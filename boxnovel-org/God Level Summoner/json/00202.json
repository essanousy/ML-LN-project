The two old players of Time were stunned by Gu Siming\u2019s quick pursuit and Xiao Han\u2019s phantom positioning. After Xiao Han\u2019s set of moves killed Liang Sejie, the remaining Liang Deyuan couldn\u2019t hold on for long and he died after the two people\u2019s joint attacks.</p><br/><p>The combination in the second stage was the archer Lu Xiao and hunter Zhou Yu. Both of them were elves and their movement speed was very fast. Together with the acceleration effect of the map, they could play a fast guerrilla battle.</p><br/><p>However, the second combination sent by Canglan was Shu Bai. Thanks to the existence of the milk god Bai Xuan, it was impossible for the archer and hunter to kill Xie Shurong in seconds. Xie Shurong\u2019s biggest feature was his fast attacks. Thanks to the full map speed bonus, he could actually catch up with the enemy archers!</p><br/><p>The audience also found that the map Cat God chose with many trees made Xie Shurong the real winner!</p><br/><p>A swordsman had teleporting skills to cross obstacles. Xie Shurong\u2019s actions were very agile as he chased around trees, making the archers on the other side annoyed. Many Canglan fans happily commented: [Tree God, he is really good at maps with trees!] [Ah Shu is handsome and earth-shattering!]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong\u2019s swordsmanship was indeed gorgeous and his attack speed was dazzling. The fragile archers of Time was slashed and became rather passive. Eventually, they were killed by the Shu Bai combination.</p><br/><p>As the Time fans expected, Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei were the last combination.</p><br/><p>Tan Cheng\u2019s remote control guerrilla tactics was one of the most classic combinations in Miracle. The residual blood Shu Bai couldn\u2019t consume much resources but Bai Xuan believed that Canglan should win this game.</p><br/><p>It was because their guards were Li Cangyu and Zhang Jueming!</p><br/><p>The two veterans with a stable mentality and rich experience confronted the younger generation of Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei. Li Cangyu and Old Zhang were very calm and didn\u2019t show a negative status.</p><br/><p>Compared to Cheng Wei, Zhang Jueming\u2019s auxiliary white magician wasn\u2019t so aggressive but they could double Li Cangyu\u2019s bursting power!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian played calmly and cleverly. He kept paying attention to Li Cangyu\u2019s pet cooldown times in case Li Cangyu cooperated with Old Zhang to use the Cataclysm skill. Li Cangyu was stared at by him and didn\u2019t want to use this big move. Instead, he looked for opportunities to slowly consume Tan Shitian\u2019s health.</p><br/><p>His attack distance was not enough to hit Tan Shitian so he aimed for Cheng Wei.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was surrounded by Cat God\u2019s various pets and his skill casting kept being interrupted. After three consecutive skills were interrupted, Cheng Wei was going crazy. Li Cangyu seemed to be reading his mind and knew what skills he wanted to use!</p><br/><p>It was no wonder. After all he was half Li Cangyu\u2019s apprentice and his white magician style was taught by Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s fans felt somewhat distressed for him. He was chased by his idol and his skills couldn\u2019t be cast. Maybe Vice-Captain Cheng would become a black fan after today\u2019s match.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s expression was very calm, like a big cat playing with a kitten. He completely controlled Cheng Wei while Tan Shitian was helpless. As the best archer in the Miracle League, he killed many opponents on the tree maps. However, this was when he could hit the opponent!</p><br/><p>Today he met an elf opponent and Li Cangyu\u2019s agility stat was higher than his. Li Cangyu moved faster than him. Often, his arrows aimed at Li Cangyu\u2019s position but Li Cangyu had already escaped. Tan Shitian had to admire Cat God\u2019s movement level. Thanks to Cat God\u2019s white outfit and the silvery forest, he seemed as elusive as the wind!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian failed to hit Cat God several times in a row and desperately had to kill Zhang Jueming as well as Cat God\u2019s pets.</p><br/><p>The result of the fight was that Li Cangyu took the lead in killing Cheng Wei and Tan Shitian also killed Zhang Jueming.</p><br/><p>However, Zhang Jueming put a fixed body control on Captain Tan before dying. Li Cangyu seized this opportunity to set off a series of explosive moves to kill Tan Shitian. By the time Tan Shitian\u2019s control effect ended and he wanted to chase Cat God, Li Cangyu had already disappeared into the forest.</p><br/><p>The elf summoner played a guerrilla warfare in the forest. Tan Shitian didn\u2019t know if he should laugh or cry. He was best at fast guerrilla tactics but today he died under Cat God\u2019s guerrilla tactics.</p><br/><p>In other words, Li Cangyu\u2019s movement speed was faster than his.</p><br/><p>\u2014The Canglan team won!</p><br/><p>At the end of the first game, the dead Tan Shitian sent a row of thumbs up on the public chat and then calmly walked down.</p><br/><p>At the venue, the Canglan fans stood up and clapped excitedly. The live room was filled with Cat God 6666. In the support group, everyone was happily discussing the deployment of the next game.</p><br/><p>[Cat God is clearly ready today! Ah, I feel like the possibility of Canglan winning is very high!] [Three arena games and the home map selection, Canglan has a really big chance of winning! [Everyone, don\u2019t talk big. Tan Shitian isn\u2019t a fuel-saving lamp. The map must be submitted first in the second game. Time has the opportunity to adjust the order according to the map selection. Perhaps Tan Shitian will think of a strategy to deal with it.]</p><br/><p>Everyone enthusiastically discussed it while in the soundproof room, the players were gathered together to listen to the captain\u2019s arrangement.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was depressed. Tan Shitian gently patted his head and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be depressed. Let\u2019s change the order in the next round.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? What do you mean?\u201d Cheng Wei looked up with surprise. \u201cYou won\u2019t be the guard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian explained, \u201cI will continue to be the guard. I mean to change your order.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to split out combination?\u201d Cheng Wei\u2019s eyes were wide with shock.</p><br/><p>The dark and big eyes were full of incredulity and Tan Shitian couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cWhy? Are you reluctant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s face turned red with anger. \u201cWho is reluctant? I mean, the two of us have never been split apart in the arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday we can\u2019t play as usual because Cat God would\u2019ve long expected the Tan Cheng combination to be the guard. He will surely be the guard in every game and choose a targeted map specifically aiming for you.\u201d Tan Shitian put away his smile and calmly spoke. \u201cThis way, no matter how big the advantage in the early stages, the last round against Cat God will be extremely difficult for us to win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei also calmed down. Captan Tan made sense. This was Canglan\u2019s home match and it would also decide the playoffs. Li Cangyu wouldn\u2019t show any mercy to Time and would specifically target them.</p><br/><p>In order to escape from danger, Time must use unconventional methods.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei thought this and nodded. \u201cOkay Captain, you arrange it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian was relieved when he saw Cheng Wei\u2019s obedient appearance. His voice was calm but contained a decisively that couldn\u2019t be rejected. \u201cIn the next game, we will change the mode. Cheng Wei and Lu Xiao will start to break apart the newcomers.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the commentators\u2019 room, Yu Bing and Kou Hongyi were giving a simple summary. Kou Hongyi directly said, \u201cIn the first game, most players played at their normal levels. However, Time couldn\u2019t keep up with the rhythm of the acceleration map and didn\u2019t expect Xiao Gu and Xiao Han to play so well. They fell into a disadvantage from the opening.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing nodded. \u201cThe Canglan team has been at a disadvantage many times in the arena in the regular season. However, if you look carefully, you will find that they never lost when they got the opening advantage. This means that it other teams want to reverse the situation, it is almost impossible.\u201d She paused and spoke with appreciation, \u201cThis is because the Shu Bai combination in the middle is extremely stable and there is also the captain Li Cangyu as the guard. It is almost impossible for other teams to continuously kill the Shu Bai combination and then Cat God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi also discovered this point and exclaimed, \u201cIn fact, at the beginning, I felt that Canglan had too many newcomers and it was dangerous for them to enter the playoffs. After seeing the performance of Xiao Gu and Xiao Han today, I suddenly found that these four little guys have been making steady progress and every step is solid, especially in mentality. They don\u2019t look nervous at all despite today\u2019s important match.\u201d</p><br/><p>The director changed the camera to the soundproof room of Canglan. The four teenagers were gathered together. Gu Siming was excitedly drawing something, Zhuo Hang was smiling, Li Xiaojiang was carefully listening and Xiao Han was thinking about something. The four people behaved differently but there wasn\u2019t the slightest bit of tension on their faces. The atmosphere was very relaxed.</p><br/><p>A professional player growing their mentality was the rarest breakthrough!</p><br/><p>It was only by practicing the mentality of \u2018not collapsing in front of a mountain\u2019 that they could play at their normal level in the stressful competition and sometimes they could even play in an extraordinary manner.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s leadership was outstanding. In just half a year, he raised the four newcomers to today\u2019s professional players. Yu Bing felt a lot of admiration and she even thought it was good if Canglan could make the playoffs.</p><br/><p>In the first season, Time won the championship under the leadership of the old captain Xu Luo. They also won it again in the fifth season under the leadership of the new captain Tan Shitian. Li Cangyu was such a good player but he hadn\u2019t received any trophies\u2026</p><br/><p>It might just be sympathy but she wanted Canglan to make it over Time this season.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing secretly looked at the audience\u2019s support rate and found that the Canglan team actually had 70% of the votes!</p><br/><p>It could be seen that apart from the loyal fans who hoped that Time could enter the playoffs, the fans of other teams and neutral viewers hoped that Canglan would get this rare opportunity.</p><br/><p>Would Canglan disappoint the audience? It depended on Li Cangyu\u2019s careful layout today!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

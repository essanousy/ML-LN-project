Some reporters interviewed players from Australia, Spain and Italy and asked them how they felt about losing to the Chinese team. Many players expressed a psychological shadow towards the Chinese team\u2019s maps.</p><br/><p>Italy\u2019s vice-captain, Villedo said, \u201cChina is a team without many masters on the world rankings. There are also several players who don\u2019t play according to common sense. We are convinced about our loss to the Chinese team and will continue to work hard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On the surface, the national team\u2019s vice-captain was calm but many people in the Italian team were frustrated. In the World Competition, they entered the quarter-finals as second in the group. However, they were clear in their hearts. If the next knockout game was against France, they didn\u2019t have much hope of winning.</p><br/><p>In the post-match interview, Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng appeared in the interview room with Tan Shitian, Su Guangmo, Lou Wushuang, Jiang Xu and Chu Yan. The media reporters were immediately excited and stood up to applaud the Chinese team\u2019s victory record.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations to the Chinese team for qualifying with all wins! I want to ask you, what are you feeling at this time? Can you give a brief summary of the group stage?\u201d A reporter stood up and looked at the commanders before finally selecting Tan Shitian. \u201cWould Captain Tan like to speak first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian glanced at Li Cangyu. \u201cShould the captain speak first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu told him, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you are first. My final summary will be the same.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian said, \u201cThen I\u2019ll speak first. Cough, I\u2019m really happy that the national team can win with all victories. In the three matches of the group stage, we chose different tactics for different countries. The final result shows that Cat God\u2019s decision is correct. The command in each game was very strong and the players were also excellent.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter couldn\u2019t pick any faults with Tan Shitian\u2019s answer and handed the microphone to Chu Yan. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Yan replied, \u201cI am very pleased that the illusion flow tactic can be seen in the World Competition. My wish has been half completed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the other half?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is naturally to follow the national team to win the prize!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was warm applause at this answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does Captain Jiang have to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Xu smiled and spoke in a calm tone, \u201cI am very happy that my double taunting lineup can be recognized by all of you in this World Competition. I am thankful to the players of the national team. Their standards are very strong and my ideas were realized in the field. I am very pleased.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Yan and Jiang Xu\u2019s team scores in the domestic league weren\u2019t excellent but their personal standards and commanding abilities couldn\u2019t be denied. Li Cangyu was quite bold to use them.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo picked up the microphone and spoke aggressively, \u201cI found a problem in the group stage. The captains of many countries use the world rankings as the standard for judging a player. This is actually very unreliable! In recent years, many newcomers have emerged in China and they hadn\u2019t had time to participate in the world rankings. Returning players like Cat God and Vice-Captain Bai also didn\u2019t participate in the rankings last year. Too many people are missing from the rankings and they should be reshuffled after this competition!\u201d</p><br/><p>He always had a straightforward personality and wasn\u2019t afraid of criticizing the world rankings. Then he turned to Tan Shitian and polite wondered, \u201cCaptain Tan, can you go back and write a paragraph about this point?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled. \u201cI only write about cats and dogs.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo sincerely suggested, \u201cThis time you can write about Australian koalas, Spanish bulls and Chinese pandas.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian coughed. \u201cCaptain Su shouldn\u2019t take this topic too far!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang watched the interview backstage and couldn\u2019t help laughing. The two of them were his uncle and his cousin. Their private relationship was really good but in front of the reporters, they were like, \u201cWhat a coincidence to see Captain Tan here\u201d and \u201cHello Captain Su, nice to meet you.\u201d Thus, Zhuo Hang was worried for both of them.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu knew the truth and didn\u2019t say anything. He just looked at the two men. Su and Tan were known to be close friends in private but they had similar first-class acting in front of reporters. They could be actors if they stopped being e-sports players.</p><br/><p>At this time, the microphone ended up in the hands of the cold king, Lou Wushuang. Lou Wushuang was like a natural air conditioner as he sat there. The eyes behind his glasses were cold and didn\u2019t contain any emotion. His eyes swept over the reporters and he spoke indifferently, \u201cI am very happy that the national team can win with an all victories record.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience, \u201c\u2026\u201d We really can\u2019t see that you are happy!</p><br/><p>He spoke a simple sentence and handed the microphone to Li Cangyu. Li Cangyu took the microphone and said, \u201cThen I will summarize it. Our complete victory in the group stage is due to the contribution of the 22 members of the national team. The several commanders present here are even more important. I believe that the strength of the national team and the maps designed by the Chinese map designers are very distinctive. It isn\u2019t an accident that we could achieve a complete victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded in agreement. \u201cYes, the map advantage in the group stage is really great. However, this advantage will be weakened in the knockout rounds. We will also be facing stronger opponents in the knockouts.\u201d</p><br/><p>A reporter asked, \u201cThe national team has many commanders and everyone has different ideas. Has there been an inconsistencies in the command during the group stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied, \u201cSo far, there hasn\u2019t been many arguments because every game is handled by different commanders and the national team is very harmonious. Still, there is no denying that this might happen in future games. Different people have different tactics. You can rest assured that even if there is an argument, I will do a good job adjusting it with Xuefeng.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter received a satisfactory reply and sat down. Someone next to him stood up and asked, \u201cCat God said that the maps designed by the Chinese team are very distinctive. We can see that the Mechanical City, Mount Huangshan Plank Road and Bamboo Sea have Chinese elements and their design ideas are very innovative. We didn\u2019t get to see the full image of Suzhou Gardens, which was banned in the previous match, and there is also a map that hasn\u2019t shown up at all. Will it appear in the knockout stages?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded with a smile. \u201cIt is for certain. The World Competition has adjusted the probability and it is highly likely that maps that haven\u2019t been played will emerge later. You will definitely meet these two maps in the later stages.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporter then asked, \u201cIt is said that the system is slightly adjusted for the knockout stages. Can Cat God explain it in detail?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Li Cangyu patiently explained. \u201cThere are still three types of mode, the arena, death racing and economic war. The group stage was a B03 three games, two victories system. The knockouts are a B05 five games three victories system. This is to minimize any unexpected factors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe specific adjusted rules are similar to our domestic playoffs. The home team can choose the map and mode while the away team can send players to target them. The home and away teams will swap with every game. If each team achieves two victories, a final random tiebreaker will be selected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was afraid people wouldn\u2019t understand and gave an example, \u201cIf the Chinese team meets France in the quarter-finals, the captains of the two teams will decide who goes first with a draw. If I get the first move, I will play at home and decide the mode and map. The French team will wait for us to send our players before sending a targeted lineup. After the first game, the home team is swapped. France will decide the map and mode while the Chinese team will send people. If it is a 2:2 draw after four games, the fifth game will be a random mode and random map.\u201d</p><br/><p>Some reporters asked curiously, \u201cIf you choose a map, is it a fixed map?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu shook his head. \u201cThe domestic league is a fixed map but the World Competition is different. You can choose three maps from the Miracle gallery and those submitted. The opponent has the right to disable two maps and leave one to play the game. The map that has been used can\u2019t be chosen again in the next game.\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters figured it out. It was impossible to use the same map to trap others twice. In addition, the map with the most pits was likely to be banned by the opponent.</p><br/><p>They had asked up to here when a reporter excitedly stood up and exclaimed, \u201cCat God! Your words came true. The Chinese team\u2019s opponent in the quarter-finals is France!\u201d</p><br/><p>HIs words shocked those present.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had an expression of \u2018What?\u2019 It seemed even he didn\u2019t think he would have a crow\u2019s mouth and his words would become true\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked at him helplessly. Li Cangyu touched his nose and smiled innocently. \u201cI was just talking casually.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was really surprising. The French team\u2019s performance in Group D had been very good and it was reasonable for them to be ranked first. Thus, they should avoid the quarter-finals with the Chinese team. Since the reporter said that France was China\u2019s opponent, it meant the French team won second place in Group D.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the reporter followed up with, \u201cThe match just ended. The British team defeated France in the economic war and death racing. Originally, the two countries had similar points. After the match, the British team won first in Group D and France qualified in second place. They will meet the Chinese team in the quarter-finals!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cOh, it was like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The reporters were worried. \u201cThe overall strength of the French team is actually very strong. It is likely that some of the players were ill today. If Cat God encounters them in the quarter-finals, what are your plans?\u2019</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked over at Ling Xuefeng and whispered into his ears, \u201cIf I remember correctly, the captain of the French team is an old friend of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ling Xuefeng answered very calmly. \u201cI explained it to your before. I only knew him when playing the online game on the US server. I haven\u2019t seen him in many years and don\u2019t have much contact with him. Don\u2019t think too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied lightly, \u201cI\u2019m not thinking too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, he was thinking, \u2018How good is it that I can abuse the captain of the French team? He seemed to be very arrogant when I met him that day in the hallway?\u2019</p><hr/><br/><p>The author has something to say:</p><br/><p>Cat God running to abuse Ling Xuefeng\u2019s buddy.</p><br/><p>Xuefeng: You can eat fish. Don\u2019t be jealous.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: I\u2019m not jealous. My hands are just itching.</p><br/><p>Captain of the French team: I suddenly feel a killing energy QAQ.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If you don\u2019t want to talk with Zhuo Hang, go next door to find me and Xiao Han to chat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang knew that Gu Siming really cared about him.</p><br/><p>Of the other three peers on the team, Zhuo Hang smiled all day and looked sunny but he was actually very arrogant and difficult to get close to. His smile was just a distant politeness. Xiao Han\u2019s brain circuits weren\u2019t the same as everyone else and his words used were sometimes strange. Only Gu Siming was enthusiastic and sincerely cared about him.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang might be a slow child but he wasn\u2019t stupid. He could feel the attitude of others towards him.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was a bit sad about being separated from Gu Siming. He couldn\u2019t help lowering his head as he said, \u201cI, I know. I will go next door to find, to find you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming hadn\u2019t closed his door when packing. Zhuo Hang had just arrived at the door when he heard this conversation. He couldn\u2019t help feeling depressed. Did Li Xiaojiang actually hate him that much? What was going on with Gu Siming here?</p><br/><p>He endured this feeling and knocked on the door. Gu Siming turned back to open the door and cried out, \u201cSince this is Cat God\u2019s arrangement, I won\u2019t say anything more. You shouldn\u2019t bully Xiao Li in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then in the eyes of others, he was a big bastard who would bully Li Xiaojiang?</p><br/><p>He looked into the room and happened to meet Li Xiaojiang\u2019s wet black eyes. As a result, something like fear filled the latter\u2019s eyes and he removed his gaze, immediately shrinking back.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang who was treated as a bad person, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming reluctantly pulled his luggage out and didn\u2019t forget to look back to tell him, \u201cDon\u2019t bully Xiao Li, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang rolled his eyes. \u201cReally long-winded! Go to sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>He drove Gu Siming to the next room and pulled his luggage inside, locking the door.</p><br/><p>He looked up and found that Li Xiaojiang was looking down, hands clenched tightly and not speaking. It was like he was prepared to enter combat against an enemy.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang finally couldn\u2019t bear it and stepped forward. \u201cWhy are you so afraid of me? I\u2019m not a man-eating beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s face was slightly red as he retorted, \u201cI, I\u2019m not afraid of you. I\u2026 I\u2019m a bit nervous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nervous? Zhuo Hang was startled and frowned. \u201cWhy are you nervous? Am I hard to get along with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was silent for a moment before whispering, \u201cI, I thought you hated me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang actually didn\u2019t like Li Xiaojiang\u2019s slow personality. After all, most of his family were refreshing and resolute. Li Xiaojiang was slow in everything and his words were hesitated. He would take half a minute to say something that other people could say in five seconds and he would also stutter. Zhuo Hang wanted to reach out and straighten his tongue.</p><br/><p>However, looking at this pathetic appearance that was like a bullied stray cat, Zhuo Hang felt very awkward. It was as if he had become a big bully!</p><br/><p>He coughed with embarrassment as he remembered Cat God telling him to get along with the other person. Zhuo Hang reached out gently to touch Li Xiaojiang\u2019s head and smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t hate you. It is just that I\u2019m not familiar with you and there isn\u2019t much common language. Don\u2019t think too much. We can become familiar with each other later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, Li Xiaojiang\u2019s hair was very soft to touch and his height was just right. It was very easy to pat his head.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang heard this and looked up with surprise. \u201cYes, yes? You don\u2019t, you don\u2019t hate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>His black eyes were clear like gems, making Zhuo Hang feel guilty.</p><br/><p>Looking closely, he found that Li Xiaojiang had a very flattering face. His height was relatively small since he was almost 18 years old and was still less than 175cm. He was the shortest one on the Canglan team and his face was also very small as it could be held with one hand. HIs body was thin and there weren\u2019t many muscles on his thin arms and legs.</p><br/><p>Why did Zhou Hang want to compete with such a weak guy?</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang saw that Li Xiaojiang was still looking at him seriously and moved his line of sight. \u201cCough, in any case, Cat God arranged for us to be roommates. Later we should take care of each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang agreed happily. \u201cYes, yes!\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Li Xiaojiang was simple and easy to satisfy.</p><br/><p>Becoming a professional player of the Canglan team was already a great fortune for him. He had been stuttering since an early age and often receive a cold reception from others. He had been accustomed to this treatment and didn\u2019t find it strange that Zhuo Hang hated him. He didn\u2019t think Zhuo Hang was wrong, he just felt a bit sad about being hated.</p><br/><p>Today, Zhuo Hang said he didn\u2019t hate Li Xiaojiang. It was just that they weren\u2019t familiar with each other. Li Xiaojiang\u2019s mood instantly became happy. He opened his suitcase and took out a package of well-preserved duck neck and said, \u201cThis, this is for you to eat. Do you like, like it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang didn\u2019t like to eat duck neck as a snack. When Li Xiaojiang brought back a whole bunch for the team, he only ate half a packet before giving the rest to Gu Siming.</p><br/><p>However, Li Xiaojiang was currently smiling at him and Zhuo Hang couldn\u2019t bear to say words of rejection. He reached out and smiled. \u201cThank you, it is very delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang saw him smiling and also smiled happily. \u201cIs it? I, I also think it is very delicious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang didn\u2019t want to talk to Li Xiaojiang for a bit so he suggested, \u201cYou go take a shower first. I will unpack my luggage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Li Xiaojiang ran to the bathroom to take a shower. Zhuo Hang opened his suitcase and took out the clothes to be worn tomorrow. Then he sat on the bed and played games on his iPad.</p><br/><p>Five minutes after he started playing, Li Xiaojiang quickly came out. Zhuo Hang was a bit surprised, \u201cYou have finished already?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s face was red from the steam. He spoke while rubbing his hair with a towel. \u201cYes, I wash up and shower quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang smiled and asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you a slow person? How did you suddenly become fast when showering?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang explained seriously, \u201cMy body isn\u2019t dirty. Just casually washing is fine since it won\u2019t waste water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this the different living environment that Cat God was talking about?</p><br/><p>When Zhuo Hang was a child, he often filled a bathtub with water and spend half an hour playing with bubbles. Once the bubbles were gone, he had to wash again. The concept of saving water was never mentioned by his parents.</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was different. He had been frugal since he was a child and wasn\u2019t used to showering for half an hour.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang thought about it and felt more awkward. He grew up like this since he was a child and never felt there was anything wrong with it. How did he become a sinner when compared with Li Xiaojiang? Even the long washing time, a problem he had never noticed before, suddenly produced a sense of guilt\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang was thinking about this when Li Xiaojiang came over in big pyjamas. The hotel pyjamas he was wearing went down to the ankle, making him look like a small white zongzi. (TL: traditional Chinese rice dish made of glutinous rice stuffed with different fillings and wrapped in bamboo leaves)</p><br/><p>As he climbed into his bed, his pyjamas opened a bit and Zhuo Hang saw his underwear.</p><br/><p>It was cartoon shorts with a robot cat printed on it.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Actually wearing this type of cartoon robot cat shorts, Li Xiaojiang, is your sense of aesthetics eaten by a dog?\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang was a blunt person and he couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhy are you still wearing this type of children\u2019s underwear? 18 years old is already counted as an adult. Changing to a pure colour is better. I think white suits you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was startled and looked down at his cartoon underwear, his cheeks slightly red. \u201cI, I didn\u2019t bring white\u2026 I only brought three pairs to wear\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang asked, \u201cWhat are the other two?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang pointed to the closet. Zhuo Hang opened it and found that there were two clean underwear inside. The pattern and shape made him stunned. They were still cartoon shorts. The various cartoon characters and small size reminded him of what primary school students wore.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang decided to save Li Xiaojiang\u2019s aesthetics, otherwise this guy wouldn\u2019t be able to get a wife when he was older.</p><br/><p>He turned back and pulled out a packet of new underwear that hadn\u2019t been worn yet. He picked a white one and handed it to Li Xiaojiang. \u201cTry to wear this. It has a protective cover over a male\u2019s key parts. If you wear loose boxers everyday, don\u2019t you feel like it is uncomfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were both boys and peers. Thus, Zhuo Hang felt there was nothing wrong discussing this type of problem. In high school, didn\u2019t he often gather around with his roommates to look at those type of magazines?</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang\u2019s nature was shy and no one had ever said this to him before. His ears were red as he accepted the sexy white underwear given by Zhuo Hang. Li Xiaojiang felt like he was taking a hot potato.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang said, \u201cThis is a new purchase and I have never worn it. The trademark hasn\u2019t been cut. It is definitely more comfortable than your boxers. The white one is for you. Take it and try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang nodded and silently changed under the blanket.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang asked, \u201cHow is it? Is it comfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was silent for a moment before stuttering with a red face, \u201cI wore it, it is a bit big, big\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang quickly understood. This guy\u2019s thing must be small and the underwear was too big for him.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang looked at Li Xiaojiang\u2019s red face and finally reacted. Damn, why had he used this topic to become familiar with each other? What was wrong with him, talking about underwear?</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang wanted to slap himself and immediately changed the topic. \u201cWhat time do you usually sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang answered, \u201c11, 11 o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang suggested, \u201cThere is still one hour left. Do you want to play a game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang asked, \u201cMiracle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you tired of playing Miracle every day? I will recommend a mobile game. It is fun and also lets you practice your reaction speed.\u201d Zhuo Hang opened his iPad to a shooting game. He sat next to Li Xiaojiang to show him. \u201cThe left side is the sight and the right side is the shooting button. The next button fills you up with bullets. This is up and down and left and right. Avoid the bullets and kill the opposite side to achieve victory.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang made a curious expression and nodded earnestly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang started a game. There were gunshots and several opponents were consecutively shot in the head. The prompt \u2018Congratulations, you have passed\u2019 appeared on the screen. Zhuo Hang handed the iPad to Li Xiaojiang and said, \u201cCome and try.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was Li Xiaojiang\u2019s first time playing on the iPad and he was very excited. He tried to shoot and ended up being shot to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m not very good at playing.\u201d Li Xiaojiang handed the iPad back to Zhuo Hang with a red face.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang laughed. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Try it a few more times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Li Xiaojiang accepted the iPad again and pressed start.</p><br/><p>This game was much better. Li Xiaojiang hid behind obstacles and slowly aimed. Then he got up to shoot and the opponent really fell down. Li Xiaojiang continued to hide behind obstacles and played slowly. After playing for 10 minutes, he finally passed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI passed!\u201d Li Xiaojiang\u2019s face filled with joy and his eyes shone.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang saw this and couldn\u2019t help smiling.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t mind Li Xiaojiang\u2019s slowness, this guy was actually good to get along with. His mind was simple and he hadn\u2019t seen the big world. If Zhuo Hang was good to him, he would be good back.</p><br/><p>He was like a stray cat that was easy to satisfy. Just give him something to eat and he would follow you to death.</p><br/><p>The more he saw Li Xiaojiang seriously holding the iPad, the more Zhuo Hang thought that this guy was cute. Why did he hate Li Xiaojiang before? In fact, it was because his sense of pride that made him think Li Xiaojiang would drag him down.</p><br/><p>In fact, Li Xiaojiang was a hard-working person.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang just needed to watch him play this shooting game to know he was serious about everything he did.</p><br/><p>When he played this game, he lost and lost. However, Li Xiaojiang focused as he played. Every time he shot, he considered it very carefully, allowing him to achieve a killing blow every time.</p><br/><p>He took a longer time then Zhuo Hang but his seriousness was hard to match.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang finally understood why Cat God wanted him to live with Li Xiaojiang. Li Xiaojiang had many advantages, especially the patience and seriousness that Zhuo Hang lacked.</p><br/><p>An active exchange with Li Xiaojiang was still awkward but Su Guangmo, Tan Shitian and Li Cangyu were staring at him. Once he made a mistake, the three gods would scold him.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang had to obey Cat God\u2019s arrangement and slowly adapt to the environment of the team.</p><br/><p>From now on, he must try to accept Li Xiaojiang\u2019s existence.</p><br/><p>According to Cat God, Xie Shurong would play a demonstration game with Li Xiaojiang in the next match. Then the match after that would be Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang again\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang still had no clue on how to cooperate with Li Xiaojiang but he would calm down and slowly learn. At the very least, he shouldn\u2019t be scolded by the three captains in the next match. Even if he lost, he had to play to his own standards and not make it as shameful as the first match.</p><br/><p>There was a moment of silence as Zhuo Hang finally understood. He smiled slightly and turned to Li Xiaojiang. \u201cXiaojiang, there might\u2019ve been a misunderstanding between us. From today, shall we be friends?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang put down the iPad and looked up at Zhuo Hang, somewhat flattered.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang saw a small animal\u2019s frightened eyes and couldn\u2019t help reaching out to touch his head. \u201cAre you still afraid of me? You look so shocked.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang said with a red face, \u201cI, I didn\u2019t mean that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that Zhuo Hang\u2019s family was very good and there were several great gods as relatives. He thought that Zhuo Hang would look down on him. He didn\u2019t expect that Zhuo Hang would uncharacteristically volunteer to become friends with him.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang saw Li Xiaojiang\u2019s doubts and reached out to gently hold Li Xiaojiang\u2019s hand. \u201cThen it is decided!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

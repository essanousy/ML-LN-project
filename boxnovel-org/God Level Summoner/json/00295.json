Meanwhile, he and Ling Xuefeng went to Bai Xuan\u2019s room to visit the patient.</p><br/><p>The two people entered and saw Bai Xuan apparently having lunch. There was a bowl of rice porridge on the table next to the bed that was cooling down. Li Cangyu saw Bai Xuan lying in bed and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWas this porridge brought by Ah Shu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled. \u201cYes, he bought takeaway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu patted Xie Shurong on the shoulder and praised him. \u201cYou have grown. Now you know how to take care of patients.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong proudly replied, \u201cOf course, everything he ate in the last two days were personally picked by me. His stomach is almost better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at Bai Xuan with concern. \u201cIs it really better?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bai Xuan nodded and said, \u201cIn fact, my stomach didn\u2019t hurt yesterday. I originally wanted to go to the venue to watch the match but Ah Shu refused to let me go. He wanted me to rest for another day so I had to watch live on the TV.\u201d He paused and looked at LI Cangyu with smiling eyes. \u201cThe match was amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw the familiar, gentle smile and couldn\u2019t help softening as he patted Bai Xuan on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry about the game every day. Rest your body and I will think about sending you to play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan told him seriously, \u201cI am already well-rested.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t believe it. \u201cYou love to act strong. Who knows if what you said is true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan glanced at him. \u201cI\u2019m really good. Would I lie to you? Let me play in the next game. Today, I saw all of you playing so handsomely and I want to knock on the keyboard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Every time Li Cangyu and Bai Xuan were together, the other two would be treated as air.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was extremely depressed but with his current identity, he couldn\u2019t drive out the captain. Fortunately, Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t resist the intimate atmosphere and took the initiative to come forward. \u201cBai Xuan still needs to rest. We shouldn\u2019t bother him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu felt this was reasonable and stood up. \u201cThen you rest for half a day. If there are no problems tomorrow morning, come to the meeting room at 8 o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people walked out.</p><br/><p>Once the door closed, Xie Shurong instantly rushed to the bed and hugged Bai Xuan. He didn\u2019t say anything and directly kissed the other person.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan was caught off guard by this suddenly sticky person and pushed him. Xie Shurong just clasped the back of Bai Xuan\u2019s head and his teeth moved more deeply.</p><br/><p>Unlike the warm and gentle kisses of the past, this kiss contained a strong possessive desire. The tongue eagerly swept through the mouth without letting go of one inch. Bai Xuan was almost suffocated before Xie Shurong reluctantly let him go.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan opened his mouth and gasped. Once his breathing was restored, he stared at Xie Shurong and asked, \u201cWhy are you suddenly acting like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m your boyfriend.\u201d He extended his arms to hug Bai Xuan, placing his chin on Bai Xuan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cBut your eyes are full of Cat God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this idiot jealous? Sure enough, his IQ had regressed to the kindergarten level and he still wanted to be spoiled?</p><br/><p>Such a big person acting like this, wasn\u2019t it shameful?</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at the young man hugging him with a wronged expression and felt like he had become a kindergarten teacher. He had no choice but to touch Xie Shurong\u2019s head. \u201cI grew up with Cat God and have been partners for seven years. He and I\u2026 there is nothing like that between us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah Shu actually knew this very well.</p><br/><p>Still, he couldn\u2019t help feeling jealous when he saw Bai Xuan and Li Cangyu acting intimately.</p><br/><p>It was probably because he cared too much about this person?</p><br/><p>He was worried that he wouldn\u2019t be worthy and paid special attention to Bai Xuan\u2019s relationship with others.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong hated his petty self and couldn\u2019t help tightening his grip on Bai Xuan, afraid the other person would leave. He whispered, \u201cBai Xuan, do you think that I am very immature?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan thought, \u2018You are really self-aware!\u2019</p><br/><p>In order to avoid hitting him, Bai Xuan didn\u2019t say anything and patiently patted his shoulder.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong continued in a low voice, \u201cI know that I\u2019m very immature and shouldn\u2019t eat vinegar regarding you and Cat God. Still, I can\u2019t help it. I care too much about you and I\u2019m afraid that you will like others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This was clearly a childish notion but it made Bai Xuan feel soft.</p><br/><p>This guy really wasn\u2019t mature enough and also inexplicably became jealous, but Bai Xuan could feel his sincere heart.</p><br/><p>Maybe he minded so much because he cared so deeply for one person?</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help inwardly sighing and his voice was soft. \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t like Li Cangyu and I won\u2019t like others. Don\u2019t think too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was immediately excited and kissed Bai Xuan again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan was helpless against this guy and had to open his mouth again.</p><br/><p>Ah Shu had been particularly careful the past two days and took care of him all night. His boyfriend was full of strength.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong might be childish but this was his true self. He didn\u2019t deliberately pretend to be mature and steady. If there was anything in his heart, he would bluntly say it. It was actually very easy to get along with such people.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan thought this and couldn\u2019t help smiling slightly before he closed his eyes and accepted Xie Shurong\u2019s kiss.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the next room, Li Cangyu entered the bathroom and took a bath.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s vinegar was quickly suppressed. After all, he wasn\u2019t the spoiled Xie Shurong who tried to sell meng. He could rationally control his emotions.</p><br/><p>However, once Li Cangyu came out of the bathroom, he still pulled the other person into his arms.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was caught off guard and his mind became blank.</p><br/><p>The kiss was extraordinarily long and Ling Xuefeng\u2019s tongue swept madly across the other person\u2019s mouth, as if to declare ownership. There was a type of strength that couldn\u2019t be rejected.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Li Cangyu\u2019s spirit returned and he noticed he was kissed. He didn\u2019t push the other person away and actively kissed back.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s soft ribs were hit at once.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu could always make him feel like this and the previous vinegar had long been thrown away. Ling Xuefeng stretched out his arms and gently hugged his passionate lover, the kiss becoming gentle.</p><br/><p>The two people exchanged a long kiss before reluctantly letting go.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu stuck out his tongue and rubbed the other person\u2019s lips. He held Ling Xuefeng\u2019s waist and smiled. \u201cAre you so active today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked at him gently. \u201cAren\u2019t you active as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu told him, \u201cI am rewarding you. The super god is too handsome and you took responsibility for translating for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled and pulled him closer, whispering, \u201cActually, I was a bit jealous.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu glanced up at him with surprise. \u201cWere you? Why didn\u2019t I see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because I held back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cWhat vinegar are you eating?\u201d Me and Bai Xuan? Don\u2019t joke around. After so many years of brotherhood, I only look at him as a relative. I will never be tempted by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he kissed Ling Xuefeng\u2019s lips and stated seriously, \u201cI\u2019m yours. Never doubt this.\u201d</p><br/><p>I\u2019m yours.</p><br/><p>These words instantly penetrated through all of Ling Xuefeng\u2019s defenses.</p><br/><p>This was more touching than any vows.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng tightly hugged Li Cangyu like he was holding the most precious baby.</p><br/><p>\u2018I am also yours. We only belong together, there is no doubt.\u2019</p><br/>\n</div>"}

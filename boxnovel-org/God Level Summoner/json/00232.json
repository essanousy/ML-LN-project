It was the chairman\u2019s assistant, Sister Lin Xiaotong. Her voice was very gentle, \u201cCat God, do you have time now to go to the meeting room on the 14th floor? The chairman wants a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019ll be right there.\u201d Li Cangyu headed to the meeting room on the 14th floor. He was well aware that the chairman wanted to discuss the World Competition with him.</p><br/><p>Lin Xiaotong stood at the elevator to pick him up and led him to the meeting room at the end of the hallway. The thing that surprised him was the two very familiar faces that appeared when he opened the door\u2014Liu Chuan and Xiao Sijing.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan was the boss of the Dragon Song Club and shouldn\u2019t be here. Then after seeing Xiao Sijing standing next to him, Li Cangyu immediately reacted. They must be here as executive directors of the E-Sports League.</p><br/><p>The year that Li Cangyu transferred to Wulin happened to be the year of Liu Chuan\u2019s return. The Canglan team led by Li Cangyu fought against Liu Chuan many times. The Seven Stars Grass team was a strong team on the Wulin side. As the first captain of the Seven Stars Grass team, Xiao Sijing was very popular in the Wulin League and the strongest enemy on Liu Chuan\u2019s road to winning.</p><br/><p>That was already three years ago. Later, Liu Chuan retired behind the scenes to establish the Dragon Song Club and joined the E-Sports League. Xiao Sijing was a coach after retiring before also being invited to join China\u2019s E-Sports League.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan and Xiao Sijing, the two former e-sports gods were currently working at the headquarters of the league. This time, the selection of the Miracle national team must be supervised by headquarters personnel to avoid accusations of unfairness.</p><br/><p>Both of them probably appeared here because headquarters sent them to supervise the trials.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu quickly figured this out and took the initiative to reach out to Xiao Sijing. \u201cXiao Sijing, I haven\u2019t seen you in a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Sijing shook hands with him. \u201cCongratulations on winning the championship. I also went to watch and you played very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to Liu Chuan\u2019s hateful smile, Xiao Sijing\u2019s mature and stable style seemed much more reliable. The league headquarters probably sent both of them over because they were previously e-sports players. The various systems of e-sports would be easier for them to understand.</p><br/><p>They were talking when the door opened and Li Cangyu saw Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>\u201cXuefeng, you are here as well?\u201d Li Cangyu asked with a bit of surprise.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded and walked over to Li Cangyu\u2019s side. He asked Chairman Nan \u201cChairman, did you ask me over to discuss the World Competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan smiled and nodded. \u201cYes, let me introduce you first. These two people are Liu Chuan and Xiao Sijing, executive directors of the E-Sports League Headquarters. The league sent them to supervise the national team trials to avoid any unfairness. The two of them will also serve as referees for the trials.\u201d</p><br/><p>The E-Sports League governed many types of competitive games, including competitive mobile games, tablet games, computer games, etc. Wulin and Miracle were two of the biggest projects. They had the most formal leagues, the most professional players and the highest popularity.</p><br/><p>It was normal to send people when setting up a national team.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng naturally knew Liu Chuan. He was the boss of the Dragon Song Club where the Canglan team was located. This was his first time seeing Xiao Sijing. The two men looked at each other and shook hands.</p><br/><p>Apart from Chairman Nan and the four great gods, there were two girls in the conference room. One of them was Chairman Nan\u2019s assistant while the other was a secretary sent by the league headquarters. The two of them sat at the conference table and opened their notebook to make a meeting record.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan saw everyone sitting down and kept speaking, \u201cWe will first start by deciding the vice-captain of the national team. Cat God, you won\u2019t have a problem being the captain right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cI recommend Ling Xuefeng to be the captain of the national team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone turned towards him with a startled expression.</p><br/><p>Being the captain of the national team was a great honor. Many people were eager to be the captain yet Li Cangyu wanted to give it away?</p><br/><p>The named Ling Xuefeng immediately questioned it. \u201cWhy? You obviously have the ability and Canglan won the championship this season. This is enough for you to be the captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s reason was very straightforward. \u201cI am bad in English. I will have to deal with reporters abroad and also participate in various conferences. If I am the captain, I would have to bring a translation dictionary with me. Your English is good and you are more reliable as the captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng asked, \u201cDo you think this reason holds up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu stared at him, eyes extraordinarily serious. \u201cI have left Miracle for three years. It will be hard for me to serve as captain of the national team as soon as I come back. You are different. You have been here for all seven years and your foundation is stable. The national team will definitely be a gathering of great people. The key is to ensure that everyone listens to the captain. I am more suitable as the vice-captain. I can stay in the team and be responsible for arranging the training of the players.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng gave him a look. \u201cIn fact, you are too lazy to go outside and want to train in the dormitory every day, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was discovered by you.\u201d Li Cangyu touched his nose and smiled. \u201cI just want to stay home and seriously consider tactics.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng glanced at Chairman Nan, who felt very helpless. \u201cCough, the World League has stipulated that the captain of the championship team will be directly appointed as captain of the national team. Old Cat, you can\u2019t change even if you want to! To be honest, both of you have the strength to be captain but the rules are like this and it isn\u2019t good to change them in private. Then\u2026 Captain Ling will be the vice-captain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied simply, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to quit. How about you stay and train with the team while I deal with things like interviews?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu heard this and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cOkay. Interviews and other matters will be handed over to you. You shouldn\u2019t feel wronged when you are the vice-captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>He really had the nature of a cat. Li Cangyu wanted to stay home and concentrate on the team. This was also in line with his personality. Ling Xuefeng thought of this and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cI understand what you are thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was very happy. He really hated English interviews. If he said the wrong words, wouldn\u2019t he be a joke like Xiao Han in Chinese? It was right to leave these things to Ling Xuefeng. Ling Xuefeng\u2019s English was first-class and he was suitable to be the image of the national team.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan looked at the two men and felt very complicated. According to Ling Xuefeng, Li Cangyu would only be the captain in name while he was do the work of the vice-captain. Meanwhile, Ling Xuefeng was the vice-captain in name but he would be doing the captain\u2019s work\u2026</p><br/><p>Did they need to do this?</p><br/><p>Since Li Cangyu and LIng Xuefeng didn\u2019t disagree, Chairman Nan also didn\u2019t object. He immediately clapped and exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s decided! The national team will be left to you. The division of tasks can be negotiated privately.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people tacitly glanced at each other and smiled.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan then said, \u201cNext is to determine the selection of the national team. I wanted to call all the captains to discuss it but I changed my mind. The more people there are, the more disagreement there will be. We might argue all day. Thus, I will leave it to the two of you to directly decide.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence was a great gift to Ling Xuefeng and Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>The captain and vice-captain would decide the lineup of the national team. This was equivalent to being in control of the national team\u2019s life and death. It was enough to see Chairman Nan\u2019s trust in both of them.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan gave them a copy of the World League\u2019s notice and explained, \u201cThe latest notice from the World League states that the captains of the championship and runner-up team of the domestic leagues are automatically eligible to join the national team. Other candidates and classes will be freely determined by the country.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it the captains of the winning and runner-up team, not the vice-captain of the championship team?\u201d Li Cangyu asked doubtfully.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan explained, \u201cIt is because many countries only have captains and no vice-captains. It is only relatively large leagues like China, the United States, France and South Korea who will have vice-captains to take care of training in the team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had a clear understanding of this point and nodded. Then he asked, \u201cWhat is the maximum number of people in the national team?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan answered, \u201cThe total number of people is 22. Apart from the two of you, there are 20 places that can be freely determined.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng glanced at each other with surprise. They thought that the national team would be 10 people at most yet there was actually 22 spots!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng expressed his doubts. \u201cThere are so many people. Does this mean the system has changed again?\u201d Otherwise, 10 people would be enough for a team battle and arena.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan finally spoke up with a smile. \u201cI just came back from the US a few days ago. The meaning of the World League is that the scale of the first World Competition should be bigger. If there is no difference with the domestic leagues then the strength of the World Competition won\u2019t be seen. Thus, they have added a special event to the World Competition called the Death Racing mode.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu frowned. \u201cDeath Racing mode? I\u2019ve never heard of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan shrugged. \u201cThe World League naturally wants to use new tricks to give the audience a sense of freshness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Sijing\u2019s explanation followed. \u201cThe World Competition will play three rounds per match, which will be the arena, team battle and death racing respectively. The participants in the three games can\u2019t be repeated, which is the reason for relaxing the quota of the national team. The death racing mode will be played by five people. They will randomly refresh on the map and the first team to take 10 heads will win.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them were speechless. They could say that the bigwigs in the World League were very smart. This mode would definitely be exciting to play. However, 22 people was too large. Wouldn\u2019t it be hard to control the team?</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan smiled as he saw their complicated expressions. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t feel too much pressure. Let\u2019s first confirm the lineup. The national team\u2019s lineup needs to be comprehensively considered. How will you arrange the other 20 people?\u201d</p><br/><p>The league had issued a notice so they could only accept the rules and choose the most comprehensive lineup.</p><br/><p>Xiao Sijing handed a piece of paper with information on it to the two people. \u201cThis is the result of my investigation with Liu Chuan in the past few weeks. The names, classes and characteristics of the aces of most countries are listed here. You can take a look at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men took the material and read them. Then LIng Xuefeng said softly, \u201cSince there are two team battles, at least two healers must be taken. There must also be at least two assassins, black magicians and white magicians to form a better cooperation. Together with our two summoners, this is already 10 places.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded in agreement. \u201cWe must also bring a psychic based on the information listed. The European countries have the psychic illusionist flow as a mainstream style. If we don\u2019t bring a psychic then we will be at a disadvantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we also have to bring melee or the front row will be too weak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about archers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe don\u2019t need too much archers. Two is enough. The national team isn\u2019t the Time team and it is impossible to play the kite flow style.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould we select based on class? Or should we split it by remote and melee?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s limit it to number of people per class. Otherwise, there is likely to be too many of one class. The final lineup should be comprehensive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt makes sense. However, I also think there should be two mobile quotas so the lineup isn\u2019t too rigid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng discussed arrangements for the national team. The other people couldn\u2019t interrupt and could only watch silently from the side.</p><br/><p>The two girls recording the meeting minutes were crying. Two great gods, can\u2019t you speak a bit slower? You might have a tacit understanding but we can\u2019t keep up with you!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>A few minutes later, Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng finished discussing the lineup and showed it to Chairman Nan.</p><br/><p>Two summoners, two black magicians, two white magicians, two hunters, two assassins, two swordsmen, two front-row tankers, two healers, two psychics, two bards and the remaining two people were free choice.</p><br/><p>The 22 member national team lineup could be decided so quickly, showing the high efficiency when these two men worked together.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan asked, \u201cWhat does free choice mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu explained, \u201cThe quota is free. It isn\u2019t limited to class and will be an open selection. Anybody with a strong ability will be selected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan nodded with satisfaction. This practice was truly reasonable or the lineup would be too rigid and some people would feel it was unfair. Freely releasing two quotas meant there everyone had a chance to compete freely.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any opinions?\u201d Chairman Nan asked Liu Chuan and Xiao Sijing.</p><br/><p>Xiao Sijing replied simply, \u201cI don\u2019t have any opinions. Captain Ling and Cat God definitely have the best understanding of Miracle. I am only acting as the referee with Liu Chuan. You can set the lineup.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan also smiled. \u201cYes, I think this is quite reasonable. The classes are averagely matched and the lineup is actually very comprehensive. It can respond to any opponents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan was pleased. \u201cOkay, it is decided!\u201d</p><br/><p>The league sent two great gods who knew e-sports, which was better than laymen telling them how to act.</p><br/><p>These two weren\u2019t interested in interfering with Miracle. As Xiao Sijing said, no one knew more about this game then Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>The lineup that the two people formulated was certainly the most reasonable and perfect one.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

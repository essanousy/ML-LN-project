He decided to go back to China and discuss with Liu Chuan about the next details.</p><br/><p>The club\u2019s headquarters was located in a large office building on the outskirts of Changsha. Once the two of them entered the door, they saw a row of cool and elegant cursive characters spelling out: Dragon Warriors E-sports Club.</p><br/><p>The font was flamboyant and it was said that Liu Chuan personally wrote it when he built his team.</p><br/><p>The large characters hung behind the front desk, next to the dragon totem logo of the club. The bright and large hall looked very stylish.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Warriors Club\u2019s manager, Liu Chuan was actually a rich second generation. His mother was a well known businesswoman and his family\u2019s assets were over 100 million yuan. The admirable thing was that he didn\u2019t rely on his family\u2019s financial support and earned a sum of money on his own. He used these funds to create this club by hand.</p><br/><p>The year that Li Cangyu\u2019s FTD team was disbanded happened to be the year that Liu Chuan created the Dragon Warriors Club. The two of them met while leveling in the game. Later, Liu Chuan led his team all the way to the finals to win the championship. Li Cangyu had transferred to Wulin but didn\u2019t get any good results.</p><br/><p>The Dragon Warriors Club developed extremely rapidly in just a few years. Its popularity rose steadily, causing advertisements, endorsements and sponsorships to roll in The club\u2019s decorations today looked very great.</p><br/><p>After retiring, Liu Chuan handed over the captain\u2019s position to Wu Zewen. Now he managed the club and was also an executive director in the China E-sports League. He also paid attention to the trends in the domestic and international e-sports circles. He always looked at the long-term and as soon as he heard about the Miracle World Competition, he took advantage of this opportunity to expand the scale of the Dragon Warriors Club into Miracle.</p><br/><p>The Canglan team disbanding at this time and Li Cangyu\u2019s joining was timely for LIu Chuan.</p><br/><p>There was no one better to lead a team in Miracle then Cat God!</p><br/><p>The cooperation between the two teams was very enjoyable. Liu Chuan handed over full responsibility of the team to Li Cangyu without disturbing him. This time, Li Cangyu wanted to handle the contracts for Xie Shurong and Zhang Jueming, as well as the development plan of the team. He wanted to have a good talk with Liu Chuan.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu greeted Liu Chuan on Q before leaving the house. Once the two people arrived at the club, the door opened for them. They walked towards the inner manager\u2019s office and Li Cangyu knocked on the door. A voice was heard from inside saying, \u201cCome in!\u201d</p><br/><p>The door opened to reveal a large desk in the middle of the spacious office. There was a high-end desktop computer as well as soft leather sofas with a coffee table next to it, clearly for guests. The right side had a large bookcase that occupied the wall. There weren\u2019t many books on it. Instead, there were boxes of arranged data and hundreds of CDs neatly placed.</p><br/><p>The man sitting at the desk looked young. He was wearing a simple short-sleeved shirt and slacks while smiling casually. Standing next to him was a man wearing glasses. The man wearing a white shirt, slim trousers and glasses looked more like a scholar than a e-sports player.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming had also heard of the two great gods of the Dragon Warriors Club. The one sitting at the desk should be the manager Liu Chuan and the \u2018academic\u2019 layer should be the current captain of the Wulin team, Wu Zewen, who was famous in the e-sports circle.</p><br/><p>\u201cSit down.\u201d Liu Chuan saw Li Cangyu enter end immediately stood up, bringing them to the sofa before asking, \u201cCat God, this is the Zhang Jueming you told me about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he promised to join the team so I brought him over to sign the contract.\u201d Li Cangyu explained.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming took the initiative to hold out his hand. \u201cIt is nice to meet you Boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan smiled and shook hands with him. \u201cCat God has told me about your situation. I have always respected old players. You won\u2019t regret coming back to help Cat God. You gave yourself a chance and this time we will directly rush towards the championship.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming laughed, \u201cI also think so!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZewen, take out the contract.\u201d Liu Chuan looked at the man beside him. Wu Zewen immediately found the contract and handed it to Zhang Jueming. He pushed up his glasses and said seriously, \u201cThis was just drawn up last night. If you aren\u2019t satisfied with any of the conditions then you can talk with the boss again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming carefully looked over the contract and found that his treatment was really good.</p><br/><p>The salary was twice as high as his studio and\u2026 in addition to the fixed salary, the players would get additional income such as competition bonuses, team advertising, tickets to matches and even profits from live programs!</p><br/><p>Many team managers wouldn\u2019t give the tickets and peripheral sales profits to the players. This was why Dragon Warriors was so popular.</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t satisfied with such conditions then he would be too picky.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming handed the contract back and said, \u201cNo problem. The conditions are much better than I thought!\u201d</p><br/><p>This man was straightforward and casually said the truth.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan replied, \u201cIf there\u2019s no problem then shall we sign the contract first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Zhang Jueming picked up a pen and signed his name on the contract.</p><br/><p>His writing was unrestrained, just like his nature.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan had a very good impression of Zhang Jueming. Compared to those who secretly acted behind the scenes, this type of person was best to get along with. Since this was a player recommended by Cat God, Liu Chuan was too lazy to ask about the level of this person. He believed in Cat God\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Once the contract was signed, Liu Chuan sat down with the two people on the sofas.</p><br/><p>Wu Zewen poured them two cups of water and handed them a thick data booklet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d The confused Li Cangyu opened the booklet.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan smiled and explained. \u201cZewen has been idle these days so he helped organize the information of the top eight teams in the Miracle League. Take a look first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Zewen, the captain of the Dragon Warriors team, had a science background. He had a lot of experience with organizing and summarizing data. Li Cangyu had a lot of contact with Wu Zewen many times while playing in the Wulin League and was very impressed with his ability to collect and analyze data.</p><br/><p>Today they belonged to the same club and because they were in different leagues, there was no conflict of interest. This type of data sharing would definitely be a great help to Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, the information compiled by the genius was different. It showed the information of all players in the top eight teams in great detail. Through some intuitive data, they could see the current status of many players.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu glanced over it. The most stable player in the sixth season was Ling Xuefeng, followed by Su Guangmo and Tan Shitian. They were the Three Pillars of today\u2019s Miracle League and captains of three major teams.</p><br/><p>The three great gods were ranked in the first echelon and the players in the second echelon weren\u2019t much weaker.</p><br/><p>For example, Wind Colour\u2019s vice-captain Yan Ruiwen was the strongest black magician in the league. Flying Feathers\u2019 vice-captain Yu Pingsheng was the strongest berserker. There was also Time\u2019s vice-captain Cheng Wei, Pure Cleansing\u2019s captain Zhu Qingyue, Ghost Spirits\u2019 Lou Zhang combination and so on\u2026 These players along could fight with Captain Ling, Captain Su and Captain Tan.</p><br/><p>The Miracle League had many clouds, showing that the overall strength of the first division had improved a lot compared to the first season of the league.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was very confident but he had to face so many strong opponents after returning to Miracle. The pressure on his shoulders wasn\u2019t small.</p><br/><p>After carefully reading the data, Li Cangyu said, \u201cLing Xuefeng and Su Guangmo are both old players who have played for several years. Tan Shitian just took over as captain last season and his performance is surprising. It seems that Captain Xu\u2019s vision is very great.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTan Shitian, I also know this person. He is the genius from the Huaxia Club\u2019s training camp. Once Xu Luo retired and Tan Shitian took over as the captain of Time, he is the most powerful one among the new generation of Miracle. Moreover, I watched the match between Wind Colour and Time last week. Xiao Cheng played slightly abnormally but Tan Shitian was able to hold on.\u201d Liu Chuan commented seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is indeed amazing.\u201d Li Cangyu said, \u201cI left Miracle when Xu Luo was still captain. Xu Luo\u2019s retirement didn\u2019t have the slightest effect on Time\u2019s result. This proves that Tan Shitian is equally excellent as captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we want to sweep through Miracle then Wind Colour, Flying Feathers and Time will be the hardest nuts to chew on?\u201d Zhang Jueming stated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe three teams have the strongest overall strength but the other teams aren\u2019t weak.\u201d Li Cangyu seriously analyzed, \u201cThere are eight giants of the Miracle League. Wind Colour depends on the dual summoner control and the black magician suppression, Time has the white magician control and the elf archer\u2019s remote outputs and Flying Feathers has the melee swordsmen. Then there is Pure Cleansing\u2019s psychic illusions, the Ghost Spirits Lou Zhang combination of the strongest assassins, the Cheetah team has their traps, Red Fox has multiple white magicians and Terminator is a combination of black and white magic. These teams each have their own characteristics.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu used a few simple words to point out the core lineup of the eight teams in the league. It was obvious that he also worked hard.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan looked at him with appreciation. \u201cWhat about Cat God?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cAt present, our team has a paladin, swordsman, healer, summoner and white magician auxiliary. There are five confirmed players. I would like to find a black magician, an assassin and a hunter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan summarized it. \u201cYou have a front row of defense, a back row of main attackers and an assassin and hunter for when it is necessary?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan used to be an e-sports player and he knew the game modes and lineup configurations very well. There were no obstacles when communicating and he was different from the bosses who acted arrogant despite knowing nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think this is the best choice.\u201d Li Cangyu explained, \u201cWhen I first started the new district, I didn\u2019t expect to meet Xie Shurong. His current strength isn\u2019t inferior to Su Guangmo and his joining made me change my thoughts. Xiao Gu is from the Dragon Warriors\u2019 training camp and his talent is very prominent. After some training, he could keep up with A\u2019Shu\u2019s rhythm. Our team\u2019s front row is guaranteed with those two. The biggest feature of A\u2019Shu is his fast burst of attacks so our team will take the fast attacking route.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is good. A strong offensive is actually a type of defense.\u201d Liu Chuan agreed. \u201cThe back row has you and Bai Xuan. The team\u2019s survivability and output will be guaranteed with your own partnership.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Li Cangyu was very confident about this. \u201cOld Zhang\u2019s white magic can also help us during a fierce battle. If used at the critical moment, our output will double and wouldn\u2019t be wasted. For the rest of them time, I will look for an assassin, hunter and black magician. I will switch them based on different opponents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming was amazed the more he heard. Cat God\u2019s tactical ability was truly deserving of his reputation!</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t even started playing in the league yet and he was already thinking about the team\u2019s lineup. It was really farsighted.</p><br/><p>As he said, Xie Shurong and Xiao Gu being the melee front row and Cat God and Bai Xuan\u2019s being in the rear meant the team\u2019s defense, survival and output was basically guaranteed. If mobile hunter and assassins were found then there would be a greater impact on the team. As for the black magician\u2026 it should be to control the white magicians of Time and Red Fox?</p><br/><p>He was too thoughtful and came up with a professional configuration that targeted the eight strong teams of the league. They had a chance to win and not by crushed by a team\u2019s lineup.</p><br/><p>It was wise of him to follow such a captain!</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming clenched his fist with excitement.</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan handed the Miracle team to Li Cangyu so he naturally didn\u2019t have any doubts about Li Cangyu\u2019s decision. He thought up to here and said, \u201cI think this type of combination is good. The specific members configuration will be left up to you. If you can\u2019t find good teammates in the game and need to dig someone out from another team, we will discuss it later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had just entered the only game when he met A\u2019Shu, followed by Old Zhang. Five players were decided in less than a month. This speed was really amazing. Liu Chuan was very pleased with the progress of Li Cangyu\u2019s team and smiled. \u201cPerhaps your luck has arrived? This world competition might be waiting for Cat God to show your power!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu also laughed. \u201cPerhaps the world competition blew out a lot of masters into the public. Miracle\u2019s new district is very lively and I could meet A\u2019Shu and Old Zhang. My luck is also very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan stood up and said, \u201cI\u2019ll show you around the club first before inviting you out to dinner. I must welcome Zhang Jueming to the Dragon Warriors Club.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming replied, \u201cBoss is too polite!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Chuan smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome, there is no need to be too polite. What do you want to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at Zhang Jueming and said seriously, \u201cLet\u2019s go eat boiled fish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Couldn\u2019t he eat anything else?</p><br/><p>However, Zhang Jueming could only bite the bullet after seeing Cat God\u2019s eyes. \u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

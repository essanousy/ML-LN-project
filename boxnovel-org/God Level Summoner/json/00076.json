In the third game, the host selected a few lucky viewers to go on stage to play with the great gods, causing the atmosphere to become bustling.</p><br/><p>At 12, the Carnival was paused as they entered the lunch break</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei immediately ran towards Li Cangyu. \u201cCat God, I will invite you to eat lunch!\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned and found Vice-Captain Bai was also present. Cheng Wei smiled and greeted him. \u201cVice-Captain Bai, long time no see!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled and said, \u201cYes, you have become taller!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Vice-Captain Bai also looks good.\u201d Cheng Wei was very happy.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, he found a person with black eyes and blond hair following behind Bai Xuan. Cheng Wei looked at him curiously before thinking he was a random and ignoring him. Then Xiao Han went to Li Cangyu and asked, \u201cMaster, where are we going for lunch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei immediately stared in shock. \u201cWhat did you call him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han repeated, \u201cMaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan explained, \u201cThis is the apprentice that Cat God just accepted.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Cheng Wei stared bitterly at Xiao Han, his cheeks puffing up.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled, \u201cYou look just like a great god!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Cheng Wei clung to Cat God\u2019s arm. \u201cI also want to worship, I also want to worship! Why did you accept him as an apprentice and not me?\u201d He stared at Xiao Han while speaking.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was killed by Cheng Wei\u2019s gaze and looked at Li Cangyu in a daze.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was entertained on the side. It was like a cat with his fur sticking up and a Persian cat fighting for a handsome black cat. Cat God\u2019s body seemed to have a magnetic field that attracted young people. The young people in the league were all his fans.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu helplessly rubbed his temples and looked at Cheng Wei. \u201cYou are the vice-captain of the Time team, shouldn\u2019t you be more mature?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei lowered his head in a depressed manner and Li Cangyu rubbed his ears. \u201cBe obedient. In my heart, you are like my little brother and your current identity isn\u2019t suitable for acknowledging me as a master. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Brother? Didn\u2019t this seem more intimate than apprentice?</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s eyes brightened and he nodded with satisfaction. \u201cYes! Then he should call me Uncle.\u201d Cheng Wei looked back at Xiao Han and raised his chin. \u201cSince you are a younger generation, I won\u2019t care about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014The first round of competition, Cheng Wei won.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was still in a curious and dazed state because he wasn\u2019t clear about the relationship between his master and this person.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei wanted to have lunch together. As a result, Bai Xuan said, \u201cThe Carnival has just stopped so the restaurants nearby will definitely be crowded. It is better to go home and eat. I will cook a few dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu agreed while Cheng Wei had no opinion and naturally followed them.</p><br/><p>Once everyone arrived at home, Bai Xuan went to cook while Uncle Zhang helped him. Xiao Han and Xiao Gu ran to the living room to play a boxing game. Cheng Wei was at Li Cangyu\u2019s side and constantly asking him questions. \u201cWho is Xiao Han? What about Xiao Gu? Are they all members of your team?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYes, I only have six members on my team at the moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are only five here. Is there one more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXie Shurong. He is with the ICE team today and it isn\u2019t convenient for him to come over. He will return home with me when his contract expires at the end of the year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2019Shu?\u201d Cheng Wei was stunned. As one of the two strongest players who debuted in the third season, Cheng Wei was naturally familiar with Xie Shurong. He didn\u2019t expect A\u2019Shu to join Cat God\u2019s team and was very happy for Li Cangyu. \u201cIf he is there, your team will definitely be excellent!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu sighed, \u201cMy luck this time is really good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was silent for a moment before suddenly saying, \u201cCat God, in fact, I\u2026 I signed a contract with the Time team for only three years. This year happens to be the sixth season and my contract will expire at the end of the year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu knew what he wanted to say but pretended not to know. He turned back and asked, \u201cSo what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei whispered, \u201cIf I move to your team, will you accept me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied decisively. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng raised his head in surprise. \u201cWhy? Is my level worse than Xie Shurong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu helplessly patted Cheng Wei\u2019s head. \u201cBoth of you have contracts expiring at the end of the year but your situation is different from A\u2019shu. How old are you? Don\u2019t be so impulsive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not being impulsive. I\u2019m serious.\u201d Cheng Wei looked seriously at Li Cangyu. \u201cIsn\u2019t your team still missing people? Moreover, my contract with Time is expiring. I am free to leave so I will talk to Manager Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Tan Shitian?\u201d Li Cangyu asked.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei scratched his head and said, \u201cHe signed a five year contract with Time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean, what will he do when you\u2019re gone?\u201d Li Cangyu looked seriously at Cheng Wei. \u201cTan Shitian became the captain of Time shortly after he debuted. He was a newcomer who took over as captain and guaranteed that Time\u2019s performance didn\u2019t decline. You definitely didn\u2019t care about the team\u2019s matters. How you thought about how hard it was for Captain Tan to lead the team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Cheng Wei was stunned and couldn\u2019t speak for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did I choose to take my brothers to Wulin instead of joining another team alone? It is because I have responsibility as a captain. As a captain, I have to handle that responsibility. But you, as vice-captain, actually say that you want to leave. Completely ignoring your teammates, do you have any sense of responsibility in your heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s voice was so serious and powerful that he couldn\u2019t refute it.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheng Wei, when Xu Luo left, he didn\u2019t give the captain\u2019s position to you because you are impulsive and never consider problems from the perspective of others. You are 19 years old, not a 16 year old emotional child. I can understand that you are grateful to me for guiding you but don\u2019t forget that the Time team is the place that raised you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at Cheng Wei and declared, \u201cWithout the Time team, you wouldn\u2019t be able to rise to the peak. Now you are going to abandon them when you are famous. What will the fans of the Time team think of you? What would your teammates say? What would Tan Shitian think of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Cheng Wei lowered his head and didn\u2019t speak, his eyes red.</p><br/><p>He saw the little guy hanging his head with a pathetic look and couldn\u2019t help softening his heart. \u201cI am saying this for your own good. Xiao Wei, it is time for you to grow up. The thing I want to see most is for you to become a good vice-captain, not following me to my team. Once your strength becomes equal to mine one day, it will prove that I wasn\u2019t wrong in bothering to teach you that year. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I understand.\u201d Cheng Wei nodded.</p><br/><p>Cat God was right. He was really too impulsive. He could leave the team after the contract expired but if he left Time now, they would be in great trouble without a successor to the white magician.</p><br/><p>He had never considered the situation from Tan Shitian\u2019s perspective. He always felt that the smiling Tan Shitian wasn\u2019t serious and wasn\u2019t as good a captain as Cat God and Captain Xu\u2026</p><br/><p>Today he was taught a lesson by Cat God and instantly sobered up.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for Tan Shitian, maybe the Time team would\u2019ve already fallen!</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t he think about it? After the new captain took over the team, it was necessary to handle the relationship between players. He needed to ensure that the team members listened to his commands, ensure that the team\u2019s performance didn\u2019t decline, draw fans to the team and cope with the media\u2026. Cheng Wei didn\u2019t do anything as the vice-captain so Tan Shitian must be very tired, right? If it wasn\u2019t for Tan Shitian\u2019s abilities, the Time team would\u2019ve been squeezed out of the ranks of the giants.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was sad and embarrassed when he thought of this. He even felt disgraced in front of Cat God.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026I was wrong\u2026\u201d Cheng Wei whispered, \u201cI will go back and renew my contract. I want to be a good vice-captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cXiao Wei, your goal should be to surpass the big gods in the alliance. You are only 19 years old and can play for several years. Your future is boundless. You should put your vision a bit higher, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei nodded hard. \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that Cat God was really good to him because who didn\u2019t want him as a teammate? Moreover, Cat God\u2019s team was now lacking people. If he joined, he would definitely be a big help to Cat God.</p><br/><p>However, Cat God decisively refused in consideration for Cheng Wei\u2019s future\u2026</p><br/><p>This was really seeing him as a younger brother!</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was moved by Li Cangyu and said seriously, \u201cThank you Cat God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and rubbed his head. \u201cI just want you to understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After eating lunch and returning to the hotel, Cheng Wei swiped his card at his room door. As soon as he entered, Tan Shitian nervously pulled him over. \u201cWhere have you been? I called your phone and didn\u2019t get through. I thought you were lost! Did you eat? I bought you takeaway. Would you like to heat it up and eat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei couldn\u2019t help feeling bitter when he saw Tan Shitian\u2019s concerned eyes and hugged him tightly. \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian became slightly stiff as he was smothered by the little guy. He found that Cheng Wei\u2019s eyes were red and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei buried his head in Tan Shitian\u2019s chest and spoke in an embarrassed manner. \u201cI was wrong\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Tan Shitian was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei whispered, \u201cI saw Cat God today and went to lunch with him. I told him that\u2026 my contract with Time is soon expiring and I want to join his team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian frowned.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s head hung lower. \u201cI ended up being scolded by Cat God. I have figured things out so once we return home, I will renew my contract with Time for another three years, just like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian was relieved when he heard this. Cat God really killed Cheng Wei\u2019s impulsive idea!</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei went on to say, \u201cI was being too willful and never thought of your feelings. I\u2019m sorry. I am probably the most unqualified vice-captain in the league. Later\u2026I will help you out. If you aren\u2019t busy, please teach me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian still didn\u2019t talk.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei looked up at him. \u201cAre you angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian couldn\u2019t help smiling at the sight of the wet eyes and gently pinched Cheng Wei\u2019s face. \u201cDid you cry after being scolded by Cat God?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t cry. I\u2019m not crybaby Zhu Qingyue.\u201d Cheng Wei looked embarrassed. \u201cI just\u2026 felt sad\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian helplessly sighed in the bottom of his heart. He guessed that Li Cangyu\u2019s scolding of Cheng Wei wasn\u2019t light. The big cat was an elder to the kitten. The kitten did wrong so the big cat should scold him.</p><br/><p>He wanted to leave Time? Tan Shitian would scold him all day!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian saw Cheng Wei\u2019s guilt, remorse and red eyes and couldn\u2019t help softening. He extended his arms, gently hugged Cheng Wei and said softly, \u201cOkay, don\u2019t be sad. It is good that you are willing to stay in Time.\u201d</p><br/><p>He never realized before that Tan Shitian\u2019s embrace was so forgiving and warm.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei remembered the past and felt ashamed. He buried his head and declared seriously, \u201cCaptain Tan, after this, I will help you manage the Time team together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Tan Shitian smiled and held this little fellow tightly.</p><br/><p>In fact, Tan Shitian didn\u2019t need a strong vice-captain. His ability alone was enough to manage the affairs of the team. Cheng Wei was emotional, silly, had a simple heart and was impulsive\u2026</p><br/><p>However, it was this simple and straightforward teenager that attracted Tan Shitian\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Bullying him, making him angry, looking at his hair that stood up\u2026 but also wanting to take care of him, protect him and hug him.</p><br/><p>It seemed that Cat God\u2019s lecture was lethal, making Cheng Wei completely wake up. It was surprising that Cheng Wei said he would actually help manage the team.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Cheng Wei took the initiative to hug Tan Shitian. The person in his arms was soft and the furry head was buried in Tan Shitian\u2019s chest, making Cheng Wei seem like a cat.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian was extremely happy at the thought of him and Cheng Wei fighting together in the league in the future!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

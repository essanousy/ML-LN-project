However, the two players had a tacit understanding for many years. Despite being separated by a reef, they could accurately match each other to hit Hwa Jeongyong\u2019s body</p><br/><p>The South Korean team still had three people left. This number might be smaller than the Chinese team but they were in good shape with their blood above 70%. Park Joonseo was controlled by Xiao Han and Qin Mo and couldn\u2019t summon pets for the time being. Kim Yoonhee made a quick decision, \u201cKill the assassin first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s interruption of Park Joonseo was indeed troublesome and the blood kin assassin\u2019s attacks could suck up blood. In the blink of an eye, the originally residual blood Xiao Han was restored to 35% blood. Kim Yoonhee decisively used Quenching Arrow to freeze Xiao Han.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo summoned the blood spider and blood snake to quickly bit the three Korean players. All three of them had three layers of bleeding and then Qin Mo summoned the death knight. Kim Yoonhee fired Seize Life Shot at Xiao Han only to be blocked by Qin Mo\u2019s death knight!</p><br/><p>The domestic live broadcast room was instantly filled with: [Little Prince 6666!] [Qin Mo is literally 6!]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s life was saved in a thrilling manner and he continued to hit Park Joonseo, using Death Strangulation!</p><br/><p>The big move allowed his blood to be restored to 45% while Park Joonseo fell to 60%. Kim Yoonhee felt a bit anxious and fired two arrows to kill the blood kin summoner\u2019s knight. She then accurately fired Barrage Shot to kill the blood Qin Mo!</p><br/><p>The score became 5:4 with South Korea in the lead.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s heart was touched after seeing that Qin Mo was killed. In today\u2019s group battle, Qin Mo had helped him many times. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have lived to the present. Since QIn Mo sacrificed his life, Xiao Han wouldn\u2019t let him down!</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s eyes became cold as he thought of this and he used Back Stab and Fatal Blow on Kim Yoonhee.</p><br/><p>Park Joonseo was greatly affected by the assassin. In desperation, he had to summon the public pet, the guardian to offset the damage. Then he quickly retreated behind a reef and took the opportunity to summon the ice woman!</p><br/><p>His snow bird, light god and six-winged angel had been killed by Qin Xiao and he only had the ice woman left.</p><br/><p>After successfully summoning the pet, he had her used the big move, Soul of Ice!</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was frozen in place and couldn\u2019t move. Kim Yoonhee took the opportunity to decrease his blood.</p><br/><p>However, the white magician Hwa Jeongyong wasn\u2019t in a very good state. Under the siege of Tan Cheng, she only had a bit of blood left. It didn\u2019t take look for Hwa Jeongyong to be killed by Tan Shitian\u2019s Seize Life Shot.</p><br/><p>At almost the same time, Xiao Han was killed by Kim Yoonhee and Park Joonseo.</p><br/><p>The score became 6:5 with South Korea in the lead.</p><br/><p>The Chinese team only had Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei while the South Korean team had Park Joonseo and Kim Yoonhee. Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei only had 15% blood left while Park Joonseo still had 60% blood. Fortunately, Xiao Han had released a last minute outbreak and forced Kim Yoonhee to residual blood.</p><br/><p>In a situation where they weren\u2019t dominant, Tan Shitian calmly thought about it and ordered, \u201cXiao Wei, cover me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Cheng Wei took the initiative to walk in front of Tan Shitian.</p><br/><p>Kim Yoonhee\u2019s Shock Shot had just hit Cheng Wei who stood in front of him. It was equivalent to Cheng Wei using his body to help Tan Shitian block the move.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian used the opportunity to use Quenching Arrow! Seize Life Shot!</p><br/><p>From a god\u2019s perspective, Tan Shitian\u2019s angle of the shot was blocked by Cheng Wei. The surprising thing was that Cheng Wei suddenly moved to the left, allowing Tan Shitian\u2019s arrows to just fly past his body!</p><br/><p>Kim Yoonhee had her vision obstructed and couldn\u2019t defend herself. She was frozen in place and then hit by Seize Life Shot. Her blood instantly fell to a precarious state!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian followed with Barrage Shot!</p><br/><p>Just then, Park Joonseo\u2019s ice woman suddenly used a big move, World of Ice and Snow.</p><br/><p>In addition to the group control of Soul of Ice, the ice woman had the World of Ice and Snow group attack. This was the only attack skill of the angel summoner and consumed a lot of blue.</p><br/><p>However, death racing was about speed and this skill was really critical.</p><br/><p>The group attack directly killed the Tan Cheng pair!</p><br/><p>At almost the same time, Kim Yoonhee was hit by Tan Shitian\u2019s arrow and died.</p><br/><p>The heads on the big screen changed to 8:6!</p><br/><p>The fierce frontal battle was finally over. All five Chinese players were killed while the South Korean team had the captain Park Joonseo survive. South Korea was ahead by one head at the start and now they led by two heads after this wave.</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi was nervous. \u201cThe Chinese players must find a way to play in the next wave or the South Korea team just needs to take two heads to win!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian saw this and ordered, \u201cGather at the resurrection point!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a benefit to all five people dying. They could quickly gather for a team battle while South Korea\u2019s Park Joonseo wasn\u2019t dead and had to walk back to meet up with his teammates.</p><br/><p>Walking wasn\u2019t as fast as resurrection and they had to grasp this time difference.</p><br/><p>The time of resurrection after the second death was 10 seconds.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei waited for 10 seconds to pass and then quickly rushed to the red resurrection point with their teammates.</p><br/><p>Due to familiarity with the map, Tan Shitian led the team through shortcuts and deliberately avoided the position of the previous group battle to avoid meeting Park Joonseo.</p><br/><p>They quickly came to the red resurrection point and saw the four members of the Korean team.</p><br/><p>\u201cSet fire to the swordsman!\u201d Tan Shitian unceremoniously aimed Quenching Arrow at Shim Yoocheol. Cheng Wei, Zhuo Hang, Qin Mo and Xiao Han closely followed. The South Korea team apparently hadn\u2019t expected the Chinese team to come over so fast. They were waiting for their captain only to be hit by China!</p><br/><p>The newly resurrected Shim Yoocheol was directly killed by the joint efforts of the five people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shim Yoocheol, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His luck was so bad. It must be because he didn\u2019t eat cold noodles for breakfast this morning.</p><br/><p>Still, it was enough to see how powerful China\u2019s five outputs were.</p><br/><p>Since the captain was absent, Kim Yoonhee immediately acted as commander. \u201cQuickly kill the hunter! We will win if we take two heads!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her brother Kim Yoonhee lurked behind Zhuo Hang and used Pain Blade to control Zhuo Hang. Kim Yoonhee followed with Seize Life Shot and Hwa Jeongyong wasn\u2019t far behind with God\u2019s Light and Voice of Combat!</p><br/><p>South Korea\u2019s three outputs teaming up to kill Zhuo Hang was naturally slower than the time it took China\u2019s five outputs.</p><br/><p>By the time Zhuo Hang died, the three of them were beaten to half blood by Tan Shitian and the others.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the South Korean team already had nine heads. They just needed to kill one more person and they would directly gain victory.</p><br/><p>Which one should they kill? She was hesitating when the captain\u2019s low voice was heard in her ears. \u201cKill the white magician.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Yoonhee exclaimed, \u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Chinese side had harvested seven heads. They just needed to kill everyone here to win.</p><br/><p>The situation reached the critical moment and Tan Shitian clenched his mouse. \u201cOpen your group attacks!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was obviously too late to kill them one by one. It was only by opening the big moves that they could quickly kill the three opponents. They immediately used group attacks according to his orders but the three South Korean players weren\u2019t outdone. They threw their most explosive moves towards only one individual. In the blink of an eye, Cheng Wei fell to 15% blood!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian ordered, \u201cXiao Wei, quickly withdraw!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei instantly turned to run. As the last head, he couldn\u2019t let the Korean team get it for a cheap price!</p><br/><p>The assassin saw him escape and didn\u2019t hesitate to chase him!</p><br/><p>Qin Mo and Xiao Han continued to attack and Kim Yoonhee and Hwa Jeongyong were hit to residual blood. Tan Shitian clenched his mouse and shook it slightly. His Barrage Shot was released and the group attack allowed him to take two kills in one breath!</p><br/><p>The Chinese team got nine heads and it was time to finally decide the outcome.</p><br/><p>However, at this critical moment, Cheng Wei had fled the resurrection point to the east and was unlucky enough to meet Park Joonseo, who came from the distance. The South Korean captain instantly made a mark on the map and blocked the narrow road so Cheng Wei couldn\u2019t go forward. The assassin chasing Cheng Wei found him thanks to the captain\u2019s mark.</p><br/><p>\u2014Fatal Blow!</p><br/><p>The assassin\u2019s most commonly used single attack skill was released and Cheng Wei fell helplessly.</p><br/><p>The South Korean team took the lead in gaining 10 heads.</p><br/><p>The word \u2018Failure\u2019 popped up on the big screen. This was the first time the Chinese team had seen it in the World Competition.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei hung his head and his expression looked like he was going to cry. Tan Shitian was very calm as he moved his hands away from the keyboard and patted Cheng Wei\u2019s head. \u201cThis isn\u2019t your fault. Our luck this time wasn\u2019t very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei still wasn\u2019t happy. After all, he was the last head for the South Korean team. If he had just ran in the other direction or got rid of the assassin, the end result would be different.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, there were no \u2018ifs\u2019 on the field.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei stared at the computer screen in front of him and muttered, \u201cThe domestic audience must be scolding me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian helped tidy up his hair and spoke softly, \u201cDon\u2019t mind it. No matter how strong a player, they will all lose eventually. I was the commander of the game and it was also my order for you to retreat. I bear the responsibility.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was gentle but contained decisiveness and determination. It was as if there was nothing to fear with him there.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei saw the encouraging gaze and couldn\u2019t help feeling moved.</p><br/><p>He used to think that the always smiling Tan Shitian was never serious and always bickered with him.</p><br/><p>Then today in the World Competition, Cat God sent Tan Shitian out to open the match. As the youngest captain in the professional league, Tan Shitian withstood the huge pressure and achieved a score of 9:10 against the South Korean team, which wasn\u2019t easy.</p><br/><p>This man was more powerful than Cheng Wei thought.</p><br/><p>At a young age, he could face winning and losing in the World Competition so easily. Despite going against South Korea\u2019s ace captain, Park Joonseo, his mental state was steady and he calmly commanded the game. This alone was enough to make Cheng Wei feel ashamed.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei couldn\u2019t help admiring such a Tan Shitian. Cheng Wei might feel that Tan Shitian didn\u2019t seem reliable but Tan Shitian was particularly responsible in critical moments.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei returned with the rest of his teammates and Li Cangyu didn\u2019t blame them. Instead, he smiled and said, \u201cYou did a lot better than I expected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled with some regret. \u201cUnfortunately, I lost in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Li Cangyu patted him on the shoulder and encouraged him. \u201cIt is good to fight 9:10 with so many newcomers. Your strength is obvious.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian nodded. \u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu gathered the players and spoke simple, \u201cWe don\u2019t need to mind the first game. Adjust your mentality and prepare for the next game. A good show is still ahead!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

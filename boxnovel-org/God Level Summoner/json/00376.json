The side character in the game waved the giant sword in his hand, made a handsome turn and successfully slashed at the bloody opponent. The opponent fell to the ground and Su Guangmo placed the cigarette in his mouth in the ashtray on the table. He was heading to the kitchen for food when he heard a knock on the door.</p><br/><p>He opened the door and saw Captain Song Yang standing at the door. Su Guangmo respectfully spoke, \u201cMaster, you were looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Yang was the one who found his talent and was someone Su Guangmo greatly respected. When he was young, he was too arrogant and his first interview with the Flying Feathers team wasn\u2019t smooth. Fortunately, Song Yang saw his talent and accepted him as an apprentice on the spot.</p><br/><p>After training in the Flying Feathers team for two months, Su Guangmo\u2019s current level could compete with the team\u2019s first-tier players. Song Yang had decided to let him go out next season. Recently, Flying Feathers had been busy with their matches and Song Yang hadn\u2019t found him for a long time. That\u2019s why Su Guangmo was very surprised by Song Yang appearing at the door of his dormitory today.</p><br/><p>The even more surprising thing was Song Yang\u2019s words. \u201cI have received another apprentice today and brought him to meet him. He is Yu Pingsheng and he will later be your younger apprentice brother. I am usually busy and you should take care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo looked around Song Yang in a confused manner. \u201cYounger brother? Where?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHere.\u201d There was a weak voice from behind Song Yang and Yu Pingsheng emerged. Su Guangmo discovered that this person was relatively short and thin. The tall and strong Song Yang completely blocked his body.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo bowed his head and examined this person carefully. He unexpectedly found that this younger brother was actually very good-looking. The youth\u2019s appearance was delicate and his black eyes were bright. His age wasn\u2019t obvious and his face was full of tenderness and innocence. He seemed a bit shy at Su Guangmo\u2019s gaze and hid behind their master again, not letting Su Guangmo see him anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, my younger brother also has stealth skills.\u201d Su Guangmo joked. \u201cWhy is he gone again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng\u2019s face was extremely red but Song Yang just smiled. \u201cXiao Yu\u2019s personality isn\u2019t like you. He is awkward and isn\u2019t fond of talking to people. I have arranged for him to live with you. After becoming brothers, you have to take care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. Master, you can rest assured!\u201d Su Guangmo patted his chest and promised.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will go first. Flying Feathers has a match in a few days and I have to prepare the tactical arrangement. I will hold a meeting in the conference room at 8:30 in the morning. You two, come and sit in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes Master, go first if you\u2019re busy!\u201d He bid farewell to his master and Su Guangmo couldn\u2019t help laughing as he gazed at the dazed teenager in front of him. \u201cYounger Brother, come in. You will live next door to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He enthusiastically helped Yu Pingsheng bring his suitcase in. He didn\u2019t notice that Yu Pingsheng had a stiff back and pale face when he approached.</p><br/><p>At that time, Su Guangmo didn\u2019t know that Yu Pingsheng was someone with a communication disorder and it was a very serious psychological problem. He simply thought that Yu Pingsheng\u2019s personality was more introverted.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo had always been bold and this person was brought over by Master Song Yang. He soon regarded Yu Pingsheng as a good buddy. After all, he would be teammates with Yu Pingsheng and teammates should be in harmony. How could they play the game if they were fighting?</p><br/><p>At this time, Su Guangmo had a young man\u2019s heart. His way of being good to people was simple. He helped Yu Pingsheng place the suitcase in the bedroom and carefully washed a plate of fruit. He peeled an orange and handed it to Yu Pingsheng. \u201cCome, eat an orange first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng gazed at the orange in front of him, face red with embarrassment. It was like he was being forced to take medicine. After a while, he stiffly reached for the orange and gently placed it on the table. \u201cThank you, I will eat it later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was stunned. This expression obviously showed Yu Pingsheng disliked it?</p><br/><p>He kindly gave fruit to the other person only to have cold water poured on his head. Su Guangmo had a straightforward personality. He was somewhat unhappy and frowned, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it then don\u2019t eat. Don\u2019t force yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t dislike it.\u201d Yu Pingsheng explained shyly. He placed a peeled orange into his mouth and slowly chewed, his expression truly showing what it meant by \u2018chewing wax.\u2019 Su Guangmo laughed at the sight. He suddenly felt that this person was quite interesting. Eating an orange was like tasting medicine. Yu Pingsheng obviously didn\u2019t like it but he still ate it silently.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng ate the orange for a full 10 minutes. Su Guangmo sat there and appreciated his expression. After finishing, Su Guangmo wondered with a funny smile, \u201cIs it delicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, very delicious.\u201d Yu Pingsheng gave a grudging smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019ll peel another one for you.\u201d Yu Pingsheng saw Su Guangmo about to peel the orange again and immediately became pale. His expression looked like Su Guangmo was giving him poison.</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cBrother, you are too interesting, hahaha! If you don\u2019t want to eat then don\u2019t eat. I won\u2019t force you. Why are you making that expression? Hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out he was being deliberately teased. Yu Pingsheng\u2019s face was slightly red as he whispered, \u201cI-I\u2019m not very talkative.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo smiled and patted his younger brother\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. E-sports players don\u2019t need to say much. It is enough if you play well. Let\u2019s go, I will take you to visit the Flying Feathers team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng had a psychological problem but Su Guangmo\u2019s enthusiasm made him unable to refuse. He had to stiffly follow behind Su Guangmo as he was introduced to the environment of the Flying Feathers team.</p><br/><p>The conditions of the Flying Feathers team wasn\u2019t bad. There was a spacious and bright training room with two rows of computers side by side. Su Guangmo took Yu Pingsheng to the second row and explained, \u201cThis is the area for us newcomers. We usually just do training. The front row is for the main players and we shouldn\u2019t bother them. They are preparing for the competition recently and their pressure is quite big. You will sit at the computer next to me and just ask if you have any questions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng nodded and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo took him next door. \u201cThis is the conference room which can accommodate more than 20 people. Master\u2019s usual tactical discussion meetings are held here. Tomorrow morning, everyone will meet here at 8:30 to discuss the next match. When you come to listen to the tactical arrangement, it is best to prepare a book to write down some of Master\u2019s key contents. If you go back and think about it, this will help your tactical awareness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng nodded again. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo smiled at him. \u201cAre you only going to say yes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng\u2019s eyes were a bit uneasy and he hung his head like he made a mistake. \u201cI-I\u2019m not very talk\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was helpless. \u201cOkay, I know. Then keep saying \u2018yes\u2019 if you understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Who was this? Even a three year old child didn\u2019t find it so hard to express themselves?</p><br/><p>Su Guangmo was dutifully doing his duty as the Flying Feathers guide. The result was that Yu Pingsheng finally only said \u2018Yes\u2019 after a long time, making Su Guangmo really anxious for him. However, he saw the uneasy Yu Pingsheng look like a small animal lost in the forest and Su Guangmo\u2019s heart softened. He couldn\u2019t bear to force Yu Pingsheng to continue and took him to the dining room.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After going around the Flying Feathers team once, Su Guangmo drew a floor plan for his younger brother and then took him back to the dormitory, also teaching him how to use the hot water in the bathroom.</p><br/><p>From beginning to end, Yu Pingsheng only spoke a few words like \u2018yes\u2019, \u2018okay\u2019, \u2018thank you.\u2019 His longest sentence was \u2018I\u2019m not very talkative\u2019. Su Guangmo resisted the urge to laugh and arranged everything for him before turning back to the bedroom.</p><br/><p>In fact, Yu Pingsheng wasn\u2019t \u2018not talkative\u2019. He found it \u2018repulsive\u2019 to talk to people.</p><br/><p>He had been diagnosed with autism as a child. Three-quarters of children with autism had an intellectual disability but Yu Pingsheng belonged to the one-quarter that was very smart. However, he wasn\u2019t interested in any toys and rarely looked at people, let alone communicate with them.</p><br/><p>After his parents noticed the abnormality, the three year old Yu Pingsheng was taken to the hospital. The doctor diagnosed him with autism. After a period of treatment, his situation improved but the long-term lack of communication couldn\u2019t be reversed. Even in his teens, he still liked to be alone.</p><br/><p>He never had a friend since he was a child. Every time he communicated with others, he felt it was particularly difficult. If someone other than his parents approached him, he would be stiff and frightened.</p><br/><p>From a young age, his best friend was the computer.</p><br/><p>Last year, he started playing Miracle by chance. He didn\u2019t need to communicate with people so he gained more and more energy from the game. His level leapt by a huge amount. Unexpectedly, he met the president of the Flying Feathers Guild in an instance of the online game. The president discovered his talent and invited him to the Flying Feathers team as an e-sports player.</p><br/><p>He was afraid to accept this invitation. How could he communicate with his teammates? How could he play a team game?</p><br/><p>Then his parents learnt about it and hoped he would try it. His mother gently told him that he couldn\u2019t go on like this. Parents would always leave first and once that happened, he would be left alone. Did he want to die alone?</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng knew that his mother\u2019s words were very reasonable and raised the courage to come to the Flying Feathers team.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Captain Song Yang had a good temper and could accommodate any player with a flawed personality as long as their level was sufficient.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng\u2019s level of playing the game was very high and he soon gained Song Yang\u2019s appreciation. Song Yang accepted him as an apprentice and handed him over to his fellow apprentice brother, Su Guangmo.</p><br/><p>Unlike Yu Pingsheng\u2019s introverted self, Su Guangmo was straightforward and heart. He might not be very old but he had a man\u2019s pride. Despite the stiff Yu Pingsheng, Su Guangmo took good care of him, taking him around the entire Flying Feathers team and settling him properly.</p><br/><p>Yu Pingsheng lay on his bed after showering. His mother sent him a message asking about the team. Yu Pingsheng considered it for a long time before finally writing seriously, \u201cI have an apprentice brother called Su Guangmo. He is a very good person.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He called from the hotel lobby to have Xie Shurong come down. The next moment, a young man strode over while wearing the blue shirt picked by Bai Xuan along with beige slim trousers. The light-coloured clothes emphasized his body wand there was a bright smile on his face.</p><br/><p>Despite being familiar with this person, Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help staring. Xie Shurong was really handsome when dressed up. His facial features were handsome and three-dimensional and he looked young and open. This look was completely in line with the protagonist of an idol drama.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan stood in place and watched Xie Shurong walking towards him. Somehow, his heartbeat suddenly accelerated. Before he could react, Xie Shurong hugged him and rubbed his chin against Bai Xuan\u2019s head like a baby. \u201cI missed you and dreamt of you last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d He was hugged in public and Bai Xuan\u2019s cheeks turned hot. He gently pushed this person away and said, \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble. My mother made lunch so go to my house to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood. Then come upstairs with me to get something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d The puzzled Bai Xuan followed only to hear, \u201cI naturally have to buy gifts for my future parents!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people arrived at the room and opened the door. Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help frowning. Xie Shurong, this lazy worm, he got up in the morning and didn\u2019t even arrange his quilt. His bed was a mess and there were several trousers piled up. It was obvious he had woken up early to match them with the shirt.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan helplessly walked into the room. \u201cWhy is it so messy?\u201d</p><br/><p>He moved to the bed and helped Xie Shurong clean it up. In the blink of an eye, the quilt was neatly laid and the trousers were stacked one by one in the suitcase. Within five minutes, the room had completely changed.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong looked over, gentleness almost overflowing from his eyes. Bai Xuan turned his head and met Xie Shurong\u2019s gentle gaze. His heart jumped and he looked around with embarrassment. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are particularly handsome.\u201d Xie Shurong walked over with a smile and hugged Bai Xuan\u2019s waist in a spoiled manner. \u201cLooking at you cleaning up and helping me stack my clothes, I suddenly think that we\u2019re like newlyweds\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is married to you?\u201d Bai Xuan was furious and regretted helping this lazy worm fold his clothes. Then Xie Shurong suddenly turned and trapped Bai Xuan between the wall and himself. He bent his head and kissed Bai Xuan, blocking all words of rebuttal.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan was caught off guard and tried to push this person away, only to have his hands grabbed.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t look at Xie Shurong\u2019s usual grinning self who wasn\u2019t serious. His strength was surprisingly and Bai Xuan was trapped by him. He was pressed to the wall and crushed by Xie Shurong\u2019s pressure.</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s tongue passionately licked every corner of his mouth, leaving only warmth behind. Bai Xuan was breathless and his heart beat more fiercely.</p><br/><p>His mouth was licked by the other side\u2019s tongue and the sensations passed along his sensitive peripheral nerves to his brain. Bai Xuan gradually gave up struggling and actively hugged Xie Shurong\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026 mmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The kiss was gentle and sweet. By the time Xie Shurong stopped, Bai Xuan\u2019s entire face was red as his lips opened and he gasped.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled and licked the liquid on his lips before whispering in Bai Xuan\u2019s ears. \u201cHow does it feel to be pressed against the wall by your boyfriend? This is how it is played in TV series. If you like it then we can try many poses later?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan glared at him. \u201cEnough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was shameless as he looked down at Bai Xuan. \u201cIt isn\u2019t enough. If we didn\u2019t have to go to your parent\u2019s house then I really want to eat you now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan reacted to his meaning and blushed shyly. He slapped at Xie Shurong\u2019s restless hands. \u201cCan you show some shame? It is morning!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I only want you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was literally speechless because of this person. He simply ignored Xie Shurong and turned around. \u201cWhere are the things to be grabbed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, here they are.\u201d Xie Shurong got up and took gift boxes of various colours from the cabinet. Bai Xuan\u2019s eyes widened with surprise. \u201cAren\u2019t you being too exaggerated? Why did you buy so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my first time entering your house and I must not be empty-handed? What if Mother and Father don\u2019t like me? I should bribe them with presents first.\u201d He spoke bluntly and didn\u2019t look embarrassed at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t call them Mother and Father\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan rubbed his temples as he felt himself getting a headache. He looked at the other person helplessly, \u201cYou\u2019re younger than me and should call them Uncle and Auntie, understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is better to call them Young Uncle and Younger Auntie since it sounds younger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Just do whatever.\u201d Bai Xuan took half the boxes and went out. Xie Shurong immediately grabbed the other half. The two of them left the hotel and walked a few hundred metres to the community where Bai Xuan\u2019s house was located.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Mother Bai was cooking in the kitchen. She asked while cutting vegetables, \u201cWhat type of boyfriend do you think our son will bring back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Bai was serious. \u201cHow can I guess? Our son likes him so don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, our son has been obedient and sensible since he was a child. He must have his own thoughts on emotional matters. Although he can\u2019t bring back a wife but as long as he is happy, I can feel relieved.\u201d Mother Bai paused before adding, \u201cI\u2019m just afraid his boyfriend isn\u2019t sincere.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait and see. Bai Xuan\u2019s vision shouldn\u2019t be bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people were chatting when the sound of the key in the door was heard. Bai Xuan\u2019s parents rushed out of the kitchen and were stunned when they saw the person behind Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>The man was taller than Bai Xuan. He was very handsome and had a sunny smile but he was only in his early 20s. Was such a young and handsome guy reliable?</p><br/><p>Before Bai Xuan could speak, Xie Shurong took the initiative to go forward and politely bowed. \u201cHello, Uncle and Auntie! My name is Xie Shurong and I\u2019m Bai Xuan\u2019s boyfriend. This is the first time we\u2019re meeting and I didn\u2019t know what to bring. Thus, I bought some supplements. I hope that Auntie and Uncle will be in good health.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Bai was flattered as she received the many high-end gift boxes. She smiled and said, \u201cYou are very polite. Why bring so many things? Come and sit down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong quietly walked over and Mother Bai glanced at her husband. The two people went to the kitchen to serve the dishes and she wondered in a worried manner, \u201cThis child is quite handsome and polite. Do you think that Bai Xuan specifically invited an actor to reassure us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Bai frowned. \u201cYou are watching too many TV dramas! How can our son find an actor to fool us? Don\u2019t you know this person? He is on the same team as our son and plays the swordsman. The one named Shu!</p><br/><p>Mother Bai suddenly realized. \u201cAh, no wonder why he is so familiar. It turns out to be our son\u2019s partner. Then I\u2019m relieved. At the very least, a person on the same team isn\u2019t a lie. He is just\u2026 a bit younger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Father Bai told her, \u201cIsn\u2019t it good to be younger? A younger person\u2019s mind is more simple and easily disciplined. An older and deeply experienced person might not be easily held by our son.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Mother Bai was completely relieved.</p><br/><p>Previously, they watched the matches and there weren\u2019t many shots directed at the participants. Even then, it was only side shots.</p><br/><p>Now they saw the real person at a close distance and found this Shu was much better than the TV. His figure was good, he was tall, handsome and he matched well with Bai Xuan. Mother Bai was very satisfied. Once the cooked dishes were on the table, she gave a bowl of stewed pork ribs to Xie Shurong and let him eat more.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo delicious!\u201d Xie Shurong tasted a pork rib and immediately smiled. \u201cAuntie, do you specialize in cooking? This dish is better than the chef of a five star hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Bai smiled. \u201cYou are really sweet. How can my dishes be so good?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAuntie, don\u2019t be humble. It is really delicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Bai was very happy about being praised. The more she saw, the more she felt this young and handsome person was very cute. She couldn\u2019t help giving him a piece of chicken wings. \u201cTry this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong praised while eating, \u201cGood, delicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan sat next to them and couldn\u2019t even insert himself\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was a person who loved food and his mouth was sweet. Mother Bai was quickly coaxed by him and continued to give Xie Shurong dishes. She willingly fed all the food she made to Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong also wasn\u2019t polite. He swept away all the food and was full of praise when eating.</p><br/><p>Originally it was expected that the first meeting would be awkward but Xie Shurong\u2019s mouth was sweet and he was extraordinarily warm, like everyone was family.</p><br/><p>Mother Bai obviously liked him a lot and Father Bai didn\u2019t say anything but his eyes showed his appreciation.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw this scene and finally felt relieved. Xie Shurong was often childish and naive but he was reliable in key moments, knowing how to curry favour with elders. In such a short period of time, he actually got the goodwill of Bai Xuan\u2019s parents. Bai Xuan had to say that this guy\u2019s mouth was very important when talking to people.</p><br/><p>After the meal, Xie Shurong took the initiative to stand up and help Mother Bai wash the dishes. He rolled up his sleeves and said, \u201cAuntie, I will help you with the dishes. I am especially talented at washing dishes. I used to wash dishes for Bai Xuan when we were with the team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan heard this and almost slipped. In the past, every time it came to washing dishes then a spoiled man would hold onto him, complaining, \u201cCan I not wash the dishes? I hate washing dishes.\u201d As a result, today he became active in helping to wash the dishes. Black became white. Xie Shurong, can you not have such a comic dialogue?</p><br/><p>At Bai Xuan\u2019s eyes, Xie Shurong just blinked in a shameless manner. He ignored Bai Xuan\u2019s speechless contempt and followed Mother Bai into the kitchen to wash the dishes.</p><br/><p>Mother Bai loved the \u2018hardworking\u2019 young guy who \u2018liked housework.\u2019 She saw his hands tidying up the dishes and laughed. \u201cNow there are very few young people who like to do housework. Ah Shu, you are really sensible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled. \u201cBai Xuan\u2019s cooking must be inherited from you? His food is especially delicious. I can\u2019t cook so I can only help him wash the dishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm.\u201d Mother Bai thought about it and asked, \u201cHow long have you been with Bai Xuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been almost a year. I chased him at first and he didn\u2019t like me much. I was younger than him and not mature enough. I always felt I wasn\u2019t worthy of him.\u201d Xie Shurong paused before speaking seriously, \u201cAuntie, rest assured. I will try my best to match him. I am younger than him but I really like him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Bai was completely moved and patted Xie Shurong\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t say that. Bai Xuan was blessed to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAuntie, I was blessed to meet him. He has a good personality and temper. I have never seen such a kind person. It would be nice to be with him all the time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Bai smiled. \u201cYes, our Bai Xuan is single-minded when it comes to feelings. You just have to treat him well and he will certainly treat you well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so too!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>They finished washing the dishes and Mother Bai\u2019s smile was brighter than before. She was obviously very happy with Xie Shurong and took the initiative to cut an apple for him. Know that even Bai Xuan didn\u2019t receive this treatment at home.</p><br/><p>She was going to have Xie Shurong stay for dinner but Bai Xuan was worried that Xie Shurong would speak nonsense to his parents and told her, \u201cMother, I will take Ah Shu out to eat tonight. He hasn\u2019t eaten authentic Hangzhou food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Bai immediately nodded in agreement. \u201cOkay, take him to taste west lake vinegar fish and dongpo meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong stood up. \u201cAuntie, I\u2019ll go first. I\u2019ll see you later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Bai opened her mouth, \u201cWait, Auntie has something to give you.\u201d She headed to the bedroom and took out a delicate box, carefully handing it to Xie Shurong. \u201cThis is for you. Later, you and Bai Xuan should get along well. Understood?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s eyes were as big as a cow. \u201cMother, this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong realized this must be a very meaningful thing and didn\u2019t wait for Bai Xuan to oppose it. He immediately accepted and responded seriously, \u201cAuntie, rest assured, I will be good to him for the rest of my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The two people left and walked side by side. Xie Shurong took out the box that Mother Bai gave him and there was actually a valuable jade pendant inside.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong\u2019s eyes lit up and he glanced over at Bai Xuan. \u201cIs this a family heirloom?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what is it? Based on Mother\u2019s cautious attitude, it definitely isn\u2019t an ordinary gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>His way of calling Mother had become smoother. Bai Xuan was too lazy to care about it. After a moment of silence, he touched his nose in an embarrassed manner. \u201cCough, this is what my mother bought when I was born. She was going to give it to\u2026 her daughter-in-law in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong glanced at the pendant with surprise. Then he reacted to what happened and smiled brightly. He turned to hug Bai Xuan. \u201cIt seems that Mother has recognized me. Then can I be your wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan blushed and gently pushed him. \u201cWhat wife\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong brazenly kissed Bai Xuan. \u201cThen will you be my wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s face became redder and he reprimanded, \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong immediately changed his words. \u201cCan I become your official boyfriend. Based on my performance, can I get a promotion and a raise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was helpless. \u201cLet go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Boss doesn\u2019t let me obtain full status then I won\u2019t let you go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been almost a year since I entered the company and there are three months left on the internship.\u201d Xie Shurong placed his chin on Bai Xuan\u2019s shoulder and acted petulantly. \u201cI want to be your official boyfriend. I don\u2019t want to worry every day. Let me be a full time member. I will show a good performance. Don\u2019t wait for the year\u2019s deadline and let\u2019s continue together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was softened by him and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cThat\u2026 okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong heard this and a glimmer of light flashed in his eyes. They became particularly deep and the petulant person holding Bai Xuan became a man.</p><br/><p>He knew that Bai Xuan still wasn\u2019t sure about their relationship and had no confidence spending the rest of his life with Xie Shurong. Still, it didn\u2019t matter. One day, he would let Bai Xuan put down all the worries in his heart and really fall in love with Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong placed Mother Bai\u2019s gift in his pocket and happily held the person in his arms.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

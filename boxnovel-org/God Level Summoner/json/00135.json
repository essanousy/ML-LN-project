He smiled and wondered, \u201cYou are so big yet you\u2019re still watching cartoons. Aren\u2019t you afraid of people making fun of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong put his iPad down and looked up at Bai Xuan, raising his eyebrows and pretending to be serious. \u201cI might but an adult but I still maintain a childlike heart. Don\u2019t you know this is very rare?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan laughed. \u201cThe meaning is that you aren\u2019t young but you\u2019re still childish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong looked at Bai Xuan with a wronged expression. \u201cWhy are you always hitting me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan ignored him and starting drying his hair.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong put away his iPad and asked, \u201cDo you really think that Ling Xuefeng came to Guangzhou for a business trip? Why do I feel like it isn\u2019t quite right? He came to Guangzhou for business just as Cat God is sick?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled slightly and said, \u201cDon\u2019t meddle. Take care of yourself first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong made an innocent expression. \u201cHow am I not taking care of myself? Today I played so well that Old Zhang praised me. You never praise me. You only complimented Xiao Li and Xiao Zhuo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There were some grievances in his voice when he complained.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan put down the hairdryer and looked helplessly back at him. \u201cHow old are you? You\u2019re not a 17 or 18 year old newcomer. Do I need to praise you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong got up from the bed and cheekily walked behind him, reaching out to hug Bai Xuan from behind. He placed his chin on Bai Xuan\u2019s shoulder and wondered, \u201cHaven\u2019t you heard? No matter how good a person is, they are actually looking forward to be praised and acknowledged by others. Can\u2019t you praise me with a few words? I want to hear you complimenting me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had to reach out and pat his head. \u201cYes, you are very reliable when playing the game. You are especially smart, tall, handsome and you have an impeccable personality. You even wash dishes better than other people. You are the most perfect person in the world\u2026 is this enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong listened to the perfunctory praise and didn\u2019t let go, holding Bai Xuan tighter instead.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t enough?\u201d Bai Xuan looked at Ah Shu shamelessly wrapped around him and couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cDid you intelligence regress to a kindergarten student? Xiao Shu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong saw this man\u2019s soft eyes and suddenly found it difficult to breathe.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had just showered. His skin was as white as flawless jade, his rosy lips were covered with a hint of water vapor, his body was fresh with the smell of shower gel and his voice was so gently that it made people\u2019s hearts\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw Xie Shurong staring at him in a daze and couldn\u2019t help reaching out to hit him on the back of the head. \u201cHey, I am asking you something!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t admit that he was watching a man like this!</p><br/><p>He was the handsome Tree God!</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the Xiao Shu whose intelligence had regressed to a kindergarten student!</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong touched his nose and said, \u201cYou just praised me in an exaggerated manner and there is no sincerity at all. Do it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan exclaimed, \u201cThere are too many problems!\u201d</p><br/><p>He still looked good despite his anger. His round eyes staring\u2026</p><br/><p>The two of them were too close. As long as Xie Shurong slightly leaned forward, he could kiss Bai Xuan on the lips.</p><br/><p>Would his lips be soft when kissed?</p><br/><p>Shouldn\u2019t it be soft? After all\u2026 Bai Xuan was such a gentle person. Holding him was so comfortable that kissing him must also be soft.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong put away the strange thoughts that suddenly popped into his mind and pulled back to reality. Then he realized that his body had reacted and he immediately let go of Bai Xuan in an embarrassed manner.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan didn\u2019t notice anything was wrong.</p><br/><p>He was used to being held by Xie Shurong in a petulant manner. When they were in the United States, Xie Shurong would always try to curry favour in order to not wash the dishes. After returning to China, he would still shamelessly demand ribs from Bai Xuan. This guy was more childish than Zhuo Hang and Li Xiaojiang.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had long been accustomed to being hugged by Ah Shu and thought it was just a joke. Therefore, he didn\u2019t care and turned back to the mirror to finish blow drying his hair. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to know why Ling Xuefeng came to Guangzhou this time. You just have to know that he and Cat God are equally responsible captains and won\u2019t affect the team due to personal matters.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you believe in Cat God?\u201d Xie Shurong couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cDo you believe him in any circumstances?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. I have been friends with him for many years.\u201d Bai Xuan replied.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong\u2019s heart inexplicably felt uncomfortable and he frowned. \u201cIs Cat God very important to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan nodded without hesitation. \u201cYes, he is like family.\u201d</p><br/><p>A question popped into Xie Shurong\u2019s head. \u2018If he is family to you, what about me? Am I just a teammate? Is he much more important in your heart than me?\u2019</p><br/><p>Once this question popped out, Xie Shurong was startled. Why was he comparing himself to Cat God? Cat God was the captain. Wasn\u2019t it normal for Bai Xuan to care more about the captain. Besides, they had been partners for many years and faced a lot of bitterness and setbacks together. There was nothing wrong with them being very close.</p><br/><p>Still, Xie Shurong couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit uncomfortable and sour, like he was jealous.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw that Xie Shurong was suddenly silent and looked back in a confused manner, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did Ah Shu seem weird today?</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan placed a hand against Xie Shurong\u2019s forehead in a natural manner. He wanted to see if this guy had a fever. Perhaps he caught it from Cat God? Otherwise, why would he ask such strange questions?</p><br/><p>However, his hand had just touched the forehead when it was suddenly grabbed. Xie Shurong\u2019s fingers were particularly tight and Bai Xuan\u2019s hand was almost crushed. Extremely complex emotions flashed in Xie Shurong\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at him in a bewildered manner. \u201cWhat is it? Are you in a bad mood?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He quickly released the hand like he got an electric shock. Xie Shurong\u2019s heartbeat was extremely fast as he quickly turned his eyes away. He awkwardly cried out, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing! I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he fell down on his bed and buried himself in his quilt.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at this person wrapped up in the blanket and smiled slightly before ignoring him.</p><br/><p>Ah Shu\u2019s sleeping posture was quite interesting. This guy was 21 years old but his personality was like a big boy. Sometimes he would act in a really childish manner. Bai Xuan didn\u2019t find it strange.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan finished drying his hair and went to sleep.</p><br/><p>In the next bed, Xie Shurong was rolling around in his blanket and finding it hard to sleep.</p><br/><p>He has seen many beautiful people before but Bai Xuan was special. His gently temperament entered deeply into his bone marrow. Bai Xuan\u2019s movements, voice, smile and eyes were all gentle. People couldn\u2019t help wanting to be close to him. Even if nothing happened, just listening to him speak was a special type of enjoyment.</p><br/><p>How could Xie Shurong watch a man in a daze? It was just unbelievable\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong slammed his head against the pillows. He close his eyes and slept.</p><br/><p>In his dreams, Bai Xuan once again appeared. He was smiling and looking at his picture, making Xie Shurong\u2019s heart feel unbearably itchy. He wanted to pounce and bit Bai Xuan a few times.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Once he woke up the next morning, Xie Shurong found that his underwear was wet and ran to the bathroom to wash it.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw him running to the bathroom and couldn\u2019t help caring. \u201cDo you have diarrhea?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong sighed as he looked at the white liquid. He felt a bit dazed and distressed.</p><br/><p>At noon, the team gathered in one place. The match was still being commanded by Zhang Jueming. Old Zhang carefully arranged the tactics and lineup before taking everyone to the venue.</p><br/><p>The opponent wasn\u2019t strong but there were some minor problems in the team battles. The final score was determined to be 14:7, requiring three rounds in the arena and three rounds for the team battles.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s cold wasn\u2019t completely better but his mental state was good. Thus, he also went to the venue.</p><br/><p>After the match, he had dinner with Ling Xuefeng while Bai Xuan took the other players to a group dinner.</p><br/><p>The captain was absent from dinner again, making the teenagers very confused. However, they didn\u2019t dare ask and could only return to the hotel after eating with the vice-captain.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was chatting with Qin Mo every day to learn Chinese. Today was no exception. On the way back to the hotel, he sent a message to Qin Mo: [My master didn\u2019t have dinner with us is it because he is having dinner with your teacher.]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo replied: [It is polite to type with punctuation.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han: [Oh.]</p><br/><p>Then he added the punctuation and carefully resent the message.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was pleased. He always felt that his position at the bottom of the food chain had changed. At least in the matter of learning Chinese, Xiao Han always listened to him!</p><br/><p>[My master went to Guangzhou to sign a contract with the BTA live broadcast platform. Wind Colour promised to cooperate with them. Later, professional players will broadcast a first perspective video and teach netizens how to play the arena.] Qin Mo patiently explained.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han said: [But his room is next door to my master\u2019s room.]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo: [What\u2019s wrong with that?]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han: [He came to see Master and has dinner with Master every day.]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was surprised: [Is that right?]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han: [What do you think they are talking about all day? Will there be any plans? Is it like when they had me practice with you?]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo: [Get lost! I don\u2019t have time to be your sparring partner! And don\u2019t always use question marks! It is annoying to see!]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han: [Then why do you always use exclamation marks?]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo: [\u2026]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han: [What does the ellipsis mean?]</p><br/><p>[Your friend Shepherd is offline.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han looked at Qin Mo\u2019s dark symbol and was still confused. He felt that Chinese was really profound and didn\u2019t understand the meaning of many symbols, especially the ellipsis. The meaning was too rich.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng stayed in Guangzhou for half a month before returning to Shanghai. During this two week period, the youngsters of the Canglan team grew rapidly. The cooperation between Zhuo Li became smoother while Xiao Gu and Xiao Han\u2019s play stabilized. Zhang Jueming and Li Cangyu\u2019s command styles were different but the teammates cooperated well. Canglan won more games than they lost and stayed in the top three of the rankings.</p><br/><p>The schedule for the second division was very tight, allowing the intense competition to hone the players\u2019 pressure resistance. After a few ups and downs,the four teenagers matured a lot. Even if they occasionally lost, they wouldn\u2019t be frustrated as they were in the beginning.</p><br/><p>Next, Li Cangyu started to hone the other combinations in Canglan.</p><br/><p>For example, letting Ah Shu and Zhuo Hang fight together in a fast and fast combination or letting Gu Siming resist the opponents while Xiao Han used this opportunity to assassinate the enemies. There was also Ah Shu and Bai Xuan or Li Cangyu bringing Old Zhang to assist him\u2026</p><br/><p>In more than 10 games, it was difficult for the audience to see a repeated lineup. The commentators Chen Weiwei and Shao Yu were very happy to see this because it was refreshing every time they explained a game.</p><br/><p>The audience also noticed that Cat God was using the second division as a training ground.</p><br/><p>The giant teams in the first division were much stronger than the second division. It was impossible to train the newcomers in the first division or Canglan would be in danger of not entering the playoffs.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the overall strength of the second division was weak. After the Yaohua game that they lost due to Cat God\u2019s mistakes, Canglan never suffered when in came to scores and their ranking was stably in the top three. It was reasonable for Cat God to use this opportunity to train the four newcomers. After all, he was aiming for the first division.</p><br/><p>Time passed quickly and it was the end of April.</p><br/><p>After experiencing more than 10 games, the Canglan team finally entered the playoffs stage of the second division with a rank of third.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

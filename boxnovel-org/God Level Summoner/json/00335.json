The Chinese team\u2019s practice of dividing the battlefield greatly weakened the Korean team\u2019s defense while Xie Shurong\u2019s experience in dealing with healers was quite rich. His close proximity was simply a nightmare for healers.</p><br/><p>He could no longer let Xie Shurong interfere with the South Korean team\u2019s back row. Park Joonseo decisively changed strategies. \u201cKill the swordsman first!\u201d</p><br/><p>The South Korean swordsman and assassin heard this and turned back to Xie Shurong. The white magician and archer acted as remote output assistance and for a moment, all skills were directed at Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong\u2019s blood started to drop dramatically and he fell to 25% residual blood in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan certainly wouldn\u2019t watch Ah Shu be killed. He took a few steps forward and used Holy Light Surge to instantly restore Xie Shurong\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>Originally, this move could restore 50% of his teammates blood but the audience found that Bai Xuan\u2019s skill only added 20%.</p><br/><p>\u201cPark Joonseo used the skill of the six-winged angel to greatly reduce the effectiveness of healing skills!\u201d Kou Hongyi explained.</p><br/><p>The six-winged angel was a very useful auxiliary pet for an angel summoner. It had two skills. One was Angel\u2019s Light, which gave a barrier all teammates within range, allowing them to be immune to damage and control for five seconds. The other was Angel\u2019s Wings, which greatly reduced the defense of the target as well as the healing effect on the target.</p><br/><p>Park Joonseo placed this skill on Xie Shurong and Ah Shu\u2019s defense was greatly reduced as well as Bai Xuan\u2019s blood-adding skill. This meant the Korean team could kill Xie Shurong with less effort.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong also knew this and typed on the team channel: [Don\u2019t save me!]</p><br/><p>He was telling Bai Xuan to give up and not save him.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw these worlds and immediately stopped adding blood to Ah Shu. As a healer, he had to calmly judge the situation on the field and abandon certain teammates when necessary.</p><br/><p>Ah Shu took the initiative to give up on himself and this made Bai Xuan feel better. He clearly realized that Xie Shurong was an outstanding player who knew the big picture. At the critical moment, there would be no gains unless there was a sacrifice.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong only had a trace of blood left and was about to die. Then he suddenly moved to the archer Kim Yoonhee and released all his available skills\u2014Breaking Bone Sword, Devouring Soul Sword and Blood-sucking Sword!</p><br/><p>The extremely fast release of three skills combined with two general attacks created a dazzling and sharp play. Kim Yoonhee\u2019s blood was directly cut to 25% residual blood!</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was killed but he once again made a breakthrough for the Chinese team.</p><br/><p>This breakthrough was the Korean team\u2019s vice-captain, Kim Yoonhee.</p><br/><p>An archer had very weak defense. After being beaten, Kim Yoonhee used Flying Feather Steps to run but Ling Xuefeng wouldn\u2019t give her a chance to escape. It was impossible to let Ah Shu\u2019s breakthrough be wasted.</p><br/><p>He summoned four skeleton infantry and surrounded her on all sides before exploding them.</p><br/><p>He had long been familiar with the operation of the demon pets. Kim Yoonhee didn\u2019t have time to run away before being killed by Ling Xuefeng!</p><br/><p>The South Korean team now only had one white magician, one assassin and one auxiliary.</p><br/><p>The Chinese team had Ah Shu killed while the two black magicians and two summoners survived. Moreover, Ah Shu had played his role before dying by laying the foundation for his teammates.</p><br/><p>Next was the big explosive moment after Ling Xuefeng\u2019s command!</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan used the group attack skills they had been saving, Shadow Winding and Hell Flames!</p><br/><p>Qin Mo\u2019s blood kin pet followed up with Blood Bat Festival!</p><br/><p>The big moves hit in succession and the South Korean team were beaten to residual blood.</p><br/><p>Of course, Shim Yoocheol couldn\u2019t let the black magicians keep casting. He turned and used Light and Shadow Rotation to interrupt the opponent\u2019s casting, causing a lot of damage to two black magicians.</p><br/><p>However, the Chinese team had Bai Xuan. Bai Xuan used a handy healing array and filled up their blood.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo and Ling Xuefeng started to move quickly. The blood kin pets and demon pets attacked the Korean team and their bodies were covered with a negative state.</p><br/><p>The South Korean swordsman Shim Yoocheol and assassin Kim Changmin jointly killed the black magician Guo Xuan while Ling Xuefeng killed Shin Chimin.</p><br/><p>The two South Korean melee worked together. One controlled the healer while the other killed Yan Ruiwen. It was a pity that they had just killed Yan Ruiwen when the news of Park Joonseo\u2019s death appeared on the screen.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was still the recipient of the harvest.</p><br/><p>Shim Yoocheol and Kim Changmin didn\u2019t have much blood left at this time. The consequences would be unthinkable if Ling Xuefeng took another head!</p><br/><p>Park Joonseo hurriedly said, \u201cDon\u2019t fight. Withdraw!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it was too late to withdraw.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo had been assisting his master by having the blood snakes bite people. Shim and Kim\u2019s bodies already had five layers of bleeding on them. After seeing that the other side was going to withdraw, Qin Mo used the blood spider to fix them in place. Ling Xuefeng followed by exploding the skeletons and killed two people in one breath!</p><br/><p>The cooperation between mentor and apprentice was quite tacit. The South Korean team killed three members of the Chinese team but were entirely wiped out. The most frightening thing was that all the heads went to Ling Xuefeng!</p><br/><p>[Ling Xuefeng has become a great god!]</p><br/><p>The message on the screen was a blow that made Park Joonseo instantly wake up. The always calm South Korean captain now showed an anxious look.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, Qin Mo and Bai Xuan stayed in place to kill the ice dragon. The small boss didn\u2019t have high attack and it was relatively easy to kill. The three of them successfully killed the ice dragon and returned to join their teammates.</p><br/><p>The whole group obtained the ice dragon\u2019s economic bonus and their money was abundant.</p><br/><p>In particular, Ling Xuefeng killed so many people and the amount of money on his body made the crowd drool.</p><br/><p>He directly bought his favourite weapon, Demon God\u2019s Curse.</p><br/><p>The shape of the staff was very special and the top had a skeleton-like shape. The skeleton\u2019s eyes glowed with black flames which looked frightening. However, Ling Xuefeng\u2019s fans believed that their male god holding the staff with his summoner\u2019s costume was too cool.</p><br/><p>The effect of the staff was to increase the damage of Skeleton Explosion as well as the summoning distance and casting distance of the banshee. Ling Xuefeng was especially good at using the banshee to control the field. With this weapon, the operation of his banshee would be more varied. Skeleton Explosion was the most commonly used attack skill of the demon summoner and this weapon could greatly enhance Ling Xuefeng\u2019s output ability.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan didn\u2019t gain any heads but both of them bought rings with extra attack power. Qin Mo bought the Blood Duke\u2019s Ring to increase the control time. Bai Xuan and Xie Shurong bought lamps to widen their field of view.</p><br/><p>The speed of professional players was very fast. Everyone finished buying their equipment and props in just a few seconds. Ling Xuefeng looked at the map and ordered decisively, \u201cGo directly to the crystal!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the commentators\u2019 room, Kou Hongyi found it hard to hide his expectations. He quickly said, \u201cCaptain Ling has gained his weapon and nearly doubled his attack power! All members of the Chinese team have supplemented their equipment and their advantage against the fire dragon is very obvious!\u201d As he spoke, Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t lead the team to fight the dragon. Instead, he went straight to the middle crystal. Kou Hongyi immediately stopped talking and his voice became shocked. \u201cThey are going directly to the crystal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing nodded. \u201cIt seems like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Generally speaking, it was necessary to accumulate enough equipment in an economic war. After killing the fire dragon, they would rely on the buff to push towards the crystal. Sometimes, one party would get a large number of heads in the early stages. If the advantage was obvious, they would choose to push directly to the crystal.</p><br/><p>However, there was a prerequisite for directly pushing to the crystal. There needed to be a time difference or the confidence to win against the opposite side.</p><br/><p>This time, players on both sides died and the resurrection time was similar. It was impossible for there to be a time difference.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng dared to lead the team to directly push to the crystal, proving that he had enough confidence to stop the Korean team\u2019s interference.</p><br/><p>The Chinese team arrived at the central highlands. QIn Mo\u2019s blood knight acted as a guardian in front. The others quickly killed the beasts and opened the channel to the crystal.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng calmly said, \u201cQin Mo, Yan Guo and Bai Xuan will guard the exit. Ah Shu, follow me!\u201d</p><br/><p>He left three ranged players and a healer to guard the door while taking Xie Shurong to play the crystal. This was because Ah Shu\u2019s attack speed was extremely fast and he could greatly speed up the destruction of the crystal.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Ling Xuefeng and Xie Shurong arrived at the crystal and Xie Shurong immediately attacked crazily.</p><br/><p>The thing he was best at was ordinary attack combos. He could often make combos against moving opponents. Then what about a static crystal?</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Shurong released his full hand speed and actually hit the crystal 10 times in five seconds!</p><br/><p>The damage kept doubling and the crystal\u2019s blood was dropping swiftly.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng had luxurious equipment and kept summoning skeletons to explode them. The two people joined hands and removed one-third of the crystal\u2019s blood in an instant.</p><br/><p>The South Korean players rushed over in a hurry.</p><br/><p>They had just guessed wrong. They thought the Chinese team would kill the fire dragon and set up an ambush there. It wasn\u2019t until the crystal was being attacked prompt appeared on the screen that they rushed over. However, their rhythm was significantly slower by one step.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen was waiting in ambush at the highlands. He immediately used Dark Fear to set all of the Korean team in place.</p><br/><p>The healer Bae Eunki used Purification to help her teammates but Guo Xuan followed with another Dark Fear. The control skills of the two black magicians were almost seamless.</p><br/><p>The urgent South Korean team was forced to wait for the control to end. Once the three-second control effect ended, Park Joonseo opened the six-winged angel\u2019s barrier to make his teammates immune to all control and injuries.</p><br/><p>They turned towards the highlands but they arrived at the entrance only to find that Qin Mo had placed his death knight to block the narrow entrance!</p><br/><p>The death knight was the bodyguard of the blood kin summoner and its thick skin didn\u2019t lose to the paladin. Even so, it was a pet and the blood volume was slightly lower. Generally speaking, it wasn\u2019t difficult to kill.</p><br/><p>However, today there was a healer next to it!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan hid behind the knight and quickly added five layers of Healing Language on the knight. The Korean team gathered to kill the death knight and Bai Xuan quickly added blood to it.</p><br/><p>The South Korean audience was having a bit of a meltdown. There were so many gods only to be blocked by a blood kin pet. They wouldn\u2019t have believed it if they weren\u2019t seeing it with their eyes.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s healing ability was really strong and methodically added blood. Qin Mo\u2019s pet was maintained at a half blood state in his car. Park Joonseo frowned before using the Light God\u2019s Blessing to improve the attack power of the whole group. This wave of explosions killed Qin Mo\u2019s pet knight.</p><br/><p>Shim Yoocheol\u2019s swordsman took the lead in breaking through the narrow channel. Once he saw the crystal\u2019s blood, his heart fell to the keyboard. In the blink of an eye, the crystal\u2019s blood was only 30%!</p><br/><p>Park Joonseo saw this and ordered, \u201cGo and interrupt them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shim Yoocheol and Kim Changmin quickly moved only for Ling Xuefeng to summon the banshee and used Witch Demon\u2019s Curse.</p><br/><p>The demon beauty put her hands together and pulled the South Korean players to her side.</p><br/><p>Due to the weapon\u2019s increased distance bonus, Ling Xuefeng\u2019s banshee was summoned far below the highlands. The South Korean team had just rushed up only to be pulled down by the banshee. It was equivalent to wasting time.</p><br/><p>They tried to rush over again only to find that Yan Ruiwen, Guo Xuan, Qin Mo and Bai Xuan were blocking the entrance. This was an \u2018unless you step on our bodies, don\u2019t think about going to the highlands\u2019 momentum!</p><br/><p>The six players of the South Korean team naturally weren\u2019t afraid of the four Chinese players but Bai Xuan\u2019s healing was enough to delay the time.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t afford this because the crystal was going to break!</p><br/><p>Park Joonseo directly used the ice woman\u2019s Frost Soul to freeze all four Chinese people and then said, \u201cQuickly kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Changmin used the assassin\u2019s stealth to penetrate through the obstacles and successfully bypassed the Chinese team, quickly arriving at the crystal.</p><br/><p>The thing that made him feel desperate was that he only saw the crystal breaking.</p><br/><p>There was a loud band and crystal fragments flew through the air, shining under the sunlight.</p><br/><p>The word \u2018Failure\u2019 popped up on the big screen and the Korean team failed to save the battle.</p><br/><p>On the Chinese side, there was the golden \u2018Victory\u2019 on the screen.</p><br/><p>The third game was won and the score became 2:1. The Chinese team took the lead in gaining match point!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

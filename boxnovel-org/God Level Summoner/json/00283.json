He was full of blood and had half his blue left.</p><br/><p>He used Wind and Clouds Destruction to directly kill one of the Spanish swordsmen. Then he killed the other swordsman with the help of Xiao Zhu\u2019s arrays and hadn\u2019t consumed too much blue.</p><br/><p>In the second stage, the Spanish team sent the female players Benita and Karona, a swordsman and berserker combination. Li Cangyu had carefully studied the Spanish team\u2019s lineup and knew about this pair of sisters. The berserker played very calmly. The swordsman\u2019s hand speed was extremely fast and her general style was a bit similar to Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>It was 2v1 against a summoner. The two sisters of the Spanish team were confident.</p><br/><p>At the beginning, Benita carried her giant axe and walked to the middle of the plank road. Karona didn\u2019t fall and followed behind her teammate. The narrow terrain didn\u2019t affect them and it was enough to see their tacit understanding.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t in a hurry. His wind spirit\u2019s cooldown time had ended. It was best if he could find a chance to use the map to kill one of them. If he couldn\u2019t, he would lower the opponent\u2019s blood as much as possible so that the next Su Yu combination could play more smoothly.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate to summon the water spirit. The moment the other party was about to catch up with him, the water spirit\u2019s Water Ball struck, slowing down their speed. Then he used Flying Feather Steps to move back.</p><br/><p>Due to the elf\u2019s fast speed, the berserker and swordsman couldn\u2019t catch up with him for a while. Karona couldn\u2019t bear it anymore. She directly rushed towards Li Cangyu and used Spirit Lock!</p><br/><p>At the same time, the berserker Benita used a teleport skill to jump behind Li Cangyu and used Mountain Chop to make a huge hole in the plank road, blocking the road behind him.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was faced with a front and back pincer attack. He was simultaneously hit by Light and Shadow Rotation and Benita\u2019s Cut Through Thorns!</p><br/><p>Karona was just using Breaking Bone Sword to take away his life when Li Cangyu suddenly moved, crossing Karona and reaching the bottom of the plank road!</p><br/><p>Karona only felt that there was a flower in front of her eyes. Despite there being only half a metre of space next to her, a figure actually flashed past like a gust of wind!</p><br/><p>The audience was almost speechless by the bold operation of Cat God on the plank road!</p><br/><p>He almost hung out by one foot yet he could run so quickly on the edge of the cliff!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng watched the battle in the rest area and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cHis positioning is truly amazing.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a clear appreciation and pride in his tone.</p><br/><p>The brainless fan Cheng Wei sitting next to him immediately agreed. \u201cYes! I think that if Miracle was to hold a match in the sky then our Cat God would definitely take the championship!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi praised in the commentator\u2019s room. \u201cThe two players of the Spanish team must want to vomit blood! They just surrounded Cat God to prevent him from running away. They even deliberately stood on the edge of the cliff to block him. They didn\u2019t expect\u2026 Cat God can cleverly move past them even with the smallest bit of distance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were hit in the face by Cat God\u2019s movements.\u201d Yu Bing spoke calmly.</p><br/><p>This felt like the two people were just about to catch a cat only for the cat to sneak out of a crack like a gust of wind\u2026</p><br/><p>Karona and Benita were stunned and immediately turned around.</p><br/><p>They were greeted by overwhelming ice and snow. The water spirit\u2019s Frost Heart!</p><br/><p>This was the big move of the water spirit. Li Cangyu had kept it, waiting for a key moment to control the opponents.</p><br/><p>He moved to the bottom of the plank road to escape the two people\u2019s pincer attack. Then he followed up with the water spirit\u2019s big move. It was too late by the time the opponents turned back. They were directly frozen in place by the ice and snow!</p><br/><p>The thing that made Li Cangyu feel regret was that the wind spirit\u2019s Wind and Clouds Destruction couldn\u2019t blow the other side off the cliff. This was because the point where the two opponents were frozen was a corner of the plank road with guardrails.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter. He might not be able to use the wind spirit to kill people but his fire spirit\u2019s cooldown was over.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t hesitate to summon the fire spirit.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t use the fire spirit\u2019s big move, Raging Prairie Fire. This skill could greatly reduce the blood volume of the two people but the consumption of blue was too much. If released, the remaining blue might not be able to kill one of them.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu calmly used the fire spirit\u2019s single target skill Fireball to hit the swordsman standing in front.</p><br/><p>The dazzling little fireballs were like fireworks hitting Karona\u2019s body and forcing her blood to fall to 60% in the blink of an eye!</p><br/><p>The summoner\u2019s terrible hand speed made Karona feel frightened. Once the control effect of Frost Heart was over, she immediately rushed forward and wanted to use her sword to interrupt the opponent\u2019s casting.</p><br/><p>At this time, Li Cangyu\u2019s water spirit used an accurate Water Ball to freeze Karona in place!</p><br/><p>The berserker Benita felt depressed. She wanted to catch up and block the opponent, but her teammate was frozen on the plank road and turned into a natural ice sculpture. This became an obstacle that blocked Benita\u2019s way!</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi saw the scene where the sisters were blocked on the narrow plank road and couldn\u2019t help laughing, \u201cHahaha, Cat God is too witty! The frozen effect will form an ice sculpture. Karona is frozen on a corner of the plank road and this blocks her sister from coming forward! Only one person is frozen but both people are controlled at the same time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu used the terrain in a precise and ingenious manner.</p><br/><p>Mount Huangshan Plank Road wasn\u2019t a straight path. It was a road suspended at the edge of the cliff and the corners were carefully fenced so that the competitors wouldn\u2019t fall when their visual field was blocked by the cliff. Still, once a person at the corner was frozen, the people behind them couldn\u2019t move past.</p><br/><p>This was the same as a traffic jam. If there was a car accident at a corner of the road, the left and right sides wouldn\u2019t be able to pass!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu happily continued using Fireball on Karona and her blood fell to 40%!</p><br/><p>Karona of Spain was a top master and a first-class player.</p><br/><p>She had never met such a strong summoner when playing the league at home but from this moment on, the summoner rose to become her most hated class!</p><br/><p>It was unbelievable that she was beaten to residual blood by a simple Fireball.</p><br/><p>Time proved that even if Li Cangyu didn\u2019t use any big moves, he could use the simplest attack skills to cause serious damage in a short amount of time.</p><br/><p>The freezing effect was finally lifted. The two players seemed crazy as they didn\u2019t hesitate to rush down. Their imposing appearance seemed like they would tear the fragile summoner in front of them to pieces!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was very calm. He still had 25% blue, which was why he had economically used Fireball to attack the opponent. At this time, he could no longer save his blue and Li Cangyu summoned the public pet, Departed Spirit! (TL: This was previously known as demon and the skill was demon possession. The author calls it Departed Spirit from now on so I\u2019m going to change it to this).</p><br/><p>After seeing the departed spirit appear, many domestic Cat God fans started to light candles for Karona.</p><br/><p>The rapidly descending Karona wasn\u2019t aware of this because Cat God\u2019s speed was too fast. He called the departed spirit and it attached itself to her back in almost one second!</p><br/><p>She was originally rushing down. As a result, the departed spirit attached to her and she suddenly abruptly slowed. It was like a high-speed car suddenly stopping. Due to inertia, Karona directly fell face-first onto the plank road!</p><br/><p>Benita, who was rushing behind her, couldn\u2019t put on the brakes in time and fell to the ground because of her teammate!</p><br/><p>The audience, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cat God, aren\u2019t you really good to the Spanish females?</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s expression remained calm. After using the departed spirit to slow down the opponent, he retreated into the distance and cast the thunder spirit\u2019s big move, Thunder\u2019s Wrath!</p><br/><p>A big move was worthy of being a big move. He might only have 5% blue left but it forced Karona\u2019s blood down to 10%.</p><br/><p>\u201cCat God only has 5% blue left!\u201d Kou Hongyi was a bit nervous. \u201cHe can still release a Fireball! However, one Fireball isn\u2019t enough to kill Karona. Perhaps he can use his ordinary attacks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing cried out, \u201cToo late!\u201d</p><br/><p>The berserker wasn\u2019t affected by the departed spirit and swung her giant axe at Li Cangyu!</p><br/><p>At this key moment, Li Cangyu made a fine operation that many people couldn\u2019t see clearly.</p><br/><p>Karona was trying to move forward to use a big move and kill this annoying summoner. However, the sword in her hand abruptly stopped as she was lifted into the air.</p><br/><p>A small fireball exploded against her chest, leaving her bloody on the ground.</p><br/><p>Karona stared at the grey screen in front of her as she wondered if something was wrong. How could a small fireball kill a swordsman who still had 10% blood left?</p><br/><p>She was surprised and opened the system\u2019s combat panel, looking at the replay of the information. Then her face turned as pale as paper.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu recalled the departed spirit.</p><br/><p>Recalling the departed spirit was actively killing the pet but a full agility summoner had a special feature. Once a pet was recalled, there was a chance of increasing the crit rate of the next attack.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu used this feature by recalling the departed spirit at the crucial moment and then using Fireball. This Fireball did critical damage and took away the bloody terran swordsman in one breath!</p><br/><p>Such sophisticated calculations, meticulous operations and absolute calm in crucial moments\u2026</p><br/><p>Was this person still human?</p><br/><p>Karona stared at the computer screen in a complicated mood and was really convinced.</p><br/><p>The Spanish team had very good players but the captain of the Chinese team, the summoner who never appeared in the world rankings\u2014today he slapped the faces of those watching the World Competition!</p><br/><p>\u201cThree kills, my god! Cat God completed three kills in the arena!\u201d Kou Hongyi jumped up excitedly. \u201cThe first person might\u2019ve died because of the wind spirit\u2019s control but the next two were killed using a precise layout and clever moves!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCat God really surprised us!\u201d Yu Bing was also excited. \u201cThe ID of Old Cat, from today on, it is no longer an unknown elf summoner. The world\u2019s Miracle fans will know that his name is Li Cangyu, the captain of our Chinese Miracle national team!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing\u2019s words caused the domestic live broadcast room to be filled with flowers and applause.</p><br/><p>In the Canglan Support Group, several administrators were crying.</p><br/><p>From the young man who lost many battles in his youth to the captain of the national team at the World Competition, this man suffered so much pressure but he never forgot his initial heart.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t feel discouraged or become arrogant.</p><br/><p>His face was still calm despite killing three opponents.</p><br/><p>This was the captain of their national team, Li Cangyu!</p><br/><p>Under his leadership, who would doubt that the Chinese team couldn\u2019t win the World Competition?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

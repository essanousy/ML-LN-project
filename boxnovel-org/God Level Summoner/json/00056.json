He also sent more than 20 groups of assassins to kill the mining people, delaying the economic development speed of the Bright Legion. In just 10 minutes, the gap between the two side\u2019s total economy became 110,000 to 150,000. The Bright Legion had fallen behind by 40,000!</p><br/><p>Now that three mines were taken away, this gap would only increase.</p><br/><p>Many people in the Bright Legion started to question the level of command, the public channels filled with swearing.</p><br/><p>[What is the commander doing? Isn\u2019t he going to make a comeback by stealing the mines from the opposite side?]</p><br/><p>[Give us a command to kill and steal their mines!]</p><br/><p>[Who is in command today? Can\u2019t we get a reliable one?]</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was controlling a side account and became furious at those who dared to scold Cat God. He couldn\u2019t help typing in the camp channel: [Everyone who is scolding the commander, shut up! you can you up\uff0cno can no BB!] (TL: author wrote this in English so I\u2019m literally just copying it.)</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Tan Shitian saw his angry appearance and couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cWhat are you so anxious about? This is a battle between Captain Ling and Cat God, we are just watching the fun. Captain Ling unexpectedly got the first hand but Cat God will certainly come up with a way to deal with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He just said this when there was a cold light behind him. A knife stabbed straight towards his chest in a calm and fierce attack!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian\u2019s side account was hit by the knife and directly had his blood reduced by one-third.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Tan Shitian immediately used the elf race\u2019s movement skill to jump back. He had just hidden when someone else aimed another blade straight at his chest!</p><br/><p>The elf side account was stabbed and his blood plummeted to 15%!</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei and Tan Shitian often argued but they had been teammates for 1.5 years. Once he saw that Tan Shitian was being beaten, Cheng Wei reflexively used the white magician\u2019s big move, God\u2019s Faith. A white light fell from the sky, enveloping Tan Shitian and removing the stealth from the two assassins!</p><br/><p>Their IDs were Wisp and Ghost Mirror. They were obviously from the Ghost Spirits Guild. The situation became very chaotic once they were revealed. The two killers realized they were exposed and were forced to use Combat Stealth, taking advantage of the chaos to hide their traces.</p><br/><p>Come with no shadow, leave without a trace, the decisive and aggressive assassination techniques really made people feel creepy.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei tried to chase them but couldn\u2019t find their shadows. He angrily typed on the keyboard: [You run faster than rabbits. Let\u2019s see when you don\u2019t have the ability to run anymore!]</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian said with a laugh, \u201cDon\u2019t you think these two killers are similar to two people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s understanding was poor and he said in a confused manner, \u201cThe two killers must be like two people. How can they be three people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Tan Shitian stretched out a hand and rubbed Cheng Wei\u2019s head hard. \u201cWhy are you so stupid? I mean that these two killers are very similar to the Lou Zhang combination of the Ghost Spirits team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was attracted by the latter half of the sentence and ignored Tan Shitian calling him stupid. His eyes widened with surprise as he asked, \u201cDo you mean Lou Wushuang and Zhang Shaohui? Those cousins are here as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian nodded. \u201cYes, it is probably to see Cat God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei couldn\u2019t help feeling angry again at the mention of this topic. \u201cLou Wushuang found out that Cat God is back due to your post on Weibo! It is all your fault. Why are you so idle? What was with that story? Comparing me to a kitten? Where do I look like a cat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian looked at Cheng Wei\u2019s hair standing up and thought, \u2018Isn\u2019t this like a kitten?\u2019 He looked even more like one when his hair stood up!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian listened to his machine-gun like scolding and suppressed the urge to laugh as he said, \u201cOkay, it is all my fault. I have deleted the story and the Lou Zhang combination just wanted to see the liveliness. They hold no malice towards Cat God so you don\u2019t have to worry too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence was true. The Lou Zhang combination debuted with Cheng Wei in the third season. In the same year, they played against Cat God. It was estimated that they entered the online game tonight because of curiosity.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei thought about this and his mood improved.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, if Lou Wushuang and Zhang Shaohui team up, Cat God will be in danger! I have to protect him.\u201d He quickly ran to the side of Love to Eat Braised Fish and raised his hand, prepared to act as a bodyguard.</p><br/><p>The Miracle League\u2019s number one brainless fan was really dedicated, controlling a side account to act as Cat God\u2019s bodyguard.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian helplessly looked at him and had to follow Cheng Wei to protect Cat God.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The Ghost Spirits\u2019 dormitory.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui followed his cousin to hide behind a tree and looked at the white magician. He wondered, \u201cIs that Cheng Wei?\u201d</p><br/><p>His cousin\u2019s IQ was actually working for once. Lou Wushuang felt very relieved as he nodded. \u201cThey are Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cIt seems that many people are interested in this event. Brother, shall we go and assassinate Cat God?\u201d</p><br/><p>He took a few steps forward, wanting to stab Cat God when Cheng Wei used the wide-range God\u2019s Faith. Zhang Shaohui immediately ran while spitting out, \u201cCheng Wei is simply Cat God\u2019s brainless fan. He has incredibly tight protection!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang spoke with a cold face, \u201cCan\u2019t you just hide and watch the excitement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, I will listen to you.\u201d Zhang Shaohui smiled and scratched his head. He settled down and hid behind a tree with his cousin, eyes watching the excitement.</p><br/><p>The Dark Legion had six mines and the economy instantly reversed. Many people in the camp channel gave a thumbs up. [The commander is sharp!]</p><br/><p>[The commander is too big!]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng ignored the camp channel and typed in the discussion group: [Leaders of the three large groups, report the war damage.]</p><br/><p>The Dark Legion\u2019s upper, middle and lower roads were led by the Pure Cleansing, Cheetah and Wind Colour group respectively. It was impossible for Ling Xuefeng to take care of each group so he entrusted it to the management of these guilds. As the team leaders, they commanded the three roads separately.</p><br/><p>After all, the three president vice-commanders weren\u2019t rookies and they were able to quickly understand Ling Xuefeng\u2019s meaning.</p><br/><p>Same Boat Under Wind and Rain immediately sent a message: [The third group has three chariots damaged and there are seven left. The personnel casualties are 12 groups.]</p><br/><p>Pure Cleansing\u2019s president reported next. [The second group has five chariots left and 10 groups of casualties.]</p><br/><p>Cheetah\u2019s president Ultimate Hunter typed: [The first group is similar to the second group.]</p><br/><p>The surprise attack had stolen three mines but the losses to their side were also heavy. The good thing was that these losses were within acceptable limits.</p><br/><p>The satisfied Ling Xuefeng typed: [Everyone will push the chariots and ores back under the protection of the paladins.]</p><br/><p>Since 90,000 gold was used before, there wasn\u2019t enough money to repair the castle. They had to make money as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s ideas were good but the opposite commander Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t a person to be bullied. His order had just been given when a large number of messages appeared on the camp channel: [Not good! The opposite side went straight to our stronghold!]</p><br/><p>[They are pulling the Dark Goddess! Damn, the main T is As the Name Suggests of the Food Squad.]</p><br/><p>[The Dark Goddess has lost 5% health!]</p><br/><p>[There are at least 100 groups! It is extremely crowded!]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw the information on the camp channel and inwardly felt surprised.</p><br/><p>Cat\u2019s counterattack speed simply wasn\u2019t ordinary!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The Bright Legion\u2019s counterattack was truly swift and depended entirely on the determination of the chief commander Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng had just stolen the three mines of the Bright Legion. A general commander might be confused by this sudden attack but Li Cangyu was very calm.</p><br/><p>He reacted as soon as he found out that the opposite commander was Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>-If you dare to sneak attack my mines, I will assassinate your camp\u2019s goddess!</p><br/><p>Not repairing the Dark Goddess\u2019 castle? It was a convenient way to let them enter unimpeded!</p><br/><p>The Dark Legion\u2019s chariots did cause the Bright Legion to suffer heavy casualties. However, the legion defense had one characteristic. Players who died could freely choose a resurrection point that had been occupied by their side.</p><br/><p>At the beginning, Ling Xuefeng sent people to investigate the entire map. Li Cangyu naturally wasn\u2019t idle. Once the bridges were connected, he sent 10 groups secretly into the Dark Legion\u2019s camp and forcibly took that resurrection point.</p><br/><p>As Ling Xuefeng drove the chariot to the Bright Legion\u2019s camp, Li Cangyu took the opposite side\u2019s resurrection point!</p><br/><p>[Everyone who dies, immediately choose the resurrection point of the Dark Legion to resurrect!] Li Cangyu ordered after the three mines were attacked. [Anyone who isn\u2019t dead, jump into the abyss to kill yourself. Then resurrect on the opposite site and assemble at the point I marked!]</p><br/><p>Jumping into the abyss took only three seconds and waiting to resurrect took 10 seconds.</p><br/><p>This way of gathering was much faster than groups of people walking slowly down the roads.</p><br/><p>In just half a minute, while the Dark Legion were slowly driving the ore across the bridge and returning home, hundreds of groups from the Bright Legion had already gone from the lower resurrection point to the goddess\u2019 lair!</p><br/><p>The small madman Gu Siming pulled the Dark Goddess according to Cat God\u2019s instructions.</p><br/><p>The goddess was really beautiful and the dark wings behind her were gorgeous. It was a pity that she didn\u2019t have the protection of the castles after appearing and the Bright Legion reached her unobstructed.</p><br/><p>There were no doubts about Xiao Gu\u2019s boss techniques. Once he stabilized the boss, Li Cangyu immediately ordered everyone to open fire and the goddess\u2019 blood quickly fell to 95%.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu attacked the boss while watching the timer.</p><br/><p>After all, this was the Dark Legion\u2019s base. It would be disadvantageous to fight against a large group here and Li Cangyu estimated that the opposite side\u2019s forces were about to arrive. He looked at the boss\u2019 blood volume that had fallen to 80% and didn\u2019t hesitate to order: [Don\u2019t avoid the boss\u2019 big move and collectively die. Once you die, choose the resurrection point in the centre of our castle!]</p><br/><p>The Dark Goddess\u2019 blood soon fell to 80% and a red light flashed from her black wings. Her huge wings then unfolded and countless black feathers descended from the sky in a 360 degree range. They danced and stabbed the surrounding players like swords.</p><br/><p>The black feathers swept over them, the effect of the big move looking truly gorgeous.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw this scene when he came over with a large force. Hundreds of Li Cangyu\u2019s groups died under the goddess\u2019 big move, their bodies covering the ground.</p><br/><p>Then after 10 seconds, the bodies magically disappeared\u2026</p><br/><p>They chose to resurrect back at the camp according to the commander\u2019s order.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of enemy groups suddenly attacked, decreasing the Dark Goddess\u2019 health by 20% and then collectively disappeared!</p><br/><p>This type of sneak attack was more shocking than taking three mines!</p><br/><p>You know, it was very difficult to decrease the camp boss\u2019 blood, especially after the defense castles were built. If they wanted to see the camp boss, they had to first destroy the castle, kill the castle guards and face the other forces after seeing the boss\u2026</p><br/><p>In the many years since Miracle opened, the camp boss had been killed no more than three times.</p><br/><p>Today, Li Cangyu took advantage of Ling Xuefeng\u2019s stealing the ores to quickly suicide and resurrect at the stolen resurrection point. They quickly sneaked into the Dark Goddess\u2019 lair and took 20% of the camp boss\u2019 health!</p><br/><p>It was inevitable that the Dark Legion\u2019s troops would rush back to kill them. Yet the hundreds of groups were killed directly by the boss\u2019 big moves, without a single person left behind\u2026</p><br/><p>This approach was really decisive and simply astounding!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked at the disappearing corpses and a glimmer of appreciation filled his eyes.</p><br/><p>This was Li Cangyu\u2019s command style. He wasn\u2019t willing to eat a single bit of loss.</p><br/><p>This counterattack was really fierce. The Dark Legion might have an advantage in economy but 20% of the boss\u2019 blood had been destroyed. In the later period of the war, it was necessary to be careful. If a mistake was made, Li Cangyu would directly go and kill the boss.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The guilds\u2019 management were dumbfounded when they saw this scene.</p><br/><p>In the past, the legion defense involved occupying the three mines in the early stages then use the money to build up the castle. Once the castle was repaired, make money and buy chariots and cannons\u2026</p><br/><p>Sometimes it would take two hours and the face of the camp\u2019s boss couldn\u2019t even be seen.</p><br/><p>However, today, the speed of the two commanders was so quick that the people involved couldn\u2019t recover.</p><br/><p>This started less than 40 minutes ago and the Bright Legion already had three mines stolen while the Dark Legion\u2019s boss was attacked!</p><br/><p>There were many people in both camps who gave thumbs up and praised the commanders on both sides.</p><br/><p>The league\u2019s number one brainless fan Cheng Wei was also excited and crazily filled the camp channel: [The commander is mighty and domineering! Commander, good power! Great! Commander, fighting!]</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the office of the Wind Colour team, Popular Land Under Heaven looked at his captain with a perturbed glance.</p><br/><p>Any commander would be irritable at having 20% of their goddess\u2019 blood stolen but Ling Xuefeng\u2019s expression was very calm. His eyes were full of appreciation and it was like he was happy\u2026</p><br/><p>In fact, winning or losing wasn\u2019t important. Captain Ling personally became the commander in order to fight against Cat God.</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven suddenly felt that\u2026 he understood something very important.</p><br/><p>Once Li Cangyu successfully counterattacked, he sent a message on the world channel: [Opposite commander, how about the middle group?]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng said: [I\u2019ll go back to repair the castle. Let\u2019s talk at 9 o\u2019clock.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [The activity is over at 11 o\u2019clock. Hurry and make money.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [I have more money than you.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [My boss is still full of blood.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [You\u2019re good. [Thumbs up]]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [You\u2019re not bad either. [Thumbs up.]]</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hey hey! Is it okay for the two great commanders to praise each other? Look at all the people watching!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

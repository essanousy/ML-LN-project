Promise me?</p><hr/><br/><p>The Ghost Spirits members came to the hospital to visit the captain but Lou Wushuang was still asleep. They couldn\u2019t help so Zhang Shaohui sent everyone back to the hotel, saying that he would take care of the captain and everyone could feel reassured.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until late in the evening that the sleeping Lou Wushuang finally opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>He was dizzy and confused about where he was. He was so uncomfortable that he wanted to sit up. Zhang Shaohui immediately reached out and helped help, placing the pillow behind him and letting him lean on Zhang Shaohui. Zhang Shaohui nervously wondered, \u201cYou woke up. Are you feeling better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang found his glasses and put them on. He stared at the other person before recognizing Zhang Shaohui. Then he took a deep breath and glanced around. He finally recovered his sense of reason and frowned. \u201cWhy am I in the hospital?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou passed out.\u201d Zhang Shaohui whispered. \u201cThe doctor said you are malnourished. Combined with the fever and exhaustion, your blood sugar level became low and you fainted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang was silent. In fact, he had been uncomfortable for a few days but the game was imminent. He was the captain of Ghost Spirits and couldn\u2019t take time off to see a doctor. He also stayed up late thinking of tactics, causing him to have a headache and lowering his physical strength. As for the lack of nutrition\u2026 he had a bad appetite recently and felt like he was eating wave. Strictly speaking, his appetite had been terrible since his separation from Zhang Shaohui.</p><br/><p>He originally thought he was strong enough to face all of his calmly but it turned out, he couldn\u2019t achieve true calm. In the face of Zhang Shaohui, his emotions weren\u2019t well adjusted. Every time he saw this person, his heart ached like it was being cut by a knife.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s thoughts were very chaotic during this time. He could only use work to paralyze his nerves so that he didn\u2019t think about Zhang Shaohui. The result was that he fainted of physical exhaustion\u2026</p><br/><p>It was something he didn\u2019t expect and the last result he wanted to see.</p><br/><p>He fainted and it was unknown what the reporters would write. The Ghost Spirits fans would also be worried and the team\u2019s morale would be unstable, making the next game more difficult.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang looked for his phone to send a Weibo post to reassure people but his phone wasn\u2019t in his pocket. Zhang Shaohui knew what he was looking for and explained, \u201cYour phone has no more battery so I had Ah Rong bring it back to the hotel first. I just sent a Weibo stating that the problem isn\u2019t serious. Don\u2019t worry about it and rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect Zhang Shaohui tp be quite reliable at this crucial moment. Lou Wushuang took back his hand and sat quietly on the bed.</p><br/><p>After a while, Zhang Shaohui asked cautiously, \u201cBrother, we\u2026 can we talk about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang frowned and his voice was very cold. \u201cTalk about what? Will you apologize to me again?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I, I want to say\u2026\u201d Zhang Shaohui scratched his head and carefully considered his words before making up his mind. \u201cSince we have already\u2026 already, I should take responsibility for it. I, I can\u2019t escape. Thus\u2026 I want to ask you. What exactly should I do for you to forgive me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He saw Lou Wushuang\u2019s ugly expression and Zhang Shaohui hurriedly added, \u201cYou can\u2019t do anything you want to me. You can get mad or hit me. No matter what you want, I will do it right away! Brother, can you give me another chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man stared at him with anticipation and beginning. The pathetic eyes that didn\u2019t want to be abandoned softened Lou Wushuang\u2019s heart and he couldn\u2019t say the words of rejection.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he had been too anxious this time. The incident happened after becoming drunk and it was normal for Zhang Shaohui to find it hard to accept. After all, he was a straight man\u2019s thoughts and couldn\u2019t figure it out in two or three days.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 restoring the brotherly relationship made Lou Wushuang feel awkward.</p><br/><p>Perhaps a sick person was inherently softer and the other person\u2019s expression was hard to refuse. After hesitating for a while, Lou Wushuang whispered, \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t blame you and will let it go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui was happy and immediately grabbed Lou Wushuang\u2019s hand excitedly. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang quietly pulled back his hand. Zhang Shaohui was a bit embarrassed but his heartbeat suddenly accelerated and his fingers still seemed to feel the temperature of the other party, giving Zhang Shaohui an endless aftertaste.</p><br/><p>The two people were silent for a moment. Then the drip finished and Zhang Shaohui asked the nurse to come over to change it. He also ran outside to buy a nutritious dinner and came back to eat with Lou Wushuang.</p><br/><p>The sky was dark outside and Lou Wushuang stared at the infusion bottle and asked, \u201cHow many bottles of medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui got up to check the infusion list and replied, \u201cThere are three bottles.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you go back first.\u201d Lou Wushuang told him lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I will stay here with you.\u201d Zhang Shaohui was stubborn and Lou Wushuang didn\u2019t argue again. He closed his eyes and said tiredly, \u201cThen I will sleep again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, go to sleep. I am guarding you.\u201d Zhang Shaohui helped him lie down and carefully covered him with a quilt.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After this night, the relationship between the two people obviously eased and Lou Wushuang\u2019s spirit and physical state also improved.</p><br/><p>Due to various speculation outside and Manager Lin\u2019s request, the Ghost Spirits team held a press conference in Beijing. Lou Wushuang told the public that his body had improved and he could cope with the next game. Zhang Shaohui also made it clear that he would help his brother share the work of the team.</p><br/><p>The two brothers sat in front of the reporters and the storm finally calmed down. The Ghost Spirits fans sighed with relief.</p><br/><p>All team members returned to Shenzhen the next day. Zhang Shaohui took the initiative to help his brother with the luggage. He no longer deliberately avoided Lou Wushuang and Lou Wushuang responded calmly to his questions. In the eyes of the players, the two seemed to have returned to the past.</p><br/><p>However, Zhang Shaohui knew that his own mood would never return to the past.</p><br/><p>Previously, he faced his brother and only felt admiration and respect. Now when he saw Lou Wushuang, he only thought of the scene where Lou Wushuang lay in his arms while covered in kiss marks.</p><br/><p>In the dormitory that evening, Lou Wushuang took a shower while Zhang Shaohui gazed at the figure in the bathroom through the frosted glass of the bathroom. He listened to the water sound from inside and felt something downwards.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help thinking of Lou Wushuang bathing. It must be a sexy and beautiful sight, just like what he saw on the bed when he got up that morning. Lou Wushuang\u2019s legs were long and straight, his waist wasn\u2019t too thin, his hips were round and his body was so good that people couldn\u2019t look away\u2026</p><br/><p>He was just thinking this when Lou Wushuang suddenly opened the door. He was wearing a simple white bathrobe that covered most of his body but accidentally exposed the delicate collarbone. There were crystal clear water drops\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui heard the sound of himself gulping.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang gazed at him and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s my luggage? Help me bring it to my room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zhang Shaohui actively helped him drag the luggage in.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang sat on the bed and wiped his hair. He rubbed for a while and found that Zhang Shaohui was still standing there and not leaving. He lightly asked, \u201cDo you still have something to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Zhang Shaohui\u2019s senses immediately returned and he scratched his head with embarrassment. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, cough. I will go back first. If you are uncomfortable, remember to call me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He ran out of his brother\u2019s bedroom and returned to his room in a restless mood. He opened his previous post in the forum. After so many days, the post had already sunk down. Zhang Shaohui raised his courage and posted: [I am the landlord who slept with my friend after drinking. He has forgiven me but I am always thinking and dreaming about him, like a demon. The relationship between us has eased. If he knows what I am thinking and dreaming about, will he be so angry that he wants to kill me?]</p><br/><p>The landlord who had been missing for many days came back to post, exciting the crowd. They gave him bad ideas: [Landlord, what are you waiting for? Hurry and chase him!]</p><br/><p>[Not yet, wait for the New Year!]</p><br/><p>[If you keep delaying like this, you should be careful that your friend isn\u2019t taken away!]</p><br/><p>[If it is a man, then it is easy. Don\u2019t muddy the waters and quickly go confess!]</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Many netizens scolded him for not having courage. The passersby didn\u2019t know the trust and could take nonsense. How could he confess to his brother? Was he tired of living?</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui lay in bed while thinking about Lou Wushuang accepting him. The more he thought about it, the more he knew the possibility was 0%.</p><br/><p>That night, Zhang Shaohui tossed and turned, finding it hard to sleep. The next day, he woke up with deep dark circles.</p><br/><p>Like an obsessive lover, he thought about what he should do. He wanted to be more intimate with Lou Wushuang but was worried their relationship would be ruined. This contradictory mood made him almost go crazy.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Three days later, the Ghost Spirits played their second game in Shenzhen. It was a home game and the opponent was a weak team. In this game, the Ghost Spirits won the arena and team battle, finally gaining back a bit of face.</p><br/><p>The Lou Zhang combination was still split apart. Lou Wushuang was training a newcomer while Zhang Shaohui also took a rookie who just debuted. The effect wasn\u2019t bad and Manager Lin finally let go of his worries, offering to treat them to a meal.</p><br/><p>A lovely girl came to the meal. She was Manager Lin\u2019s daughter, Lin Xiaowan and she was currently studying in the journalism department of Shenzhen University. She planned to be an e-sports reporter after graduation.</p><br/><p>She was a loyal fan of Lou Wushuang and sat beside him, asking him many questions. Lou Wushuang gave some face to the manager and patiently answered her questions. The little girl was excited and spread out her palm, asking Lou Wushuang to sign her hand.</p><br/><p>The players joked, \u201cXiaowan, our Captain Lou\u2019s signature is very precious. It will be washed off is he signs it on your hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Xiaowan smiled. \u201cI won\u2019t wash my hand for a week after going back!\u201d</p><br/><p>This girl was very lively and generous. As a member of the journalism department, her eloquence was excellent. Thanks to her, the meal was particularly lively.</p><br/><p>Manager Lin brought her because he wanted her to have more opportunities to communicate with e-sports players before her graduation. However, Zhang Shaohui was particularly upset, especially when he saw her sit next to Lou Wushuang and talking nonstop. He was so annoyed that he couldn\u2019t wait to put a seal on her mouth and bring his brother into his arms!</p><br/><p>The sourness in Zhang Shaohui\u2019s heart made him uncomfortable. He wanted to kill this Lin Xiaowan with his gaze but she had strong nerves. After getting Lou Wushuang\u2019s signature, she ran to get Zhang Shaohui\u2019s signature. She said with a smile, \u201cVice-Captain Zhang, Captain Lou signed my left hand. Can you sign my right hand? I will take a photo to remember it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui signed for her and drank two beers in a distracted manner. He couldn\u2019t become drunk after two glasses of beer but after returning, he deliberately pretended to be drunk.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang emerged from the shower and found Zhang Shaohui lying on bed, staring up at the ceiling with a dull gaze. He walked over and gently pushed Zhang Shaohui\u2019s shoulder, whispering, \u201cDid you sleep well yesterday? How can you become drunk from a few drinks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui\u2019s spirit returned and he saw Lou Wushuang\u2019s wet skin from the shower. He gulped and boldly placed his arms around Lou Wushuang\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang was unprepared and was pulled into Zhang Shaohui\u2019s arms. He was stunned and his glasses almost fell off.</p><br/><p>He struggled to get up. Zhang Shaohui tightened his arms and hugged him. He took off Lou Wushuang\u2019s glasses and stared into his eyes, whispering, \u201cBrother, am I drunk? Why am I remembering that night again? Thinking about holding you, kissing you\u2026 Don\u2019t be so close to those women okay? I have already embraced you, you can\u2019t stop me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Lou Wushuang\u2019s face was red and he couldn\u2019t help the trembling in his voice.</p><br/><p>His glasses were taken off by the other person and his vision was blurry, causing the physical touch to become extraordinarily vivid. Zhang Shaohui\u2019s arms were strong and powerful, making him unable to break free. The shocking thing was that he actually felt Zhang Shaohui\u2019s lower part standing up high and leaning against his abdomen.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang instantly froze. Zhang Shaohui noticed that the other person didn\u2019t resist and dared to kiss Lou Wushuang. The kiss was like water. He just touched the other person\u2019s lips gently before letting go.</p><br/><p>He was prepared to be slapped by Lou Wushuang. He would fall over and pretend to be drunk. Then the next day, he would wake up and pretend not to know anything.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect that after kissing Lou Wushuang, this person didn\u2019t slap him. Instead, Lou Wushuang\u2019s body softened and he fell into Zhang Shaohui\u2019s arms, his body shaking slightly.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui was stunned by his and was at a bit of a loss.</p><br/><p>A muffled voice came from his chest. \u201cAh Hui, are you drunk again? Will you remember nothing after you wake up tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>The repressed pain was clearly transferred. Lou Wushuang\u2019s trembling voice passed to Zhang Shaohui\u2019s brain, every word like a sharp thorn that broke Zhang Shaohui\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang originally didn\u2019t resist his kiss?</p><br/><p>In fact, he had long been in Lou Wushuang\u2019s heart? That\u2019s why he was so angry last time?</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go on like this anymore. I\u2019m really tired.\u201d Lou Wushuang pleaded softly, \u201cLet me go\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui listened to the other person\u2019s trembling voice and felt particularly distressed. He didn\u2019t let go and couldn\u2019t help reaching out to stroke Lou Wushuang\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang gazed at him doubtfully. After removing the glasses, his brother\u2019s eyes became wet and Zhang Shaohui finally couldn\u2019t withstand the desires in his heart. He bent his head and pressed a hard kiss against Lou Wushuang\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>This time it was no longer a light touch. He boldly pried open the teeth and delved deep into the mouth. Lou Wushuang was obviously shocked by this kiss and reflexively tried to escape, but Zhang Shaohui kept hugging him.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui\u2019s kiss was rough and reckless, the tongue licking the mouth with almost zero skill. However, this simple and straightforward kiss caused Lou Wushuang\u2019s heart to soften in an instant.</p><br/><p>He originally thought that he had to give up on this fruitless relationship. It turned out that he couldn\u2019t resist the man he had secretly been in love with for years. Zhang Shaohui\u2019s simple kiss was enough to rekindle the flames in his cold heart.</p><br/><p>Even if Zhang Shaohui was drunk this time, he still couldn\u2019t resist the warmth of his brother.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang actively moved his tongue and Zhang Shaohui immediately became excited, kissing back deeply according to the other person\u2019s inducement.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 hmm\u2026\u201d Seductive sounds emerged from Lou Wushuang\u2019s lips and Zhang Shaohui\u2019s body couldn\u2019t help heating up. He flipped their position and pushed Lou Wushuang onto the bed, kissing him even deeper.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s vision spin and once he recovered, he found that Zhang Shaohui was pressing on him and kissing him. Lou Wushuang\u2019s heart rate accelerated and he nervously held the other person\u2019s shoulders, his mouth opening to allow his brother\u2019s deep kiss.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 um\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The kiss lasted a long time until Zhang Shaohui reluctantly let go of the other party, lest they both suffocate.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s lips were wet from the kiss and the touch of redness on his face was particularly moving under the illumination of the lights.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui gentle stroked the red face and spoke in a hoarse voice, \u201cDo you know? I don\u2019t want to call you Brother anymore. I want to kiss you, hold you, do that type of thing with you like last time. I want you to become my person that no one else can take away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought this person was drunk again. He didn\u2019t expect Zhang Shaohui to speak so clearly. Lou Wushuang stiffened and he glanced at the other person with surprise. \u201cYou\u2026 what are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui clung to Lou Wushuang, rubbing his head against Lou Wushuang\u2019s neck as he requested seriously, \u201cDon\u2019t be my brother, be my wife. I will be good to you. I swear, I will never hurt you in this life. I will love you and protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Lou Wushuang couldn\u2019t respond for a long time.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui glanced at him and boldly spoke. \u201cIf you are angry, take a knife to kill me. If you can\u2019t bear to kill me, promise me! I miss you so much that I dream of you every night and I\u2019m going crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have these thoughts about you. I\u2019m a bastard and a beast\u2026\u201d Zhang Shaohui whispered. \u201cEven so, I can\u2019t control myself. I really want to kiss you, hug you, watch you every day\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang didn\u2019t know how he felt. The person he had been in love with for many years suddenly confessed to him. It was like a lottery ticket worth millions of yuan suddenly falling from the sky, so that he couldn\u2019t believe it.</p><br/><p>However, the burning temperature of the person holding him and the familiar voice in his ear told Lou Wushuang that this wasn\u2019t a dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you promise?\u201d Zhang Shaohui asked seriously. \u201cI want to be together with you, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>After making sure that he wasn\u2019t drunk and talking nonsense, Lou Wushuang couldn\u2019t help blushing. He endured the excitement and nodded, whispering, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui thought he heard wrong. He raised his head and saw Lou Wushuang\u2019s red face underneath him. In an instant, ecstasy poured into his heart. Zhang Shaohui hugged Lou Wushuang as hard as possible and casually kissed his face a few times, as happy as winning the lottery. \u201cThat\u2019s great! I won\u2019t call you Brother in the future. Is it okay if I call you Wushuang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s blush deepened. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The name embarrassed him but he couldn\u2019t ignore the hint of sweetness in his heart.</p><br/><p>His silly younger brother finally opened up and changed their relationship. They would still work together, supporting each other as they moved forward.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang thought this and took the initiative to hold Zhang Shaohui and the other side hugged back with more strength.</p><br/><p>After years of secret love, he was finally able to get this fool\u2019s response. This happiness was very simply. Zhang Shaohui was willing to stay with him and be his lover, making Lou Wushuang content.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

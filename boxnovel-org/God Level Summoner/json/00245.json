The four girls met to go to the nearby flower market. Chu Yan, Zhu Qingyue, Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan also came to the open-air swimming pool and the four people played poker at a table. Jiang Xu and Bai Xuan came over to chat with Cheng Wei. Meanwhile, Xie Shurong joined Zhuo Hang and Tan Shitian in the basketball game.</p><br/><p>Night here was particularly cool and sitting next to the pool while playing cards was very pleasant. It would be perfect with a few bottles of beer but Captain Li Cangyu had completely prohibited alcohol. Everyone knew that top-ranking experts from various countries were waiting for them at the World Competition and didn\u2019t dare drink alcohol.</p><br/><p>This was the last relaxing night before the training started.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw Cheng Wei\u2019s listless face and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cXiao Wei, are you thinking about Cat God?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei yawned and said, \u201cCat God is still the most handsome basketball player.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan joked, \u201cYour Captain Tan will be hurt once he hears this.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Tan Shitian suddenly turned around and smiled at Cheng Wei. Cheng Wei thought of the scene where he had been kissed in the hotel and his cheeks turned red. He immediately shifted the direction of his gaze.</p><br/><p>The three men playing basketball came over and sat down. Cheng Wei saw Tan Shitian sitting next to him and immediately jumped up. \u201cI will go back first. There are many mosquitoes here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he ran away like his butt was on fire.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at the back that disappeared as fast as the wind and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cXiao Wei seems to still have a child\u2019s heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled. \u201cHe only knows how to play games and watch games. He almost never communicates with the outside world. Nothing can be done without any experience. Still, I think he has a good personality.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them were chatting when Xie Shurong suddenly opened his white vest and revealed the back of his waist to Bai Xuan. \u201cVice-Captain Bai, i was just bitten by a mosquito. It is so big\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had a headache as he looked at Xie Shurong\u2019s wait. \u201cAren\u2019t you wearing clothes? How did it bite your waist? A mosquito finding such a place\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong replied innocently, \u201cPerhaps the mosquitoes think the meat at my waist is delicious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at the idiot. \u201cMosquitoes suck blood, not meat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know, it was a mistake.\u201d Xie Shurong frowned slightly. \u201cIt is really itchy to be bitten by such a big mosquito.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan told him, \u201cGo back and place oil on it. Then it won\u2019t itch.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Everyone stayed at the pool and talked until 10 o\u2019clock. Once Xie Shurong returned to his room, he went to the bathroom and took a shower. Then he wrapped a towel around himself, brought out a bottle of oil essence and presented his back to Bai Xuan. \u201cVice-Captain Bai, help me. I can\u2019t see the position of the bite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw the big bite on his waist and carefully applied the oil.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong felt Bai Xuan\u2019s fingers gently moving across his skin. He couldn\u2019t help feeling something down there and once the other person finished, he immediately turned to face Bai Xuan, his eyes shining. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The result of this movement caused the towel to fall to the ground. Bai Xuan was surprised to see that Xie Shurong wasn\u2019t wearing anything underneath!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked away with embarrassment. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wear something before coming out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled shamelessly. \u201cI just wanted you to look at my body to earn more points.\u201d</p><br/><p>His thick skin was unmatched. Before Bai Xuan could say anything to him, Xie Shurong took one step forward. Bai Xuan had to move back. As a result, he stumbled against the bed and was forced to sit down on it.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong took the opponent to place his arms on the bed, encircling Bai Xuan. He whispered, \u201cI have a really good figure. You can take a look and come to a conclusion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s face reddened and he reached out to push Ah Shu away. \u201cDon\u2019t mess around.\u201d</p><br/><p>As a result, his fingers touched strong muscles. Due to his shower, the water vapor on his skin made his chest look extraordinarily smooth\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan took back his hand like it was burnt but Xie Shurong gently grabbed his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xuan, I really like you.\u201d Xie Shurong stared into his eyes and spoke earnestly. \u201cI know I\u2019m not your type and I can\u2019t change my personality for you. However, emotional things are never certain. Why do you have to look for the mature type? Why don\u2019t you try another type? I will be a good boyfriend\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan sat stiffly upright. Ah Shu was younger than him and his posture made Bai Xuan embarrassed. Bai Xuan\u2019s cheeks became hotter.</p><br/><p>He tried to push the other person away, only for Xie Shurong to put out his tongue and lick Bai Xuan\u2019s ear. \u201cWhy won\u2019t you try it? You don\u2019t hate me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was about to say, \u2018How can this thing be tried casually?\u2019 only for his lips to become warm. Xie Shurong actually kissed me!</p><br/><p>It was a feather soft touch of a kiss.</p><br/><p>He was robbed of his first kiss by a guy younger than him! Bai Xuan\u2019s entire face turned red and he pushed away the other person. The always good-natured person exclaimed with wide eyes, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like you and want to kiss you.\u201d XIe Shurong said. \u201cYou don\u2019t feel sick, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He really wasn\u2019t sick from the kiss. Ah Shu just lightly touched his lips and the kiss gave off a youthful and sunny feeling.</p><br/><p>However, the thought of falling in love with someone younger than him made Bai Xuan\u2019s mind hurt.</p><br/><p>He raised his head to refute the other person, only to meet serious eyes. \u201cI have said it many times but I still want to say it. I like you. I\u2019m serious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never liked a person like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am younger than you. There is no way to change this but I will take care of you and strive to become a gentle and reliable boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know I can\u2019t do it if you don\u2019t give me a chance?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe six months agreement is coming to an end soon. I can only hope that you will give me a chance, as if receiving a free sample. If it doesn\u2019t suit, you can return it at any time.\u201d Ah Shu gently hugged Bai Xuan\u2019s waist and placed his head on Bai Xuan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cIf you want to break up with me, I will stop pestering you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The sentences that came one after another made it really hard for him to refuse. He knew it was normal for people to fall in love and break up in a few years. Love at first sight was rare and most partners had to develop their feelings.</p><br/><p>However, if they really broke up, wouldn\u2019t the damage to the other person be bigger?</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was confused and Xie Shurong told him, \u201cYou can rest assured that as long as you give me the opportunity, I will hold it firmly. If you really can\u2019t like me after we get together, I won\u2019t complain anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me a chance, okay?\u201d Xie Shurong\u2019s voice was extraordinarily gentle.</p><br/><p>After a long silence, Bai Xuan sighed. \u201cFine\u2026 I will give you another six months. Let\u2019s try it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong excitedly stretched out his arms and hugged Bai Xuan. He picked up Bai Xuan and turned him around twice. \u201cGreat! This is great! Starting from today, I am Bai Xuan\u2019s boyfriend!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep your voice down! The captain is just opposite from here!\u201d Bai Xuan hurriedly covered Ah Shu\u2019s mouth. He suddenly regretted his decision just now. If he actually fell in love with the childish Ah Shu, wouldn\u2019t his IQ be pulled lower?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

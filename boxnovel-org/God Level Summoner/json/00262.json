This might be a friendly game but it will be humiliating if we lose too badly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he became serious, the few new people around him started acting. Big moves filled the sky and aimed at Xiao Han. As a result, Xiao Han used Combat Stealth like Qin Mo and all the skills missed!</p><br/><p>\u201cKill the archer!\u201d Li Cangyu reminded them.</p><br/><p>At this time, Zhang Shaohui was already behind the archer and killed her!</p><br/><p>The head ratio became 3:2 again and Kim Yoonhee shouted, \u201cWatch out for the snake\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish, she saw the blood snake that Qin Mo placed under the remote\u2019s feet suddenly twist its body and wrap around the white magician\u2014Blood Snake\u2019s Spit!</p><br/><p>This was the big move of the blood snake. The person tangled up in the snake couldn\u2019t move, they would lose a lot of blood and three layers of bleeding would apply. This skill caused the white magician\u2019s blood to fall to 30%\u2026</p><br/><p>The black magician had a blood spider at his feet. The spider made him unable to move and he also had three layers of bleeding applied to him.</p><br/><p>Shim Yoocheol looked back to see that the four people who survived in the South Korean team didn\u2019t have much blood left. The even worst thing was that all fall people had three layers of bleeding on them. The blood lost in 10 seconds wasn\u2019t a joke!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The players watching the game couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cThis summoner\u2019s awareness is excellent!\u201d</p><br/><p>South Korea\u2019s captain Park Joonseo smiled and commented, \u201cThe two line operation is very skilled. He should be Ling Xuefeng\u2019s apprentice, the talented newcomer Qin Mo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis style is calm, completely different from the American team\u2019s Jack.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe applied a bleeding state to everyone\u2019s body, making it convenient for his teammates to find opportunities to take heads. It seems that the Chinese team has thoroughly studied the death racing mode.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the group of people discussed it, the two sides exchanged a wave of skills. Zhang Shaohui lurked behind the white magician after killing the archers. The black magician used Dark Fear on Zhang Shaohui and the four Korean members joined forces to kill Zhang Shaohui.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han and Qin Mo didn\u2019t have much blood left and it would be hard for them to face four people, but Li Cangyu ordered, \u201cContinue to fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had them continue to test how the two little princes would cooperate in the disadvantageous situation.</p><br/><p>Facts proved that the two small apprentices were just as connected as their masters. In the face of a 2v4 situation, they weren\u2019t afraid. It was because the four people of the South Korean team were in a residual blood state, especially the white magician Zhang Shaohui had just attacked. It would be a waste if they didn\u2019t take his head.</p><br/><p>However, they must be careful not to be controlled by the other side at the same time. Otherwise, the terrible attack power of the other side was likely to take their lives in one wave.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo cleverly stood in place and used the death knight to interfere with the other side, while Xiao Han moved flexibly around him!</p><br/><p>From the perspective of looking down from a high point, Qin Mo was like a fixed point while Xiao Han was a fast-swinging pointer. The two people moved quietly in a formation that was like a \u2018clock.\u2019 Qin Mo referred to where Xiao Han was and they moved lightning fast!</p><br/><p>Xiao Han first aimed his dagger at the white magician, successfully killing the bloody white magician. Then he detoured around the black magician and used the violent combo of Back Stab and Death Strangulation!</p><br/><p>The remaining three members of the Korean team were blinded by these actions but Shim Yoocheol wasn\u2019t a rookie. After seeing the cooperation between the two of them, he rushed towards Qin Mo and killed the death knight.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xiao Han unleashed a set of crits on the other side\u2019s black magician.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo flashed behind a reef and decisively used Blood Bat Festival!</p><br/><p>The bats flew towards the black magician and the black magician disabled by Xiao Han had his blood emptied.</p><br/><p>Shim Yoocheol took care of Qin Mo and turned to kill Xiao Han, only to find that the other person had disappeared into the chaotic reefs and could no longer be found!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng glanced at each other, appreciation in their eyes.</p><br/><p>Despite the extreme disadvantage of 2v4, they could think of the \u2018clock walking\u2019 formation that relied on Qin Mo\u2019s remote control and Xiao Han\u2019s assassination to successfully kill two residual blood opponents. The Xiao Han could escape with Qin Mo\u2019s help. The cooperation between the two little guys was becoming higher and higher.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han might\u2019ve managed to kill the white magician because Zhang Shaohui removed most of the other person\u2019s blood but Qin Mo\u2019s grasp of the overall situation and Xiao Han\u2019s decisiveness and senses made Li Cangyu feel appreciation.</p><br/><p>After this exchange, the headcount ratio of China VS South Korea became 5:4.</p><br/><p>Kim Yoonhee of the Korean team saw this and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cThis assassin\u2019s ability to seize opportunities is very strong. Is he Li Cangyu\u2019s apprentice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shim Yoocheol shrugged helplessly. \u201cIt seems that the Chinese team has an apprentice group as well as the masters! They aren\u2019t easy to deal with!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other three newcomers didn\u2019t dare speak. Today, the lineup of the South Korean team consisted of two great gods, Shim Yoocheol and Kim Yoonhee bringing three talented newcomers who just debuted this season. They assembled the lineup and didn\u2019t consider any special tactics. The gap between heads had been narrowed but they might not necessarily win.</p><br/><p>The captain Park Joonseo made a sensible judgment. The blood kin assassin and summoner should be fixed partners.</p><br/><p>If they weren\u2019t fixed partners, it would be impossible to use the clock coordination.</p><br/><p>The performance of the two teenagers surprised him. This degree of surprise was no less than when he saw the elf summoner Li Cangyu at the Carnival yesterday. It seemed that the Chinese team was a strong team of crouching tigers, hidden dragons. At least 70% to 80% of the American team\u2019s strength could be inferred. However, there were many players on the Chinese team hadn\u2019t been heard of, making him feel unfathomable\u2026</p><br/><p>Park Joonseo bowed his head and thought for a moment before saying, \u201cYoonhee, make a quick decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kim Yoonhee heard this and nodded decisively. \u201cConcentrate on the red resurrection point and directly open a group battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>The resurrection points in death racing were also recovery points. Bloody players could be restored to their initial state of full blood at the resurrection point. The Korean team members had just returned to the resurrection point when they saw\u2026 the Chinese team\u2019s players waiting there!</p><br/><p>Kim Yoonhee felt bad but it was too late to withdraw!</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was killed first. After resurrecting, he waited for Cat God\u2019s instructions. He had long prepared his big move and the moment the Korean team arrived, he cast a skill to control them\u2014Holy Seal!</p><br/><p>The three people of the South Korean team were set in place and were helplessly hit by a wave of big skills!</p><br/><p>The three players who just died needed 10 seconds to resurrect. Once they resurrected after 10 seconds, the two players who came to support them had already died.</p><br/><p>If the residual blood members continued to choose this resurrection point, they still needed to wait 10 seconds.</p><br/><p>This was a beautiful time difference battle!</p><br/><p>The commander of the opposite side had obviously calculated the resurrection time of each Korean member. In addition, the disappeared Xiao Han came to the resurrection point in advance and waited for an opportunity. The South Korean team chose this resurrection point and completely fell into Li Cangyu\u2019s trap.</p><br/><p>Kim Yoonhee used Death Arrow Rain to successfully remove the residual blood Xiao Han but the gap between heads could no longer be overcome\u2026</p><br/><p>The Chinese team finally won the death racing game with a 10:8 score!</p><br/><p>The captain of the Korean team gracefully gave a row of thumbs up.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu returned the thumbs up.</p><br/><p>For the two captains who weren\u2019t good at English, expressing their emotions with emojis was also a method!</p><br/><p>The game ended and the training room filled with cheers. Cheng Wei stood up excitedly, \u201cHahaha, we won! We won against the Korean team!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang watched Cheng Wei and said lightly, \u201cThe tactical level of the other side\u2019s woman isn\u2019t very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui scratched his head and admitted, \u201cWell, we have the captain sitting here. It would definitely be different.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis game is just a mutual exploration. There is no need to worry about it.\u201d Li Cangyu spoke calmly. \u201cThe commander of the Korean team isn\u2019t Kim Yoonhee. There is no need to feel proud about winning in this game. We have to keep preparing for the group stage match against Australia.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone agreed with the captain\u2019s statement. In this game, no one played to their true level. This was a casual game and there was no need to care about winning or losing.</p><br/><p>The excited Cheng Wei calmed down. He stood next to Tan Shitian but kept looking at Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu kept on speaking. \u201cSince everyone has come to the training room, let\u2019s discuss the first opponent and see how the match will be played.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took out a long-prepared USB flash drive and turned on the projection. \u201cI will introduce you to the style of the Australian team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen was speechless. This PPT was made by Captain Ling!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

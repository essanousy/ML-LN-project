He originally prepared many lines to persuade Xie Shurong to join the team while eating tonight. He didn\u2019t expect Xie Shurong\u2019s personality to be so refreshing that he would join when he came to the door.</p><br/><p>He took the contract. Although there was a bunch of English words that couldn\u2019t be fully understood, he could infer from some keywords that this was the agreement between Xie Shurong and the ICE Club to terminate their agreement. Now that he had this contract, Xie Shurong was free.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was in a good mood as he patted Xie Shurong\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cLet\u2019s talk while we eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three people sat at the dinner table. Xie Shurong looked at the delicious food in front of him and almost drooled. Steamed fish, sweet and sour ribs, vegetarian fried bamboo shoots, braised eggplant, spicy tofu\u2026 he ate so much half-cooked steak every day that he felt like vomiting. Now that he saw Bai Xuan\u2019s authentic home-cooked dishes, he didn\u2019t know what to say.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu handed him chopsticks. \u201cCome taste the craftsmanship of Chef Bai and you won\u2019t regret joining our team.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan said, \u201cDon\u2019t listen to that old cat bragging. I just casually cooked a few things and don\u2019t know if it will suit your taste.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong picked up the chopsticks and tasted the food. He was immediately moved as he stared at Bai Xuan. \u201cIt is too delicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Vice-Captain Bai\u2019s cooking was well-deserving of praise. It was worth joining the team just for these dishes!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s eyes swept over the table. He found the target and quickly put the plate of fish in front of him. He bowed his head and ate like he was afraid someone would steal it. Xie Shurong was more interested in the sweet and sour ribs and couldn\u2019t stop eating them.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at these two men who were like hungry ghosts, burying their heads and desperately eating the meal, and couldn\u2019t help smiling. He sat opposite them and slowly ate.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s dishes were too delicious that Xie Shurong was busy eating and didn\u2019t have time to speak.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was also very hungry after playing the game all day. He quickly finished the steamed fish in front of him then went for the braised eggplant.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan felt that the style of this team would become very strange in the future.</p><br/><p>Under Li Cangyu\u2019s leadership, would the Canglan team become a \u2018foodie camp?\u2019</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Once the dishes on the table were cleared away by the three men, Xie Shurong wiped his mouth and looked at Bai Xuan. \u201cI haven\u2019t eaten such delicious food in a long time. Vice-Captain Bai, can I continue to come here tomorrow to eat dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied quickly, \u201cCome, you are welcome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people came to an agreement and Bai Xuan had no way to refuse these two foodies. He turned away to wash a plate of fruit. Li Cangyu and Xie Shurong reluctantly left the dining room, sitting down on the sofa in the living room and chatting while eating fruit.</p><br/><p>\u201cA\u2019Shu, you decided to join my team so quickly. Is there a particular reason?\u201d Li Cangyu asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought about it carefully and realized that Cat God is right. I don\u2019t want to go back to the Flying Feathers team. In addition, the other strong teams in China don\u2019t lack swordsmen and many teams have their own tactical style. It will be very difficult for me to join their main lineup so it is better for me to follow Cat God, who is starting from scratch.\u201d Xie Shurong explained seriously.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu patted him on the shoulder and smiled. \u201cThis is the truth. It is good that you can figure it out so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong asked, \u201cBy the way, haven\u2019t you been away from Miracle for almost three years? I thought you had forgotten how to play an elf summoner. I hadn\u2019t expected that while doing the bounty mission with you today, your gameplay would still be so sharp!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cMany things aren\u2019t easy to forget.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was startled and several emotions filled his heart.</p><br/><p>Cat God was right. Some things were rooted in the heart and wouldn\u2019t be so easy to forget.</p><br/><p>Just as he left Flying Feathers and joined a foreign club rather than give up playing his swordsman, Li Cangyu had also been thinking about his elf summoner.</p><br/><p>They had a common dream when they were young.</p><br/><p>Due to a variety of reasons, these dreams weren\u2019t realized but that didn\u2019t mean they were forgotten.</p><br/><p>Three years had passed and many things changed.</p><br/><p>Strong teams and masters in the Miracle League were like clouds. It might seem bold to want to beat them all but how would they know if they didn\u2019t try?</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong couldn\u2019t help being excited thanks to Li Cangyu\u2019s firm gaze.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and stretched out a hand. \u201cFrom today onwards, we are teammates. We will work side by side to beat Miracle together.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were very calm, as if he was saying, \u201cToday we will eat rice.\u201d This calm tone and eyes with no hesitation showed how determined this man was.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong reached out and shook his hand tightly. \u201cThen Captain, let\u2019s go back together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help feeling moved as he watched the scene of the two people shaking hands.</p><br/><p>Putting aside Xie Shurong\u2019s past pursuit of him, Bai Xuan acknowledged Xie Shurong\u2019s abilities.</p><br/><p>In the third season, the Miracle League expanded the size of the teams and improved the treatment of professional players. This led to a large influx of experts into the league. Many of the rookies who debuted that year were now vice-captains or had strength suitable for the major teams. The evaluation of newcomers was a score that senior judges of Miracle created based on the players\u2019 various data.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t easy to win awards at all.</p><br/><p>In the third season where so many experts emerged, Xie Shurong managed to win the award for the most potential. He had the halo of the championship team, Flying Feathers, and his own strength wasn\u2019t weak. His kill rate in the arena and group battles was in the top five of the league and his momentum was almost the same as the powerful Ling Xuefeng, Li Cangyu and others.</p><br/><p>In addition, he played for the American ICE Club for several years. After this period of tempering, he had become a mature and stable young man. His sharp spirit had been honed and his fingers were more stable, making his swordsmanship frightening!</p><br/><p>To be able to recruit such a strong teammate, Bai Xuan was really happy for Li Cangyu and himself.</p><br/><p>The Canglan team once lacked strong teammates so this felt really good!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cDo the two of you want to shake hands as well?\u201d Li Cangyu suggested to Xie Shurong. \u201cIn the field, you used to always chase our vice-captain but now the task of protecting him will be given to you. Is this okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no problem.\u201d Xie Shurong looked up and smiled at Bai Xuan. \u201cIs the vice-captain still angry with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019m not that stingy.\u201d Bai Xuan smiled back. \u201cI just think that you have grown very quickly. You previously only reached my shoulder and now you are half a head taller than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>It felt like the small sapling in his memories had instantly grown into a towering tree.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong looked at Bai Xuan\u2019s confused expression and suddenly felt that this Vice-Captain Bai was somewhat cute.</p><br/><p>When they weren\u2019t on the same team, Xie Shurong only knew that Bai Xuan was a healer with a mild temperament, steady techniques and good looks. Now that they had closer contact, he found that the vague player in his memories was becoming flesh and blood.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan would smile, become angry, be confused..</p><br/><p>There were many vivid expressions on his face.</p><br/><p>The key thing was that all his dishes were super delicious. Bai Xuan was the team\u2019s most excellent milk dad!</p><br/><p>At the very least, his stomach would be blessed.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was in a very good mood as he thought this.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the way A\u2019Shu, you accompanied us all afternoon in the game. Wasn\u2019t there team training?\u201d Li Cangyu realized the key problem and couldn\u2019t help feeling curious. \u201cShouldn\u2019t it be the regular season for the US side of the Miracle Professional League?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have two days off.\u201d Xie Shurong explained. \u201cThe first round just finished and we will start the second round of regular games in a week.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was like this.\u201d Li Cangyu paused. \u201cHow do you think the level of the teams here are compared to domestically?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe overall strength is similar to domestic first-tier teams but the tactical thinking is far worse.\u201d Xie Shurong paused and said, \u201cOh yes, the vice-captain of the ICE Club is the blood kin summoner Jack Josh. Have you heard of this person?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had naturally heard this person\u2019s name. This person was said to be the world\u2019s strongest blood kin summoner but Li Cangyu was unsure of his strength since they hadn\u2019t personally fought.</p><br/><p>In the summoner class, in addition to the American blood skin summoner, there was also a Chinese player who boarded the world\u2019s leaderboard. It was the demon summoner and captain of the Wind Colour team, Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought this and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cYou have also fought with Ling Xuefeng. How would you compare their strengths?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCompare him to Captain Ling?\u201d Xie Shurong touched his chin as he thought about it before making a seriously evaluation. \u201cThey are both dark type summoners but Captain Ling\u2019s gameplay is very calm and he will give opponents a strong sense of oppression. Jack\u2019s style is more violent and bloody. The two people\u2019s styles are completely different.\u201d Xie Shurong smiled and said, \u201cIf you come back, the elf summoner\u2019s agile movements and quick change of pets will definitely shine in front of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Li Cangyu replied very honestly.</p><br/><p>He believed that his level wasn\u2019t any worse than these famous summoners and was looking forward to the day he faced them. But it was too early to go straight to the World Competition\u2026 he hadn\u2019t even formed a team yet!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan heard this and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cAre foreign healers different from domestic ones?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir healing styles are similar but many people in the United States play a human priest. Isn\u2019t it relatively rare in China?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, domestic healers tend to play the angel race.\u201d Bai Xuan sat opposite him and analyzed it carefully. \u201cThe angel priest has the highest healing volume but weak defense. A terran healer has medium healing and stronger defense, making it more suitable for a protracted war. However, in a situation where the combat pressure on the field is very high, I think the output of a healer is more useful. It would be useless if the healer\u2019s teammates died.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong saw his serious expression and couldn\u2019t help agreeing. \u201cVice-Captain Bai is right.\u201d</p><br/><p>The recognized Bai Xuan smiled with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong suddenly found that when this man smiled, his eyes curved and his gentle appearance was very good. He almost looked like\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was called a first-class healer in Miracle. Xie Shurong still remembered that when chasing Bai Xuan in the game, Bai Xuan might\u2019ve lost blood but he could hide from Xie Shurong\u2019s sword for a long time, like a cockroach. Bai Xuan\u2019s movements were very flexible.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t expect that they would one day become teammates.</p><br/><p>Cat God and Bai Xuan, a powerful remote output and a powerful healer. In addition, there was the melee swordsman with a fast attack. Xie Shurong knew very well that this team wouldn\u2019t be easily trampled on like the previous FTD team.</p><br/><p>In the future, everyone would fight side by side to kill their opponents!</p><br/><p>\u2018Therefore, Vice-Captain Bai, we should change roles. When I come to protect you, don\u2019t reflexively avoid me. It is embarrassing!\u2019</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan found that Xie Shurong was staring at him and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhat are you looking at? Do you want a real life PK?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled. \u201cI don\u2019t dare do that. You are the vice-captain, I will listen to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked satisfied and pointed to the plate of fruit on the table. \u201cGo to the refrigerator and cut me an orange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Xie Shurong immediately took the plate and started cutting the fruit.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help smiling when he saw this scene. \u201cA\u2019Shu often bullied you in the arena and now you can finally bully him back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at Xie Shurong\u2019s busy figure and couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cIt feels really good!\u201d</p><hr/><br/><p>The author has something to say:</p><br/><p>[Small Theater]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong: Vice-Captain Bai who I chased in those years is trying to bully me? How are things so broken?</p><br/><p>Crowd: Throw him down and eat him.</p><br/><p>A\u2019Shu who has been waiting for a long time and finally got a chance to pounce on Vice-Captain Bai. Just as he bent down to kiss, Bai Xuan suddenly flexibly escaped.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong: \u2026What are you hiding from?</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan: It is a reflex ^_^</p><br/><p>Gong Ling continues to play countdown to his appearance\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

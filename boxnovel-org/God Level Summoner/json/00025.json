He smiled and said to the players, \u201cHurry up and pack up your things. Let\u2019s go eat at noon, I will treat you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to the influence of Captain Tan, the other Time members didn\u2019t show frustrated expressions after losing the game. Instead, they excitedly said, \u201cThe league will start the holiday tomorrow. Captain Tan, do you want to go sing karaoke after eating?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian asked, \u201cYou want to go to KTV?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course.\u201d Some members laughed. \u201cCaptain Tan, sing and wash our ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled in agreement. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll book a room and we will sing songs all night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone cheered except for Cheng Wei, who bowed his head with a sullen expression. \u201cYou go sing K, I won\u2019t go since I can\u2019t sing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei could only sing out of tune. This wasn\u2019t a secret in the Miracle League.</p><br/><p>It happened at the party for the end of the third season. Cheng Wei had won the newcomer award and was encouraged to sing. He picked up the microphone and sang \u2018Grandma\u2019s Penghu Bay\u2019 that everyone was familiar with. All the captains made a \u201c\u2026\u201d expression.</p><br/><p>Time\u2019s old captain Xu Luo privately commented on Cheng Wei\u2019s singing. \u201cThe lyrics are familiar but the tune is Xiao Wei\u2019s own adaptation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s signing was so out of tune that it didn\u2019t even have the fundamental tune.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Tan Shitian\u2019s singing was unique in the league. The low and gentle tone was very good to hear and he was also good at playing guitar. His impromptu guitar playing was at the level of a professional and every time there was a big party, he would be pushed on stage to wash out their ears.</p><br/><p>In the past, Cheng Wei would be very active in playing with everyone whenever the Time team went to KTV. He was a lively and cheerful person who loved excitement. He didn\u2019t mind other people\u2019s jokes whenever he sang.</p><br/><p>Today he didn\u2019t want to go and it clearly wasn\u2019t because he couldn\u2019t sing. He was just in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian saw him hanging his head and couldn\u2019t help gently pulling Cheng Wei\u2019s wrist. \u201cXiao Wei, it is normal to win and lose in a game. Don\u2019t take it to heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Cheng Wei was silent, his mood a bit complicated.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei knew very well that Time\u2019s loss in today\u2019s battle was completely because of him. Unexpectedly, Tan Shitian didn\u2019t blame him and actually comforted him\u2026 Cheng Wei would feel better off if he was scolded.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s mind was still confused by what Ling Xuefeng said.</p><br/><p>Captain Ling had said, \u201cSome people don\u2019t need your help when they fall down.\u201d Was this telling him not to meddle with Cat God? Should he just stand by and watch as Cat God suffered so many twists and turns? In addition, Tan Shitian didn\u2019t agree to let Cat God come to the Time team. Why were these people so indifferent when Cat God was in trouble?</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei didn\u2019t understand. He only felt that his head hurt badly, like sharp needles were piercing his brain.</p><br/><p>Last night, he had been so busy thinking that he couldn\u2019t sleep. When he woke up this morning, he felt like he was walking on cotton and it was difficult to concentrate when he was in the game. He really didn\u2019t want to go to the team gathering.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei looked back at Tan Shitian\u2019s worried eyes and shook off his hand. \u201cI\u2019m not feeling well. I will return to the team first.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, regardless of his team member\u2019s doubtful eyes, he carried his keyboard bag and turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian looked at his leaving figure and couldn\u2019t help frowning slightly.</p><br/><p>Lu Xiao asked with confusion, \u201cWhat happened with Vice-Captain today? Isn\u2019t it just losing one game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Time had lost before. In the past, whenever he lost, Cheng Wei would feel flustered but never depressed. Instead, he would form a fist and vow, \u201cNext time I will kill them! I will definitely win next time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Today he was completely smashed like an eggplant and had a depressed appearance. Wasn\u2019t this completely unlike Cheng Wei\u2019s character?</p><br/><p>The players looked at the captain with great suspicion. Tan Shitian, who knew the inside story, smiled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t gossip. The vice-captain didn\u2019t sleep well last night. He had a cold and was uncomfortable. The matter of singing K will be pushed to the day after tomorrow. Today, I will invite everyone to eat first.\u201d</p><br/><p>A party didn\u2019t mean much without their lively vice-captain so the members immediately agreed with Tan Shitian\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian took the players to a restaurant near the stadium for lunch. After eating, he specifically packed a dish that Cheng Wei loved to eat and brought it back.</p><br/><p>As he returned to the club, he almost crashed into a man while entering. It was Liang Haibin, captain of the Huaxia Club\u2019s Wulin Branch.</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Liang.\u201d Tan Shitian stopped him. \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the captains of the Wulin and Miracle branches of the Huaxia Club, Tan Shitian and Liang Haibin were equal. Their training rooms were separated but they would often meet in the dining room when having lunch and would occasionally exchange tactical ideas. Thus, they were very familiar with each other.</p><br/><p>The older Liang Haibin looked at him with confusion. \u201cXiao Tan, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much do you know about Li Cangyu?\u201d Tan Shitian asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cCat God?\u201d Liang Haibin thought about it seriously. \u201cThe Canglan team isn\u2019t a first-class team on the Wulin Side. They always lost in the first round of playoffs. However, Cat God\u2019s personal ability is very strong and he has a high percentage of wins in the arena. I heard yesterday that Canglan was disbanding. Manager Li wanted to invite Cat God to join our team. The strange thing is that the Wulin League said that Cat God\u2019s information has already been secretly transferred.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe information was secretly transferred?\u201d Tan Shitian was a bit surprised. \u201cDo you know which team he went to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other side asked for secrecy so I don\u2019t know.\u201d Liang Haibin paused before saying, \u201cMy guess is that the biggest possibility is the Dragon Warriors team. This is very like Liu Chuan\u2019s style. He is part of the E-sports League so transferring a player\u2019s data is very convenient for him. Not to mention he has always appreciated Cat God and Cat God\u2019s play style is consistent with the lineup of the Dragon Warriors team.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt makes sense.\u201d Tan Shitian felt thoughtful. \u201cThen Cat God will continue to play in the Wulin League?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Liang Haibin couldn\u2019t help feeling curious. \u201cWhy are you suddenly asking about this person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, the reason is Xiao Wei.\u201d Tan Shitian said with a smile. \u201cHe has some relationship with Cat God.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Liang Haibin nodded. \u201cSpeaking of Xiao Wei, I just saw him coming back alone and he didn\u2019t look good. What\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe probably isn\u2019t feeling well so I\u2019ll go check on him. Captain Liang, you must be busy.\u201d Tan Shitian said goodbye to Liang Haibin and headed towards the dorms.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Hui, the manager of the Huaxia Club, loved e-sports. After earning a lot of money in Wulin, he set up the MIracle team and recruited many talented players. His business philosophy was very mature, allowing the Time team to win the championship in the first season. Over the past very years, the Time team was among the top teams in the league and the results were very stable.</p><br/><p>The Huaxia Club was the first comprehensive club in China to develop across two games, Wulin and Miracle.</p><br/><p>Manager Li was serious but he was very good to players. The salaries were high and the bonuses were also very generous. The accommodations, food and training room conditions of the team were first class. The club\u2019s dorms were all in a small apartment-style with two rooms and there was a person responsible for cleaning.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian was only six months older than Cheng Wei. From his debut, he had lived in the same dormitory as Cheng Wei.</p><br/><p>He took out the key and opened the door to the dorm room. There was no one in the living room while the door to Cheng Wei\u2019s bedroom was tightly closed.</p><br/><p>In the past, Cheng Wei would excitedly stay in the living room to watch video replays, look through Weibo and play mobile games. Today was the first time he went directly to his bedroom.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian opened the door to the bedroom and saw that Cheng Wei was already sleeping.</p><br/><p>He had his quilt wrapped tightly around him with only his head showing.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled and walked over to sit by the bed. He gently touched Cheng Wei\u2019s head. \u201cAre you pretending? Or are you really uncomfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei moved his head and spoke in a hoarse voice. \u201cLeave me alone, let me sleep for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour voice has become like this. Are you crying?\u201d Tan Shitian smiled and turned over Cheng Wei, only to find that his face was unusually pale and his brow tightly wrinkled. He looked very uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian stretched out a hand and was shocked by the head from the forehead!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are burning up!\u201d Tan Shitian immediately got up to find fever medicine. He poured a cup of warm water and pulled Cheng Wei up against his chest. He fed Cheng Wei the medicine and placed an ice towel on Cheng Wei\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was in a daze and could only feel that someone was taking care of him. The feeling of coldness on his forehead made him feel comfortable and he couldn\u2019t help leaning his head against Cheng Wei\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian\u2019s heart softened and he brought out a clean tower, helping Cheng Wei wipe the sweat off his forehead.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was a player who debuted in the third season but Tan Shitian always felt that he wasn\u2019t grown up or mature.</p><br/><p>Despite being the vice-captain of Time, he didn\u2019t have too much control over the team\u2019s affairs. He still had a child\u2019s heart and didn\u2019t think too much when speaking. Every day, Cheng Wei would happily train and plain. He often had a bright smile on his face and when he became angry, his cheeks bulged out and the speed of his talking increased. Once it was over, he would smile and address Tan Shitian in a familiar manner.</p><br/><p>\u2014He was a very simple person.</p><br/><p>Compared with other vice-captains of the Miracle League, Cheng Wei was simply a small, white rabbit.</p><br/><p>The vice-captain loved to play and the captain had to take on all the responsibilities.</p><br/><p>Due to this, Tan Shitian grew quickly after taking over as captain last season.</p><br/><p>Captain Xu had told him when handing over the captaincy, \u201cXiao Wei debuted earlier than you but he is always heartless and won\u2019t manage the team. Your responsibility will be heavy in the future. If you don\u2019t understand something, talk with your predecessors in the league. You are the youngest captain in the Miracle League. Don\u2019t be arrogant. Keep a modest attitude and you will gain a foothold in the league.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian followed his master\u2019s teachings. Once he was captain, he always smiled and showed an active team atmosphere. He was gentle and cordial, never putting on airs with his teammates. He was also very respectful to the senior players. Regardless of winning or losing the match, his mood was always very calm.</p><br/><p>He was modest and humorous since his debut and his elf archer had a very distinct style. His leadership progressed rapidly and he often wrote fun jokes on Weibo. Tan Shitian, who had the nickname of Storytelling God, quickly won the hearts and minds of the fans of the Time team and was also acknowledged by other captains in the league.</p><br/><p>However, Tan Shitian was very clear that Cheng Wei\u2019s heart didn\u2019t agree.</p><br/><p>Not only did he debuted later than Cheng Wei, his style of leadership was very different compared to Cheng Wei\u2019s idols, Captain Xu and Cat God. It was understandable that Cheng Wei didn\u2019t acknowledge him as captain.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian couldn\u2019t help sighing when he thought of this. \u201cXiao Wei, I know that you don\u2019t agree with me as captain. Compared to Captain Xu and your idol Cat God, I am very poor\u2026 but I have been working hard to raise a good Time team. I\u2019m not a narrow-minded person and I won\u2019t ruin Master\u2019s hard-laid foundation\u2026 trust me, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei couldn\u2019t hear what Tan Shitian was saying due to his fever. His consciousness was blurred but he seemed to capture the key points in Tan Shitian\u2019s words. He couldn\u2019t help crying out, \u201cMaster\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian was startled. He knew that the master Cheng Wei was referring to wasn\u2019t the old captain of Time but the master of his heart, Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei rarely mentioned Cat God but after living in the dorms with him for two years, Tan Shitian gradually found some clues and became aware of the relationship between Cheng Wei and Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian rubbed Cheng Wei\u2019s head and said softly, \u201cCat God is likely to turn to the Dragon Warriors Club. If this is the case, he will certainly have a better development so don\u2019t worry about him.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian picked up the towel that had become hot and went to the bathroom. He washed it with cold water and once again placed it on Cheng Wei\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was cared for very comfortably and finally slept.</p><hr/><br/><p>You can also join my discord channel to chat with fellow readers about the novels;</p><hr/><br/>\n</div>"}

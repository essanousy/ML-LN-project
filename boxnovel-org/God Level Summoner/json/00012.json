The swordsman actively used a group attack to lower the opponents\u2019 blood and cooperate with the elf summoner. Li Cangyu immediately used the thunder spirit\u2019s group attack and the cooperation of the two people led to the elite group of the Wind Colour Guild being defeated in 20 seconds.</p><br/><p>It was hard to fake a master\u2019s subconscious reaction at critical moments. Moreover, Xie Shurong was the fastest swordsman in the domestic Miracle League. Very few people could imitate his \u2018Light and Shadow Rotation\u2019. Even if he hadn\u2019t done his best in the last attack, Li Cangyu immediately recognized him.</p><br/><p>However, Xie Shurong had been away from Miracle for several years. Why was he back this time?</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was very confused and asked in the team channel, \u201cA\u2019shu, I am Old Cat of the FTD team. Do you remember?\u201d (TL: \u2018A\u2019 used to indicate familiarity)</p><br/><p>Blossoming Tree: [\u2026]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan: [Don\u2019t just use ellipsis. Speak up!]</p><br/><p>Blossoming Tree: [\u2026]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan looked at Li Cangyu and said with contempt. \u201cLook at him. You frightened him so much that his IQ fell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu laughed. \u201cHe is probably shocked. Don\u2019t be so hard on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s character had always been gentle and he was very kind to most people. However, Xie Shurong was definitely a special case. Every time Bai Xuan saw his ID, he would be filled with so much anger that his teeth itched and he wanted to beat Xie Shurong up.</p><br/><p>At that time, Xie Shurong took advantage of the agile swordsmanship and skills of the terran swordsman and specialized in killing healers. Every time FTD played against the Flying Feathers team, Xie Shurong would get close to Bai Xuan, constantly interrupting and not letting Bai Xuan use a skill.</p><br/><p>Killed once\u2026 well, it was the right idea to kill the healer in a group battle.</p><br/><p>Killed twice\u2026 he blamed himself for the mistake.</p><br/><p>Killed three times\u2026 Bai Xuan was very depressed.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong chased this small priest and killed him 10 times! Was this killing your father\u2019s enemy?\u201d</p><br/><p>In that game, FTD undoubtedly lost to the Flying Feathers team. After the game, Xie Shurong ran over, stood in front of Bai Xuan with a smile and stretched out his hand. The always good-natured Bai Xuan didn\u2019t shake hands with him, actually picking up his keyboard and turning away.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong made a puzzled expression and Li Cangyu patted his shoulder. \u201cXiao Bai ordinarily doesn\u2019t become angry. The consequences of his anger if very serious. Maybe he will never talk to you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Since then, everyone in the Miracle Professional League knew that Xie Shurong had provoked Vice-Captain Bai, so that the good-natured vice-captain didn\u2019t shake his hand\u2026</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, FTD disbanded not long after that incident and Li Cangyu and Bai Xuan moved to Wulin with their few remaining teammates. Xie Shurong also left the Flying Feathers team for some reason and he was never seen again.</p><br/><p>These old matters were still vivid but time flew quickly. In today\u2019s Miracle League, these stories were just legends.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The three people were somewhat emotional from recalling the past.</p><br/><p>After a long silence, Xie Shurong typed a question: [Cat God, Vice-Captain Bai, why are you in Miracle\u2019s new district? I heard that you went to play Wulin together?]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan replied: [The team\u2019s performance was bad and it disbanded.]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong touched his nose and typed: [Vice-Captain Bai, are you still angry at me for the previous thing?]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan immediately denied it. [No!]</p><br/><p>He denied it so quickly and with an exclamation mark. Wasn\u2019t it obvious that he was angry?</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled helplessly. He only followed his captain\u2019s tactic of \u2018killing the healer and then Cat God\u2019. He managed to kill Bai Xuan 10 times because the members of FTD didn\u2019t protect Bai Xuan at all, always letting Bai Xuan fall under his sword.</p><br/><p>In the field of battle, it wasn\u2019t easy to let the other team\u2019s healer go.</p><br/><p>Perhaps in the eyes of Bai Xuan, he thought that Xie Shurong felt the FTD team was too weak and deliberately bullied them?</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong really didn\u2019t have such thoughts.</p><br/><p>He might\u2019ve been young and frivolous at the time but most players in the league agreed about the standards of Cat God and Vice-Captain Bai. Xie Shurong had been a player who just debuted and couldn\u2019t despise the predecessors who played Miracle for a long time.</p><br/><p>In fact, he felt quite sorry for Cat God and Vice-Captain Bai. He always felt that these two god players were too wasted in the FTD team.</p><br/><p>However, this incident wasn\u2019t easy to explain. Despite so many years passing, it seemed that Bai Xuan was still concerned about the grudges in the game. Xie Shurong skipped this topic and asked, \u201cThe two of you are in the new district. Are you planning to return to the league?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu straightforwardly said, [That is the idea.]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong sent a row of admiring thumbs up. [Great.]</p><br/><p>This was the spirit of perseverance!</p><br/><p>The team had been disbanded two times yet he still had the courage to try again. This was Cat God!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu asked: [What about you? What are you doing in the next district?]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong replied: [I\u2019m just bored and playing casually.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan sent a contemptuous expression. [Bored and playing casually? This excuse would only trick three year old children!!!]</p><br/><p>There were so many exclamation points. It seemed that Vice-Captain Bai was really biased against him.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong tried to imagine the mild-mannered man being angry and found it impossible. He thought that Vice-Captain Bai was just joking with him and replied: [Okay Vice-Captain Bai, don\u2019t be angry. Can I honestly explain?]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled. [Hurry and confess!]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong quickly typed a paragraph to explain. [In fact, after I left the Flying Feathers team, I joined the ICE team in the United States and played there for two and a half years. However, Miracle is launching the World Competition next year and I have a Chinese nationality. It isn\u2019t good to continue staying on this side of the world. I think it is better to return home after my contract expires and see if there are any teams willing to take me on. The national server opened a new district so I was practicing with a side account. I didn\u2019t expect to meet the two of you here.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu immediately captured the key point in his words and asked directly: [When will your contract expire?]</p><br/><p>[The end of this year.]</p><br/><p>[Do you plan to return to the Flying Feathers team?]</p><br/><p>[I won\u2019t return there.] Xie Shurong\u2019s words were very decisive.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help smiling. [Then why don\u2019t you come to our team?]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was surprised. [You are forming a new team?]</p><br/><p>[Yes. At present, I haven\u2019t found all my teammates yet. If you join, I have a bit more confidence about winning the championship.] Li Cangyu said this without changing his expression.</p><br/><p>[\u2026] Xie Shurong was speechless at Cat God\u2019s strong self-confidence. [Cat God, don\u2019t joke around like there. There are so many good first-class teams domestically. Flying Feather, Time, Wind Colour, Ghost Spirits, Pure Cleansing\u2026 do you have the confidence to kill all these strong teams?]</p><br/><p>[I\u2019m not joking.] Li Cangyu said confidently. \u201cThere are many strong domestic teams but they are also people. People have weaknesses and can lose. I don\u2019t think I will be worse than them.\u201d</p><br/><p>[\u2026] Xie Shurong smiled and didn\u2019t take this sentence seriously.</p><br/><p>Self-confidence was a good thing but a confident person wouldn\u2019t necessarily succeed.</p><br/><p>From his point of view, Li Cangyu\u2019s personal ability was indeed first-class. However, Miracle was a team competition. The FTD team had been too weak and helplessly disbanded. It was difficult to imagine that Li Cangyu, the captain of a weak team, could bring a newly formed team to directly win the championship.</p><br/><p>The number of masters in the domestic Miracle League was like clouds. Don\u2019t talk about the super hard to beat Captain Ling Xuefeng of the Wind Colour team. There were the sharp swordsmen of the Flying Feathers team, the assassins of the Ghost Spirits, the kiting ability of the Time team\u2026 the performance of these strong teams were very stable and had their own style of play. It was impossible to beat them all with the same style.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu knew his doubts and spoke bluntly. [I have signed a contract with the Dragon Warriors Club, which will provide me with the best platform. As for teammates, you shouldn\u2019t be able to deny our Vice-Captain Bai\u2019s healing? We also have a talented knight in the front row. If you join, the front row of a terran swordsman and beast paladin will be very stable.]</p><br/><p>[\u2026] Xie Shurong hadn\u2019t expected Cat God to be so serious and stayed silent, carefully reading the words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this team, the front row of defense and the back row of healing is guaranteed. The next step is to look for outputs.] Li Cangyu asked: [My output level, what do you feel about it?]</p><br/><p>[\u2026] Xie Shurong, who was once abused by Cat God by someone in the dueling arena, didn\u2019t know how to answer this question.</p><br/><p>[A\u2019shu, I won\u2019t ask about the reason why you left Flying Feather. But a good horse can\u2019t eat grass. The Flying Feathers team has too many swordsmen, there is no place for you. The other masters in the teams are like clouds and you are from the past. You might not be able to play in the main team so it is better to give yourself a new beginning.] Li Cangyu typed very quickly: [I very much welcome you to join my team. Do you want to think about it?]</p><br/><p>[\u2026] Xie Shurong was stunned silent for a moment. Then he replied: [I\u2019ll think about it and give you an answer.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had been watching Li Cangyu\u2019s explosive speed as he tried to convince Xie Shurong to join the team. Once he finished, he couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you ask me before typing all that? When did I promise to be your vice-captain?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you always been?\u201d Li Cangyu turned back. \u201cI have already decided that you are the vice-captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You really have decided!\u201d Bai Xuan watched him helplessly. After a pause, he asked seriously, \u201cIs it appropriate to bring Xie Shurong in?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it is quite appropriate.\u201d Li Cangyu looked up seriously at Bai Xuan. \u201cYou should know the level of Xie Shurong. Domestically, he is definitely a first-tier player. As one of the famous three swordsmen line in the league, there is no need for me to speak about his personal strength. You should be clear about it after being killed by him so many times. In addition, he had experience with playing against foreign giant clubs. This can also provide me with new ideas in terms of tactics.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw that Bai Xuan still felt complicated and gently patted him on the shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t you dislike him because Xie Shurong used to kill you in the arena? If he really joins our team, you can bully him every day with your identity as the vice-captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bullying him every day?</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help smiling when he thought of this.</p><br/><p>When he thought about how the tree who used to always kill him in the arena would one day fall into his hands, it felt really\u2026 great!</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong suddenly gave a big sneeze from where he was sitting in front of the computer.</p><hr/><br/>\n</div>"}

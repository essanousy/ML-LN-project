Li Cangyu drank a cup of tea and rested for a bit before turning on the computer and opening the game. He just logged into the Love to Eat Braised Fish account when he saw many messages from a private chat window in the lower left corner, all from Luo Xiaoluo.</p><br/><p>[Hello Fish Brother. We would like to invite you and your friends to join the Time Guild!]</p><br/><p>[The strength of our Time Guild in this district is definitely one of the best. You don\u2019t have to be afraid of finding a group for group instances or battlefields. You simply have to chat on our guild channel and finding a team is simple!]</p><br/><p>[After reaching max level, you can directly join our Time Guild\u2019s elite instance group and I guarantee that you will get full equipment in one month!]</p><br/><p>[The president also said that he will get Great God Cheng Wei\u2019s signature. If you join, this signature will be sent to you!]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The calm Cat God saw this and almost spat out a mouthful of tea.</p><br/><p>Actually using Cheng Wei\u2019s signature to hook him into joining the guild, this Time Guild was really using other people\u2019s hard-earned capital to their advantage.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they didn\u2019t know that their God Cheng Wei had always wanted Cat God\u2019s signature.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help smiling when he thought of the young boy who always chased after him for a signature.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei and Xie Shurong were both players who debuted in the third season. Xie Shurong\u2019s style was more aggressive and he had the strong spirit of a swordsman. His style was biased towards violent suppression. Cheng Wei played a white magician. His remote control and movements were very meticulous, making his gameplay smart and flexible.</p><br/><p>After the two people won newcomer awards, Time\u2019s vice-captain retired and Cheng Wei was promoted to the vice-captain position.</p><br/><p>The 16 year old Cheng Wei who just debuted was now almost 19 years old, the peak of an e-sports player\u2019s career. This guy was very lively and cheerful. He looked very cute and was sunny when he laughed. His popularity in the Miracle League was becoming higher and higher, with a large number of loyal fans.</p><br/><p>However, most of the old players in Miracle knew that Cheng Wei was actually a fan of Cat God.</p><br/><p>When playing the game together, Cheng Wei would enthusiastically invite Cat God to eat whenever they met.</p><br/><p>After FTD was disbanded and Li Cangyu led the team to leave, Cheng Wei tried to recruit him only to be rejected. The little guy was still sad for a long time.</p><br/><p>In the past few years, A\u2019Shu had matured a lot and Xiao Cheng also became an adult.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was now 23 years old and in the e-sports circles, this was considered old and he should be thinking about retirement.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t too late to come back now but Li Cangyu was very clear that this was his last chance.</p><br/><p>If he couldn\u2019t get the trophy this time, he would miss out on it for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he must seize this opportunity.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>[Fish Brother is online!] As Li Cangyu was thinking, the private chat window sent another message. It was the guild promoter, Luo Xiaoluo. [Have you considered it? Will you join Time? I\u2019ll send you the signature by express mail!]</p><br/><p>[\u2026] Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help laughing. [You keep Vice-Captain Cheng\u2019s signature. I won\u2019t join the Time Guild.]</p><br/><p>Luo Xiaoluo was shocked. [Aren\u2019t you a fan of Great God Cheng Wei?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [No.]</p><br/><p>Luo Xiaoluo: [\u2026] His face was really beaten!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t want to join the Time Guild but his impression of it was quite good due to Cheng Wei. In addition, the president of Time decisively chose to give up on intercepting the bounty mission. Li Cangyu appreciated this smart approach.</p><br/><p>[Thank your president for the kind invitation. I won\u2019t go to Time and I won\u2019t join other guilds. If I can, I\u2019ll find a place to help later.] Li Cangyu sent this to Luo Xiaoluo. His personality had always been that if they showed him respect, he would naturally respect them back. If they came for death, he could only kill them.</p><br/><p>Luo Xiaoluo sent a screenshot of Love to Eat Braised Fish\u2019s reply to the guild and asked: [President, what should I do?]</p><br/><p>Time Machine considered it before quickly deciding. [Since he doesn\u2019t want to join, we won\u2019t force it. I think this person is ambitious and wants to build his own guild. It is better to be his ally than his enemy. We will continue to wait and see.]</p><br/><p>Luo Xiaoluo was somewhat depressed. [I didn\u2019t expect him to not be a fan of Vice-Captain Cheng.]</p><br/><p>Time Machine laughed. [There are many excellent players in the league. Vice-Captain Cheng\u2019s popularity is very high but he also has a lot of sunspots. This Love to Eat Braised Fish might\u2019ve just heard Vice-Captain Cheng\u2019s name.]</p><br/><p>Luo Xiaoluo sent a row of starry-eyed expressions. [Can I get Vice-Captain Cheng\u2019s signature instead?]</p><br/><p>Time Machine had a headache. [Okay, I will send it to you by express delivery!]</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Not long after, Xie Shurong returned to the club and logged into the game. He sent a message: [Cat God, shall we continue the bounty mission?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [Wait for Xiao Gu to log in and I will introduce you.]</p><br/><p>He just said this when the bottom left corner showed a prompt. [Your friend \u2018As the Name Suggests\u2019 is online.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Gu was forced to sleep at one in the morning by Li Cangyu. He woke up early at 8 o\u2019clock and excitedly turned on his computer. Once he logged into the game, he was shocked! Love to Eat Braised Fish and Love to Eat Twice-cooked Pork were already level 31. He was only level 20 and was 11 levels lower!</p><br/><p>Gu Siming sent a row of tearful expressions. [Captain, you levelled so quickly and didn\u2019t wait for me!]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled, added him to the team and said: [Let me introduce you. This terran swordsman is our new teammate. This is Xiao Gu. He is 17 years old and the main T of our team.]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong typed: [You can call me A\u2019Shu.]</p><br/><p>[Hello A\u2019Shu!] Gu Siming was shocked. [Gaining a new teammate in one night. Captain is really fast!]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong had previously heard from Cat God that there was a very talented paladin in the team but he hadn\u2019t expected it to be a 17 year old boy. He couldn\u2019t help wondering, could this 17 year old boy be reliable?</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan seemed to guess his doubts and took the initiative to send him a private message. [Xiao Gu is the most talented newcomer in the Dragon Warriors training camp. He hasn\u2019t played the game for long and is still tender, but he has great potential. He is also smart. If we train him well, he can definitely become a strong teammate.]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong dispelled the doubts in his heart. When he and Cheng Wei had won the rookie awards, he had just turned 18 and Cheng Wei was only 16 years old. Using age to judge a player wasn\u2019t reliable. Xiao Gu was 17 years old this year and would be 18 when the next season started. In fact, this wasn\u2019t too young. There were many outstanding young competitors in the league.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong thought up to here and replied to Bai Xuan. [Thank you for your explanation. I understand now.]</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan: [You\u2019re welcome. It is what I should do.]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong couldn\u2019t help smiling. No wonder why people used to say that Vice-Captain Bai was gentle and careful. This man really was very considerate. He knew that Xie Shurong would be questioning Xiao Gu\u2019s ability and explained it clearly so that the teammates could get along.</p><br/><p>While explaining to Xie Shurong, Bai Xuan also sent a message to Gu Siming. [A\u2019Shu is a master. I will slowly tell you his specific history after entering the team. First try and see if you can keep up with his rhythm.]</p><br/><p>A master swordsman? Where did he come from?</p><br/><p>Gu Siming endured his strong curiosity and replied: [I know!]</p><br/><p>[Come, let\u2019s do the bounty mission together.] Li Cangyu typed on the team channel before pulling his teammates into the voice room.</p><br/><p>Gu Siming put on his headset and said, \u201cCaptain, I am only level 20. Will it be a hindrance if I do the bounty mission with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, we will cover you. Raise your level first.\u201d Li Cangyu explained. \u201cIf you keep doing bounty missions, you should be able to reach level 27 by 12 o\u2019clock. Once we go to sleep, you should go and level by yourself. You should be level 35 when we see each other tomorrow and we will go to an instance together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to gain 15 levels in one day?\u201d Gu Siming asked while feeling great pressure.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is to test you.\u201d Li Cangyu replied.</p><br/><p>Gu Siming immediately nodded. \u201cCaptain, I understand! I will complete the test!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming lit up after being praised by Cat God.</p><br/><p>The four people teamed up at the bounty mission release point and once again received an escort NPC bounty mission.</p><br/><p>In the case where no one intercepted it, the bounty mission was much smoother than playing an instance boss. By 8:30 in the evening, Li Cangyu had risen to level 32 and Xiao Gu also rose to level 22.</p><br/><p>Everyone chatted while doing the mission and they didn\u2019t feel bored.</p><br/><p>After receiving another bounty mission, Bai Xuan asked, \u201cIs there still no one interfering in this round?\u201d</p><br/><p>He just finished speaking when a row of IDs suddenly appeared not far away. They were waiting there so it was clearly not a good thing.</p><br/><p>Incredibly, it was the elite team led by President Popular Land Under Heaven of the Wind Colour Guild!</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong was shocked. \u201cThey already lost two groups and they still want to send another? This is really high perseverance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cI guess that they have found a helper.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The guild office of the Wind Colour team.</p><br/><p>A cold-looking, handsome young man sat in front of the computer, his slender fingers quickly tapping the mouse to replay the video.</p><br/><p>After watching the video, the teenager frowned slightly and said, \u201cThe first person point of view that you recorded isn\u2019t very clear. What happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The president, Popular Land Under Heaven scratched his head with embarrassment. \u201cThis is what happened. Last night, we led a team to intercept the bounty mission. We met a three member team and were killed by them. A\u2019Zhou recorded it and wanted to ask God Qin Mo to look at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo looked back with surprise. \u201cYou mean six people were killed by three people? The team was wiped out?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Popular Land Under Heaven wiped his sweat. \u201cThe team was wiped out twice\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cThe team was destroyed twice?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Everyone present made an awkward expression.</p><br/><p>To be honest, the news that the elite six member team of Time Colour had been wiped out twice had already spread through the new district so they didn\u2019t know what to do. They came to find Qin Mo because he was the youngest player on the team and they were the most familiar with him out of the players on the professional league side.</p><br/><p>As for Captain Ling\u2026</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t dare to disturb him at all! It would be complete humiliation!</p><br/><p>Qin Mo frowned. \u201cIt is best not to let Master know about this. It is too disgraceful for Wind Colour.\u201d</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven immediately agreed. \u201cYes yes, we will do our best to hide it from Captain Ling.\u201d</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t imagine what the consequences would be if Captain Ling found out\u2026</p><br/><p>Qin Mo said, \u201cGive me the account of a blood kin summoner. I will go to see who they are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Vice President Same Boat Under Wind and Rain immediately handed over his computer.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Inside the game, Li Cangyu saw that the six people opposite were motionless and typed in the area channel: [President, are you coming for the bounty mission again?]</p><br/><p>Popular Land Under Heaven looked at Qin Mo with embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was very decisive. He didn\u2019t say anything and directly pressed the PK button.</p><br/><p>[Player Same Boat Under Wind and Rain, blood kin race, summoner class, level 32, is requesting to learn from you.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu agreed.</p><br/><p>The opposite blood kin summoner started with calling a blood spider to quickly and accurately bit Li Cangyu!</p><br/><p>Once Xie Shurong saw this situation, he immediately said on the voice channel, \u201cIt is Qin Mo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was surprised and asked, \u201cThe genius boy of the Wind Colour team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xie Shurong said, \u201cI have seen many Wind Colour games. It is his habit to start with a blood-sucking spider. It is like Cat God said. Since the Wind Colour Guild dared come to us again, they must\u2019ve found a helper. The person controlling the blood kin summoner on the other side of the computer must be Qin Mo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu listened to the two people on the voice chat and couldn\u2019t help wondering, \u201cWho is Qin Mo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming actively started to explain. \u201cCaptain, Qin Mo is one year younger than me! He is a rookie who just debuted this year in the Wind Colour team. He plays a blood kin summoner and is Captain Ling Xuefeng\u2019s only apprentice! He is also known as Wind Colour\u2019s little prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was silent for a moment. \u201cSince he is Ling Xuefeng\u2019s apprentice, he is also counted as my apprentice. There is no need to take care of this child and I\u2019ll teach him a good lesson.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming lit a row of candles for Qin Mo.</p><hr/><hr/><br/>\n</div>"}

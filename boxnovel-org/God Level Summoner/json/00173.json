Before the Canglan team returned to the league, the Terminator team was ranked at the bottom with Cheetah right above them. Cheetah ranked second last in the sixth season\u2019s regular season.</p><br/><p>This team\u2019s style was very clear. It mainly relied on the hunters\u2019 traps for output.</p><br/><p>Cheetah\u2019s captain, Jiang Xu was a player who debuted in the second season with Su Guangmo and Yu Pingsheng. However, Jiang Xu was low-ley in the league compared to the highly popular Su Guangmo. He was known as the best hunter but he didn\u2019t have many fans.</p><br/><p>The operation of a hunter in Miracle was extremely complicated. The number of people playing a hunter in the players base wasn\u2019t big and Jiang Xu wasn\u2019t handsome compared to the other captain. His face naturally couldn\u2019t capture beauty fans.</p><br/><p>Of course, Jiang Xu had his own means if he could lead the Cheetah team for so many years in the Miracle League. A;though the Cheetah team\u2019s tactic was the \u2018trap flow\u2019 style, many strong teams had been beaten by it, especially in the regular season. The giant teams of Flying Feathers, Time and Wind Colour had all lost to Cheetah before. Jiang Xu\u2019s use of maps to set up tactics couldn\u2019t be underestimated.</p><br/><p>Last season, an old player of Cheetah retired and Jiang Xu discovered the talented newcomer Chen Anran. This newcomer\u2019s debut was different from Cheng Wei and Qin Mo. He was as low-key as his captain and no one noticed him until the end of the season where the judges discovered that this 16 year old was particularly stable.</p><br/><p>The Most Promising Rookie Award went to Chen Anran, leaving many viewers confused. However, most of the league\u2019s captains recognized Xiao Chen\u2019s level.</p><br/><p>This included Li Cangyu. He watched the videos of Cheetah\u2019s games and noticed that Chen Anran, a player with almost no sense of existence, was the Cheetah team\u2019s most powerful weapon.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>For the preparations this week, Li Cangyu specifically arranged for Zhuo Hang to watch the videos of the Cheetah team and to ask if he didn\u2019t understand anything.</p><br/><p>Watching videos over and over was more boring than daily training. Li Cangyu originally thought that Zhuo Hang wouldn\u2019t be eager to do this due to his pride and narcissism. Surprisingly, Zhuo Hang was very serious. He didn\u2019t show any impatience despite watching the same video ten times in a row.</p><br/><p>On a closer look, it was discovered that Li Xiaojiang was sitting next to him.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had confirmed in advance that Li Xiaojiang wouldn\u2019t be playing in the match against Cheetah. His black magician had no advantage over the hunters who could quickly set traps. He had Li Xiaojiang train by himself for a few days which would allow him to digest what he learnt.</p><br/><p>There was no need to play on the weekend. Other players might used this time to rest but Li Xiaojiang had always been the most serious person. He might not have to play in the next match but he wasn\u2019t idle. He sat seriously and watched the videos together with Zhuo Hang.</p><br/><p>The two little guys had been working together for a long time and their relationship had improved greatly. Even if Zhuo Hang might not be happy in his heart about Cat God\u2019s arrangement, Li Xiaojiang was watching the videos so seriously that Zhuo Hang didn\u2019t dare express it.</p><br/><p>He watched it many times and made a discovery. He looked back at Li Cangyu and said, \u201cCaptain, this Chen Anran plays a terran hunter. It is reasonable to say that his movement speed shouldn\u2019t be faster than an elf hunter. However, I found that when he is setting traps, he is actually faster than his captain Jiang Xu and he is a lot faster than me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing able to find it means that you are looking carefully.\u201d Li Cangyu patted him on the shoulder. \u201cYou should figure out the reason yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay!\u201d Zhuo Hang scratched his head and thought carefully. Then Li Xiaojiang suddenly whispered, \u201cIs it because of his hand, hand, hand speed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang\u2019s eyes brightened and he immediately pulled up the game\u2019s statistics panel. Sure enough, Chen Anran\u2019s hand speed actually exceeded 500. This was almost comparable to the great gods with the best hand speed in the league!</p><br/><p>The fastest players in the Miracle League were undoubtedly Ling Xuefeng and Li Cangyu. Their peak outbreak could reach a hand speed of more than 550. Other big captains like Tan Shitian, Su Guangmo and Lou Wushuang could reach a speed of almost 500. Chen Anran\u2019s hand speed could reach the level of these great gods. It was no wonder why he won the Most Promising Rookie Award last season.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cThis is why he plays a terran hunter. His hand speed is fast enough and he doesn\u2019t need the agility advantage of an elf. A terran hunter might lack speed but he can make up for it with his hand speed. A terran hunter has higher survivability so his hunter is a fast, defensive and highly flexible output.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang seriously asked, \u201cB-But don\u2019t skills have cooldowns? How can he become faster by relying on his hand speed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang listened to his stuttered question and couldn\u2019t help smiling. He explained, \u201cHunters have a difficult method of play called trap cooling. It means that a trap placed by a hunter can reduce the cooldown time of a trap and enhance the damage as long as it successfully captures the prey. In other words, if a hunter\u2019s operation is accurate enough and the traps always capture the prey then in theory, the trap skills can be continuously released without a cooldown.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d Li Xiaojiang nodded as he realized. He was silent for a moment before saying doubtfully, \u201cIsn\u2019t, isn\u2019t this just a theory? It should be difficult to actually achieve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Zhuo Hang patiently replied, \u201cAt present, the world\u2019s strongest hunter can achieve the seamless connection of common trap skills at key moments. My, cough, my accuracy isn\u2019t high enough. At this point, Chen Anran is much more powerful than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han heard the conversation between them and couldn\u2019t help interrupting, \u201cAre you actually admitting someone is better than you? This is rare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Youngster, do you have to be so honest? I know it in my heart. Do you need to say it?\u2019</p><br/><p>Xiao Han\u2019s words made Zhuo Hang cough with embarrassment a few times. Li Xiaojiang saw this and couldn\u2019t help smiling. Xiao Han\u2019s words were true. Zhuo Hang always said things like, \u2018I am handsome\u2019, \u2018I am very good\u2019 and \u2018watch my powerful performance.\u2019 This was the first time he said that someone was better than him.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang saw Li Xiaojiang smiling and his ears turned red. He glanced at Xiao Han and cried out, \u201cGo practice and stop fooling around!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han made an innocent expression. \u201cI am listening to you speak about the hunter\u2019s trap cooling. Your words are very reasonable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s fingers were quickly tapping the keyboard but his ears weren\u2019t idle. He heard the words of the teenagers in his ears.</p><br/><p>He ignored Xiao Han\u2019s blunt words and was very happy that Zhuo Hang could find Chen Anran\u2019s advantages and admit his own shortcomings.</p><br/><p>It seemed that Zhuo Hang\u2019s mentality had changed after working with the sluggish Li Xiaojiang for a long time.</p><br/><p>Compared to the initial Zhuo Hang who was proud and looked down on this teammates, this Zhuo Hang was willing to discuss issues and share his experiences with his teammates. It was definitely a great improvement.</p><br/><p>The child was proud due to being spoiled but he wasn\u2019t blind to the facts. He only spoke narcissistic words but his heart was calm. The best thing in a match was to recognize the gap between yourself and your opponent. It was only by understanding the opponent\u2019s strength and your weaknesses that it would be possible to find a way to win.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw that Zhuo Hang was still watching the video and walked behind him. \u201cIf you play with Chen Anran alone, what do you think is the most important thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang seriously thought about it and replied, \u201cBreaking his rhythm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a good understanding.\u201d Li Cangyu smiled and confirmed his answer. Then he said, \u201cHow do you interrupt your opponent\u2019s fast pace? Come to the arena and fight me. I will personally teach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang excitedly jumped out of his seat. This was the first time that Cat God would be personally guiding him!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu took Zhuo Hang to a corner of the training room and found two free computers. They sat down, opened a side account and created a locked room in human-machine training mode.</p><br/><p>Xiao Han, Gu Siming and the others had their own training tasks. They were curious but didn\u2019t dare run around. Li Xiaojiang looked over with a curious expression and Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cXiaojiang, come here and watch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiaojiang was happy and immediately pulled a chair to sit behind Zhuo Hang.</p><br/><p>The Miracle human-machine training mode could be set by him. Li Cangyu chose a forest map filled with mobs and also opened a hunter account. It was the first time Zhuo Hang had seen Cat God playing a hunter.</p><br/><p>He thought that Li Cangyu was a master of summoning. Now he was playing a hunter and Zhuo Hang should be able to cope. It turned out that Cat God might not be a professional hunter but he could rely on his hand speed to give the enemy great trouble!</p><br/><p>Trap cooling\u2026 this style of play was used by Li Cangyu. Zhuo Hang could only feel dazzled as colourful and beautiful light effects flashed without interruption. The hunter\u2019s traps were placed one by one and the mobs on the ground fell one by one. Cat God wasn\u2019t playing a hunter, he was simply a bulldozer!</p><br/><p>In less than a minute, the nearby mobs were wiped out by Cat God. Li Xiaojiang looked at the captain with adoration and Zhuo Hang was gobsmacked.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw the teenager\u2019s surprised face and patted him on the head. He asked, \u201cDo you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang smiled with embarrassment. \u201c\u2026No, it\u2019s too fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu explained, \u201cIt will be like this against Chen Anran. You will find that his speed isn\u2019t slower than me. He is a full-time hunter and is definitely better at the hunter\u2019s skills. The Cheetah team is strong in team battles because Chen Anran and Jiang Xu will rely on trap cooling to reduce the cooldown and clean up the mobs on the map as quickly as possible. This might not seem terrible but once it accumulates, their economic benefits will become the highest in the game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang suddenly realized. \u201cI understand. He relies on this quick killing method to gain a higher economy and take the advantage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cYes, if you want to confront him then you must find a way to interrupt his rhythm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang carefully pondered on it. He seemed to understand and seriously gripped his mouse. \u201cTry again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu pressed start and the two people entered the dense mob forest map to practice releasing traps.</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang was extremely serious and had a high understanding. It only took him a bit of time to know what to do, making a hint a appreciation form in Li Cangyu\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Perhaps Zhuo Hang wasn\u2019t as impetuous as he was in the beginning due to the subtle influence of Li Xiaojiang. Now he could calm down and practice this boring and monotonous operation. He had no complaints despite the hours of continuous practice. Li Cangyu\u2019s decision to let him partner with Li Xiaojiang was really correct. The people with opposite personalities had a positive influence on each other. This was a good thing as they could progress together.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Since he had made up his mind, he was going to take the initiative because he really didn\u2019t want to give Ling Xuefeng to anyone else.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was his. Others might want to hug or kiss him but they couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>If Ling Xuefeng was a woman, he would\u2019ve confessed a long time ago. However, the other person was a man\u2026 a man who was serious and indifferent. A hasty confession wasn\u2019t too good.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wanted to visit Ling Xuefeng\u2019s house as a friend. In addition to wanting to know more about Ling Xuefeng, he wanted to see what Ling Xuefeng\u2019s parents were like. Could they accept it if their son was with a man?</p><br/><p>Before their relationship began, he wanted to lay the foundations first. Then he wouldn\u2019t be disturbed by the elders in the future.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu sat on the sofa and thought about it. Meanwhile, Ling Xuefeng quickly prepared the food and set the table. He looked into the living room and stated, \u201cCome and eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smelt fish and immediately rushed over. He picked up his chopsticks and quickly tasted a mouthful, praising, \u201cIt is so delicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked at this greedy appearance and couldn\u2019t help smiling slightly, his eyes full of affection.</p><br/><p>It was just that Li Cangyu\u2019s head was buried in eating the fish and didn\u2019t see it.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Once the two of them had eaten, Ling Xuefeng went to the kitchen to wash the dishes while Li Cangyu borrowed his shower.</p><br/><p>The shampoo and shower gel were those used by Ling Xuefeng. Li Cangyu hadn\u2019t come here with shower gel, forcing him to borrow Ling Xuefeng\u2019s.</p><br/><p>After the shower, he found that his body had a faint mint scent. It was the exact same scent as Ling Xuefeng\u2019s body. LI Cangyu was very satisfied with this and the feeling made him excited.</p><br/><p>He went out in his pyjamas and found that Ling Xuefeng had finished the washing and was watching TV in the living room. Li Cangyu went up to him and sat down, discovering that a basketball game was being broadcasted on TV. It was a big NBA matchup.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu himself played basketball and watched the games when he was free. There were many stars on the screen that he knew and he found that Ling Xuefeng was watching the screen seriously. Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cThe number 8 is very handsome. His shooting rate is high.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng echoed him, \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu suddenly asked, \u201cDo you think I am handsome when playing basketball?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked over at Li Cangyu and found that the other person was quite serious when asking this question. Ling Xuefeng endured the impulse to directly pounce on him and pretended to be calm. \u201cYou are very handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was ecstatic in his heart and there was a bright smile on his face. Being praised by the person he liked really made his mood fly up. The feeling of being appreciated was indescribably good.</p><br/><p>The thing that Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t tell Li Cangyu was that he actually started to pay attention to basketball because of Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>A few years ago, after a pre-match meeting of the Miracle Professional League, Li Cangyu was bored and went to the open air court behind the hotel with Su Guangmo. It was the first time that Ling Xuefeng had seen him playing on the court. The fast-running teenager with a bright smile in the sunlight, his strong figure when jumping and shooting was a visual shock inscribed in Ling Xuefeng\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>It was also that day that Ling Xuefeng discovered Li Cangyu\u2019s favourite outdoor sport was basketball. He had a favourite team and often took time to watch the games.</p><br/><p>The sport that his beloved person liked, he needed to know more so that they had a common language in the future.</p><br/><p>With that in mind, Ling Xuefeng started to pay attention to NBA games.</p><br/><p>Over the years, he gradually fell in love with this intense sport because\u2026 it reminded him of the beautiful teenager in his memory who dribbled the basketball with a smile. This scene was as pure and beautiful as a watercolor.</p><br/><p>Today was the first time that the two people sat together to watch the game. LI Cangyu commented while Ling Xuefeng echoed a few words. It was simple communication but Li Cangyu felt particularly comfortable. Ling Xuefeng really understood him. They even had similar hobbies!</p><br/><p>He never thought that these so-called \u2018similar hobbies\u2019 was actually because a person had been silently waiting.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>By the time the game finished, it was almost time for bed. Ling Xuefeng had bought a two-bedroom apartment in Shanghai, turning it into one bedroom and one study. There was no bed in the study but the sofa in the living room was enough to fit an adult male.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng originally wanted to give Li Cangyu the bed and sleep on the sofa. Then Li Cangyu offered, \u201cYour bed is big enough. If you don\u2019t mind, we can sleep together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This person was really unstoppable when he took the initiative.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw the pure gaze and smiled. \u201cFine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men brushed their teeth and entered Ling Xuefeng\u2019s bedroom to sleep.</p><br/><p>The size of this bed was really big. Li Cangyu had slept here last time and he remembered that the bed was soft and comfortable. He slept particularly well.</p><br/><p>Only, this time it was impossible for him to sleep.</p><br/><p>The person he liked was lying next to him, how could he sleep?</p><br/><p>He lay in bed with Ling Xuefeng and the two people had the same shower gel scent, like it was wrapped around their bodies. Li Cangyu felt his heart going \u2018thump, thump\u2019 like a runaway drumbeat. He desperately breathed to restrain himself from the urge to turn around and hold Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Compared to Li Cangyu\u2019s taut body, Ling Xuefeng was calmly lying down next to him.</p><br/><p>The man\u2019s expression was calm, his eyes were closed and it didn\u2019t take long for him to breathe evenly. He seemed to be sleeping very well?</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu heard the uniform breathing sound beside his ears and couldn\u2019t help whispering, \u201cXuefeng, are you asleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no answer.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu boldly turned around.</p><br/><p>This was the first time he could observe Ling Xuefeng so closely. The tall nose was really carved by the creator. The eyebrows were slightly raised, revealing a hint of indifference. With the eyes closed, the side of his face appeared a bit gentle. His lips were the best. The shape was beautiful and people couldn\u2019t help wanting to kiss them.</p><br/><p>This appearance was worthy of being the top three in the Miracle League.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were no fixed standards for netizens in the Miracle League. Everyone had their own preferences. Su Guangmo\u2019s heartiness and Tan Shitian\u2019s warmth made them a lot of fans. Therefore, no player dared say they were the first.</p><br/><p>But in Li Cangyu\u2019s heart, Ling Xuefeng\u2019s was the handsomest man in the league! Su Guangmo and Tan Shitian were on the sidelines. How could they be more handsome than his Xuefeng?</p><br/><p>He was so good-looking that the way he fell asleep was nothing short of a crime\u2026</p><br/><p>Maybe it was in the eyes of the beholder but why didn\u2019t Li Cangyu realize he was so handsome before?</p><br/><p>Li Closed thought for a while and saw that the other person\u2019s eyes were still closed. He finally raised his courage and gently touched this good-looking nose. Then his fingertips touched the lips.</p><br/><p>His fingers poked the lips. The soft lips were a contrast to the indifferent appearance.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s heart suddenly beat fiercely and breathing was a bit difficult. His mind was blank as Li Cangyu moved like a ghost, slowly approaching and then\u2026 gently planting a kiss on Ling Xuefeng\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Once his spirit came back, Li Cangyu realized what he had done and immediately moved back.</p><br/><p>\u2026Had his brain short-circuited?</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t even sure of Ling Xuefeng\u2019s sexuality yet he stole a kiss. This was simply immoral behavior!</p><br/><p>It was too much, the sin was unforgivable!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was yelling at himself in his heart but the warm touch on his lips made his mood particularly pleasant.</p><br/><p>It was his first kiss. What about Ling Xuefeng? In any case, it was better than he imagined.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that Li Cangyu was so afraid to wake Ling Xuefeng up that he could only kiss the lips gently.</p><br/><p>He was worried that there wouldn\u2019t be a good end. Li Cangyu immediately turned around and wrapped the quilt around himself to sleep. Still, the kiss left an endless aftertaste in his heart.</p><br/><p>He was completely unaware that the Ling Xuefeng behind him suddenly opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>The always cold and tough man\u2019s eyes were full of turmoil. Complex colours filled his eyes before he finally gave a gentle smile.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu woke up the next morning and found that the bed beside him was empty. He guessed that Ling Xuefeng was making breakfast and didn\u2019t care about him. Li Cangyu first went to the bathroom to wash his face and brush his teeth. Then he headed to the dining room.</p><br/><p>The prepared breakfast was already on the table.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw Li Cangyu coming over and asked, \u201cDid you wake up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu looked into this deep eyes and then his eyes moved to Ling Xuefeng\u2019s lips. He remembered his daring kiss last night and couldn\u2019t help blushing.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat something first. We will head to my parent\u2019s house in the afternoon.\u201d Ling Xuefeng sat down opposite him and handed hot milk to Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>The two of them ate breakfast and Li Cangyu suggested, \u201cWe are free in the morning. Let\u2019s go visit the mall so I can buy Auntie and Uncle a small gift.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng said, \u201cThere is no need to be polite. My parents aren\u2019t lacking anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu protested. \u201cHow can I do that? It is the first time visiting your home. I can\u2019t come empty-handed!\u201d</p><br/><p>He insisted on buying gifts. The helpless Ling Xuefeng had to take him to a nearby shopping mall.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu opened the buying mode of a local tyrant and bought a super expensive massage foot bath for Ling Xuefeng\u2019s father and a valuable jewelry for his mother\u2026</p><br/><p>Such valuable gifts, who would believe the person was an ordinary friend?</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng followed to help him carry things. Once he saw Li Cangyu buying presents for his parents, his eyes filled with tenderness.</p><br/><p>After last night where \u2018Li Cangyu stole a kiss\u2019, Ling Xuefeng was able to be sure that this person had made up his mind. That\u2019s why Li Cangyu cared for him and took the initiative to come over to hug, sleep and gain his parent\u2019s approval.</p><br/><p>Cat God was really enthusiastic, just like the straightforward youth from his memories.</p><br/><p>The two people hadn\u2019t officially entered a relationship but Ling Xuefeng knew how happy it was to have his beloved finally like him back! At this warm time, he wanted to turn one second into ten seconds to slowly relish it.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu bought two more bottles of red wine and was satisfied. He looked at the big bag of gifts Ling Xuefeng was holding and asked worriedly, \u201cWhat if Uncle and Auntie don\u2019t like what I bought?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. They are already very happy that you are coming home with me for the new year.\u201d</p><br/><p>This morning, Ling Xuefeng had sent a text message to his mother: [This year, I will bring back an important person for the new year.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s mother was ecstatic and immediately went to buy a lot of food.</p><br/><p>Thus, Li Cangyu arrived at dinner time carrying a large pile of gifts and was unexpectedly warmly welcomed by Ling Xuefeng\u2019s mother.</p><br/><p>The well-maintained woman had a gentle and generous temperament. Her face was full of laughter as she said, \u201cYou must be Xiao Li. Xuefeng often mentioned you. Come in, come in and sit. This young man, you are really tall and handsome! I made a table of delicious dishes. There is the braised fish that you love to eat. Come and eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Auntie, wasn\u2019t this wrong? You are too\u2026 too enthusiastic!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The six members of the losing Frost Team prepared three signatures each as gifts for random audience members and the officials also prepared many souvenirs for those in front of the TV who guessed right.</p><br/><p>The fans supporting the Fire Team saw this scene and couldn\u2019t help feeling envious. [Limited edition signatures! I knew I should\u2019ve prayed for the Fire Team to lose!] [I am a Captain Su fan and I want the Fire Team to lose!] [I\u2019m a fan of Daddy Bai! I want his signature. Asking the Fire Team to lose!]</p><br/><p>A scene where the fans demanded their favourite players lose could only be seen at the Carnival.</p><br/><p>After the event, the 12 contestants were sent back to their hotel in a car. The league arranged a dinner for them in advance. Cheng Wei actively sat next to Li Cangyu while Tan Shitian came over and sat next to Cheng Wei.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei felt a bit awkward. He tried his best to kill Tan Shitian in the game today and the result was that Tan Shitian spared him in the punishment stage. He felt a bit sorry towards Captain Tan\u2026 However, Cheng Wei wasn\u2019t a person who easily bowed his head and admitted his mistake, especially in front of Tan Shitian.</p><br/><p>Originally, he debuted a year earlier than Tan Shitian and was considered Tan Shitian\u2019s senior. The result was that he was worse than Tan Shitian. If he admitted his mistake then he would have no dignity as a senior!</p><br/><p>He was thinking this when a chicken leg was placed in his bowl. He looked up to see Tan Shitian\u2019s smiling eyes. \u201cI\u2019ll give this to you so eat it quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei wasn\u2019t very comfortable. He ate the chicken leg while muttering, \u201cOh, thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next to them, Ling Xuefeng naturally helped Li Cangyu grab fish while Su Guangmo took care of Yu Pingsheng. Lou Wushuang\u2019s gaze swept over this scene and then he looked at his stupid brother who was taking care of himself and hit him on the thigh.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui was hit and looked up innocently at him. \u201cBrother, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang touched his glasses and demanded coldly, \u201cGive me a piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui scratched his head and placed a piece of lean pork ribs into his brother\u2019s bowl. Lou Wushuang was satisfied as he coldly ate the ribs.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan and Yan Ruiwen were chatting together. Both of them were vice-captains and there were many common topics. In these types of occasions, Liu Xiang didn\u2019t speak a lot and she just quietly ate. Chu Yan was bored and joined Yan Ruiwen and Bai Xuan\u2019s conversation.</p><br/><p>The group of people finished dinner and went back to the room to rest. Cheng Wei followed behind Li Cangyu and refused to leave when he arrived at Li Cangyu\u2019s door. Li Cangyu smiled and looked at him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei hesitated for a moment before suddenly exclaiming, \u201cCat God, I will sleep with you tonight!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two men walking in the back looked a bit strange when they heard this. Cheng Wei had a simple expression on his face as he hugged Li Cangyu\u2019s arm. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you for a long time and I want to chat with you. Can I change rooms with Vice-Captain Bai?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan helplessly looked at Li Cangyu and didn\u2019t saw anything. Tan Shitian came over to help. \u201cThese rooms are arranged by the league and can\u2019t be changed. If you want to change it then talk to the chairman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was startled and asked, \u201cIs this true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian seriously replied, \u201cOf course, the league has records of the check-in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was successfully deceived and scratched his head. \u201cOh, then I will talk to Cat God for a bit and go to sleep at 11 o\u2019clock.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had a strange sense of dependence on Li Cangyu. It was probably because he joined the league when he was really young. He left his hometown and came to the strange Beijing alone. During that critical period, Li Cangyu pointed out the most suitable road for him and he won the newcomer award in one swoop\u2026</p><br/><p>Cat God was always on Cheng Wei\u2019s mind so every time he saw Cat God, he wanted to be close to the other person. Now that he made this request, he felt some apprehension. He was afraid that Cat God would dislike it.</p><br/><p>This really was like a small fan facing an idol!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu softened when he saw Cheng Wei\u2019s eyes and he couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cThen come in and chat for a bit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei made a happy sound and followed Li Cangyu into the room. The result made him depressed because Ling Xuefeng and Tan Shitian also entered!</p><br/><p>He wanted to say a few words to Cat God. Why were these two big lightbulbs following?</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was very depressed and didn\u2019t say much as he followed behind Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan considerately brewed a pot of tea for everyone. They sat down on the sofa and Ling Xuefeng said, \u201cIf there isn\u2019t something unexpected tomorrow then it should be a team battle event. After the event, everyone will go back to their teams.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu laughed. \u201cThe next round is Wind Colour\u2019s away game against Canglan. You have to be prepared when leading the team to Changsha. I will give you a surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng asked, \u201cIs the surprise winning against me 3:0?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu cried out, \u201cYou guessed it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng casually said, \u201cDon\u2019t be too proud. Maybe Wind Colour will win 3:0.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng and Li Cangyu were chatting and Cheng Wei couldn\u2019t insert any words.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian said gracefully, \u201cThe two-day Carnival is just a domestic activity. The second World Carnival in October this year is the highlight. Last year, our 3v3 teams won the championship and third place. Perhaps this year we can win the championship and second place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu told him, \u201cNot necessarily. I heard gossip that the World League will change the rules of the 3v3 project. It is likely that each country can only send one 3v3 team, so as to not have powerful countries send two teams like last year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei finally found an opportunity to interject. \u201cIf you play 3v3, Cat God and Captain Ling can team up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at him. \u201cI might not be selected.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei exclaimed, \u201cIt will definitely be fine. I will help you gain votes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and patted his head. Cheng Wei was pure in nature. During this domestic Carnival, he publicly helped Li Cangyu gain votes on Weibo. He seemed to have forgotten that the World Carnival had a limited number of players. If he helped others then he might not be able to enter.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian looked at his warm scene and couldn\u2019t help feeling envious. If Cheng Wei\u2019s heart towards him could be half as good as it was towards Cat God, he would be fine\u2026</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>That night, Cheng Wei stayed in Li Cangyu\u2019s room until 11 o\u2019clock. Once he returned to his room, he immediately rushed into the bathroom. It seemed he was too embarrassed to face Tan Shitian.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian didn\u2019t care and entered the bathroom once Cheng Wei finished washing up.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei lay in bed and listened to the sound of water in the bathroom. He closed his eyes, wanting to sleep but he couldn\u2019t. His mind repeatedly replayed the image of Tan Shitian bending over in front of him as his fingers slipped gently through Tan Shitian\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian came out after his shower and Cheng Wei secretly opened his eyes to have a look, only to meet Tan Shitian\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The person who was discovered peeking turned red and quickly covered himself with a quilt, pretending to sleep. Tan Shitian came over and sat by his bed. \u201cAre you hiding? Are you afraid to see me? Didn\u2019t you say that you were going to abuse me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian forcibly opened the quiet and his heart trembled when he saw the red Cheng Wei.</p><br/><p>This person had no idea how tempting he was.</p><br/><p>The red face, the clear black eyes and the gently bitten lips made Tan Shitian want to directly pounce and kiss him breathless!</p><br/><p>Moreover, today Cheng Wei joined hands with Cat God to kill him. Tan Shitian didn\u2019t say anything but he was actually a bit jealous. Cat God\u2019s weight in Cheng Wei\u2019s mind was much higher than Tan Shitian. This feeling was really uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>The simple eyes made Tan Shitian suppress his heart. He gently touched Cheng Wei\u2019s head and said, \u201cDo you know why I particularly like to touch your hair?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei wondered, \u201cBecause I am easier to bully?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian laughed. \u201cStupid, others put their heads in front of me and I don\u2019t want to touch them. I want to touch your head because I think you are really cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s eyes widened angrily. \u201cDon\u2019t use the word cute to describe a man!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled and leaned so that his lips were against Cheng Wei\u2019s ears. He spoke in a low voice, \u201cAre you a man? You are considered a small boy at most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s face flushed. \u201cI am 19 years old, I\u2019m almost 20!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYet you aren\u2019t mature in some respects.\u201d Tan Shitian smiled. \u201cYou haven\u2019t held a girl\u2019s hand and don\u2019t you still have your first kiss?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei became more and more angry. \u201cSo what? This shows that I am a very serious person! I don\u2019t mess around with people! My first kiss is to be left to my future wife!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian saw his desperate appearance and liked it even more. He couldn\u2019t help leaning closer. \u201cYou want to kiss your wife but do you know how to kiss someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was stunned. \u201cNo, just\u2026 mouth to mouth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian was about to laugh to death. He suppressed it and whispered, \u201cIt naturally isn\u2019t that simple. You don\u2019t even know this. You will be hated by your wife in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei shouted angrily, \u201cShut up! I don\u2019t want to discuss this topic with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>He covered himself with the quilt to sleep. As a result, Tan Shitian once again opened the quilt and asked, \u201cDo you want me to teach you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s eyes widened with surprise. \u201cAre you stupid?! You will still teach this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian thought, \u2018Aren\u2019t you the stupid one? Since joining the Time Team at the age of 16 and winning the Best Newcomer Award in the third season, you became the vice-captain in the first season. You only know how to play games and know nothing about the world.\u2019</p><br/><p>He really wanted to bully Cheng Wei from the beginning, thoroughly dyeing this piece of white paper black and making him beg for mercy\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Tan Shitian felt soft and reluctant when he saw Cheng Wei\u2019s simple appearance.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled. \u201cIn fact, you can try it. I will teach you free of charge. If I\u2019m not a good teacher then you don\u2019t need to have me as a teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei had a young man\u2019s heart after all and he was very curious about this. He always felt that Tan Shitian was planning something but his strong curiosity prevailed. What harm was there in learning from Tan Shitian? It was like Tan Shitian said. If he didn\u2019t learn then he might be abandoned by his girlfriend in the future!</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei blushed when he thought this and curiously asked, \u201cWill you? Then\u2026 try and teach me.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence was simply adding fuel to the fire for Tan Shitian. He originally endured the desire to kiss Cheng Wei but once he heard this, he decisively grabbed the back of Cheng Wei\u2019s head and leaned over to kiss him.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was stunned and by the time he reacted, Tan Shitian had already put his tongue in. The flexible tongue gently swept through the mouth, like dyeing white paper black, he left traces of himself everywhere in Cheng Wei\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian was also young but his kissing skills were quite superb. He had liked Cheng Wei for a long time and was naturally gentle and considerate to his beloved. He had to take care of every aspect.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was firmly kissed. He thought it would be disgusting but strangely, Tan Shitian\u2019s gentle touch made Cheng Wei feel particularly comfortable\u2026</p><br/><p>He even comfortably raised his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026mmm\u2026 hmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to his usual appearance, the current Cheng Wei looked like a confused kitten as he subconsciously made seductive sounds.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian\u2019s gaze became deeper until Cheng Wei was almost suffocated by the kiss. Then he suppressed his body\u2019s fierce reaction and put the brakes on in time, retreating from Cheng Wei.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei desperately gasped. Some time passed before his breathing calmed down and his sense of reason returned. Cheng Wei only just realized that he was kissed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhh! Tan Shitian, you\u2019re dead! How dare you kiss me? You son of a b\u2026\u201d Before he could finish, Tan Shitian smiled and gently blocked his mouth. He gently asked, \u201cAre you comfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei froze. He no longer talked and his cheeks turned red.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian whispered into his ears, \u201cThis is a kiss. Do you understand? If you don\u2019t understand then come find me at any time. There is no need to be embarrassed. Men exchanging experiences is nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei turned over and ignored him. He buried himself in the quilt and thought that today was really humiliating.</p><br/><p>However, Tan Shitian\u2019s kiss was really comfortable. Once he was kissed, Cheng Wei felt that his previous brain process was wrong. It felt like a door to a new world had been opened?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

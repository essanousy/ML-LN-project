After returning to the dormitory every night, Zhang Shaohui was able to sleep in Lou Wushuang\u2019s bedroom and hold him to sleep. Sometimes he could steal a few kisses when Lou Wushuang was in a good mood.</p><br/><p>However, that was it.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to make any further moves. The drunken experience must\u2019ve left a psychological shadow on Lou Wushuang and Zhang Shaohui was afraid that the relationship between the two people would be messed up because of old things.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui held his favourite person to sleep every night and endured it. He considered Lou Wushuang\u2019s feelings and forced himself to endure it. Besides, the season had started and there were many things that Lou Wushuang had to deal with in the Ghost Spirits team. Zhang Shaohui didn\u2019t want to take up too much time.</p><br/><p>The scene of the unconscious Lou Wushuang was still vivid in his mind. If he unknowingly hurt Lou Wushuang and affected the team\u2019s matches, Zhang Shaohui would definitely be drowned by the curses of the fans.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The days passed quietly and many members of Ghost Spirits noticed a subtle change in the relationship between the Lou Zhang brothers. In the past, Zhang Shaohui liked to follow behind Lou Wushuang. Now it was even worse. Lou Wushuang would go to the canteen every day at noon and Zhang Shaohui would actively prepare his favourite meal in advance. If Lou Wushuang went to the conference room to prepare for the pre-match meeting, Zhang Shaohui would always help him open the projection screen and connect the computer. If Lou Wushuang was tired from training in the afternoon, Zhang Shaohui would take the initiative to give him some coffee. Sometimes Zhang Shaohui would run downstairs in the middle of the night, thoughtfully giving Lou Wushuang his favourite drink.</p><br/><p>Manager Lin was relieved. \u201cThe feelings between you brothers is too good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s expression was calm but Zhang Shaohui scratched his head with a red face. \u201cHey, we have more than 10 years of feelings. We can\u2019t compare to good friends!\u201d His tone seemed rather smug.</p><br/><p>The newcomers secretly talked in private, \u201cI feel like Vice-Captain Zhang is like someone who follows the emperor in ancient times. Wherever the emperor goes, he has to arrange everything properly.</p><br/><p>Someone else retorted, \u201cVice-Captain Zhang is much more good-looking. This metaphor isn\u2019t appropriate!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey had a cold war not long ago. Vice-Captain Zhang would hide whenever he saw Captain Lou, just like a mouse seeing a cat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I really don\u2019t understand them. After a few days of a cold war, they reconciled and are stickier than before. It is just like glue.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe words \u2018like glue\u2019 seem to describe newlyweds. Is your metaphor wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am an e-sports player and there are no high standards for my language level\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The several newcomers were whispering together when a cold voice was heard behind them. \u201cAren\u2019t you training today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone immediately stiffened and sat like statues in front of the computer.</p><br/><p>Captain Lou rarely visited the training camp. Today he suddenly came and the newcomers were a bit flattered.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Zhang Shaohui smiled and helped them out. \u201cI just organized some friendly games for them. They worked hard for several days and I wanted them to relax today, telling them to play casually in the online game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s expression eased after hearing Zhang Shaohui\u2019s explanation and he spoke lightly, \u201cYou can\u2019t be too lax. Training might be boring but people who can\u2019t keep going will be eliminated one day.\u201d Then he sat down in front of a computer. \u201cCome and play in the arena with me. I want to see the results of your training.\u201d</p><br/><p>Captain Lou was too cold and rarely managed the camp. It was unknown what wind was blowing today but the newcomers immediately rushed over to PK with Captain Lou. Naturally, they were beaten by him one by one.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang frowned. \u201cYour actual combat awareness isn\u2019t enough. You need more practice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui told him, \u201cIn the future, I will come to the training camp to supervise their training. You have been playing all afternoon and must be tired. Do you want to go eat dinner first?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Lou Wushuang got up and let. Zhang Shaohui was following him to the door, only to look back and say, \u201cTomorrow, I will develop a new training plan. You have to finish it and don\u2019t be lazy, do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>The group immediately responded. \u201cWe hear you, Vice-Captain Zhang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui instantly turned around and caught up with Lou Wushuang.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The two people returned to their dormitory after dinner. Zhang Shaohui diligently cut a plate of fruit for his brother and asked, \u201cBrother, are you angry about the newcomers not training seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui scratched his head. \u201cYou can rest assured that I will look over the training camp more in the future. When the two of us were in the training camp, Master\u2019s requirements were very strict. I have been too relaxed with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang listened to Zhang Shaohui taking the initiative to admit his mistakes and his heart softened. \u201cDon\u2019t blame yourself. It is also inappropriate that I have never gone to the training camp despite being captain. I will go over there to check when I am free, giving more pressure to the newcomers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would be great.\u201d Zhang Shaohui smiled and gently held Lou Wushuang\u2019s hand. \u201cThere are many newcomers who admire you. They will be more motivated if you come to visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>They also went through the tough training camp in their teenage years. The first captain of Ghost Spirits, Mo Quan was particularly strict with his requirements. Sometimes they wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep when they didn\u2019t complete a training task.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang started with understanding nothing about the game and Zhang Shaohui taught him slowly. Thus, the two teenagers couldn\u2019t complete their master\u2019s tasks. They often stayed up late and night and would go out to find food when hungry.</p><br/><p>It was a very hard but warm time. They worked hard together for their dreams, encouraged each other and supported each other. In retrospect, Zhang Shaohui discovered that if Lou Wushuang hadn\u2019t accompanied him to the Ghost Spirits team then he might not be able to persist and gain today\u2019s achievements.</p><br/><p>For so many years, they accompanied each other and the feelings had long surpassed brotherhood. It was just that Zhang Shaohui was too dull and only now understood what Lou Wushuang\u2019s companionship meant.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui thought this and couldn\u2019t help reaching out to hug Lou Wushuang\u2019s waist, placing a chin on his shoulder. Zhang Shaohui whispered, \u201cIf fact, with your results, you might have a better development if you hadn\u2019t become an e-sports player. You gave up so much for me\u2026 thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang became pained at these words. He did a lot for Zhang Shaohui and Zhang Shaohui never understood it until now. Everything Lou Wushuang did wasn\u2019t in vain.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang gently hugged Zhang Shaohui and wondered, \u201cWhy are you talking like this today? It isn\u2019t like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui smiled. \u201cI went to the training camp with you this afternoon and suddenly remembered the days when we were together in the training camp. Then I discovered that I\u2026 am so stupid. You have been with me for so many years. It would\u2019ve been nice if I reacted earlier and made you my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s face reddened at the word \u2018wife\u2019 and he reprimanded, \u201cDon\u2019t call me that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Wushuang?\u201d Zhang Shaohui looked up with fiery eyes, stretching out a finger to rub against Lou Wushuang\u2019s lips and speaking in a low voice. \u201cOr should I continue calling you brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 um\u2026\u201d Lou Wushuang\u2019s lips were suddenly blocked by the kiss that caught him off guard. Zhang Shaohui\u2019s tongue went deep into his mouth and moved. Obviously, this guy\u2019s kissing skills had made great progress. Lou Wushuang was dizzy from the drunk and he couldn\u2019t help holding Zhang Shaohui\u2019s shoulders tightly.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After a long kiss, Zhang Shaohui didn\u2019t want to let this person go but he held back the impulses of his body and spoke hoarsely, \u201cBrother\u2026 um, forget it. We have to train tomorrow so you should go sleep early.\u201d Then he quickly rushed into the bathroom to take a cold shower.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang sat on the bed and didn\u2019t know if he should lay or cry. He actually wanted to say, \u2018Stupid, you don\u2019t have to be psychologically stressed. I am actually willing.\u2019</p><br/><p>However, Lou Wushuang always had a cold personality. How could he say these type of words?</p><br/><p>He heard the sound of water in the bathroom and Lou Wushuang had to rub his temple helplessly. Even so, he couldn\u2019t control the sweetness in his heart. He knew that Zhang Shaohui endured his thoughts because he respected Lou Wushuang.</p><br/><p>There were also many inconveniences about the team training room. It was better to wait for the off-season to return to the house. It was a small world that only belonged to them. They didn\u2019t have to worry about the manager, their teammates, training and the competition. The two people could indulge themselves in desire and joy\u2026</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang thought of this and couldn\u2019t help feeling some expectations.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Time flew quickly and in the blink of an eye, it was the holiday in the middle of the regular season.</p><br/><p>After the first round of the regular season, the Miracle League would give players 10 days off. In these 10 days, some peoples would go home to visit their families while others would go out to adjust their mood. The Ghost Spirits\u2019 place on the rankings wasn\u2019t bad and Lou Wushuang let everyone relax for a few days.</p><br/><p>The brothers returned to the house they bought in Shenzhen. The two bedroom house was small but very warm. It was a wedding house so it was filled with a sweet taste. The first time Zhang Shaohui came here, he wasn\u2019t nervous at all but now he finally understood the purpose behind Lou Wushuang buying this house.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang was changing shoes at the entrance when Zhang Shaohui suddenly hugged him from behind. \u201cYou bought this house in order to live with me? You had long planned to use it as our wedding house, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>A hint of embarrassment filled Lou Wushuang\u2019s face but it was quickly replaced by calm. \u201cIt seems that you aren\u2019t stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ve been with you for a long time and the stupid person will slowly become smarter.\u201d He kissed the white neck from behind, leaving a mark on it. Then he continued, \u201cI like this house very much but can we change the kid\u2019s room. Last time I argued with you and couldn\u2019t sleep in the room\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang listened to the complaints, thought about the man huddled on the small bed and felt funny. He touched the other person\u2019s head and replied, \u201cOkay, how do you want to change it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have a say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you are also the owner of this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence sounded particularly pleasant and Zhang Shaohui was excited. \u201cHow about changing it into a study? We can buy two computer tables side by side for when we want to both play in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang wondered, \u201cPlacing it against each other will save space. Why do you want it side by side?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui laughed. \u201cIf it is side by side then I can always pull your hand and also kiss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This idiot was too direct!</p><br/><p>However, Zhang Shaohui\u2019s next actions were even more straightforward. Lou Wushuang had just changed into slippers when Zhang Shaohui stretched out his long arms, one arm against the armpit and the other arm around Lou Wushuang\u2019s waist as Lou Wushuang was picked up.</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang was shocked and immediately grabbed Zhang Shaohui\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u2019</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui smirked. \u201cSince this is our wedding house, shouldn\u2019t we christen it this evening?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang felt funny and rubbed hard on Zhang Shaohui\u2019s head, speaking helplessly, \u201cYou are thinking things unsuitable for children all day long!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui looked innocent. \u201cI have been enduring it for a long time. Don\u2019t you want me at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lou Wushuang\u2019s heartbeat suddenly accelerated.</p><br/><p>Last time, Zhang Shaohui was drunk and his actions were too rough. There was no sense of scale. He only cared about satisfaction and it was painful for Lou Wushuang. Now that the two of them were in love, Lou Wushuang was looking forward to true lovemaking. No one could bother them and Lou Wushuang didn\u2019t want to waste this good opportunity. He gently kissed Zhang Shaohui\u2019s ear and whispered, \u201cI missed you too.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

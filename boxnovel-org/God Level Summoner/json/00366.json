As a result, Tan Shitian\u2019s phone suddenly rang. Cheng Wei saw that the name on the caller ID was Liu Xiang. Yesterday, he had been depressed because Tan Shitian and Liu Xiang were too close but Tan Shitian clearly explained things last night. Now Cheng Wei saw Liu Xiang\u2019s name and felt somewhat embarrassed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHello, Liu Xiang.\u201d Tan Shitian picked up the phone calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you had lunch with Xiao Wei? I found a special restaurant near your hotel. You invited us for dinner last night so I should invite you for a meal.\u201d Yang Muzi interjected next to her. \u201cTell them that the food in this restaurant is delicious! I\u2019ve been there once!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian looked at Cheng Wei and asked him what to do by mouthing it. Cheng Wei scratched his head and whispered, \u201cSince Captain Liu kindly invited us to eat, we should go. It is too impolite to refuse directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian nodded and replied on the phone. \u201cThank you, please send me the address and I\u2019ll come over with Xiao Wei.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up the phone and pinched Cheng Wei\u2019s face, asking in a low voice, \u201cAre you eating Liu Xiang\u2019s vinegar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was embarrassed and exclaimed angrily, \u201cWho is eating her vinegar? Don\u2019t talk nonsense! Captain Liu is an excellent female player. Why are you guys always dragging her out as cannon fodder?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian wanted to laugh but was afraid of Cheng Wei and forcibly held it back. He smiled and replied, \u201cOkay, I was wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was the usual bickering but the air seemed filled with a sweet flavour.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s heart beat faster and he turned to change his clothes. Previously in the dormitory, they were both boys and Cheng Wei hadn\u2019t been uncomfortable changing clothes in front of Tan Shitian. He took off his pyjamas and put on a simple t-shirt, not noticing that Tan Shitian was watching behind him.</p><br/><p>After changing his clothes, Cheng Wei turned back and wondered, \u201cAre we going now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian took a deep breath and smiled before taking Cheng Wei\u2019s hand. \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei felt somewhat awkward and wanted to pull his hand back but Tan Shitian held it tightly. Cheng Wei no longer struggled and headed to the restaurant with Tan Shitian.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>After arriving at the restaurant, they found out that Liu Xiang would leave Suzhou today to go to Hangzhou. The reason she invited Tan Cheng to lunch was also a polite farewell.</p><br/><p>The private room had already been booked and Yang Muzi warmly invited the two people to sit down. Tan Shitian was worried that Cheng Wei would be unhappy and deliberately separated from Liu Xiang with an empty seat. He sat to Cheng Wei\u2019s side and thoughtfully passed the dishes to Cheng Wei. He even peeled crab meat and placed it on Cheng Wei\u2019s plate.</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang smiled and said, \u201cCaptain Tan really takes care of people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian explained, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t peel crabs. Previously in the Time team, he tried to eat crabs and made a mess, but he couldn\u2019t obtain much meat. He struggled with the crab legs and I was almost anxious to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s face turned red as he glared at Tan Shitian. \u201cCan you not mention my black history!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian immediately made a zipping gesture at his mouth and said, \u201cOkay, I won\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Xiang saw this scene and couldn\u2019t help laughing. There were rumours online that Tan Cheng didn\u2019t agree and often argued. Now it seemed that Tan Shitian was always protecting Cheng Wei. Cheng Wei was more straightforward and didn\u2019t consider the consequences while Tan Shitian was gentle and tolerate. Their personalities actually fit well.</p><br/><p>After lunch, Liu Xiang took the initiative to pay the bill. They separated at the restaurant door. The female members of Red Fox headed to the station together while Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei went to see the famous Humble Administrator\u2019s Garden in Suzhou Gardens.</p><br/><p>There were many tourists. They were all strangers but it would be difficult if people familiar with Miracle recognized the two of them. If they saw the two people holding hands, it would be very troublesome to explain. Tan Shitian was always measured when doing things and didn\u2019t hold Cheng Wei\u2019s hand in the crowd. The two men walked next to each other like ordinary friends and took photos when they met beautiful sights.</p><br/><p>Usually, they were facing the computer all day and it was difficult to relax. Cheng Wei was very excited and held his phone to take photos non-stop. Tan Shitian saw his energetic appearance and couldn\u2019t help smiling. In fact, the actual Cheng Wei was an easy person. Just give him something to eat and occasionally take him out to play and he would be particularly happy.</p><br/><p>He was easy to satisfy. He had no ambition and didn\u2019t care about luxury. Such a person lived simply and happily and this was the part Tan Shitian liked most about him. Tan Shitian liked to see Cheng Wei happy. This type of Cheng Wei made Tan Shitian feel that his mood was particularly clear, just like the blue sky above him.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The journey plan was 10 days. The two people played in Suzhou for a few days before diverting to Yangzhou and Hangzhou to have fun.</p><br/><p>Once the journey was over, Tan Shitian took Cheng Wei back to Beijing. For the full 10 day trip, Cheng Wei didn\u2019t need to worry about anything regarding tickets, hotels, attractions and places to eat. He just needed to follow Tan Shitian.</p><br/><p>Sitting on the plane back to Beijing, the biggest feeling in Cheng Wei\u2019s heart was that Tan Shitian was a very considerate person. It was really comfortable being with him!</p><br/><p>The club was on holiday so returning to the dormitory wasn\u2019t convenient. Tan Shitian thought about it and suggested, \u201cIn any case, the team will start training in two weeks. Do you want to go to my place to stay for a few days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was a bit embarrassed. \u201cYour place? How will I explain to your parents\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian smiled. \u201cMy parents aren\u2019t in Beijing. I live alone in my house so you don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei immediately became happy after hearing this and promised, \u201cOkay, I haven\u2019t been to your home yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei followed Tan Shitian to a community with high-rise buildings that had over 30 floors. Cheng Wei might not understand Beijing\u2019s housing prices but he could guess that a house here wasn\u2019t cheap. In the end, Cheng Wei didn\u2019t ask if Tan Shitian\u2019s parents had given him this place or if he bought it himself. Cheng Wei just followed Tan Shitian into the elevator to the 30th floor.</p><br/><p>The two bedroom, one bathroom house was decorated in a very simple style. The pictures hanging in the living room matched the surrounding furniture and was obviously chosen by the owner. The bedroom was very comfortable and warm. Apart from the large double bed and tailored wardrobe, there were no extra decorations. It was warm and simple.</p><br/><p>There was also a room that was furnished as a study. The design of the study was simple and elegant. After entering, a desk with two soft chairs could be seen. The opposite side of the table contained a bookcase that occupied a whole wall. It was full of books and famous titles all over the world could be seen in one glance.</p><br/><p>After looking around the place, Cheng Wei returned to the door of the study and was surprised. \u201cDo you like reading books?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian replied, \u201cYes, I usually take a look when I am free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s face was full of admiration. \u201cNo wonder why you know so much. I don\u2019t like reading books. When I was young, I fell asleep as soon as I read any books.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian imagining him holding a book and dozing off and couldn\u2019t help rubbing Cheng Wei\u2019s head. \u201cYou must\u2019ve always been beaten up as a kid for being naughty, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was embarrassed. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian just smiled at him. \u201cPut away your luggage first and take a shower. I\u2019ll go prepare dinner.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>By the time Cheng Wei came out of the shower, a hearty meal had been set up in the dining room.</p><br/><p>The two people ate facing each other and Cheng Wei was feeling particularly satisfied. He really wanted to be together with Tan Shitian like this.</p><br/><p>At 10 o\u2019clock in the evening, Tan Shitian finished taking a shower and found that Cheng Wei was wandering around the house. He asked in a puzzled manner, \u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei walked over. \u201cWhere will I sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian told him, \u201cSleep in the bedroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen where will you sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian finally understood his thoughts and smiled. \u201cI will also sleep in the bedroom. The bed is big enough, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei just nodded. \u201cThen I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them walked into the bedroom. Cheng Wei was lying in bed and about to go to sleep when Tan Shitian suddenly hugged him from behind.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s heart beat like a drum and he was too stiff to move.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian whispered, \u201cXiao Wei, I want to kiss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This gentle voice couldn\u2019t be refused at all. In any case, it wasn\u2019t the first time kissing. Cheng Wei turned around and said with a red face, \u201cThis time I will kiss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had been \u2018taught\u2019 many times and Cheng Wei was eager to take the initiative. Tan Shitian heard this and his eyes lit up. His hands clung to Cheng Wei and he smiled. \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei was excited and kissed him with a curious attitude. His movements were raw and bit rough but this simple kiss instantly ignited Tan Shitian\u2019s desire that he had been suppressing for a long time.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The next part has been censored.

He couldn\u2019t help kissing Cheng Wei\u2019s red lips and declared softly, \u201cXiao Wei, I love you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He finally had Cheng Wei.</p><br/><p>In the future, he would use his full strength to protect the lover who trusted him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

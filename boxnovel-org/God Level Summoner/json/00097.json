Xiao Han\u2019s PK skills were becoming more refined thanks to Qin Mo changing to numerous side accounts every day to train Xiao Han. In particular, his grasp of the assassin\u2019s stealth skill had reached the point of perfection. Qin Mo was surprised to find that it wasn\u2019t easy to defeat Xiao Han now.</p><br/><p>After the end of the sixth season, the Wind Colour got a holiday for one month. Qin Mo planned to go back home to Xi\u2019an to visit his parents. As a competent sparring partner, he decided to say goodbye to Xiao Han before he left.</p><br/><p>That night, Xiao Han found that someone was online in the \u2018schizophrenia group\u2019 in his friends\u2019 list and he immediately sent a private message: [Qin Mo, arena?]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo thought, \u2018I have played so many rounds with you and had to pay you gold for every round. Whenever I come online, you will say words like \u2018arena?\u2019 Do I have no human rights?\u2019</p><br/><p>Qin Mo thought this and said: [I won\u2019t go.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was puzzled. [Why?]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo replied angrily: [There is no reason. I just don\u2019t want to fight with you!]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han said seriously: [Are you afraid you won\u2019t beat me if we fight again?]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Who said he couldn\u2019t beat Xiao Han?</p><br/><p>Qin Mo was stimulated by this method and immediately found the president of Wind Colour to ask for money. Popular Land Under Heaven couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cLoser Little Prince, the team is on holiday and you still won\u2019t let go of my vault?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Mo asked the president for 10,000 gold and PKed with Xiao Han for 10 rounds. Once they finished, he said: [Look, I can beat you.]</p><br/><p>Xiao Han: [Yes, thank you for the training.]</p><br/><p>Qin Mo, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Damn it, he was fooled! He ended up sparring and gave Xiao Han another 10,000 gold coins!</p><br/><p>The depressed Qin Mo shut off his computer and decided that he would ignore Xiao Han during his one month holiday!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The sixth season ended and the Miracle League gave professional players a one month holiday. Most players actively went home to visit their loved ones. However, the captains weren\u2019t so leisurely.</p><br/><p>Shortly after the awards ceremony, Chairman Nan Jiangang convened all the team captains of the first and second division in Beijing. The first division had eight teams and the second division had sixteen teams. In total, there were 24 captains. All of them sat around the conference table.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan Jiangang asked the assistant to distribute the documents to everyone. Then he started speaking seriously, \u201cThere are two reasons for today\u2019s meeting. First, the rules of the seventh season will be completely changed. There are detailed descriptions in the file. You can look at it first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The captains looked down at the documents. After a while, Ling Xuefeng looked up and asked, \u201cChairman, the seventh season will cancel the single-elimination arena system and change it into a partner matchup. Is this in line with the World Competition?\u201d</p><br/><p>The question raised by Ling Xuefeng was a common doubt in the hearts of the other captains.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan Jiangang nodded and said, \u201cNext year\u2019s World Competition will indeed have a partner matchup elimination system. The World League\u2019s idea is that the single-player system is too unstable. If a team has one or two very strong guards, they will gain a lot of points in the arena stage, which isn\u2019t fair to the other teams. Since Miracle is a team game, more attention should be paid to the ability to cooperate. That is the purpose behind replacing one person with partners.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group nodded. In other words, there would be no single-player confrontations in the seventh season. It would be a confrontation between combinations.</p><br/><p>For example, let\u2019s say there was a match between Time and Flying Feathers. In the past, the two sides would send three players to the arena in a 1v1 elimination style battle. The person who survived until the end would gain the points. In the seventh season, the arena would take the form of combination VS combination. Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei could form a combination and Flying Feathers had the double melee combination of Yu Pingsheng and Su Guangmo. A player\u2019s individual strength would be weakened and the role of cooperation between partners significantly increased.</p><br/><p>Then Su Guangmo asked, \u201cAccording to the description in the file, the regular season only has one round of the arena. In the playoffs, if there are three consecutive rounds, you can change people in the middle. This meaning\u2026 you can change one person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Nan Jiangang explained. \u201cLet\u2019s take the Wind Colour team as an example. The first round can have the Guo Xuan and Yan Ruiwen combination, the second round can have the Xu Feifan and Ling Xuefeng double summoning combination and then the combination of Ling Xuefeng and Yan Ruiwen can play in the third round. It can be a single or double change, allowing a high degree of freedom. Once you go back, you have to study carefully about how to arrange your lineup.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was interesting because every team had a special ace combination. In addition to this fixed combination, they could use other teammates to create a unique style of play. If necessary, they could even bring a healer to the arena.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan Jiangang continued explaining, \u201cThere is still the second matter about the establishment of the national team for the World Competition. The maximum number of players and the selection methods have been included in the file. Take a closer look. If you don\u2019t understand anything, you can ask me directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The meeting lasted for two hours and the captains had a very lively discussion.</p><br/><p>Chairman Nan Jiangang looked at the eagerness of these young people and was particularly pleased. He believed that the seventh season would definitely be more exciting than any season in the past.</p><br/><p>Once the meeting ended, Nan Jiangang was left alone with Ling Xuefeng and he asked, \u201cHow is Old Cat\u2019s progress?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied, \u201cHe opened a cross-server arena challenge to recruit teammates. However, he hasn\u2019t found anyone yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nan Jiangang frowned. \u201cThe second division will start after the Spring Festival next year. Once he finds teammates, he has to train them. He doesn\u2019t have a lot of time. Tell him to speed up his progress!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cRest assured, Chairman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng returned to his hotel and immediately turned on his computer. He logged into his Q account and sent a message to Li Cangyu. [The chairman asked about your team today. Has the situation progressed on your side?]</p><br/><p>[Not for the moment.] Li Cangyu replied. [Qin Mo gave my Xiao Han half a month\u2019s worth of training and his PK level has grown considerably. There are very few people who can defeat him. Occasionally, there are one or two but they aren\u2019t interested in playing competitively.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng wondered: [Have you considered my suggestion? Exposing your identity and using it to recruit teammates will be more useful than the one million bonus that you set.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. [I am planning to do so.]</p><br/><p>Then he asked with concerned: [Didn\u2019t you have a meeting in Beijing today?]</p><br/><p>[Yes, today\u2019s meeting was about the change in the competition system and the national team\u2019s selection. I\u2019ll send it for you to look.] He used his phone to take photos of the files and uploaded them to Q.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu sent a hug emoji and looked thoughtfully at the files.</p><br/><p>10 minutes later, Li Cangyu finished reading about the new system and was somewhat puzzled. [The single-player elimination is cancelled and it will become a combination arena?]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng: [Yes.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [Okay, then I can try a combination with Xiao Bai. Output + Milk Dad.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew this would happen!</p><br/><p>If Li Cangyu really formed a team with Bai Xuan, it was estimated that many people would cry in the future. Cat God protected by the milk dad was simply unstoppable. He wouldn\u2019t be able to die and there would be a collective protest.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu continued with: [Can the two of us form a combination in the World Competition?]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was slightly moved and asked: [Don\u2019t you want to bring your Milk Dad?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu sent a smiling emoji. [I want to take you even more.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Was this person being intentional or unintentional?</p><br/><p>There was a moment of silence and then Ling Xuefeng asked: [Why do you want to form a combination with me?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu: [Because you are handsome.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu unconsciously teased Ling Xuefeng, unaware that on the other side of the computer, Ling Xuefeng was once again smiling.</p><br/><p>[Then you want to combine with me and rely on my face to kill the opponents?] Ling Xuefeng typed.</p><br/><p>[Don\u2019t you think the two of us can dominate the world, regardless of whether we depend on our face or our strength?] Li Cangyu replied quite seriously.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s smile deepened and his eyes softened. [Don\u2019t think too far ahead. You need to quickly find teammates and play well in the domestic league before talking about the national team.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu sent an \u2018OK\u2019 gesture. [Rest assured. I will move step by step.]</p><br/><p>Then a dialogue window popped up in the lower right corner. It was from Zhang Jueming.</p><br/><p>[Cat God, I found a very interesting person in the arena. Do you want to come and see?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu quickly typed: [Okay, I\u2019ll be right there.]</p><br/><p>Chatting with Ling Xuefeng made him happy but there was a more pressing matter at present. Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng waved goodbye. Then Li Cangyu logged into the game and went to the cross-server arena to find Zhang Jueming.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming had been following Cat God\u2019s instructions and taking Xiao Gu to play in the cross-server arena.</p><br/><p>The cross-server arena was graded according to the player\u2019s points and winning percentage. Opponents of the same level would be matched. Once the points were full, there would be a promotion and the player could enter a higher level area.</p><br/><p>From lowest to highest, the ranks of the arena were: bronze, silver, gold, diamond and king.</p><br/><p>Most players in the bronze section were rookies and those with terrible hand speed. The silver section had average players. Masters in the online game would usually reach the gold and diamond section while the king section was obvious. It was basically the section for the side accounts of the professional players.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming met a person in the qualifying session of the bronze section.</p><br/><p>Anyone playing the arena knew that the bronze section had a mix of elementary school students and rookies. However, it was also possible to encounter some masters training their side accounts from scratch.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming knew instantly that this person was a master practicing a side account.</p><br/><p>On that day, he opened a healer account while Gu Siming played a psychic side account. This was to let Xiao Gu become familiar with the operations of the psychic. The two of them joined a random matching queue and were successfully assigned to a room.</p><br/><p>It was the bronze section so Zhang Jueming and Gu Siming could easily crush players. Yet in this match, they encountered an incident.</p><br/><p>Their team had a rookie who couldn\u2019t play and died six times in a row to the opposite team\u2019s black magician. The black magician relied on the 30% status bonus from the six kills to wipe out the team in one breath and successfully grabbed the crystal.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming was a healer and Xiao Gu was an auxiliary. The two watched as their teammates were killed and couldn\u2019t help. They could only lose in a depressed manner. This was the first time that they saw the word \u2018failure\u2019 in the bronze section.</p><br/><p>After this match, Xiao Gu said, \u201cThe black magician has a good awareness. He is definitely playing a side account!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming had previously been a captain and naturally saw that this black magician wasn\u2019t simple and wanted to add him as a friend.</p><br/><p>This person\u2019s ID was Don\u2019t Like to Talk. Zhang Jueming sent the message: [Let\u2019s become friends to team up together.]</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t Like to Talk: [Okay.]</p><br/><p>Thus, Zhang and Gu formed a team with him. They played 10 games in a row and naturally won the 10 games.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming teamed up with the black magician to see his true level. The more he saw, the more shocked he became. This person\u2019s awareness was first-class and he was also capable of grasping opportunities.</p><br/><p>The black magician was a dark magic class. The most important thing was the negative effect of the Death Mantra. Under this spell, the black magician\u2019s attack skills would receive a damage bonus. Many black magicians didn\u2019t know how to connect spells but this person did it very well. His grasp of the spell cooldowns was simply perfect.</p><br/><p>However, he was like his ID \u2018Don\u2019t Like to Talk.\u2019 He rarely spoke. Whenever he was asked something, he would reply with short words. He never took the initiative to send a message.</p><br/><p>In order to avoid scaring him, Zhang Jueming temporarily didn\u2019t tell him about the formation of the day. He teamed up with the black magician for three or four days to make sure this person had potential before telling the captain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Li Cangyu pulled a chair over and sat next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is no problem for you to be selected for the Carnival.\u201d Li Cangyu declared with great confidence as he put an arm around Ling Xuefeng\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYour popularity is so high. If I\u2019m not mistaken, you will be in first place in the voting.\u201d</p><br/><p>The voting interface opened in front of them and Wind Colour\u2019s captain, Ling Xuefeng was currently in first place.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked back at the other person and found that Li Cangyu was happier than him. Li Cangyu touched his chin and said, \u201cI guessed correct. The eyes of the audience are high and they know your strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled slightly as he held Li Cangyu\u2019s hand that was on his shoulder. \u201cYour strength isn\u2019t weak. This time you should be able to enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Li Cangyu asked with some doubt and shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve been away from the league for three years and I\u2019m not more popular than the players who have been fighting in the league. This Carnival has only 12 places and I shouldn\u2019t make it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot necessarily. Take a look first.\u201d Ling Xuefeng scrolled down to see the rankings of the other votes.</p><br/><p>The voting time for the Chinese Carnival was until 24 o\u2019clock on Tuesday. For the current voting poll, the top three were occupied by the three highly popular players of Ling, Su and Tan. The fourth was Lou Wushuang of Ghost Spirits. This was because the team performed well recently and the captain himself had high popularity. He gained new fans who voted for him.</p><br/><p>In addition, Red Fox\u2019s Liu Xiang was a regular visitor on the popular list. Pure Cleansing\u2019s captain Chu Yan was the best auxiliary psychic in China and his votes didn\u2019t fall. Then there was Wind Colour\u2019s vice-captain Yan Ruiwen, Flying Feathers\u2019 vice-captain Yu Pingsheng, Time\u2019s vice-captain Cheng Wei, Ghost Spirits\u2019 vice-captain Zhang Shaohui\u2026</p><br/><p>Then Ling Xuefeng saw the name Li Cangyu followed by Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>He carefully counted it from the beginning and said with certainty, \u201cYou are currently ranked 11th and Bai Xuan is 12th. There are still a few hours left in the voting. It is better to make a Weibo post so you aren\u2019t overtaken by the people behind you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind him was Pure Cleansing\u2019s crybaby Zhu Qingyue and Red Fox\u2019s vice-captain Yang Muzi as well as Cheetah\u2019s captain Jiang Xu. Their votes were close and the possibility of some senior fans deliberately holding back tickets to vote at the last minute couldn\u2019t be eliminated.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu felt surprised. \u201cBai Xuan and I could actually make it into the top 12? Canglan has that many fans?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng explained, \u201cCanglan has done well in recent matches and you publicly said that you want to enter the world summoner\u2019s list. Many people yelled at you for bragging but there are also many people who like you and paid attention to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu touched his nose. \u201cIt turned out to be like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t care too much about popularity or being selected for the Carnival. The Carnival was originally an entertainment project and it didn\u2019t matter if some of the most popular gods were chosen to play together for two days.</p><br/><p>However, Li Cangyu was quite happy about the affirmation of his fans. He logged into Weibo and sent a message: [I am very surprised that my votes can exceed 10,000. Thank you for voting. I don\u2019t mind if I participate in the Carnival or not. It is the next match that matters and I\u2019m not going to let the people who support me down.]</p><br/><p>He had always been blunt when speaking and didn\u2019t sell his popularity on a public platform like some players. Still, his honest and refreshing words made the fans who liked him more determined.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s Weibo soon got thousands of replies. [Cat God is really domineering. I will give you a bunch of dried fish as a reward!] [Cat God, I really want to be your shovel!] [Cat God, my ticket has been cast!] [On behalf of the Canglan Support group, many people just registered on the forum and aren\u2019t eligible to vote. Everyone is trying their best and next time it will be higher!]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu became more surprised the more he looked, especially by the comment of the \u2018Canglan Support group.\u2019 He couldn\u2019t help replying curiously: [What group is the Canglan Support group? Did you build it yourself?]</p><br/><p>The fan who got the response was so excited that she wanted to go downstairs and run two laps. She took a deep breath to calm down before replying: [Captain! Your loyal fans privately built the group. The owner is @Sister Shasha who has liked you since she was in school. Everyone is really happy that you returned to Miracle!]</p><br/><p>Some people came forward to say: [Cat God, I have been paying attention to you since the second season and really like the elf summoner. I haven\u2019t played since you left Miracle. I heard you are back and built a side account in the new district. I can\u2019t play like you but watching you play is very cool!]</p><br/><p>[I didn\u2019t know about Cat God until you moved to Wulin. It is because of you that I found out about Miracle! I really like your decisiveness and you look very handsome. This is the important point. I am a face devotee!]</p><br/><p>[It isn\u2019t easy for Old Cat to persist for so many years. I have pulled all my friends and relatives to vote for you. I\u2019m not asking for anything else. I just want to let everyone know that you are qualified to stand on the Carnival stage!]</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was a big man but his eyes became hot when he saw these comments.</p><br/><p>He remembered the person called Shasha seven years ago. He also remember that the Miracle League of that time wasn\u2019t as prosperous as it was now. The number of fans for every team wasn\u2019t as high. In particular, the FTD team did badly and barely had support thanks to Li Cangyu and Bai Xuan. However, there were always a few people who cheered for the FTD team whenever they played.</p><br/><p>Later, Li Cangyu met with them and the leader of the group had an ID called Shasha. She was a university student. Her nature was very hearty and she liked tying her hair in a handsome ponytail. When she first met Li Cangyu, she gave him a model of a big cat and smiled. \u201cCaptain, cheer up. Even if your performance now isn\u2019t good, we believe that one day you will stand on the highest podium in Miracle!\u201d</p><br/><p>This simple sentence was undoubtedly the biggest inspiration for the young Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>A few years had passed. Li Cangyu didn\u2019t think she would come back and re-establish the support group.</p><br/><p>There were also many fans who knew him from Wulin and merged with the Miracle fans. There were the old players who liked elf summoners and returned because of his return\u2026</p><br/><p>Everything was shocking and made him feel moved.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t think he would have so many loyal fans.</p><br/><p>Today, in order to vote, the old Cat God loyal fans that were hidden for many years all came out. In particularly, the appearance of old friends who he met in the first season made Li Cangyu feel particularly pleased.</p><br/><p>He found Shasha on Weibo and sent her a private chat. [Shasha? Did you build the Canglan Support group?]</p><br/><p>The other person quickly replied: [Captain is well! I can\u2019t say it is new. This group has always been there! Most of the administrators are veterans who have watched you play since the first season. Everyone is very happy that you came back. Recently, many new fans have been added and the current group is full and very lively. I\u2019m planning to open a sub-group.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wrote emotionally: [I haven\u2019t seen you for a few years. I thought you left Miracle a long time ago!]</p><br/><p>Shasha replied: [There are some friends who have left but there are also many who stayed. Like Lei Shao, Xiao Yang and Bubu, they are a few you saw in the past. We are usually low-key and afraid to cause you trouble. Now we don\u2019t need to hide because the contestant we like will stand on the world podium! Isn\u2019t that right?]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was even more moved when he saw this. [Thank you.]</p><br/><p>He was really grateful to those who silently supported him for a long time.</p><br/><p>In the past, he hadn\u2019t been able to get good results but this group didn\u2019t give up on him. It was the so called \u2018true sentiments are seen in hard times\u2019. These fans were very pure and sincere toward him. Their encouragement and support was his greatest motivation.</p><br/><p>Shasha was the leader of the FTD Support group. The Lei Shao, Xiao Yang and Bubu she mentioned were veteran players of Miracle. They were dead loyal fans of the elf summoner and Bai Xuan who played a healer. During FTD\u2019s most difficult period, they personally went to the matches to cheer for Li Cangyu. He didn\u2019t expect them to still be here after so many years!</p><br/><p>As Shasha said: [The contestant will like will one day stand on the world podium!]</p><br/><p>Yes, Old Cat would one day make them proud of liking him!</p><br/><p>[Our fan club was privately built for Cat God but you can rest assured that we will take care. We won\u2019t smear other players or cause you trouble.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was naturally 100% reassured at his fan club being managed by this group of elders. He immediately replied: [Okay, work hard. Give everyone my thanks and I won\u2019t let you down!]</p><br/><p>Shasha took a screenshot of Cat God\u2019s words and sent them to people in the group. The fans immediately cheered. The feeling of being recognized by their idol was really great and everyone became more motivated to vote!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The conversation between Li Cangyu and his fans was seen by Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>He also had an impression of this person called Shasha. Many years ago, she came with several fans to encourage Li Cangyu when FTD was defeated. She sent a plush cat model to Li Cangyu and gave a present to Bai Xuan. Li Cangyu must be very happy about these old fans still being here.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu rarely cared about his popularity and he attracted a lot of controversy by switching games but no player could completely ignore outside evaluations. The fans who liked him and supported him would be the greatest encouragement and comfort.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw Li Cangyu\u2019s touched appearance and gently reached out to hug him. Ling Xuefeng\u2019s fingers slowly stroked his back. \u201cThey are still\u2026 I\u2019m still here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and hugged Ling Xuefeng. This really was his home and it was good that he could come back!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

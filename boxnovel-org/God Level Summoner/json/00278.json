As a result, their masters were wiped out and the Japanese team was embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Captain Sato\u2019s face was as dark as a pot. This time they sent all their great gods while thinking the Chinese team would send a few newcomers. If they could win this friendly match, it would give the players some confidence. The result was that they were beaten 9:2. It was too far-fetched to be explained as just the map advantage.</p><br/><p>Sato Takashi was thinking about how to spin this when Fujita Rika took the initiative to break the awkward atmosphere. She looked back at Sato Takashi and said, \u201cCaptain, many of the Chinese members participating in the World Competition can\u2019t be found in the world rankings, indicating that they deliberately hid their strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d There was immediate agreement. \u201cThe archer Tenday and the elf summoner Old Cat have never been heard of before and we were too careless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fujita Rika nodded. \u201cAccording to my investigation, the elf summoner called Old Cat is an old player who debuted in the first season of the Chinese Miracle League. He has been unknown for a few years because he ran to another game to play.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe ran to another game?\u201d Sato was a bit surprised. \u201cNo wonder why I\u2019ve never heard of him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There were also players who changed games on the Japanese side but they normally weren\u2019t great players. Therefore, Fujita Rika initially thought that Li Cangyu was at a normal level and changed games when he didn\u2019t succeed. Now it seemed that things weren\u2019t as simple as she imagined.</p><br/><p>Everyone was silent for a moment before Sato Takashi said seriously, \u201cToday\u2019s game against the Chinese team, I hope that everyone can keep it a secret and not mention it to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being beaten 9:2 was too shameful to say and the Chinese team was assigned to Group B while the Japanese team was in Group A. Exposing the Chinese team\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t good for the Japanese team. The World Competition was highly competitive. Since the Chinese team was a dark horse, they would definitely destroy the teams of other countries. Sato Takashi was happy to see it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverybody, get ready for the next match.\u201d Vice-Captain Fujita Rika changed the topic. \u201cOur next match is against the US team. They are the team with the highest chance of winning the World Competition. We must be careful when dealing with them!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At this time, Bai Xuan was having a dream. He was in the game and all his teammates had residual blood. He needed to explode his hand speed and brush up everyone\u2019s blood as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan felt a bit anxious. He took Xie Shurong\u2019s hand as the keyboard and pressed hard, his mouth saying, \u201cBig Healing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Xie Shurong gently grasped the slender fingers and sent him a funny look. He whispered in Bai Xuan\u2019s ears, \u201cYou are a competent milk dad. Are you still adding blood to people in your dream?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s fingers were caught and the keyboard in his dream seemed broken. He couldn\u2019t press it and couldn\u2019t help frowning.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong raised the fingers to his lips and gently kissed them. Bai Xuan felt itchy and doubtfully opened his eyes. He saw Xie Shurong holding his hand and smiling at him.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s face became hot and he wanted to pull his hand back, but it was held tighter by Xie Shurong.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese hands are so beautiful.\u201d Xie Shurong kissed the fingertips before stretching out his tongue to lick them. He looked at Bai Xuan with a burning gaze. \u201cThe blood-adding technique of your hands is incredible. I always feel that as long as you are present, I won\u2019t die no matter how many enemies there are.\u201d</p><br/><p>His fingers were wet with a young man\u2019s saliva and Bai Xuan\u2019s face was red. He pulled his hand back and wiped it, quietly asking, \u201cWhat time is it?\u201d As he spoke, he sat up, grabbed his phone from the bedside table and looked at the time. Then he turned back with surprise, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wake me at 3 o\u2019clock?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong asked him, \u201cIs your stomach better?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan slept for a while and his stomach wasn\u2019t as uncomfortable as it was at noon. However, the food still wasn\u2019t fully digested and felt like a cold stone in his stomach.</p><br/><p>Still, there was the next match\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong seemed to read his thoughts and held Bai Xuan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I asked Cat God for a break. Cat God said that if you aren\u2019t comfortable, you can rest and not play in the next match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be strong.\u201d Xie Shurong interrupted him. \u201cThere are still many matches to follow. It isn\u2019t a big deal to take a break. Liu Xiang can play if you aren\u2019t there. It is enough to only have a healer in the team economic battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan still wanted to argue but was interrupted by the other person again. \u201cBesides, if you are in a bad state during the game then you won\u2019t be able to keep up with the rhythm and it will affect your teammates. It is better to raise your spirits before playing the game, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan didn\u2019t expect this guy\u2019s mouth to be so slick. His words really made sense\u2026</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan had to lose the battle. \u201cOkay. My stomach is still uncomfortable. Once I am completely fine, I will tell Old Cat to send me to play. Liu Xiang\u2019s blood adding technique isn\u2019t worse than mine. There should be no problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong sighed with relief and kissed Bai Xuan\u2019s forehead. \u201cLet\u2019s have a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan helplessly couldn\u2019t move during the kiss. He was held in Ah Shu\u2019s arms and felt particularly warm. It was probably because Bai Xuan\u2019s body temperature was high and the whole bed was warm, making people not want to get out at all. Bai Xuan closed his eyes and kept leaning on him.</p><br/><p>There was a pounding heartbeat coming from the chest. Under the strong muscles, the young heart was pounding fiercely. It jumped so fast that it almost broke the eardrums.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan didn\u2019t want to listen to it. He couldn\u2019t help turning his head and saying, \u201cYour heart is beating so fast\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong smiled very brightly. \u201cI am holding you, my heartbeat will naturally become faster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was embarrassed by his bluntness and wanted to turn his head. However, his jaw was raised and a gentle kiss imprinted on Bai Xuan\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong finished the kiss and asked seriously, \u201cIs your heart beating faster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to kick this guy out of bed! Even so, his heartbeat really did become faster after he was kissed\u2026</p><br/><p>He looked up and saw Xie Shurong\u2019s bright eyes starting softly. They were clearly filled with a desire for an answer. Bai Xuan\u2019s heart softened and he said with a red face, \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble. I will lie down for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he took the initiative to lie down on Xie Shurong\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>The excited Xie Shurong immediately reached out and hugged him. His right hand was on Bai Xuan\u2019s chest, as if trying to test the other person\u2019s heartbeat. \u201cYour heartbeat is faster, right? Are you tempted by me? Hey, it is really faster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan slapped his hand away. \u201cShut up, you\u2019re noisy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong immediately closed his mouth. He saw Bai Xuan\u2019s red face and his mouth rose uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The two people lay together while listening to each other\u2019s heartbeats. Suddenly, the sound of the doorbell ringing was heard. Xie Shurong got out of bed and opened the door with a dark face. He unexpectedly saw Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng standing next to each other while Tan Shitian and Cheng Wei were behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Xiao Bai okay?\u201d Li Cangyu had a straightforward personality and he directly bypassed Xie Shurong to enter the room.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was busy tidying his clothes. He had just slept in Xie Shurong\u2019s arms and his clothes became a mess. Moreover, Xie Shurong had lifted up his pyjamas while trying to feel Bai Xuan\u2019s heartbeat.</p><br/><p>This awkward look was seen by everyone entering the room.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan wanted to grab Xie Shurong and remove him!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian coughed and smartly dragged away the curious Cheng Wei. Ling Xuefeng glanced at Xie Shurong while frowning slightly.</p><br/><p>However, Li Cangyu had thick nerves and didn\u2019t seem to notice anything strange. He walked over and sat next to Bai Xuan, placing a hand on Bai Xuan\u2019s forehead. \u201cYour face is so red. Do you have a fever?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan gave an embarrassed smile. \u201cNo, my stomach isn\u2019t very comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was very clear about the physical condition of his old partner. He had given Bai Xuan some Chinese medicine half a year before and Bai Xuan\u2019s stomach problem wasn\u2019t as serious as it was in the beginning. Still, a stomach illness wasn\u2019t something that could be healed in a day or two. This time, he went aboard and ate things he wasn\u2019t accustomed to. Li Cangyu thought this and had Bai Xuan lie down, placing the quilt over him. His voice was also very gentle. \u201cSince your stomach isn\u2019t comfortable, you should keep resting. I won\u2019t send you in the next game.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled. \u201cYes. I will improve my spirits and be on standby for the next match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu gently patted his shoulder. \u201cThere are many players in the national team and there is always an appropriate lineup. Don\u2019t feel too much pressure and rest peacefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei saw this scene from where he was standing beside the door and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cCat God and Vice-Captain Bai\u2019s feelings are really good!\u201d</p><br/><p>At these words, Ling Xuefeng and Xie Shurong\u2019s cold eyes shot towards him at the same time. Cheng Wei made a confused expression while Tan Shitian reluctantly pulled him away. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the training room first. We can\u2019t help here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Ling Xuefeng knew that Li Cangyu and Bai Xuan were partners for many years and their relationship was good, he couldn\u2019t help feeling unhappy when he saw this scene. Xie Shurong naturally wasn\u2019t happy. The vinegar smell in the air almost drowned the two people.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Bai Xuan didn\u2019t detect this at all as they kept speaking on the bed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the lineup for Spain set?\u201d Bai Xuan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t decided yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was a bit surprised. \u201cDidn\u2019t you decide at the 3 o\u2019clock meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cIt was originally planned but the Japanese team suddenly came to the door to provoke us. We had a friendly game against the Japanese team and the meeting was delayed. I was worried and came to see you first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was like this.\u201d Bai Xuan touched his chin and mused, \u201cI remember that the Japanese team has the pretty good Fujita Rika? What was the outcome of the friendly game?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled slightly. \u201cIt was death racing mode and the score was 9:2. The Japanese team was wiped out by us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The stunned Bai Xuan quickly understood. \u201cDid you go out personally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu quietly replied, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cNo wonder. I guess that they probably have a psychological shadow.\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing that the two people hadn\u2019t finished talking, Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t help walking to the bed and stared at Bai Xuan. \u201cYour body isn\u2019t comfortable and you should rest. We will go back to the meeting.\u201d He wanted to drag Li Cangyu away.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong also followed Ling Xuefeng\u2019s cue with a smile. \u201cI will take care of Vice-Captain Bai. You go ahead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu stood up and shook Bai Xuan\u2019s hand. \u201cHave a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he turned and walked away with Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan relaxed. He always felt that while Cat God was present, a certain someone\u2019s eyes were staring a hole in him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

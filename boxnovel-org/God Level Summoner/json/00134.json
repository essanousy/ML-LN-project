Ling Xuefeng went to the front desk to book another room, intending to stay for the time.</p><br/><p>He suddenly came to Guangzhou to see Li Cangyu due to a temporary decision and he hadn\u2019t bought a return ticket. In any case, Li Cangyu\u2019s body still hadn\u2019t recovered. Ling Xuefeng wanted to stay here a few more days before returning to Shanghai.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu saw Ling Xuefeng used his ID card to book a room and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cIf the team is busy, you should go back first. I will recover from this cold in two days. You don\u2019t have to stay with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked back and couldn\u2019t help smiling when he saw Li Cangyu\u2019s serious eyes. \u201cI am staying here not just to accompany you. There are also some things to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wondered, \u201cIs it a private matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a team matter.\u201d Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t intend to hide it and honestly explained, \u201cThere is a live broadcasting platform that wants to ask the Wind Colour team to broadcast some games. I have discussed it with the manager and feel there is no harm in it, so I agreed. The headquarters of the live broadcast company is in Guangzhou. I came here to talk to them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLive broadcasting platform?\u201d Li Cangyu thoughtfully spoke, \u201cA first person live perspective of the arena, isn\u2019t this more like an instructional video?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had seen some broadcasts before. Many experts used the first perspective to teach the audience the operations of certain classes. Novices watching these live videos could learn many things.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s live broadcast platform wanted to invite team players to participate in interactive live broadcasts. Viewers would be attracted by the popularity of the players and the live broadcast platform would gradually expand.</p><br/><p>Many newcomers had poured into Miracle in recent years, especially after news of the World Competition was released. This year\u2019s system changed and the arena rules were more complicated than before. Many newcomers didn\u2019t know how to play. Some e-sports players would use the first perspective explanation videos to teach everyone, which was very good for new players.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu asked, \u201cThe live broadcast platform probably didn\u2019t just find the Wind Colour team, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cTime, Flying Feathers and Ghost Spirits also promised to cooperate with them. On free weekends, players will go to the arena and play casually, making instructional videos for the novices. This is extra income so most players are happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu laughed. \u201cIt seems like Xiao Cheng Wei is the most eager to do this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, Time was the first to sign. Cheng Wei said he would go live and he also preempted the room number 6666.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu whispered, \u201cHe should register 2222.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the distant Beijing, Cheng Wei suddenly sneezed.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled softly and said, \u201cIf there is a chance in the future, open a side account to accompany me in the live broadcast room. I will go there one a fortnight and winning or losing doesn\u2019t matter. Thus, it is a relaxing event.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I go, won\u2019t I be recognized?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied, \u201cJust don\u2019t talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu made an \u2018OK\u2019 gesture. It was great to be able to accompany his boyfriend in the arena and relax after a match. But\u2026 Li Cangyu demanded, \u201cI need an appearance fee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng offered, \u201cI will make you pickled fish if you appear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu held out his hand with a satisfied expression. \u201cDeal!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng gently shook his hand and turned back to the front desk to check-in.</p><br/><p>At this time, the Canglan team members returned from their meal.</p><br/><p>They saw Li Cangyu in the hall and the four teenagers immediately ran to him. Xiao Gu excitedly hugged Li Cangyu and cried out, \u201cCat God, we won! 14:2 is so cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhuo Hang smiled and added, \u201cXiao Li and I got four points in the arena. Cat God, do you want to praise me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounded Li Cangyu helplessly stretched out his hand and rubbed their heads, stating, \u201cYou all did very well. This time I can praise you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming smiled happily and Zhuo Hang was also proud. Xiao Han thoughtfully bowed his head while Li Xiaojiang stood quietly next to Li Cangyu, not saying a word.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng came back after checking in and found Li Cangyu surrounded by four teenagers.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s heart suddenly felt a bit upset. Was it necessary for these four little guys to stick to Li Cangyu like candy? In addition, that Xiao Gu. Why wasn\u2019t he letting go of Li Cangyu?</p><br/><p>Gu Siming felt cold eyes on the back of his neck and let go of Cat God. He looked back and his eyes brightened. \u201cEh? Captain Ling is still here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng told him with a blank expression, \u201cI have something to do in Guangzhou and will be staying a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black fan Gu Siming walked up to him. \u201cCan you give me a signature again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng agreed. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw Ling Xuefeng and took the initiative to step forward, politely saying, \u201cCaptain Ling, did you come to Guangzhou on a business trip?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng certainly couldn\u2019t say that he came to take care of a patient. He used the excuse Bai Xuan found for him and nodded. \u201cI had something to do and came here. I heard you were staying in this hotel and dropped by to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan glanced between him and Li Cangyu before smiling. \u201cThat is really a coincidence. Cat God just became sick.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu coughed because of his guilty conscience and said, \u201cDon\u2019t stand in the hall and chat. Let\u2019s go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Everyone took the elevator to the floor where they lived. Li Cangyu suggested, \u201cEveryone is tired from today\u2019s game. We will go back to rest. Tomorrow\u2019s match will still be arranged and commanded by Old Zhang.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was still a bit hoarse but his state of mind was obviously better. The group put down their worries and returned to their rooms to rest.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s room was next to Li Cangyu. He went to the door and ordered, \u201cOnce you go to bed, turn the air conditioner up higher. Don\u2019t make your cold worse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Go back to take a bath and sleep early. I will find you tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them looked at each other with understanding and returned to their rooms.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming was thick-skinned and didn\u2019t realize anything was wrong when he saw them saying goodbye to each other.</p><br/><p>He swiped the door card to enter and asked, \u201cIs your cold really okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu poured a glass a water and took a few gulps before replying, \u201cIt is nothing. My body has always been in an excellent state and this minor cold is nothing. By the way, how did you feel commanding the game today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming bluntly replied, \u201cNot bad. Winning is very cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled. \u201cIt is unlikely that the former Full Moon and FTD team would win so beautifully. The current lineup of Canglan isn\u2019t mature enough but the young ones are progressing quickly. There are also two stable players in Xiao Bai and Ashu. Commanding them is very smooth, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Zhang laughed. \u201cOf course! This is the first time the reactions of my teammates could keep up with my commands. I didn\u2019t need to explain too much and they knew how to do it themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused before adding, \u201cEspecially Ah Shu. I never noticed how strong he is before but after personally commanding today\u2019s match, I discovered that Ah Shu\u2019s strongest advantage is that he can react differently according to different tactics. The speed of his responses is extremely fast and the error rate is low. He always goes where he is needed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t often praise Xie Shurong but he really liked Xie Shurong. Compared with the old players like Bai Xuan and Zhang Jueming, Xie Shurong was younger. However, compared to the four young rookies, Xie Shurong was a senior who had played for many years.</p><br/><p>In the Canglan team, Xie Shurong was a person in the middle. He was younger than Li Cangyu but older than Xiao Han.</p><br/><p>In the past, Xie Shurong became angry and left Flying Feathers to play in the US for several years. He experienced many things staying alone in a foreign country. He might seem like a big boy by the way he often clung to Bai Xuan\u2019s food and refused to wash the dishes. In fact, his mind and state were very stable. He was the most stable player in the team.</p><br/><p>In the critical moment when Li Cangyu was sick, Xie Shurong stood up and steadied things.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the commander of the match but he was the core of it.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu thought this and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cI really appreciate Ah Shu\u2019s style. He is different from his two brothers. His sword is fast but he is more inclusive. He can attack and retreat, as well as match with the newcomers. This is what I like the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming sighed. \u201cYes! Cat God is amazing for being up to bring such a person to the Canglan team!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI happened to meet him in the new district when his contract was about to expire. He was looking for a team to accept him. Perhaps it is fate?\u201d Li Cangyu also felt that he was lucky. He never expected to meet Xie Shurong in the new district and for Xie Shurong to become his teammate. It was difficult to explain such a coincidence as anything other than fate.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu paused before continuing, \u201cOld Zhang, now Canglan has gradually become a regular team. After these matches, the mentality of the four young ones have stabilized. In the next regular matches, I want to give you some opportunities to command. In the first division, the pressure will be huge. There are no disadvantages in having two commanders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming was stunned but quickly understood his meaning. The bold man couldn\u2019t help feeling moved and scratched his head with embarrassment. \u201cCough, my command level might not be as good as you think\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu grinned and patted him on the shoulder. \u201cI believe in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I believe in you.\u2019</p><br/><p>These simple words made Zhang Jueming let go of any worries.</p><br/><p>Cat God believed in him. Why should he hesitate? They were all old players so let\u2019s just fight it out!</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming thought this and immediately nodded. \u201cSince you think I am trustworthy, I will try it. However, I have been away from the league for many years. You have to tell me if my commanding isn\u2019t good!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, in the future we can study tactics together.\u201d</p><br/><p>By training Zhang Jueming as the vice-commander, Li Cangyu\u2019s real goal was to relieve some of the pressure of the most stressful playoffs stage. At that time, he might have to play in the pairs arena and wouldn\u2019t have so much energy from beginning to end. There was Zhang Jueming to help him. Why not have a double insurance?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

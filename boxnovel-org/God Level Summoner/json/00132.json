The surprising thing was that Li Cangyu didn\u2019t play in the team battle.</p><br/><p>Since the appearance of the Canglan team in the second division, Li Cangyu gained many new fans because of his outstanding performance, particularly in the team battles of the first two matches. Many fans were worried after not seeing Cat God in the team battle. Some people asked about him on his Weibo and others filled the comments of the live broadcast.</p><br/><p>For a while, the Internet was full of: [Cat God?] [Why isn\u2019t Cat God here?] [Didn\u2019t Cat God come today?] Ling Xuefeng saw these comments and looked back. \u201cYour popularity is quite high.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied with a calm expression, \u201cHigh popularity isn\u2019t necessarily a good thing. Once I lose, the comments will be very miserable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng also had a deep understanding of this. The current environment was very fickle. Many people vented their negative emotions on the Internet. They were many people with no brains who spewed out dirty words. There was no point competing with them.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu directly disregarded these negative comments.</p><br/><p>It was why he didn\u2019t explain the reason for losing the last match to the reporters. If he stated he was \u2018sick\u2019, the people who cared for him might be considerate but more people would think that he was making up an excuse for losing.</p><br/><p>It was better to say nothing.</p><br/><p>He preferred to prove himself through practical actions, not his mouth.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>On the live broadcast screen, six players of the Canglan team were already sitting in the contestant seats. Li Cangyu had handed command of this match over to Zhang Jueming and the map he selected was Bloody Forest. This map was darker than Demon Forest and the sky was red. It was a typical night map.</p><br/><p>The advantage of the night map was mainly for two players in Canglan, Xiao Han and Li Xiaojiang. Xiao Han was a blood kin assassin and the best at sneak attacking at night. Meanwhile, Li Xiaojiang was a black magician and wore black equipment. It was easy for him to integrate with the surrounding environment in the night map, making it difficult for the opponent to accurately judge his position.</p><br/><p>It was clear that Zhang Jueming chose this map after careful consideration.</p><br/><p>The two commentators found that Canglan was missing a key member today and Chen Weiwei couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cCat God didn\u2019t come to the venue today. I don\u2019t know the reason but look at the Canglan team\u2019s map selection. The commander of the game should be the veteran Zhang Jueming, the white magician with the ID of Juemingzi.</p><br/><p>Shao Yu saidm, \u201cZhang Jueming, I don\u2019t have an impression of this player. I just heard that he is a white magician auxiliary from the first season. After the disbandment of his team, it is unknown where he went. I am looking forward to seeing his performance since his style is relatively rare.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Weiwei nodded in agreement. \u201cThe white magician auxiliary style is rare in the Miracle League. The old captain of Time, Xu Luo created the white magician with strong control and violent output. Later, Cheng Wei who was raised by him also used this style of play. Now all the white magicians in the Miracle League play the output build. There are none who play support.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yu smiled. \u201cI suddenly found that many players in Canglan are taking different routes. For example, Li Xiaojiang plays a slow style for the black magician. It is really different from an average player.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, black and white magic is originally a violent output combination. The result here is that the white magician is an auxiliary and the black magician is a snail. They shouldn\u2019t be compatible.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people said this as the team battle officially began. Both teams refreshed at the same time on the map.</p><br/><p>The Canglan\u2019s team birth point was in the southwest corner of the map. The six people took a few steps forward and divided into three paths according to the arrangement of Zhang Jueming. They split into 2:2:2 respectively, heading to the lower left, upper left and lower right areas.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan and Gu Siming stayed in the southwest area in the lower left corner closest to the birth point. The combination of a meat shield and milk daddy was obviously to defend and resist any pressure. Zhang Jueming didn\u2019t want them to fight and just stabilize their economy.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong and Li Xiaojiang headed to the southeast corner in the lower right. This arrangement allowed Li Xiaojiang to play better. After all, he had cooperated with Xie Shurong once in the arena. Ah Shu had rich experience and can help Xiao Li in the team battle.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming and Xiao Han went together to the northwest wild area in the upper left corner. Xiao Han could easily use his assassination techniques on such a map while Zhang Jueming would personally assist him to gain an advantage in the early stages.</p><br/><p>This type of splitting up was truly the best arrangement at present. Even if Li Cangyu was the commander, he would still choose this method.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the early stages of the team battle, both sides quietly made money by killing mobs. Then a fierce battle broke out in the northwest corner. Xiao Han\u2019s ability to seize opportunities was very strong. In the online game, he was used to stealth attacks and he liked this dimly lit night map. He saw that the opposite side\u2019s archer had lost 10% blood because of the mobs and the skills were on cooldown. Xiao Han immediately seized the opportunity, using stealth to go around and secretly add a Death Mark to the archer.</p><br/><p>The killer\u2019s Death Mark wasn\u2019t able to be detected by the other person, just like people didn\u2019t know when they were targeted by a killer.</p><br/><p>The Death Mark would increase the killer\u2019s output damage to the target in the next 30 seconds. It also gave the teammates a \u2018I want to kill him\u2019 signal.</p><br/><p>Zhang Jueming saw that Xiao Han had placed Death Mark on the opposite side\u2019s archer and immediately used two auxiliary skills, increasing Xiao Han\u2019s attack power while decreasing the opponent\u2019s defense. Xiao Han decisively used Backstab and Arc Stab to lower the person\u2019s blood to 50%.</p><br/><p>The other side reacted and immediately tried to return fire. However, Xiao Han\u2019s ability to respond was extremely fast and he used combat stealth to disappear into the night.</p><br/><p>Once he reappeared again, he changed the direction of attack. The dagger in his hand emitted a fierce light as he slashed at the opponent\u2019s back. It was the most aggressive attack of the blood kin killer, Whirlwind Stab. Fatal Blow!</p><br/><p>The dagger in his hand was like a spinning blade that mercilessly cut at the other side\u2019s body. It forced the opponent\u2019s blood to below 20% and then he used Fatal Blow to kill the opponent!</p><br/><p>[Frost Descends has killed Boundless Horizon, first kill!]</p><br/><p>This news made all the Canglan team members stunned. Then the southeast corner also sent good news.</p><br/><p>[Snail Crawling Slowly has killed Xijiang Moonlight!]</p><br/><p>It was the second kill and the killers were the young players of the Canglan team. This made the viewers amazed.</p><br/><p>The commentator Shao Yu quickly said, \u201cLi Xiaojiang also took a human head. Let\u2019s take a look at the replay in the southeast wild area!\u201d</p><br/><p>The screen replayed the situation in the lower right corner. Everyone found that the moment the two sides met in the right corner, the berserker Xijiang Moonlight wanted to chase after Li Xiaojiang and ended up being hit by Xie Shurong. The berserker only had a bit of blood left when Ah Shu suddenly stopped and let Li Xiaojiang win the head.</p><br/><p>Chen Weiwei couldn\u2019t help wondering, \u201cAh Shu deliberately gave him the head?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shao Yu nodded. \u201cHe obviously gave the head away on purpose. Otherwise he could\u2019ve killed the player with a simple attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Weiwei said, \u201cHe probably did this to encourage the snail boy fighting in his first team battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Weiwei particularly liked Li Xiaojiang and gave him the nickname of snail boy.</p><br/><p>Shao Yu couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cCat God didn\u2019t come today but the Canglan team fortunately didn\u2019t collapse. The three old players brought a new person and took care of the newcomers. It is good and shows that Canglan must be united.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Weiwei nodded in agreement. \u201cThis is actually very difficult. After all, Cat God didn\u2019t come. If it was another team and their captain was absent, it is likely they would become unstable and their playing would be a mess. Yet today, the Canglan team seems to be telling people that they won\u2019t be bullied even if Cat God isn\u2019t present!\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Xiao Han and Li Xiaojiang had both taken a head, giving the Canglan team a huge advantage. The personal economy of Xiao Li alone exceeded the opponent. Not to mention, Bai Xuan and Gu Siming had stably killed the mobs, making them money. Then Xiao Han and Li Xiaojiang returned and directly bought an attack necklace!</p><br/><p>Xiao Han and Li Xiaojiang had a 5% attack buff from killing one person each plus there was the attack necklace. The two young boys played an important role in the ice dragon battle.</p><br/><p>In particular, Li Xiaojiang was well protected by everyone as he stood in the distance. Thanks to the attack bonus, once he cast a black magic spell\u2026 he directly reduced the opponent\u2019s blood to 50%!</p><br/><p>The terrible attack was too scary!</p><br/><p>Shao Yu couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cLi Xiaojiang has a really distinctive character. He might be slow but as long as his move hits, it will make people feel very painful! Discarding speed and focusing on attack, this was actually quite scary when cooperating well with teammates!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Weiwei said, \u201cYes, now the opposite side is collectively in residual blood. The other Canglan members can complete the harvest!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words had just ended when Ah Shu flexibly cut into the front row of the other party, disabling all three people in the front row. Then he allowed Xiao Han and Li Xiaojiang to collect the heads of those in residual blood. The formation of the other team collapsed and the Canglan team successfully won the ice dragon, increasing their economy!</p><br/><p>The advantage of this slowly accumulated and the battle reached a critical moment.</p><br/><p>In order to prevent an incident where the other team reversed the situation, Zhang Jueming made the wise decision to directly give up on the fire dragon.</p><br/><p>Now the six people\u2019s attack power was high enough to push through to the crystal. There was no need to be greedy over the fire dragon\u2019s attack bonus. If the other team managed to take it, the advantages gained in the early stages would be lost.</p><br/><p>The Canglan team gave up on the fire dragon and pushed directly past the towers in the middle and quickly destroyed the central crystal!</p><br/><p>[Victory!]</p><br/><p>Once the golden word popped up on the screen, Zhang Jueming\u2019s eyes felt hot.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t tell his teammates that this was his first team victory in his career. It was the first time since becoming a professional player that he commanded a team battle and won!</p><br/><p>At this moment, he really thanked Cat God for his trust and giving him the opportunity to command the team.</p><br/><p>He was very grateful to his teammates for their cooperation.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the captain or vice-captain of the Canglan team. He was the oldest player in the league and an invisible auxiliary that the youngsters carelessly called Uncle Zhang.</p><br/><p>However, the four young teenagers didn\u2019t disobey his command. Bai Xuan and Xie Shurong also tried to cooperate with him. At this critical moment when Cat God was sick, the won the team battle under Zhang Jueming\u2019s command!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In the simple training room of the FTD team, he would study Miracle tactics with his few good friends. Every day, he was full of confidence and enthusiasm. They often lost the games but he was able to fight side by side with his good brothers, making every day happy\u2026</p><br/><p>Later, he dreamt of his father\u2019s words before his father went abroad. \u201cI will give you three years to go crazy. If you don\u2019t achieve anything in three years, go to New York with me and immediately find a job!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had smiled and hugged his father. \u201cI know, I will get you the championship trophy in three years.\u201d</p><br/><p>From his father\u2019s point of view, he really was crazy. He didn\u2019t go to an excellent medical school and decided to be an e-sports player. His father couldn\u2019t understand it at all, but he was also reluctant to go against his son directly. Therefore, he gave his son three years.</p><br/><p>However, the three-year time limit passed, and Li Cangyu continued to act crazy for another three years. He failed to fulfil his promise to his father. As a son, he let his father\u2019s heart break and this was his biggest failure.</p><br/><p>There were many scenes of the past. The FTD team being established and disbanded, the Canglan team being established\u2026</p><br/><p>He had walked through the storm for so many years. If he didn\u2019t have a firm heart then perhaps he would\u2019ve given up a long time ago.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu still frowned after falling asleep. Ling Xuefeng inwardly sighed as he adjusted his posture. He took off his coat to cover Li Cangyu and then placed Li Cangyu\u2019s head on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu probably felt that there was a pillow and naturally leaned over.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng reached out and gently hugged his shoulder, taking Li Cangyu into his arms to help him sleep more comfortably.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t sleep well. After a few hours, he was suddenly awakened by a dream of the car accident.</p><br/><p>He looked up and found that the sky was just becoming bright. It was dawn, and the hospital was so quiet that he could even hear a clear heartbeat. He looked back and found that he had been using Ling Xuefeng\u2019s shoulder as a body. He had actually been using this person as his human pillow\u2026</p><br/><p>The embarrassed Li Cangyu sat up and asked, \u201cHow did I fall asleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng looked at him gently and lowered his voice. \u201cYou must be too tired. Do you want to sleep a bit longer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Li Cangyu looked up and rubbed his sore neck. He saw that the ICU doors hadn\u2019t opened yet, so he had to sit back down, looking wearily at his watch.</p><br/><p>It was 6 in the morning and the doctors weren\u2019t at work yet. He didn\u2019t know what happened to his father in the ICU. He was distressed, but he could only wait here for the doctor to inform him of the situation as if he was waiting for a judge\u2019s verdict.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng stood up and said, \u201cThe sky is almost bright. I will go and buy some breakfast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not hungry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can you not eat? Did you even eat dinner last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu\u2019s silence showed that Ling Xuefeng had guessed correctly. His father was still being treated at dinnertime yesterday so how could he be in the mood to eat?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to eat something.\u201d Ling Xuefeng gently pressed a hand to Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cWait here, I\u2019ll go buy it for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng came back after buying breakfast and saw Li Cangyu tiredly leaning on the wall in a daze. Ling Xuefeng sat down beside him, put hot milk and bread into his hand and said softly, \u201cEat something and fill your stomach.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu ate the breakfast. The warm milk warmed his stomach, making his body slightly warmer. At this time, he discovered that he was wearing Ling Xuefeng\u2019s coat and returned it to him. \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng took the clothing and looked back at Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Every time they looked at each other, Li Cangyu\u2019s eyes were clear, bright and filled with confidence. But this time, his eyes were bloodshot and his voice very hoarse. His state was terrible.</p><br/><p>This must be the most upsetting moment for Li Cangyu in recent years.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t dare ask for the specific details of the car accident. He only hoped that Li Cangyu\u2019s father would be fine or else Li Cangyu\u2019s faith would suffer a devastating impact.</p><br/><p>The long night gradually passed and the sky outside the window became brighter. The hour hand finally pointed to 8 o\u2019clock and the door of the ICU opened. The attending doctor came out and asked, \u201cWho is Li Jianan\u2019s family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu immediately stood up. \u201cI am.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was as calm as possible but his fingers were clenched tightly into fists.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng gently touched his hand and then went up to the doctor. \u201cHow is it? Did he wake up?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor nodded. \u201cFortunately, he woke up. The cerebral hemorrhage has stopped and he just needs to recover slowly. Go through the formal procedures and transfer your father to the general ward.\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor thought that Ling Xuefeng was also the patient\u2019s son. LIng Xuefeng didn\u2019t bother explaining as he gently hugged Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder and spoke softly in his ear, \u201cYou go see your father first. I will handle the formal things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded and put on the sterile clothing that the doctor gave him to enter the ICU.</p><br/><p>His father was lying in the hospital bed with open eyes. Li Cangyu walked quickly to his bed and sat down. He whispered, \u201cDad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jianan was silent for a moment before saying, \u201cWhen the car next to me hit\u2026 I thought I was really going to die\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense.\u201d Li Cangyu interrupted him, holding his hand tightly. \u201cWith your stubbornness, you will surely live to be 100 years old.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice sounded very hoarse. He had evidently been waiting outside all night and the dark circles were as serious as a panda.</p><br/><p>Li Jianan saw his son\u2019s tired look and his mouth twitched slightly. He patted his son\u2019s hand and said, \u201cIf I live to 100 years old, you also have to live to over 70. We still have to quarrel as two old men or else it will be boring. I will always get mad at you sooner or later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Cangyu was teased by his father and said, \u201cYou are sick right now. Don\u2019t get too angry. It is easy to get high blood pressure and a heart disease when you are angry. You are a doctor so you should know this better than I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jianan rolled his eyes and asked, \u201cWhere is your sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu said, \u201cI called her yesterday but she didn\u2019t pick up. I sent her a text message\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, a woman in a white coat suddenly appeared through the door. It was Li Cangyu\u2019s sister, Li Yueran.</p><br/><p>She was working in the hospital and couldn\u2019t leave her job. Last night, she happened to have an emergency patient and after the treatment, she was so tired that she went to sleep. She muted her phone and didn\u2019t hear Li Cangyu\u2019s calls.</p><br/><p>As soon as she saw the text message in the morning, Li Yueran rushed over. She came to the bed with an anxious face and asked, \u201cDad, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu didn\u2019t have time to speak when Li Jianan replied, \u201cIt is nothing. There was a traumatic brain hemorrhage caused by a car accident. I just looked at the CT film and the bleeding isn\u2019t in the brainstem and there are no nerves nearby. It can be absorbed slowly after a period of time. The reason I was unconscious last night was due to hypovolemic shock and the doctors have already given me blood.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d The brother and sister looked at each other.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu had a headache as he asked, \u201cDad, can you stop analysing your own condition? Do you think this is a case seminar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jianan said gravely, \u201cI am very clear about my condition. It isn\u2019t serious, so you don\u2019t have to worry too much.\u201d He patted his daughter\u2019s hand and then whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t tell your mother or I\u2019ll be scolded to death by her.\u201d</p><br/><p>The brother and sister, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jianan looked very serious but he was actually a typical hen-pecked husband.</p><br/><p>His mother had always been in charge of the Li family. Li Cangyu clearly remembered a scene he saw when he was a child. His father once provoked his mother and made her angry. The couple were bickering when his mother suddenly took out the tools she used for acupuncture and didn\u2019t say anything. His dad immediately bowed his head and admitted he was wrong.</p><br/><p>When Li Cangyu went to play the game, his father strongly opposed it but his mother was more open-minded as she said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m not obliged to raise you after you are 18 years old. You can make your own decisions in life. However, later don\u2019t run in front of me crying and say that you regret it. Then I will look down on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, Li Cangyu\u2019s personality was a perfect fusion of his parent\u2019s genes.</p><br/><p>The brother and sister looked at each other before Li Yueran smiled and said, \u201cI know, I won\u2019t tell Mother. Mother is still in China and can\u2019t control you from so far away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jianan felt relieved and looked at his daughter. \u201cYou are busy so you can go. I don\u2019t need you here to take care of me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yueran didn\u2019t know if she should laugh or cry. \u201cCome on Dad. I have already taken the day off so let me stay here to accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just then, the doctor came over to inform them about the change to the general ward. The brother and sister pushed their father\u2019s bed to the designated ward. As soon as they entered the room, they saw a handsome man leaning over to make the bed. He heard the movements at the door and looked up. He met Li Cangyu\u2019s eye s and walked over, saying, \u201cThe formalities are completed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu made the introductions. \u201cThis is my father and my sister.\u201d Then he turned to his father and said, \u201cThis is Ling Xuefeng, my best friend. He stayed with me last night and waited until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Jianan nodded at the young man in front of him and said, \u201cI troubled you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied, \u201cUncle doesn\u2019t have to be so polite. I\u2019m glad that you are okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yueran laughed. She carefully looked at Ling Xuefeng and found that this man was really handsome and gracious. It was rare for her brother to have such a reliable friend and she couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cI heard my brother mention you before. You are\u2026 the captain of Wind Colour right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ling Xuefeng nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI muted my phone and didn\u2019t receive any calls yesterday. I bothered you this time, making you wait outside all night. Then\u2026\u201d Li Yueran looked back at her younger brother. \u201cGo back with your friend and sleep. I will stay here and take care of things. I work in this hospital so you can rest assured about Dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to stay here.\u201d Li Cangyu declared.</p><br/><p>Li Jianan glanced at him. \u201cWhy do you have to accompany me. Go to sleep. Do you know what your face looks like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Li Cangyu had no choice but to smile and say, \u201cThen I will go back and eat. I will see you at noon.\u201d</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu and Ling Xuefeng walked through the hospital corridors together.</p><br/><p>The golden morning sunlight shone through the windows in the corridor onto Ling Xuefeng\u2019s handsome face. This always indifferent man suddenly seemed a lot milder when his whole face was bathed in the sun.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu looked at him and didn\u2019t know what to say. Thank you was too common but he really wanted to thank Ling Xuefeng for coming to the hospital and spending this longest and hardest night with him.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Li Cangyu finally asked, \u201cBy the way, when are you flying home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn a flight this evening.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was startled and said, \u201cThen go back to the hotel and sleep. You didn\u2019t get much sleep last night, so you have to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng stopped and stared at Li Cangyu. \u201cYou also have to go back and get a good rest. Your father is out of danger so don\u2019t worry too much.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Last night was an alarm bell. Li Cangyu was thankful to God that his father woke up and decided that he had to spend more time with his father.</p><br/><p>The two people got a car at the entrance of the hospital. Ling Xuefeng asked the driver to take Li Cangyu back first before returning to the hotel.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>His teammates had just woken up when Li Cangyu returned to his residence.</p><br/><p>Yesterday afternoon, Li Cangyu suddenly left after receiving a call. Bai Xuan didn\u2019t know what was going on until the end of the Carnival when Bai Xuan called. It was only then that he knew Li Cangyu\u2019s father was in the emergency room.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan wanted to go to the hospital but he later received a call from Ling Xuefeng. He knew that Ling Xuefeng would rush over and decided not to go. He felt that if this man was by Cat God\u2019s side, his presence wasn\u2019t necessary. He would cook food at home and wait for Li Cangyu to come back.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw Li Cangyu\u2019s tired face and asked worriedly, \u201cIs your father okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s fine. He woke up this morning and has been transferred to the general ward.\u201d Li Cangyu explained.</p><br/><p>Xiao Gu, Uncle Zhang and Xiao Han heard this and were relieved.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled slightly and said, \u201cI might not be able to take care of you for the next few days. Let Bai Xuan take you around and then go back. I will return in December and join you at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Siming immediately exclaimed, \u201cCaptain, you go to accompany your father. We have nothing we want to visit. I will take the day to tidy my luggage and fly back tomorrow morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han said, \u201cMaster, my ticket is for this afternoon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu patted his apprentice\u2019s head and said, \u201cWhen you go back, find a chance to talk to your father about the game. You can show him the Carnival videos. If he doesn\u2019t agree, tell me and I will personally take a trip to your house to explain it to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Han nodded earnestly. \u201cYes, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw the bloodshot eyes and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about this. First, go to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Li Cangyu took two steps when he thought of something and turned back. \u201cBy the way, the doctor said that my father can eat light and easily digestible things. Can you help cook him some porridge and I will take it to him in the afternoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan smiled gently and Li Cangyu\u2019s heart gradually calmed down at the sight.</p><br/><p>He had been emotional after the disbandment of Canglan, but fortunately, he still had Bai Xuan and also these newly recognised teammates. He wasn\u2019t alone in his efforts.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu returned to his room and lay on the bed, soon falling asleep because he was too tired.</p><br/><p>The strange thing was that he suddenly dreamt of Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>In the hospital in the middle of the night, under the dazzling lights, he and Ling Xuefeng were tightly snuggled together. He had fallen asleep on Ling Xuefeng\u2019s shoulder and looked so warm and natural.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

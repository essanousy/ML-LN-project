Every night, he would be intimate with Ling Xuefeng and then fall asleep when exhausted. Once he woke up in the morning, there was a nutritious breakfast waiting for him. At noon, there was the fish that Ling Xuefeng cooked. They were steamed, braised, sweet and sour and all types of other recipes that made him full. In the afternoon, he would go to the beach with Ling Xuefeng to enjoy the sun and listen to music\u2026</p><br/><p>These days were so happy that Li Cangyu was reluctant to leave.</p><br/><p>However, the holiday period would soon be ending and they had to return home to start preparing for the new season.</p><br/><p>That night, Ling Xuefeng was packing up when he got a text message. [Captain Ling, are you in the Maldives? Will you be flying home tomorrow?] The sender was the vice-captain of the Wind Colour team, Yan Ruiwen.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng replied doubtfully: [How do you know?]</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen: [Weibo exposed a photo of you on holiday with Cat God in the Maldives. The fans are going crazy and many journalists are sniffing around the airport. If it is convenient then I suggest you change things around.]</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng opened Weibo and sure enough, a photo was being crazily spread on the home page.</p><br/><p>The photo contained newlyweds. The man was wearing a light blue suit and the woman wore a dress in the same colour. They were a prefect match but the thing that stole attention was the two men not far fro them. One was sitting up with a soft smile on his handsome face while the other was lying down, head naturally resting on the other person. His eyes were closed with a lazy expression.</p><br/><p>It was a photo of Ling Xuefeng and Li Cangyu basking in the sun on the beach.</p><br/><p>The original owner posted this as a wedding photo on Weibo. He didn\u2019t expect that he inadvertently photographed two great gods of the e-sports circle. In one day, the photo was forwarded tens of thousands of times, scaring the original owner into deleting it.</p><br/><p>However, the photo had been saved by the reporters of the major e-sports websites. The news of Ling Xuefeng and Li Cangyu\u2019s holiday in the Maldives swept through the Miracle League and shocked countless people.</p><br/><p>Both of them were high-ranking veterans in the Miracle League. The active professional players in the Miracle League weren\u2019t willing to forward the post in this unclear situation but many people say it and silently paid attention. Yan Ruiwen was among them. He noticed the situation was getting out of control and immediately sent a text message to Ling Xuefeng.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng pointed to the photo on Weibo and asked Li Cangyu, \u201cWhat are your thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu carefully examined the two people who served at the backdrop of the photo and smiled. \u201dThe photo is good and the scenery is beautiful. The people are very handsome.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was open to it and didn\u2019t seem worried about exposure.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng smiled slightly. \u201cAren\u2019t you worried about our relationship being exposed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu replied honestly, \u201cWhat is there to be worried about? I already told you that I would give you a name. This is just earlier than I thought.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to admit it directly?\u201d Ling Xuefeng was a bit surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, otherwise the reporters will catch the wind and speculate indiscriminately.\u201d Li Cangyu paused, holding Ling Xuefeng\u2019s hand as he spoke seriously, \u201cXuefeng, I never had the chance to ask you. This season, we won the World Competition. What are your plans for the next season? Will you continue to lead the WInd Colour team?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Ling Xuefeng asked, \u201cWill you continue playing with Canglan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu smiled and suggested, \u201cWe don\u2019t we write our thoughts on our phones and see if we have a connection?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood.\u201d</p><br/><p>The pair picked up their phones and sent a message to each other\u2019s WeChat.</p><br/><p>There was a prompt about the message arriving and when they opened it, there was one word.</p><br/><p>-Retirement.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Li Cangyu let go of the worries of his heart. He also felt warmth towards Ling Xuefeng who knew him best.</p><br/><p>He joined the Miracle league at the age of 18 and became an e-sports player. He tasted the heartache of his team disbanding, the frustrations of trying to reach the playoffs, the hardships of reorganization and ultimately, becoming the world champion.</p><br/><p>For him, his career had come to a successful conclusion.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he wasn\u2019t young. His dream had been realized and he no longer felt regrets about his favourite e-sports. Retiring at this time was obviously the best choice.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng had also been in the Miracle League for seven years, leading the Wind Colour team to become a first-tier giant. In addition, he gained his cherished person and now was the time to abdicate.</p><br/><p>The two people glanced at each other and tacitly smiled.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu opened his mouth, \u201cMy idea is don\u2019t worry about retiring immediately. Wait until half of the next season has passed and the team\u2019s successors are selected. Once the two teams are stable, we will leave. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s best.\u201d Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cWhat are you going to say to Canglan? The team has just been set up and now the captain is leaving. The players might psychologically find it hard to accept. In addition, there are so many youngsters. Are you willing to leave them alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have probably already guessed the result.\u201d Li Cangyu sighed. \u201cI have limited energy and I\u2019m actually very tired from supporting the team for so many years. Retiring just means I\u2019m not playing the game. I won\u2019t leave the Dragon Song Club and will still guide them in daily training. I think\u2026 they should be able to understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>This approach as quite reasonable. It was like how Song Yang of Flying Feathers acted like a cough while Su Guangmo, Yu Pingsheng and Xie Shurong grew up. Once Flying Feathers won the championship, he was relieved enough to leave.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu naturally couldn\u2019t just drop the Canglan team. Zhuo Hang, Xiao Han, Xiaojiang and Xiao Gu still weren\u2019t capable of being alone. It was necessary for him to stay in the club and help them grow.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a good choice to stay as a coach.\u201d Ling Xuefeng wrapped an arm around Li Cangyu\u2019s shoulder and whispered, \u201cBut if you retired, Xiao Bai won\u2019t continue to play, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t let him continue even if he wanted to.\u201d Li Cangyu frowned with slight distress. \u201cIn the beginning, he had a serious stomach issue and originally wanted to retire. It was due to me that he stayed. Now that we are successful, I want him to have a good rest and recuperate well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You really care about him.\u201d Ling Xuefeng spoke lightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you jealous?\u201d Li Cangyu took Ling Xuefeng\u2019s hand and spoke in his ear. \u201cDon\u2019t think too much. Xiao Bai is a relative while you are my lover.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Ling Xuefeng smiled. \u201cOnce Bai Xuan retires, who will be the captain of Canglan? Is there already a candidate in your heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only give it to Ah Shu first.\u201d Li Cangyu touched his chin for a moment. \u201cXie Shurong is usually not serious but he is very reliable when playing the game. He is young and in his peak state. There is no problem playing for another two or three years. I can feel reassured handing Canglan to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Ling Xuefeng paused before adding, \u201cI hope that Liu Chuan can pick some good seedlings from the training camp. You retiring with Bai Xuan will deal too much damage to the overall lineup. You have to replenish your reserve force as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, a team always has to go through this and I think Liu Chuan is also ready for it.\u201d Li Cangyu smiled and continued, \u201cHe has always been looking at the long-term. When he signed the contract with me, it was only for one year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only signed for a year?\u201d Ling Xuefeng was a bit surprised.</p><br/><p>This showed that Li Cangyu was only ready to play for a year. If he didn\u2019t win the championship then he could only retire with regret.</p><br/><p>He gave himself one last chance and fortunately, he grasped the opportunity.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng saw his bright eyes and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cIt seems that you have long planned everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the only variable is you.\u201d Li Cangyu laughed. \u201cMy plan didn\u2019t include turning Ling Xuefeng into my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was used to calling out \u2018wife\u2019 and Ling Xuefeng indulged him without correcting it. He asked, \u201cYou came back to play the game, only to end up with me. Was it unexpected?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it was very unexpected.\u201d Li Cangyu nodded. \u201cHowever, it is an unexpected joy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people smiled as warm happiness surged in their hearts.</p><br/><p>It was a real unexpected joy to be with this person.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

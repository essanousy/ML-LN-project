It was the place where the angels worshipped the God of Light. The ice-blue buildings soared into the clouds and the entire temple was large enough to accommodate thousands of people. It looked very magnificent.</p><br/><p>The Frost Temple in the match was scaled down and all the angel guards removed. It was completely empty with a red, blue and white crystal refreshing in three adjoining rooms.</p><br/><p>Crystals close to each other were the most difficult to play. Tan Shitian selecting this map showed that he was confident in the Time team\u2019s abilities in a group battle.</p><br/><p>The referee pressed the indicator light and the team battle officially began!</p><br/><p>If the Frost Temple map was regarded as a clock, then the 12 o\u2019clock position was the Wind Colour team\u2019s birth point. The 1 o\u2019clock position was the red crystal refresh point, the 2 o\u2019clock position was the white crystal refresh point, the 3 o\u2019clock position was the blue crystal refresh point and the 4 o\u2019clock position was the Time team\u2019s birth point. In other words, the five positions were exactly fan-shaped and the three crystals were sandwiched between the birth points of both sides.</p><br/><p>In the Miracle Professional League, the rule was that the red and blue crystals refreshed at the same time 30 seconds after the game started. Once the blue and red crystals were taken away, the white crystal would refresh in the form of the last boss.</p><br/><p>It was easier to compete for the red and blue crystals since the players who attacked it would only lose blood or blue. The white crystal was more troublesome. It would give random negative states to the people who attacked it, such as weakness, fear, confusion etc.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At the beginning of the game, the Wind Colour was led by Captain Ling Xuefeng to wait behind a huge pillar at the 2 o\u2019clock position. Ling Xuefeng\u2019s idea was very clear. The Wind Colour team lost the arena match and were currently at a 0:3 disadvantage. They must win the team battle to get points.</p><br/><p>If Tan Shitian went to the nearest room to take the blue crystal, they would definitely pass the fork in the process of transporting the crystal home. Ling Xuefeng set up an early ambush him in order to intercept the crystal in the middle.</p><br/><p>Yes, in Miracle, the crystal needed to be moved back to the birth point in order to receive the points. It could be intercepted in the middle and all the previous efforts lost, just like the bounty mission.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian\u2019s idea was very simple. In a 3:0 dominant situation, he wouldn\u2019t lose in scores as long as he won the blue crystal. Therefore, he took the Time team to the refresh point of the blue crystal at 3 o\u2019clock.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing had the perspective of a god and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cWind Colour\u2019s ambush point is just outside Time\u2019s field of view. It seems a group battle will be inevitable later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this map, if Wind Colour takes the red crystal and Time takes the blue crystal, both sides can peacefully gain two points.\u201d Kou Hongyi paused. \u201cCaptain Ling\u2019s actions\u2026 does he want to take all six points?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is this possibility.\u201d Yu Bing calmly explained. \u201cCaptain Ling\u2019s style has always been more offensive than defensive. He might currently have the inferior score but he won\u2019t play too conservatively. After all, it is the first round of the regular season. Even if he loses, the impact won\u2019t be too big.\u201d</p><br/><p>Six points, this was actually very difficult to gain in a group battle.</p><br/><p>In the Miracle League, most games consisted of each team winning a red and blue crystal. Then they would compete fiercely for the final white crystal. In order to take three crystals in one go, a careful tactical arrangement was needed as well as some luck.</p><br/><p>Wind Colour was lucky today and their ambush location wasn\u2019t discovered by Tan Shitian.</p><br/><p>The members of the Time team peacefully attacked the blue crystal.</p><br/><p>The Time members moved quickly. Everyone let out a burst of hand speed and the blue crystal was empty of blood in less than one minute. The blue crystal changed to a \u2018transportable\u2019 state and a beautiful white freight car appeared in front of everyone. The blue crystal shone beautifully as it was loaded on it. They just needed to click on the car and then transport it back to the spring at their birth point.</p><br/><p>The Time team was escorting the blue crystal out the door when a large group of crows appeared, making everyone stunned!</p><br/><p>\u201cCaptain Ling is very decisive!\u201d Kou Hongyi called out excitedly. \u201cThe sky is covered up. This is the demon summoner\u2019s big move, Summon Black Crows. The flying pets cause large-scale interference, causing the Time team to collectively lose their vision!\u201d</p><br/><p>The skill of the demon summoner\u2019s black crows, \u2018Cover the Sky\u2019 was the skill that annoyed Li Cangyu the most.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t help revealing a disgusted expression when he saw this. \u201cA group of black crows filling the computer screen easily makes people feel queasy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan also smiled. \u201cPlayers in the league are afraid of Captain Ling and don\u2019t dare say it, but the demon summoner\u2019s black crows are really annoying.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Xie Shurong immediately nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>Gu Siming cried out excitedly, \u201cThe black crows are so handsome! Captain Ling is so cool!\u201d</p><br/><p>A fanboy was really a terrible creature, Bai Xuan couldn\u2019t help thinking.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The Time team was currently silent. The black crows didn\u2019t have a high attack power but they were annoying since they would obscure the field of view. The skill Cover the Sky caused a large amount of demon crows to fly over, filling everyone\u2019s eyes with black.</p><br/><p>The even more annoying thing about the Wind Colour team wasn\u2019t the demon summoner\u2019s black crows but the blood kin\u2019s blood bats.</p><br/><p>After Ling Xuefeng\u2019s big control move, the Wind Colour member Xu Feifan followed up with an aggressive attack. \u201cBlood Bat Festival!\u201d</p><br/><p>A large number of blood-sucking bats flew in the sky. It was a big group attack and the Time team\u2019s blood collectively fell.</p><br/><p>The negative states given by the vampire bats were terrible. If the healer couldn\u2019t keep up, the situation could become quite dangerous.</p><br/><p>The Time team\u2019s healer wanted to use a healing array when Ling Xuefeng suddenly summoned the demon pet, a banshee. The banshee\u2019s Charm was used and directly pulled the healer over!</p><br/><p>Charm, this was a spell from the demon banshee that could force the target to come over to her.</p><br/><p>Once the opponent was successfully led to his side, Ling Xuefeng exchanged pets for the Skeleton Infantry, used Death Imprisonment and completely sealed the enemy within the encirclement of the Wind Colour team.</p><br/><p>The other players in Wind Colour weren\u2019t fools. Once the captain forcibly brought the healer over, everyone tacitly attacked the healer. All four outputs focused on the healer and if there were no accidents, the healer would soon be killed.</p><br/><p>Yu Bing saw this and couldn\u2019t help sighing. \u201cCaptain Ling is really fast and ruthless! Calling the crows to control the field of view, calling the banshee to take away the healer and then changing to the skeleton infantry to seal the retreat of the healer\u2026 In just five seconds, he changed between three types of pets and completed three precise operations. This hand speed is truly one of the best in the league. Only\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing\u2019s voice suddenly stopped.</p><br/><p>\u2014Only Li Cangyu\u2019s hand speed could fight him.</p><br/><p>It was just that this person had left the Miracle League a long time ago.</p><br/><p>In that year, Ling Xuefeng\u2019s demon summoner used four types of pets, such as the crows, banshee, skeleton infantry and demon to fight against the water, fire, wind and thunder spirits of Li Cangyu\u2019s elf summoner. The fierce attacks and rapidly movements meant that in every team battle between FTD and Wind Colour, a dazzling sight could be seen.</p><br/><p>They were the well-deserved best summoners of the domestic Miracle League!</p><br/><p>At that time, Yu Bing had been the captain of the Red Fox team. Wind Colour had won the championship in the second season while the FTD team didn\u2019t even score in the top four. However, she always felt that Ling Xuefeng\u2019s strongest opponent should be the summoner Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>They were both summoners and knew each other best. Their pet skills were very balanced and their gameplay against each other was the most exciting.</p><br/><p>If the two of them fought in a single arena match, in the domestic Miracle League\u2026 no, it would be a classic battle in the world\u2019s Miracle circles.</p><br/><p>While Yu Bing was slightly distracted, the people on the Wind Colour team had already killed the opponent\u2019s healer in seconds.</p><br/><p>The crows\u2019 vision control was over and Tan Shitian immediately ordered, \u201cRetreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t have the confidence to fight with Wind Colour. However, they were ambushed and the healer had died. There was almost no chance of victory when fighting Wind Colour right now. If the Time team was wiped out, it would be harder to fight later.</p><br/><p>The group followed Captain Tan\u2019s instructions and quickly retreated.</p><br/><p>However, Cheng Wei didn\u2019t seem to hear Tan Shitian\u2019s words and kept attacking. Ling Xuefeng immediately seized this opportunity and used the skeleton infantry\u2019s Death Imprisonment to fix Cheng Wei in place. Xu Feifan immediately had the blood snake bit Cheng Wei and Yan Ruiwen followed with the black magic spell Shadow Plague. Guo Xuan wasn\u2019t willing to lag behind and used Hell Flames to smash Cheng Wei!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the terrible ability of the Wind Colour team!\u201d Kou Hongyi couldn\u2019t help sighing.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng didn\u2019t need to give any commands for the other three outputs of the Wind Colour team to follow his rhythm. This was the tacit understanding created by long-term training between the four players of Wind Colour. The person who the captain controlled would immediately receive everyone\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian got a bad feeling the moment Cheng Wei was killed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Wei\u2019s mood was clearly wrong today. When he started the arena, he was cut to half blood in the opening. Fortunately, Qin Mo was also in a bad state and Tan Shitian personally saved the three points from the arena matches.</p><br/><p>Now Xiao Wei hadn\u2019t been concentrating on his commands and was caught by Captain Ling.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian looked back and found that Cheng Wei\u2019s face seemed unnaturally pale.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian endured the urge to ask him questions and calmly ordered, \u201cGo back to recover our blue and blood at the birth point. Then we will go to take the red crystal.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blue crystal had been intercepted by Wind Colour so they could only wait for an opportunity to seize the red crystal.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei might\u2019ve made a mistake but Ling Xuefeng wouldn\u2019t make any mistakes.</p><br/><p>As the team with the lowest error rate in the league, the Wind Colour team could completely reverse the situation in one breath as long as the chance to counterattack was given!</p><br/><p>In the battle over the red crystal, Ling Xuefeng seized the loophole called Cheng Wei and directly used the banshee to pull Cheng Wei over!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng even killed three power and got a 15% attack bonus.</p><br/><p>After successfully winning the red crystal, in the final white crystal battle, Ling Xuefeng with his attack bonus was like a person who controlled the dead!</p><br/><p>[Undead Demon has killed Only Dedication, fourth kill!</p><br/><p>[Undead Demon has killed Happy, fifth kill!</p><br/><p>[Undead Demon has killed 10 Days, sixth kill!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng was such a cool and scary player.</p><br/><p>On the field, regardless of advantages or disadvantages, as long as the other side was slightly careless, he would use this tiny mistake to make a breakthrough, directly tearing open the opponent\u2019s formation and defeating all their defenses!</p><br/><p>This was only why most people were fans of the Wind Colour team.</p><br/><p>This style of playing the game was enjoyable to watch. Wind Colour might be losing until they turned it around in the last 10 seconds, stimulating the hearts of the people watching.</p><br/><p>Today they showed a wonderful comeback. They might\u2019ve lost three points in the arena but they incredibly got six points in the group battel!</p><br/><p>Yu Bing found it somewhat unbelievable. \u201cThe gap between Time and Wind Colour isn\u2019t big. It is really unexpected for there to be such a big loss in the team battle. However, Captain Ling has played for six seasons and his experience is definitely more abundant than Captain Tan. He has more tactical ideas. Captain Tan\u2019s way of thinking wasn\u2019t wrong. It was just that his team members couldn\u2019t keep up and Captain Ling seized the opportunity\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing saw Cheng Wei\u2019s pale face and held back her words.</p><br/><p>The key point of the team battle\u2019s defeat was Cheng Wei. He couldn\u2019t keep up with Tan Shitian\u2019s rhythm and was caught by Ling Xuefeng two times. In Miracle\u2019s team battles, killing a person would give a 5% attribute bonus. In the case of killing three people, Ling Xuefeng with his 15% attribute bonus definitely wouldn\u2019t be polite to the opponents.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian was quite helpless. In the first round of the blue crystal battle, he had an unpredictable feeling. The strength of both sides were similar so it was normal for Wind Colour to win when a member of Time was off.</p><br/><p>He felt a bit angry but when he saw this little guy\u2019s pale look\u2026 he wasn\u2019t willing to scold Cheng Wei.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian sighed and gently rubbed Cheng Wei\u2019s head. \u201cIt\u2019s okay. It is just a game in the regular season and it isn\u2019t a big deal to lose a few points. We scored three points today so our ranking is in the top three.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Tan Shitian said, the game was 6:3 in favour of Wind Colour. The rankings were updated in real time and Wind Colour was currently first, Flying Feathers was second and Time was ranked third.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian tried to ease the atmosphere but Cheng Wei didn\u2019t seem to buy it as he kept staring at the computer in a daze.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>A moment later, the two captains signed to the referee to confirm the score. Then Ling Xuefeng led the Wind Colour team over to shake hands.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian stood up politely and stretched out his hand. \u201cCaptain Ling, you played well today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng shook hands with him and said, \u201cCaptain Tan is very kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, Ling Xuefeng debuted in the first season while Tan Shitian debuted in the fourth season. He was a new captain who only took over Time in the fifth season so he should show respect for Captain Ling.</p><br/><p>The captains politely shook hands while Vice-Captain Cheng Wei sat there, not talking..</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng headed to Cheng Wei and whispered in a voice only he could hear. \u201cIs it due to the disbandment of Canglan?\u201d</p><br/><p>It might be a question but his tone was already certain.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei suddenly raised his head, a complicated expression in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng gently patted Cheng Wei\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSome people don\u2019t need your help when they fall down. You should believe in his ability. After this setback, he will surely become more powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Cheng Wei was stunned. By the time he recovered, Ling Xuefeng had already turned to leave.</p><br/><p>This man was tall and upright, his spine as straight as a pine.</p><br/><p>He had always been indifferent and decisive, his personality not changing after so many years. He used his own body to prop up the most feared Wind Colour team in the Miracle League. Today there was just a mistake in positioning and he accurately seized the opportunity. In an instant, the Time team collapsed\u2026</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei might\u2019ve lost but he was convinced.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei saw Cat God as a master and his relationship with Cat God was very close. However, he also admired Ling Xuefeng, a player who could match Cat God.</p><br/><p>This man had sharp eyes that could see through other people\u2019s thoughts with one glance.</p><br/><p>Was he just telling Cheng Wei that Li Cangyu would become stronger and there was no need to worry?</p><hr/><br/><p>You can also join my discord channel to chat with fellow readers about the novels;</p><br/>\n</div>"}

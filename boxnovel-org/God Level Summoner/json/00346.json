Tan Shitian bought a weapon that slowed down the opponent by 50% for five seconds when the arrow hit the opponent.</p><br/><p>This weapon with a deceleration effect would allow Tan Shitian to better play his kite flow. In particular, his Death Arrow Rain would cause all enemies in range to be decelerated. He could freely attack in the distance and the opponent could never catch up to him.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen bought a ring and necklace which both increased the crit rate of black magic. The two people replaced their equipment and the entire team\u2019s output capacity improved by one grade.</p><br/><p>In the same way, the US team\u2019s Benjamin and Angus also gained a lot of money and changed their gear. They had a chance to go head on against the Chinese team.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian and Lu Xiao had run out of blue so the ice dragon hadn\u2019t been killed. After seeing that everyone had resurrected, Tan Shitian made a mark on the mini-map and ordered, \u201cKill the ice dragon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group quickly followed him to the refresh point of the ice dragon.</p><br/><p>To Tan Shitian\u2019s surprise, he didn\u2019t see the American team when he arrived at the ice dragon.</p><br/><p>Yan Ruiwen asked doubtfully, \u201cThe US team didn\u2019t come to play the ice dragon? Or are they lying in wait in the area?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian thought for a moment before his expression suddenly changed, \u201cNot good. They might\u2019ve gone to kill the fire dragon!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ice dragon and fire dragon refreshed at fixed times. In past economic wars, they would first kill the ice dragon and then kill some small mobs to gain enough equipment to kill the dragon.</p><br/><p>However, today\u2019s economic war obviously wasn\u2019t quite the same. The first wave of combat was too intense and Tan Shitian and Lu Xiao failed to kill the ice dragon because they ran out of blue. By the time everyone resurrected and rushed over to the ice dragon, the fire dragon had appeared in the upper half of the map.</p><br/><p>At this time, the commander was faced with two choices. Continue to fight the ice dragon and win the economy. If they beat the other side here, it would lay the foundation to win the game. The second way was to risk killing the fire dragon with relatively poor equipment but the fire dragon would give an attack and defense buff.</p><br/><p>The first choice was clearly more secure and was the choice that Tan Shitian had made.</p><br/><p>The second approach was very risky. If it failed, it would be benevolent for the other side!</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian ordered, \u201cKill the ice dragon as soon as possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>The location of the two bosses was very far away and it would be too late if they headed to the fire dragon. They could only kill the ice dragon at the fastest speed before heading to the crystal.</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s bold decision was very unexpected for the two commentators. Kou Hongyi marvelled, \u201cFighting the fire dragon with poor equipment, he has too much courage! But\u2026 the US team has a paladin and this lineup can resist the dragon\u2019s damage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing nodded. \u201cBenjamin\u2019s choice is very adventurous. However, if he doesn\u2019t take the risk to kill the fire dragon and instead headed to the ice dragon, the US team wouldn\u2019t have an advantage because Tan Shitian bought the deceleration weapon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong sat with the rest of the team and couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cBenjamin\u2019s command level is excellent. He clearly saw Tan Shitian\u2019s weapon and took the players to fight the fire dragon. If they win the fire dragon, the later wave of combat will be bad for the Chinese team.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ICE team\u2019s captain was truly worthy of his reputation. Li Cangyu thoughtfully touched his chin. \u201cIn fact, Benjamin\u2019s strength isn\u2019t worse than Jack Josh of the same team? Even so, his popularity isn\u2019t very high.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is because he isn\u2019t as handsome as Jack. The Americans look at the face and Jack\u2019s popularity surpasses him by 10 times.\u201d Xie Shurong explained, \u201cI spent 2.5 years in the ICE team and the core of this team has always been Benjamin. Jack is the most popular and he is hot-tempered, but he is a well-behaved sheep in front of the captain.\u201d</p><br/><p>To be able to make Jack such a popular god, this handsome man must have a real ability. Based on today\u2019s command, he was very decisive and simple in key moments.</p><br/><p>The Chinese team all had ranged, weak defense classes and they couldn\u2019t endure the firepower of the fire dragon. There was a great possibility that Tan Shitian would go to the ice dragon so Benjamin diverted the team to kill the fire dragon. This made Li Cangyu feel admiration for his choice.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The ice dragon didn\u2019t have much attack power and its defense was also relatively weak. The Chinese team took half a minute to kill the ice dragon and received the economic bonus.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian ordered, \u201cGo back to the city and then the fire dragon\u2019s cave!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group immediately returned to the city to replace their equipment. At this time, the fire dragon had 30% blood left.</p><br/><p>The paladin received the damage in the front row while the healer restored blood from the rear. The remaining two swordsmen and berserkers were releasing their highest hand speed to kill the dragon.</p><br/><p>From time to time, the dragon would roar and breathe out fire. This dealt a lot of damage to the players but the paladin\u2019s shield and the priest\u2019s healing meant the blood of the US team remained above 80%.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian and Lu Xiao used Flying Feather Steps to quickly reach the fire dragon\u2019s cave where they saw that the blood of the dragon was rapidly declining.</p><br/><p>The game had reached a critical moment and the viewers stared anxiously at the big screen.</p><br/><p>By the time Tan Shitian and Lu Xiao arrived, the US team\u2019s Benjamin had just stabbed the dragon\u2019s chest and it fell to the ground with a bang.</p><br/><p>The paladin saw that the Chinese team had rushed over and opened Guardian\u2019s Power and Iron Will to protect his teammates from damage and control.</p><br/><p>Benjamin didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cGo to the second floor!\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of the American team followed him to the second floor where there were two guardian beasts on the stairs. Compared to the dragon, the guardian beasts were relatively easy to easy. The US team had two thick-skinned berserkers. They pulled a beast each and the swordsmen attacked to quickly kill the beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis attack power is too terrible!\u201d Kou Hongyi was anxious. The US team has won an attack and defense buff from killing the fire dragon and this is more than the effect of equipment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it usually takes at least 10 seconds to kill the beasts but the US team took only eight seconds.\u201d Yu Bing stared at the big screen and spoke quickly. \u201cThe fire dragon\u2019s buff is only 30 seconds. The Chinese team must survive these 30 seconds and prevent the US team from destroying the crystal!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is hard because the two berserkers of the US team are guarding the stairwell!\u201d Kou Hongyi exclaimed.</p><br/><p>On the screen, the two berserkers of the US team killed the guardian beasts and used their huge bodies to interfere with the Chinese team on the stairs. Winfrey hid behind them and gave them several layers of Healing Language.</p><br/><p>Benjamin and Angus had gained an attack buff and quickly attacked the crystal, not hesitating to pour out all their skills.</p><br/><p>People couldn\u2019t help thinking of the previous game between China and South Korea.</p><br/><p>In the same economic battle, the commander was Ling Xuefeng and he had Qin Mo, Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan stand at the entrance to the highlands to obstruct the Korean team. Bai Xuan was responsible for adding blood while Ling Xuefeng and Xie Shurong released the highest hand speed to attack the crystal.</p><br/><p>By the time the South Korean team broke through the obstruction, they saw the image of the crystal being shattered.</p><br/><p>Now the US team used a similar tactic. The two berserkers were on the stairs and the healer was behind them while the high output swordsmen attacked the crystal with the fastest speed.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian and Lu Xiao were blocked by the paladin. They didn\u2019t pay attention to him and used Flying Feather Steps to circumvent around him. They came to the second floor stairwell only to see the two bersekers of the US team.</p><br/><p>The stairwell was very narrow. If they wanted to pass, they had to kill the two berserkers.</p><br/><p>However, the berserkers had thick skin and high defense. Combined with the defense bonus from the fire dragon, the berserkers were like a bronze wall. Tan Shitian and Lu Xiao fired consecutive Barrage Shots and Seize Life Shots and only knocked out 20% of their blood.</p><br/><p>The hiding Winfrey used a healing chain and the other side\u2019s blood was back to 100%.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian helplessly ordered, \u201cControl them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other players didn\u2019t have the speed of the elf species and only just arrived at the scene. Cheng Wei immediately used the group control Holy Seal and made Winfrey temporarily unable to release blood. This was followed by Shadow Winding, Hell Flames, Tidal Surge and Death Arrow Rain!</p><br/><p>The light effect of various skills shrouded the stairwell and the thick-skinned berserkers were finally suppressed to 30% blood!</p><br/><p>At this time, the seal ended and the paladin came from behind. He used Steel Battle Soul to rebound any damage done to his teammates and Winfrey took the opportunity to cast the healer\u2019s big move, Desperate Prayer!</p><br/><p>A white glow fell from the sky and the blood of the berserkers was restored.</p><br/><p>The audience, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi couldn\u2019t help spitting out, \u201cThe berserkers and paladin are too thick-skinned. In addition, there is the defense bonus after killing the boss. We simply can\u2019t kill them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu Bing frowned. \u201cThe 30 second bonus is ending soon but the crystal doesn\u2019t have much blood left\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The camera cut to the crystal and the crystal only had 15% blood left.</p><br/><p>At this time, the bonus of the fire dragon finally ended. Cheng Wei used the single control skill on Winfrey and the Chinese team opened all types of big moves to hit the four US players blocking the road. The two berserkers finally fell to residual blood.</p><br/><p>Winfrey\u2019s sealing effect was ending and Yang Muzi immediately placed a seal on her so she couldn\u2019t add blood. Yan Ruiwen and Guo Xuan placed five layers of Death Curse while Tan Shitian and Lu Xiao fired their arrows to finally kill a residual blood berserker!</p><br/><p>The Chinese team quickly killed the other berserker but by the time Tan Shitian and Lu Xiao used Flying Feather Steps to move to the crystal, there was only 5% blood left on the crystal.</p><br/><p>Benjamin and Angus both opened up Light and Shadow Rotation and a dazzling white light surrounded the crystal. Every ray of light directly smashed the middle of the crystal.</p><br/><p>The release of the swordsman\u2019s big move caused the sound of the crystal breaking to enter their ears.</p><br/><p>\u2014Winner!</p><br/><p>The US team took the victory in a thrilling manner.</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian helplessly removed his hands from the keyboard.</p><br/><p>It was only a few seconds of blocking the other side but the game was too exciting. No one could tell what would happen until the last moment.</p><br/><p>In this game, the Chinese team had the advantage in the early stages and were dominant with the economy. However, the US team\u2019s killing of the fire dragon at a critical moment was perfect.</p><br/><p>In a battle between the strong, there were always winners and losers. He was used to losing but once the grey screen appeared, Tan Shitian couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s expression was very depressed but he quickly adjusted. He gently patted Tan Shitian on the hand and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be sad. This isn\u2019t your fault. No one couldn\u2019t expected that to happen. We did the best we could.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Shitian saw his earnest eyes and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cHave you also learnt to comfort people?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei scratched his head and whispered, \u201cCat God said to truly be strong psychologically, the first step is to calmly face failure.\u201d He paused and looked at Tan Shitian, asking seriously, \u201cAfter this loss, my mood is actually calmer than the semi-finals. Is my psychological quality much better than before?\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy\u2019s clumsy way of comforting caused Tan Shitian\u2019s heart to soften. He gently held Cheng Wei\u2019s hand and said, \u201cWe have done our best and have a clear conscience. Next, we will give it to Cat God.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheng Wei\u2019s fists clenched and there was a hint of firmness in his eyes. \u201cYes! Cat God will surely win!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

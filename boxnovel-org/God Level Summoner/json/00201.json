Canglan was much stronger in the arena than in team battles. This match determined if Canglan could enter the playoffs or not and Li Cangyu couldn\u2019t be sloppy.</p><br/><p>Even if a player made a mistake, the ones behind them could find a way to slowly recover from the disadvantages. Once defeated in a team battle, it would be extremely difficult to grab the situation from Tan Shitian\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>The fans understood Li Cangyu\u2019s choice and Tan Shitian had also long guessed it.</p><br/><p>Next up was the map. Li Cangyu chose a map that didn\u2019t often appear\u2014Elf\u2019s Covenant.</p><br/><p>This was a secret place in the elf realm. It was a dense forest where the trees were silver white and gave off a faint glow. There were many lovely silver spores that flew around the forest like small fireflies.</p><br/><p>This map was characterized as a status acceleration map.</p><br/><p>The Red Fox team had used a cold deceleration map to face Canglan. Now Li Cangyu chose an acceleration map to deal with Time. All members who entered the map would have movement speed increased by 20%.</p><br/><p>This choice surprised many players. Time\u2019s archers were ranged players. If they were accelerated, wouldn\u2019t their skills be more effective?</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi also wondered about this. [I can\u2019t understand Cat God\u2019s thoughts. I feel there is a bit of danger choosing the acceleration map for the arena\u2026]</p><br/><p>Yu Bing was aware of something. She maintained a calm expression as she guessed: [Although the acceleration map has the same effect for both sides but\u2026 for example, let\u2019s say you often wear skates. On an important day, you will be very comfortable moving on roller skates. However, for a person who usually wears leather shoes, suddenly changing to roller skates will certainly affect his speed.]</p><br/><p>Kou Hongyi\u2019s IQ wasn\u2019t as high as Yu Bing and he immediately made a worshipful expression. \u201cSister Bing\u2019s words are right! Canglan must\u2019ve specifically trained during this one week on the acceleration map and will naturally be comfortable. That isn\u2019t necessarily the case for Time. They probably didn\u2019t practice at all on an acceleration map. Even if they practiced, they certainly didn\u2019t specifically study this map. In a tense moment where the fate of the playoffs will be decided, the players might make a mistake if they are uncomfortable and Canglan will grab that chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>The audience listened to their explanations and probably understood Li Cangyu\u2019s meaning.</p><br/><p>The status acceleration map was nothing compared to the difficult kill maps so there was no point in Time practicing it. Canglan had been practicing for a week and would naturally have the advantage.</p><br/><p>It was like Yu Bing said. A person used to wearing leather shoes suddenly changed into roller skates. They would be very fast but it was easy to fall. Li Cangyu was also a person excellent when it came to grasping opportunities. It would be difficult for Time to win when he was the guard.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The first combination that the Time team sent was Liang Sejie and Liang Deyuan, the two elf archers. This was the classic double archers combination of the Time team. They weren\u2019t brothers but their long-term cooperation led to a tacit understanding forming between them. This meant they often appeared in team battles to assist Tan Shitian to output.</p><br/><p>On Canglan\u2019s side, the first to play were Xiao Han and Gu Siming.</p><br/><p>Many viewers didn\u2019t understand this arrangement. This changed once the game started. What was Gu Siming\u2019s nickname? Little madman! He was very aggressive and active. On the 20% acceleration map, he was simply a mad bull provoked by the Spanish bullring.</p><br/><p>Gu Siming evolved from a little madman into a super madman. He raised shields and chased the two archers. The two archers laughed as they were chased by him, thinking, \u2018You are a thick paladin. How can you catch up with us?\u2019</p><br/><p>Canglan\u2019s fans were also a bit anxious. Xiao Gu starting the quick chase seemed excellent but paladins didn\u2019t have many attack skills. He only had a bunch of protective skills and thick skin. In the face of the two archers\u2019 outputs, could he endure for long?</p><br/><p>As it turned out, Gu Siming was more resistant than everyone thought.</p><br/><p>During this time, Li Cangyu had intensively trained his ability to resist stress. Sometimes the other three teenagers would team up to play Xiao Gu and Xiao Gu was tortured all day long. After a long time, he gained some survival ability.</p><br/><p>The biggest advantage of a paladin was their high defense and they had many protective skills to help their teammates resist damage. In the past, Gu Siming always thought about going forward and breaking open a bloody road to let his teammates output. In fact, many times he should do more protection. Attacking the enemy and opening a gap was the responsibility of the sharp swordsman Xie Shurong!</p><br/><p>After trying to understand this, Gu Siming patiently practiced for a month in accordance with Li Cangyu\u2019s arrangement. In the second round of the regular season, Canglan\u2019s tem battles had been erratic. Everyone thought this young player wasn\u2019t in the right state but it was actually because Gu Siming was seriously looking for a suitable style.</p><br/><p>Today he found it.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Gu Siming lasted for three minutes and still didn\u2019t die. The two players of the Time team couldn\u2019t help feeling anxious. They had already wasted many skills on this paladin and it would be too shameful if they didn\u2019t kill him. There was also Xiao Han hidden in stealth. No traces of him had been found yet.</p><br/><p>Liang Sejie made a blue signal on the map. This was an indication that they should unleash their full attacks.</p><br/><p>The two people tacitly agreed and simultaneously fired their big moves\u2014Seize Life Shot!</p><br/><p>However, a clear ringing sound entered their ears. Everyone saw a golden light appear on the paladin\u2019s body, the light quickly taking the shape of a shield in front of Gu Siming.</p><br/><p>\u2014Furious Light Shield</p><br/><p>The paladin used the anger in their heart to form a light shield, guarding themselves or their teammates and bouncing all the damage back to the other party!</p><br/><p>The effect of this skill was similar to the blood kin sacrifice\u2019s Lava Shield that Xiao Han had been hit by.</p><br/><p>The two Time players were caught off guard and their own big moves immediately decreased their blood by 30%!</p><br/><p>Gu Siming\u2019s light shield shattered immediately after being attacked. The golden fragments flew through the air in a dazzling manner. Many fans excited sent him flowers and the Canglan support group suddenly became lively.</p><br/><p>[Xiao Gu is good! I give you 100 points for your awareness!] [The two members of Time probably want to cry. Their big moves were bounced back to themselves\u2026]</p><br/><p>[This is the consequence of underestimating paladins! Don\u2019t look down on them because they have less attack skills. They can bounce back attacks and kill you!]</p><br/><p>Gu Siming was very excited at this time. He had been suppressed by Zhuo Hang, Xiao Han and Li Xiaojiang some time ago. He already worked out that he should wait patiently regardless of how he was abused.</p><br/><p>He had been waiting and patiently held onto this skill. He saw that his blood was decreasing and didn\u2019t impulsively open the shield. He waited until the two men finished Shock Shot before immediately pressing the key for the light shield.</p><br/><p>During this week, they had repeatedly watched the videos of the Time matches and Cat God summarized the characteristics of some opponents. The double archers had a habit of joining hands when dealing with a person. Once they used Shock Shot, the terrifying Seize Life Shot would come!</p><br/><p>The habits of many professional players were impossible to casually change. Once Gu Siming made a decision, he was very decisive. He actually ended up countering these deadly moves!</p><br/><p>It was at this critical moment that Xiao Han appeared.</p><br/><p>The intelligent teenager was very good at grasping opportunities. The cold light of his bloody daggers starkly contrasted with the silver and white background of the elf area.</p><br/><p>He was like a dark but flexible shadow on the brightly coloured map. He appeared silently behind Liang Sejie and decisively slashed at his neck.</p><br/><p>\u2014Death Mark, Backstab, Soul Stab, Fatal Blow!</p><br/><p>Due to the increase in movement speed, Xiao Han\u2019s actions when attacking were particularly handsome and smooth. Many Xiao Han fans saw it and cried out:</p><br/><p>[The little prince is so handsome!] [Our little prince is powerful!] [He really is like a shadow! So difficult to fight!]</p><br/><p>Liang Sejie of the Time team thought that this young boy\u2019s speed was terrible.</p><br/><p>The last time he faced Xiao Han at the beginning of the seventh season, this body didn\u2019t play well apart from the impressive appearance of blond hair and black eyes. In just a few months, he had been reborn as an assassin!</p><br/><p>Qin Mo watched the game on TV and felt admiration. \u201cXiao Han\u2019s hand speed is very fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng nodded. \u201cIt is also effective hand speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>The difference between pure hand speed and effective hand speed was very high. It definitely wouldn\u2019t work if your hands were fast but you kept missing. Effective hand speed was the speed at which skills were accurately released. It could be seen that under Li Cangyu\u2019s training, Xiao Han had broken through his own bottleneck. He connected his skills together as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>Quietly emerging from the darkness and letting out a burst of hand speed to directly kill the opponent, this was a real assassin!</p><br/><p>Xiao Han was playing at the super level in the accelerated map. Liang Sejie was a relatively good player in the league but the map acceleration and silver white light made his eyes and hand speed somewhat uncomfortable. Xiao Han was like a phantom as he struck from the front and rear\u2026</p><br/><p>[Frost Descends has killed Big and Young Liang!]</p><br/><p>The news that appeared on the big screen caused the audience to clap and Li Cangyu smiled.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the mentality of the young ones had adjusted quite well.</p><br/><p>This game was crucial to the Canglan team but Xiao Gu and Xiao Han weren\u2019t stressed and played well. As Li Cangyu said, they should enjoy it like it was the final match!</p><br/><p>The four teenagers were all proud and didn\u2019t want to end the seventh season\u2019s regular season with too much regrets. They fought with the attitude of \u2018I want to do my best.\u2019</p><br/><p>As long as they played to their own standards, Li Cangyu had the confidence to lead them into the playoffs to compete for the trophy!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

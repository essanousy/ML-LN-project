The restaurant at the Miracle Village offered buffet meals but since most of the chefs were from the United States, there was definitely no Chinese food. The breakfast here were mostly omelettes, milk and bread. The Chinese members mostly ate steak, toast, fruit salad and pastries.</p><br/><p>People who liked to eat sweets like Cheng Wei and Tan Shitian were very happy. As soon as they arrived at the restaurant, they grabbed plates to find things like matcha cake, black forest cake, strawberry cake etc. They ate cake all day and weren\u2019t tired of it. They also didn\u2019t get fat. This made the three sisters of Red Fox feel envious.</p><br/><p>In fact, Tan Shitian didn\u2019t love to eat sweets. He just saw that Cheng Wei loved them and wanted to accompany him to eat.</p><br/><p>Zhang Shaohui really liked steak and loved meat since he was a child. In the Ghost Spirits team, he always had meat. The form might\u2019ve changed once he went abroad but he wouldn\u2019t refuse as long as it was meat. He could eat two big steaks in one meal.</p><br/><p>Others lacked interest in Western food and some frowned and soon as they walked into the restaurant.</p><br/><p>It had been a few days of eating the same food in the Miracle Village and the people not used to it wanted to vomit. However, the World League was relatively strict. During the competition, players weren\u2019t allowed to go out at will. They were unfamiliar with this place and if they received food poisoning from eating something unclean, the league couldn\u2019t afford to bear the responsibility.</p><br/><p>It was a foreign country so the players\u2019 requests couldn\u2019t be too high. They ate enough to fill their stomachs.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Today, the steak in the restaurant was 70% cooked. Xie Shurong brought over to plates and handed one to Bai Xuan. He sat down and complained, \u201cI want to eat your sweet and sour ribs, cola chicken wings, braised eggplant, steamed bass\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He drooled as he mentioned the names of the dishes.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan saw his greedy appearance and couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cEndure it for a few days. Once we return home, I will make them for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, I will be sure to eat your cooking when we go back to the country!\u201d Xie Shurong gave Bai Xuan a plate of fruit salad. \u201cThese fruits are quite fresh. You should eat some more.\u201d Cheng Wei was eating cake with relish next to them. He glanced at Ah Shu and Bai Xuan and asked, \u201cShould I get a few cakes for you to try?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan told him, \u201cI\u2019m not hungry. I will eat anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have an appetite. After finishing his lunch, he headed back to the dormitory with everyone.</p><br/><p>Once they reached the stairs, Li Cangyu told them, \u201cHave a good rest to raise your energy for the afternoon. At three in the afternoon, we will meet in the meeting room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone dispersed and went back to their rooms to have a nap.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong soon fell asleep. In his dream, he was holding a naked Bai Xuan in his arms. Bai Xuan was red-faced and completely didn\u2019t resist. Xie Shurong was quite cheap and couldn\u2019t help smiling slightly.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t wake up from the dream until his alarm clock rang at 2:30.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong sat up in a contented manner and turned his head. He found that Bai Xuan wasn\u2019t in bed. His quilt was quite messy, as if he had just emerged from it.</p><br/><p>The light in the bathroom was on and Xie Shurong walked over doubtfully. He opened and saw Bai Xuan crouching beside the toilet. His face was pale and bloodless as he vomited. This made Xie Shurong\u2019s heart jump up!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Xie Shurong rushed to Bai Xuan\u2019s side. One hand was placed around the waist while the other hand patted Bai Xuan\u2019s back in a worried manner. \u201cDid you eat something bad? Is your stomach uncomfortable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Bai Xuan nodded and forced out a reluctant smile. \u201cIt might be because the steak and fruits were digested after eating. My stomach is a bit uncomfortable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing the pale face that was trying to be relaxed, Xie Shurong felt both distressed and angry, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you wake me up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t call you after seeing that you were sleeping.\u201d Bai Xuan softly explained while holding Xie Shurong\u2019s arm and standing up. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. My stomach disease won\u2019t last more than a day or two. Perhaps it is because I have been eating cold things these days and they haven\u2019t digested. After eating lunch, I wasn\u2019t very comfortable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong lifted him up and whispered, \u201cIs it still uncomfortable? I brought some stomach medicine. I\u2019ll find something for you to take.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he gently stretched out his arms and carried Bai Xuan.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was shocked and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing? Put me down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at how uncomfortable you are. What do you expect me to do?\u201d Xie Shurong gave him a reproachful look. \u201cI am your boyfriend, not someone else. Do you see me as an outsider?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d These words made Bai Xuan speechless.</p><br/><p>Yes, boyfriend, he promised to be Xie Shurong\u2019s boyfriend of his own accord!</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan felt a bit awkward when he saw Xie Shurong\u2019s serious expression. He also couldn\u2019t help feeling a bit of warmth.</p><br/><p>Yes, there was no need to hide in front of his boyfriend. Bai Xuan thought this and held his shoulder with a frown. \u201cI have a bad stomach. You should take it lightly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xie Shurong\u2019s movements were very careful, as if he was holding a valuable treasure in his arms.</p><br/><p>He gently placed Bai Xuan down on the bed, carefully covered him with a quilt and then quickly turned to find the medicine in his suitcase.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan felt somewhat surprised. He didn\u2019t expect Xie Shurong to have brought more medicine than him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you bring so much medicine?\u201d Bai Xuan asked with a complicated expression.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong replied while pouring water. \u201cYes, I was afraid your stomach wouldn\u2019t be comfortable and that you would get a fever. I brought all types of medicines to prevent problems before they happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>He tasted the warm water. Once he determined it wasn\u2019t too hot, he came over to give Bai Xuan the medicine.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was a bit embarrassed about being helped. It was obvious that this person was younger than him and had the \u2018I will take care of you\u2019 gesture. His movements were very convenient and he was a strong boyfriend.</p><br/><p>It was the first time he was taken care of like this and Bai Xuan accidentally discovered\u2014it felt really good?</p><br/><p>Ah Shu had the consciousness of being a boyfriend\u2026</p><br/><p>He just thought this when Ah Shu got into bed and hugged Bai Xuan gently in his arms. \u201cIf it is difficult then tell me. I will take you to hospital if things become worse. Don\u2019t just endure it, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Bai Xuan responded awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong kissed his forehead and said, \u201cI will learn to cook. Every day I will give you light and digestible things to eat. Your stomach disease should be slowly adjusted. This time you went abroad and couldn\u2019t adapt to eating these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was surprised. \u201cYou want to learn how to cook?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong stared seriously at him. \u201cOf course, it is natural to cook for my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan\u2019s face reddened and a fist slammed into Xie Shurong\u2019s stomach, \u201cWho is your wife? Don\u2019t you have any shame?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t have any shame. Otherwise, who could I catch you?\u201d Xie Shurong grabbed Bai Xuan\u2019s hand, pulled his clothes and directly placed Bai Xuan\u2019s hand on his muscles. He said proudly, \u201cCome touch my abs. It is an eight pack.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan was forced to touch the abs and his fingertips felt the young man\u2019s strong and powerful muscles. He thought of how Xie Shurong said, \u201cYour boyfriend is very good in all aspects\u2019 and evil pictures filled Bai Xuan\u2019s mind. His face couldn\u2019t help turning red and he had to retract his hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong saw his blush, let go of his hand and gently hugged him.\u201dBai Xuan, your illness might not be serious but you must pay attention when eating or you will become sick. I will be distressed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, he touched Bai Xuan\u2019s back in a straightforward and gentle manner.</p><br/><p>He made such a fuss that Bai Xuan\u2019s mood improved a lot. Warmth from his heart slowly flowed through his blood vessels and his cold stomach gradually warmed up.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan didn\u2019t reach out to hold him, instead saying in an exhausted manner, \u201cDon\u2019t talk. I want to sleep for a while\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong immediately said, \u201cSleep, I will watch from next to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The simple words made Bai Xuan feel particularly at ease. He smiled as he closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong\u2019s body had the same warmth as the sun. He was young and his method of expressing his feelings was very straightforward. He was a bit cheeky but he was very sincere.</p><br/><p>This person wasn\u2019t as mature and stable as Bai Xuan\u2019s ideal type but Ah Shu never dropped the chain at critical moments.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was right to choose him as a boyfriend?</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan thought this way and fell asleep in Xie Shurong\u2019s arms.</p><br/><p>In fact, it was almost 3 in the afternoon, which was the time Li Cangyu said to meet.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan felt uncomfortable since noon and now he was sleeping. Xie Shurong sent a text message to Li Cangyu: [Captain, please let me and Bai Xuan take the afternoon meeting off. His stomach is making him feel uncomfortable. I will take care of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was concerned. [How is Xiao Bai\u2019s situation, is it serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong told him: [It shouldn\u2019t be serious. He is just sleeping after taking medicine.]</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu let go of his worries. [If he is uncomfortable, I will arrange for him to not play in the next match. Let him have a good rest. You stay in your room and take care of him. I\u2019ll see you later.]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong quickly replied: [I understand, Captain.]</p><br/><p>Xie Shurong looked at the man sleeping quietly in his arms and his heart softened. He couldn\u2019t help kissing Bai Xuan\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>The gentle Vice-Captain Bai always took care of others. Let Ah Shu take care of you in the future, okay?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

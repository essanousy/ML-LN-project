Milk Dad, go to the labyrinth\u2019s exit as soon as possible and don\u2019t rush to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two little ones typed a 1 on the team channel to make it clear.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu wasn\u2019t able to see the refresh point of the American team but he sensed something. According to the relative balance of how players refreshed in death racing, the number of people who refreshed underwater, in the forest and in the labyrinth should be 2:2:1.</p><br/><p>Bai Xuan wasn\u2019t easy to kill so the most appropriate decision was for the two little guys to go to the dad.</p><br/><p>As for him and Ling Xuefeng, they couldn\u2019t swim for a while and could only watch the situation underwater.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the Lord of the Rings forest area, Xiao Han and Qin Mo were invisible per Li Cangyu\u2019s order. Edmund and Jack of the American team were also lurking in stealth.</p><br/><p>The two great gods of the US team were the world\u2019s top players while Qin Mo and Xiao Han weren\u2019t famous newcomers. If they faced each other, the possibility of Edmund and Jack winning was greater.</p><br/><p>The problem was that the blood kin race could go invisible. Qin Mo and Xiao Han were hidden and the US players couldn\u2019t find them!</p><br/><p>Universal Studios had three themed areas so the forest map of Lord of the Rings wasn\u2019t large compared to a pure forest map. Qin Mo and Xiao Han quickly rushed to the Inception labyrinth area.</p><br/><p>Jack and Edmund searched the forest for a long time and didn\u2019t find anything. Edmund spoke in the voice channel, \u201cIt is likely that the two blood kin players refreshed in the forest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Noah said, \u201cThey must\u2019ve gone to join their teammates. Quickly head to the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the labyrinth of Inception, Bai Xuan was moving cautiously on his own. In contrast, the American team\u2019s Thomas was boldly moving through the labyrinth. After all, he was familiar with the terrain and an elf moved quickly. It didn\u2019t take long before he found the Chinese player in the maze.</p><br/><p>It was a healer!</p><br/><p>Thomas had a straightforward personality which applied to the game. The moment he saw the healer, he fired Seize Life Shot at Bai Xuan. Bai Xuan was calm and immediately placed the Healing Language buff on his body before continuing to move forward.</p><br/><p>Thomash chased him and shot another arrow but Bai Xuan didn\u2019t care. He just gave himself a small healing magic.</p><br/><p>\u2014Shock Shot!</p><br/><p>There was another arrow and Bai Xuan was too lazy to add blood. It wasn\u2019t until Thomas fired Rapid Shot that Bai Xuan healed himself and returned to full blood.</p><br/><p>This image made many people cry from laughter and the domestic audience even ridiculed Thomas. [It is like Vice-Captain Bai is teasing a child!] [Thomas looks fierce but for our dad, it hurts like a tickle!] [Vice-Captain Bai can endure for a long time under the firepower of three great gods. Wake up if you want to kill our dad alone!]</p><br/><p>Thomas was a US player with a black history of throwing the ball in the wrong side at the previous Carnival. Thus, the domestic audience was familiar with him. This guy\u2019s personal explosiveness was very strong but his tactics were awful. Without Noah, he was a wild horse.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t stupid. Continuing to fight Bai Xuan was just a trick. After fighting a while and discovering that Bai Xuan was still full of blood, he gave up the plan to kill this person in the labyrinth. He told his captain, \u201cThe labyrinth contains a priest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Noah\u2019s heart was happy. \u201cIt seems that both summoners refreshed in the water. Alyssa, get ready!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes Captain!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shipwreck at the bottom of the water had an upper and lower floor structure. Li Cangyu refreshed in the lower level while Ling Xuefeng was on the upper level. The shipwreck was customized according to the Titanic stimulation and the area was so large that it wasn\u2019t simple for the two people to meet.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, they had a tacit understanding and didn\u2019t need to talk to know how to find each other.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu quickly swam out of the room. The interior of the ship was very messy and there were many obstacles in the corridor. Li Cangyu swam along the corridor to the exit. However, he hadn\u2019t climbed up the stairs when he saw two figures in front of him. They were Noah and Eliza!</p><br/><p>Due to familiarity with the shipwreck, the two US players joined together and blocked Li Cangyu at the exit.</p><br/><p>\u2014Shadow Winding! God\u2019s Seal!</p><br/><p>Noah and Alyssa\u2019s skills hit at the same time, setting Li Cangyu in place while applying a negative state to him.</p><br/><p>\u2014Death Curse, God\u2019s Light, Voice of Combat!</p><br/><p>The black magic and white magic hit over and over. The elf summoner was very weak in defense and was beaten to half blood by this wave of skills. There was also the blood loss from the negative state!</p><br/><p>\u201cCat God\u2019s situation is very bad. He happened to be ambushed by the two American players and blocked underwater. The terrain is also unfavourable for him since the narrow corridor makes it hard to control his pets. He must climb to the deck as soon as possible!\u201d Kou Hongyi spoke quickly. \u201cFortunately, Captain Ling has realized this point and rushed over to support!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng reacted quickly. He turned when he saw the team panel showing Li Cangyu\u2019s blood loss and went through the exit, swimming to the lower floor.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu was blocked by the two US players at the stairway. There were five layers of negative black magic on his body and the white magic attacks continued. HIs blood had fallen to the dangerous state of 15%.</p><br/><p>Just then, his eyes lit up. Ling Xuefeng had arrived!</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t see Ling Xuefeng in his vision but he knew that the other person had come because the blue dot representing Ling Xuefeng on the small map had reached his coordinates.</p><br/><p>The audience had the god\u2019s perspective and found that Ling Xuefeng was hiding behind a cargo stacking box. The two US players were attacking Li Cangyu with full force and couldn\u2019t see him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng quickly summoned the banshee and used Witch Demon\u2019s Curse.</p><br/><p>A violent force came from behind and the caught off guard American players were pulled directly to the bottom of the ship by the banshee.</p><br/><p>The shipwreck was approximately 10 metres high and this was just in the range that the banshee could be summoned. He summoned the banshee under the ship and forcibly pulled Noah and Alyssa away.</p><br/><p>The group pull successfully saved Li Cangyu from death!</p><br/><p>He finally got a chance to catch his breath. Li Cangyu quickly swam up and retreated under Ling Xuefeng\u2019s cover. Then he summoned the water spirit and thunder spirit at a very fast speed.</p><br/><p>The two US players were pulled to the bottom of the ship and took some time to come back up. Ling Xuefeng took the chance to summon his demon god, placing the demon god on the bow and pulling out the group attack, Demon God\u2019s Descent!</p><br/><p>Black smoke scattered from the demon god. This was followed by the summoning of four skeleton infantry to confine the two opponents.</p><br/><p>The demon god hit perfectly and the other side\u2019s blood fell to 70%. Ling Xuefeng immediately exploded the skeletons and pressed them to 50% half blood.</p><br/><p>Of course, Noah wasn\u2019t to be outdone. He was at the bottom of the water but he cast the group control skill, Dark Fear.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng couldn\u2019t avoid this skill and Noah immediately placed five layers of Death Curse on him. Alyssa followed with God\u2019s Belief and Voice of Combat. The fierce black and white magic also hit Ling Xuefeng\u2019s blood to 50%.</p><br/><p>The skeleton confinement was lifted and Noah and Alyssa finally climbed onto the deck.</p><br/><p>Noah was trying to cast a black magic spell to force Ling Xuefeng\u2019s blood down. At this moment, a large wave of hail rolled in and froze the two people in place.</p><br/><p>It was Li Cangyu\u2019s water spirit!</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t\u2019 have to look back to judge that Li Cangyu was nearby.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlyssa, go kill him!\u201d Noah immediately ordered. Alyssa paid attention and used Purification to remove the ice. Then she quickly caught up with Li Cangyu.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu only had 15% blood left. She could take his head with a simple spell.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t that easy to chase an elf!</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu used Flying Feather Steps to escape and it was still effective underwater. The elf who used Flying Feather Steps was like a flexible fish in the water. His swimming speed was fast and he could also swing to the left and right. Alyssa couldn\u2019t hit him with any skills.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, her targeted skill God\u2019s Light would soon be available.</p><br/><p>A targeted skill meant she could hit the locked target as long as they were within range. Alyssa calculated the cooldown time and pressed her finger against the shortcut key in advance.</p><br/><p>Countdown 3, 2, 1, cooldown was over!</p><br/><p>God\u2019s Light!</p><br/><p>The white magician\u2019s targeted skill immediately opened but she heard a system prompt: [The other party isn\u2019t in range.]</p><br/><p>Alyssa was stunned. Once she took a closer look, she discovered that the moment her cooldown had ended, Ling Xuefeng dragged her back a few metres using the banshee\u2019s strong pull. The result was that she couldn\u2019t hit Li Cangyu!</p><br/><p>Seeing the elf summoner with only a bit of blood still alive in front of her, Alyssa really wanted to vomit out blood.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s banshee was too annoying. Every time they were about to kill Li Cangyu, Ling Xuefeng would drag them away with the banshee. She was also forced to acknowledge the understanding between them.</p><br/><p>In the distance, Li Cangyu was out of danger and turned to use the group attack, Thunder\u2019s Wrath.</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng\u2019s pulling skill was quite skillful. He just placed Alyssa in a place where she couldn\u2019t hit Li Cangyu but Li Cangyu\u2019s pet could hit her.</p><br/><p>This was the classic summoner, pet and opponent triangular positioning.</p><br/><p>This time, the triangle wasn\u2019t completed by Li Cangyu independently controlling the pet but was helped by Ling Xuefeng. It was as if Ling Xuefeng entered Li Cangyu\u2019s mind and clearly knew what he wanted to do next, meaning he was ready to help in advance.</p><br/><p>The two people cooperated perfectly and used the thunder spirit\u2019s big move to drop Alyssa\u2019s blood to 25%!</p><br/><p>Noah rushed to support but was imprisoned by Ling Xuefeng\u2019s skeletons.</p><br/><p>Li Cangyu took advantage of the water spirit\u2019s Water Ball to quickly attack Alyssa. His hands were fast and the Water Ball was released continuously. They smashed Alyssa and looked quite gorgeous underwater.</p><br/><p>The damage that burst out in a few seconds completely emptied out Alyssa\u2019s blood.</p><br/><p>\u2014First blood!</p><br/><p>The bloody elf summoner escaped and counterattacked to complete the kill!</p><br/><p>Under Ling Xuefeng\u2019s strong protection and assistance, Li Cangyu actually won the first head!</p><br/><p>This was absolutely uplifting!</p><br/><p>Ling Xuefeng opened his mouth and gave rare praise. \u201cBeautiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was calm but Li Cangyu still smiled.</p><br/><p>The attack power of the US team\u2019s two magicians was truly amazing and worthy of being world-class level. Under the water, Li Cangyu was almost caught by the two of them. If it wasn\u2019t for Ling Xuefeng using the banshee twice at key moments, perhaps Li Cangyu would\u2019ve already fallen down and it would\u2019ve been impossible for him to kill Alyssa.</p><br/><p>This was the importance of having a strong partner!</p><br/><p>As he played the game today, Li Cangyu always felt that all his thoughts were read by Ling Xuefeng in advance. Moreover, Ling Xuefeng always made the most suitable operation for Li Cangyu. The angle and position of every skill release was just right. It was like the brain waves of the two people were completely synchronized.</p><br/><p>\u2018You gave exactly what I need most!\u2019</p><br/><p>This was the unparalleled understanding between Ling Xuefeng and Li Cangyu on the field!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If he ended up frustrating his grandfather and his grandfather gives an edict to pass the throne to him, then his leisurely days would be over. Passing down the throne to his grandson and not his son wasn\u2019t going against the law of the ancient sages\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and the other ladies sat in a circle looking at Ling Tian with a bright smile. Ling Chen was to the left of Ling Tian, Li Xue was to the right of Ling Tian, Yu BingYan was to the left of Ling Chen, Shui QianRou to the right of Li Xue, followed by Xiao YanXue and Princess JiaoYue. It can be said that Ling Tian\u2019s harem was beginning to take shape and gathered over here\u2026</p><br/><p>In terms of martial arts, Ling Chen and Li Xue were sufficient to sweep half the world. In terms of wisdom, Ling Chen, Li Xue and Shui QianRou did not lose to anyone else. In terms of business mindset, the only few people in the world capable of being a match for Xiao YanXue was Ling Tian and his mother Chu Ting\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Such a combination was definitely considered to be extremely extravagant.</p><br/><p>Currently, Ling Tian was surrounded with beauties all around him with their fragrance drifting around in the room. Young noble Ling and little young noble Ling both had their faces reddened as they stood up straight with their chests puffed out proudly.</p><br/><p>After starving for such a long time, it would probably be time for him to satisfy his hunger tonight right?</p><br/><p>\u201cEmpire\u2019s title?\u201d Ling Chen let out a frown, \u201cWhat should it be?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian glared at her, \u201cThis is what I am asking all of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just call it the Ling Empire?\u201d Yu BingYan thought for a moment before saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo old fashioned! Too dull!\u201d Shui QianRou shook her head with dissatisfaction and pondered for a while before saying, \u201cWhat about Ling Tian Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnbearably dull! How can Tian\u2019ge\u2019s name be used as the title of an empire? If that\u2019s the case, wouldn\u2019t everybody be using Tian\u2019ge\u2019s name whenever they talk about the empire?\u201d Xiao YanXue immediately retorted, \u201cThey way I see it, we might as well call it the Heaven Empire! It is concise and pretty nice as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and die, you should be the one going to heaven.\u201d Li Xue smacked Xiao YanXue on the bum.</p><br/><p>\u201cSit down, sit down.\u201d Ling Tian ordered. He then glanced at Li Xue. Why does this lass enjoy following me? Why does she enjoy smacking the bum of ladies? However, that feeling is truly\u2026 hehehe\u2026</p><br/><p>Thinking about that, Ling Tian suddenly had a flash of inspiration. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we name the empire the Divine Prefecture Chinese Socialist Empire. How about that?\u201d Ling Tian asked with delight.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough cough\u2026\u201d Li Xue began coughing incessantly and she couldn\u2019t catch her breath. \u201cYou nationalistic idiot! To think that you can even think about that! Cough cough\u2026 I am going to choke to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the other ladies looked at each other with a look of bewilderment. They truly did not understand the meaning behind these strange words. Is it truly such a great name? Why don\u2019t we think so? Also\u2026 what does nationalistic mean?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so bad about this name? It has so much sentimental value,\u201d Ling Tian muttered under his breath.</p><br/><p>Li Xue rolled her eyes and said with exasperation, \u201cThere isn\u2019t anything bad about it. It is truly filled with sentimental value! But don\u2019t you feel that it is completely out of place when being used on this continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian snorted and did not allow anyone to reject his proposition, \u201cIn any case, I have already come to a decision. It can either be called the \u2018Divine Prefecture Empire\u2019 or \u2018Chinese Empire\u2019. Just these two names, choose one. Which do you think is better?\u201d</p><br/><p>All the ladies were baffled! They did not understand the reason for Ling Tian\u2019s insistence!</p><br/><p>Looking at Ling Tian, all the girls became speechless. Since you have already made a decision, what is the point of gathering all of us to have a \u2018discussion\u2019? All of them looked at Ling Tian with disdain.</p><br/><p>How would Ling Tian be bothered by this? He then said solemnly without a change of expression, \u201cHow about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnything!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the ladies said in unison and ignored Ling Tian entirely. They then began chatting about fashion and tips to protect their skin from being tanned.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian asked again with frustration, \u201cAre both names not good?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ladies lifted their heads up and replied again in unison, \u201cAnything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was in a rage.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stood up with frustration, \u201cLi Xue, follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue asked lazily, \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian snorted and displayed a look of anger before storming out. Li Xue rolled her eyes before following behind Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Tian\u2019ge really angry?\u201d Xiao YanXue asked with unease.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Did we go too far?\u201d Princess JiaoYue asked carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe definitely wouldn\u2019t be. While I do not know the reason why, young noble definitely wouldn\u2019t be angered because of something so small.\u201d Ling Chen said with confidence, \u201cHe probably has some other thing frustrating him. However, the biggest possibility is that he is feigning it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeigning it?\u201d The ladies came to a realization. As they recalled Ling Tian\u2019s expression, they could not help but burst out into giggles.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, even if he is really angry, there isn\u2019t a need to be afraid.\u201d Shui QianRou smiled, \u201cI have an idea. After tonight, he definitely won\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the idea? Tell us quickly.\u201d All the ladies asked curiously. Even Ling Chen who understood Ling Tian the most looked with curiosity. With her understanding of Ling Tian, she knew that the moment Ling Tian was angry, someone\u2019s blood would probably have to be spilled before his anger was quelled. Hearing that Shui QianRou actually had an idea, she looked with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe.\u201d Shui QianRou smiled and raised her eyebrows, \u201cTian\u2019ge has truly been greatly stifled during this period and he hasn\u2019t done that for more than a month. As long as sister Chen and BingYan serve him well tonight, his anger will definitely be subsided by tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u2026.\u201d All the ladies let out a squeal and their faces turned red. Ling Chen and Yu BingYan who were the parties involved looked like two tomatoes. They then chased after Shui QianRou and Ling Chen scolded laughingly, \u201cThis little brat is spouting nonsense, everyone beat her up together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan said with her face red, \u201cIsn\u2019t this outcome all because of you? To think that you still have the face to say such words.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the ladies immediately looked at Yu BingYan. Why was it all because of Shui QianRou?</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan was extremely embarrassed and refused to say a thing.</p><br/><p>A long while later, everyone found out from Shui QianRou\u2019s lips that during the few days before they boarded the ship, because Shui QianRou had already confirmed her relationship with Ling Tian, Ling Tian had wanted to do that with her. However, Shui QianRou had always maintained the last barrier and insisted that she would only do it with Ling Tian in their nuptial chamber. Helpless, Ling Tian could only seek Yu BingYan. However, Yu BingYan\u2019s stamina was far too weak and could not last for a long time resulting in Ling Tian\u2019s suffering. When they were on the ship, even if Ling Tian had the heart and Shui QianRou was willing, they were completely helpless because of Justice\u2019s presence.</p><br/><p>All the ladies burst out into laughter together as they teased each other. Shui QianRou looked around to see if there was anyone else around before mimicking Yu BingYan\u2019s voice and imitating how she pleaded to Ling Tian. Yu BingYan was completely embarrassed and she immediately escaped from the room.</p><br/><p>While the faces of all the ladies were reddened, they laughed merrily to the point their sides ached.</p><br/><p>Outside the door, Li Xue smiled and looked at Ling Tian, \u201cAre you really that concerned? It is just a name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a sigh and looked towards the sky with a fuzzy gaze, \u201cI believe that we will never be able to return but both you and I will always be the descendants of the yellow people! We will forever be! I will never forget where my roots are!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s eyes lit up and she looked at Ling Tian with gentleness, \u201cIn truth, both Divine Prefecture Empire and Chinese Empire aren\u2019t too bad. However, it would be difficult to explain the name of Chinese Empire.\u201d Her words were as good as saying that she supported the name of Divine Prefecture Empire!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Ling Tian agreed immediately before asking, \u201cAh Xue, just\u2026 what is going on with JiaoYue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue turned around and looked at Ling Tian for a moment before smiling, \u201cThis is Old Madam\u2019s intention\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a long breath and said with depression, \u201cI knew it. But with your personality, why would you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else can I do? She is your grandmother. Can I possibly reject her? In this generation, polygamy is a common matter and since I cannot reject it, I can only accept it!\u201d Li Xue lowered her head and let out a depressed sigh, \u201cBesides, JiaoYue is also a pitiful lady. Since you can accept Shui QianRou and Xiao YanXue who are supposed to be your enemies, why can\u2019t you accept JiaoYue?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue looked at Ling Tian with her eyes lit up, \u201cYou killed many of Yu BingYan\u2019s kin and it can be said that Shui QianRou\u2019s brother had died because of your machinations. As for the army of Xiao YanXue\u2019s family, you had slaughtered at least four hundred to five hundred thousand of them! You can accept Yu BingYan, you can accept Shui QianRou, you can also accept Xiao YanXue, but why do you have a mental barrier when facing JiaoYue? As long as JiaoYue can love you with all her heart, why do you need to bother about her status? With your current status, don\u2019t you have the confidence to give your women happiness? I truly don\u2019t understand what you are thinking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian took two steps back as though he was enlightened. That\u2019s right, I can kill the members of the Yu Family, Shui Family, Xiao Family, and even the Long Family because my final target is the safety of my family members. It is also because of this that I will lift up the flags of the Divine Prefecture Empire!</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, your harem will have Ling Chen, Yu BingYan, Shui QianRou, Xiao YanXue and I. Which one of us sisters are simple characters? If you are afraid that JiaoYue will have other thoughts in the future\u2026 it\u2019s best if you hurry up. She would not be a match for anyone of us so what is the point for you to worry? Besides, she is your biological cousin after all and this is the wish of your grandparents. Why can\u2019t you just fulfill their wishes?\u201d Li Xue continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I have always felt that marrying someone so close to me in blood ties is truly\u2026\u201d Ling Tian frowned as though he was struggling.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what? Ever since ancient times, the marriage of those with close blood ties is common\u2026\u201d Li Xue suddenly looked at the strange expression on Ling Tian\u2019s face and knew that she was being teased by him. She immediately flew into a rage, \u201cI am going to beat you up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled and immediately dodged. I finally settled one of my troubles. Since I can accept Yu BingYan, Shui QianRou and Xiao YanXue, why can\u2019t I accept JiaoYue? Stud horse? Since I am already a stud horse, why do I have to erect a monument for myself? Furthermore, would I be able to remain \u2018pure\u2019 in this world until the end?</p><br/><p>Thinking about that, Ling Tian suddenly remembered a joke from his previous life. With his heart knot untied, he could not help but chuckle.</p><br/><p>Li Xue asked curiously, \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian replied with all seriousness, \u201cI finally understood the reason the reason for the heart knot in my heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue looked at the lecherous laugh on Ling Tian\u2019s face and despite knowing that Ling Tian didn\u2019t have anything nice to say, couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause we are too close, I would be too embarrassed to take out my tool.\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s body trembled from laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Li Xue\u2019s face flushed red and kicked Ling Tian on the bum.</p><br/><p>As such, under Ling Tian\u2019s suggestion, all the ministers agreed to the name of \u2018Divine Prefecture Empire\u2019 for the new empire! The name of the new empire was to be kept secret for the time being until the new emperor ascended to the throne in a month\u2019s time!</p><br/><p>Within Sky Bearing City, everyone became busy.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s Yu Family Army was already waiting by the side for the battle in the east to become tense and it would be the best if the Xiao and Ling Family engages in an all-out battle. Who would have thought that after the Xiao Family gathered up their army for half a year, they would cease all of their operations after besieging a city just once?</p><br/><p>This made Yu ManLou who had made ample preparations feel as though the punch which he had been accumulating strength for had hit nothing but air!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, news of the Ling Family making preparations for the new ruler to ascend the throne one month later began to spread. When Yu ManLou heard that piece of news, he smashed a total of three teacups!</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! That Xiao Family is filled with a bunch of useless b*st*rds! They trained up their forces for half a year with the strength of a million soldiers. With the blood debt of 400,000 soldiers and the aid of Above Heavens, why would they suddenly fall silent?\u201d In the imperial garden of the Yu Family\u2019s palace, Yu ManLou was clothed in yellow robes as he cursed under his breath.</p><br/><p>However, even if they were enemies, there was still a need to send out an envoy to congratulate the Ling Family. After all, they were still in-laws in name. Yu ManLou was currently considering who he should allow to go.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Xiao Family also received news.</p><br/><p>After Xiao FengYang\u2019s return, he immediately had a long conversation with Xiao FengHan in a secret chamber.</p><br/><p>Those with keen eyesight would easily be able to tell that after a short half a day of joy, Xiao FengHan began sighing for the entire night. His eyes were filled with indignance, regret, disappointment and many other emotions.</p><br/><p>After a long argument, the two brothers finally came to a conclusion. However, apart from the two of them, there wasn\u2019t a third person who knew the details of their conversation.</p><br/><p>At the same time, news of the Ling Family preparing to set up their empire arrived. Xiao FengHan who received this piece of news was troubled for a long time before letting out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>The envoy party that was sent out from the Xiao Family to Sky Bearing was extremely majestic. Second Master Xiao FengYang who had just returned to the Xiao Family took up the heavy responsibility to lead the envoy personally to Sky Bearing.</p><br/><p>This trip was completely different from the previous one. The last time, the Xiao Family was still high above the Ling Family but now, the thousand-year-old Xiao Family had already waned and the Ling Family had become the ruler of a large empire!</p><br/><p>Fate was truly toying with them. Xiao FengHan who was in the study let out a long sigh with complicated emotions.</p><br/><p>Just when Xiao FengYang was about to bid farewell to his older brother, a drastic change happened.</p><br/><p>A voice sounded from the outside, \u201cReporting to Family Head, Old Celestial Meng requests a meeting.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInvite him in!\u201d Xiao FengHan let out a sigh. Is it finally here? However, so what if Above Heavens have unparalleled martial arts? Will they be able to turn things around? This is obviously a powerful killing weapon that human strength is insufficient to deal with!</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head Xiao, this old man is here to ask you just why the Marshal gave orders to stop the battle at the frontline? As long as we break through the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass, our million man army would swallow the entire Heavenly Star! At that time, we would be able to proclaim ourselves ruler of the entire continent! For Second Master to escape from the Ling Family, it should be a joyous occasion to celebrate. I wonder why an order would be given for our army to stop when the morale of our army is at the highest? I think that you should give me an explanation, right?\u201d A grey hair elder walked into the room. While his words were directed at Xiao FengHan, his gaze was fixed on Xiao FengYang!</p><br/><p>\u201cMay Elder Meng calm down, there is naturally a reason for this.\u201d Xiao FengYang smiled as he replied. However, his heart was filled with anger. The person before him was Meng FanYun, who held the authority of Above Heavens in his hands, and the Xiao Family treated him like he was a celestial character. Since he was a powerful force behind the Xiao Family, he naturally belonged to the faction which supported battle. The influence that he had on the decisions of the Xiao Family was no less than Xiao FengHan!</p><br/><p>But regardless of his strength, he was only a guest in terms of status. He and his brother were the true decision makers of the Xiao Family. Now that they were in the midst of an important discussion, Meng FanYun had actually barged into the place and it truly seemed as though he was seizing the authority of the host! A thought suddenly sprouted in Xiao FengYang\u2019s head, What if we can let Ling Tian\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Meng may not know,\u201d Xiao FengHan chuckled, \u201cif not for Second Brother rushing back in time, we may have suffered an unacceptable loss. The Ling Family had developed an extremely frightening weapon and the might of the weapon is sufficient to tear down the mountains. The cutting off of the Blue Jade River was also a result of this weapon. This weapon has already been spread into the army of the Ling Family and our army suffered huge losses in battle because of that weapon. Thus, my second brother and I came to the conclusion that we should handle matters carefully before we are able to find a way to deal with the weapon. If we bury our army because of a rash move, there would truly be no turning back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by powerful weapon? They are no more than some parlor tricks. How would it be a match for our million man army?\u201d Meng FanYun snorted coldly and glared at Xiao FengYang, \u201cSecond Master, were you scared silly by the enemy or were you convinced by Ling Tian to surrender? If not, with Ling Tian\u2019s means, how would an important captive like you be able to escape so easily? Family Head must not forget that more than ten of my Above Heavens have perished under the Ling Family\u2019s little tricks! For those experts to be killed so easily, it is truly a strange matter for Second Master Xiao to return without any injuries.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Where are you injured?!\u201d Right now, he still possessed a last bit of hope. However, all that was dashed the moment the words left his mouth as he saw his son\u2019s corpse, dead with his eyes wide open. His son\u2019s head had been pierced all the way through by a sharp arrow!</p><br/><p>\u201cWHO DID THIS?!\u201d Lei ZhenTian jumped in fury, gazing at the crowd with bloodshot eyes.</p><br/><p>The various warriors of the Lei Family cast their eyes full of hatred in a certain direction. Over at that side, two ladies were leaning on each other, heaving big gulps of air with every breath. They gazed back at Lei ZhenTian, their eyes meeting his that were full of overwhelming hate!</p><br/><p>\u201cLowly wretch! I\u2019ll kill you! Be buried along with my son!\u201d Lei ZhenTian exploded in fury and flipped himself up into the air before rushing toward the two ladies. He channeled his full strength in mid-air, bringing with him the sound of lightning and howling winds, as though he could not be blocked!</p><br/><p>This was the strongest move of the Lei Family, the Heavenly Penta Lightning Sutra, being utilized at maximum capacity. Even if Ling Tian were to arrive now, or even if Yu ManLou was present, they would have to avoid this full-powered strike of his!</p><br/><p>Because the two ladies were totally sapped of strength, especially Shui QianRou since her life-threatening arrow had practically sapped her of all her powers. She was only relying on the support of Yu BingYan to remain standing, so how could she avoid Lei ZhenTian\u2019s fatal strike? The two ladies had the heart but not the strength, and could only close their eyes and await death!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Mistress!\u201d A few frenzied shouts rang out, followed by a series of dull thuds\u2026. as the voices sounded, a few originally collapsed disciples from the Ling Family suddenly let out a final spurt of strength, throwing themselves headlong before Lei ZhenTian\u2019s palm in order to shield the two ladies behind them.</p><br/><p>A cruel smile hung on the corners of Lei ZhenTian\u2019s mouth. With merely a wave of his hand, these few loyal and devoted warriors were slapped dead, their bodies burned black like charcoal just as though they were struck by lightning! As for Lei ZhenTian, his body posture remained unchanged as he continued swooping down on them!</p><br/><p>Xue Leng and Xue Fei, the two brothers, were already bone-tired from the battle, but upon seeing Yu BingYan in danger, they dredged out the last bit of strength within their body to rise up and stand before Yu BingYan, blocking the attack from Lei ZhenTian.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Family\u2019s swordplay?\u201d Lei ZhenTian\u2019s eyes twitched a little, but he suddenly shouted out, \u201cSo what if it\u2019s the Yu Family? If you killed my son, you have to pay with your life!\u201d He mercilessly threw out both of his palms forward!</p><br/><p>Two screams were heard as the Xue brothers were thrown back to the ground on the spot. The light in their eyes immediately dimmed as they profusely vomited out blood that contained bits and pieces of their internal organs. Both of them stared with wide eyes at Yu BingYan, trying to say something, but eventually collapsed onto the ground before they could speak. From the shape their lips were making, it was \u201cQuickly run!\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of the anger affecting his heart, his innate protective skill was weakened. Under the final death blows with the Xue brothers, Lei ZhenTian was also slightly injured. He then stopped his assault and hollered instead, \u201cKill them all, don\u2019t leave one alive!\u201d Upon hearing that, the Lei Family warriors swarmed forward like a wave of water.</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian\u2019s figure swayed as he gazed at his son\u2019s ice-cold corpse, finally unable to hold back two streams of tears as they cascaded down his face. He originally thought that this would be an easy battle to complete with the main force of the Ling Family not present. But he never imagined that he would lose over half of his own troops and even sacrifice his only son in this battle!</p><br/><p>This sort of shock was something Lei ZhenTian was unable to accept, causing his mind to snap from the anger and sadness.</p><br/><p>As the sound of rushing wind rang out, Ling Feng and Ling Yun, covered in blood, appeared in front of Yu BingYan. They were nearby battling it out, and upon seeing the situation become grim, immediately ignored the danger to their lives to rush over. Both were covered in injuries, and Ling Yun even suffered two deep slashes across his face, forming the number ten (). Not only was his face bloodied, even his nose bridge was broken, but the killing intent he exuded was still as strong as ever, without any intention to retreat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Mistress, Miss Shui, if you do not wish for any more of our brothers to sacrifice themselves for you, then please hurry and retreat.\u201d Ling Feng\u2019s voice was not loud, but it drilled clearly into the hearts of both women. He also knew that only through this method would the two ladies then temporarily retreat.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan sluggishly looked at the corpses of the Xue brothers who had accompanied her throughout her life. She was so heartbroken that she could not even talk, her mind a completely blank slate. Shui QianRou\u2019s reaction was faster, affixing herself to Yu BingYan and stubbornly dragging both of them back.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill the ladies and take revenge for our young master!\u201d As the Lei Family warriors pounced forward in apparent craziness, Ling Yun and Ling Feng exchanged glances, both letting out an unrestrained smile. Ling Feng laughed loudly as he spoke, \u201cBrother, it seems like this is going to be our final battle together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Yun only smirked, causing the wound on his face to open and fresh blood to further seep out, creating a macabre scene. He laughed out loud as well, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing big about that, at least we can still be brothers in our next life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! We\u2019ll still be brothers in our next life!\u201d Ling Feng heartily laughed before lowering his voice and solemnly saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a pity that we did not get to see Young Noble and Brother Jian one last time. This is probably my only regret.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDumbass!\u201d Ling Yun scolded harshly, huffily retorting, \u201cIf we could see Young Noble and Brother Jian, would we even still have a chance to die?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026 hahahaha\u2026.\u201d Amid their laughter, the two youth assassins rushed toward the crowd of enemies, knowing full well that they might die! But they were duty-bound not to turn back!</p><br/><p>Behind the crowd of Lei Family warriors, there were another two relentlessly killing their way over. They fought without any care for their own well-being, their bodies stained with the blood of their enemies as well as their own! Clearing their throats, they seemed to almost be crying as they screamed out loud, \u201cLing Feng, Ling Yun, if you dare to just die like that, then our other forty-eight brothers will darned well make sure that we disown you! F**k you two self-centered brats, Ling Feng and Ling Yun! Just try it, I dare you!!!\u201d These two were precisely Ling Dian and Ling Lei.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the peril that Ling Feng and Yun were in, they too unhesitatingly threw down what they had on hand to rush over. However, due to the distance, they were too late! Ling Feng and Ling Yun\u2019s shadows had already merged in with the relentless human wave that was the Lei Family warriors!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Ling Chen with one sword fended off the three deacons, falling into an absolute disadvantage the moment they first exchanged blows. After all, having a strong aura did not mean anything in terms of combat ability! The three old men were not Lei XiaoSong either, and without a shred of pity for a beautiful lady, all their moves were powerful and ruthless, aiming for her life. Ling Chen\u2019s body swayed within the sharp sword winds like a naked candle bracing against the strong winds, with the possibility of being snuffed out at any given moment\u2026</p><br/><p>Peng! One of the old men shot forwards, planting a palm on her lower abdomen before quickly retreating, celebrating the fact that he landed a blow. However, a sword suddenly flashed into existence, with Ling Chen taking the chance to slice off his offending arm. He fell to the ground, rolling and groaning in pain.</p><br/><p>Having been attacked on the lower abdomen, Ling Chen felt her world darken, and her true qi was in disorder after the strike. Coupled with the fact that she forcibly pushed herself to execute that sword move, she couldn\u2019t take it any longer and fell toward the ground like a broken kite. In mid-air, her mouth opened and out came a mouthful of bright crimson blood\u2026</p><br/><p>The other two elderly men snorted in anger, as one went to support his comrade while the other shot forward like lightning towards Ling Chen, his palm acting as a sword as it shot towards her throat, intending to finish her off!</p><br/><p>At this life and death moment\u2026</p><br/><p>Peng! A black shadow fell down from the air, a palm solidly landing on the attacking elder\u2019s chest. The elder ricocheted backward like a rubber ball as a contemptuous voice sounded, \u201cTo think that three elderly men, with a total age of above 200, would actually join hands to attack a lady around seventeen to eighteen years of age. Isn\u2019t that laughable?!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the person spoke, he had already caught onto Ling Chen\u2019s slim waist with one hand, bringing her as he soared backward for almost a hundred feet, just like an otherworldly immortal. As they descended, his other empty fist clenched and thrust out, causing a strong gale to blow, knocking back the dozen or more Lei Family warriors that wanted to surge up to them.</p><br/><p>At the spot where they last exchanged blows, the three deacons of the Lei Family were gazing at the black shadow in suspicion and trepidation. They shared a glance as they asked, \u201cWho is that person?\u201d Disbelief could be seen in their eyes as they collectively took a gasp of cold air, \u201cCould it be\u2026 HIM?!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was during this moment that another black shadow soundlessly floated out into existence only a mere forty to fifty feet in front of them, his hand holding onto a long and thin sword as he thrust out!</p><br/><p>Before the three deacons could react, the sword had already pierced through and withdrawn from the Second Deacon, and even as the latter\u2019s body started to weaken and collapse to the ground, the sword had already pierced through the First Deacon\u2019s back!</p><br/><p>The First Deacon of the Lei Family forcibly twisted his body, striking out a vicious backhand onto his assailant\u2019s chest! With a \u2018wa\u2019 sound, the assailant spat out a huge mouth of blood, but kept a death grip on his sword, dragging it across the deacon\u2019s body. The latter\u2019s eyes revealed an expression of incredulity as his waist opened up and his organs spilled onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Due to the extreme strength used in his retaliation, all of the great deacon\u2019s internal energy was transferred to his back. In addition to that, he tried to protect his organs from damage by surrounding them with internal energy and trapping the sword in place. He originally wanted to use the force to snap the sword, to prevent further harm to his body. He never expected the sword to be so resilient that instead of snapping it rebounded and sliced a path through his body! This ended up with the current scenario of his waist being sliced apart. Even his muscles strengthened by his internal energy were cut apart like tofu in front of this sword!</p><br/><p>This was the famed saying, \u201cJoining hands with the assassin to kill oneself!\u201d</p><br/><p>As for the assailant, it was precisely the heavily injured Ling Chi!</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the sounds of the assault, Ling Chi was aware that the opposing force had a much larger strength, and that the Ling Family Courtyard was in peril. How could he only care about his own well being to be squirreled away to hide? He secretly slipped out, and hiding behind a tree, he planned for the opportune time to strike. Upon seeing the fight between Ling Chen and Lei ZhenTian, he secretly migrated to their location.</p><br/><p>Ling Chi\u2019s original intention was to save Ling Chen and spend his life in exchange for assassinating Lei ZhenTian! With his acute senses, he had already noticed that Lei ZhenTian was not someone who ignored his surroundings even in battle, so he had to wait till the latter\u2019s internal energy was almost exhausted before he made his move.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Every now and then, an armed patrol would go by, casting investigative glances at the few people who still dared to stick their heads out of their houses. Ling Tian could astutely see that within the patrols there were people consisting of two different factions, with totally different attitudes and behaviors.</p><br/><p>One faction was a group of soldiers dressed in deep yellow colors, but their attitudes were incomparably depressing, and they constantly let out terrified as well as uneasy looks on their faces. While they looked like they were patrolling the area, judging by their pushover looks, they would be more suited if one said that they were just passing by.</p><br/><p>The other patrol consisted of people robed in light blue, full of confidence, constantly hollering and displaying their tyranny. Each of them looked full of energy and exuberance, with incisive and piercing gazes. Not only did they stand up tall and straight, they were also perfectly disciplined. As they patrolled, their movements were swift and decisive, extremely firm.</p><br/><p>Two type of troops, with heaven and earth differences in behaviors. This immediately made Ling Tian notice, allowing him to realize that hidden within should have some sort of subtle meaning. This was especially so when the two patrolling troops intersected with each other on the streets. Those in light blue would immediately stick out their chests in pride, arrogantly looking past them, as though their comrades were invisible to them. The group in blue would purposely push forward and bump into the other as though they were trying to pick a fight.</p><br/><p>As for that yellow group in question, expressions of suppressed anger and humiliation would show on their faces, but they could only keep quiet out of fear and duck by the roadside, as though afraid to offend the other party. Not only so, but as the blue-robed guards passed by them, the patrol in yellow even had to bow towards them! The head guard even had an expression of flattery on his face, and from what Ling Tian observed, a subtle hint of self-loathing!</p><br/><p>Observing from the side, Ling Tian only coldly watched as the events unfolded. It was only after the same incident occurred many times that his heart finally came to the conclusion. Those in yellow were likely the ex-imperial family guards, and those in blue were likely to be the private troops of the Yu Family. That would explain their overbearing and insufferably arrogant attitude. However, from Ling Tian\u2019s point, he could see that although both were ordinary soldiers without martial background, one could see that the light blue guards appeared to be more elite as compared as to the ex-imperial guards. They could not even be compared in the same breath, akin to heaven and earth, which would explain the basis of their pride.</p><br/><p>Following closely behind every patrol team were a few people in clean white robes paired with a few people dressed in purple robes, surveilling the surroundings. From Ling Tian\u2019s divine sense, he could detect minute movements of clothes fluttering even up at the rooftops. It was likely they belonged to the experts of the Yu Family observing the entire city.</p><br/><p>Every now and then, there would be people being dragged out of the taverns and inns, trussed up and taken away. The sounds of crying, pleading, beating, and cursing mingled into one. Occasionally, there would even be a scream coming out from an alley. The entire city had turned into a chaotic mess.</p><br/><p>This operation of the Yu Family was sufficient enough to determine the cold-blooded actions of Yu ManLou!</p><br/><p>He would rather kill the innocent than to let off the guilty!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian lowered his head and slowly walked across, all the while using his divine sense to maintain awareness of his surroundings. In just this short moment, Ling Tian was already greatly shocked. For Yu ManLou to be able to mobilize such a huge force was completely out of his expectations. Based on the normally sized hideout that he was living in, Ling Tian could deduce that Yu Family had deployed more than ten thousand men for the operation this time around! It could be said that the Yu Family had gone all-out with their forces!</p><br/><p>After another round of careful deliberation, Ling Tian immediately understood the intentions of Yu ManLou, and could not help but let out a smirk. This Yu ManLou really knew how to grasp opportunities, even such a matter had also been calculated by them, going active instead of passively waiting!</p><br/><p>Indeed, it could be said that in some ways, the trouble that his nemesis Yu ManLou could cause him was above that of Heavenly Justice himself!</p><br/><p>Taking advantage of the fact that the diplomats of the various empires were still situated in Bright Jade City, this move of the Yu Family was first to weed out any opposition in the pretext of searching for the murderer, and second to flaunt their prestige! Just from the scene of them activating over ten thousand people in half the night, as well as their unyielding attitude, this allowed for the greatest intimidation of the various influences who hadn\u2019t picked a side!</p><br/><p>If you want to become the enemy of my Yu Family, then you had better first ponder about your own strength! The Yu Family is able to mobilize over ten thousand men in half a night\u2019s time, if a war really breaks out, how much time do you think we would need to gather our full force?</p><br/><p>Following this path of thinking, this strength the Yu Family displayed was enough to allow every major influence to tremble in fear. The reason was if the Yu Family could display such shocking preparedness even in times of peace, then this was naturally the strength on their surface level. So how much more strength did they keep hidden?</p><br/><p>Intimidation!</p><br/><p>Utter intimidation!</p><br/><p>Indeed a wily old fox! Ling Tian cursed Yu ManLou internally as he strode forward in huge steps, turning past another alley before his eyes lit up. At the same time, a thick and heavy scent of cosmetics and powder floating into his nose, causing him to feel an unbearable itch, almost making him sneeze. In front of him was a large courtyard with three separate three-storied pavilions forming a triangle around it. On the front-most pavilion, there was a huge inscribed board on its top floor displayed to the world, stretching from the second to the top floor. Three huge words were written: Floating Fragrance Pavilion!</p><br/><p>On the streets outside, the screams of misery could be heard nonstop, but surprisingly, after entering the pavilion, the atmosphere did not seem to be affected. Tittering laughter could be heard everywhere, accompanied by songs and dances, as well as overly-exaggerated mewls could be heard from everywhere. It was a completely different experience as compared to the cold killing atmosphere outside.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stroked his nose, feeling a little astounded. Such grandeur, even in his previous life, in those provincial government houses, might not even compare in terms of magnificence. The wealth present was blinding, and one could tell that there were no restrictions in opening a brothel as compared to his previous life.</p><br/><p>\u201cAiyoh, is this not Boss Zhao? Really a rare surprise, Boss Zhao has not been here for three days already, and the ladies are all anxiously waiting for you. Hehe, if our ladies fall lovesick because of you, then the medical fees would be charged on your tab, okay?\u201d Ling Tian had not even stepped into the Floating Fragrance Pavilion, but a voice that gave him the goosebumps had already sounded from afar.</p><br/><p>Looking in that direction, Ling Tian almost felt like vomiting!</p><br/><p>A stocky and well-built female bouncer appeared, wearing a bright red silk dress which was plastered all around her figure. The folds of fats were completely accentuated, and her pasty round face, thickly powdered with makeup, was coupled with a head of gleaming oily hair that probably could reflect one\u2019s appearance. Her fat lips were also painted bright red, with a rose held in her hair at her temple. In her hands was a silk handkerchief heavily scented with perfume that she coquettishly waved in front of him, as she constantly winked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes, I was quite busy the last two days. Look, aren\u2019t I here now?\u201d Ling Tian dryly laughed and took out a piece of silver to enter the place.</p><br/><p>However, the female bouncer twisted her bear-like waist, attempting to give off the appearance of a slender female gracefully moving as she blocked off his path. She suddenly smiled, causing the thick layer of powder on her face to cascade off and form a little snowdrift by her feet as she spoke in the most \u2018lovable\u2019 voice she could muster, \u201cBoss Zhao is really generous today, hohoho, are you looking for Little Hong today? Or is it Little Cui? Little Min? Or maybe Little Hua?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt a wave of dizziness strike him. D*mn it, to think that this Boss Zhao had so many \u2018contacts\u2019 in this place!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I came to look for Miss QianQian today.\u201d Ling Tian could only force out a smile. \u201cI have some business to discuss with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBusiness affairs? And looking specifically for Miss QianQian? Why don\u2019t you speak to me about it? I, Little Guai, still have some say in this!\u201d As she spoke, her stocky body started to lean in towards him. Ling Tian had zero doubts that if the original Boss Zhao was present, he would probably lose his life the moment she squashed him!</p><br/><p>Little Guai! To think that this creature that probably looked like she weighed over 400 catty 1 would be named \u2018Little \u2018 Guai!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could only forcibly cough some more in embarrassment, but only ended up breathing in more powder from her. He felt as though he had been transported back once again to the heavily polluted districts in the 21st Century of his previous life. A sort of suffocating feeling could be felt, and he instinctively thought, What sort of brand produced this kind of inferior powder? He could bear it no longer, and replied, \u201cBut the business has always been run by Miss QianQian, so how could I approach someone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChe! So much moral integrity! Is it not because you have your eyes on that shameless hussy? Men, bring him inside!\u201d The enormous Little Guai suddenly had a change in expression and turned her head back to holler. However, because of her excessive movements, a whole chunk of cosmetic powder dropped off from her face, landing on the ground with a \u2018pa\u2019 sound.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt his stomach turn again. Luckily for him, he had remembered not to eat anything before he came.</p><br/><p>Along came two other women who were more acceptable looking, bringing Ling Tian to the second pavilion behind, and after finding him an elegant room and pouring some tea, they went off to report.</p><br/><p>In a moment, light footsteps were heard and the door screen was pulled open, revealing a lithe and delicate young girl who walked in. Her facial features were exquisite, but there were hints of impatience currently present on her face.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian held the teacup in his hand. Seeing her walk in, his eyes gazed at her, but he did not get up to greet her, nor did he speak.</p><br/><p>Her delicate and pretty face immediately showed signs of anger as she unhappily spoke, \u201cBoss Zhao, hasn\u2019t our business been concluded? The money and goods have been accounted for, and we do not owe each other anything any longer. What business do we still have to talk about? To use such an excuse to bring me over, what is your motive?\u201d Her tone was overbearing, obviously she did not place this great merchant of Bright Jade City in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian deeply gazed at her, before nonchalantly flipping the cup of tea on his hands, overturning it on the table. He suddenly spoke in a serious voice, \u201cThe Heavenly Emperor silences the tiger!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d QianQian immediately covered her mouth with her slender hand in astonishment. A look of disbelief passed through her face, and it was only after a long time did she finally calm down and cautiously reply, \u201cThe pagoda seals the demon!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, she immediately asked in astonishment, \u201cBoss Zhao is actually one of us?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

We are only asking you so that we can have some mental preparation, lest we end up being reprimanded by the Family Head again. You darn killing maniac, it is as though saying something will make you lose a piece of flesh.\u201d</p><br/><p>That cold voice turned even colder, \u201cIt has been more than ten years already. Since when were you able to get anything out from me? Why can\u2019t you just learn to accept that?\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d A low frustrated curse sounded. As the three of them walked past a small tree, none of them looked up and none of them realized that the legendary number one assassin was right above their heads!</p><br/><p>Seeing the three of them leave, Ling Jian began to worry. For Yu ManLou to call for a meeting at such a time, there must definitely be something important! What can it be? Could it be that the Yu Family has found our hiding place? Or could the Yu Family have found out news about young noble? Apart from that, I can\u2019t think of another reason for Yu ManLou to gather men so late in the night! Ling Jian thought to himself anxiously. Of these two possibilities, Ling Jian felt that it was necessary for him to find out more!</p><br/><p>However, how would it be easy for him to spy on the conversation of the Family Head?</p><br/><p>While Ling Jian was confident that his inner qi, movement techniques, and swordplay were exceptional, he was not overconfident to think that there wouldn\u2019t be a single person in the huge Yu Residence who had inner qi above his own. Just the Family Head, Yu ManLou, was already an extremely frightening character. Who knew just how powerful the Yu Family Head was? While Yu ManLou had never taken action personally in the past few years, there weren\u2019t many in the world who dared to look down on him! Perhaps only the Martial Order Medallion owner would dare to do so!</p><br/><p>Apart from being the number one assassin in the world, Ling Jian felt that he wasn\u2019t exceptional in all other areas. He originally only intended to spy on the general situation of the Yu Family to make a prediction of their strength. However, he was currently in a pinch! Should he go or not?</p><br/><p>If he went, there was more than a 90% chance for him to be spotted! In the face of the Yu Family\u2019s elites, there would be less than a 30% chance for him to escape!</p><br/><p>Just what should he do?!</p><br/><p>The sound of footsteps could be heard and the final patrol squad of the Yu Family was about to arrive!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have much time left! Ling Jian clenched his teeth. How can I gain rewards without taking any risks? So what if I die for the young noble?</p><br/><p>The trees were silent and awaiting the rain!</p><br/><p>Seeing the patrol squad leave, Ling Jian no longer hesitated and darted into the air. Just a hair\u2019s breadth away from the flowers and branches, Ling Jian nimbly traversed the Yu Residence and landed stealthily on the Moon Climbing Star Picking Tower. In the world today, there would definitely be less than five people capable of achieving what he had just done!</p><br/><p>While Ling Jian had brushed past the flowers and branches, not a single leaf or petal moved an inch! Not a single blade of grass or leaf was stuck to his clothes!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian carefully revealed half of his head as he peered into the Martial Pointer Pavilion, which was covered by vegetation, 500 feet away.</p><br/><p>The three figures from before had already entered the Martial Pointer Pavilion and Ling Jian only had the chance to catch their back view. From afar, there were many more rushing over from all the different directions. As Ling Jian spread his spiritual sense out, he was shocked to realize that the individuals approaching were all top-notch experts! Judging from the way they walked, all of their movement techniques were not weaker than Yu ManTian! If Ling Jian were to judge their cultivation from their movement technique, then the strength of the Yu Family was far too frightening!</p><br/><p>Was the foundation of the thousand-year-old Yu Family really that frightening?!</p><br/><p>Just like when Ling Tian held a meeting, he would only invite the upper echelons of his organization. If that\u2019s the case, this meant that each of these experts would probably have a force under their command! These men were probably Yu ManLou\u2019s final trump card! The biggest trump card of the Yu Family!</p><br/><p>Even if this was the only piece of news Ling Jian received tonight, it wouldn\u2019t be a waste of his trip here! However, Ling Jian wasn\u2019t satisfied with this result! Just because his trip wasn\u2019t a waste didn\u2019t mean that it was a success!</p><br/><p>Why did Yu ManLou gather all of these people? What did he want to discuss? What are the details of the discussion? These were the questions that Ling Jian was the most concerned about! It was very likely that Yu ManLou was devising a trap to be used on his young noble! Ling Jian would never escape at this moment. Knowing that Yu ManLou might be plotting against his young noble, it would be impossible for Ling Jian to leave before finding out the details of the operation!</p><br/><p>Humans are always like that, never satisfied with what they have and always desiring more. However, greed will always bring about misfortune. Will Ling Jian be an exception this time?!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was extremely clear that he only had a single chance to land on the roof of the Martial Pointer Pavilion without the experts finding out about him. That was the moment everyone entered the Martial Pointer Pavilion! Everyone\u2019s attention would be scattered, and this included the Yu Family Head, Yu ManLou, the most powerful and deeply hidden enemy! If Ling Jian were to miss that opportunity, he would have to go back empty handed today and his life might even be in danger!</p><br/><p>However, the biggest problem was that Ling Jian was just too far away from the position he wanted to go. It was a full 500 feet away from him! To any movement technique expert in the world, that was an unbreachable gap! Furthermore, there were definitely numerous bells laid between both the buildings. Even Ling Tian and Justice\u2019s chances of breaching that gap wasn\u2019t too optimistic!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Jian decided to still give it a try! To perform this action that no one else would dare to try! Ling Jian took a deep breath, and his body slid out from the pavilion like a thin piece of paper gliding smoothly in the wind\u2026</p><br/><p>The two people at the north of him obviously didn\u2019t have their guard up at all. Perhaps they felt that the interior of the Yu Family\u2019s residence was definitely the safest place they could be. If Ling Jian were to take action now, he had complete confidence of turning these two experts, who were no weaker than Yu ManTian, into corpses in just an instant!</p><br/><p>It was a pity\u2026</p><br/><p>Leaning on a tree silently, Ling Jian hid his silhouette and suppressed his racing heartbeat. He tried his best to remember the route and speed of these two experts. After the two of them had walked another 300 feet and were about to enter the Martial Pointer Pavilion, Ling Jian made his move!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Ling Jian unleashed his movement technique to a never before height! Like a formless shadow, his figure blurred for a moment before disappearing completely. Even if someone were to witness that sight, he would definitely think that he was seeing things.</p><br/><p>When Ling Jian unleashed his movement technique this time, the hem of his robes didn\u2019t even move and not even a strand of his hair shifted out of place! This top-notch movement technique that combined both extreme silence and movement could definitely be considered earth shattering!</p><br/><p>The movement technique that Ling Jian exploded forth with was definitely on par with Ling Tian or even on a slightly higher level! In just an instant, Ling Jian had shortened the distance by 100 feet!</p><br/><p>His back was already drenched in sweat! Even if he was the number one cold-blooded assassin in the world, his heart was still thumping from that risky action of his.</p><br/><p>It was far too dangerous! A slight mistake would mean his death!</p><br/><p>Gauging the distance in front of him, Ling Jian paused after traveling for another 50 feet and observed his surroundings carefully. By circulating his inner qi, Ling Jian silently ascended to the branch of a tall tree and let out a small breath. A pure wave of inner qi then spread out to all of his limbs. The moment the last two individuals entered the Martial Pointer Pavilion was also the moment Ling Jian took action!</p><br/><p>A slight mistake would ensure his death. However, Ling Jian was able to flawlessly arrive where he was up until now!</p><br/><p>The last two individuals had taken a step into the Martial Pointer Pavilion! A soft wave of laughter could be heard. The people inside must have been laughing at the two for being late.</p><br/><p>The best and only opportunity!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s figure drifted up and rose 20 feet into the air. He then made a flip in the air and flew towards the Martial Pointer Pavilion. The whole process was extremely slow and without any sound.</p><br/><p>In general, speed and variation would determine the level of success one\u2019s movement technique was at. But when one\u2019s movement technique progressed to a certain level, the next step would be to perfectly control their speed. \u2018Silent like a virgin and active like an escaping rabbit\u2019 followed such a logic! However, while it was easy to be fast, it was extremely difficult to be slow. Especially when one was suspended in mid-air. Everyone knows that suspending one\u2019s body in mid-air was something that defied gravity and was an impossible task. But once one\u2019s movement technique advanced to a certain stage, while he wouldn\u2019t be able to pause in mid-air, he could prolong the duration of being in the air.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s technique of floating in mid-air was something that belonged only to Ling Tian in this world!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian actually spent a full two breaths covering a distance that ordinary experts would cover in an instant! His body landed gently on the Martial Pointer Pavilion\u2019s roof like a snowflake on a snowy night.</p><br/><p>A complete success!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

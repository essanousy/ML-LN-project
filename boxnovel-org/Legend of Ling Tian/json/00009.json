It was as though he had returned to the ocean, the only time in his past life that he could ever feel at ease. Lying on the cradle gave him the impression that he was on board his yacht, facing the sunset and feeling the waves bob the boat up and down. As such, for this period of a year, Ling Tian spent almost half of it lying in that cradle.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019er, my darling.\u201d A gentle voice drifted over, causing the corners of his mouth to unconsciously tug upwards into a happy smile. With hands as delicate as snow and soft as cotton, they lightly pulled him into an embrace. Looking upwards, a tender and warm face filled his vision, with eyes full of indulgent love. This was Ling Tian\u2019s mother, Chu Ting\u2019er. Beside her was a middle-aged man, about thirty years of age, with a squared face streaked with resoluteness. Hmm, he could still be considered handsome. A gentle smile rested upon his face, akin to the spring winds, and an expression of satisfaction could be seen from his eyes. This could only be his father, the one who possessed the most authority in the military inside the Empire, the Head General Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stooped over, giving Ling Tian\u2019s delicate baby face a light kiss. The stubble on his face felt like steel needles, bringing a brief moment of discomfort to Ling Tian, to which Ling Tian glared at him in unhappiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, this little fellow seems to be unwilling, hmph hmph\u2026 I\u2019ll give you more to be unhappy about, haha!\u201d As he spoke, Ling Xiao gave him two more kisses. Ling Tian ended up with a face full of saliva.</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er playfully pushed her husband to the side, saying, \u201cShoo shoo shoo, your beard is so stiff, you\u2019re prickling the baby.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, is that so? Why didn\u2019t you voice it out last night then? Heh heh heh\u2026 Aiyah!\u201d Ling Xiao spoke, only to have the tender part of his waist being severely pinched by an angry and embarrassed Chu Ting\u2019er. Ling Tian did not need to cast his eyes over to guess how wretched his father\u2019s face was right then. At that point, he suddenly understood this famous saying from his previous life: love and pain will always go hand in hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur son is just beside us; what nonsense are you spouting now? To think you are already a father!\u201d Still simmering with the remnants of her anger, Chu Ting\u2019er rebuked huffily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, what can this small child possibly know? Don\u2019t you agree with me, son?\u201d With the reply appeared a handsome face in front of Ling Tian, winking at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Woo\u2026 stop meddling!\u201d Hearing the voice of the close-to-exploding Chu Ting\u2019er suddenly become much softer, Ling Tian looked over, only to see her buxom and towering chest being impressively covered by a lecherous hand softly massaging it.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was filled with fury! F**k, are you treating me like I\u2019m invisible by displaying such poisonous scenes to corrupt a young person\u2019s mind so publicly? Ling Tian angrily grabbed onto that lecherous hand, viciously hauling it off.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! Our son is blaming me for infringing on his territory, hoho!\u201d A crisp and bright laughing voice sounded out.</p><br/><p>With her chest finally freed, Chu Ting\u2019er, with a face flushed with embarrassment, spoke half laughingly and half in embarrassed anger, \u201cYou baddie!\u201d This soul-stirring sight moved Ling Xiao and he couldn\u2019t help but lightly grasped onto his wife\u2019s slender waist and moved towards her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cDong!\u201d However, a kick on his stomach from Ling Tian, still in his mother\u2019s embrace, effectively shut him down.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahaha! This little fellow is so domineering!\u201d The couple laughed out together this time round.</p><br/><p>A pair of footsteps was intermittently heard as it drew closer, before the person spoke, \u201cSire, Madam, the guests have arrived. The Grand Sire requests that Sire and Madam make their appearance.\u201d The voice belonged to a delicate and pretty-faced servant girl standing beside the couple who lightly whispered to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, I understand. Go tell the Grand Sire that we will be right there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy goodness, this should be the Young Master right? Ever since this old man stepped out of Phoenix Cry this year, it is my first time seeing a baby! This is a little token from me, nothing great.\u201d Carrying their son, Ling Xiao and his wife had just walked into the grand hall when a viridian colored jade charm floated in front of little Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir Wang came all the way from another kingdom, braving much hardships. How could I accept this sort of generous gift from you? Please retract your gift sir,\u201d Ling Xiao courteously replied.</p><br/><p>This Sir Wang was an old man with a snow white beard and a body covered with well-made robes. Both his hair and beard were meticulously trimmed and one could tell that he paid the utmost attention to his bearing. Ling Tian curiously opened his eyes, only to see Sir Wang showing his displeasure by blowing up his beard.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral Ling\u2019s words have a problem there; this gift was presented as a token for your son\u2019s first year, and not for General Ling. With so many imperial officials on scene, General Ling doesn\u2019t have to worry about any possible imperial impeachment because of bribery!\u201d The crowd burst into laughter at his words, echoing his sentiments.</p><br/><p>He had to be joking; Ling Xiao was currently akin to the Right-Hand Minister, with authority below one and above tens of thousands. Even if an official was tempted with greed, who would dare to go onboard this tiger to pick its fleas? Impeach him? That person had to be sick of living! The officials present all thought silently to themselves: This old man Wang just caused all of us to break out in cold sweat with that one joke!</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, if that is the case, it would be disrespectful for me to reject you. Then, let this Ling accept your gift in place of my son.\u201d Ling Xiao only cracked a smile, seemingly unaffected by this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, this is exactly the opposite; it is General who is giving me respect instead!\u201d Ling Tian could not help but roll his eyes; it seemed like this person was going all out to flatter his father, so he couldn\u2019t possibly be part of the enemy camp.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas this little brat been named yet?\u201d A similarly white-haired old man moved over this time. Ling Tian received a shock. He was already a year old, but it was the first time someone had dared to call him \u201clittle brat\u201d in front of his grandfather and father. It seemed like this guy was not as simple as he seemed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Old Yang, this old man here handpicked the name. He\u2019s called Ling Tian, isn\u2019t the name splendid?\u201d His grandfather, Ling Zhan, stood up as he spoke while laughing. As he listened, the more Ling Tian felt that something was wrong. Although Ling Zhan\u2019s words contained a trace of laughter, Ling Tian could sense a deeply buried hint of coldness. It seemed like this Old Yang\u2026 wasn\u2019t a simple person at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cPa! Pa!\u201d As Old Yang lightly clapped, he praised, \u201cIndeed your style, Grandfather Ling, to even give such a domineering name to your grandson. Good, such an imposing name, hahaha! I desire to rise above the heavens, mm, what a good name this is!\u201d [1]</p><br/><p>As he finished speaking, the whole hall of over tens of people immediately fell into absolute silence!</p><br/><p>This Old Yang\u2019s words could be said to have committed a capital offence. The emperor was also known as the heavens, and yet Ling Zhan gave his grandson the name of Ling Tian. Even though it could be passed off as a joke, one could also frame Ling Zhan for heresy.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehehe, this statesman is too polite. Just like how your grandson was named Yang Huang, this old man got a rude shock when I heard it that day, wondering when the Yangs actually gave birth to an emperor. Hehe\u2026\u201d Ling Zhan\u2019s eyes flashed with a chilling ray, not yielding in the slightest. [2]</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was enlightened, as so it turned out, this old chap was actually the head of the Yang family, Yang KongQun. They were the only ones out of the six great family clans in the Sky-Bearing Empire who had the ability to contend against the Ling family. So they were the bad guys. No wonder his face looks like it is constantly asking for a beating! Ling Tian thought to himself angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, so from your Old Ling\u2019s words, ordinary folks are prohibited to name their children with the characters of \u2018dragon\u2019 or \u2018phoenix\u2019? Aren\u2019t you being too much of a nitpick, Old Ling!\u201d Twirling his goatee, Yang KongQun spoke smilingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehehe, if a single phrase from this old man is nitpicking, is it logical for you to talk about my grandson?\u201d Ling Zhan was full of anger. Damn that Old Yang. When his grandson was born, Ling Zhan had gone there with good intentions to congratulate him. However, not only did Yang KongQun not return this favor, he chose a day like his grandson\u2019s first year celebration to pollute the atmosphere! If he had known this was going to happen, he would have stirred that wine he prepared for Old Yang\u2019s grandson\u2019s full month into a pot of mixed soup before sending it to them!</p><br/><p>Both old men glared at each other like cocks fighting for supremacy, neither willing to compromise. The surrounding civil and military officials could only look at each other in dismay, keeping mum in fear.</p><br/><p>These two men were people in the Sky-Bearing Empire whose feet could cause the land to shake by just a mere step, and whom their own classes could not afford to offend. One was the Ling family\u2019s clan head, the Empire\u2019s number one Duke, parent of the imperial consort and Head General; the other was the Yang family\u2019s clan head, the current Prime Minister of this empire, father of the present empress, father-in-law of the current emperor!</p><br/><p>If one were to seek death and attempt to interrupt them, they would bring upon themselves a disaster of epic proportions. Those seated nearer to both the old men started to wipe their sweat surreptitiously while edging backwards. All came with good intentions to flatter them and get into their good books, yet they ended up in the middle of a battle between the apex powers of the Empire. The crowd could only lament their misfortune.</p><br/><p>Yang KongQun puffed up his goatee and said, \u201cOld Ling, this old man here was only making a casual remark. When did I ever say that your grandson\u2019s name wasn\u2019t good? This old man here came with good intentions to congratulate you, but look at you, repaying kindness with animosity.\u201d [3]</p><br/><p>Ling Zhan drew back the corners of his mouth, forming a smile that was not really a smile, as he retorted: \u201cThat is true. Both of us old fogeys gave good names to our grandchildren. However, this old man\u2019s grandson\u2019s seems to be brighter than yours, heeheehee.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang KongQun decided to quit while he was ahead and only chuckled, \u201cYou may say that, but this old man is much busier as compared to you. Haiz, I have to placate three grandsons every day, and the worst part is that I still have two granddaughters. One minute I\u2019m carrying one, the next, another; this gives me backaches. This kind of hardship is hard to endure. Unlike you, Old Ling, who only has one and is so free, only having to carry him once every few days. You even have time to spend taking care of your garden. What an envious lifestyle!\u201d As he spoke, the latter hammered at his waist in pretense with a face full of grievances.</p><br/><p>Although Ling Zhan was fuming deep inside, he could not come up with a suitable retort. His family was small in number, especially so in Ling Tian\u2019s generation, where only \u201cOne seedling could be seen in a three thousand miles plot of land\u201d. [4] Yang KongQun\u2019s words were obviously targeting at the fact that his house was not as flourishing as his. However, the truth was as such, and Ling Zhan could not straighten his back from this insult. He could only hatefully glare at his son as he scolded, \u201cUseless thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had his arms coiled around his wife and child all this while, engrossed with watching the two old men fight it out. How could he have foreseen disaster falling from the sky? Now that his own father\u2019s anger was directed towards him, he could only shrink back without a word, putting on a bitter expression. If his father were to suggest that he take a concubine in front of the crowd, he would be placed in a difficult situation.</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er\u2019s face was red with embarrassment and anger. Stretching out her slim fingers that were smooth as jade, she gave her husband\u2019s waist a vicious pinch and twist. As a daughter-in-law, she naturally could not speak out even if the Grand Sire\u2019s mouth was without tact. However, by her side was a human punching bag; it would be a waste if she did not utilize it!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao could only draw in a breath of cold air, grimacing in pain.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s little face appeared to be excited at the whole lively scene that was unfolding in front of him. However, he was actually sneering to himself: Old Yang, you need not look so pleased. Since you dared to offend this Young Master here, I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019ll send your three grandsons into the palace to be eunuchs in a few years\u2019 time and trick your two granddaughters over to be my concubines. Then I\u2019ll see how arrogant you can be! Heh heh heh\u2026</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the battle between the two come to an end, the crowd could also finally breathe easy. They immediately burst out into idle chatter in an attempt to shift the attention of the two old men away from each other in case they decided to go for another round. If they were to start another battle, then wouldn\u2019t everyone that had come here today seem like they were here for the purpose of watching a show instead of celebrating? Furthermore, how could anyone of their class be able to such a fiery show without penalty?</p><br/><p>Conveniently at that moment, an earth-shattering sharp voice sounded from the front door, \u201cThe Emperor, Empress and the Imperial Consort have arrived!\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] The surname \u201cLing\u201d in Ling Tian\u2019s name can also mean to rise high(er). In this case, paired with his name of \u201cTian\u201d, meaning sky or heavens, his name means to rise higher than the heavens itself.</p><br/><p>[2] The \u201cHuang\u201d in the name Yang Huang is a homonym that sounds like emperor. Thus, the grandfather was rebutting that they named their child as an emperor, which was also treasonous.</p><br/><p>[3] Actual phrase for \u201crepaying kindness with animosity\u201d was supposed to be \u201cDog Bites L\u00fc Dongbin\u201d. The original phrase says \u201c,\u201d, which is trying to say that the dog (person) cannot tell the good person\u2019s intentions and thus bites the hand that feeds it.</p><br/><p>[4] \u201cOne seedling could be seen in a three thousand miles plot of land\u201d literally refers to the fact that Ling Tian was the only offspring of his generation. Do note that the Chinese mile is only 500 meters.</p>\n</div>"}

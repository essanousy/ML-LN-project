The number one assassin in the world had a solemn expression on his face and his body was like a tyrannical spear with his breathing heavy. At the same time, his sword was already unsheathed and in his hand! He was completely ready to do battle!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian had no choice but to be careful. If Ling Tian and the rest were to be disturbed at this moment, the battle strength of their Ling Family would be completely wiped out! He cannot allow any accident to happen! Thus, Ling Jian was currently in a state of extreme readiness.</p><br/><p>Apart from Ling Jian, the others had already been chased out of this place.</p><br/><p>Li Xue originally suggested that Justice could personally guard the place to ensure that nothing would go wrong, but Ling Tian did not want Justice to know too many of his secrets. Especially the fact that he had the inner pellet of a flood dragon. Even if he was using the heart of a despicable individual to measure the magnanimity of a gentleman, he couldn\u2019t be bothered.</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian trusted Justice\u2019s character, Justice had chased after the Shui Family experts for hundreds of miles just to obtain a small Sandalwood Pearl. If Justice were to take a liking to the flood dragon\u2019s inner pellet, he would be in big trouble! While both the Sandalwood Pearl and inner pellet were like miracle medicines to treat injuries, the Sandalwood Pearl was not even in the same league as the inner pellet!</p><br/><p>Even if he knew that Justice would not set his eye on the inner pellet, Ling Tian still had to act carefully! Ling Tian would not allow anything to go wrong! Thus, Ling Tian decided that Ling Jian was the best candidate to keep guard.</p><br/><p>However, Justice wasn\u2019t completely idle either. Ling Tian invited Justice to \u2018rest\u2019 on the outside and if there were enemies, the enemies would have to first pass through Justice. As such, his defenses could be said to be impenetrable!</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian described the whole process of purging the Divine Black Negative Meridians casually, he knew that this was one of the biggest events in his Ling Family Courtyard. The three giants of the Courtyard were involved in this process and they could not be disturbed the moment the process started. Even a slightly louder than normal sound would be enough to send the four of them into cultivation deviation.</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Tian had no choice but to be careful. While there was already the iron defense of Justice on the outside, Ling Tian had still decided to make Ling Jian set up another line of defense on the inside.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian pressed a button and pushing onto the stone wall with force, a series of mechanical sounds could be heard and the stone wall gradually flipped open. The four of them then entered the secret chamber together.</p><br/><p>This was the most concealed location in the Ling Family Courtyard and the place where Ling Tian would meet his aides in secret! In the whole Ling Family Courtyard, there were less than 20 who knew about the existence of this place!</p><br/><p>However, everything that was originally in the room had been removed and only an empty chamber was left. In the large chamber, only piles of dark red charcoal could be seen lining up the sides of the chamber. Apart from that, there was a thick white cloth in the middle of the room and a stack of clean towels. Four large buckets of water were placed in four corners and were covered with a wooden lid.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at the three ladies who were looking at the room with surprise and smiled. He then took out the Night Illumination Pearls of the flood dragon and tied a pearl to Yu BingYan\u2019s hair. After that, he placed another pearl into a small bag and hung it around Yu BingYan\u2019s neck like a necklace.</p><br/><p>The dim glow of the Night Illumination Pearl made Yu BingYan looked as though she was radiating with light and her beauty was all the more emphasized. She looked at Ling Tian and the others with a terrified expression which truly drew the pity of even Li Xue and Ling Chen.</p><br/><p>Li Xue looked at Ling Tian and Ling Tian nodded his head heavily. The faces of the three ladies then flushed red as they looked at each other without making a move.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are all of you standing there for? Quickly undress.\u201d Ling Tian asked.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the three of their faces turned a shade darker. Even the usually crazy Miss Li Xue had her head lowered as she twiddled with the corner of her shirt.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaiz! When the three of you are supposed to be shy, you girls would act boorishly. Now that it isn\u2019t the time for you girls to be shy, all of you are acting in such an embarrassed manner.\u201d Ling Tian sighed and shook his head helplessly, \u201cMy three young Misses, I am not trying to take advantage of you three. In the process of purging such frost toxins, we must ensure that not a single piece of fabric remains on your body, so the toxins can be expelled into the air directly. If there is a layer of cloth, the frost toxins would end up flowing back to your hearts and things would be troublesome. All three of you are also aware of this. Why are you girls acting in such a manner now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue grunted, \u201cWe naturally understand the logic. If it is only the three of us ladies being naked in front of each other, it wouldn\u2019t matter. However, the problem is that there is a man like you in front of us, how can the three of us unwed ladies appear in front of you without any clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed sneakily and winked at Ling Chen, \u201cYou guys suddenly remember that all of you are unwed? While you and Yan\u2019er are indeed unwed ladies, Chen\u2019er is no longer unwed. Hehehe, besides that, Yan\u2019er is already my wife and we are only missing the official ceremony. If not for her Divine Black Negative Meridians, I would have already eaten her whole! You are the only troublesome one here. Do you still want to be my younger sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was obviously trying to eat all the three ladies in front of him!</p><br/><p>Ling Chen let out a wail and she covered her face with her hands squatting down on the ground in embarrassment. Yu BingYan\u2019s cheeks were rosy red and a sense of happiness welled up in her heart. At the same time, she resolutely decided that after the frost toxins in her body was purged, she must definitely become his man!</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Tian determination to eat them all up, Li Xue\u2019s face turned red, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we make a barrier with cloth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian rolled his eyes and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference with wearing clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>In actual fact, it was truly a feasible solution but young noble Ling Tian would not be willing to waste this chance which he had been planning for so long. Besides that, Ling Tian wanted to make use of this opportunity to honestly express his feelings towards the ladies and set the foundation for them all to share the same bed with him together in future\u2026</p><br/><p>After this incident, the three ladies would definitely have fewer objections and that would not need to remain as just a dream\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing the look of suspicions on the three of their faces, Ling Tian continued, \u201cBesides that, all of you are going to be my wives sooner or later. There is no need to be afraid of embarrassment! Miss Li, please don\u2019t say that you want to be my younger sister, it is already too late for that. I am just taking a look at you, just take it that I am taking a loan before our wedding. Besides that, what is wrong with being seen by your husband? Unless you aren\u2019t willing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian finished his words, the three embarrassed ladies charged forward brandishing their fists in embarrassed fury. Ling Tian\u2019s words had made the three of them both furious and embarrassed. Now that they had the chance, they must definitely teach Ling Tian a good lesson. While they were definitely willing to let their husband take a look at them, how could they not teach Ling Tian a lesson when he said it in such a despicable manner?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian hugged his head and curled up in a ball, crying out in pain. After the three ladies finally vented their anger, they looked at each other and burst out into giggles.</p><br/><p>Li Xue suddenly looked at Ling Chen and said, \u201cSince younger sister Chen has already become one with him, I think that you don\u2019t need to be shy. Why doesn\u2019t younger sister Chen start first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s face became bright red as she stammered, \u201cWhy\u2026 why\u2026 why me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue grunted twice and purposely said in a strange tone, \u201cWho asked you to enjoy the benefits of a favorable position and go before all of your sisters. If not you, then who?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen was completely embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian began to sweat profusely! This demoness truly dared to say anything.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan had spent the most time with Ling Chen and was extremely close to her. Seeing Ling Chen speechless, she decided to come to Ling Chen\u2019s aid, \u201cElder sister Li, your relationship with our husband is the best and have already begun addressing each other as brother and sister. Since our husband has acknowledged you, you can be first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue immediately changed targets, \u201cNo no no, I would only address him as my elder brother at the most but the two of you are already addressing him as \u2018husband\u2019. Since younger sister Chen isn\u2019t willing, why don\u2019t you go first?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Yu BingYan realized that she was attracting fire to herself, she betrayed Ling Chen immediately, \u201cElder sister Chen has spent the most time together with our husband and also went through a formal ceremony with him. I think we should let elder sister Chen go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The three of them were stuck in a stalemate in regards to who should undress first. In any case, none of them were willing to be the first one,</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was anxious to the point he almost had ulcers in his mouth, \u201cMy dear ladies, this isn\u2019t a joking matter and a human life is at stake. I really\u2026\u201d Rubbing his head and pacing around the room, young noble Ling Tian truly had no plans at all.</p><br/><p>An idea suddenly came into Li Xue\u2019s head, \u201cI have an idea. Let us play rock, paper, scissors. The one who loses shall be the first to strip. We shall rely on our luck. How about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was the first one to agree excitedly, \u201cCount me in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet to the side!\u201d The three ladies roared together.</p><br/><p>Finally, under Ling Tian\u2019s insistence, he managed to squeeze himself into the game shamelessly. The four of them gathered into a circle and the three ladies had a serious expression on their faces as though they were about to go into battle\u2026</p><br/><p>Rock\u2026 paper\u2026 scissors!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was completely dumbfounded!</p><br/><p>The three ladies burst out into laughter together.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan, Li Xue and Ling Chen all chose rock\u2026</p><br/><p>Only young noble Ling Tian chose scissors\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is the justice\u2026 I am actually the first one to lose\u2026\u201d Ling Tian muttered and looked at his two fingers in a daze. He never imagined he would lose in the very first round. In fact, it wasn\u2019t anything strange either. After all, his head was completely filled with dirty thoughts and it would be a strange matter if he didn\u2019t lose\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said that there isn\u2019t justice. Isn\u2019t Justice right outside? Time to fulfill your bet! Strip! Quickly strip!\u201d The three ladies cried out together with delight.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s body trembled and he felt as though he was an innocent young child who had fallen into a den of female wolves.</p><br/><p>With his hands on his waist, Ling Tian let out a bitter laugh. No wonder the three ladies refused to strip. With everyone still being fully clothed and staring at you, it was truly extremely embarrassing to strip in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>Even Ling Tian\u2019s extremely thick skin turned red\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and strip! What are you waiting for? Are you still a man? How can you be so wishy-washy, a human life is at stake here!\u201d The three ladies jeered together and returned Ling Tian\u2019s words to him.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face turned red and he wanted to find a hole to bury himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrip! Strip quickly!\u201d The three ladies shouted together.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy goodness\u2026 my three queens, this little one\u2026 shall obey your orders. I hope that the three queens will be gentle\u2026 it\u2026 it is my first time\u2026\u201d Ling Tian decided that he might as well put up a show.</p><br/><p>Your first time? You should tell that to the ghosts!</p><br/><p>Under the disdainful looks of the three ladies, Ling Tian slowly untied his belt. Since he could not avoid the matter, Ling Tian might as well shut his eyes and swiftly get it over and done with. In just a short few seconds, all of his clothes disappeared and only a pair of shorts was left behind, wrapping a large bundle under it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLecher! Shameless!\u201d The three ladies shrieked together and covered their faces at the same time. The three of them never imagined that Ling Tian would be so sporty and take everything off in a few short seconds.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shook his head helplessly, \u201cI didn\u2019t want to strip but you girls forced me to do so. Now that I complied, I turned into a shameless lecher\u2026 My dear three young Miss, aren\u2019t the three of you too difficult to please? Where is the justice?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them burst out laughing together and Ling Tian realized that while the three of them covered their faces with their hands, they obviously left a gap between their fingers and were obviously taking a sneak peek!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian snorted twice and flexed his muscles like he was a bodybuilder, \u201cHow about it? Do I look good? Is my figure wonderful?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh!\u201d The three ladies snorted with disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking about me, the three of you should hurry up. If you drag matters on, the sky will turn dark.\u201d Ling Tian pestered with impatience. At the same time, his eyes glowed a lecherous green\u2026</p><br/><p>With Ling Tian pestering them, the three of them forgot to tease him and became anxious. The three of them hid their hands behind their backs and a look of seriousness could be seen on their faces.</p><br/><p>An intense battle unfolded again. After two rounds, two delighted chuckles sounded and someone finally lost\u2026</p><br/><p>The one who lost was the main character of today: Yu BingYan.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan\u2019s face was already as red as a red cloth and she had forgotten all about her fear from the Divine Black Negative Meridians. Her head was lowered and her whole body stiff\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to fulfill your bet! Strip!\u201d Ling Tian roared and felt a trace of satisfaction in his heart\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI just don\u2019t want to!\u201d Yu BingYan wailed and sat on the ground hugging her knees. She curled up like an egg and hid her head in knees.</p><br/><p>This lass had actually begun to act shamelessly. Ling Chen and Li Xue looked at each other helplessly.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was extremely magnanimous, he waved his hands and said, \u201cYou two continue, let me take care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then squatted down and chuckled, \u201cYan\u2019er, let me give you two choices. Number one, you strip on your own. Of course, you can leave your undergarments. Number two, I will strip you down personally. Hehehe\u2026 I can guarantee you that not a single piece of cloth will be left on your body. How about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan raised her head up shyly and looked at Ling Tian, \u201cI\u2026 I can keep my undergarment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can keep it if you want.\u201d Ling Tian nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Yu BingYan grunted and stomped her feet before taking a peek at the three others, \u201cYou guys\u2026 turn around\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and Li Xue chuckled as they looked from the side happily, \u201cLittle sister BingYan, we are all ladies, what\u2019s there to be embarrassed about? When the three of us bathed together, we have already seen it all! Look at your shy appearance, so useless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan looked at the other two and pouted angrily, \u201cThe two of you better not be too delighted. It will be both of your turns soon. Do the two of you think that you can escape?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two ladies froze up and glared back at Yu BingYan.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian watched from the side with interest, and seeing the reddened faces of the three ladies, he felt an immense sense of satisfaction in his heart. Knowing that the three ladies would never strip with him around, he said, \u201cI will go and light the charcoal first and the three of you should not delay matters for too long. It is only a matter of time and we need to quickly purge the Divine Black Negative Meridians from BingYan. Li Xue, you are the one who is the most familiar with the inner pellet of the flood dragon and should make ample preparations. Ling Chen, aid BingYan in consuming a Great Cyclic Pellet. Remember, you must immediately help her to absorb the medicinal effect. Right after the medicinal effect of the Great Cyclic Pellet is fully unleashed, BingYan\u2019s meridians will be at their peak and you must let her consume a small amount of the inner pellet. At that time, all the charcoal in the room will be lit. With us being in the middle, it would be fire from the outside and inside, the best environment to purge the Divine Black Negative Meridians. I should be able to borrow the external fire of this place to suppress the frost toxins with my Divine Shocking Dragon Formula.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then said with regret, \u201cWhat a pity, I am only able to use this red charcoal capable of burning for three days and nights. If I could find the legendary XianTian pure flame, it would be perfect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue laughed out loud. \u201cIf you were in possession of a XianTian pure flame, you would be at the thirteenth level at the very least, right? That is a legendary realm that no one has ever reached! Besides that, if you really had the ability, you could directly refine the Divine Black Negative Meridians in BingYan\u2019s body and she would turn into a peerless expert in a single night! What a pity, you are only at the tenth stage presently,\u201d Li Xue disdainfully said.</p><br/><p>Being interrupted, the awkwardness of the three ladies was greatly reduced. Looking at the naked Ling Tian lighting up the charcoal, the three of them could not help but laugh.</p><br/><p>Li Xue waved her hands and a couple of clanging sounds could be heard. Following that, she spread out layers of white cloth into the sky and they were actually mysteriously suspended in mid-air. The middle of the room seemed to have been transformed into an independent space surrounded by white cloth.</p><br/><p>Heavenly Silk!</p><br/><p>This was colorless and formless silk that was unbreakable. Apart from the Heavenly Silk, nothing else would be able to achieve such an effect. Ever since Ling Tian handed over the Heavenly Silk to Li Xue in Northern Wei, it was never returned back to him\u2026</p><br/><p>The previous clanging sound was Li Xue using the Soul Severing Needles to pin the Heavenly Silk to the wall.</p><br/><p>By the side, Ling Tian was busily lighting up the charcoal. His method was extremely simple. With the piles of charcoal being piled up across the sides of the room, if he were to light them up slowly one by one, he would definitely exhaust a lot of time and the whole room would definitely be filled with smoke. In an enclosed area like this, it would definitely be enough to choke them all.</p><br/><p>Instead, Ling Tian\u2019s method was to circulate his Divine Shocking Dragon Formula to its peak and convert it into a pure Yang inner qi. He would then be able to light a whole row of charcoal at the same time and the smoke produced would be much less. After walking once around the chamber, Ling Tian had easily lit up the charcoal piles!</p><br/><p>Autumn had just arrived and the weather was still pretty warm. While the mountain was undoubtedly cooler, after a huge pile of charcoal was lit the effect shouldn\u2019t be underestimated. Ling Tian immediately felt as though he was in a sauna. Even a sauna in his previous life wasn\u2019t as warm as this\u2026</p><br/><p>The temperature in the room would definitely rise further as the charcoal burned.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then looked at the cloth that Li Xue had hung up and did not know whether to laugh or cry. In Ling Tian\u2019s eyes, these four layers of cloth were completely unnecessary! Was she trying to cover matters up only to make it worse?</p><br/><p>Is it really necessary? If she didn\u2019t hang the cloth, it would only be the four of them. Even if she hung it up, it would still be the four of them. Besides that, Ling Tian was the key person to purge the Divine Black Negative Meridians and he would definitely have to enter the layers of cloth. Since they would have to face him naked, was there a difference to hang up these layers of cloth?</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian didn\u2019t know that the three ladies naturally had their reasons for hanging up the cloth. At the very least, they would feel differently. If the three of them were to strip in this open chamber, they would feel as though they were out in the wild with danger all around them. While there wouldn\u2019t be a fifth person to enter the chamber, this sense of insecurity would still be in the hearts of these ladies.</p><br/><p>After hanging up the layers of cloth, the three ladies would immediately feel different. It was as though there was a little hut in the middle of the forest. While the number of people was still the same, this small little space would give the three of them a sense of security. In fact, with Ling Tian who was their beloved man present, the three of them would even feel a sense of sweetness and happiness in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Of course, Ling Tian who did not deeply understand the thoughts of the ladies would not understand all of these.</p><br/><p>Currently, young noble Ling was only filled with a ball of lust.</p><br/><p>Under the glow of the fire, the figures of the three ladies in the layers of the cloth could be vaguely seen. It was like looking at a flower in the fog and a layer of mystery was added onto it. Hearing the three ladies chatting behind the cloth together with the embarrassment which they were trying so hard to suppress, while Ling Tian knew that this wasn\u2019t the right time, he just could not help but react to it.</p><br/><p>Looking over, Ling Tian could obviously tell that the three ladies no longer had any clothing on their bodies. They were like three flawless jade pieces being wrapped up in cloth. If he walked nearer and looked through the cloth closely, he could even outline the three beautiful figures of the ladies.</p></div>\n</div>"}

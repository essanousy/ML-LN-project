The heavy atmosphere in the room pressed down onto everyone to the point they felt breathless. As for Ling Tian, his figure drifted up into the air and floated away like a feather. Only after forty feet later did he stand up straight. Following that, a cool breeze melded into the night sky\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at the horizon, the sky was slowly turning bright and the sun was about to rise. The night of hard work didn\u2019t go to waste! He found out what he wanted to know and understood what he needed to understand. As for what he had to prepare, there was still sufficient time!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was rather satisfied with his harvest tonight but also felt a tinge of regret.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s only consideration now was just what kind of benefits Yu LiuShui needed from them. Why would this third young noble be willing to take out the Snow Jade Sky Reversal Pellet in exchange?</p><br/><p>Could there be anything that he could do with regards to this matter?</p><br/><p>Could it be that third young noble Yu wanted to seize the position of the successor? If that\u2019s the case, wouldn\u2019t Above Heavens be aiding the brothers to kill each other? Above Heavens would naturally be willing to aid the third young noble Yu in this matter. However, could Yu ManLou\u2019s son really be so foolish? Could there be something hidden within this matter?</p><br/><p>However, this matter was truly hilarious. Yu ManLou mobilized thousands of people to search for three groups of people. First was himself, the second was Shui QianHuan, and third was these Above Heavens people.</p><br/><p>Currently, Shui QianHuan\u2019s whereabouts were unknown and it seems like it wouldn\u2019t be easy for Yu ManLou to find him. As for the other two groups, he was hiding in the courtyard of Yu ManLou\u2019s second son, and these Above Heavens experts were hiding in the courtyard of Yu ManLou\u2019s third son.</p><br/><p>To think that the people he wanted to find were right in his own home and under his nose!</p><br/><p>This was hilarious to the point it was an irony. Regardless of how wise Yu ManLou was and how flawless his plans were, why would he ever suspect his own son? As for the others, if not for Yu ManLou\u2019s orders, would they be willing to offend these two young masters? Especially during the mourning period of their first young noble?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian almost wanted to lament for Yu ManLou. A man would be the most helpless when he has a degenerate son and an unfaithful wife. While Ling Tian didn\u2019t know whether or not Yu ManLou\u2019s wife was faithful, his son being a degenerate was already proven.</p><br/><p>With a heart full of joy, Ling Tian drifted into the second young noble Yu\u2019s courtyard. At the front of the courtyard, second young noble Yu was still in the embrace of his beauty. How would he be able to guess that the so-called relatives of his beloved lady were actually the very people his father wanted to kill?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are back?\u201d From the darkness, Li Xue drifted out with a trace of wetness in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 aren\u2019t asleep yet?\u201d Ling Tian felt his heart tighten up and also a wave of warmth.</p><br/><p>Li Xue rolled her eyes, \u201cThere are a half-dead fellow and weak miss in the room. With you not being around, how would I dare to go to bed? Are you really going to rely on those little brats whose martial arts aren\u2019t fantastic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian rubbed his nose and let out a bitter laugh. Li Xue was probably the only person who would say that the martial arts of Ling Chi and the rest weren\u2019t fantastic. After all, the five of them were the famed assassins of the First Pavilion! Before Ling Tian could reply, the sound of an opening door could be heard and a few black dressed young teens walked out. They immediately bowed down and greeted Ling Tian, \u201cYoung noble is back.\u201d It was Ling Feng, Ling Yun and the rest. All of their attention was focused on Ling Tian, and they didn\u2019t even glance at Li Xue.</p><br/><p>\u201cErr, why aren\u2019t you guys asleep?\u201d Ling Tian glared.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Young noble isn\u2019t around and brother Jian is injured. We can\u2019t be at ease.\u201d Ling Feng said respectfully, \u201cYoung noble has always taught us to rely on ourselves. Are we really going to rely on a weak lady who we have never seen before to protect us? Wouldn\u2019t we be letting young noble down?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a bitter smile. It seems that Li Xue\u2019s words were heard by them. No wonder Ling Feng\u2019s words were so barbed with a tinge of hatred and enmity. They were obviously extremely dissatisfied with Li Xue abusing Ling Jian. It is just that\u2026 even if you guys are dissatisfied, why do you have to sandwich me in the middle? Weak lady? Just these two words would ensure that Li Xue will not let the matter rest so easily. Just wait, this Miss is not someone that even this young noble can provoke!</p><br/><p>This lass just loved to be at odds with the First Pavilion! It was as though they were natural adversaries! Ling Tian immediately came to that conclusion.</p><br/><p>Li Xue was enraged and was about to blow up! Ling Tian waved his heads helplessly and growled, \u201cWhat is going on? Why are all of you so hot-tempered?! Where are we at right now! What kind of a time is this? You guys still in the mood to be quibbling? You guys have truly disappointed me! We are all considering each other\u2019s safety but have to face each other like enemies! If this happens again, I will not let you guys off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Feng and the rest stood up straight and didn\u2019t dare to move.</p><br/><p>After teaching the few of them a lesson, Ling Tian turned around and reprimanded mercilessly, \u201cGetting angry at a bunch of brats, you are truly capable! This isn\u2019t the first time I told you that all of them are my close brothers. Why don\u2019t you think about your status? Quibbling with my brothers like that, how unruly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ling Tian\u2019s merciless words, Li Xue also had the same reaction as Ling Feng and the rest. She straightened her back and lowered her head like a young child in the wrong. Ling Feng and the rest immediately felt a wave of comfort. No matter how tyrannical this crazy lass is, she still had to be obedient when facing young noble! What are you so fierce about?</p><br/><p>Li Xue knew that this was definitely not the time to rebut Ling Tian. If she were to rebut Ling Tian at this moment and make him lose face, it would be equivalent to killing all of her chances in future. After today, no matter how she tried to make up for it, it would be impossible to please Ling Tian again. After all, a man would want to preserve his face in front of his subordinates. Thus, Li Xue tried her best to act the part of an obedient child and her efforts were undoubtedly effective.</p><br/><p>If there were to be a flaw, it would be the fact that Li Xue\u2019s cheeks were actually a tinge of bright pink. She was feeling shy, at ease and satisfied at the same time. With her intelligence, she naturally understood the true meaning of Ling Tian\u2019s words. Those words of his had a huge amount of meaning hidden within them and to the meticulous heart of a lady, it naturally had a different meaning to it. This made Li Xue\u2019s heart pound hard as her heartbeat raced.</p><br/><p>Ever since they opened up to each other back then, this was the first time, Ling Tian reprimanded her in such a manner! However, the more Ling Tian acted in such a manner, the more it meant that Ling Tian had completely put down the past and accepted her. He wasn\u2019t protecting her like a sister and wasn\u2019t treating her like a normal friend. Instead, he was truly treating her like his woman as he reprimanded her.</p><br/><p>Such a tone was obviously too heavy to be used on a younger sister.</p><br/><p>As for a friend, he would only beat about the bush but not be so direct.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Ling Tian still said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you think about your status?\u201d In the ears of Ling Feng and the rest, it was naturally Ling Tian trying to protect his brothers. However, it was a completely different flavor in Li Xue\u2019s ears. Status? What kind of a status could she have? Was he talking about her status as his wife? The status of a Madam? How unruly? A Madam scolding her husband\u2019s subordinates was truly unruly!</p><br/><p>Thus, despite being reprimanded by Ling Tian, Li Xue was actually overjoyed. She then said with a shy and soft tone, \u201cI, this\u2026 concu\u2026bine\u2026 wouldn\u2019t dare to do that in the future.\u201d Her tone and expression were just like a daughter-in-law who just entered the household.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had just drunk a mouthful of tea which Ling Yun served him and upon hearing this and seeing Li Xue\u2019s expression, knew that she had completely misunderstood him! In shock, Ling Tian spat out the mouth of tea which he had yet to swallow and gave Ling Yun a good face wash. Ling Yun couldn\u2019t help but grumble to himself, Am I really that frightening looking?</p><br/><p>With his finger trembling and pointing at Li Xue, before Ling Tian could say a word, he began coughing incessantly and two streams of tea had actually flowed out of his nose. It could be seen just how hard Ling Tian was coughing and how surprised he was.</p><br/><p>With his almost perfect image in this life, such a behavior was something which Ling Tian had never displayed before. Even Li Xue, Ling Jian and all the people who were close to him in this life had never seen Ling Tian acting like that before!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian entered the room pitifully, and everyone else followed him. Li Xue stomped her feet hatefully and felt disdain towards her own actions as her face burned up. To think that she would call herself his concubine in a moment of rashness! Hmph, you must be dreaming! What was I thinking! She then turned around and dashed back into her room, daydreaming as she sat on her bed.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian supported his figure up and gave Ling Tian a bow. After Ling Tian responded with a \u2018Mmm\u2019, he instructed Ling Jian to lie back down. He then looked towards Ling Feng and the rest and asked, \u201cDid you guys see anything odd on your way here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Feng took a step forward and said, \u201cThere aren\u2019t any oddities but we received a message from Sister Chen. She is asking young noble for your opinion on the feasibility of her plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian asked, \u201cWhat plan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Feng retrieved a wax ball from his embrace carefully and split it into two. After which, a small strip of paper fell out from it.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian received it over and unrolled it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble:</p><br/><p>According to young noble\u2019s instruction, this concubine has taken charge of the Courtyard and understands my responsibilities. When young noble is out alone, may you take good care of your health and place your safety as the number one priority. Everything in the family is well and there isn\u2019t a need for you to worry. This concubine hopes that young noble can come back safely.</p><br/><p>The world is about to be thrown into chaos and all the empires are eyeing on each other covetously. As for our Ling Family, while we have many elites in the courtyard, they have not been through battle and can\u2019t be used to face the upcoming war. The matter of training the soldiers is extremely urgent and can\u2019t be delayed further. If young noble is agreeable, the Courtyard can give the command to the First Pavilion to support the various camps we have in the continent. These camps can attempt to gain control of their respective areas. Not for the sake of ruling over the world but for the sake of training our soldiers to meet our future needs.</p><br/><p>If this plan is successful, when young noble raise the flags of war, all the various camps will be able to raise their flags and rally their support. At that time, they will all be veteran soldiers who have been baptized by the flames of war and will be an indestructible force! Sweeping across the continent and controlling the world wouldn\u2019t be a problem at that time.</p><br/><p>This concubine awaits a speedy reply.</p><br/><p>This concubine Ling Chen looks forward to the day my husband can eliminate Justice and obliterate the Martial Order Medallion, returning safely while shocking the entire world!</p><br/><p>Concubine Ling Chen\u201d</p><br/><p>Below her message was the date which was dated one day ago. Apart from showing her longing for Ling Tian and her new plan, Ling Chen had actually ignored Ling Tian\u2019s previous question completely. Furthermore, she even asked him to get rid of Justice. If Justice was someone so easily taken care of, why would Ling Tian need to escape all over the continent? Apart from feeling warmth in his heart, Ling Tian also didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. It seemed like Ling Chen was extremely resolute about carrying out her previous plan. If not, she wouldn\u2019t have avoided that question in her letter.</p><br/><p>It seems like that lass will insist on carrying out her plan. Ling Tian let out a sigh and shook his head. He really didn\u2019t know where Ling Chen\u2019s confidence was from. Beyond Heavens has been around for a thousand years and has never interfered with the conflict of the secular world. The strength that Beyond Heavens wields is truly not something that they can imagine. With just Ye QingChen and Justice, it can be seen just how unrealistic it would be to obliterate the Martial Order Medallion.</p><br/><p>But apart from dealing with Above Heavens, Ling Chen\u2019s new plan was in line with Ling Tian\u2019s original plan or training is soldiers in battle. This was something that Ling Tian had been planning for a very long while already. Now that the other powers in the continent have almost completed their preparations, it was naturally the right time to carry out this plan. However, Ling Chen being able to notice the importance of this was something which surprised Ling Tian greatly. Ling Chen\u2019s speedy improvement in grasping the overall situation greatly satisfied Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>Holding onto the message in his hands, Ling Tian fell into deep thought. Ling Chen\u2019s speedy growth was something that he didn\u2019t expect at all. However, Ling Jian was currently injured, and Ling Chen alone may not be able to support the situation. If all the various camps were to fall into chaos, the strength of the First Pavilion would be spread out too thinly. Furthermore, a portion of their strength in the Courtyard would also be tied down. At that time, the Courtyard wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with the strength that the Yu Family has left behind in Sky Bearing. Especially the fact that the Courtyard was where Ling Tian\u2019s roots were and he couldn\u2019t afford for anything to go wrong with it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

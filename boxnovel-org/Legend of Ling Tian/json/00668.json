This matter has no business with you, so why must you look for trouble?\u201d He could already feel that the youths in front of him were not people he could provoke, and started to soften the warning tone he had in his voice originally. If not, based on his original habit, he would have long ago drawn his blade and attacked!</p><br/><p>As for the person who had been beaten by the fat man till he looked like a chopstick, he also felt that this bunch were not people that he could provoke, and immediately shrank his head in, not daring to make another sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho am I? Are you even qualified to know?\u201d The youth with a dragon whisker beard laughed, his righteous aura spreading out as he spat, \u201cWhat I want to know is how is it that a bunch of riffraff like you, who don\u2019t know martial arts at all, can be so impressive as to go around bullying people?!\u201d His face darkened suddenly, \u201cI also want to know, just who are you guys? To actually dare to cause trouble in Sky Bearing? To create problems right before the Ling Family establishes their kingdom? Do you guys even have brains?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fat man was startled, before suddenly flaring up and cursing, \u201cWhere did this little bastard come from, to actually be so lawless towards my Xiao Family?! Are you seeking death? Report your name to this daddy now!\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth, however, gave a disdainful smile instead. \u201cXiao Family? Is it the same Xiao Family that is now trapped behind that mountain? You don\u2019t even dare to walk out of your house\u2019s front door, so why are you mentioning your family name? Other than flaunting your authority to the poor commoners who do not have the strength to truss up a chicken, what else can you do? Other than being overbearing and arrogant, rascally from head to toe, just like your group, just like your family, what else can you do?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fat man let out a bellow, \u201cYou little b*stard, this daddy here will rip you apart!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two elders that were positioned between them suddenly raised their voices, \u201cStop!\u201d They turned to face the youth with the dragon whisker beard, a dangerous gaze flashing in their eyes. \u201cMight I inquire as to whom you are? Why would you come out with such slanderous remarks towards my Xiao Family?\u201d</p><br/><p>The youth in question laughed out again, before replying, \u201cSlander? All the facts are placed in front of our eyes, how is that a slander?! Unlike a certain family, which had traversed unhindered from the East to the South, crossing blades so many times with the Xiao Family. This one here is Tian Sixteen from the Heavenly Stem Mountain, you may address me as Brother Sixteen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Behind him, a few of the youths could not help but let out \u2018puchi\u2019 sounds of laughter. Even Ling Jian and Ling Tian were smiling so hard their eyes couldn\u2019t be seen.</p><br/><p>Tian Sixteen, Sweet Pomegranate [1], this person was precisely Brother Pomegranate!</p><br/><p>However, the facial expressions of the two older men sank, as they slowly replied, \u201cSo it turns out, that the famous Tian Sixteen is actually this noble! However, why have you, King Tian, come all the way to Sky Bearing this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Sixteen chuckled, \u201cSince you people from the Above Heavens Sect have come, why can\u2019t I be here as well?! If you guys can come over, why can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re here to congratulate the Ling Family on founding their kingdom? Could it be that the Ling Family has had contacts with you, King Tian?\u201d The eyes of the elderly men were like steel needles.</p><br/><p>Tian Sixteen smirked, before suddenly turning around to sit down as he replied, \u201cWho are you? You\u2019re not worthy for me to explain!\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression of the elder grew more solemn at this point. He sinisterly said, \u201cHeralding from the South East, just like us, King Tian should turn towards our Xiao Family to mutually support and reinforce each other. Having met you for the first time today, this Meng would like to forge a relationship with King Tian.\u201d As he spoke, he stretched out a hand, as though wanting to invite him for a chat.</p><br/><p>Tian Sixteen\u2019s face sank as he responded, \u201cThat goes without saying!\u201d He too stretched out a hand. Since this old fogey had requested a challenge in such an open manner, he could not display any signs of weakness and retreat. Furthermore, he had his brothers behind him, and there was even his House\u2019s young master and the Big Brother present! The moment Tian Sixteen were to display even the slightest bit of weakness, he would not be able to raise his head in front of others in the future! That being said, he did not put this old man in his eyes at all.</p><br/><p>The duo grasped each other\u2019s hands, and in that instant, their bodies shook. As the saying goes, \u2018The truth will appear when a professional puts his hand into it\u2019. Tian Sixteen\u2019s face darkened at the same time the old man\u2019s face turned red. With a shattering sound, the chair Tian Sixteen was sitting on blew up into powder, while he remained in the same seated position.</p><br/><p>Peng! The green tiles below the feet of the old man shattered, flying off in all directions.</p><br/><p>The two people, four eyes in total, stared calmly at each other without even blinking. To think they were completely evenly matched, and on the surface, no one seemed to have the upper hand.</p><br/><p>However, within the old man\u2019s heart, he was astonished beyond belief! His entire lifetime\u2019s worth of cultivation was actually only evenly matched with this youth that had only passed a decade in age!</p><br/><p>After a long time, the old man finally released his hand, and indifferently spoke, \u201cMuch obliged, you\u2019re indeed extraordinary!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Sixteen smiled a little, but quickly returned to his passive look as he replied in a hoarse voice, \u201cAbove Heavens, indeed worthy of the name!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSky Bearing isn\u2019t the South East, you should take note of your words and actions!\u201d Looking deeply at Tian Sixteen, the old man gravely spoke before retreating and waving his hand. \u201cWe\u2019ll make a move first!\u201d They intended to leave right away! The youth before him was already so strong, so those people that were around him could definitely be said to be about the same level! Furthermore, one of the two standing at the side looked suspiciously like Ling Tian, so if they were to really clash, they would definitely lose miserably!</p><br/><p>The moment his words came out, he turned to leave, unwilling to stay a second longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t!\u201d Tian Sixteen\u2019s face changed, as he slapped and table and stood up. However, someone had already beaten him to it!</p><br/><p>A flash of white was seen, and Ling Jian, with an icy expression not unlike that of a ten-thousand-year-old glacier, stood at the door entrance, his entire body exuded ice cold strands. \u201cWant to go just like that? To cause trouble in Sky Bearing, did you ask me before doing so?!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the two parties had collided with their inner qi previous, Tian Sixteen, which was also Ling Sixteen, had eaten a small disadvantage and suffered from slight internal injuries. With Ling Jian\u2019s current accomplishments, how could he not be able to notice it? His heart was currently filled with the flames of anger. Given his personality as someone who was overprotective of his family and brotherhood, how could he take this lying down? Furthermore, the old man had originally aimed towards him and the young noble, and only after Ling Sixteen appeared did the old man\u2019s plan go down the drain.</p><br/><p>While they were now considered outsiders, and could not acknowledge each other, Ling Jian would still let his brother see, that he would always have their back!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the meaning of this, sir?\u201d The old man gazed at Ling Jian as he coldly snapped.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for your identity as the ambassador from the Xiao Family, I would have long ago put you to death under my blade! You might be the ambassador of the Xiao Family, but to be so unbridled here, I\u2019ll have you remember for life what it means to create trouble here in the Smoky Thea Tower!\u201d Ling Jian\u2019s expression was icy, an uncontrollable killing intent flashing within his eyes!</p><br/><p>The group of seven from the Xiao Family immediately felt a chill go through their hearts.</p><br/><p>The icy young girl immediately took a step forward, demanding, \u201cStep aside!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face twitched as he stared at the girl. A weird expression appeared on his face before he suddenly made a move. He crossed past the girl to appear in front of the old man, and in that instant, grabbed onto his hand. The old man could not even dodge. Ling Jian stared at him, slowly saying, \u201cSky Bearing isn\u2019t the South East, you should take note of your words and actions!\u201d The hint of threat was thinly veiled within. Ling Jian actually returned the words the old man had just spoken back towards him, word for word! The meaning behind this was thought-provoking.</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s face turned scarlet, before turning pale as a hint of fear appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian let go of his hand, deeply staring at the girl before he turned back to his seat, no longer looking at them.</p><br/><p>The old man stopped the rest of his entourage from rashly moving, and hoarsely commanded, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d The seven of them proceeded along in a single file. The young lady took the rear, and before she stepped down, she suddenly turned to face Ling Jian, a murderous spirit in her eyes as she questioned, \u201cYour name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian did not even turn to face her, coldly spitting, \u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>A hint of coldness appeared in the young lady\u2019s eyes, and she replied, \u201cThe next time, I\u2019ll definitely kill you!\u201d before walking away.</p><br/><p>Tian Sixteen\u2019s face turned white at this time, and he heaved, spitting out a blob of blood.</p><br/><p>Outside the Smoky Thea Tower, the old man walked for more than twenty feet before suddenly staggering and vomiting out a mouthful of blood. He replied with some lingering fear, \u201cWhat a close shave! Such exquisite and pure strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at this startling change, the expressions of those around were all overwhelmed with shock.</p><br/><p>Having spat out that mouthful of blood earlier, the dejected expression on the old man\u2019s face increased, and he coughed and sighed as he spoke, \u201cThat person\u2019s martial arts are deep and profound, probably even on par with that of our Sect Master! Not only is he fierce and overbearing, but yet experienced. I believe he should be, without question, the top hidden expert under Ling Tian! The reason why our Above Heavens experts that were sent over to Ling Family Courtyard never returned would likely be because of him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fatty sucked in a cold breath of air. To think that he actually wanted to show off his mediocre skills in front of this person who had the ability to cover the skies with one hand! He felt his back slick with cold sweat over the lingering fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, there\u2019s a point that we can confirm. For someone that deserves such a powerful expert to accompany him, that means the white-robed youth that was beside the expert could only be Ling Tian!\u201d The old man\u2019s face seemed to have aged as he continued, \u201cThis time, my injuries are not light, but we definitely had some harvest. However, we have to pause the scheme that the Sect Master has planned for the time being. With just us six, it will not be so easily accomplished.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were a group of seven, yet he only mentioned six. Meanwhile, the young girl, Xiao YouHan remained cold and aloof, as though she did not care, but there were minute fluctuations within her eyes.</p><br/><p>The old man gazed at Xiao YouHan, saying in a bland tone, \u201cYouHan, go take care of Second Master properly. Stick close to him on normal days, to ensure his overall safety. If anything untoward happens to Second Master, you have to communicate with us immediately, so we can take the necessary precautions. After all, we\u2019re in Sky Bearing, and if there are any problems, it is not something we can take responsibility for.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YouHan made a soft sound of assent and did not speak further. Those around her were aware of this little lady\u2019s attitude due to the prolonged period of socializing, and none of them took it to heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, let\u2019s go back for now.\u201d A trace of worry appeared on the old man\u2019s face as he turned to gaze at the Smoky Thea Tower once again. He thought to himself, With such an expert present, will the assassin employed by our Sect Master be able to succeed? If it fails, and the plot falls through, then all of us will probably have to be buried here.</p><br/><p>He sighed deeply.</p><br/><p>Within the Chamber of Elegance inside the Smoky Thea Tower.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was positioned between those seating, and he finally put his right hand down from Ling Sixteen\u2019s back, warmly smiling as he said, \u201cIt should be fine now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Sixteen only felt a wave of comfort surge through his body, the internal injury from before already gone without a trace. He exclaimed in joy, \u201cMany thanks to the young noble. It\u2019s because of me that you have to waste your strength for nothing. I feel really terrified at that thought!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian snorted when he heard that. \u201cTerror? Do you even know how to feel terror?! Those people were obviously aiming at young noble and I to probe us, nothing to do with you at all! Young noble also did not command you to step in, so why did you leap up so forthrightly? Did you think that the two of us would not be able to handle it? To think that you\u2019re still here blasting your mouth off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Sixteen\u2019s tanned face immediately paled, and he started to stutter, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 that\u2019s because I\u2026 actually I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could not help but burst out laughing, shaking his head as he teased, \u201cYou still have your old habits, always stuttering with you\u2019re nervous. Ling Jian, stop bullying him, his internal injuries have just healed. If he really turns into a stutter, then that would be a problem.\u201d Ling Jian continued to stare at Ling Sixteen with an unfriendly look, as he warned, \u201cIf there\u2019s a next time, I\u2019ll pluck out your tongue, not even allowing you to be a stutterer.\u201d Then he laughed, \u201cYoung noble, what relation is there with internal injuries and stuttering?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled in return. \u201cI\u2019m not aware if there\u2019s any relation, but I do know that the moment you revealed your fierce side, Sixteen will immediately stutter. His stuttering means that he is in a nervous state, and being nervous will affect his internal injuries. If his internal injuries are affected, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian immediately started to sweat. \u201cYoung noble, is this a joke?! But since young noble is willing to speak up for this kid, then we\u2019ll let bygones be bygones! Speaking of which, everybody has some blame to take. Since this is in line with the young noble\u2019s intentions, then we\u2019ll not blame anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Sixteen looked as though he had just received a great pardon, immediately agreeing. The rest of the youths present laughed out loud, all crowding around Ling Tian and Ling Jian, unspeakable joy on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are there only a few of you here? Where are the rest?\u201d Ling Jian asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe majority should be still rushing, but big brother Ling One, who\u2019s the furthest has already arrived. I believe they should be preparing some sort of gift, which is why they are late. Right now, getting hands on a congratulatory gift is not easy, the moment you lag behind, there will be nothing left!\u201d A youth laughed out as he commented.</p><br/><p>The moment they started speaking about the congratulatory gifts, everyone let out smiles of exultation. Their words came out to be humble and modest, and no one dared to spill the beans. Obviously, all of them thought that they were well prepared, with all of them appearing extremely confident.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, I just hope that all of you don\u2019t embarrass me, that would be enough.\u201d Ling Jian nodded his head in satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Ling Sixteen started sniggering at this point as he remarked, \u201cBrother Jian, on my way here, I met with the little kid Ling Fifty, and I almost died laughing. That kid actually brought a whole twenty wagons, and his pace was like a tortoise crawling. When I commented on whether he could share a wagon with me, his face turned pale with fright, hahahaha\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian also smiled as he commented, \u201cThat kid is a well-known hoarder. Before he came to the Outer Courtyard, he would even save a small meat bun, tucking it in his bosom until it turned moldy. To think that he actually brought so many wagons this time? Looks like he\u2019s going to be in a world of pain for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever much his heart hurts, it beats being at the last 10 places. After all, he\u2019s the one who experienced Brother Jian\u2019s methods the most.\u201d Ling Sixteen was still smirking, \u201cWhen I mentioned about traveling together with him, he actually was unwilling, as though afraid that I was going to steal his stuff. That look of anxiety on his face, really, tsk tsk\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian burst into laughter. \u201cWho told you to be so extravagant in the past? The allowance that young noble gives all of you every month, you would always be the first to finish spending it, then you would resort to either stealing or snatching, even cajoling. And it was always Fifty who would save every single penny of his allowance as though it was a gold mountain, not willing to spend, only to have a portion taken by you. If we were to rank who he\u2019s most afraid of, it might not be me, but rather you, Sixteen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone burst into a round of laughter, reminiscing about the good times in the past. The way the youths looked at Ling Tian and Ling Jian went up by a few notches in respect.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Ah\u2019Jian, I realized that you were giving that icy beauty some strange looks earlier on,\u201d Ling Tian commented with a smile that was not a smile after sipping a mouthful of tea. A few of them immediately put on an ambiguous expression, while everyone suddenly sat up straight, their gossipy nature raging in full blast.</p><br/><p>Out of everyone\u2019s expectations, Ling Jian actually frowned, as though pondering this question before he replied, \u201cEven if young noble doesn\u2019t talk about it, I would also seek advice from you sooner or later. Your judgment was right; that lady was giving me a very subtle feeling. In addition, the weirdest part about it was that her martial arts were only mediocre, but the moment she spoke about wanting to kill me, I actually felt a palpitation in my heart, and my mirror state of self was even broken. This is something that should not have happened! Just based on her strength, how could she give me a sense of danger? Could it be, that this is the heart demon young noble mentioned before, that I have to cross? I initially thought that Miss Li Xue was the mental demon i had to overcome, but after seeing this scene, I\u2019m certain that this lady is the one!\u201d Ling Jian furrowed his brow as though unable to understand it.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s mouth hung agape, he did not expect this legendary King of Assassins to reply with such an incongruous answer! Wasn\u2019t this making a mountain out of a molehill?! To actually take a lady who locked eyes with him as a danger?! This could probably go down in history as the weirdest conversation, completely nonsensical! To think that he was acclaimed as the master of cold jokes, just look at Ling Jian, now that was a true master!</p><br/><p>\u201cPfft, pfft\u2026\u201d came the stifled laughter from the side. A few of the youths wanted to laugh, but did not dare, and were suffering from trying to hold it in. All of them present had gone through countless tribulations, with much experience to their names, and they naturally understood the theory behind mental demons. To think that the Ling Jian that they dreaded so much could actually display such an adorable side, they could not help but secretly laugh to themselves!</p><br/><p>Throughout the years of his life, Ling Jian was solely focused on the art of killing, researching the way of the sword, never paying attention to anything else. Other than the social activities organized by Ling Tian, he never deigned to take part in any of them. For him, be it a beauty or a hag, they were all just skins covering their skeletons. The moment his sword landed, no matter who they were, all would turn into a corpse. Towards matters of the heart, he never bothered about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 I say, Ah\u2019Jian, since you feel danger, then how are you going to take care of this problem?\u201d Ling Tian asked with a straight face, as though interested in his response.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian frowned in response, muttering, \u201cHow strange.\u201d He shook his head before continuing, \u201cI find it incomprehensible!\u201d And he put on an astringent expression.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was astonished, and pressed on, \u201cWhy so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian seemed to still be deep in thought, replying absentmindedly, \u201cSince I feel danger, then I should definitely remove the problem at the root! However, the moment I roused my own killing intent, in my heart I felt the unwillingness to extinguish this bud! This feeling is extremely strange! Never have I felt this before!\u201d Ling Jian sat there in bitter thought, muttering, \u201cCould it be that this girl has practiced some unfathomable charm technique? To have ensnared me while I was caught unawares? It must be so, else, I would not have felt such danger! Young noble, you\u2019re indeed knowledgeable, this should be the source of my mental demons!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian woodenly fell back into his seat, completely rendered speechless by Ling Jian\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian began to sweat, sweat buckets, sweat out a waterfall\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHAHAHAH\u2026.\u201d Laughter suddenly burst out as though it had been restrained until it could no longer be controlled. Ling Sixteen held onto his stomach with one hand, his tears streaming down his face, while the other smacked the table, smacked his thigh, as he laughed the life out of himself.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was stunned, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny! I just fell into someone\u2019s sinister scheme by accident! The next time I see her, I\u2019ll run her through with a single sword move!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had just come back to his senses and almost suffered from a cultivation deviation from the nonsense that came out of Ling Jian\u2019s mouth. He did not know whether to laugh or cry as he commented, \u201cAh\u2019Jian, that\u2019s not your mental demon! It merely means that your springtime is here! You dumb*ss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian sniggered in reply as he pointed with a finger outside, saying, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to state the obvious, Young noble, I can feel it, as can everyone! Springtime is here! As a matter of fact, the willow tree here is already sprouting leaves.\u201d</p><br/><p>[1]: Tian Sixteen () has the same pronunciation as Sweet Pomegranate ().</p></div>\n</div>"}

Furthermore, since the other party had prepared the bewildering grass, they would definitely have other plans!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately thought about the six Above Heavens experts who followed Xiao FengYang and the three souls and seven bodies of the Yu Family! At that time, they would be seated together with the guests and the moment the burning grass was spread, they would be able to kill a couple of ministers like dicing vegetables! With the scholarly ministers being caught off guard, it was extremely likely for them to be wiped out by the enemy\u2019s experts!</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Ling Tian felt his hands and back turn cold!</p><br/><p>What ferocious means! What a meticulous scheme!</p><br/><p>Seeing the ugly look on Ling Tian\u2019s face, Ling Chi asked carefully, \u201cYoung noble, how should we take care of all this? Do we burn it\u2026 or send it back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBurn it?\u201d Ling Tian sneered, \u201cThis is the huge congratulatory gift that Yu ManLou and Above Heavens have given me. If I don\u2019t keep it well and find a good way to return them the favor, how would I live up to this warehouse full of bewildering grass?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Ling Chi immediately replied and did not dare to say another word.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian paced around for a couple of steps before lifting his head up with coldness in his eyes, \u201cI originally wanted to show some face to the Yu Family during my empire\u2019s founding ceremony. But it seems as though I was too kindhearted! Since Yu ManLou sent his three souls and seven bodies, he obviously treated Sky Bearing as the gates of hell! Since that\u2019s the case, these souls and bodies do not need to return! Ling Jian!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresent!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the empire\u2019s founding ceremony, arrange men to kill the three souls and seven bodies. Not a single one of them shall be allowed to return alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Chi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresent!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill all those from Above Heavens! I want them to be buried in Sky Bearing forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Xue!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresent!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGather our men and prepare them to set off. Inform the south-east information agents to gather news on Above Heavens\u2019 movements. Send a note to Beyond Heavens and invite Justice to aid us under my name. We shall kill everyone from Above Heavens!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Chen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPresent!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInform the Crystal Pavilion branch in Bright Jade City. Carry out my original plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>A series of orders were given out and Ling Tian\u2019s fury subsided a little. However, his face was still dull and his gaze gleamed with coldness! Even a top-notch expert like Ling Jian could not help but tremble slightly from Ling Tian\u2019s pressure!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was truly enraged this time!</p><br/><p>The anger of a man would cause blood to be spilled every five steps. The anger of a monarch would result in a pile of ten thousand corpses and rivers of blood!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian turned around abruptly and stormed away in anger. Li Xue and Ling Chen looked at each other and followed behind him. As for Ling Jian, he stayed behind to overlook the operations. Before the soldiers of the Courtyard took all the captives back, Ling Jian would not leave. All of these loose ends were usually handled by Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian and the two ladies walked quietly. While Ling Jian really wanted to follow behind Ling Tian, he knew that he could not throw down his responsibilities. Ling Jian knew that Ling Tian was truly enraged this time!</p><br/><p>With the monarch\u2019s rage, a mountain of ten thousand corpses would be created and rivers of blood would flow!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s anger would shock the heavens and earth!</p><br/><p>The last time Ling Tian flew into a rage, it was when Ling Xiao was betrayed by Sky Bearing. In a fit of rage, the entire heavens trembled and he weaved through ten thousand enemies with five men. He awed the entire world with a single battle!</p><br/><p>In a fit of rage, he wiped out an empire!</p><br/><p>After knowing Ling Tian for so many years, Ling Jian and Ling Tian were already closer than ordinary biological brothers, master and servant. In fact, in some aspects, Ling Jian was even more familiar with Ling Tian than Ling Tian himself! Under Ling Tian\u2019s influence, Ling Jian had always felt that there wasn\u2019t anyone in the world who couldn\u2019t be killed! Taking revenge only required a single sword!</p><br/><p>Even if everyone in the world died, Ling Jian would not even frown! As long as the people he cared about were still alive, the lives of all others weren\u2019t important!</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Jian did not really understand why Ling Tian was so angry! The way he saw it, it was completely reasonable for Yu ManLou to employ such means. After all, they were enemies with each other and would naturally employ all means necessary. Are you going to expect your enemy to show mercy? If it was him, he may employ even more sinister means!</p><br/><p>Since Yu ManLou\u2019s means were so sinister, we should use even more drastic means to repay him. There wasn\u2019t a need to be angry at all.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Jian didn\u2019t know that Ling Tian was angry because of two words: Divine Prefecture!</p><br/><p>The Divine Prefecture of their Divine Prefecture Empire!</p><br/><p>Because this was the name of his old home! Because that was the name of the Chinese people!</p><br/><p>In this life of his, that was the only reminder of his identity!</p><br/><p>Everything that he had been through in that place, all of his tears, all of his smiles, all of his hopes, and all of his hopelessness! Even if that place was full of bitterness and grief and even if it wasn\u2019t a memorable experience!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian\u2019s soul still contained the brand of his home!</p><br/><p>This name was going to appear for the first time in this foreign world!</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Tian was thoroughly enraged!</p><br/><p>With Ling Tian\u2019s status and strength, there wouldn\u2019t be a single person in the world capable of enduring his rage! Even if that person was Yu ManLou, the Family Head of the number one aristocratic family in the world!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian walked in the front with dark clouds over his face. Despite the bellowing killing intent exploding forth, Ling Tian\u2019s heart was extremely calm. He carefully calculated all of his moves and his future decisions!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou, very good. I originally intended to have a good battle with you with the entire world as our wager. Why do you have to force me as such? Why do you have to use such despicable means time and time again?!</p><br/><p>Since this is the case, I shall return the favor and I hope that you will not regret it!</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and Li Xue followed behind Ling Tian silently as they guessed in their hearts, Just what sort of means did Ling Tian leave behind in Bright Jade City? What kind of arrangements did he make? For him to mention it at this moment, it would definitely deal Yu ManLou a heavy blow! However, that was the territory of Yu ManLou after all and the Yu Family had been running it for a thousand years. Just why was Ling Tian so confident?</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether it was Li Xue who transmigrated together with Ling Tian or Ling Chen who had grown up together with Ling Tian, the two of them could not guess just what kind of arrangements Ling Tian had made!</p><br/><p>The entire Sky Bearing City seemed to have been transformed in a single night with flags of prosperity and joy all over the streets. Lanterns and colored banners were all around the city. Firecrackers and joyful drumming could be heard all around with the streets filled with people.</p><br/><p>On top of the city gates, a gigantic flag fluttered proudly in the wind. It was bright red in color with a golden-colored five-clawed dragon. The dragon was stepping on the clouds with seven stars as its crown. It descended down into the mortal realm with its majesty looking down on all living beings!</p><br/><p>In the city, everyone was dressed in new clothes and the guards on the city gates were also clad in new armor and full of spirit. All the shops in the city were also colored with flags and the streets were all cleaned up. Troops of patrol guards roamed the streets in an orderly fashion with not a single person out of step. Many people in the crowd held onto colored flags as they flooded towards the gates of the Sky Bearing imperial palace.</p><br/><p>Today was the founding day of the Divine Prefecture Empire!</p><br/><p>In a gigantic plaza in front of the imperial palace, there was a large stone platform covered in red cloth. On top of the stone platform were two words carved out from a large slab of rock entrenched into the stone platform, standing up proudly!</p><br/><p>Divine Prefecture!</p><br/><p>Every single word was the size of two ordinary houses with a layer of gold paint over the words. Under the rays of the sun, the golden words shone resplendently!</p><br/><p>The sound of drumming sounded from within the palace and everyone felt as though the drums were like hammers hammering down on their heart. The doors of the palace that had never been opened to outsiders opened up gradually and two rows of imperial army soldiers walked out neatly clad in full armor. At the same time, a bright red carpet that was 90 feet wide was unrolled out from the palace gates.</p><br/><p>The ministers and generals of Sky Bearing formed two rows with their expressions solemn.</p><br/><p>The members of the Ling Family walked in the middle with Old Master Ling Zhan clad in a luxurious set of clothes. His white hair was like silver and his figure was hale and hearty. Behind him, Ling Xiao and Ling Tian followed behind. Before the new emperor ascended to the throne, the three rituals of paying respects to the heaven, earth, and ancestors had to be carried out.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the entire plaza which was filled with tens of thousands of individuals was filled with silence.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had a serious look on his face as he scanned the surroundings with his spiritual sense. While Ling Tian was confident that nothing would go wrong, he still could not help but feel a tinge of unease. After all, nothing was absolute and it was best for him to be prepared.</p><br/><p>The entire Sky Bearing was already like an iron tablet at this moment!</p><br/><p>Amid the large crowd, there would be a Ling Family guard hidden for every dozen individuals. Furthermore, there were even a couple of first-rate experts included in the crowd.</p><br/><p>On the high ground in the surroundings, Ling Tian had arranged for 8000 divine archers to watch the place! The moment someone attempted to create trouble, he would immediately turn into a human porcupine and be reduced to dust!</p><br/><p>Just when everyone was kowtowing to the heavens, Ling Tian could catch a glimpse of Ling Jian\u2019s figure flickering in the crowd. After that, a small commotion would be created and a couple of individuals would be carried away after fainting from the crowd. Ling Tian naturally knew that it was impossible for these individuals to faint from being squeezed by the crowd but it was only Ling Jian attempting to get rid of any suspicious individuals.</p><br/><p>Despite it being the day for national celebration, Ling Jian was still clad in grey robes as he hid in the dark. Perhaps Ling Jian was the busiest person today\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

While I will make relevant arrangements and preparations for my future generations, it is impossible for everything to go my way. Is there anyone in the world capable of truly making an everlasting arrangement for his future generations? Not a single one! There will never be anyone!\u201d Ling Tian said with firmness in his voice, \u201cEven the powerful Yu Family that has the Shui Family as a mortal enemy is only able to survive for a thousand years. Currently, Yu ManLou obviously intends to fight for hegemony for the world and disregard his ancestral teachings! The destruction of the Yu Family will definitely happen in the next few years. Furthermore, the Yu Family is a mere aristocratic family and not the seat of the sovereign!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am only a man and my strength is limited. After all the preparations that I make for my descendants, if they have the strength to protect my territory, then the territory will naturally be protected. If they aren\u2019t able to protect it and the territory gets snatched by others, it will be their own problems. If their descendants are capable, their descendants can very well choose to snatch the territories back! However, that will spark another war for hegemony again! When I am alive, something like that will naturally not happen but I cannot lead an immortal\u2019s life. Even if I have the heart to care about the matters after my death, it is impossible for me to be bothered about it. If that\u2019s the case, I might as well let nature take its course.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rise of the Ling Family is destined with me around. However, a few generations or millenniums later, the fall of the Ling Family is also certain! It is only a matter of time! So what is the point for us to discuss these matters now?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian was talking, the intense battle in the plaza continued and everyone watched nervously. Only Ling Tian and Ling Jian seemed completely uninterested in the battle unfolding before their eyes. While the two of them were standing in the crowd, their eyes were not fixed on the battle at all. It was as though this battle in front of them was not even worth watching!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the war ends and peace is restored to the world, Ah\u2019Jian, do you want to be a general or a duke?\u201d Ling Tian asked with a bright smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the war ends?\u201d Ling Jian rubbed his head and thought about it carefully. However, the more he thought about it, the more lost he felt. That\u2019s right, after young noble unites the entire world, just what should I do?</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I shall still follow young noble. I am the happiest when following young noble.\u201d After thinking for a long while, Ling Jian finally said those words. \u201cI shall do whatever young noble wants me to do. Even if young noble wants me to be your study attendant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Ling Tian almost burst out into loud laughter. If not for the fact that there were too many people surrounding him, Ling Tian would have probably burst out into laughter. \u201cAh\u2019Jian, you are truly too adorable.\u201d</p><br/><p>After having a good laugh, Ling Tian said seriously, \u201cAh\u2019Jian, let\u2019s not talk about the other matters first. However, it is time for your marriage to be determined. No matter what, you have to leave some descendants for your ancestors right? Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you, if you are still alone after the war is over, I will take things into my own hands. I won\u2019t go too far and would give you a dozen or so concubines at the very most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face immediately cramped up as he replied with bitterness, \u201cYoung noble, can\u2019t you give me a few more years? I am not too old anyway and there isn\u2019t a need to rush\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian glared at him and retorted, \u201cGive you a few more years? You aren\u2019t too old? You can say this to anyone except me. In a few years time, my sons and daughters will probably be growing up and I still want to betroth my children to yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was immediately energized as he said, \u201cThen I shall make sure to speed things up. For the princesses of young noble, I have to make sure to give birth to a few more sons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian cursed in response, \u201cNonsense, I will give birth to eight sons. You better give birth to a bunch of ladies to be the daughters-in-law for my sons.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them burst out into laughter together.</p><br/><p>A loud explosion could be heard in the plaza followed by a low grunt. Yu ZhiQing from the Yu Family stumbled a couple of steps back and sat on the ground with his mouth full of blood. As for Shui WuHeng from the Shui Family, he lay lifelessly on the ground.</p><br/><p>Victory and defeat had been determined. One injured and one dead!</p><br/><p>The one who died was naturally completely dead. However, the victor did not have an easy time either. Ling Tian could tell that it would probably be impossible for Yu ZhiQing to use any martial arts for the rest of his life!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the point of this meaningless battle?\u201d Ling Tian lamented with a sigh, \u201cAt the very least, the two families had the two pieces of Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade as a wager for their battle with the victor bringing it back to study for 60 years. But what is the point of battling now? The Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade is already gone and what is the purpose of placing their lives on the line now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade is gone?\u201d Ling Jian was stunned for a moment and asked, \u201cHow does young noble know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cBecause the Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade was destroyed in my hands. They were reduced to two piles of dust and even the benefits within them all belongs to this young noble. I am naturally clearer about it than anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian burst out laughing for a moment before quickly stifling his laughter.</p><br/><p>Another member from each family was sent up and the battle commenced again.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian frowned with a bored expression on his face, \u201cThis so-called generational battle is truly boring. Only the battle between BingYan and QianRou will be a little exciting. Besides that, probably the battle between Shui WuBo and Yu ManLou is worth watching. As for the rest, there really isn\u2019t a point to watching it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian nodded his head in agreement and in a bored tone said, \u201cAfter fighting for such a long time, only a few of them died. Truly a boring fight.\u201d Ling Tian nodded in agreement. His Ah\u2019Jian indeed had the same opinion as him. Furthermore, his opinion was extremely tyrannical!</p><br/><p>The sky became darker and darker with the dark clouds in the sky looking as though they were about to come rumbling down. The air around them became gradually more humid and the wind began to blow. The battles between the two families became more and more bloody and in less than 4 hours, 5 rounds of life and death battle were over.</p><br/><p>The Shui Family won two rounds and lost three with the Yu Family in the lead at the moment. However, Yu ManLou\u2019s face was completely dark and he looked like a volcano on the verge of eruption. Everyone around him could detect his boiling rage. In contrast, Shui ManKong who had lost more experts had a bright smile on his face as though he could not be bothered by his loss.</p><br/><p>This scene made the spectators extremely puzzled. Why was the victor full of anger but the loser still smiling happily?</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou never imagined that their losses would be so huge!</p><br/><p>According to the records of past battles, both the Yu and Shui Families would leave behind a few of their trump cards and only send out a portion of their elites. The wins and losses of both parties would be more or less equal. Only during the few key battles would they fight to the death to determine victory. At times, they would rather admit defeat than allow their experts to put their lives on the line. After all, their thousand years of foundation required someone to guard. If they lost all of their experts in the generational battle, their own territories would probably end up being swallowed by others.</p><br/><p>The battles in the records were completely different from the current situation unfolding before their faces! The actions of the Shui Family were truly too weird! They were sending out all of their elites without any signs of holding back!</p><br/><p>Was the Shui Family not planning to lead their lives after the battle? Were they not afraid of being replaced by other aristocratic families after the battle?</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was truly depressed and felt as though he had missed something. However, he just couldn\u2019t figure out just what he had missed! If the battles continued in such a manner, the losses of the Shui Family would definitely be immense. Of the ten experts that they send out, no more than four would be able to return alive. Even if four of them were able to return alive, the four of them would be no different from cripples! Such a price was something that even the Shui Family that had a thousand years of foundation would not be able to endure. The Shui Family might not be able to recover from such a loss after this battle!</p><br/><p>However\u2026.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou also could not afford to pay such a price! Any one of the ten experts that the Yu Family sent out were top-notch experts and their combined strength was definitely a level higher than the Shui Family experts. However, in a miserable life or death battle as such, no more than three of them would be able to retreat fully! As for the other seven, even if they didn\u2019t die, they would definitely be crippled. Furthermore, the gamble that he had with Ling Tian was right before his eyes. Even with the many years of accumulation of the Yu Family, this loss was something that he was not willing or able to afford!</p><br/><p>For every gold jade level expert that he lost, it would be impossible to groom another one without 20 years at the very least. However, he was only four years away from the final battle that he had set with Ling Tian. That was if Ling Tian did not go back on his word. If Ling Tian felt that his preparations were complete even before the five years and destroys their bet, then the war between them would happen at any moment. If that was the case, their Yu Family would have to face the Ling Family without sufficient manpower!</p><br/><p>Could it be that the Shui Family knew about his battle with the Ling Family and was betting on the fact that he would not dare to go all-out against them? Did the Shui Family think that if they went all-out his Yu Family would not dare to fight them head-on, and so sent out all of their elites?! If that was the case, then how should he deal with this situation? Could it be that the Shui Family truly has an individual with such wisdom and eyesight?! Yu ManLou could not help but fall into deep thought!</p><br/><p>With his face darkened, Yu ManLou looked at the Shui Family who was opposite him. The expressions of Shui ManKong and his cousins were clear to him. Shui ManKong had a carefree look on his face without the slightest bit of anxiousness. Behind Shui ManKong, there were five to six white-robed elders seated peacefully with two rows of young elites beside them.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was suddenly startled and realized something extremely important! Everything was clear to him now. Not a single person from Shui ManKong\u2019s faction had taken part in this battle! Everyone who went out to battle had walked out from behind Shui WuBo.</p><br/><p>This was a fight for authority within the family!</p><br/><p>With Yu ManLou\u2019s wisdom, he immediately understood what was going on. It wasn\u2019t because of the intellect and foresight of the Shui Family\u2019s upper echelons but an internal struggle for power within the Shui Family! While Yu ManLou understood this fact, his teeth were still clenched in anger! He was thoroughly enraged at the situation of the Shui Family. All of you are obviously from the same family, what is the point of fighting among yourselves?! What is there to fight about?! Wouldn\u2019t it be best for everyone to peacefully coexist? Then your Shui Family would be able to ensure your survival and our Yu Family would be able to save our strength. After the generational battle, we would have also fulfilled the wishes of our ancestors. Wouldn\u2019t that be for the best?</p><br/><p>So what if you guys aren\u2019t united? Why do you guys have to fight for authority during the generational battle? Isn\u2019t this as good as trying to dig all of your own graves? The most infuriating thing is the fact that you guys had to drag our Yu Family down!</p><br/><p>For the first time in his life, Yu ManLou was actually furious at the degeneracy of the Shui Family disciples! If all of you cause the fall of the Shui Family because of your actions, how will all of you face your Shui Family ancestors in the afterlife? Yu ManLou almost burst out cursing!</p><br/><p>Go and fight all you want. Just don\u2019t make my Yu Family the stakes of your internal fight! Don\u2019t let this seat lose my men because of your fight! Furthermore, they are all top notch elites!</p><br/><p>You guys just had to break out in a fight right before the battle with my Yu Family!</p><br/><p>D*mmit!</p><br/><p>What kind of degenerate scum is the Shui Family?!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou cursed under his breath furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, what is going on?\u201d Yu ManTang\u2019s keen powers of observation were no less than Yu ManLou and he also realized the oddity of the Shui Family. With a worried look he asked, \u201cBig brother, the situation seems odd. The Shui Family seems to be having an internal conflict. It wouldn\u2019t matter if this was during an ordinary time. But for them to fight at this moment, them going all-out will only lead to us suffering!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s face darkened as he replied in frustration, \u201cThese scums are truly a bunch of b*st*rdly degenerates! A bunch of useless scums! For them to create such chaos in the generational battle, we won\u2019t be merely suffering. It will be difficult for us to endure the loss. For them to have an internal conflict at this moment, aren\u2019t they trying to bury our Yu Family together with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, the situation is already set in stone and we aren\u2019t able to change it. Since that is the case, we should take down the next four rounds swiftly. As long as me, you, third brother, and First Elder are sent out, we can definitely achieve victory and retreat safely. We can then swap out the other five to minimize our loss.\u201d Yu ManTang\u2019s eyes gleamed with wisdom. \u201cAs long as we can conserve our strength, it won\u2019t matter even if we disrupt our original plans! If we allow our original lineup to go up, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, I will face Shui WuBo in the final battle.\u201d Yu ManLou looked at Yu ManTang with a hint of apology, \u201cSecond brother, as for BingYan\u2019s battle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang\u2019s face contorted in agony and he said with a choking voice, \u201cBig brother\u2026 can\u2019t we swap BingYan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s eagle-like eyes gleamed before saying, \u201c\u2026no!\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of extreme anger flashed past Yu ManTang\u2019s eyes before it was quickly retracted. The reason for his suggestion was so that he could save his daughter but he never imagined that Yu ManLou would still stubbornly refuse! At this moment, Yu ManTang was thoroughly disappointed in his big brother!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou watched his second brother\u2019s retreating figure and a strange glow could suddenly be seen in his eyes. He then turned around and ordered, \u201cThird brother, you are up for the next round. Big brother wishes you all the best. However, it is best if you do not harm Shui ManCheng\u2019s life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian was currently looking around in boredom and his eyes immediately glowed with excitement upon hearing those words, \u201cRest assured big brother! Look at how I teach that darn old fool a good lesson.\u201d He then suddenly paused for a moment and asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no why!\u201d Yu ManLou was not in the mood to explain his decisions and he glared at Yu ManTian. \u201cAll you have to do is to follow my orders. You don\u2019t need to ask too many whys!\u201d He then nodded his head and walked towards Ye QingChen.</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng was obviously at odds with Shui ManKong. How could Yu ManLou bear to kill him at this moment? Wouldn\u2019t it be best if the two parties end up fighting and end in mutual destruction? It would save him so much more trouble! But even if he explained this reasoning to Yu ManTian, Yu ManTian probably wouldn\u2019t be able to understand it.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian immediately had a belly full of grievances as he let out a mouthful of spittle and grumbled, \u201cI can\u2019t kill him just because you say so? This daddy can\u2019t even ask you why? This Third Master just wants to get rid of this darned old b*st*rd! So what about it? He actually dares to call himself Third Master as well? He truly doesn\u2019t want to live any longer!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, words from the plaza sounded, \u201cThe warrior from the Yu Family: Yu ManTian. The warrior from the Shui Family: Shui ManCheng.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a loud chuckle, Third Master Yu excitedly walked out. The full beard on his face also exploded out with excitement like his whole head was a porcupine. A loud wave of laughter sounded and Yu ManTian curled his fingers at Shui ManCheng as he said with disdain, \u201cLittle three from the Shui Family, scram out here right now! This Third Master will let the world know that there is a huge difference between this Third Master and little three! Only a heroic figure like this daddy deserves to be called Third Master. As for a despicable scum like you, even calling you little three is a form of praise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Being fully clad in armor, Shui ManCheng was angered to the point he spat out a mouthful of blood, \u201cYu ManTian, I will\u2026\u201d Before he could even finish his words, Third Master Yu charged forward like a bull. His arms were spread wide open and he looked as though he wanted to mutually perish with Shui ManCheng.</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng was startled and quickly dodged. All of a sudden, Yu ManTian\u2019s leg flashed before his eyes.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian knew that someone like Shui ManCheng definitely feared death. Thus, he took the initiative from the very start before mercilessly unleashing his proudest kick.</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng was also a top-notch expert and after settling his heart down, he fought a conservative battle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Master finally has some tricks up his sleeves.\u201d Ling Jian could immediately see through Yu ManTian\u2019s strategy. \u201cSuch a strategy is the best to deal with someone like Shui ManCheng who fears death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ling Tian stroked his chin with interest as he looked at Yu ManTian who was jumping about excitedly in the battlefield, \u201che actually knows how to use strategies in his battle! Tsk tsk, how smart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, his martial arts have made considerable improvements. If we were to judge him according to the ranks of the Yu Family, he would probably be a middle gold jade rank expert.\u201d Ling Jian blinked with a reminiscing look on his face, \u201cThis Third Master Yu is actually a pretty decent person. He has a pretty good relationship with me, Ling Chi, Feng, Yun, Lei, and Dian. Thinking about how we will have to become enemies in the future and even face each other on the battlefield, we truly can\u2019t bear to do so in our hearts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t bear to?\u201d Ling Tian looked at Ling Jian with doubt. He never expected those words to come out from Ling Jian\u2019s mouth and was truly surprised. \u201cSince you can\u2019t bear to, what will you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face contorted with pain and his eyes dimmed. \u201cSince I can\u2019t bear to, the moment I face him on the battlefield, I will definitely kill him first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ling Tian asked expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian replied calmly, \u201cIf I can\u2019t bear to kill him, many of my brothers will end up suffering in his hands and have their lives threatened. So I will have to kill him first.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

You don\u2019t have to worry about this! Besides, our cooperation will not start today, and we still have time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe still have time? Young noble Ling seems to be short on time the most right now!\u201d DongFang JingLei asked doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! In order for the both of us to be at ease, our cooperation should only start after the episode of me being chased by the Martial Order Medallion owner. If I were to die in the hands of Justice, then our cooperation would be void.\u201d Ling Tian said with a fiery glare, \u201cBut if I can survive this tribulation, I will use all of my strength to help you take the position of Family Head and wipe out all resistance. I will make sure that you can rule over the whole Eastern Zhao Imperial Palace without anyone questioning you! At that time, even if the Eastern Zhao Emperor were to say something but not gain your approval, it would be a useless decree!\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei\u2019s eyes began to burn with excitement as his face turned red. \u201cWhat price would I have to pay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you would have to pay a price! How can there be a free lunch in the world? If I were to tell you that you wouldn\u2019t have to pay a price, would you believe me?!\u201d Ling Tian said in a casual tone, \u201cYou have to control the Eastern Zhao army in your hands and if need be cooperate with me. For example, sending your troops southeast or northwest\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d DongFang JingLei took in a breath of cold air as his face turned ashen. \u201cLing Tian, your plan is far too sinister! Do you think that I am a fool? The Yu Family is in the northwest and Xiao Family is in the southeast! Both of their families have the strength to wipe out my DongFang Family completely. Are you treating my DongFang Family as cannon fodder?! Isn\u2019t that as good as asking us to dig our own graves!\u201d DongFang JingLei retorted in rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you will receive so much without paying the appropriate price?\u201d Ling Tian looked at DongFang JingLei coldly. \u201cNot just that, you will have to listen to my orders as well! With the huge ambition of your DongFang Family, it will only be a matter of time before you are destroyed! Even if you were to fail when usurping power, the family would still be controlled by your big brother. Do you think that the many hidden strengths of your family won\u2019t be used? Let me tell you, your outcome would only be more pitiful! If I can support you to become the Family Head, all of these things will become your strength instead! If you do not have all of these chips, why would I even bother forming an alliance with you? Do you think this young noble is too free and has nothing else better to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince all of these things have to be sacrificed eventually, then I will become your shield and ensure that you and your DongFang Family will remain alive! If you do not have my support, all of your sacrifices will be for nothing! Furthermore, even if you are willing to submit to the other powers and back out from the war of hegemony, your Eastern Zhao\u2019s strength would still be a piece of fat meat in the eyes of the other powers. Would the other powers possibly leave such a sharp weapon behind their backs?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sneered, \u201cDo you really naively believe that you can go into hiding with such a powerful force?\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei said hastily, \u201cBut\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut!\u201d Ling Tian interrupted, \u201cIf you help me and I emerge the victor, your DongFang Family will definitely have a share of the pie. Even in the worst-case scenario, I can at the very least ensure that your standing will be no lower than presently and the ruler of a land, as long as all of you do not have a larger ambition. Even if we were to fail in the end, as long as we form a genuine alliance, I can ensure the survival of your DongFang Family! Your roots wouldn\u2019t be wiped out! You should believe that even if others can\u2019t do that, I definitely have the means to make such a promise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s resounding words were something that DongFang JingLei believed! With how Ling Tian was able to summon a dozen powerful men in the battle with Northern Wei, Ling Tian completely had the right to make such a claim and he definitely had the ability to back it up! If he had the ability to hide a whole army, how difficult would it be for him to hide the direct descendants of a family?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can choose not to agree, but you have to remember that you will eventually lose to DongFang JingTian because he is the rightful Family Head of the DongFang Family! Furthermore, he would never keep you alive! If you were him, you wouldn\u2019t be able to sleep peacefully with such a younger brother either! Don\u2019t talk about brotherly ties to me because no one from an aristocratic family has the right to say those two words!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s sharp gaze shot right into DongFang JingLei\u2019s heart and he continued, \u201cYour strength is far from being a match for DongFang JingTian and he is only missing a proper excuse! I believe that your brother is extremely clear on this, and you are even clearer about it! If not, you would not have chosen to roam around the other empires when your brother became suspicious of you. You first hid in Sky Bearing before using chasing me as an excuse to hide here! You wanted to ensure that even if he had the excuse to deal with you, you would be far out of his reach! However, continuously avoiding the battle is not a long-term solution!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at DongFang JingLei with pity and said, \u201cBrother JingLei, if you do not have my help, how are you different from a dog being chased out of its house?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! B*st*rd!\u201d DongFang JingLei jumped up in anger but was forced back by Ling Tian\u2019s sharp gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you not? Hmm?\u201d Ling Tian added on, \u201cDongFang JingLei, why do you have to lie to yourself like that? Taking a step forward would mean riches and authority but taking a step back means an endless hell! Furthermore, you would die in the hands of an incompetent brother and the family that is so important to you! Do you even have to consider this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I need some time to think about it. Give me some time.\u201d DongFang JingLei said with sweat all over his forehead.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian coldly glared at him for a long time in silence, before finally standing up, \u201cDongFang JingLei, you\u2019ve also mentioned just now, I indeed do not have much time! Actually, even if you do not agree to cooperate with me today, I will still not kill you. I personally feel that it would be a more delightful matter to let your brother personally kill you rather than do it myself. Also, I could easily disrupt the affairs of your DongFang Family without even lifting up my pinky finger, hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After this drawn-out laugh, Ling Tian left. Just as he reached the entrance of the tent, he suddenly stopped short and spoke without looking back, \u201cI don\u2019t mind giving you half a year of time, allowing you to slowly contemplate this. I\u2019m not afraid to tell you that this duration is also the time that I\u2019ve bet with the Martial Order Medallion owner, that if he can\u2019t kill me within half a year, then the Martial Order Medallion will immediately be voided! In half a year, I\u2019ll come and look for you again. I hope that by then, you will not disappoint me!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said that, Ling Tian lifted up the folds of the tent and disappeared from DongFang JingLei\u2019s sights. Li Xue then walked slowly towards DongFang JingLei and said with a bright smile, \u201cShould you choose between ruling over the world or having your corpse intact? This is the only chance for your DongFang Family to survive in the future chaos! Second Master DongFang, consider the saying \u2018one must seek fortune from danger\u2019. We are currently being chased by the Martial Order Medallion owner with both the Yu and Xiao Families covetously eyeing us. This is the time when we require aid. If you were to wait for young noble Ling to solve all of these issues, young noble Ling would probably not even spare you a second glance even if you were to prostrate yourself before him!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can adding flowers onto a brocade be compared to sending coal in the winter?\u201d Li Xue said with a smile and an undisguised chill emanating.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can adding flowers onto a brocade be compared to sending coal in the winter?\u201d DongFang JingLei felt his body shake as he heard those words!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn such chaotic times, it is important for a person to understand his own capabilities! If one is able to understand his true abilities and recognize that he doesn\u2019t have the hope to unite the continent, he must submit to another power to ensure his survival.\u201d Li Xue said slowly, \u201cAs for who he should submit to, that is something that requires both judgment and luck! Currently, there are only three parties worthy of your DongFang Family to submit to, the Yu Family, the Xiao Family, and our Ling Family. The Yu Family has a thousand years of foundation and is deeply rooted in the continent. However, with the strength that they wield, would they require an alliance partner like you? Even if you were to join their alliance, they would not place much importance in your DongFang Family for sure! Furthermore, forming an alliance with the Yu Family would also mean that your DongFang Family will have to be cannon fodder when facing the Shui Family! As for the Xiao Family, they are the richest in the continent and have the support of Above Heavens. As for the strength of your DongFang Family, there is no point in me mentioning it. Furthermore, even if you were to join an alliance with them, your personal problem would not be solved. Do you think any of the two families would help you settle the matter with DongFang JingTian?\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei let out a bitter laugh, \u201cBoth the families would probably be more willing to help my brother get rid of me. In fact, they would probably watch us brothers fight it out before forming an alliance with the victor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Li Xue smiled, \u201cAt this point, our Ling Family does not have a reliable alliance partner. Thus, if you are the first and most sincere family to join our alliance, you would definitely be an important individual! However, the moment you miss this opportunity, our young noble will find either the Lei or BeiMing Family. Ah ah ah, your DongFang Family isn\u2019t the only Great Family in the continent after all! At that time, our young noble won\u2019t be too interested in your DongFang Family anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei felt his heart shudder and he said with gratitude, \u201cThank you, Miss, for your reminder. May I know who Miss is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Li Xue said with a dazed look, \u201cI also want to know who I am. Please forgive this little girl for her shallow opinions. I will be taking my leave.\u201d With a swoosh and wind of fragrance, the light blue figure disappeared completely! With DongFang JingLei\u2019s cultivation, he was actually unable to see how this lady disappeared!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

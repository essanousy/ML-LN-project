However, she still glared at Yu ManLou stubbornly without the slightest intention of backing down.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother! Look at your good daughter! Look at how she has turned out! She actually dares to spout such heresy and forget her ancestors!\u201d Yu ManLou roared with his veins all bulging.</p><br/><p>Both Yu ManTang and Yu ManTian looked at each other and what Yu BingYan had said finally sunk in. That\u2019s right, Yu BingYan was already the daughter-in-law of the Ling Family and she wasn\u2019t just the daughter of the Yu Family. Why did the three of them still treat her as an ordinary junior who didn\u2019t know anything?</p><br/><p>In the depths of their heart, the three of them had never accepted the fact that Yu BingYan had married into the Ling Family. It was truly a marriage for political gain without the slightest bit of festive joy. Because of that, the three of them were still stuck in their old thought patterns up until now.</p><br/><p>However, the truth is the truth!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou treated Yu BingYan as a tool to wrestle for power and would naturally not bother about her thoughts. If not for the fact that he needed to make use of Yu BingYan at this moment, he might not even remember that he had a niece! Yu ManTang loved his daughter dearly and regardless if she was the daughter of the Yu Family or daughter-in-law of the Ling Family, she would still be his precious daughter. As for Yu ManTian, he did not even bother thinking about anything at all. Besides, he had a favorable impression of Ling Tian and doted on his niece greatly. Thus, he was actually pretty happy about the marriage. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t think that there was any difference in her status either. Wasn\u2019t his niece still his niece?</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down big brother\u2026 It is best for us to discuss this matter further.\u201d Yu ManTang persuaded. Hugging his daughter in his embrace and looking at the palm mark on her face, he felt his heart aching greatly.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou snorted, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to discuss? To have such a disgraceful daughter, you are better off not having one at all! As the daughter of the Yu Family, she is only thinking about outsiders and still has the cheek to say that she already belongs to another family. Does she still know what shame is?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian could no longer hold his anger in and retorted in dissatisfaction, \u201cBig brother, how are BingYan\u2019s words unreasonable? Didn\u2019t big brother personally give the order to betroth BingYan to Ling Tian? From the moment the agreement was made with the Ling Family, BingYan already belongs to the Ling Family. Is there anything wrong with what BingYan said? During this battle with the Shui Family, we should not have summoned BingYan back at all. Only direct descendants of the family are allowed to participate in the generational battle between both the families and BingYan probably does not have the right to participate any longer. I feel that big brother is in the wrong regarding this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPreposterous!\u201d Yu ManLou was enraged, \u201cDid I not explain to you the reason behind my decision back then? Do you not understand the reason behind my decision?! Do you think that this marriage is valid? How absurd!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t it be valid?\u201d Yu ManTian was angered to the point his face flushed red as he retorted while panting, \u201cBig brother personally gave the order for me to be my niece\u2019s matchmaker. The whole world already knows about this matter! What does big brother mean when you say that this marriage isn\u2019t valid? I would never be able to accept such a matter of going against my word!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian\u2019s spittle flew in all directions as he continued, \u201cWhy do we have to find the daughter-in-law of the Ling Family to participate in the battle between the Yu and Shui Family? Does our Yu Family really not have anyone else? If we do not have anyone else, then since we will be sending someone to their death either way, why don\u2019t we send your new concubine instead? For us to send the daughter-in-law of the Ling Family to her death, aren\u2019t we asking to get cursed by the world?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when he was about to continue, Yu ManLou had already sent his palm flying towards Yu ManTian. With two tight slaps, Yu ManTian staggered back pathetically with a trace of blood flowing down his lips and a look of disbelief on his face, \u201cYou hit me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian burst out like an exploding volcano, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have anything to say if you hit me because of a mistake I made but what did I do wrong?! Am I not speaking the truth?! Even if BingYan is a daughter of the Yu Family, she is still the daughter-in-law of the Ling Family! If you want to send the daughter of your own family to her death, that is completely your choice! But what right do you have to send the daughter-in-law of the Ling Family to her death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat right? Because I am the Family Head of the Yu Family! Because I am Yu ManLou!\u201d Yu ManLou glared at his third brother with fury burning in his eyes and his palms trembling slightly, \u201cI am doing all of this for the family! I am doing all of these for the foundations of the family! What don\u2019t you understand?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian refused to back down and continued scolding, \u201cFor the family? What nice words! You can be despicable just because it is for the family? You can resort to such unscrupulous means just because it is for the family? Then what is the point of the family existing?! Why don\u2019t we just disband the family and go and play soccer?! Your darn mother! F**k your m\u2026\u201d Yu ManTian paused abruptly and covered his mouth with a shocked expression but it was far too late. He immediately regretted his words and cursed his tongue for spouting out the words that it did.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?!\u201d That seemed to have been the spark to ignite Yu ManLou as he pounced forward to deliver a good beating, \u201cContinue scolding! Continue scolding\u2026 continue\u2026 continue\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian\u2019s body flew around the hall like a ball and knowing that he was in the wrong, Yu ManTian did not dare to fight back. He guarded his head with his arms and allowed his brother to hit him as his brother wished. In any case, this wasn\u2019t the first time he was smacked in such a manner already. However, he did not cry out for mercy in the slightest, obviously still filled with anger from before.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother!\u201d Yu ManTang shook his head with a sigh. This was the first time in the past ten years where his big brother was so mad. It seems like his third brother would have to suffer greatly this time. However, Yu ManTang did agree with what Yu ManTian had said before and didn\u2019t agree with the scheme that his big brother had laid. However, he would not say it so openly like his foolish third brother. After all, some things should only be arranged in secret and there wasn\u2019t a point in saying it openly.</p><br/><p>He naturally knew that Yu ManTian was being beaten up because of Yu BingYan. As for Yu ManTian cursing Yu ManLou, all three brothers knew that it wasn\u2019t enough to ignite such terrifying anger from their big brother.</p><br/><p>With a loud bang, Yu ManTian\u2019s burly figure was slammed onto the ground and Yu ManTian was already reduced to a pig head. They were brothers after all and Yu ManLou would never land any killing blows on Yu ManTian. However, Yu ManTian would probably need a good month or two to recover from his injuries.</p><br/><p>\u201cBingYan\u2019s matter shall be concluded as such! There will not be any changes! If anyone has any disagreements, they shall be punished with the crime of treason!\u201d Yu ManLou ordered coldly and flicked his sleeves, ready to take his leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m unresigned!\u201d Yu ManTian stood up with his face completely swollen, \u201cI\u2019m just unresigned! This is obviously a senseless decision, and I will oppose it even if you beat me to my death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMen, throw Third Master into the prison and allow him to sober up! Without my orders, no one shall be allowed to release him!\u201d Yu ManLou kicked Yu ManTian back to the ground before ordering.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Uncle,\u201d Yu BingYan took a step forward and said coldly, \u201cthere isn\u2019t a need for you to waste your effort and reveal such an ugly side. Doesn\u2019t First Uncle just want me to participate in the generational battle? I will just agree to it.\u201d Yu BingYan said with disdain in her voice as though she was trying to say that this would be the last thing that she would do for the Yu Family.</p><br/><p>\u201cBingYan!\u201d \u201cBingYan!\u201d Both Yu ManTang and Yu ManTian cried out together with anxiousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the secret manual of Beyond Heavens from Senior Justice, I may not necessarily die. So what if I really die?!\u201d Yu BingYan controlled the tears in her eyes and said stubbornly.</p><br/><p>A flash could be seen in Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes and he chuckled, \u201cThis is the true daughter of my Yu Family! BingYan, you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me repeat myself. I am no longer a daughter of the Yu Family. Your niece Ling Yu BingYan shall take her leave.\u201d Yu BingYan chose to put the surname of Ling before the surname of Yu. Taking a bow coldly, she pulled onto her father\u2019s sleeves and walked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough\u2026 big brother, I shall take my leave as well. Let me discipline this lass.\u201d Yu ManTang hurriedly gave a bow and followed his daughter out. From afar, the sound of him reprimanding his daughter could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Yu ManTian crawled up from the ground and spat a mouthful of blood out. Trying to open his swollen eyes, he growled fiercely, \u201cThis daddy is still unresigned!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Yu ManLou raised his arm up before letting it fall back down weakly. A lonely expression could then be seen on his face as he waved his hands weakly, \u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Yu ManTian still standing on the spot, he roared, \u201cSCRAM!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian wobbled his way out limping as he cursed under his breath, \u201cI am just unresigned\u2026 even if you beat me to death, I will still be unresigned!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou sent a palm strike to the window frame and kicked the sandalwood chair that Yu ManTian was seated in out of the door. He then let out a long sigh and quietened down.</p><br/><p>\u201cBingYan, have you really thought things through? Your chances of making it out alive in this battle are extremely slim! It is said that Shui QianRou is a rare martial arts talent who made it into the XianTian stage before the age of 20. Even if you received the secret manual of Beyond Heavens, the time is far too short and I am afraid\u2026\u201d In the garden, Yu ManTang looked at his daughter with an unconcealed doting expression. \u201cWhile your name was already listed on the list for the battle, the circumstances of today are different from before. You are already the Young Madam of the Ling Family and you can completely choose to reject going to the battle. As long as you do not want to go, no one will be able to force you if you don\u2019t want to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan lowered her head and walked silently on this familiar path. However, an extremely foreign feeling surfaced in her heart. Hearing her father\u2019s words, Yu BingYan raised her head and shook her head with a smile, \u201cFather, ever since I was young, I was plagued with illness and have already worried both Father and Mother greatly. I am participating in the generational battle of the Yu Family for Father and not for the Yu Family. If I voice my objection, Father would definitely be cast out from the family with everyone gossiping about you behind your back. Father brought me up for 18 years and as your daughter I was unable to repay you with anything. The only thing I can do would be to not put you in a bad spot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan leaned on her father\u2019s figure and chuckled, \u201cThe words that I said in the hall were to intentionally anger First Uncle. I had already made a decision about this matter before coming back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang felt his heart trembling as he said with agitation, \u201cBut Yan\u2019er, you are using your life as the stake to enter a battle that you will almost certainly lose! You cannot afford to make the slightest mistake! Even if you have a miraculous encounter, you may not be able to deal with it. You should reconsider the matter again.\u201d Pausing for a moment, Yu ManTang lowered his voice and said with a resolute tone, \u201cYan\u2019er, a single word from you and even if I have to sacrifice my life, I will immediately send you back to Sky Bearing!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Are you guys the family head of the Shui Family?\u201d Ling Tian began crying out, \u201cStrange, before the family head said anything, so many of you are so eager to jump out. Old fogies, do all of you think that you are superior to your family head? This is the bearing of a thousand-year-old family? This is truly rare. It is truly better to witness all of your bearings rather than hearing about it in the rumors!\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s words were laced with sarcasm.</p><br/><p>These words made the elders who were already dissatisfied with Shui ManKong stir with anger. Their cold eyes were fixed on Ling Tian and they all looked as though they were itching to give Ling Tian a beating. For you to act in such an unbridled fashion in our Shui Family territory, regardless of your background, you are truly going too far!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong flicked his sleeves and stopped the elders from his faction who were about to charge forward to defend Ling Tian. With a smile on his face, he shook his head.</p><br/><p>As such, the scenario in the hall became one of Ling Tian facing Shui ManPing, Shui ManYun, and the others from their faction.</p><br/><p>Despite suffering from the miserable losses of the generational battle, there were still a full 200 experts from their faction! Such a force was one that couldn\u2019t be underestimated regardless of where one was. On the contrary, the number of warriors under Shui ManKong\u2019s command who had the right to join the battle was no more than a hundred! With the huge disparity in their forces, it was obvious that the side branch of the Shui Family had the upper hand. It was no wonder they dared to act in such an unbridled manner when facing their family head! You have to know, the number one expert of the Shui Family was also on their side before his death. Ling Tian could not help but lament in his heart, With the huge disparity between their strengths, it would be a wonder if nothing went wrong!</p><br/><p>\u201cAudacious! Why? Could it be that the few of you dare to surround this young noble?\u201d Ling Tian face was calm as he hollered. Not a trace of fear or anxiousness could be heard in his voice and he sounded like an emperor facing an army of rebel soldiers. His voice was filled with the authority of a powerhouse, as though anyone who defied him would be killed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you think you are? Ling Tian, don\u2019t think that you can flaunt your might in Heavenly Wind just because you are a hegemon in Heavenly Star!\u201d An elder sneered as he looked at Ling Tian, \u201cToday, this old man will teach you a lesson. Even if you are a ferocious tiger, you cannot cross the river!\u201d</p><br/><p>The elder glared at Ling Tian with a menacing gaze and emphasized every word clearly, \u201cThose who attempt to cross the river shall die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who dare to humiliate the Shui Family, die!\u201d Close to 200 hollered in unison and their killing intent exploded forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo all of you really intend to kill me? All of you aren\u2019t joking?\u201d Ling Tian suddenly lifted his head up and smiled gently. Despite his warm and sunny smile, the 200 warriors of the Shui Family felt as though a gust of cold wind blew past them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that you will be able to leave this place alive after humiliating our Shui Family members in the Shui Family?\u201d Shui ManYun laughed sinisterly, \u201cFor the past thousand years, there has never been a single person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a heavy sigh before shaking his head with a tinge of frustration. Shutting his eyes, he said with dissatisfaction, \u201cEven talking with all of you takes so much effort. In the past thousand years, there has never been anyone?!\u201d As he said that, he raised his eyebrows at Ling Jian, \u201cLing Jian, it seems like they truly want to kill us and aren\u2019t kidding. What do you think we should do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we should kill them all first!\u201d A fierce glow could be seen in Ling Jian\u2019s eyes, \u201cThose who dare to harm young noble should have their nine clans executed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 nine clans executed\u2026\u201d Ling Tian could not help but let out a bitter laugh. Didn\u2019t that mean that he should also be executed? \u201cThere isn\u2019t a need to be so cruel. I am in a good mood today. I shall just kill them all and spare their nine clans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger!\u201d Ling Jian turned around while hugging his sword. Stretching out his right hand, five swords were unsheathed in unison but only a single sound could be heard!</p><br/><p>They were the most powerful assassin combination: Feng, Yun, Lei, Dian, and the First Pavilion Head, Ling Jian!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, killing intent erupted forth in the large hall!</p><br/><p>Despite the presence of 200 Shui Family experts, they were actually unable to suppress the incoming killing intent!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not let them have the chance to take action! Charge forward to kill them all! Dismember their bodies into a thousand pieces!\u201d Shui QianHai who had witnessed Ling Jian\u2019s strength before roared out anxiously. However, not a single person listened to his orders. Who would bother about a junior?</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s lips curled up in a cold sneer, \u201cKill!\u201d</p><br/><p>The five assassins launched their attacks together!</p><br/><p>The one who takes action first shall have the advantage! This was the first principle of assassination that Ling Tian constantly reminded them. Especially when noticing that the other party has the intention to attack, they should seize the initiative without the need for seeking permission.</p><br/><p>The first to suffer was naturally the furious Shui ManYun who was standing at the very front.</p><br/><p>Shui ManYun would never believe\u2026 even when he had the absolute numerical advantage, he would actually\u2026</p><br/><p>He saw a sword light flash past his eyes as though there was an expert launching an attack. Just when he was about to unsheathe his sword to block the attack, he felt a cold wind blow past his face. Retreating a few steps back, he felt a sharp pain at his back. Attempting to take a few steps forward to avoid the pain, he felt his whole body being engulfed in pain. Following which, Shui ManYun was horrified to realize that he no longer had his legs. His knees were on the ground and a large bloody hole could be seen in his back.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, all of this was what he felt and not what he saw. As for why he couldn\u2019t see, the reason was extremely simple: his eyes were already reduced to two slits of blood! He was long blind!</p><br/><p>Shui ManYun was completely frightened. While he had the heart to cry out in misery, he realized that he could no longer let out a single sound. His figure collapsed heavily onto the ground as though he was a rotten wooden pole.</p><br/><p>This series of changes was truly too terrifying and swift. He didn\u2019t even have the chance to react!</p><br/><p>Shui ManYun from the Shui Family: Dead!</p><br/><p>With Shui ManYun\u2019s martial arts, even if he wasn\u2019t a match for Yu ManTian, he wouldn\u2019t be too far off. If he was facing Ling Jian head-on in a calm battle, even if he wasn\u2019t a match for Ling Jian, he wouldn\u2019t have lost so quickly and miserably!</p><br/><p>However, when facing the ferocious attack of the First Pavilion Head, he did not even have his sword drawn and his emotions were extremely agitated. He was only thinking about how he could rely on his numbers to take down Ling Tian and his gang. Thus, it wasn\u2019t that surprising for the battle to end in such an outcome.</p><br/><p>At the same time, seven to eight miserable groans could be heard. The group of warriors standing at the very front had also collapsed onto the ground together with Shui ManYun. Not a single one of them was just wounded, because they were all dead!</p><br/><p>The four white-robed individuals who killed these eight individuals did not stop there. They charged straight into the crowd with their swords gleaming. At the same time, four crisp voices sounded, \u201cThose who dare to disrespect young noble shall die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpread out! All of you spread out! Gathering together will only cause all of you to commit fratricide!\u201d a bearded elder roared.</p><br/><p>Shui QianHai\u2019s face was completely pale as he looked around with a horror. With his father killed before his very eyes, the first reaction of this aristocratic young noble wasn\u2019t to take revenge for his father but to pee his pants in fear. However, this was truly a life-saving talisman. Ling Jian, Feng, Yun, Lei, and Dian were utterly disgusted at a coward like him and disdained to kill a coward like him.</p><br/><p>The five of them were like five ferocious tigers roaming freely in a herd of sheep. Wherever they went, clouds of blood would explode and they would only leave behind fatalities without any casualties!</p><br/><p>By the side, Shui ManKong ordered those in his faction to remain calm and watch by the side. If they couldn\u2019t tell that Ling Tian was here to aid Shui ManKong, they truly deserved to have their eyes plucked out.</p><br/><p>Despite them being aware of that, they wouldn\u2019t be so foolish to open their mouths about it. At the same time, while they understood that there was a need for such a cleansing, upon hearing the miserable cries of their fellow family members and witnessing all of their bodies collapsing onto the ground, they could not help but feel their hearts ache.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the exquisite swordplay and profound cultivation of the five assassins shocked every one of them present! The most frightening thing was how the five of them could slaughter their enemies as though they were having a casual meal. In the eyes of these five experts, human life was like cabbages for them to harvest as they wished. All of them had calm expressions on their faces as though it was just an ordinary affair.</p><br/><p>The way these five individuals treated life like ants truly made all of their hair stand up on edge!</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t just natural born assassins! They were cold-blooded butchers!</p><br/><p>\u201cRou\u2019er, are these five individuals the most powerful subordinates under Ling Tian?\u201d Shui ManKong whispered to his daughter, \u201cTheir martial arts are truly exceptional and they are truly top-notch experts. No wonder Ling Tian was able to weave through a million soldier army with the five of them! They are powerful indeed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey can\u2019t be considered the best. While they are top-notch experts in the Ling Family Courtyard, they are not the best. There are still a few more powerful than them. With Ling Tian coming to Heavenly Wind, he would still have to leave a few experts behind to protect the Ling Family Courtyard.\u201d Shui QianRou answered honestly. However, her honest reply had made the eyeballs of the elders by her side almost pop out!</p><br/><p>Any one of these five experts before them would probably have the right to lead a sect and reign over a region of the continent! However, they still weren\u2019t the most powerful experts in the Ling Family Courtyard?! Then just how frightening would the best experts of the Ling Family Courtyard be?</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides that, there are still plenty of experts in the Ling Family Courtyard capable of being a match to these five. The strength that you are witnessing before you isn\u2019t considered much.\u201d Shui QianRou\u2019s words made everyone present take in a deep breath of cold air. These experts still aren\u2019t considered much? There are still plenty of them?? Just how powerful was the Ling Family?!</p><br/><p>Including Shui ManKong, all the Elders of the Shui Family felt short of breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still plenty\u2026?! How many of them are there?\u201d It would be sufficiently frightening even if there were another three or four of such experts.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou frowned and said, \u201cI am not sure exactly how many of such experts there are in the Ling Family. However, I estimate that there should be 14 or 15 of them at least.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFourteen or fifteen?! Wouldn\u2019t that be a force that is a couple of times more powerful than these individuals?!\u201d The tone of the bearded elder had gotten a pitch higher and he took in a deep breath of cold air.</p><br/><p>This was far too shocking!</p><br/><p>Even in the Shui Family, experts of such caliber stood at the very peak of the family! Before the generational battle, there were only three to five such experts in the whole Shui Family! Furthermore, the frosty teen in the lead was definitely at the level of Shui WuBo! Just what kind of strength was that?</p><br/><p>However, there was another 14 or 15 of such experts in Ling Tian\u2019s camp?! Just what kind of strength was the Ling Family hiding?!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t such strength too unfathomable and frightening?</p><br/><p>After the chaos and massacre at the start, the Shui Family was gradually regaining their ground and the battle was no longer as one-sided as before.</p><br/><p>The Shui Family was a thousand-year-old family after all. While they were caught off guard initially and fell into a mess, they quickly stabilized the situation and Ling Jian could no longer massacre his opponents like before. It could be seen from the results of the battle since some who were only wounded were beginning to appear in the Shui Family!</p><br/><p>The five of them fought individually and each of them had already taken the lives of 5 to 6 individuals. However, after the Shui Family stabilized the situation, they gradually began to get into formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cShui ManKong! As the Family Head of the Shui Family, you actually colluded with outsiders to destroy my Shui Family\u2019s foundations! Even the heavens will not be able to tolerate your actions! Even in your death, how will you be able to face your ancestors in death!\u201d Shui ManPing waved his sword and cursed.</p><br/><p>From beginning to the end, Ling Tian\u2019s men had only targeted his faction. As for the experts in Shui ManKong\u2019s faction, not to mention helping them, they did not even let out a single sound. If Shui ManPing still couldn\u2019t tell that something was wrong, he should just bang his dead and die.</p><br/><p>For Shui ManPing to speak up at this moment, it was sufficient to show his confidence. The incoming enemies were already surrounded and regardless of how powerful they were, his faction had already gained the upper hand. At the very most, they would be like beasts trapped in a cage. Now that he saw through Shui ManKong\u2019s scheme, he would be able to seize the position of the family head after settling the chaos!</p><br/><p>Shui ManYun and Shui ManCheng had already died and there wouldn\u2019t be anyone else to fight with him for the position of family head. As long as he could quell the chaos before him, the entire Shui Family would be his to command. Thinking about that, Shui ManPing grew extremely excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at how excited he is. It is truly a wonder for him to be so excited before his death!\u201d Ling Tian shook his head and let out a sigh. All of a sudden, his white robes fluttered and he shot into the battlefield. With a wave of his arms, the seven experts surrounding Ling Feng collapsed onto the ground with blood flowing out of their seven orifices.</p><br/><p>Stretching out his hands, he caught another two individuals before smashing them together in the middle. His figure the drifted back and he appeared beside Ling Yun. Two longswords and one battle saber cleaved down towards him, but with a graceful slide, he easily avoided the danger. Following that, the three individuals who slashed at him were cleaved into six pieces.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the two individuals who were caught by Ling Tian were smashed together and their brains exploded like two watermelons.</p><br/><p>Without turning back, Ling Tian casually crushed an individual\u2019s throat with a casual pinch with his left hand. As for his right hand, his right hand smashed towards the chest, back, and abdomen of the eight experts surrounding Ling Lei.</p><br/><p>With the eight experts collapsing onto the ground, Ling Lei\u2019s sword could only stab into the air because there weren\u2019t any targets left.</p><br/><p>With a brilliant flash, the Heaven Splitter was unsheathed!</p><br/><p>At the place where the members of the Shui Family was the densest, Ling Tian\u2019s figure drifted over and a majestic sword qi enveloped the crowd. With a clanging sound, the Heaven Splitter returned to its sheath. Ling Tian\u2019s body did not touch the ground and spun around in mid-air. Flying out of the crowd, he roared, \u201cKill them all!\u201d</p><br/><p>With this roar of his, pillars of blood shot towards the sky and more than 40 individuals had either their heads chopped off or waist cleaved into two.</p><br/><p>In that single instant, while the others could only see a single flash, Ling Tian unleashed a full forty sword strikes! Not a single sword missed its target and not a single target was attacked twice!</p><br/><p>In just a couple of breaths, there were already more than seventy individuals who had died in his hands! Any one of these individuals were rare experts in the continent but they were actually squashed so easily by Ling Tian like a pile of clay without the slightest ability to fight back!</p><br/><p>The originally crowded hall was almost half emptied in this short few moments!</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Tian unleash his might, Ling Jian was also energized. With a cold demeanor, his longsword was as graceful as the wind and as vicious as a venomous snake. With every sword strike, there would definitely be someone dying under his sword. Ling Feng and the other three assassins immediately felt greatly relieved and they worked together with Ling Jian to unleash their final charge!</p><br/><p>From this moment on, the side branch of the Shui Family no longer had the chance to turn things around!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s figure flashed out of the battlefield and drifted to Shui QianRou\u2019s side. Looking at her eyes filled with sweetness and love, Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cLittle beauty, I didn\u2019t scare you, did I?! Is your husband powerful enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s face immediately turned red and she turned around quickly, \u201cHow shameless, you only know how to praise yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong burst out laughing and said, \u201cHahaha, young noble Ling\u2019s martial arts are naturally unparalleled and he definitely isn\u2019t bragging. The way I see it, even the late First Elder of our Shui Family, Elder Shui WuBo, wouldn\u2019t be a match for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>As these words were said, the few elders by the side nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled slightly and looked at them, \u201cI only know a few tricks for self-defense. How do I deserve such praises from Elders?\u201d He then looked towards Ling Jian and the others in battle with a mysterious smile.</p><br/><p>The faces of everyone present turned red together!</p></div>\n</div>"}

The things that Ling Tian had pointed out had struck him at his weakest points. Ling Tian\u2019s words were undeniably extremely nasty to his ears and Yu ManLou almost passed out from anger after hearing them. He was angered to the point his body trembled and steam could be seen coming out from his head. However, he didn\u2019t have any words to retort what Ling Tian had just said!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou had always placed all of his efforts into fighting for hegemony in the world. However, he had never thought about the problem of how many years he would be able to rule over the world after gaining hegemony of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you only want to become an Emperor, that isn\u2019t impossible at the moment.\u201d Ling Tian said slowly and in a heartless manner. He then lifted up his finger and pointed at Yu ManLou before pointing at himself. \u201cBoth of us can definitely do so right now! We can ascend to the throne anytime we wish and become the ruler of an Empire. Even at this moment, we are no different from being the rulers of our respective empires! However, is being the ruler of a small Empire sufficient to satisfy our appetites?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat we want and what we are chasing after is to rule over the whole world!\u201d Ling Tian said with resolution, \u201cAt the very least, we must rule over the Heavenly Star Continent!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThus, I wanted to wait for you here today to have a conversation with you.\u201d Ling Tian gave an amiable smile that looked extremely crafty but yet adorable.</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall accept this conversation of yours.\u201d Yu ManLou said slowly with a tinge of fatigue, \u201cCan you finally say what you truly want?\u201d After his initial anger, Yu ManLou had begun considering what Ling Tian had said with deep contemplation. While Ling Tian\u2019s words were extremely nasty, Yu ManLou had no choice but to admit that Ling Tian\u2019s words made a great deal of sense. Thus, Yu ManLou suppressed the anger in his heart so that he could also learn something from Ling Tian\u2019s words. So far, the things that he had heard were not something that he was interested in.</p><br/><p>However, the more this was the case, the more Yu ManLou was wary towards Ling Tian. Currently, Yu ManLou couldn\u2019t help but feel a tinge of fear towards this teen in front of him! That\u2019s right, fear! Such a feeling made Yu ManLou extremely frustrated in his heart! Apart from that one person from many years ago, he had never felt fear towards anyone else!</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore we begin talking, let me give you a piece of advice.\u201d Ling Tian said with a cunning smile. From the start until now, his negotiation with Yu ManLou had been pretty successful. Now, it was the time for him to give Yu ManLou a condition that he wouldn\u2019t be able to resist. Ling Tian was certain that there wasn\u2019t a reason for Yu ManLou to reject his condition. Since his goal had already been reached, Ling Tian was no longer anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat advice? Do you think any advice would be able to move me?\u201d Yu ManLou looked extremely fatigued but his eyes were filled with malevolence and his tone had also turned soft. At this moment, Yu ManLou looked no different from a fatigued old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cI recommend that you quickly find a few more wives and have them give birth to a son for you.\u201d Ling Tian said with seriousness, \u201cI heard that your eldest son had passed on already and as for your two remaining sons, I have previously met both of them. In all honesty, they are truly bad cement that can\u2019t hold up a wall and dog meat that can\u2019t be served at a banquet. I think that every time you think about how the world that you will reign over in future will be ruined by them, you will lose all of your motivation. Furthermore, if you don\u2019t make any plans now, in just a few years it will be too late to do so. At that time, even if you have the heart to do so, you will no longer have the ability to do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled after saying in a straightforward manner. In this world, he was probably the only person who would dare to talk to Yu ManLou as such without fearing Yu ManLou\u2019s anger. Thus, Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but be filled with delight as he looked at Yu ManLou with a look of satisfaction, looking forward to the exasperated look on Yu ManLou\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Asking the Family Head of the number one Family to take in a concubine! Only Ling Tian would have the guts to say such crazy words! However, Ling Tian only had the chance to let out two laughs before being unable to continue laughing.</p><br/><p>Not only did Yu ManLou in front of him not have any anger, instead he looked as though he was seriously considering the matter with a look of temptation! At the same time, he even revealed a slight smile\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k! I was only making a casual remark\u2026 you can\u2019t be truly tempted right?\u201d Ling Tian pointed at Yu ManLou with a look of incredulity, \u201cYou are actually not angry?? I was asking you to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t your words the truth? Why is there a need for me to be angry?\u201d Yu ManLou suddenly raised his head, \u201cCould it be that if I were to blow my top at this moment, both of my sons will be enlightened? Would they be able to become like you?\u201d Yu ManLou said calmly, \u201cAs for your advice, it is truly a good one and I will consider the matter. After all, I have to consider the matter while I am still able.\u201d Yu ManLou nodded his head, \u201cTruly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the\u2026<em>*</em>*\u201d Ling Tian was completely speechless, \u201cAn old cow like you is really going to go and eat young grass? Are you not afraid of the world poking fun at your backbone? Are you not afraid\u2026 my goodness!\u201d Ling Tian was completely speechless.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou said calmly, \u201cNot only do I accept your advice, I have to thank you for it! This advice of yours is truly great. Even if I have the world in my hand, I can\u2019t stop a degenerate son from losing it in a single night in a bet! I have been thinking about this matter for a very long time already, and after last night\u2019s affair, even you have witnessed how my sons aren\u2019t worthy of inheriting my accomplishments!\u201d A cold light glowed in Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes, \u201cThis is their nature and it is impossible to change them. Thus, I can accept this advice of yours, and I have a good twenty years to groom an outstanding successor! Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian slapped his forehead and was completely speechless. He even had the urge to slap his own lips for their ridiculous words!</p><br/><p>The negotiation between the both of them was already going his way and he wanted to have some fun by teasing Yu ManLou. However, he never imagined that he would dig a hole for himself, and a casual word of advice actually gave Yu ManLou a huge hint!</p><br/><p>The matter that happened last night had undoubtedly given Yu ManLou an extremely huge blow. Especially when he compared Ling Tian\u2019s excellence to his sons\u2019 worthlessness, Yu ManLou couldn\u2019t help but be filled with a strong sense of defeat. It wouldn\u2019t matter if they were profligates in the past. However, they had actually attempted to kill each other and resorted to unscrupulous means! This was something that Yu ManLou was unable to accept. When he had first heard Ling Tian\u2019s advice, Yu ManLou almost erupted with rage. However, as Ling Tian\u2019s words grew nastier, Yu ManLou also felt that they made more and more sense.</p><br/><p>I have yet to turn fifty and I still have the heart and strength to fight for hegemony and groom a new successor!</p><br/><p>Looking at Ling Tian, Yu ManLou smiled, \u201cTo ensure that the thousand-year-old heritage of the Yu Family can shine in this old man\u2019s hands and be handed down to the future generations, so what if I become the laughingstock of the world?! Could it be that the world would curse me less if I don\u2019t do this matter? Furthermore, as long as a man has the heart and the strength, why can\u2019t I find a wife and have some children?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian rolled his eyes and said weakly, \u201cGiving birth to a son isn\u2019t the main point. The main point is that you will have to groom him properly! If you end up grooming another profligate son, it would be better for you to not give birth to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis conversation with you today is truly a wonderful affair. I have truly gained some wonderful advice.\u201d Yu ManLou agreed with a bright smile, \u201cThis old man agrees that the greatest mistake in my life was to not discipline those few brats properly. If I have more children in the future, I will definitely not make the same mistake.\u201d He then looked at Ling Tian with a smile, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that, I will definitely take care of the matter properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>What am I worried about? F**k! Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but grow depressed and had the urge to bang his head on the wall. What did I just say? Did I give him good advice?! Is he the fool or am I the fool?!</p><br/><p>Although he was thinking that in his heart, Ling Tian also couldn\u2019t help but feel admiration towards Yu ManLou! In the world, how many of the leading figures would be able to listen to someone else\u2019s advice with such humility? Even though he was obviously trying to play Yu ManLou as a fool, Yu ManLou was still able to recognize his flaw and admit it! Furthermore, he was admitting his flaws to his biggest enemy!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s breadth of mind made Ling Tian\u2019s heart turn chilly. In Ling Tian\u2019s heart, Yu ManLou\u2019s position was also being constantly altered.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou looked at Ling Tian with a cold gaze, \u201cWhat else do you want to say? Why not let the cat out of the bag? I don\u2019t believe that you only have this single advice right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian revealed a smile of admiration and also adjusted his emotions before saying, \u201cThe battle between the Yu and Shui Family is starting in less than two and a half years right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou smiled, \u201cThis is something that the whole world knows. Is there anything special about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian said in a low voice, \u201cMy deal with Justice only lasts for half a year and the deal is almost half done. If I die unluckily in the hands of Justice, then you can just ignore all of my words. But if I am lucky enough to be alive, I hope to have a deal with Family Head Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat deal?\u201d Yu ManLou could already guess what Ling Tian was about to say and revealed a trace of interest.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled, \u201cI believe that Family Head Yu wouldn\u2019t be willing to spend years or even decades to fight wars over the continent right? This advice of mine would be to reduce the time it takes for us to capture the continent to ten years or less!\u201d Ling Tian threw out his bait.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t afraid that Yu ManLou wouldn\u2019t take the bait! He was less than twenty and had plenty of time to wait and waste. However, Yu ManLou didn\u2019t have that time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s your plan?\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s gaze turned sharp.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian raised five fingers and waved them around, \u201cFive years! For the next five years, I will not find trouble with you and you are not to seek trouble with me either. Both of us, one north and one south or one east and one west, will split the continent into two. Half of it will go to me, and the other half will go to you. At that time, both of our families will face each other in an all-out war and the continent will belong to the victor. As for who should be in charge of which half, you can be the one to decide that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled, and rivers of blood could be seen in his eyes. \u201cHowever, if any party isn\u2019t able to complete their end of the deal, they will have to admit defeat and submit to the victor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s words were as though they were two kids having a little bet. If you win, this glass ball will belong to you. If you lose, this glass ball will belong to me. It was that simple.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

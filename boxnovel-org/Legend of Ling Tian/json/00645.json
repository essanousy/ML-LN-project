Even when the silver light had disappeared completely into his mouth, Ling Tian still held the jade piece at his mouth and squeezed with all his might. After making sure that there was nothing left within the jade piece, Ling Tian put it down with regret.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo delectable! This is truly too delectable!\u201d young noble Ling muttered under his breath with his eyes in a daze. He then looked around at the surrounding rock wall with greed in his eyes. If I could drink eight or ten bottles of this thing, how delightful would it be\u2026</p><br/><p>Just as he was trapped in his fantasy, Ling Tian suddenly felt a rumbling burning feeling coming from his stomach. The immense medicinal effect began running rampant in Ling Tian\u2019s meridians and his suave face was immediately flushed red. The bones on Ling Tian\u2019s body also began cracking and the golden crown on his head was shattered. An endless pain assaulted Ling Tian like it was the boundless ocean and Ling Tian\u2019s consciousness was almost swallowed.</p><br/><p>Before Ling Tian could even think about resisting the pain, he passed out from the immense medicinal might. With a crash, his body collapsed onto the ground!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s body began glowing with radiance before quickly dimming back down. The immense medicinal effect had already begun circulating itself and devastated all of Ling Tian\u2019s meridians. When the impenetrable inner qi of the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula met with this flood of medicinal effect, it was like the remnants of snow meeting with the scorching sun. It was disintegrated and dissolved in an instant\u2026</p><br/><p>In his state of unconsciousness, Ling Tian\u2019s body rolled around in pain and the muscles all over his body could be seen swelling up. The veins and arteries in his body could also be seen clearly through his skin as though they were about to break out of his body. The pores on his body began opening up and a thin black substance began oozing out of Ling Tian\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s body temperature began increasing and his skin grew redder and redder. The flow of blood in his arteries also sped up rapidly and it could be seen with the human eye! White gas began emanating from Ling Tian\u2019s body and the gas grew thicker and thicker until a white fog covered the whole stone chamber\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was not a stranger to having his body being remodeled by spiritual herbs and treasures. Regardless of whether it was the Great Cyclic Pellet or the Flood Dragon\u2019s inner pellet, or even the Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade remodeling the inside of his body. However, all of the previous remodeling operations were completely incomparable to this one. The pain from this remodeling was also a completely different story!</p><br/><p>Even with Ling Tian\u2019s ability to bear with pain that transcends life and death, he actually passed out a few times from the pain! He was knocked unconscious by the pain and then awoken again by the pain, with this cycle repeating over and over again. Ling Tian could not remember how many times he had passed out and even his peerless divine cultivation method, the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula, was completely unable to put up any fight in the face of this powerful heat!</p><br/><p>However, the situation this time was completely different than with the Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade. The last time, his whole body was covered in blood but the bulk of the energy had been absorbed by Ling Tian\u2019s body. While the excess energy entirely ravaged the surface of Ling Tian\u2019s body, his innards were unharmed. If not, even with Justice\u2019s mystical medicinal skills, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to help Ling Tian recover to his peak state in a mere five to seven days!</p><br/><p>If the previous remodeling was like cutting open his skin to clean his bones, then the pain of this remodeling was like dicing his body into a thousand pieces. This was definitely no exaggeration!</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Ling Tian spent most of the time in a state of unconsciousness. Even if he woke up, he would quickly fall unconscious again. If not, even with Ling Tian\u2019s nerves of steel, it would be impossible for him to endure such immense pain. In truth, it would probably be impossible for any living human to endure such immense pain. Even if Ling Tian was only conscious for a short moment, he had already felt a pain akin to descending down the eighteen levels of hell!</p><br/><p>How could the spiritual milk which was formed from the essence of heaven and earth be something ordinary? When the owner of the stone chamber found it, it was already nearing its maturation. Now, more than three thousand years had gone by and it meant that this spiritual milk had absorbed a full 13,000 years of spiritual energy from the heavens and the earth! Even if Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts were at a high level and his cultivation profound, just how many years had he been cultivating for? For this immense energy to not cause his body to explode on the spot, it was already the biggest fortune!</p><br/><p>In the face of such immense energy, even if the number one expert in the world Justice swallowed it, he would definitely be reduced to dust. Of course, with Justice\u2019s mystical medicinal skills, it was impossible for him to take such a huge risk like Ling Tian. He would definitely have a more appropriate and proper method to consume it. He might even be able to refine it into a large batch of spiritual elixirs and would definitely not waste it like Ling Tian! Ling Tian\u2019s cultivation was naturally incomparable to Justice and he also did not have the medicinal skills of Justice. However, he had something that Justice did not have, and that was luck! Ling Tian had too many advantageous conditions that allowed him to escape from exploding into smithereens!</p><br/><p>First, Ling Tian had experienced the cleansing of walking through the Yellow Springs road. Being a character of two lifetimes, Ling Tian had truly seen through life and death and his soul of two lifetimes was far stronger than that of any other individual. Second, Ling Tian had consumed plenty of spiritual herbs in his life to raise his cultivation. He had consumed the Great Cyclic Pellet which was refined by countless heavenly treasures in the world and had also absorbed the essence of the Flood Dragon\u2019s inner pellet. These two divine treasures were also a type of spiritual qi from the heavens and earth and his body was said to be acclimatized to it.</p><br/><p>The most important point was that Ling Tian\u2019s meridians were once remodeled by the Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade, the two jade pieces that were personally crafted by Jun ZhanTian. How would Jun ZhanTian possibly do something completely pointless? Ling Tian\u2019s meridians had already been expanded to the point they could endure the spiritual milk.</p><br/><p>Of course, Jun ZhanTian didn\u2019t think that the spiritual milk would only be found after 3000 years and he overlooked 3000 years of pure spiritual qi. Ling Tian would not be able to escape from the excess spiritual qi and his death should have been certain. However, Ling Tian was truly too lucky and he had coincidentally consumed another herb that had been alive for thousands of years, the King Solomon\u2019s seal.</p><br/><p>While the King Solomon\u2019s seal also had a potent medicinal effect, it was gentle in nature and was not like the violent spiritual milk. At the same time, it strengthened the already expanded meridians and made Ling Tian\u2019s meridians become more flexible, allowing his meridians to have the room from improvement above their limits. With this series of coincidences, Ling Tian was able to barely endure the frightening energy and gain a huge benefit!</p><br/><p>It can\u2019t be said that Ling Tian was kind of lucky, but it was more accurate to say that he was lucky to the point his fate could be changed!</p><br/><p>Every single fortuitous encounter that he had was considered a heavenly blessing. Furthermore, it was only the combination of these factors that allowed him to barely digest the spiritual milk. However, Ling Tian was actually able to meet with all of these fortuitous encounters\u2026</p><br/><p>The white fog on Ling Tian\u2019s body became thicker and thicker and the originally bloody smell from the impurities excreted from Ling Tian\u2019s body had disappeared. Instead, a sweet fragrance filled the room.</p><br/><p>In the cave, the white fog was dense to the point that you would not be able to see your five fingers if they were held in front of your face. Ling Tian\u2019s body was like a fog-producing machine and he continued to spew out an endless amount of fog. The pain on Ling Tian\u2019s face gradually faded away and the contorted expression on his face also eased up. However, he still did not wake up and remained silently asleep.</p><br/><p>If Justice was present, he would probably give Ling Tian a good beating. Such a large amount of ancient spiritual energy was wasted in such a manner by Ling Tian! If this spiritual energy was used in the right way, the benefits from it would be unimaginable!</p><br/><p>Time passed by slowly and the white fog surrounding Ling Tian\u2019s body stopped moving. It gathered around the surface of Ling Tian\u2019s skin and seemed to form a gigantic cocoon, glimmering brightly with a rose gold color\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian who was currently unconscious would naturally be unaware about this. At this moment, the Heavenly Wind Continent was already thrown into complete chaos.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou brought his forces to Heavenly Wind with absolute confidence in his victory. His only target was the Shui Family and to help his biggest rival, Ling Tian, create enmity with the thousand-year-old family, Water of Heavenly Wind. As long as he could destroy both Ling Tian and the Shui Family, the world would be within his grasp. Who would have thought that trouble would find him as soon as he departed from the boat? The frustration in his heart could be easily imagined.</p><br/><p>The Shui Family would naturally be filled with enmity towards the Yu Family. However, what was with the HuangFu and Song Families, being filled with enmity towards him without any reason?! This enraged Yu ManLou badly! In the depths of his heart, Yu ManLou felt that he didn\u2019t need to be afraid of the three families with the forces that he brought. However, this wasn\u2019t any ordinary time and his biggest enemy was Ling Tian with a large bet between them! How would Yu ManLou be willing to waste his strength at this moment?</p><br/><p>While the Yu Family certainly had the strength to wipe out the Song and HuangFu Families, he would definitely need to pay a huge price to do that. Together with the appointed battle with the Shui Family, almost all of the experts that he brought to Heavenly Wind would probably be wiped out with only a few remaining. While he would still be able to escape back to Heavenly Star, he would only have a few weaklings by his side. At that time, what would he use to compete with Ling Tian? That wouldn\u2019t be considered a war but one-sided abuse!</p><br/><p>Thus, even if Yu ManLou didn\u2019t want to, he could only suppress the anger in his heart. He had to first assist the two families in finding out the truth.</p><br/><p>As for how he should unearth the truth, the method was extremely simple. As long as he could find the Sky Alliance, everything would be solved. As such, in the few days before the appointed battle with the Shui Family, the four families launched an operation targeted at the Sky Alliance. While the Shui and Yu Families did not send out their elites to save strength for the upcoming battle, the Song and HuangFu Families felt confident because of the support from both the Yu and Shui Families. They did not hold anything back and sent out all of their elites to sweep through the continent.</p><br/><p>After searching the continent for a few days, they were only able to capture a few little pawns and all the hall masters of the Sky Alliance seemed to have disappeared. They were completely unable to capture even an expert of the Sky Alliance, not to mention the mysterious heads of the Sky Alliance.</p><br/><p>While the operation did not attain its desired effect, it created another effect, that of enraging the Sky Alliance. The Sky Alliance used the most bloody of methods to began their retaliation. Both the HuangFu and Song Families received a bloody gift of a human head! They were naturally heads from the hostages in the hands of the Sky Alliance. Both families received a head each but the Sky Alliance was able to send the heads without leaving behind the slightest trace. These heads not only brought pain and grief to the two families but also incited panic and chaos.</p><br/><p>However, this wasn\u2019t the end but only the beginning. Within a day, the businesses of the HuangFu and Song Families had suffered from a destructive blow. A couple of black-robed burly men sprouted out from who knows where and destroyed all of these businesses that the upper echelons of the two families did not pay attention to. They first robbed the place before setting the whole place on fire and disappearing without a trace. When the two families arrived to investigate the matter afterward, they could not even find a single trace.</p><br/><p>If it was only a single shop or business, it would naturally be negligible. However, the problem was that every shop within a thousand miles was robbed and burned at almost the same time. With thousands of shops being destroyed, it naturally struck a huge blow to the two families.</p><br/><p>The Sky Alliance had only spared the shops in the Jade River City where the members of the two families were mostly gathered. Apart from Jade River City, not a single shop was spared!</p><br/><p>Facing this cruel outcome, both the family heads were devastated. They also did not dare to arrogantly capture the members of the Sky Alliance and it could be said that they decided to come to a compromise.</p><br/><p>All of these were within the expectations of the Shui Family Head, Shui ManKong. When they tried to deal with the Sky Alliance back then, they had suffered such retaliation as well but the situation back then was not as miserable as the situation now. Even with the Shui Family\u2019s thousand years of foundation, they would not dare to provoke the Sky Alliance. The HuangFu and Song Families thought too highly of their own strengths and thought that they could provoke the Sky Alliance with the backing of the Yu and Shui Families. As such, they would naturally have to pay the price for frustrating the Sky Alliance. Furthermore, Shui ManKong was certain that the matter had not come to an end yet.</p><br/><p>Indeed!</p><br/><p>After a day of silence and when the two families were considering how they should contact the Sky Alliance to negotiate with them, the experts of both families in Jade River City met with trouble. Three elders of the HuangFu Family were assassinated and the Song Family also had three of their experts killed.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, all of this happened in Jade River City where they all thought nothing could go wrong! Not only was the arrogance of the two families completely extinguished, but it was also akin to a tight slap to the faces of Yu ManLou and Shui ManKong. Both of them had agreed that the Sky Alliance would not dare to make a move in Jade River City. However, who would have thought that they would be greeted with six bloody corpses after they said those words?</p><br/><p>This was a blatant provocation!</p><br/><p>When the two largest family heads in the world were enraged, the originally arrogant HuangFu and Song Family Heads went silent from fear. The cruel methods of the Sky Alliance had truly scared the two families and the two families were no longer worried about whether or not their children and wives could return alive but whether or not their families would be wiped out!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong wasn\u2019t too enraged as he was clear with the Sky Alliance\u2019s forceful methods. However, Yu ManLou was angered beyond reason. He was far too used to having everything go his way in Heavenly Star but everything had been going against him ever since he stepped onto Heavenly Wind. How could he not be mad?</p><br/><p>Of course, the HuangFu and Song Families no longer suspected Yu ManLou any further. With things developing to such an extent, as long as they weren\u2019t fools, they would be able to tell how ridiculous their original conjecture was. Not only did they offend the Yu Family for no reason, the danger that they felt from the Sky Alliance was also more and more severe.</p><br/><p>However, both HuangFu YanHan and Song TianQiao did not have the mood to think about the outcome of offending the Yu Family at the moment. After all, that would only happen in the future and the Yu Family would not deal with them until after the battle or conquering the world. The party who they should be the most worried about was the Sky Alliance. They were the biggest danger that the two families were about to face.</p><br/><p>The past few days, the two of them could tell whether it was the Shui or Yu Family, the two families weren\u2019t interested in their affairs at all. While the two family heads appeared incensed and enraged, there was nothing more to their rage. As long as the Sky Alliance did not provoke their families, Shui ManKong and Yu ManLou would never take the initiative to touch the Sky Alliance. After all, both of them would never allow the other party to have the chance to take advantage of the situation. As such, the HuangFu and Song Families knew that it was impossible to hope for aid from the Yu or Shui Families.</p><br/><p>The two of them only wished that they could negotiate with the Sky Alliance at this moment! That\u2019s right, negotiate. The two of them had even come to a decision that as long as the conditions of the Sky Alliance weren\u2019t too much, they would just clench their teeth and accept them.</p><br/><p>Today, the sun was hung up in the sky without a single cloud in the surrounding hundred miles. However, both HuangFu YanHan and Song TianQiao felt a bleakness and chill in their hearts.</p><br/><p>It was only three days away from the appointed battle between the Shui and Yu Family. The two hidden sects in Heavenly Wind and Heavenly Star, Outside Heavens and Beyond Heavens, had also sent their representatives to Jade River City. The representatives were then received by the members of the Shui Family into the castle at the middle peak of Mount Vacant.</p><br/><p>The number one expert of the Shui Family, Shui WuBo had also finished his seclusion and walked out.</p><br/><p>Almost all the peak experts of both the continents were gathered here at this moment! Whenever two individuals crossed gazes, as long as they weren\u2019t from the same power, they would definitely be filled with battle intent. Even when they were facing the members of the two hidden sects, the members from the two families would also be eager to give them a try.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the place became extremely nervous as the days passed. A hidden killing intent seemed to have risen and formed a bloody cloud above the castle of the Shui Family.</p><br/><p>Three days later, the generational battle was about to begin. Apart from the representatives from the two hidden sects, there would be many who would end up in an eternal slumber.</p><br/><p>No one wanted to be the one to fall!</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan and Song TianQiao brought their experts and arrived with their thick skin. They were both worried that if they remained on the outside, their heads may end up being claimed by someone without them knowing! They were truly too frightened!</p></div>\n</div>"}

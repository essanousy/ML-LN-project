Every table and stool, every grass or wood would all have Ling Tian\u2019s traces on them. When Jiao Yue slept at night, she would even use the blanket that Ling Tian had covered himself with and there would be Ling Tian\u2019s lingering manly aura on the blanket. Every night, Jiao Yue would even shyly feel that she was sharing the same bed with her beloved husband. Thus, every time it was night and before she fell asleep, even if she was alone in the room, Jiao Yue would be filled with embarrassment whenever she took off her clothes\u2026</p><br/><p>It was late into the night but Jiao Yue was still muttering under her breath. Her eyes were in a dreamy state and her face was slightly pinkish. On top of the desk, the candle would occasionally flicker in the wind. Finally, Jiao Yue let out a yawn and stretched lazily. Standing up she turned around with a gentle motion and looking at the blanket on top of the bed, her face turned red and she said softly, \u201cLittle brother Tian, your elder sister is going to hug you to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside the window, Ling Tian felt his heart shake. When he was still about three or four, he would frequently stay the night at the palace and Jiao Yue would frequently stay in the Ling Residence. Every time, she had to hug Ling Tian until he went to sleep, otherwise he would start whining and sobbing. At the same time, the Ling Family was also happy to let the two of them stay together so they did not need to make a separate sleeping arrangement.</p><br/><p>Before they slept, Jiao Yue would have a victory smile on her face as she said, \u201cLittle brother Tian, your elder sister is going to hug you to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, Ling Tian naturally did not know whether to laugh or cry. With the soul of a twenty-year-old man, he was held by a little girl to go to sleep. But after more than ten years, hearing these same words shook Ling Tian\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Looking at Jiao Yue undressing before she got into bed, Ling Tian sighed in his heart and turned his head around with his heart in a complete mess. Just what should he do? If he didn\u2019t want her, Jiao Yue would definitely be ruined for life. But if he accepted her\u2026 Ling Tian didn\u2019t feel that it was appropriate in his heart. After all, Ling Tian was the one who personally caused Long Xiang\u2019s craziness. This was the enmity of him destroying her father\u2026</p><br/><p>He first made her father crazy before taking over all of his territory and then would carry his daughter into the nuptial chamber? Ling Tian could not help but curse himself for being evil! Just what was this?! He could not help but give a spit of disgust.</p><br/><p>From the room, Jiao Yue\u2019s flustered voice could suddenly be heard, \u201cWho? Who\u2019s outside? Is it little brother Tian who is back?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was startled. Afraid that he would be spotted if she came out, he quickly sprinted away.</p><br/><p>With a creaking sound, Jiao Yue\u2019s maid walked out warily with a lantern. After looking around and seeing that there wasn\u2019t anyone in the surroundings, she eased the door closed. What Ling Tian did not know was that this wasn\u2019t the first time that Jiao Yue was overly suspicious. How would Jiao Yue who didn\u2019t know a thing about martial arts be able to spot Ling Tian\u2019s light movements? It was no more than a coincidence!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then tiptoed his way to his mother\u2019s door. The room was still lit and the sound of pages flipping could be heard. It seemed like his mother was still looking through the accounts. But what kind of accounts would require his mother to look through them late at night?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian knocked onto the door with doubts in his heart. From inside, Chu Ting\u2019er\u2019s voice filled with alertness could be heard, \u201cWho\u2019s outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian replied softly, \u201cMother, it is me. Tian\u2019er is back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The room fell into silence. After almost half a year, she finally heard her son\u2019s voice. In a state of extreme ecstasy, Chu Ting\u2019er had actually gone into a daze. After a moment later, Ling Tian heard the sounds of flurried footsteps followed by the door being swung open violently. Just when Ling Tian was about to walk into the room, his ear was twisted by his mother\u2019s jade hand and he felt two dull kicks on his behind. \u201cYou little b*st*rd! How can you run away without letting me know! You left for a few months and did not even bother sending me any news! You\u2026 you are going to anger me to death! You little b*st*rd, I will smack you until a flower blooms from your ass!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian did not dare to struggle as he cried out in pain, \u201cMother\u2026 siiii\u2026 not so hard\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still know what pain is?!\u201d Chu Ting\u2019er used even more strength and tears suddenly rolled down from her cheeks. \u201cYou little b*st*rd! You ran away without saying a thing and were chased by the number one expert in the world. Do you know how worried your mother was? I couldn\u2019t even get a good nights sleep! You you\u2026 you unfilial little beast! When will you be able to let me worry less?\u201d She then could not help but smack Ling Tian on the behind another two more times. However, she did not use the slightest bit on strength this time and Ling Tian even wondered if the dust on his behind was swept off or not.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian pretended that it hurt badly and pleaded for mercy.</p><br/><p>A long while later, Chu Ting\u2019er finally calmed down and carefully inspected her son. After going out for a full four months, her son did not turn tan or skinny but his skin was instead glowing and he seemed to have grown taller. She was then at ease as she wept tears of joy.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Tian was like an obedient baby, sitting on the spot upright and allowing his mother to check whatever she wanted. He was naturally not afraid of his mother realizing anything. After his previous transformation, his body was fitter than before and his skin was silky to the point a lady would be envious of it. Even all of the scars on his body had disappeared and he was like a hard-boiled egg with its shell being peeled off. Even if Chu Ting\u2019er had microscopic vision, she wouldn\u2019t be able to find anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you being chased? Why does it seem like you were out for a makeover? You were actually chased to the point you became beautiful?\u201d Chu Ting\u2019er looked at her son with doubt. She heard that the one chasing after Ling Tian was the number one expert in the world. But why did it seem as though her son was in an even better state than being at home?</p><br/><p>\u201cMother, don\u2019t worry. The martial arts of that fellow weren\u2019t up to mark and this child went out for a spin with him like I was playing with a child.\u201d Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t dare to let her mother know how frightening that Justice was lest she would be worried about him. He then said cheekily, \u201cHowever, this child is already a grown man and you used the wrong adjectives. You should be describing me as suave and elegant, bold and vigorous. Don\u2019t ever say that I am beautiful again\u2026 err\u2026 mother, you are the one becoming more and more beautiful. If the two of us were to walk on the streets, the others would definitely think that you are my younger sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlib tongue! You dare to joke with your mother like this?! You truly have guts!\u201d Chu Ting\u2019er laughingly reprimanded Ling Tian, \u201cWhy did you return at such a time? Couldn\u2019t you wait until the sun is up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian said with a bitter expression, \u201cThe problem is that I do not want others to know that I am back. This is a military plan. Hehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er glared at her son with both doting and anger in her eyes, \u201cThen you should let your grandfather and grandmother know that you are back at the very least. Do you know how much they miss you? In the few months that you were gone, your grandmother\u2019s hair has almost all turned white. You heartless brat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian hurriedly promised, \u201cOf course. I will go and pay my respects to grandmother after this.\u201d The two of them then began to chat for a short while. While Chu Ting\u2019er could not bear to let Ling Tian go, she also knew that he needed to pay his respects to Old Madam Ling. Now that her son was back home, the worry in her heart was finally gone and she felt a wave of tiredness.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then helped his mother to the bed gently and before he left, Chu Ting\u2019er said with a sigh, \u201cWhen you have time, go and visit your aunt and Jiao Yue. Your aunt is also worried about you. However, she has not fully recovered from her grief and is currently pregnant. You must watch your words when you visit her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian hurriedly agreed and after a short hesitation, Chu Ting\u2019er said, \u201cTian\u2019er, regardless of what enmity exists between both our families, everything is over already. Our Ling Family was not harmed in the slightest and Long Xiang\u2026 as the mastermind of the whole affair, he already received the punishment he deserved. The Long Family will no longer have the chance to fight for power again. It is best for you to show mercy at times and you should consider the matter carefully\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was completely puzzled and asked, \u201cMother, what are you talking about? After talking in such a big circle, I still don\u2019t understand what you are trying to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>She glared at her son with anger and said, \u201cI am referring to your cousin, Jiao Yue. I watched her grow up and understand her personality very well. On top of that, she is infatuated with you and she is also your fiancee in name. If you can, I hope that you will treat her better! Do not have any prejudice against her because of that b*st*rd emperor.\u201d These few months, Chu Ting\u2019er could naturally see how much Jiao Yue missed Ling Tian. No matter what, Jiao Yue was someone who Chu Ting\u2019er watched grow up. Now that Ling Tian was back, she had to remind him about it.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian rubbed his head and said with frustration, \u201cMother, I remember that you have always been opposed to polygamy. Why do you wish for your son to have more wives now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense! Preventing polygamy is your father\u2019s treatment!\u201d Chu Ting\u2019er flared up, \u201cAs for my son, as long as you can handle it, your mother will find the silver for you even if you want to have ten thousand wives!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian broke out in a sweat!</p><br/><p>It turns out that her standards would change depending on the person! His mother\u2019s ferocity made Ling Tian pity his father in his heart. <em>How pitiful!</em></p><br/><p>Just when Ling Tian was about to go out, Chu Ting\u2019er suddenly thought about something and whispered mysteriously into his ears, \u201cThat lass Jiao Yue isn\u2019t too bad. Not only is she beautiful, she has large breasts and wide hips. She will definitely be a good candidate to bear children.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>When he returned to the Ling Family Courtyard, it was already past midnight. His experience from a single night made Ling Tian stimulated, attacked, harmed, trampled\u2026</p><br/><p>His red ears were naturally the doing of his mother. The few canes that he suffered on the behind was naturally by Old Madam Ling. As for the few bumps on his head, it was naturally his grandfather\u2019s way of doting on him\u2026</p><br/><p>As he sprinted back to the courtyard, Ling Tian sighed along the way. <em>There isn\u2019t much time left. This young noble still intends to talk about life goals with Ling Chen. My grandparents and parents are all getting eager to hug a grandson\u2026</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

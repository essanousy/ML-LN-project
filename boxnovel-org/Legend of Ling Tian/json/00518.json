While Ling Tian\u2019s movements were extraordinary in the past, they had not reached such a level! Looking in the direction that Ling Tian left, complex feelings appeared on his face. He suddenly felt as though he had boarded a pirate ship, unable to get off right now. Was today\u2019s choice really correct?</p><br/><p>However, since he had already boarded the pirate ship, he might as well prepare to \u2018dance with the pirates\u2019!</p><br/><p>The sky slowly darkened, as the crescent moon shaped like a hook slowly appeared in the sky. The stars hidden in the vast sky also began to shine brightly.</p><br/><p>In the dark night.</p><br/><p>Garbed in black traveling clothes with a black mask on his face, Ling Tian only revealed his bright eyes as he crouched on a branch, appearing as though he was invisible to the world.</p><br/><p>Below the tree where he stood was a huge courtyard that spanned so far one could not see the end. This was the famous courtyard of the DongFang Family, its fame not losing out to the Yu Family! This was indeed the power of the aristocratic families, not something that the past Yang Family or the Ling Family could compare to!</p><br/><p>This tree was also the biggest one that grew within the DongFang territory. It was unknown how long the tree had been growing, but it was at least a hundred feet tall, with a circumference so huge that seven to eight people linking hands could not cover it. On the tree one could even see scars left behind by lightning strikes, signaling its extraordinary life and tenacity. While Ling Tian stood on the tree, tiny snakes casually crawled around every now and then.</p><br/><p>Tonight, this tree would witness yet another heaven shaking event!</p><br/><p>Tonight was definitely going to be sleepless!</p><br/><p>The Family Head, DongFang JingTian, lived at a particular residence about seventy to eighty feet away from this tree.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had been standing in this particular tree for at least four hours. Before the sky turned dark he had already arrived at this location. As for Xiao YanXue, she was already arranged to stay in one of the inns that was in a safe location.</p><br/><p>Till now, Ling Tian had not seen DongFang JingTian enter or exit his residence, and he could determine that the latter had not even popped by this area at all.</p><br/><p>Having received another boost to his cultivation and strength, Ling Tian did not require much concentration to control his breathing at this point, naturally melding into one with the tree. The black figure on the tree seemed to have transformed into a light breeze, without form or quality, and yet still remaining solidly present.</p><br/><p>The breeze is omnipresent. Wind does not exist not because you do not feel it, but because you\u2019re not in the position to feel it brushing against you!</p><br/><p>Right now, an eighty-foot circumference around the tree had turned into Ling Tian\u2019s domain! So long as DongFang JingTian appeared within the eighty feet of this space, he would immediately suffer the full wrath of Ling Tian\u2019s attack!</p><br/><p>DongFang JingTian would definitely die!</p><br/><p>DongFang JingTian, the Family Head of the DongFang aristocratic family. Aged 53, with slender eyes, hawk nose, thin lips. Lean in size, about six foot tall, weighing eighty kilograms. Does not engage in casual conversations or laugh, does not show any expressions on his face. Mole on face and hair growing on it.</p><br/><p>Martial skills: The family heirloom of the DongFang aristocratic family\u2019s art, the World Defying Hidden Dragon Manual. It is rumored that he has achieved the sixth layer of the skill, allowing him to stop a rampaging bull with one hand outside Eastern Sun City. Furthermore, years ago, he crossed hands with Yu ManTian, being one of the rare few who managed to defeat him. He has a malicious nature, vicious, good at strategies, very cautious.</p><br/><p>Indulgence: Loves to drink black strong tea. Not lustful, extremely restricted bedroom activities. Modus operandi: Loves to torture his enemies before killing them, never making swift kills. Loves wearing green, his life is extremely regimented and organized. He has stuck to the same schedule of waking and sleeping for decades, a person of strong will and determination.</p><br/><p>Others: No heir, does not get along well with his wife for reasons unknown. However, his wife once commented that it would be better to be a widow than to have married DongFang JingTian.</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian closed his eyes, all the snippets of information about DongFang JingTian slowly surfaced in his mind. Regarding his opponent, Ling Tian did not dare to underestimate him in the slightest. Even with the new advancement in his cultivation, giving him immeasurable confidence, he did not dare underestimate this person who used the strength of a single hand to stop the rampage of a mad bull! Furthermore, he had also beaten Yu ManTian who was in the small success stage of the XianTian realm! Just these two points made him a worthy opponent. Yu ManTian\u2019s martial cultivation was already considered close to the apex in this world, even above that of Ling Jian\u2019s. However, DongFang JingTian was still able to beat him. This spoke volumes of his own abilities!</p><br/><p>This was a person with a cruel as well as an absolutely old-fashioned character! It was no wonder that he could not get along with his wife! For a woman to live her entire life with such a person, it would no doubt be an extremely painful thing to do. Ling Tian even had a tinge of pity for JingTian\u2019s wife. As such, Ling Tian wanted to help her! Since being a widow would be happier than being married to DongFang JingTian, then Ling Tian would fulfill her wish, and make her a happy woman every day!</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Tian would rescue this middle-aged woman from her shackles.</p><br/><p>How altruistic can I get? Ling Tian was thoroughly touched by his own act of justice, of a knight saving a damsel in distress, accompanying her on her journey\u2026 Upon reaching this point, Ling Tian almost fell off the tree because of his urge to puke\u2026 This was a very weird way of thinking, unconstrained in style. He was indeed worthy of someone who had lived across two worlds!</p><br/><p>To have crossed worlds and lifetimes, to recreate everything of his from scratch, gave Ling Tian a sense of strangeness. As the wind caressed his exposed skin on this still and calm night, Ling Tian suddenly felt a rush of familiarity. This was his world.</p><br/><p>A world that completely belonged to him!</p><br/><p>From afar came sounds of conversation, followed by three silhouettes walking over. The middle person was a little stooped, as though immensely tired. He possessed a skinny figure, snow white hair, slender eyebrows and hawk nose, a vicious expression and a mole on his face\u2026</p><br/><p>DongFang JingTian!!</p><br/><p>Beside him were two bodyguards dressed in blue, following slightly behind him just like shadows.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was slightly in disbelief. Could it be that even when returning to his own residence to sleep, he would bring his guards? Weird people really have weird ways of doing things!</p><br/><p>The three of them slowly walked, closer to the ancient tree, closer to the residence! Also\u2026 closer to their deaths\u2026</p><br/><p>The night breeze suddenly picked up speed, the whistling of the wind sounding from all directions and bringing with it a hint of cold. As though they had the intention to break the silence of the night, countless leaves on the trees began to rustle and detach, spinning and spiraling as they flew around in the air, just like a man who had finished all his work for the day!</p><br/><p>Autumn has already come, hasn\u2019t it? DongFang JingTian has also arrived, so let his life be akin to those fluttering leaves in the breeze, dead and spiraling away!</p><br/><p>As such, as DongFang JingTian stepped on the falling leaves, stepped on the moonlight on the ground, he was unknowingly sounding the drumbeats to his death. He slowly walked into the small residence, his snow-white hair, that stooped body all indicated that this head of DongFang Family was like a withering leaf on a tree, that would fall off at any time when the wind blew\u2026</p><br/><p>Just as one of the guards pushed open the gate to the residence, a gust of autumn wind came along, aiding the opening of the gate. The cold wind ruthlessly blew at DongFang JingTian\u2019s face, causing him to narrow his eyes. Those tawny colored pupils resembled that of the yellow in autumn\u2026</p><br/><p>The next moment, without any warning, the atmosphere and air around the entire residence were suddenly sucked in as though they had entered in a black hole! The two people together with DongFang JingTian suddenly felt as though the starry sky had turned into a dull and drab area!</p><br/><p>The exact color of death!</p><br/><p>A ghostly shadow, at this time, flashed like a black ray of light as it went down from the great tree to DongFang JingTian\u2019s side in the blink of an eye, appearing almost instantly in front of them!</p><br/><p>At this point, that strange figure, quick to the point of being mysterious appeared, flooding the residence with a biting cold killing intent as he landed there. Before the shadow landed, DongFang JingLei actually did not feel even half a bit of difference!</p><br/><p>What sort of speed was this?!</p><br/><p>Was this even achievable by humans?! Or to be rephrased, was this the speed a peak assassin could reach?!</p><br/><p>Even as DongFang JingTian was in shock, the sword light had already reached his chest!</p><br/><p>Having immersed himself in years of martial arts, DongFang JingTian did not even panic the slightest in his heart, his sensitive skills immediately coming into play as he twisted his body, knowing that he could not move to either side, providing himself a window of time to decide his next move.</p><br/><p>After all, the Ling Tian now could not be compared to the Ling Tian of the past. Even comparing his past and present lives, how many could actually avoid Ling Tian\u2019s perfectly timed assassination?!</p><br/><p>Or we should say, some might be able to escape, but DongFang JingTian was not one of them!</p><br/><p>Pu!</p><br/><p>Blood splashed, but it did not seem as though Ling Tian\u2019s well-planned strike had succeeded. There was a deep wound left on DongFang JingTian\u2019s chest where even the bones were showing, and such was the speed of the cut that the blood did not even have time to fill the open wound. Then there was the distinct flash of bone-white color in his chest, which was filled quickly with blood, spurting out quickly!</p><br/><p>While it wasn\u2019t life threatening, this sort of wound would not be taken lightly!</p><br/><p>Peng!</p><br/><p>While DongFang JingTian reacted quickly and prevented himself from being pierced through the heart, he did not manage to fully escape Ling Tian\u2019s blow! He was heavily wounded and had no chance to escape any longer, suffering from a strong blow from Ling Tian towards his shoulder. A teeth-clenching pain sounded, with his right shoulder almost shattering from the blow! Fresh blood spurted non-stop!</p><br/><p>The imposing head of a family actually could not even withstand a blow from Ling Tian! While the latter had the advantage of a sneak attack, if news about this injury spread outside it would be enough to raise eyebrows in the world!</p><br/><p>DongFang JingTian had no time to check on his wounds for now. His long experience told him that if he did not escape right now, he would be the next one to die! With a low shout he brought with him a spray of blood as he threw himself backward, and before his bodyguard could react, he had already been thrown forward as a meat shield for DongFang JingTian!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

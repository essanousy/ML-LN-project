These strong looking branches were suddenly as soft as tofu and broke apart without much force applied to them.</p><br/><p>Being caught off guard, these top-notch experts weren\u2019t any different from ordinary people. With their balance lost, they all pitifully collapsed back onto the ground. The inner qi that they used to dodge the arrows had already been expended and they fell back onto the ground without a chance to catch their breaths. All of these experts who were usually haughty and arrogant were now falling onto the ground like pancakes.</p><br/><p>The Ling Family warriors who were already prepared let out another volley of arrows and the sharp arrows sliced through the night sky like they were locusts! The sound of arrows piercing through human bodies could be heard all around and countless miserable and desperate groans sounded through the forest!</p><br/><p>Despite the experts of Above Heavens being skilled in martial arts, at least half of them were wiped out by the rain of arrows! Of those left alive, every one of them were riddled with injuries and the arrows that they usually disdained were now the cry of the death god!</p><br/><p>The instant the branch snapped, Meng RuoYun knew that the situation was dire. Without a second of hesitation, he used his vitality and decades of inner qi to spit out a faint red gas. At the risk of internal injury, his figure shot up almost ten feet into the air despite not having a platform to propel himself up. After landing unsteadily on a tree as though he had avoided this calamity, a powerful sword qi came roaring towards him from above. The powerful gust of wind brought about by the sword qi made his whole body turn cold.</p><br/><p><em>An expert! A powerful expert!</em></p><br/><p><em>Dangerous! Extremely dangerous!</em></p><br/><p>Meng RuoYun did not have the chance to even catch his breath. He hurriedly jumped off the tree and before he found a place to land, he could already feel the cold sword blade touching his skin. Exhausting even more inner qi, Meng RuoYun avoided the attack and jumped sideways three times. However, the ambushing expert did not let go of him and followed closely behind him like a venomous snake.</p><br/><p>Meng RuoYun, who was one of the three great experts in Above Heavens, was actually chased to the point he did not even have a chance to turn around! With an enraged roar, Meng RuoYun\u2019s figure shot forward like an arrow and he was finally able to get away from his opponent\u2019s bone-piercing inner qi. However, Meng RuoYun still did not have the time to catch his breath. The first thing he did was to turn around and spit out a mouthful of blood which had a semi-liquid gaseous substance mixed within it.</p><br/><p>In order to get away from his opponent\u2019s pursuit, Meng RuoYun had already burnt his life essence and despite looking as though he was alright on the surface, his internal organs were already heavily injured and he would not be able to fight for long. The semi-liquid red substance was completely different from the faint red gas previously. While the latter harmed his vitality, as long as he nursed his vitality back carefully with the aid of spiritual herbs, he would be able to recover fully. However, the semi-liquid red substance was Meng RuoYun\u2019s life essence! The moment it was expended, he would never be able to recover it. Furthermore, it was extremely harmful to his body and even if he nursed his health back, at least three years of his life would be lost!</p><br/><p>Who would have thought that an ambush would force a top-notch expert to such dire straits?! Before he could even see who his enemy was, he had already suffered life-threatening injuries!</p><br/><p>However, Meng RuoYun had no choice but to make that choice. From the very first attack of his opponent, Meng RuoYun knew that his opponent was a top-notch assassin in the world. When facing such an opponent, if Meng RuoYun was unable to turn the situation around and kept his back facing the opponent, he would be asking for death!</p><br/><p>Losing a few years of his life was better than dying on the spot!</p><br/><p>Even though his vitality was harmed and innards injured, he still had some confidence when facing the opponent head-on. At the very least he would be able to retaliate and not just escape for his life.</p><br/><p>However, what was completely out of Meng RuoYun\u2019s expectations was that the top-notch assassin in front of him was actually a 16 to 17-year-old teen! His cold face and frosty gaze coupled with a gleaming long sword in his hand. If not for the dense killing intent being emanated from this teen, Meng RuoYun would have thought that he was dreaming!</p><br/><p>How could a young teen who had not even grown hair yet actually force him to such a state? How was this possible?!</p><br/><p>The black-robed teen did not say a thing as his body drifted up and charged at Meng RuoYun without restraint. At the same time, the black-robed teen brandished his sword and his sword shot forward like a venomous viper.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill!\u201d At this moment, a loud roar sounded, shaking the leaves off the trees!</p><br/><p>\u201cKILLLLL!\u201d Following that, hundreds of people echoed back and killing intent burst forward like a tsunami! Rows of black-robed men dashed out from the shadows and pounced towards the allied forces of Above Heavens and the Xiao Family. Countless blades glowed under the moonlight and a small river of blood was formed. The two to three hundred people who had barely got into the trees were immediately slashed back down.</p><br/><p>In just the blink of an eye, Meng RuoYun had already exchanged tens of moves with the black-robed man. The teen was extremely experienced in battle and every move of his was vicious. The exquisiteness of his swordplay was also far out of Meng RuoYun\u2019s expectations. Even if it was only tens of moves, Meng RuoYun no longer dared to underestimate the enemy and treated his opponent as an equal.</p><br/><p>Amid this business, he looked down at the battlefield and was devastated!</p><br/><p>The black-robed men of unknown origins were all martial arts experts and every attack of theirs was extremely vicious. Facing his brothers who completely did not have the ability to retaliate, the black-robed men fought valiantly with every strike of theirs aiming to kill. In just a couple of breaths, the densely cluttered forest was much more spacious than before and the number of corpses on the forest floor became more and more!</p><br/><p>Meng RuoYun could not take it any longer and let out a loud roar. Exhausting even more vitality, he launched a couple of attacks to frantically force back the black-robed teen in front of him. Meng RuoYun\u2019s face had already turned completely pale. Making a back-flip in the air, he landed on the ground and roared, \u201cEveryone listen up! Follow this old man and kill a path out!\u201d He then raised his sword and charged out like a frenzied tiger. If he couldn\u2019t create a path of escape for his men, all of his more than 3000 men would perish in this forest!</p><br/><p>Since he brought them out, he must bring them back! Even if he had to die, he would have no hesitations!</p><br/><p>Meng RuoYun was putting his life on the line!</p><br/><p>The rear of the troops suddenly broke out into chaos and a human figure stormed through them like a ferocious dragon. Everywhere he went, a rain of blood would follow and he was like a gigantic ship breaking the still surface of the waters. Following his advance, the men to his left and right collapsed onto the ground and became a sea of corpses. All of their throats were spewing out blood and they were completely unable to hinder the maniacal advancement of that human figure! Behind him, there were only corpses. There weren\u2019t any survivors, nor were there any just injured.</p><br/><p>Just this person alone was like a corpse creating machine and he had truly killed a bloody path!</p><br/><p>With a single glance, Meng RuoYun knew that he definitely wasn\u2019t a match for that human figure. Not to mention the current him who was heavily injured, even in his prime he wouldn\u2019t be a match for this person! Thus, he turned around and charged away!</p><br/><p>The young assassin behind him seemed to have disappeared and the path behind him was empty already. Meng RuoYun was elated in his heart. With the few men around him, he tried to break out of the encirclement and gather the other forces towards the depths of the forest!</p><br/><p>Since their exit was blocked, he could only charge forward! Even if what lay in front of him was an unknown mountain of blades, this was the only road left for them!</p><br/><p>Along the way, more and more Above Heavens expert joined him on the ground. Everyone knew that this direction was the only path of survival for them!</p><br/><p>After a short ten minutes of killing, less than 800 men were able to follow Meng RuoYun to charge out! On top of that, most of them had injuries! Almost 80% of their troops were defeated in this short period of time!</p><br/><p>Meng RuoYun\u2019s heart turned cold. He no longer had the time to think about the cause of this tragedy and where the slip-up occurred. The only thought he had now was to charge out with all of his remaining men! They would only be able to find a shred of survival if they could charge out of this dense forest! However, it would only be a shred of survival. But when they were charging out, the black-robed experts only put up a halfhearted fight before allowing them to easily charge out!</p><br/><p><em>This is far too strange!</em></p><br/><p><em>There is definitely a more frightening ambush ahead!</em></p><br/><p>This odd reaction allowed Meng RuoYun to make the above conclusion. But despite knowing that, Meng RuoYun had no choice but to make his final struggle because what lay ahead was his only hope for survival!</p><br/><p>All of Meng RuoYun\u2019s thoughts were finally interrupted by an incoming bolt of lightning!</p><br/><p>That familiar green ray made Meng RuoYun gasp out in extreme fear before his death, \u201cHeaven Splitter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after these words left his mouth, Meng RuoYun was hacked into two parts, a clean slice through the middle from the head to his toes!</p><br/><p>Meng RuoYun, one of the three top-notch experts of Above Heavens and the younger brother of the martial fanatic Meng RuoXu, was cleaved in two by the Heaven Splitter before being able to display his strength! He did not even have the time to retaliate or react!</p><br/><p>Spinning around like a top, the Heaven Splitter swept out laterally and a green ray swept pass the surroundings. Within a thirty feet radius, all of Ling Tian\u2019s enemies were sliced in two. While some were sliced at the waist and others the back or shoulders, their deaths were equally miserable!</p><br/><p>The ground was covered in corpses with their eyes dilated in shock!</p><br/><p>Their forward momentum was immediately halted! Extreme fear could be seen in all of their eyes!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian drifted backward before ordering calmly, \u201cKill them all! Leave no one alive!\u201d The calmness of his voice was as though he was a nobleman ordering his servants to clean up the mansion.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Others might not be aware of Ling Tian\u2019s patience but how could she be unaware? That year, in order to investigate Ling Tian, she had spent quite a bit of her family\u2019s resources, grasping hold of whatever matters that were related to Ling Tian. Furthermore, with Ling Tian\u2019s skillful escape techniques, let\u2019s not mention half a year, he could even do so for his entire life if he wanted!</p><br/><p>Since the technology of the previous world couldn\u2019t even do anything to him, then what more the strength of one single person? Even if Justice had the ability to commune with heaven and earth, compared to Ling Tian\u2019s cunning, he could only lament at his powerlessness!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why not you just hide yourself and be done with it?\u201d Li Xue had a slight tone of reprimanding him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHide myself? Xue\u2019er, based on your current cultivation, you can probably see what realm I\u2019ve reached. Just based on my own efforts, I would probably need a decade to break through this bottleneck.\u201d Ling Tian exclaimed. \u201cTo have Justice pursue me like this, while it might be a death summons to others, to me it is the most opportune chance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnbelievably crafty!\u201d Li Xue grinned, \u201cPeople look with fear at such a matter, but you are actually using this sort of life-and-death struggle to hone your skills! What a weirdo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWahaha\u2026\u201d Ling Tian let out a huge laugh, before suddenly stalling as he stared in front of him. On the path ahead of them, there were signs of snapped branches, obviously the work of a large troop on horseback.</p><br/><p>\u201cXue\u2019er, it seems like we\u2019ve caught another big fish this time.\u201d Ling Tian smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig fish? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s the DongFang Family?\u201d Li Xue perked up, excitedly asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust based on the numbers, only the DongFang and BeiMing families have brought this many people. However, the BeiMing\u2019s group is filled with experts, so their tracks will not be so obvious. This only leaves us with the DongFang Family, whose ordinary guards number quite a few in their group, which will cause such obvious tracks to be formed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd only the DongFang family would rely on their own strength to appear arrogant, right?\u201d Li Xue lightly laughed in return, \u201cI really find it surprising that some people actually have the guts to offend you. Don\u2019t tell me that you\u2019ve never shown them your strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s precisely because they saw my strength, that it left them with this deep impression,\u201d Ling Tian grinned in return. \u201cThis is fighting for dominance for all under heavens, and this is different from fighting for hegemony in the pugilistic world. The strong can afford to stay in a corner for the pugilistic world, but on the chessboard for world dominance, it\u2019s the tallest trees that will get blown down first! No matter which side wins, the rest will suffer the same consequence of annihilation. Furthermore, this sort of annihilation will be an utter destruction of the country or the family clan! Thus, once someone like me who defies logic appears, won\u2019t I naturally become the public enemy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? From this, does it mean that you\u2019ve revealed your abilities at too early a date?\u201d Li Xue was astute and immediately guessed the crux of Ling Tian\u2019s troubles.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! At that time, I really underestimated the various experts of this world.\u201d Ling Tian let out a sign full of regret.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian couldn\u2019t be said to have no regrets!</p><br/><p>Since he had already endured for a whole sixteen years, would a few more years actually matter? At that time, they would have Long Xiao as the Sky Bearing Emperor being the figurehead, blocking the winds and rains from the outside while he could use his own strength to a greater potential, infiltrating the various aristocratic families more\u2026 once everything had been settled, how easy that would have been!</p><br/><p>However, under his rage, a thunderous commotion was created when all was still! The impact was created, but it went a little too far. This caused the entire world to turn towards his direction, and for him to become a thorn in the eye for the various major powers. This miscalculation ended up having blades in daylight and daggers in the night to rush towards him!</p><br/><p>But Ling Tian felt that his actions were justified!</p><br/><p>Be it to protect Ling Chen, or to rescue his father from the entrapment, or even to wash the Ling Family with blood, even if there were more options available for Ling Tian, he would still make the same moves!</p><br/><p>In this life, I want all of my relatives to live in safety and happiness!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Just as that heaven shaking sound of battle rang out, DongFang JingLei was seated in a tent not far away from the mountain, about to drink a cup of tea. When the soundwave passed by, the delicately designed teacup of white jade fell onto the ground, shattering into pieces.</p><br/><p>With his eyes tracing the direction of the source of noise, DongFang JingLei quietly drew in a deep breath. Astonishment filled his entire face, as such divine power should not be something that a human could unleash. Indeed, he was peerless for a reason! Even after cultivation for half his life, he originally thought his accomplishments were quite notable, but he probably couldn\u2019t even reach up to 20% of the power of that blow. Upon recalling how the Martial Order Medallion owner talked to them, he shivered. If he had not listen to Justice when Justice nicely asked them to scram, wouldn\u2019t he have turned into a corpse by now?</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei was the blood brother of the Family Head and normally led the expedition without hesitation, not knowing the meaning of fear. Even during the trip to Sky Bearing, he had no fear when facing the extremely imposing Ling Tian. However, he felt the thread of hesitation and fear about his decision to leave earlier quickly change into joy on his luck to have escaped early on!</p><br/><p>He might have over a thousand in military strength with him right now, with all of them being true elites, but in the eyes of Justice, this bunch was as good as reared livestock to him. Were he to actually want your life, even if one were to hide within a ten thousand strong army, then you would still have only one outcome: Death.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was close! Thankfully, we were not rash previously!\u201d DongFang JingLei felt a lingering fear, feeling a few drops of cold sweat on his forehead and a cool sensation on his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Master, before we left the house, the Family Head secretly entrusted us with something. Do you still recall?\u201d A light voice sounded beside him. This person was DongFang HuaHu, a trusted expert in the DongFang family. If one were to compare the entire DongFang Family, his martial skills would only lose to the family head DongFang JingTian and JingLei. He had few opponents and had already stabilized himself in the XianTian realm for at least ten years, his achievements not below that of the Third Master Yu ManTian.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did elder brother say\u2026? Oh, that. Let\u2019s not talk about it anymore.\u201d DongFang JingLei sigh, \u201cHuaHu, in such a circumstance, what kind of hope can one have? That\u2019s not hoping any more, that\u2019s called an illusion! An illusion which can\u2019t be fulfilled! I don\u2019t even know what brother is thinking of. Us coming here and receiving news of Ling Tian\u2019s death is considered good enough, but to have designs on the Martial Order Medallion owner, now that\u2019s preposterous! Justice\u2019s words already indicate the Beyond Heavens unlimited influence, just like beyond the heavens themselves. Once the words come out, they are akin to laws; laws that can\u2019t be disobeyed. This is a publicly acknowledged thing, and even if the offender is a prestigious person, there can only be death for him!</p><br/><p>DongFang HuaHu gravely sighed as he commented, \u201cThis subordinate also had his suspicions initially, but after previously seeing Justice\u2019s methods, I concluded that he is truly the top exponent of this world! I too am not sure what Family Head is thinking, to actually order us to be the fisherman and get rid of both Ling Tian and Justice when they\u2019re injured! It\u2019s alright if it\u2019s just Ling Tian, but what\u2019s so good in offending the Beyond Heavens? Can they even be offended in the first place?!\u201d DongFang HuaHu\u2019s tone contained a bit of dissatisfaction towards the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could elder brother be unaware of the reason? He\u2019s just using this excuse to get rid of me!\u201d DongFang JingLei suddenly shook his head sadly. \u201cMy existence is already threatening the influence he has in our family and the imperial court, and thus this mission is actually just to send me to my death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d DongFang HuaHu got a shock. \u201cSecond Master, are you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei let out a strained smile, \u201cHow could I be not sure? Elder brother has decided to get rid of me, and this isn\u2019t even a secret inside the family anymore! Let\u2019s just start with you. In front of my older brother, how much respect do you even give him now? And those two idiots, He ChuLai and He ChuQu, are even more incorrigible, only listening to me, and even daring to disobey my elder brother when he tried to send them on a mission! Nowadays, our brothers only know that the DongFang Family has a JingLei, but not a JingTian! Just this point is enough for my brother to throw me the death sentence! High merits will shake the owner, as high influence will shake the chief. There\u2019s no difference between these two phrases!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe did not even have the qualifications to sit on the family head\u2019s seat!\u201d DongFang HuaHu snorted out of his nose. \u201cSuch a foolish person is not entitled to the title of Family Head! Second Master, since he has already moved against you, why not we go all out\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d DongFang JingLei shook his head vigorously. \u201cAt such a chaotic time, with various powers eyeing each other, how can the DongFang Family be exposed to a rift? Me bringing all of you out this time can be considered hiding from him. It\u2019s fine if you guys don\u2019t want to help keep the peace and quiet, but you\u2019re even thinking of inciting chaos?\u201d</p><br/><p>HuaHu lowered his head, but his expression was still that of indignance. Suddenly, he lifted his head and asked in curiosity, \u201cSecond Master, but aren\u2019t we out this time solely to look for Ling Tian? Why is it\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei muttered, \u201cThis time round, our first objective is actually Ling Tian, and we definitely can\u2019t allow him to go back to Sky Bearing alive. The second objective is naturally to avoid my elder brother. While I don\u2019t place any importance on the seat of Family Head, Elder brother views that with extreme importance!\u201d As he spoke, he sighed again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still don\u2019t get it, what\u2019s so scary about this Ling Tian? He\u2019s being chased by Justice until he\u2019s about to die, but Second Master continues to brood over this matter. Are you afraid that he can\u2019t be eliminated fast enough?\u201d DongFang HuaHu scratched his head in confusion and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person is, after all, a genius! A once-in-a-century genius!\u201d A grave expression appeared to DongFang JingLei\u2019s face. \u201cIf we did not go over to Sky Bearing previously, I wouldn\u2019t have found out that Sky Bearing actually concealed such a frightening character, much like a sleeping dragon. With such talent, he actually wore the hat of the number one silkpants since he was young, why was that?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

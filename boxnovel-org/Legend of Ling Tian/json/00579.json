Ling Tian never imagined that the bones of this snake would be so hard. With half of his strength and the sharpness of the Heaven Splitter, he was actually unable to smash apart the head of this snake! Taking in a deep breath, he pulled out the Heaven Splitter from the snake\u2019s head and circulated all of his inner qi. With a dense green glow on the Heaven Splitter, Ling Tian did not hesitate any further and slashed downward!</p><br/><p>With a \u2018shua\u2019 sound, the head of the snake was split into two with one part being big and another part being small. It wasn\u2019t because Ling Tian missed his mark but because he was afraid of the inner pellet in the middle being smashed up.</p><br/><p>Tearing open the milky-white brain of the snake, Ling Tian dug out a jade-like item that was the size of a goose egg. It was cold to the touch and there seemed to be a semi-liquid substance inside of it. Ling Tian laughed happily at the discovery of the inner pellet. This time, he had truly struck a fortune! This inner pellet was probably enough to be split among the members of his Courtyard and the strength of his upper echelon would take a huge leap forward.</p><br/><p>With war breaking out in the continent, apart from emerging victorious from his battle with the Xiao Family, he had unexpectedly received such a treasure. This was akin to a pie dropping down from the heavens and Ling Tian could not help but be overjoyed. Even with his calm demeanor, Ling Tian had the urge to dance with joy.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s eyes were fixed on Ling Tian\u2019s hand as he swallowed a mouthful of saliva, \u201cYoung Noble, is this it? Why is it white in color? The previous inner pellet I got was black in color and was only one fifth the size of this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cAh\u2019Jian, this gigantic snake is much more frightening than the snake that you killed. This inner pellet is an item which can only be happened upon but not sought for. When we return to the Courtyard, you can wait for a huge increase in your cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crazed happiness could be seen on Ling Jian\u2019s face and he seemed to have thought of something as he said seriously, \u201cYoung Noble, if this inner pellet is going to be split up for consumption, I am afraid that everyone would only be able to receive limited benefits from it. Why don\u2019t you consume it alone so that your martial arts will exceed Justice and become the number one expert in the world? Perhaps this would be for the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at Ling Jian for a moment before smiling, \u201cAh\u2019Jian, you are my brother and I will not hide anything from you. I thought about this matter before but number one, this inner pellet is too large and no one in the world would be able to endure such an immense energy. Number two, ah ah, Ah\u2019Jian, so what if I reach the peak of the world? I would only be replacing Justice to have a taste of that loneliness. Number three, if we were to consume this inner pellet with our current cultivation, we wouldn\u2019t be too far away from Justice. So what is the point of me consuming it all? The final point, which is also the most important one, is something that I have said before. If I do not have my brothers to accompany me, what is the point of being the number one in the world? I am not a solitary man like that Justice after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian went silent.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled and put away the inner pellet. \u201cHowever, whether or not this inner pellet can be used, how it should be used, the effect of the pellet and how much each person can consume, will have to be refined when we return. It is still far too early to talk about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when Ling Tian was talking, a light thud sounded and the both of them turned to take a look. The two large eyeballs of the snake rolled out of its sockets and onto the ground. These two eyeballs were originally bloodied and mutilated, and both Ling Tian and Ling Jian did not notice it. After dropping out of their sockets, a portion of the bloodied meat fell off and a creamy white glow was actually revealed.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately tore off a bit of his sleeves and began wiping the eyeballs of the snakes clean. Following that, a duck egg sized pearl that was crystal clear gave out a slight warmth in his hand and was glowing slightly. It was actually a rare night illumination pearl!</p><br/><p>\u201cI blamed this snake wrongly previously and it is truly filled with treasures all over. This snake before me is a model citizen and its selfless donation truly makes this young noble extremely moved.\u201d Ling Tian was overjoyed. Even though he seemed to be extremely moved on the surface, he didn\u2019t stop dissecting the snake\u2019s body. Picking up the other eyeball, Ling Tian cleaned it up and it was indeed another night illumination pearl. With both the night illumination pearls glowing in his hands, the sight looked extremely spectacular.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Chi and the others had already finished slicing up the snake\u2019s meat. Upon seeing the two pearls in Ling Tian\u2019s hands, they all let out a gasp of surprise.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at the two pearls in his hands and his whole body broke out in a sweat.</p><br/><p>Inner pellet in the body, scales forming armor. Eyes like pearls, blood like gold. Lightning and thunder strikes in three thousand years, leaping into the dragon\u2019s gate in a single night!</p><br/><p>This was something that Ling Tian had read in his previous life in a book called \u2018Unusual Creatures in the Mountains and Rivers\u2019. This was the description of a snake species that had the ability to transform into a flood dragon and it was called the \u2018Scaled Armor Dragon\u2019. This snake was capable of training to the point its skin was impenetrable by weapons. When this Scaled Armor Dragon formed an inner pellet, its eyes turned into pearls and the blood in its body turned completely gold, this snake would transform into a flood dragon when it was in the water!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian never imagined that such a beast would exist in this world and he would also be able to meet it. Looking at this snake\u2019s condition, apart from the fact that its blood was still purple and had yet to turn gold, it had almost fulfilled all the conditions of transforming into a flood dragon.</p><br/><p>It seemed like even if this snake hadn\u2019t reached 3000 years of age, it wasn\u2019t too far off! No wonder this fellow would stay near the river. It was probably preparing the enter the river to transform into a dragon\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was completely covered in a cold sweat!</p><br/><p>He had indeed met with dogsh*t luck! If this snake wasn\u2019t knocked unconsciousness by the explosion of the gunpowder and Ling Tian met a live and kicking snake instead, this gigantic snake would definitely cause plenty of trouble for them today. Even if they were able to take care of it, there probably wouldn\u2019t be many of his 150 subordinates left and it was even possible for them to be all wiped out!</p><br/><p>Regardless of how confident Ling Tian was, he wouldn\u2019t be arrogant to the point he thought that he was capable of dealing with this ancient beast. This was supposed to be a beast that only existed in the legends. Since when had anybody ever seen it in reality?</p><br/><p>However, not only was Ling Tian able to see it, he was even able to skin it, eat its meat and drink its blood\u2026</p><br/><p>Goodness! It is truly a gigantic fellow!</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Ling Tian could not help but study the corpse of the snake carefully again. Being unable to find anything, Ling Tian let out a sigh and lamented about his inability to drink all of the blood which had flowed away. All of the blood which had flowed away was definitely a great supplement! He only filled up two bottles of blood! If he had thought about the snake\u2019s blood earlier, then even if he had to throw away everything in the containers that they brought, he would do so and fill them all up with snake blood!</p><br/><p>Looking at his hundred plus subordinates carrying large slabs of snake meat, Ling Tian finally found some balance in his heart. Let them eat it then, there wouldn\u2019t be any harm to eating it. It seems like after these 150 subordinates of his had a huge snake feast, they would definitely experience a huge increase in their strength.</p><br/><p>Just when Ling Tian had such a thought, he realized that these hundred plus subordinates of his turned completely red and were shaking unsteadily. They looked as though they couldn\u2019t stand any longer and they were full of perspiration with steam coming off of their heads.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was stunned for a moment before quickly realizing that it must have been the snake blood taking effect!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately ordered for his subordinates to put down everything on their backs, sit down cross-legged and begin circulating their inner qi. Thus, Ling Tian\u2019s exhausting task of guarding a hundred plus people began.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian originally wanted Ling Jian\u2019s help but upon turning behind, he realized that Ling Jian had also sat down.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had overlooked something. With the depths of his cultivation, especially after his recent breakthrough, the two mouthfuls of snake blood was quickly assimilated into his body after two complete circulations. However, his subordinates did not have such profound inner qi but had even drunk more than Ling Tian. Thus, their suffering was unavoidable.</p><br/><p>However, the moment they endured the powerful effect of the snake\u2019s blood, they would all experience a large increase in the quality of their bodies. From today onward, these 150 individuals would no longer be ordinary individuals. This was something that Ling Tian had never expected.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s cultivation was also extremely profound and apart from Ling Tian, he was the first who assimilated the snake\u2019s blood into his body. Standing up, his face was also flushed red.</p><br/><p>With a single look, Ling Tian knew what was going on. He smiled evilly and chuckled, \u201cAh\u2019Jian, do you want to vent your urges like Feng Mo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Vent his urges like Feng Mo? Ling Jian blinked his eyes in frustration and finally understood what Ling Tian meant. He had to admit that there was truly such a peculiar feeling in his body. He felt his whole body burning and his vessels dilating. In his whole life, this was the first time Ling Jian had such a feeling. After barely being able to control the urge in his body, Ling Jian stubbornly said, \u201cI won\u2019t go.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Ling Tian smiled and winked at Ling Jian, \u201cWhen these fellows get up later, they will definitely reveal their ugly selves. Even if a wild boar was in front of them, these fellows probably wouldn\u2019t be able to hold themselves back. After all, they probably do not have willpower like yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian thought about the burning sensation in his heart and the sudden outburst of lust. Looking at the reddened faces of the burly men, Ling Jian burst out into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Jian, after knowing you for more than ten years, this is the first time I have seen you laughing as such.\u201d Ling Chi stood up unsteadily and his suave face was flushed red as well. It was apparent that he wasn\u2019t feeling well either but his eyes were beaming with joy. Upon hearing Ling Jian laughing so heartily, he was extremely happy for his big brother and he had forgotten about his suffering.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian looked at Ling Chi as though he wanted to say something. However, he didn\u2019t say anything in the end and only smiled.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian, however, wouldn\u2019t let go of Ling Chi and he lamented, \u201cHaiz, Ling Chi. Look at how miserable you are currently. If only Die\u2019er was by your side right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chi had originally suppressed the heat in his body but upon hearing Ling Tian mention Die\u2019er, he felt a miserable sensation coursing throughout his whole body. He immediately felt as though his whole body was exploding and bent down pitifully, \u201cYoung noble\u2026 you really know how to tease me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Ling Tian and Ling Jian both burst out laughing together.</p><br/><p>Just like Ling Tian\u2019s expectations, in fact it was far worse than Ling Tian\u2019s expectations. After all the burly men endured the effects of the snake blood, they all stood up with their eyes bloodshot. They were like wild beasts in the mating season and were breathing heavily with their arteries dilated. All of them looked as though they had consumed an extremely potent aphrodisiac. If they weren\u2019t able to vent their urges in time, all of them would definitely be consumed by their lust!</p><br/><p>Facing this situation, both Ling Jian and Ling Chi were at a complete loss. Just what should they do?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a long sigh before standing up. He stood in front of all the burly men and his cold gaze swept past all of them, \u201cListen to my commands. Get into your pushup position!\u201d</p><br/><p>The powerful pressure emanating from Ling Tian\u2019s figure and his cold gaze shook everyone awake and they immediately carried out Ling Tian\u2019s orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cBegin the exercise!\u201d Ling Tian ordered, \u201cUsing the fastest speed possible, all of you are to do a thousand pushups within two hours! Ling Jian is in charge of supervising everyone. If anyone does not complete the exercise, you can punish them as you want!\u201d After giving this order, Ling Tian shut his eyes and sat on a tree stump.</p><br/><p>Hehe, what aphrodisiac? The blood snake is just bringing out the natal urges of these men. The best way to deal with these men would be to train them crazily. After training them to the point they cannot even move a single finger, let\u2019s see if all of you have the energy to think about other things.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sneered in his heart. Not to mention drinking a few mouthfuls of snake blood, even if you guys consume viagra, I will be able to let you vent it all out by doing pushups!</p><br/><p>Hearing the command of doing a thousand pushups in two hours, the hundred and fifty burly men who were burning with lust all let out wails and groans.</p><br/><p>Through Ling Tian\u2019s design, pushups, situps, squats, duck walks, and planking had become the most basic training method in the Ling Family Courtyard. However, doing 1000 pushups in two hours was truly too cruel. It was no wonder that these burly men were wailing out in bitterness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up! Stop wasting time.\u201d Ling Jian wouldn\u2019t show mercy to them and he immediately sent out his boundless killing intent. All of them felt a shiver down their spines and hurriedly got to work.</p><br/><p>******</p><br/><p>Xiao Family.</p><br/><p>An unexpected flood completely changed the situation of the battlefield!</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan spat out a mouthful of blood and stained his snow-white beard.</p><br/><p>After experiencing the slight tremors, the Xiao Family didn\u2019t think that anything serious had happened. However, they didn\u2019t expect to receive news of the river water being diverted a mere half a day later. The river water surged into the southeast hinterlands and there were thousands of people who had suffered from the flooding. As for the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass which bore the brunt of the flood, they only had the chance to send out a messenger pigeon.</p><br/><p>After waiting nervously for a full four hours, Xiao FengHan finally received news. The two mountain peaks by the side of the river collapsed for some unknown reason and fell into the river, cutting off the water of the river! With nowhere for the river water to be drained, the river water could only flow backward. The surrounding banks of the river was already a large lake. As for the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass, it was already decimated and not a single person could escape alive!</p><br/><p>It was like thunder in a clear sky!</p></div>\n</div>"}

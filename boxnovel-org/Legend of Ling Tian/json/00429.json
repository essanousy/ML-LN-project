The Lei Family was the party who requested us to aid them to build up their foundations here, and we are only satisfying their request. We are merely inviting the Lei Family here to form an alliance with us, and by offering them a bountiful piece of land, we have already displayed our full sincerity! The moment our crisis is resolved, we will be able to both retreat and attack. With the thousand years of foundation of our Yu Family, we would definitely not allow the Lei Family to take advantage of us! Furthermore, I am certain that the continent will break out into chaos within two years and the chess pieces on the continent will definitely be reshuffled again. The continent being united is already a fixed outcome with the only variable being the leader of the continent. At that time, whether or not our Yu Family is the one ruling over the continent, the problem of the Lei Family would definitely be resolved for sure. Why do we have to worry about nothing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang thought for a moment before letting out a sigh, \u201cThis little brother is indeed in admiration of big brother\u2019s foresight. I wonder when big brother wants me to set off?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter must not be delayed and you should set off as quickly as possible!\u201d A fierce glare shone in Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes as he said solemnly, \u201cThe storms are stirring and your journey will definitely be filled with danger. You must be sure to take care of yourself!\u201d As he said that, he intentionally glanced at Yu ManTian.</p><br/><p>Just as Yu ManLou expected, Yu ManTian couldn\u2019t help but grow restless when he heard that the journey would be filled with danger. \u201cBig brother, we can only rely on brothers in times of war. Your cultivation is extremely profound and there isn\u2019t a need for me to worry about you. However, second brother does not have exceptional means. Why don\u2019t you allow me to accompany second brother on his trip and we will be able to take care of each other along the way. Hearing what you have just said, I just can\u2019t be at ease!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Yu ManLou began to frown as though he was in difficulty. As he stroked his beard, he looked at Yu ManTian. \u201cIt isn\u2019t that I won\u2019t allow you to go. However, I just can\u2019t be at ease with that rash temper of yours. If you were to lose control of yourself, you would only be creating trouble for your second brother. If that\u2019s the case\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian\u2019s boorish face turned bright red, \u201cRest assured big brother, we are all scholarly individuals who are definitely able to control our emotions. I will definitely listen to second brother during the journey and not create any trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou snorted, \u201cIf you promise me that you won\u2019t touch wine throughout the whole journey, I will allow you to go with your second brother. If not, you can give up on that idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so good about drinking wine? I have long kicked that habit! After drinking the fragrant wine of Ling Tian, those inferior wines no longer interest me!\u201d Yu ManTian said with excitement, \u201cDoes that mean that you have agreed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou seemingly reluctantly nodded his head and then shouted, \u201cIf any goes wrong along the way, I will hold you responsible for it! Do you understand?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian muttered under his breath and looked as though he wanted to say something but remained silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must both take care of each other along the way. Return as soon as possible lest you make me worried. Go and make your preparations.\u201d Yu ManLou let out a soft sigh and turned around with a depressed look. However, no one noticed a slight trace of joy flashing in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang didn\u2019t notice anything wrong and couldn\u2019t spot any flaws in Yu ManLou\u2019s plans. Right when he was about to take his leave, he suddenly turned back and asked, \u201cBig brother, there is one more matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d An untraceable light flashed in Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do about XiMen Sa from the XiMen Family spreading rumors about our alliance?\u201d Yu ManTang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is no more than a dancing clown trying to borrow the prestige of our Yu Family to stabilize the situation of his XiMen Family. I have my ideas on the matter and you don\u2019t need to worry about it!\u201d Yu ManLou frowned and said in a relaxed manner, but a cold glare flashed in his eyes!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I will be taking my leave. Big brother, you are going to be stationed in Bright Jade City alone where the core of our family lies and will definitely be bogged down by loads of work. Furthermore, there are hidden spears and arrows all around at the present moment. May big brother take care of yourself.\u201d Yu ManTang said with sincerity.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou felt a sense of warmth in his heart and he turned around. After a short moment later, he said calmly, \u201cAlright. You may leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his two brothers disappear from his sight, a bitter look surfaced on his face and he said with a long sigh, \u201cWhy do I have to scheme against my closest brothers? If not for that brat Ling Tian, how would things have turned out like this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Calming himself down, Yu ManLou let out a command, \u201cMen!\u201d</p><br/><p>A black-dressed figure then appeared without a trace, \u201cDoes the Family Head have any instructions?\u201d</p><br/><p>A thick killing intent rose from Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes and he growled, \u201cSend my orders, everyone from the Soul Pavilion is to be deployed and assist the Soul Brothers in killing Ling Tian! The Shadow Pavilion is to assist them in the dark and pass this message to the Blood Slaughter Pavilion: \u2018the debt from before is wiped clean\u2019. Order them to ensure that Ling Tian will never return to Sky Bearing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The night was dark, and a small flickering flame was lit.</p><br/><p>The young noble of the Shui Family, Shui QianHuan, was seated silently in the room with a tranquil expression on his face. However, his heart was actually filled with turmoil at this moment.</p><br/><p>He never imagined that with the aid of the First Pavilion, everything would proceed so smoothly! The matter proceeded so smoothly to the point that Shui QianHuan found it to be unbelievable! Those who still wielded authority in the Bright Jade City were all assassinated in a couple of days and almost half of his Shui Family members had already successfully risen into positions of power. The way everything proceeded without a hitch made Shui QianHuan feel a sense of fear! If the Ling Family didn\u2019t purchase the destruction of the Yu Family but his Shui Family instead, would their Shui Family be able to survive the ordeal?!</p><br/><p>Now that the city was almost within his complete grasp, Shui QianHuan couldn\u2019t help but feel that he was in a dream.</p><br/><p>With the plan proceeding so smoothly, could all of this be a scheme of the Yu Family? Shui QianHuan would never dare to underestimate the Family Head of the Yu Family, Yu ManLou. Be it Yu ManLou\u2019s wits or strength, it was impossible for Shui QianHuan to be a match for him. However\u2026</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan couldn\u2019t believe that he was actually able to gain the upper hand against Yu ManLou in Yu ManLou\u2019s very own territory!</p><br/><p>The door of the room suddenly opened silently and a chilly aura flooded into the room. A black-masked man then drifted into the room like a bat descending from the night sky.</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan hurriedly stood up. When facing this infamous Pavilion Head of the First Pavilion, Shui QianHuan himself couldn\u2019t decipher the feelings he currently had. There was fear, admiration, respect, horror, and a few other feelings that he couldn\u2019t describe! For some reason, Shui QianHuan couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of discomfort whenever this Pavilion Head stared at him, despite knowing that they were currently on the same team. Shui QianHuan felt as though there was a venomous snake eyeing him and getting ready to pounce on him and rip him to shreds at any time!</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder why the Pavilion Head has suddenly come to seek me? I am extremely satisfied with your efficiency!\u201d Shui QianHuan asked carefully. After a few days of interaction, despite using every possible mean he had, Shui QianHuan couldn\u2019t change the attitude the First Pavilion Head had towards him. Furthermore, Shui QianHuan could clearly feel that the only reason why the First Pavilion was willing to work with him was that it was a mission from the Ling Family. Perhaps it was due to a frightening amount of gold or perhaps it was because the First Pavilion owed the Ling Family a great favor. But towards his Shui Family, the First Pavilion Head didn\u2019t even display a single shred of goodwill.</p><br/><p>This was something that frustrated Shui QianHuan greatly. No matter how powerful the Ling Family was, the Ling Family was only one of the eight Great Families and was once a \u2018counterfeit\u2019 Great Family. If not for Ling Tian\u2019s strength, the Ling Family would have probably submitted to another Great Family by now or been completely eradicated by the roots. However, his Shui Family was one of the biggest families in the three continents with only the Yu Family being a match for them.</p><br/><p>Just why did the First Pavilion dare to disregard them completely?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, the matters in the Bright Jade City have been completed and this seat is here to bid my farewell to young noble Shui. The First Pavilion will pull out from the city completely, and our deal will end at daybreak tomorrow.\u201d The chilly voice of the black-masked man sounded, and Shui QianHuan felt his hair stand up on edge.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnd of the deal? All of you are going to retreat? Why the rush?\u201d Shui QianHuan was startled, \u201cThe members of our Shui Family are still on the way here and have not arrived yet. It probably isn\u2019t appropriate for you to leave the city tomorrow. If the Yu Family and dregs of Northern Wei retaliate, our manpower will be insufficient and we will definitely suffer huge losses.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suffer huge losses? Isn\u2019t that for the best? The black-masked man thought to himself but replied in an indifferent manner, \u201cThat is not something that I have to consider. Furthermore, I have said that the deal has already come to an end! To be honest, even if we were to stay behind, we wouldn\u2019t make a move if the Yu Family or Northern Wei dregs retaliate.\u201d The black-masked man said with an undisguised irritation, \u201cRegardless of how much silver you offer us, we must first have the life to spend it. Our First Pavilion doesn\u2019t owe your Shui Family anything and your life and death are not of our concern!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan fell silent for a moment before saying with a smile, \u201cIf it is an issue of silver, Pavilion Head can be at ease and we can definitely discuss the matter. If it the Ling Family alone can\u2019t satisfy you, the thousand year foundation of my Shui Family will definitely not disappoint you. This young noble thinks that we can consider a plan for long-term cooperation. We will provide the money, and Pavilion Head can provide the manpower. With the both of us benefiting from that process, wouldn\u2019t it be a wonderful matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>With the First Pavilion\u2019s strength and efficiency, it would naturally be the best if he could recruit them into his camp. If not, having a long-term cooperative relationship wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing either! As long as the First Pavilion Head gave a price, Shui QianHuan would agree to it first before making future plans.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong-term cooperation?\u201d The black-masked man sneered, \u201cIt is best for young noble Shui to talk about this after you have become the family head. Does young noble Shui think that you have the qualifications to talk to this seat about this?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

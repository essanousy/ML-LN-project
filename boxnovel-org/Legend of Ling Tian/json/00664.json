Our brothers in the front cannot hold on for much longer, may Marshal make a decision soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecret weapon? What secret weapon?!\u201d Xiao JianFeng frowned with his face pale. He could feel the tremors of the earth previously and the generals flooding in had confirmed his worries. Looking at his subordinates\u2019 frightened expressions, he could not help but be furious. \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a large commotion? Look at how all of you are acting! How useless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY\u2026es, this subordinate saw black pieces being thrown over before a series of explosions sounded over the battlefield. Countless brothers were immediately reduced to a pile of mush and died without a complete corpse,\u201d said a burly man with shards and fragments embedded on his chest. Blood trailed down from the corner of his lips with a pathetic expression on his face. \u201cWe did not even see where the enemies were and we died an unknowing death. Furthermore, all of our brothers died without even a complete corpse! Some of them even had their bones completely reduced to dust without anything left behind. It was like the descent of a lightning deity and many of our brothers at the front have been scared silly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence filled the entire tent.</p><br/><p>Jian FengHan\u2019s eyes flashed with coldness and he hollered, \u201cAudacious! You actually dare to spread heresy and disturb the morale of my army. Men, push him out and execute him in public. Anyone who disturbs the morale of the army shall be executed without mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The soldiers by the side immediately took a few steps forward to capture the burly man. That burly man seemed to have been scared silly and did not even attempt to fight back as he muttered, \u201c\u2026the descent of the lightning deity\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang let out a long sigh and said with a tinge of depression, \u201cLet him go, there isn\u2019t a need to continue lying to ourselves already. For me to escape danger this time, I only treated it as taking a chance. For Xue\u2019er to let me go and inform me about the secret weapon of the Ling Family was no more than a scheme to defeat the Xiao Family without a fight! Who would have thought that such an invincible killing weapon would have spread all across the Ling Army! How can mere human strength be a match for such a killing weapon? How would our Xiao Family be able to fight against such a weapon? Do the heavens want our demise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao JianFeng looked at Xiao FengYang with a doubtful expression, \u201cWhy does Second Master say such words? Even if the secret weapon of the Ling Family is powerful, our Xiao Family still has a million soldiers behind us! Even if we use a human wave method to swarm them, we would be able to drown them with our numbers! This brat has already been scared silly by the enemy\u2019s tricks and there is no pity to kill him. For him to mess up the morale of our army, what is the point of leaving him alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot! Didn\u2019t you personally witness the strength of that killing weapon? How dare you spout such outrageous words! Do you truly want to destroy our Xiao Family?!\u201d Xiao FengYang hollered. He then stood up and ordered, \u201cFrom now on, the entire army shall stop battling and guard our camp. Check the casualties of our camp and stabilize the morale while awaiting orders! None of you are allowed to make any action without any orders! None of you are allowed to engage in battle with the Ling Army! Anyone who defies my orders shall be executed without mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then turned around and glared at Xiao JianFeng with a cold gaze, \u201cThis order applies, regardless of who you are! As for the matters regarding the war, it will have to wait for me to return to the Xiao Family. A decision will be made after I discuss this matter with my big brother! This is an order!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe listen and obey Second Master\u2019s orders!\u201d Xiao JianFeng hurriedly stood up straight and accepted the military order.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang\u2019s prestige in the army was above that of Xiao FengHan. With him giving these strict orders, not a single person would dare to defy him!</p><br/><p>It was also thankfully so\u2026</p><br/><p>With his nightmares turning real, Xiao FengYang became extremely anxious. Not to mention resting and having a meal, he did not even take a sip of water before rushing back to the south-east.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Ling Tian who had been sailing on top of the surface of the ocean had finally arrived on Heavenly Star.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian did not waste a single day when he was on the ocean because he had another peerless expert accompanying him. This peerless expert was naturally the number one expert in the world, Justice. Regardless of whether it is in the realm of martial arts or medicinal arts, Justice was not an individual who would accept being number two. He could clearly sense that Ling Tian had achieved a huge breakthrough in his trip to Heavenly Wind but had another huge drawback. His cultivation had achieved a huge breakthrough but his personal realm had not caught up to his cultivation thus resulting in great disharmony. While his cultivation could be raised through fortuitous encounters, his personal realm required the accumulation and understanding of many years.</p><br/><p>The increase of one\u2019s cultivation did not indicate the increase of one\u2019s strength. In truth, Ling Tian\u2019s cultivation had indeed increased rapidly and had even exceeded Justice. However, after meeting fortuitous encounters one after another, his cultivation had far exceeded his personal realm. While the danger wasn\u2019t revealed at the moment and he would be able to easily deal with those weaker than him, the moment he deals with an expert of his level or just a slight bit weaker than him, even if he can attain victory, his heart demons would definitely be unleashed! With his martial arts at such a level, his heart demon was something that he would not be able to avoid.</p><br/><p>Before Ling Tian achieving a breakthrough, his mental state was far above his cultivation level. But after achieving this fortuitous encounter, his cultivation shot forward like a rocket and his mental state was now behind his cultivation realm. It can be seen just how big of a benefit Ling Tian had received!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was also a martial arts expert and he had also overlooked this matter before. He had truly trapped himself in a hazy obstruction because of the rocketing advancement of his cultivation. After Justice reminded him of his flaw, Ling Tian naturally understood the simple logic immediately. Thus, he spent the past month cultivating his heart and frequently requested pointers from Justice. While his cultivation was still not in complete unison with his mental state, he was no longer in danger of experiencing cultivation deviation.</p><br/><p>When his mental state was in complete unison with his cultivation, Ling Tian would be invincible in the entire world! Even Justice had to admit that Ling Tian\u2019s present cultivation was one that no one had ever been able to achieve from the ancient times until now!</p><br/><p>Before Ling Tian could even enjoy his welcoming ceremony after disembarking from the ship, he received two different letters from Duke Ling and Marshal Ling Xiao. The contents of their letters were the same: Quickly return to Sky Bearing and prepare to set up the empire.</p><br/><p>It seems like Duke Ling finally couldn\u2019t withstand the pressure from the various ministers and was about to ascend to the throne.</p><br/><p>This news allowed Ling Tian to heave a huge sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>As an empire, the position of the emperor had truly been vacant for far too long. Regardless of whether it was in political or military matters, something seemed extremely wrong without a sacred decree. It just didn\u2019t seem proper enough. From now on, it was time for the empire with surname Ling to rise up!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was truly overjoyed. While his grandfather wasn\u2019t young anymore, under his meticulous care, it was definitely possible for his grandfather to stay on the throne for a good ten plus years. After his grandfather, there was still his father and his father would probably be able to hold on for a good twenty years. When it was time for him to ascend to the throne, it would probably be a good thirty years later. At that time, he would quickly find his son to take his place and it would save him from all the trouble.</p><br/><p>I am definitely not going to be this darn emperor. Not to mention the fact that it is an extremely tiring job, there are still a large number of silly rules and rites. How frustrating! The large pile of empire\u2019s affairs is even more frustrating! Now that he does not need to be the emperor, he would be happy even thinking about it!</p><br/><p>Ever since he disembarked from the ship, Justice had disappeared without a trace. Even Ling Tian did not know when that fellow had left. Ling Tian had only cursed him a couple of times under his breath before forgetting about the matter.</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian leisurely made his way back to the Ling Family Courtyard, it was already the third afternoon. Looking at the four beauties welcoming him from afar, Ling Tian felt warmth fill his heart.</p><br/><p>Getting off his horse, he quickly walked forward with Shui QianRou and Yu BingYan.</p><br/><p>By the side, Ling Chen, Li Xue and Xiao YanXue walked forward with agitation on their faces. Only Princess JiaoYue stood rooted to the spot not knowing what to do. Watching her own cousin who was also her appointed husband walking over, her eyes became hazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWahahaha, little beauties, do you miss me? Come and give me a hug. Err?\u201d Along the way, apart from cultivating, he would be facing an old man like Justice. Thus, little young noble Ling was extremely stifled. Ling Tian opened up his arms and wanted to give all the ladies a bear hug. Just when he was about to release some of his pent up frustrations, he could only hug air.</p><br/><p>The three ladies rushed over with a fervent gaze and glee of meeting again after parting for such a long time. However, the target wasn\u2019t Ling Tian\u2026</p><br/><p>Under the gazes of everyone present, the three ladies rushed forward to embrace Yu BingYan and Shui QianRou letting out squeals of excitement while joyfully chattering under their breath.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s arms were still spread with the posture of wanting to give the girls a hug. However, he could only stand there alone with frustration all over his face.</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe and the others suppressed their laughter and walked forward to pay their respects to Ling Tian. Only then did Ling Tian put down his widespread arms and converse with those who came to welcome him while glaring hatefully at the three ladies. Hmph, I shall let you girls remain delighted for the time being. While I cannot do anything to you girls, just wait to see how little young noble Ling will torment you girls later. He has been saving his energy for a very long time! Hmph hmph hmph\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a crafty laugh in his heart as his eyes shone with a bright glow. This made Meng LiGe who was standing opposite him tremble slightly. Why is young noble looking at me with such a strange look? Could it be that he has stifled himself for far too long and is going to \u2018eat\u2019 whatever that comes his way?! Thinking about that, he could not help but have goosebumps all over and quickly escaped with an excuse.</p><br/><p>In these few months, Ling Tian had truly been stifled badly. While he had Yu BingYan to accompany him in his short stay at Heavenly Wind, Yu BingYan\u2019s body was far too weak for him. Little young noble Ling could only begin to have his enjoyment and his beauty would plead for mercy and fall into a deep sleep. In the end, little young noble Ling could only stare at young noble Ling without having his excitement satisfied.</p><br/><p>Such a feeling was truly even worse than not doing it at all\u2026</p><br/><p>When he was on the ship, he was even worse off. He was in seclusion for long periods of time and even if he went out for a breather occasionally, he would have to face the old man Justice who he could not afford to provoke. Even if he wanted to do that, he had no place to do it. Now that he had the chance to do that, it would definitely\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and the other two ladies who had their backs facing Ling Tian trembled slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin Tian.\u201d Princess JiaoYue had lost a great deal of weight during this period and looked much skinnier than before.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a sigh. This cousin of his had a gentle temperament and was prettier than her peers. She had always taken good care of Ling Tian since he was young and many of Ling Tian\u2019s childhood days were filled with the memories of this cousin. However, for some reason, Ling Tian could never have any feelings for her. Furthermore, he had personally dragged her father down from his throne and also turned his father crazy with his very hands. All of these\u2026</p><br/><p>That was Princess JiaoYue\u2019s biological father! Regardless of what unforgivable sin he committed and regardless of how scheming he was, since they were on opposing sides, there was nothing wrong with how Ling Tian had treated him. However, now that Princess JiaoYue was in the picture, it was truly extremely awkward for him.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the world knew Princess JiaoYue from the original Sky Bearing Empire was Ling Tian\u2019s woman. Furthermore, she was his first official woman. While everyone in the empire understood the intentions behind Long Xiang\u2019s betrothal of Princess JiaoYue to Ling Tian, it was also because of this that everyone in the empire knew that Princess JiaoYue was Ling Tian\u2019s woman. At times, Ling Tian wanted to just ignore everything that has happened. However, he just couldn\u2019t be at ease whenever facing JiaoYue.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t guilt. Ling Tian would never feel guilty about this matter and Long Xiang wasn\u2019t worthy of Ling Tian feeling guilty. He wouldn\u2019t regret his actions either and he would make the same choice even if he has to make it ten times. However, he just had an inexplicable feeling in his heart.</p><br/><p>Seeing JiaoYue receiving him at the entrance of the Ling Family Courtyard, this represented Duke Ling and Old Madam Ling\u2019s attitude towards JiaoYue!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s woman.</p><br/><p>She was someone that Ling Tian had to admit even if he did not want to!</p><br/><p>Haiz! How frustrating. Thinking about the scene of JiaoYue staying in his yard and muttering to herself when he returned to the Ling Residence, his heart could not help but cramp up slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCousin.\u201d Ling Tian looked at her calmly, \u201cAfter not seeing you for so long, you have become skinnier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Princess JiaoYue\u2019s eyes were fuzzy and she continued, \u201cAfter not seeing cousin for such a long time, you have become more mature.\u201d The awkwardness between them was something that they could both feel.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ah, when walking around in the pugilistic world, I have to spend my nights in the outdoor and eat whatever that comes my way. After experiencing so much, I will naturally seem older.\u201d Ling Tian let out a joke before turning around and saying, \u201cDon\u2019t stand outside so foolishly, let us all go in. I still have things to discuss with all of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the ladies heard those words, they revealed a look of their little plot being fulfilled. Even Yu BingYan and Shui QianRou who just returned chuckled together with the other girls as they entered the Courtyard. By the door, only Ling Tian and Princess JiaoYue were left behind.</p><br/><p>Mmm? Even they are trying to give JiaoYue a chance to spend some alone time with me? Just\u2026 what is going on?</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this far too strange?!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was truly puzzled. Why are all these jealous ladies suddenly so different today?</p><br/><p>What Ling Tian didn\u2019t know was that before JiaoYue\u2019s arrival, Old Madam Ling had already gathered Ling Chen and Li Xue to have a long conversation with them and introduced JiaoYue to them. Especially how she had no one to rely on and how she was deeply in love with Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Old Madam Ling was extremely clear that of all the women around Ling Tian, the only one who was capable of influencing Ling Tian was Ling Chen. Ling Chen had never requested anything from Ling Tian and would only silently put forth effort for Ling Tian. Because of this, the moment Ling Chen opened her mouth, regardless of what her request was, Ling Tian would definitely treat it seriously. As long as Ling Chen had a request, Ling Tian would definitely hear her request!</p><br/><p>The other individual was Li Xue. Old Madam Ling did not understand where this lady came from and what kind of background she had. In fact, she did not even understand why Ling Tian trusted her so much. This also allowed Old Madam Ling to understand that the influence Li Xue had was no less than Ling Chen in certain areas.</p><br/><p>For JiaoYue to receive the recognition of Ling Tian, the largest barrier wasn\u2019t her grandson but Ling Chen and Li Xue. The only important thing was for the two of them to agree. On the contrary, if these two girls do not agree, even if she had a thousand brilliant plans, it was useless! At the same time, Ling Tian\u2019s personal opinion wasn\u2019t too important. As long as these two ladies agreed, Ling Tian had to agree even if he wasn\u2019t willing.</p><br/><p>In her heart, Old Madam Ling cared for her granddaughter greatly and the happiness of her granddaughter was also her wish. Furthermore, with the other party being her only grandson, Old Madam Ling was naturally willing to make this marriage happen. While it wouldn\u2019t be possible for her to become empress, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing for her to be a consort. Furthermore, JiaoYue\u2019s gentle character truly wasn\u2019t suited to become an empress.</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling\u2019s eyesight was indeed accurate and she was also extremely clear about the influence of her words. She was certain that Ling Chen and Li Xue would definitely agree to her as long as she the one to open her mouth. After all, she was Ling Tian\u2019s biological grandmother!</p><br/><p>Everything had turned out as Old Madam Ling had predicted. With Ling Chen\u2019s gentleness, she naturally wouldn\u2019t voice any objections. As for Li Xue, no matter how unbridled she was, she was completely helpless in the face of Ling Tian\u2019s grandmother. She still had to accept Old Madam Ling\u2019s request with a face full of smiles! Even though Miss Li Xue was extremely against this feudalistic family structure!</p><br/><p>In truth, Miss Li Xue had also seen things through already. Ling Tian was someone destined to be the emperor and he will probably have many more women in the future. She might as well gather all of her sisters together to prevent Ling Tian from having any more ladies in the future. If that\u2019s the case, why would she be so foolish to defy Old Madam Ling?</p><br/><p>After coming into contact with JiaoYue, Li Xue had also gradually begun to pity this gentle and classic beauty. They had already begun making plans and the moment Yu BingYan and Shui QianRou returned, their plans would be implemented.</p><br/><p>This was also the reason why they were so excited when they saw Yu BingYan and Shui QianRou.</p><br/><p>How would Ling Tian who was being hidden in the dark know of all this? He was still fantasizing about finding a chance to have a threesome or foursome with all of his ladies and let his little young noble have a good battle. How could he have imagined that his own s*xual happiness had already been listed as something for them to strictly control?</p></div>\n</div>"}

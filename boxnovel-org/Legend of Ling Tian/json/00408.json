Will. Not. Let. Anyone. Off!</p><br/><p>No matter who!</p><br/><p>In a split second, the crowd parted like water flowing downhill, only leaving Justice and the fifteen people from the self-proclaimed Xiao Family. Of course, even the injured NanGong TianLong had, with the help of his family members, run off as quickly as he could!</p><br/><p>Justice slowly turned around to face them, indifferently commenting, \u201cWhile I might have the tag of Heavenly Justice, I hate killing the most. Before killing Ling Tian, I didn\u2019t want to engage in any other sort of killing! However, since some people are naturally seeking for death, provoking my baseline of \u2018doing what I say\u2019, then this seat is very willing to grant their wishes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng JueChen sniggered as he replied, \u201cJustice, the two of us were originally enemies to begin with. We\u2019ve lain within the mortal world for over four decades, concealing our identities and forsaking everything within the human world in order to annihilate your Beyond Heavens! Others might be afraid of this martial head name, but do you think this old man puts you in my eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, it was you guys.\u201d Justice calmly spoke. \u201cThis explains why you were willing to stay, or even dared to remain behind. An ambitious character, but having to conceal your identity for over forty years, living a life without seeing the daylight, neither alive nor dead. Our Sect head never desired to pursue the past matters, but you guys just had to send yourselves up for the slaughter. No worries, I\u2019ll grant you that wish. Under my hands, you will not have pain or injuries, only death! I\u2019ll send you to meet your ancestors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng JueChen suddenly gave out a mournful laugh, \u201cJustice, do you really think you can achieve that? Beyond Heavens? Dogsh*t! Forty years ago, your Beyond Heavens launched a sneak attack, using all sorts of underhanded methods to defeat us. A bunch of sanctimonious hypocrites, making my sect lose most of its fighting strength and decline as a result. This blood feud will not allow us to share the same skies, now and forever! Today, I want to reclaim a debt of blood from your body!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Sect has never bothered to dip their fingers into worldly affairs. Forty years ago, were it not for the fact that you guys came to the Heavenly Star Continent to try to eliminate us, we would not have taken such drastic action. We were merely enacting heaven\u2019s will, getting rid of evil presences from this world! A bunch of people who overestimate themselves, even death can\u2019t wipe away your crimes. How dare you still talk about dignity and such matters, what a joke!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mother\u2019s fart! Justice, the Beyond Heavens Sect is merely a cold-blooded executioner! What is it based on that you guys are considered number one under the heavens, while we have to live our lives in hiding? The heavens require a change in power, Justice!\u201d Meng JueChen venomously spat in return.</p><br/><p>Justice merely sighed wearily, as he closed his eyes and replied, \u201cNo wonder then. It was no wonder that Yin JueKong\u2019s treasured saber landed in the hands of the Xiao family, and no wonder their ambition is so huge! Such deep plotting! It was actually all because of you guys. However, to want to claim a blood debt from my body, did you believe that you already possessed the ability of Yin JueKong from a millennium ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the words Yin JueKong, a change came over the faces of Meng JueChen and company, and even Ling Tian who was hiding behind a tree showed some shock.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian clearly remembered that on one of the days where he was idly chatting with Ye QingChen, the latter had mentioned a few words. \u201cWith outstanding martial arts approaching the level of a saint, breaking through the boundary for the peak of martial arts. That is the Above Heavens Sect head Yin JueKong, who has killed enough people that the bones could make up a hill!\u201d</p><br/><p>Could it be that all the so-called Xiao Family experts actually belonged to the Above Heaven Sect? That the Xiao Family always had the Above Heavens Sect people pulling the strings? Ling Tian\u2019s heart grew heavy at that thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile we do not possess the exceptional skills of Ancestor Yin, it\u2019s a simple matter if we want to just kill you!\u201d Meng JueChen clenched his teeth and spoke. \u201cToday, let us perish together with the martial head!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following his words, the fifteen experts fanned out, forming a semicircle and placing Justice in the middle. The sound of scraping metal could be heard as all their swords left the sheaths at the same time, dazzling the eyes of any who saw it.</p><br/><p>A chance! Ling Tian exclaimed to himself. He secretly calculated, wondering if he could wipe Justice off in a single blow if he were to work together with this group of people. Even if they could not, there was still Li Xue, who was showing a considerable intention to protect him! The people from Above Heavens were obviously experts. One could see that every one of them were at least in the small success stage of the XianTian realm. Under such a lineup, even if it were Justice, he would also need to put in his all to defend. If he were to join in with Li Xue, what would the situation become?</p><br/><p>If he could wipe out Justice now, then what would happen in the future? If he could not kill Justice now, then what? Ling Tian did not forget that these fifteen people from Above Heavens also had their own motives. While they held a teeth gnashing-hatred against Justice, Ling Tian also believed that, given the opportunity, they would also not let him go!</p><br/><p>After weighing the costs and benefits, Ling Tian finally chose to give up on this attractive idea. However, since there was an opportunity which presented itself, it would not be wise to leave it hanging! While he had given up on this chance to deal with Justice, he would not do so for NanGong TianLong as well as his people! Opportunity, a beautiful double-edged sword!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian believed that Justice would definitely be able to handle that bunch of riff-raff from Above Heavens, and most likely they would not be able to kill him in a short period of time. During this time he should take the chance to clean his place a little! A cruel smile hung on his face as intense bloodlust started to reek from his body!</p><br/><p>He cast a meaningful glance towards Li Xue, before the two of them floated upwards, shooting deep into the forest!</p><br/><p>Before this, the two of them were completely stationary, holding even their breaths, as though they had merged into the tree. While Justice\u2019s spiritual sense was abnormally astute, he still would not be able to tell them apart. However, the moment they moved, Justice was immediately able to sense their presence. Only then did he realize that his targets had actually been unnoticed audience members the whole time. He couldn\u2019t help but shout, \u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?!\u201d before preparing to rush over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere do you think you\u2019re going?!\u201d A similar shout was heard before a dazzling sword beam flashed over. Behind it was a sarcastic smile of Meng JueChen as he ridiculed, \u201cThe magnificent Martial Order Medallion owner, aren\u2019t you known as the number one expert under heavens, doing only what you say, and undefeated throughout the world? Are you trying to renege on our battle now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cold laughter immediately rang out from all the other fourteen people simultaneously. They in fact thought that Justice really intended to escape, that he was afraid of them! As such, their courage soared, and they readied their swords, preparing to engage.</p><br/><p>\u201cA bunch of idiots! Indeed it\u2019s true, good advice falls on deaf ears. Damned ghosts!\u201d Justice could only watch as the two of them entered the forest. His temper soared to new heights as he spoke, \u201cSince you guys really seek death, I\u2019ll give it to you!\u201d It had taken him much effort to finally locate that brat\u2019s whereabouts, but now his plan of pursuing him was being foiled in front of his eyes. How would he feel?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re the damned ghost. Fifteen of us joining hands will be enough to end your life. You don\u2019t even possess the same strength as our Ancestor Yin that year after all!\u201d Meng JueChen laughed as his sword flashed dangerously.</p><br/><p>Justice\u2019s eyes gleamed as he let out a mocking laughter, \u201cYin JueKong? So what if it\u2019s him, he had merely entered the large success of the XianTian realm. Let me tell you something. I\u2019m sure all of you still remember your senior of that year, named Xu RuoMeng right, although I feel that he should have changed his name to mean dashed dreams instead! 1 He had also entered the large success stage of the XianTiam realm, definitely not below that of Yin JueKong! But do you know what was his ending?</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Meng is brimming with talent, with fearsome achievements. He has never been defeated before, and could be considered the top expert in our sect, comparable to Ancestor Yin back then! He has entered into a life-death cultivation, but he should be the real number one expert instead!\u201d A haughty smile was plastered on Meng JueChen\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cClosed up?! Indeed, calling you an idiot was right. Has anyone even gone to check on him? That year, when Xu RuoMeng challenged the various experts from the Heavenly Star Continent, he indeed never suffered from a defeat, but unfortunately, he came across me in the end! Right now, I\u2019m afraid the person you deem as the top expert in your sect has already become a bunch of ashes, hahaha!\u201d Justice calmly threw out a bomb as though he was spouting some mysterious principles!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 utter rubbish! Elder Meng could achieve complete victory even when against the various forces of the Heavenly Star Continent, and has closed up to make further progress in his cultivation!\u201d Meng JueChen\u2019s face turned ashen as he severely rebutted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said it before, that under my hands, there will not be any injuries, and this includes your undefeated elder Meng! However, you need not be too sad, because very soon, I\u2019ll too send you guys down to accompany your Elder Meng!\u201d A boundless killing intent spread out from Justice in an instant, and with a light shout, his body avoided a sword thrust towards him as he pulled his sword out from his sheath and rushed forward!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stared at the far distance which NanGong TianLong and his group had retreated to, speeding with all his might in that direction. Following closely by him was naturally the mysterious girl Li Xue. While Ling Tian\u2019s movement techniques were displayed at ninety percent of his maximum strength, the lass was surprisingly able to keep up!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re thinking of killing them?\u201d Li Xue slightly knitted her brows, a cold light flashing through her eyes. Even while sticking close to Ling Tian, she still had the breath to chat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I just allow them to attempt to kill me without retaliating? Am I not allowed to go after them as well?\u201d The killing aura that Ling Tian had suppressed for a long time finally flared up again as he spoke. The aura suffused across the whole area, leading the surrounding birds to fly up in fright, roaming around the air above him. Avian creatures had always been sensitive to such killing intent, far more than humans themselves!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Ling Tian could minutely sense that a strong pressure had suddenly burst out behind him, blending into his killing intent and harmonizing within, increasing its might by a notch!</p><br/><p>Turning his head back to observe, he only saw the masked face of Li Xue, with a pair of crystal clear pupils full of killing intent. She replied, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then count me in.\u201d</p><br/><p>A sense of warmth suffused in Ling Tian\u2019s heart, as he felt a feeling of meeting someone whom he had not met for a long time, causing him to let out a smile. However, her next sentence almost caused Ling Tian to fall off from the sky.</p><br/><p>Li Xue slowly sighed and spoke, \u201cActually, I haven\u2019t killed anyone for sixteen years!\u201d There was a hint of reminiscence hidden deep within her voice.</p><br/><p>What an arrogant sentence! Ling Tian staggered and almost fell headfirst!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

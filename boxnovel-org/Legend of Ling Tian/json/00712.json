He immediately ordered, \u201cEveryone get on your horses. Rush at full speed! We will not take any breaks in between!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Jian already started besieging the city yesterday?\u201d Li Xue asked with a dull expression. From Ling Tian\u2019s expression, she could already tell.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Ling Jian!\u201d Ling Tian sighed with anger, \u201cAfter this battle is over, I must definitely punish him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue let out a smile and said, \u201cLing Jian is doing this for you! It can\u2019t be that you don\u2019t understand what he is thinking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian snorted twice and glared at Li Xue, \u201cThat is the lives of a few hundred thousand soldiers! Which one of them isn\u2019t precious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue thought to herself silently, If it was me, I would probably do the same as Ling Jian! I would rather the entire world die or use my life in exchange than to allow any harm to come to you! It would be worth it for me to sacrifice everything for you. As long as you can live on well, what is the world worth?</p><br/><p>While Li Xue didn\u2019t say those words, Ling Tian could obviously see it in her eyes. His heart turned warm and he tapped Li Xue on the shoulders while saying warmly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry!\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, after hearing Ling Tian\u2019s words, Li Xue\u2019s racing heart suddenly slowed down. Feeling Ling Tian\u2019s immense confidence, her heart also settled down and she let out a smile.</p><br/><p>Looking up at the darkening sky, Ling Tian let out a sigh, \u201cIt is impossible for the entire army to rush over in time. We need to abandon the majority of our soldiers and rush over at full speed if we want to reach there before noon! If we arrive late, there will be a large number of fatalities!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue nodded her head and smiled, \u201cIf not for your strict order, Ling Jian wouldn\u2019t have been able to endure up until now. It is already a feat for him to endure up until now. If it were me, I would have taken action by now!\u201d</p><br/><p>After making some simple arrangements, Ling Tian and Li Xue left the main army and sped forward.</p><br/><p>Despite it being deep into the night, Bright Jade City was still filled with the flames of battle.</p><br/><p>In the palace.</p><br/><p>A general rushed in and reported, \u201cYour Majesty, the attack of the Divine Prefecture Empire remains intense and it has never stopped since noon today. Furthermore, their attack seems to be getting more and more intense by the minute. They will probably continue their attack for the entire night. Do we have to send our reserve forces out just in case?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s expression was dark and he said after a long while, \u201cArrange it according to your suggestions! The generals of the Divine Prefecture Empire have always treasured their soldiers but their actions this time are extremely strange. For them to not bother about their losses is an extremely strange matter. Inform the various generals to defend the place to their deaths. Nothing will be allowed to go wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoger!\u201d The general bowed respectfully and walked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir attack is becoming more and more intense? It is no more than a farce. They only want to distract us with their million man army and deal us a killing blow when we least expect it. They only want to use their soldiers to surround our city and attempt to destroy our morale. It seems like the First Pavilion Head will take action tonight!\u201d Yu ManLou said slowly with killing intent in his eyes, \u201cSilent like a mountain, moving like the storm! If he takes action, it will be a big one! If not, how would he be able to kill me?! Alright, this emperor will be waiting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, you mean to say\u2026 the First Pavilion Head may assassinate you tonight?\u201d Yu ManTang asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother, you are one of the few famous military strategists in the world, you should understand that it isn\u2019t advantageous for the attacking party to continue the attack so late into the night. However, they don\u2019t seem to have any intentions to cease the attack but are increasing the intensity of their attacks instead. Second brother, don\u2019t you find this matter very strange?\u201d Yu ManLou looked at his second brother before continuing, \u201cAny oddity must have a reason! They must be trying to hide something by making such a large move! Their strange actions must be because they want to cover up another larger operation. In Bright Jade City, who else other than me would be worthy of them using a million soldiers as a feint?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother is right!\u201d Yu ManTang\u2019s eyes narrowed and his aura suddenly turned sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother.\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes turned warm, \u201cWith the First Pavilion Head taking the lead personally, there will be many experts together with him! Tonight will be a tough fight! Victory and defeat have yet to be determined. You must remember something\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang raised his head and looked at Yu ManLou. However, Yu ManLou suddenly stopped talking and looked out at the darkness. From the side view, Yu ManLou\u2019s face was filled with desolation and loneliness!</p><br/><p>A long while later, Yu ManLou let out a soft sigh and stood up from the throne. Pulling Yu ManTang\u2019s hands, he said with a heavy voice, \u201cSecond brother, all of us here understand that the thousand years of our Yu Family\u2019s glory is finished! Even if we make our final struggle, we are only stalling for time!\u201d He then waved his hands to stop Yu ManTang from talking and continued talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since I was young, I, Yu ManLou, have been filled with ambition. I swore to make my Yu Family the number one family in the world and the ruler of the entire continent! All these years, I walked forward step by step and everything went too smoothly. I even dare to say that the Yu Family under my charge was more prosperous than ever before! Thus, I also became full of ambition and felt as though there was nothing in the world that I couldn\u2019t achieve. Everything in the world was in my grasp! As such, my ambition grew bigger and bigger, completely out of control.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTen years ago, the first time our Yu Family was robbed, I sent people to follow the two stealthily. After following them until the territory of Sky Bearing, the two of them disappeared without a trace. However, I also found something very special! That was the time when Ling Tian was infamous for being a profligate son. When I found out that Ling Tian was no more than a ten-year-old boy, I began to have my doubts. Regardless of how degenerate he was, it was unlikely for his infamy to spread throughout the entire continent right? Furthermore, his infamy had spread so rapidly. As such, I became curious and after a great deal of effort, I found out that all of these rumors had originated from a gang called the Violent Wind Gang. Furthermore, this Violent Wind Gang was actually controlled by Ling Tian! At that time, I knew that Ling Tian wasn\u2019t a simple person!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian intentionally feigned weakness and ruined his reputation. When I was young, I intentionally acted in a high profile manner and bragged in order to make a good impression with my father and the elders. While Ling Tian\u2019s actions were the exact opposite of mine, his intention was the same. It can be said that we both achieved the same result with different means. At that time, with authority in my hands, I believe that I would have been able to destroy that little brat with a mere flip of my palms. However, I did not do that. Thinking back, I am both with and without regrets\u2026\u201d Yu ManLou let out a self-mocking laugh, \u201cI saw Ling Tian grow up step by step, gradually growing in strength. It felt as though I relived my days from back then again. That familiar but strange feeling is truly\u2026 indescribable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang let out a sigh. He was naturally clear concerning what Yu ManLou had been through all his life and it wasn\u2019t surprising for Yu ManLou to have such thoughts at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis brat Ling Tian, his style is extremely similar to mine and it can even be said that our actions are identical. We are both vicious and merciless, and walk down the path of violence and blood! However, he started a full ten years later than me! Despite Ling Tian\u2019s strength being relatively hidden over the past ten years, I am still aware of the majority of his forces. However, to think that we were completely unaware of the fact that the First Pavilion and Crystal Pavilion were also part of Ling Tian\u2019s forces! In other words, he had already created these organizations before I noticed him! After that, they hid entirely to ensure that they wouldn\u2019t be noticed by us. I believe that those two world-famous organizations were still extremely weak at that time. At that time, Ling Tian was only eight. He was only eight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEight?! He was only eight?!\u201d Yu ManTang was dumbfounded and a bomb seemed to have gone off in his head.</p><br/><p>An eight-year-old child was capable of creating the legendary First Pavilion and Crystal Pavilion? The number one assassination and information organizations?! If not for big brother\u2019s words, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it! Am I actually not dreaming?! Yu ManTang shook his head hard.</p><br/><p>He is truly a demonic talent!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Northern Wei used their Martial Order Medallion to invite Justice to kill Ling Tian, Ling Tian\u2019s wings were already fully grown! However, I still thought that Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve much regardless of how talented he was with only a few years of hard work! Could his achievements measure up to the thousand years of accumulation of our Yu Family? Furthermore, everything went too well at that time and unknowingly, I became overly arrogant. I had hoped for a worthy opponent to make my life more exciting. At the very least, it wouldn\u2019t be too boring and lonely\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou let out a bitter laugh. \u201cStep by step, I became the monarch I am today from the little child I was in the past! At the same time, I trapped all the members of my Yu Family here! I truly lost the entire game because of a single wrong step. The most frightening organization under Ling Tian isn\u2019t the First Pavilion but the even more mysterious Crystal Pavilion! While the strength of the First Pavilion is frightening, they are no more than a sharp blade. However, the intelligence of the Crystal Pavilion is capable of burying an entire million man army! The Crystal Pavilion has been hidden for almost ten years and it has yet to surface in the world. If not for us coincidentally finding out that the Crystal Pavilion belonged to Ling Tian, we wouldn\u2019t have realized that all the information that we paid good money to buy from the Crystal Pavilion was filled with 90% truth and 10% lies! However, this 10% of lies was sufficient to destroy our Yu Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s done is done and we have made far too many mistakes when dealing with an opponent like Ling Tian! It isn\u2019t surprising for us to lose! I have regrets but do not have any regrets!\u201d Yu ManTian\u2019s eagle-eyes glowed with splendor, \u201cSecond brother, what I want to say today is that you have to survive no matter what and pass down our Yu Family\u2019s bloodline! As long as our Yu Family\u2019s bloodline can be passed down, even in death, I will be able to face our ancestors in the afterlife!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother!!!\u201d Yu ManTang cried out anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan\u2019er is now Ling Tian\u2019s consort and with this layer of relationship, Ling Tian will not take action against you! As for me\u2026 Ling Tian would not let me off no matter what! If I die after this battle and Ling Tian remains alive, you must not take revenge! With Ling Tian\u2019s talent and his capable subordinates, the entire continent would have a hundred years of peace at the very least! Thus, in the next 200 years, you must not allow the members of our Yu Family to even think about taking revenge! This is something that must be placed into our ancestral rules! Those who defy the rule shall be executed!\u201d Yu ManLou placed his hands on Yu ManTang\u2019s shoulders and looked him in the eye, \u201cPromise me! You must live on and pass down the bloodline of our Yu Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPROMISE ME!!\u201d Yu ManLou roared with his eyes turning red.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang\u2019s knees collapsed onto the ground, \u201cBig brother! I\u2026 I promise you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou then regained his usual scholarly appearance and turned around calmly. Waving his hands, he said, \u201cYou\u2026 take your leave.\u201d He then looked up at the sky and didn\u2019t say another word.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou remained still as though he didn\u2019t hear a thing. A long while later, he added, \u201cThird brother is extremely hot-tempered and you must take good care of him!\u201d</p><br/><p>A bad premonition rose up in Yu ManTang\u2019s heart. Yu ManLou seemed to be saying his final words before his death. Yu ManTang then took his leave with a heavy heart.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou stood alone as he looked out into the darkness. All of a sudden, a resolute smile could be seen on his face as he muttered under his breath, \u201cFirst Pavilion Head, Ling Jian! Since I cannot wait for Ling Tian\u2019s arrival and your actions are so outrageous, it shall be you! With the number one assassin in the world accompanying me into the afterlife, I don\u2019t have to be afraid of being lonely! Haha!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the crown of Yu ManLou\u2019s head exploded and his hair shot up towards the sky. An azure qi could be seen flowing around his face as it slowly turned into a black qi. His originally cold eyes suddenly turned completely black and the whites of his eyes could no longer be seen. At this moment, Yu ManLou seemed to have transformed into a decomposed skeleton with two black holes at his eyes!</p><br/><p>His long hair fell back down and Yu ManLou\u2019s arms turned back to their original color. Raising his arms out, he took down his treasured sword and hung it on his waist. While his action was scholarly as usual, he no longer had his usual elegance and solemness. Instead, he was emanating an extremely strange aura!</p><br/><p>In the hall, an eerie and frightening ghastly aura exploded forth and it wouldn\u2019t be too much to call the hall a living hell!</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a single trace of life\u2026</p><br/><p>The battle along the city gates was still ongoing and countless soldiers were dropping off from the ladders and being thrown off the city gates. The city gate was dyed red with blood and the foot of the city gate had a mountain of corpses.</p><br/><p>What a miserable battle!</p><br/><p>In front of the Divine Prefecture Empire\u2019s marshal tent, Xiao FengYang, XiMen Sa, Shen RuHu and DongFang JingLei frowned as they looked at the miserable battlefield. None of them could imagine that this single city was powerful enough to withstand the endless attack of a million men army for a full five days! In the past five days, the number of casualties of their army was also stunning!</p><br/><p>The Yu Family\u2019s army was truly made up of elites!</p><br/><p>Without a single sound, 45 black ghostly figures appeared in front of everyone and walked over slowly. They were clad completely in black and had a black scabbard on their backs. With the 45 of them walking together, the entire night sky seemed to have turned colder than before.</p><br/><p>The person in the lead was the Divine Sword Duke of the Divine Prefecture Empire, Ling Jian. The others behind him were his brothers who had the surname Ling.</p><br/><p>Apart from Ling Chen and Ling Jian, Ling Tian had given the surname Ling to a total of 56 individuals. Apart from the four in charge of intelligence, five in Heavenly Star, Ling Fifty who was back in Sky Bearing and XiMen Sa, the others were all present!</p><br/><p>The steps of the 45 individuals were in complete unison and their indomitable aura exploded forth! It covered the heavens and the earth and a large whirlwind was stirred from their aura!</p><br/><p>XiMen Sa\u2019s gaze began to burn as he looked at Ling Jian and the others, hating the fact that he couldn\u2019t jump into battle together with them! However, he could not! He had the responsibility of supervising the army at this place!</p><br/><p>After looking at all of his brothers in the eyes, Ling Jian turned around and commanded coldly, \u201cThe operation tonight is the most dangerous one that we have ever faced! Young noble saved us from peril and not only did he bring us up, he even taught us martial arts that are far superior to any martial arts in the world! Today is the time for us to repay our young noble\u2019s kindness! We are only allowed to succeed and not allowed to fail! Even if only a single one of us is left, we must kill Yu ManLou under our sword! Do all of you understand?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe understand! Kill Yu ManLou! Only success, no failure! We will succeed even if only a single person is left!\u201d The 44 others replied in unison. While their voice wasn\u2019t loud, the killing intent in their voice was sufficient to make one\u2019s hair stand up!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian nodded in satisfaction, \u201cThe 45 of us will be split into six groups of seven people. Ling Feng, Ling Yun, Ling Lei, Ling Dian, Ling Chi and I will each lead a group. We will take action separately and meet up in the imperial palace of the Yu Family! Forty-seven, Forty-eight and Forty-nine are to move independently and support any group in need!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian walked forward slowly to the front of the troops and stared at each and every one of his brothers as though he wanted to imprint the faces of his brothers into their hearts. After this mission tonight, he may not be able to see them again!</p><br/><p>A long while later, Ling Jian waved his hands and said, \u201cSet off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Forty-five of them put on a black mask and split up into six different groups. The next instant, the six groups shot forward like six black arrows and disappeared into the darkness!</p><br/><p>XiMen Sa\u2019s eyes turned red and he hopped onto his warhorse. Waving a command flag, he roared, \u201cSound the drums! Attack! The first person to charge into Bright Jade City will be awarded 10,000 taels of gold and the position of general! I, Ling Thirty, will make this promise on behalf of the empire!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Despite it being late into the night, the soldiers of the Divine Prefecture Empire who had already battled for an entire day charged crazily towards Bright Jade City as though they were on stimulates. This attack was obviously different from the previous few attacks. Regardless of the generals or soldiers, they all charged forward without a concern for their lives as though they weren\u2019t afraid of death!</p><br/><p>Arrows landed like rain and the soldiers attacked like a tsunami!</p><br/><p>The battle cry of the soldiers shook the entire world!</p><br/><p>Forty-five black figures charged up the ladder as though it was flat ground. After killing a few enemy soldiers who were in their way, they quickly disappeared as though they had never appeared before.</p><br/><p>On top of Bright Jade City\u2019s gates, an extremely bright and colorful fire arrow shot into the sky and exploded with splendor.</p><br/><p>In the imperial city, the warning drums that indicated danger also sounded.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s eagle eyes were fixed on the bright fireworks in the sky and his right hand was placed on the hilt of his sword. The moment had finally arrived\u2026</p><br/><p>Not too far away from Bright Jade City, two figures shot over like shooting stars towards the city. Even if Yu ManLou was present, he would find this speed extremely frightening.</p><br/><p>At the north of Bright Jade City, a human figure appeared together with a stunning rainbow. Before the guards could even react, the figure disappeared swiftly.</p><br/><p>Right when Ling Chi and the other six entered the imperial palace, ten plus individuals appeared in front of them and blocked their way. Eight were middle-aged men and three were elders. Their expressions were solemn as they waited with their guard up, \u201cAssassins of the First Pavilion? Moon Climbing Star Picking Pavilion of the Yu Family has been awaiting your arrival!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chi\u2019s pupils narrowed and he did not hesitate in the slightest. Waving his hands, he ordered, \u201cKill!\u201d Pouncing forward, he brandished his sword and had easily destroyed two of his opponents\u2019 weapons.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Feng led his six brothers and carefully avoided all the patrols. They were already near the walls of the imperial palace and would arrive at the palace after flipping over the wall in front of them!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, an eerie voice could be heard, \u201cFirst Pavilion, what incredible fame. However, all of you don\u2019t seem to be much? Martial Pointer Pavilion of the Yu Family has been waiting for a long time\u2026\u201d As this voice sounded, ten plus figures appeared on top of the walls of the imperial palace.</p><br/><p>Ling Yun, Ling Lei, Ling Dian, and the others had also met with the ambush of the Yu Family\u2019s Unreturnable Pavilion, Shadowless Pavilion, and Ruler Tower!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s group proceeded the fastest and took care of all the soldiers who blocked their way with lightning-fast speed. When he was nearing the palace, he adopted the most straight forward possible method and charged over like a powerful gust of wind. Before the enemy army could even react, they had charged straight into the palace. However, they all received the greatest resistance because of that!</p><br/><p>The Yu Family\u2019s Colliding Heaven Pavilion and White Jade Hall sent out their strongest experts to stop Ling Jian and others. As they engaged Ling Jian and the others in an intense battle, six battles broke out within Bright Jade City!</p><br/><p>The locations of all six battles were right outside the Yu Family\u2019s imperial palace! Just a single wall away.</p><br/><p>An aristocratic family with a thousand years of foundation sent out the strongest force they could muster to clash with the First Pavilion that was currently at its strongest! It was like a meteor crashing to earth. Countless of once-in-a-lifetime battles could be witnessed between experts all over the city!</p><br/><p>Sword qi shot towards the sky! Killing intent burst forth in all directions!</p><br/><p>The family head of the Yu Family, Yu ManLou, had yet to appear!</p><br/><p>Before today, many of the Yu Family experts were completely indifferent towards the fame of the Yu Family. They all felt that the fame of the First Pavilion was undeserved and they were only monkeys ruling the mountain with the absence of the tigers! But after exchanging blows with the First Pavilion today, they finally understood how powerful the First Pavilion was!</p><br/><p>Every single one of these black-robed men had the strength close to a gold jade level expert of the Yu Family! There were a few who had strength superior to that! The most frightening thing was the bizarre movement techniques of these assassins and their extremely vicious swordplay. All the Yu Family experts could not help but suffer a loss after a single exchange!</p><br/><p>The swordplay of these assassins was even more exquisite than the Yu Family\u2019s swordplay that had gone through a thousand years of refinement!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian became more and more excited as he killed and felt as though this was the most exciting battle he had to date. All of a sudden, he let out a long roar and his killing intent shot to the sky. His long sword became like a soaring flood dragon, mystical and unfathomable. Ling Jian felt as though his mental state had entered an extremely mystical realm and his entire sword seemed to be part of his body and he could control it as though it was his limbs. In this extremely cruel and miserable battle, Ling Jian had succeeded in making a breakthrough that he had dreamed of all his life!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian, who had advanced his cultivation, burst out into laughter and his figure shot into the air with a brilliant ball of sword light. Wherever he went, dismembered limbs and miserable shrieks would accompany him!</p><br/><p>In the dark, an individual stood in mid-air and observed the battle calmly. Upon noticing Ling Jian\u2019s breakthrough, his eyes glowed with splendor and he mumbled, \u201cAnother one. Not bad, not bad. I will not be lonely!\u201d He then looked towards the imperial palace and grumbled, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t Yu ManLou taking action? When will he stop being a turtle?\u201d</p><br/><p>As though answering to his pleas, a brilliant sword light shot out from the imperial palace and shot towards Ling Jian\u2019s back like lightning.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s man and sword as one technique had massacred almost all of the Yu Family experts present and Ling Jian finally landed on the ground with excitement in his heart. If it was before his breakthrough, his inner qi would have probably been sapped dry after unleashing such an attack. But this time, he still had more than one-third of his inner qi left! As long as he adjusted his inner qi slightly, he would be able to recover up to 60% of his inner qi quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble is right. A reserved sword qi is indeed a higher realm than being one with the sword! I can unleash and retract my sword qi at will and not waste a single bit of it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian stood proudly with dismembered body parts of the Yu Family all around him. As his sword pointed down, the fresh blood of his prey dripped gently down onto the ground\u2026</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Ling Jian suddenly felt extreme danger approaching him! Almost instinctively, Ling Jian brandished his sword and dodged to the side!</p><br/><p>With a loud clanging sound, Ling Jian felt a powerful inner qi being transmitted from his sword and the remaining inner qi in his body being completely suppressed. His body stumbled backward and a large mouthful of blood was spat out from his mouth!</p><br/><p>The person who ambushed him did not stop there and his sword shot towards the falling Ling Jian, hoping to seal Ling Jian\u2019s fate with a single sword!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s body rolled on the ground and a silver glow shot out from his sword to protect him. Being caught off guard, he was almost unable to withstand the incoming attacks.</p><br/><p>The attacker had a righteous face and scholarly appearance. His beard fluttered in the wind and he was clad in yellow robes. He was the emperor of the Yu Family: Yu ManLou! This monarch of an empire had actually chosen to ambush someone from the back!</p><br/><p>The three brothers behind Ling Jian stabbed out their swords at the same time and managed to block Yu ManLou\u2019s frightening attack just in time. However, the force of Yu ManLou\u2019s attack sent them flying and the three of them knelt on the ground with blood flowing out from all seven orifices!</p><br/><p>Two other swords glowed and stabbed down mercilessly towards Yu ManLou\u2019s back!</p><br/><p>From a few other directions, miserable shrieks could be heard all around. Ling Feng\u2019s hair was in a complete mess and he was the first to appear on the walls of the palace. Following that, Ling Feng appeared with his body drenched in blood. The moment they appeared on the walls of the palace, they immediately shot down towards Yu ManLou! From the different directions, black-robed individuals appeared and sprinted over at full speed!</p><br/><p>The numerous Yu Family guards and experts who were surrounding the experts of the First Pavilion charged forward with exasperation.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a loud and tyrannical roar sounded. Following that, a cry like a phoenix followed and the entire Bright Jade City was covered with the two roars. While it wasn\u2019t too loud, all the soldiers fighting and civilians of the city could hear it clearly!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou forced the three people behind him back with a single sword and could no longer be bothered with chasing after Ling Jian. He hurriedly retracted his sword and retreated into the guards of the Yu Family. He then looked at the direction by which the roar came from with a smile that didn\u2019t seem like a smile and a malevolent pair of eyes! Ling Tian, you have personally arrived!</p><br/><p>Following the two roars, two figures descended on the walls of the imperial palace like two celestial beings. One was a suave young man and the other a ravishing beauty!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian and Li Xue!</p><br/><p>They have finally arrived!</p><br/><p>\u201cLong live the Majesty!\u201d Ling Chi let out a roar and jumped up in excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cLong live the Majesty! Long live the Majesty! \u2026\u201d Following Ling Chi\u2019s roar, the army of the Divine Prefecture Empire seemed to be jolted awake and they roared out in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Family Head of the Yu Family, the first emperor of the empire is a despicable scum who ambushes people from their backs!\u201d A trace of blood could be seen at the corner of Ling Jian\u2019s lips as he mocked. He then retracted his sword which was pointed out and looked towards Ling Tian with a burning gaze.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian walked over slowly with a calm and easygoing expression. After checking on the injuries of Ling Jian and the others, he turned around slowly and looked at Yu ManLou.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s voice was agitated and filled with worry, \u201cYoung noble!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMove back! I will settle scores with you after this!\u201d Ling Jian opened his mouth as though he wanted to say something before lowering his head.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at Yu ManLou and their gazes clashed! The two monarchs of the continent were meeting again in this life or death moment!</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s face was frosty and she got into a stance ready for attack. She stood on Ling Tian\u2019s left and her hand was on the hilt of her sword. Ling Jian took a step forward and stood by Ling Tian\u2019s right with his eyes locked on Yu ManLou\u2019s hands!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou shook his head and laughed. With a crisp voice, he said, \u201cLing Tian, Emperor Ling. It has been a long time since we last met ever since our previous parting in Bright Jade. Emperor Ling now has millions of miles of territory and a million soldiers under your charge. Your prestige has never been seen before since the ancient times and it is truly worthy of celebration!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled and replied, \u201cIt has been a long time since we last met and Family Head Yu\u2019s elegance is just like before. However, Family Head probably never imagined that our meeting would be such a scene.\u201d Ling Tian still called Yu ManLou \u2018Family Head\u2019 and obviously didn\u2019t acknowledge his status as an emperor.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou wasn\u2019t stirred by Ling Tian\u2019s words and replied with a soft sigh, \u201cYou\u2019re right, I truly didn\u2019t expect this. However, I do not understand how you defeated my million-man army. While I have already been defeated, I know that you must have done something on the sly. Otherwise, I would not have been defeated so quickly! I pride myself on my wisdom but I truly do not know what despicable means emperor Ling used!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at him and suddenly smiled, \u201cFamily Head Yu, let me introduce someone to you. You will understand everything after seeing him.\u201d He then clapped his hands.</p><br/><p>A human figure then appeared on the city walls and walked towards Yu ManLou.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiMen Sa?!\u201d Even if a living celestial being was in front of him, Yu ManLou wouldn\u2019t be so shocked! It was truly too shocking! It was XiMen Sa! The young general who he thought of so highly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head Yu, XiMen Sa is only this subordinate\u2019s alias. This subordinate\u2019s surname is Ling and I am called Ling Thirty. From today on, there won\u2019t be a XiMen Sa in the world. Only Ling Thirty!\u201d Ling Thirty smiled and cupped his fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiMen Sa, Ling Thirty!\u201d At that moment, Yu ManLou understood everything! He felt his blood boiling and his eyes dimming. He had almost fainted from anger!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Yu ManLou stood a step forward and roared, \u201cLing Tian, we once made a bet with the entire world as the stakes. It is now time for us to fulfill the bet! Do you dare to have a life or death battle with me? The winner will be crowned and loser vilified. The fate of the world will be decided with a single battle! How about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDream on!\u201d Before Ling Tian said anything, Ling Jian interrupted, \u201cThere is no need to talk about fighting a fair battle with a despicable person like you! Brothers, attack together and dice him into pieces!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

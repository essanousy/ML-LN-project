Do you think that this matter is over just because you say that you don\u2019t dare to?! I haven\u2019t settled this score with you yet.\u201d Li Xue\u2019s face turned cold and she looked at Ling Tian with an unfriendly expression, \u201cYou actually dare to treat me with such disrespect and think that matters would be over with just a single \u2018I don\u2019t dare to\u2019? Don\u2019t you want to say something else? If I let you give me an explanation, will Young Noble Ling be able to give me a good explanation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow am I being disrespectful?\u201d Ling Tian knew that it was impossible for him to wiggle out of this situation and could only twist logic, \u201cIt is only proper for an older brother to teach his disobedient younger sister a lesson! Rotten lass, do you still want to get beaten?\u201d As Ling Tian said that, he swung his fists ferociously.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh, who is your little sister? You shameless fellow!\u201d Li Xue wasn\u2019t afraid of Ling Tian the slightest and sneered, \u201cHow is this Miss your little sister? We have all been born into a new world already. My surname is Li while yours is Ling! Don\u2019t try to randomly claim kinship! Is this young miss correct? Hmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 what do you mean by this?\u201d Ling Tian said with exasperation. He could tell that this lass was not going to let go of him today.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! In Western Han, you did not seek this Miss\u2019s agreement and took a peek at my pure body. Even if we were biological siblings, how can an older brother look at his younger sister\u2019s pure body?\u201d Li Xue\u2019s face turned red but she continued, \u201cWhen we were in Northern Wei, you also did not avoid the taboos between men and women. Today, you went even further and actually started smacking me?! Speak, just what do you want?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s eyes turned red and she started sobbing, \u201cI am also a pure and chaste young lady. If you repeatedly act in such a manner, how am I going to continue living? Why is my life so miserable!\u201d As she finished, tears were already streaming down her cheeks.</p><br/><p>She was indeed someone of the 21st century. If it was anyone else in this world, it would be impossible for her to speak these words so fluently. Even if these words would leave her mouth, she would definitely be embarrassed to death. However, Li Xue was actually able to spout these words without pausing for a single moment and did not even forget to put up a brilliant show. She had even lamented about how bitter her life was and was obviously forcing Ling Tian to give in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaiz\u2026 haiz!\u201d Ling Tian stomped his feet and he glared at Li Xue, \u201cBig sister\u2026 aren\u2019t your tears too readily available? They can be summoned whenever you want? How is your life miserable? How did I take a peek at your pure body? When we were traveling together, I also allowed you to take a look at my body as you wished! Go and continue lying to yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh! Who would believe you? I don\u2019t care! You have to take responsibility for this matter! You must, you must, you must!\u201d Li Xue growled ferociously.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy goodness!\u201d Ling Tian scratched his head and said with a headache, \u201cBig sister, have you forgotten already? The two of us are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre what?\u201d Li Xue wiped her tears dry and grunted, \u201cEven in our previous life, we only had the same surname and belonged to the same sect. As for blood ties, we would probably have to go eight generations back before we could find some blood ties. Even within our family, there are more than one or two couples with similar \u2018blood ties\u2019 to ours! Just like Ling ZhenTing and Ling MengYun, aren\u2019t they three generations closer as compared to us? Ling MengYun had to call Ling ZhenTing uncle but they were still married in the end! You are also aware that as long as two individuals are separated by three generations, they cannot be considered to have any ties between them! We were all just forced to live in a rotten big yard together. Even if we don\u2019t talk about our previous life, in this current life of ours, you are young noble Ling Tian of the Ling Family while I am the villager Li Xue. With just this point alone, there aren\u2019t any blood ties between us. What is considered impossible between us and what are you still wary about? Speak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt like pulling his hair out and he paced about in a crazed manner, \u201cThat\u2019s different! How can they be the same as us? We\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s face turned pale and tears welled up in her eyes, \u201cI knew that you were still filled with hatred towards me. You still hate me and have not truly forgiven me! Even after I chased after you to this world, you have not forgiven me yet. Am I right? Thus, you can marry all the women in the world except for me. Am I right? You are taking revenge on me! You just want me to spend my life in loneliness, am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue inched nearer and nearer to Ling Tian and tears continued flowing down her cheeks with a crazed stubbornness in her eyes, \u201cLing Tian, you pretentious gentleman! On one hand, you claim that I am your younger sister but on another hand, you are performing the acts of a male-female relationship with me. After all these, you use the best excuse of us being siblings. Hahahaha\u2026 so this is how you are going to take your revenge on me! Am I right? Say something! Why aren\u2019t you saying anything?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! It isn\u2019t like that!\u201d Ling Tian was forced into retreat and he finally let out a roar. His eyes were filled with craziness as though he was an injured beast, \u201cEver since I met you, I have not hated you any longer. You know that clearly in your heart but you still chose to use this matter to force me? WHY?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are asking me why?! Why don\u2019t you tell me why?! I am still a woman and I need a broad chest to lean on. What should I do?!\u201d Li Xue patted herself on the chest and a fuzzy look could be seen in her eyes, \u201cLing Tian, you are a man who transmigrated into this world. It wouldn\u2019t matter who you choose to marry! In the three continents, all the countless beauties are waiting to be chosen and waiting to be attracted to you! Because of your peerless talents and unparalleled martial arts! To the women of this generation, you are like the most potent poison! You can play with the universe in your palm with your knowledge and can be said to be omnipotent. No one would be able to imagine that the knowledge that you have displayed is only comparable to a college student! However, you have actually created a storm in this world. Thus, you have succeeded!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what about me? I am different from you! Even if I know more than you and am more knowledgeable than you, what is the use of all my knowledge? I am still a woman after all! In terms of scholarly or martial arts, in this foreign world, apart from you Ling Tian, who else in our generation will be able to surpass me? What other man in the world would be capable of attracting me? Who else would be worthy of me marrying him? Do you think that there would be such an individual in this world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shook his head bitterly without replying. With Li Xue\u2019s conditions, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone in the world capable of attracting her. In terms of knowledge, there wasn\u2019t a single person! In terms of martial arts, only a few old fellows in the world would be comparable to her. As for winning against her with confidence, only Justice would be capable of doing so.</p><br/><p>While Justice\u2019s age wasn\u2019t known, he definitely wouldn\u2019t be too young. Furthermore, even if Justice\u2019s age was similar to Li Xue, she definitely wouldn\u2019t like him.</p><br/><p>Because there was Ling Tian as a reference after all!</p><br/><p>How would she be able to find someone more outstanding than Ling Tian?!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian never imagined that a few casual smacks would create such huge trouble for him!</p><br/><p>In fact, these few smacks of Ling Tian were only a stimulus to light the gunpowder between the two of them!</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you know why I framed you back then? You never asked me this question before!\u201d Li Xue said depressedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy you would frame me?\u201d Ling Tian was taken aback for a moment before laughing bitterly, \u201cThis matter happened so long ago and we are no longer in the same world any longer. What is the point of mentioning this matter? It is meaningless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue ignored Ling Tian and continued, \u201cI must say it because I hated you! I really hated you! We grew up together since we were young and my body was always extremely weak when I was little. Do you remember? Every time we went out to play, you would always take good care of me. Do you remember? No one else would worry about me but you. Do you remember all of this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since I was young, I loved to be around you. Do you remember that when I grew older, I became more beautiful and the others also began playing with me? Every time I was with you, I would wear the most beautiful dress that I had and would comb my hair for a long time because I wanted you to see the most beautiful me. However, you were like some crazy maniac. The more dressed up I was, the more you ignored me. Every time I went out, I would be the prettiest one with everyone else gathering around me. However, you became further and further away from me! Why?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt his heart shake. Thinking back about the past, he muttered under his breath, \u201cAt that time, I always thought that you were too vain\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s eyes widened and she looked at Ling Tian with disbelief. After a long while, she let out a bitter laugh, \u201cI see. So I was wrong, I was wrong\u2026 Your parents died when you were young and you had no one to care for you. The family didn\u2019t give you much money and you did not have any beautiful clothes to wear. Your lifestyle had always been frugal and you naturally couldn\u2019t stand my extravagance. No wonder! Why was I so foolish back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe more you ignored me, the more I became anxious. I didn\u2019t know what I did wrong and could only think of all the possible methods to appear in front of you and attract your attention. I would even act unreasonably just so you would accompany me for a longer period of time. However, you ended up ignoring me even more and so I scolded you and wanted to beat you up. However, you did not retort a single word or fight back against me. Do you know that I cried for a full three days after I returned?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree days later, I wanted to find you to apologize. However, I couldn\u2019t find you and found out after asking that the family had sent you on a mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom then on, the time that you spent in the family became less and less. Do you remember, you were 14 then, right? However, do you remember who would meet you first when you returned? I would always be the first! Do you remember?\u201d Tears streamed down Li Xue\u2019s eyes, \u201cI would always rush out with joy to meet you and to receive you but your eyes would always be filled with coldness or even disdain. At the very end, it was even filled with hatred, extreme hatred! Every time you looked at me, you would escape as though you had seen a ghost. I didn\u2019t even have a chance to speak with you! I don\u2019t understand and do not know what I did wrong! Was it wrong for me to like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did I go wrong?!\u201d Li Xue asked again before diving into the pillow and bawling her eyes out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese days carried on for more than three years! A full 1198 days! At that time, the family decided about my marriage. I was truly anxious, anxious to the point I wanted to die! At that time, I went to find you and wanted you to take me away or give me an idea. However, do you remember what you did?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI escaped secretly and found you at Luoyang. However, you did not even give me a chance to say anything, turning around to leave immediately! At that time, I could not keep up with your speed and we fought for the first time. At that time, you were far stronger than me and you injured me. After injuring me, you left immediately without saying a thing!! I waited a full day and night in the snow! A full day and night!! Did you know?! Ling Tian?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was during that day where my heart turned completely cold.\u201d Li Xue wiped off her tears and continued as though she was narrating someone else\u2019s story. \u201cHowever, I didn\u2019t want to give up and I wasn\u2019t willing to marry someone else. When you returned, I secretly put an aphrodisiac into your drink. Ling Tian, I loved you. Even if I couldn\u2019t marry you, I wanted to give my purity to you! However, you actually scolded me for being shameless. Your words were extremely vicious\u2026 Do you know what you said back then? You scolded me for being a shameless bitch! You said that I wasn\u2019t much better than a prostitute!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian broke out in cold sweat and his face contorted! He could naturally remember what he said back then. Now that he recalled what he said, he had the urge to bang his head against the wall!</p><br/><p>Why was he so foolish back then? However, things were just so coincidental. How would he know the truth behind the matter?!</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that day, I fell extremely ill! I also truly understood what hopelessness meant. For a long time after that, I was filled with hatred towards you! I hated you to the bones! I hated you to the point I wanted your death! Do you know how scary a woman\u2019s hatred is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat day, Ling Chao and the rest sought me out for a discussion about framing you. Without a second thought, I immediately agreed with them! At that time, I hated you far too much and I wanted misfortune to fall on you! I wanted you to be taught a lesson! Ling Tian, that was truly how I felt back then. Was I very childish?!\u201d Li Xue smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter framing you, I began fantasizing happily about how well I would treat you after seeing you and how I can let you know about my love for you. I childishly thought that they would only beat you up and lock you up for a while. I even thought that you wouldn\u2019t need to go out and risk your life after this and could accompany me at home. I even fantasized about how I should explain matters to you and what excuses I should come up with. However, I never imagined that when I saw you again, they had already transformed you into such a state! They had actually snapped off your tendons and crippled your inner core, transforming you into a complete trash. When I saw the vicious look in your eyes, I immediately fainted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian fell into a daze as he recalled his past life, \u201cI thought, I thought\u2026 I thought that you were feigning pity and wanted to harm me\u2026\u201d Thinking about the cold-blooded gazes and heartless actions of his family members and the young lady by the door who suddenly fainted\u2026 Ling Tian let out a mournful groan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly at that time did I know how much misery I had caused you! After that, I fell sick for a long time and had countless nightmares. I lost all my appetite and became extremely listless. When I tried finding you again, you had already disappeared. Thus, I sneakily went out to find you and saw\u2026 saw that you were picking up leaves on the ground. Seeing how you had to sleep on the streets, I no longer had the face to meet you. I could only secretly let you pick up some money and secretly send you some food. However, I did not dare to let you know that it was my doing. However, you thought that it was Ling Meng\u2019er who was helping you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI may be the only one who knows that Meng\u2019er helped you. I believe that I am the only one who would pay attention to a trash like you. At that time, I also thought that this was for the better. If you knew that I was the one who helped you, with your temper you would probably rather starve to death than accept my aid. Ling Meng\u2019er had only aided you once back then. How would she ever notice your existence? However, this also gave me the chance to pose as Ling Meng\u2019er to take care of you. Until once, I saw that Ling Chao and the rest beating you up. Only then did I remember that they were the ones who wanted me to harm you. They were the true culprits! I wanted to take revenge against them! They were the ones who harmed you and harmed me! I want to make them lead a miserable life! At that time, I wasn\u2019t their match. After you fell unconscious back then, I treated your injuries and began my revenge. I almost went crazy at that time and my means were also vicious. In a single month, I disfigured all the women that they loved! I wanted them to have a taste of how it felt like for their loved ones to be harmed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter accomplishing all of this, when I went to find you again, I could no longer find you! I could no longer find you again\u2026 wuwuwu\u2026 everyone said that you died\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs such, my heart died again and I became like a lifeless corpse. When my family wanted me to marry Huang JiaYun, I agreed without the slightest bit of hesitation. Without you left in the world, there wouldn\u2019t be a difference regardless of who I married! On the day of my marriage, you suddenly appeared and brought about a gigantic explosion with you! You destroyed everything! Ah ah, looking back, that feeling was truly mystical. Can you tell me why you disappeared back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed bitterly, \u201cMeng\u2019er took me away and we planned my revenge in secret. Meng\u2019er\u2019s motive was to gain control of the Ling Family. Up until the day of your wedding, I had always thought that she was the one who took care of me all those years and I agreed to help repay her the favor. Since there wasn\u2019t any meaning for me to remain alive at that time, I decided to fulfill her wishes. Thinking about it, Meng\u2019er was definitely extremely bewildered about why I agreed to her plan so easily.\u201d Ling Tian laughed with self-mockery.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no wonder.\u201d Li Xue seemed to have come to a realization, \u201cNo wonder all of those who were close to Meng\u2019er did not come to my wedding. It turns out that she was the biggest winner of this event. The matters of the world are truly mystical. No, she truly deserves to be the biggest winner. She rendered you aid at the time when you needed it the most and I also made use of her identity to take care of you. Without her, you wouldn\u2019t have the chance to take your revenge. She deserved all of her rewards!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI originally thought that everything would be over after my death. Who would have thought that the yellow springs road truly exists and that I would meet you on there as well! And you, actually said that you had forgiven me!\u201d Li Xue\u2019s bitter expression was suddenly filled with joy and happiness, \u201cAt that time, I was overjoyed and cried by the side of the road for a while. Following that, I heard you calling out my name and running past my side. Tian\u2019ge, ever since we were 13, that was the first time you called out my name, Xue\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI had always been waiting for that day. Waiting for the day when you forgave me. After waiting for such a long time, I finally heard your forgiveness. Even if I was only a soul, I wanted to be together with you! Tian\u2019ge, do you know that I almost exploded with joy when you called my name? I finally got to see such a day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, I shouted out behind you but you didn\u2019t hear me. After you ran past me, you finally turned back to see me. After that, I saw that you wanted to run to me but were unable to do so. Then, you began spinning like a top before disappearing. I became extremely anxious but I was unable to find you. You weren\u2019t in front of me and I thought that you were behind me. However, I couldn\u2019t take a single step back and so I tried copying you by spinning on the spot. I never imagined that when I woke up, I would be in my mother\u2019s womb\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since I came into this world, I believed that you were definitely in this world as well. I really wanted to find you but I didn\u2019t dare to and was afraid. After hesitating time and time again, I decided to wait until my Divine Ice Formula was completed before going to find you. At that time, I would be able to aid you at the very least. When I was young, I had always read novels of people transmigrating and knew the large benefits a transmigrator had. I knew that you would definitely shine brightly in this world as well. So, I hid in the depths of the mountains. I was truly afraid that if I appeared in this world, I wouldn\u2019t be able to control myself and would snatch your glory. I was afraid that you wouldn\u2019t love me anymore if I did that. I was even more afraid that you weren\u2019t even in this world\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was extremely fortunate that the heavens did not give me an ugly appearance. I was also fortunate that you were truly in this world. The luckiest thing was the fact that we did not have any blood ties in this life. When I went out to pick herbs, I saw you being chased\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI originally wanted to follow after you and never reveal my identity. I wanted to gain your approval to become your wife. Even if I could only become a concubine or maid, I would be satisfied. However, you still managed to tell from my martial arts and movement techniques.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue looked at Ling Tian with love in her eyes and a tinge of resentment, \u201cBut this pig head here actually asked me to find someone else to marry! While you actually go around womanizing with so many beauties. The most infuriating thing was the fact that you asked someone like me who has no status or title to comfort your beloved woman! You you you\u2026 you are going to anger me to death! You still dared to beat me at such a spot and said that you are a bigger brother teaching your little sister a lesson\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue began wailing and dived into Ling Tian\u2019s embrace, crying out all of her grievances from both of her lifetimes.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately felt his heart surging and did not know what to feel. Looking at this beautiful lady reprimanding him while wailing, Ling Tian felt his heart aching.</p><br/><p>After missing her for a lifetime, would he still miss her again in this life? Could he have the heart to disappoint such a love for him?</p><br/><p>Since she had followed him into this world, just what should he do?</p><br/><p>Was he really going to allow her to marry someone else? Could he really bear to do so?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a long sigh as he looked at the trembling beauty in his embrace. His arms which were curled around her waist tightened slightly.</p><br/><p>Li Xue let out a soft moan and immediately felt Ling Tian\u2019s strength. Lifting her head up, she looked at Ling Tian with a burning gaze. She then stood on her tiptoes and gave Ling Tian a kiss.</p><br/><p>With their lips connecting, Ling Tian immediately felt a tinge of saltiness from Li Xue\u2019s cooling lips. That was the taste of Li Xue\u2019s tears. Ling Tian\u2019s heart clenched up and he hugged Li Xue tightly, returning her kiss crazily.</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s body trembled and she lay in Ling Tian\u2019s embrace with satisfaction. Shutting her eyes, tears silently rolled down the corner of her eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>A long while later\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a long breath and said, \u201cHow sweet.\u201d</p><br/><p>In response, Li Xue\u2019s small fists hammered twice onto his chest to signify their master\u2019s whining.</p><br/><p>Following that, Ling Tian lowered his head again\u2026</p><br/><p>After a long time that was enough to suffocate a whale\u2026</p><br/><p>Li Xue struggled free from Ling Tian\u2019s embrace with her hair in a complete mess, her face flushed red, and breathing ragged. Her two proud peaks were trembling and her eyes were in a daze. One of her hands was placed on Ling Tian\u2019s chest weakly and her face was full of happiness.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled and Li Xue could feel Ling Tian\u2019s chest trembling slightly. With her face completely red, she hammered Ling Tian twice on his chest. If Ling Jian and the rest were to see the current Li Xue, they would definitely be startled.</p><br/><p>Was this gentle and tender lass really the demoness that everyone in the Courtyard was afraid of?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled and grabbed onto Li Xue\u2019s hand and placed it in his palm. He then stroked Li Xue on the forehead and said, \u201cXue\u2019er, I am a little puzzled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s body trembled and tears rolled down like rain!</p><br/><p>Ever since the two of them met in this world, Ling Tian had never called her Xue\u2019er and had never used this name on anyone else. Take for example Xiao YanXue. Even though her pet name was called Xue\u2019er, Ling Tian had still changed it for her.</p><br/><p>Li Xue knew that even if all of the happenings of their previous life were forgotten by Ling Tian, it was still a thorn in Ling Tian\u2019s heart. A thorn which could not be plucked out. From the way he was unwilling to call her Xue\u2019er, Li Xue could tell.</p><br/><p>Now, this name which Li Xue had not heard for a long time had finally left Ling Tian\u2019s lips again. This was enough to show that this knot in Ling Tian\u2019s heart was finally untied! Ling Tian had finally accepted her!</p></div>\n</div>"}

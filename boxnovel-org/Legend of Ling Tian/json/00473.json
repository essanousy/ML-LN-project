But before the hoarse voice could say a second sentence, Ling Tian\u2019s figure drifted over like a shadow and brandished his short sword. The next moment, a line of blood could be seen on that figure\u2019s throat and he took his last breath. However, the most unexpected thing was the fact that a look of release could be seen in that figure\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s figure did not stop there. His eyes gleamed ruthlessly and his short sword was brandished another three times, taking the lives of the other three casualties. Ling Tian then noticed that on the wounds of the four individuals, blood only trickled down slowly.</p><br/><p>The spot where Ling Tian slashed was the artery on their neck. Apart from being a fatal spot on the human body, it was also the place where the blood flow was the most. The bodies of these four individuals were obviously seriously injured and had an excessive loss of blood. Even before Ling Tian\u2019s arrival, these four individuals were no more than four half-dead corpses!</p><br/><p>All four of them were leading a life worse than death!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but think about the look of release in the first man\u2019s eyes and let out a heavy sigh. Once a person loses control of his choice to live or die and when death could be considered an extravagant hope, while Ling Tian\u2019s actions could be considered cruel, they could also be considered a form of release for them.</p><br/><p>A faint bloody smell emanated in the darkness and Ling Tian stood silently in the room and counted his breaths. Ling Tian had killed far too many people in both this and his previous life. It was impossible for him to be affected by the bloody smell in the room.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Yu Family members were already outside of the courtyard!</p><br/><p>In the room by the side, a soft rustling sound could be heard followed by a doubtful question, \u201cWhy did sixth brother\u2019s groaning sound disappear?\u201d Then, he seemed to have been startled by the words he just said as he let out a gasp, \u201cSixth Brother!\u201d Following which, the sound of someone hastily getting off his bed could be heard.</p><br/><p>The timing was just right!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian leaped out of the window and smashed the window into pieces. Following that, he scaled the wall of the courtyard at top speed and with a flick of his wrist, two daggers shot out in the darkness. He then let out a loud roar, \u201cAssassins!\u201d before smashing another two doors. Before his voice disappeared into the darkness, Ling Tian had already landed back onto the ground and his figure disappeared into thin air.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two miserable shrieks sounded and Ling Tian\u2019s dagger had landed right in the chest of two White Jade experts of the Yu Family. The two White Jade experts who were still laying in concealment suddenly felt a sharp pain in their chest and couldn\u2019t help but let out a miserable shriek!</p><br/><p>This miserable shrieks of theirs exposed all of the other Yu Family experts and a low angry roar could be heard, \u201cAttack! Kill! Kill anyone who resists!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a few crashing sounds, the door of the room that Ling Tian was previously in was sent flying and two figures entered the room. Following that, an aggrieved and furious roar could be heard, \u201cSixth Brother!\u2026 Eighth Brother! They killed sixth brother and the rest! How vicious! They aren\u2019t even willing to let go of the injured! This daddy here will fight all of you to the death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crashing sounds could be heard from all the various rooms and seven figures appeared on the roof with their eyes burning with rage and deep hatred!</p><br/><p>The one who first let out the roar was the last one to appear. His voice was trembling as he said with grief and indignance, \u201cBig Brother, sixth brother and the rest\u2026 they\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The big brother was a lean old man in his fifties and replied nervously, \u201cNot a single one\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man who appeared the last hammered his chest as tears gushed out of his eyes and almost lost his cool from grief, \u201cTheir lives were taken with a single blade! AHHHH\u2026 Big Brother, you must take revenge for our brothers!\u201d</p><br/><p>A thick killing intent exploded forth from the big brother\u2019s figure as he roared, \u201cKill all of these b*st*rds! Take revenge for sixth brother and the rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, the experts of the Yu Family also let out a loud battle-cry and the fifty plus Yu Family experts pounced forward from the dark.</p><br/><p>Before both parties came into contact, tons of arrows and hidden weapons covered the sky and rained down on the Above Heavens experts like a thunderstorm\u2026</p><br/><p>On the roof, the eight of them let out a loud roar and no longer held anything back. With the ball full of anger that they had been holding in, they charged forward and one of them even did a somersault in midair and shot forward with a brilliant splendor of light. He had actually unleashed his \u2018man and sword as one\u2019 killing technique at the start! The raining hidden weapons were immediately reflected back by his sword light with \u2018ding ding ding\u2019 sounds.</p><br/><p>It was like heavenly lightning drawing forth earthly flames!</p><br/><p>The moment both parties came into contact with each other, they entered into a bitter battle with endless hatred in each of their hearts as their eyes turned red from killing! Eight top-notch experts of Above Heavens with three extreme experts among them were like tigers entering into a herd of sheep. The moment the battle started, the White Jade experts of the Yu Family felt that it was impossible for them to fight back and the huge gap in their strengths could be immediately seen. In just a short instant, the Yu Family experts suffered both injuries and fatalities.</p><br/><p>The Head Deacon, Yu ChaoRan, let out a battle-cry and a powerful battle prowess exploded forth from his skinny figure. The sword in his hands transformed into ten thousand rays of silver light and he actually managed to single-handedly block three Above Heavens expert. Furthermore, he remained on the offensive and actually had the upper hand.</p><br/><p>Two bright fireworks exploded in the air. It was the rescue signal of the Yu Family.</p><br/><p>After just a short while, countless black figures began swarming over from all directions.</p><br/><p>Meng JueChen raised his sword up and stabbed it into the chest of a Yu Family expert. At the same time, his left palm struck out and knocked the white-robed man to his left back. However, his right shoulder was struck because of a short moment of distraction. His figure tumbled forward slightly and he quickly brandished his sword and before the White Jade expert who ambushed him could retreat, the White Jade expert let out a miserable groan and was dismembered into two parts. A fountain of blood shot towards the air and sprayed all over Meng JueChen\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The big brother\u2019s attack was even crueler. Everytime he attacked, there would be at least a Yu Family expert being dismembered. There was not a single person capable of blocking him for even an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d A groan sounded and an Above Heavens expert was stabbed in the waist after killing one of his opponents. Turning his body around immediately, the sword which was embedded into his waist snapped into two and he reached out and strangled his enemy in the neck. Squeezing his hands tightly, his opponent\u2019s neck was actually snapped into two and a mouthful of blood sprayed out from his body at the same time!</p><br/><p>A couple of White Jade experts in the surrounding than charged forward together and the Above Heavens expert gave up on all forms of resistance. He was drowned in his opponents\u2019 swords and sabers and only had the chance to let out two groans before turning into a pile of mush by his opponents\u2019 countless weapons!</p><br/><p>\u201cNinth Brother!!!\u201d A black-robed expert let out a mournful wail and charged forward in a near-suicidal manner, ignoring the obstructing White Jade experts surrounding him. But before he could arrive, his ninth brother had already died in battle and an arrow shot towards him, accurately landing in his back. With a loud shout, he wobbly wanted to get up but was already decapitated by the surrounding swords and blades.</p><br/><p>A few swooshing sounds could then be heard and four to five figures appeared from the darkness and shot towards the six remaining Above Heavens experts. From the large winds generated from their palm strikes and the stability of their attack, it was obvious that these incoming individuals were all top-notch experts.</p><br/><p>That big brother charged forward to welcome the incoming Yu Family experts and with a flurry of kicks, punches, and stabs. He actually blocked four of the Yu Family experts and entered a bitter battle with them. Every time their weapons connected, sparks would be seen shooting out in all directions. Both parties let out a resounding battle-cry and the battlefield descended into greater chaos.</p><br/><p>In the dark, Ling Tian watched the scene in front of him with pleasure as he enjoyed this show that he had been planning for a long time already. Watching this show that played out exactly to his expectations, Ling Tian was filled with an unknown sense of achievement.</p><br/><p>The Xiao Family, Yu Family, and Above Heavens\u2026. HAHAHA\u2026 let\u2019s see what will all of your reactions be after today. If all of you can still remain composed and swallow this ball of fury, I will be truly speechless! Ling Tian giggled in his heart.</p><br/><p>Under the lead of the big brother, the six Above Heavens experts finally managed to gather back together after a series of bitter exchanges. They formed a small defensive circle as they launched crazed attacks at the Yu Family experts. By forming a small defensive circle, they wouldn\u2019t have to guard their backs but also limited their own movement space. While it wouldn\u2019t matter much in the short run, as the battle dragged on further, they would definitely suffer misfortune.</p><br/><p>As even more of the Yu Family reinforcements arrive, they had actually formed a thick wall around the small defensive circle of the Above Heavens experts. When their enemy and allies were so clearly differentiated, the six Above Heavens experts fought to the point their eyes were bloodshot from killing and did not have the intention to retreat!</p><br/><p>The horrible deaths of their brothers had stirred up their blood and they would rather fight to the death!</p><br/><p>On top of a wall far off, Yu ManLou was dressed in thin robes as he watched the miserable battle calmly with his hands behind his back as though he was watching a show. By his side, two black-robed shadows were standing silently without daring to make a single sound.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

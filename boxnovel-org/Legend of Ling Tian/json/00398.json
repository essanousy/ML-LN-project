Presently, the more chaotic the continent is, the better it would be for our Ling Family and only then will we be able to receive benefits from it. This is also something that the young noble agrees with. However, while the continent can be in chaos, war must not break out. Without young noble present, our Ling Family lacks the necessary strength and preparations. At the same time, we will not have a clear direction as well. Furthermore, if the continent were to break out into chaos, the ones who will truly benefit are those with sufficient strength and intellect. Even if we have the intellect, we lack the many years of accumulation of a true Great Family. Thus, we must definitely be extremely careful during this period of time. We must pull the various powers into this mess and have them keep each other in check while exhausting each other. But at the same time, we have to ensure that an all-out war will not happen. At the very least, we have to keep this situation up for half a year until the young noble returns. Thus, there are three tasks that we must do perfectly.\u201d</p><br/><p>A look of worry flashed past Old Madam Ling\u2019s face and she asked, \u201cWhat are the three tasks? Are they difficult?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen organized her thoughts for a short while before saying calmly, \u201cThere are definitely some difficulties involved but Chen\u2019er is confident that they can be accomplished. Chen\u2019er will just need Old Madam to keep watch on a few crucial points. The first task involves the number one financial magnate, the Xiao Family. We must definitely drag them into the chaos on the surface so that they can pressure the Yu Family. With one of them in the south and another in the north, they would definitely form a delicate balance and the empires in the central region would not dare to make a rash move. As long as an empire reveals an opening, it would definitely result in destruction by both the superpowers! With regards to the Xiao Family, I believe that there wouldn\u2019t be anyone who is more capable of analyzing them than Old Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling thought for a moment before saying, \u201cXiao FengHan and Xiao FengYang are both extremely meticulous and scheming individuals. Without sufficient assurance and rewards, the both of them would not be tempted for sure. Just this alone would be difficult to accomplish.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it was before, this would definitely be difficult to accomplish or perhaps even impossible. However, it is a different story now.\u201d Ling Chen said with confidence, \u201cWith young noble being absent, Old Madam would be the backbone of our Ling Family and definitely has the greatest authority. As long as Old Madam were to make a personal appearance and request a promise from Xiao FengHan to protect the Ling Family, he would definitely agree. With the Yu Family that they are most wary about being in the spotlight, the Xiao Family would definitely make use of this opportunity to their advantage and we will be able to stand on the fence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling\u2019s eyes lit up as she agreed, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Xiao FengHan would definitely take action with the continent in such a mess. Brilliant plan! Let me think about how I can make my request.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, Old Madam Ling suddenly let out a long sigh and said in a depressed tone, \u201cI wonder if Tian\u2019er can escape from this tribulation! If not, wouldn\u2019t this old lady\u2019s actions be giving the Xiao Family benefits for nothing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Madam\u2026 you already know?\u201d Ling Chen was dumbfounded as she raised her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a huge matter shook the whole continent, so how could it be kept from me? Beyond Heavens, Martial Order Medallion, a medallion for a life\u2026\u201d Old Madam Ling let out a bitter laugh, \u201cDo all of you think that this old lady is a fool? If not for Tian\u2019er facing such a crisis, would the Xiao Family ever agree to my request?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Madam, since young noble made such a bet and is able to send news back while taking care of the XiMen Family, he definitely has extra energy to spare and is without harm.\u201d Ling Chen said with confidence, \u201cYoung noble will definitely be alright. Rest assured Old Madam.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Madam nodded her head and continued, \u201cWhat is the second task?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe past few years, the Courtyard had secretly established supply stations all over the continent to prepare for future plans. Because the continent was peaceful in the past and to conceal their tracks, these supply stations had only purchased rations moderately. Now that things are developing into a contest of strength, it is time for us to collect rations on a wide scale. However, we will require a huge amount of money for this and our Courtyard\u2019s income is far from sufficient. So\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a problem either.\u201d Old Madam Ling nodded her head, \u201cI will mention this to Ting\u2019er later. Our Ling Family has been saving up our wealth over the past few years and it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that we are the wealthiest family in Sky Bearing. Ting\u2019er had already expanded our gold warehouse a few times and it is time to put our resources to good use. The stored gold and silver are about to turn moldy already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Ling Chen broke out into a smile, \u201cThe difficulty of the last task is the same as the second task. A large amount of money is required as well. We have to purchase a large number of weapons regardless of quality. The moment chaos breaks out, these weapons will turn into rare commodities.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can agree to that as well!\u201d Old Madam Ling agreed without hesitation, \u201cNo matter how much you need, even if you were to bankrupt the Ling Family, I will accomplish these two tasks to the best of my abilities!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Old Madam Ling\u2019s promise, Ling Chen let out a bright smile and was extremely gratified in her heart. Young noble, I have made the necessary preparations already and will make sure that everything will be accomplished in half a year. When you return, you plan can be put in motion!</p><br/><p>Will you really return half a year later?</p><br/><p>Young noble, where are you right now? Are you fine? Chen\u2019er is waiting for you\u2026</p><br/><p>I will remain alive for my most beloved\u2026</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>At this moment, both Shui QianHuan and Shui QianRou were waiting anxiously. The Northern Wei imperial family was suddenly wiped out and the Yu Family was ambushed. These two events had shocked the world and while the other parties might not know the source of the disturbance, how could they not know? It was precisely because they knew that Shui QianHuan felt a great deal of regret!</p><br/><p>Both of them recalled what Ling Chen said back then, \u201cWe have hired the \u2018First Pavilion\u2019. At that time, the First Pavilion will send out a couple of top-notch assassins to work together with you!\u201d They could not help but take in a breath of cold air! Was this the strength of the First Pavilion? What a shocking and frightening strength!</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, both the siblings could not help but let out a bitter sigh as they lamented about the opportune moment which they had missed!</p><br/><p>If the elites of their family were here at the moment and they coordinated with the Ling Family and the First Pavilion to launch an attack at the Yu Family, the Yu Family would definitely suffer greatly!</p><br/><p>However, it was a pity that they had missed this opportunity!</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a medicine for regret in this world!</p><br/><p>To think that they would miss such an opportunity! Both the siblings let out a sigh of regret as they began to resent the slow speed of their family!</p><br/><p>A gust of wind was heard, and a white-dressed teen appeared with a chilly demeanor. Facing them he said with a refined smile, \u201cHow have you been after our last meeting?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you.\u201d Shui QianHuan walked forward, \u201cFor this little brother to appear here today, I wonder if there is anything we can help you with? Please be straightforward.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who had just arrived was Ling Chi and he said with a profound smile, \u201cI am here on my big sister\u2019s orders to ask the both of you something. You should both be aware of what happened recently and I wonder if it is enough to display our sincerity and strength! However, I wonder where the Shui Family members who had pulled out of Northern Wei are at this moment? How many of them are there? How are their strengths like? Can we use them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan\u2019s face turned color as he said, \u201cHow did you know of our men who withdrew from Northern Wei?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chi smiled slightly, \u201cAs long as one has silver, all information can be bought!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the Crystal Pavilion? The Crystal Pavilion has made its appearance again?!\u201d Shui QianHuan gasped, \u201cYou guys bought the news from the Crystal Pavilion? How did you guys contact the Crystal Pavilion?\u201d Shui QianHuan\u2019s eyes narrowed at this shocking news!</p><br/><p>Just like the name suggested, the news of the whole world was transparent to the Crystal Pavilion. It was said that there wasn\u2019t anything the Crystal Pavilion didn\u2019t know and it was only a matter of the price! This phrase was widely known in the pugilistic world, but the Crystal Pavilion had disappeared in the past year. No one was able to purchase any more information from the Crystal Pavilion and the world thought that the Crystal Pavilion must have been wiped out. But when they had heard what Ling Chi said, it was as though the Crystal Pavilion was still around but just concealing themselves!</p><br/><p>Being able to transact with the Crystal Pavilion was an assurance of strength! It was as shocking as the Ling Family being able to hire the First Pavilion to attack the Yu Family!</p><br/><p>Ling Chi broke out in a bright smile and did not deny Shui QianHuan\u2019s words as he waited for a response.</p><br/><p>Silence obviously represented a tacit agreement! Shui QianHuan let out a sigh and said, \u201cThe bulk of our men have retreated from Northern Wei and are currently hidden. Without the orders of our Family Head, they will not make a rash move and we do not have the authority to command them. Furthermore, the martial arts of these individuals aren\u2019t outstanding, and they are largely politicians. They would probably be of little use.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Ling Chi laughed out loud, \u201cThe Northern Wei imperial family has already been wiped out and Northern Wei is without a head at the moment. Since young noble Shui has such an important force under your control, why don\u2019t you make use of it! Why not make use of this opportunity to let them come out of hiding and take over Northern Wei from within! Big sister said that in our alliance, our Ling Family has already displayed our sincerity but your family doesn\u2019t seem to be very sincere! Are you going to let such a good opportunity pass you by? If nothing can be determined by either of you, could it be that you are here for a vacation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan\u2019s eyes gleamed for a moment before becoming dim again, \u201cWhile your words do make sense, how would it be an easy affair with the Yu Family present in Northern Wei? If we aren\u2019t careful, all of these chess pieces which we have placed in Northern Wei would be lost! The loss would then exceed the gains!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

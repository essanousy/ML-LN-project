Will you take responsibility for me?!\u201d As she said that, she gave a lazy stretch as though she had just completed an arduous task.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian almost collapsed on the ground as he heard that. Li Xue\u2019s words were far too potent! Ling Tian never expected Li Xue to say such a thing suddenly and regardless of how thick his skin was, he was still caught off guard, \u201cNonsense! You are my sister!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was in the previous life! Let me emphasize that again!\u201d Li Xue snorted, \u201cBesides, even in our previous life, we were separated by at least five generations despite being so-called cousins. Are we going to forget about how you have just taken advantage of me? To think that you want to deny everything and leave after having your fun! Being irresponsible isn\u2019t the action of a gentleman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when am I being irresponsible? I have not even touched you at all!\u201d Ling Tian jumped up exasperatedly, \u201cYou, you you you you\u2026 unreasonable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when would a woman speak reason? You still dare to say that you didn\u2019t touch me?!\u201d Li Xue snorted, \u201cAnyway, my sixteen years of purity has been fully witnessed and touched by you. Tell me what you want to do!\u201d She then began to fold her arms and act like an unreasonable spoiled brat.</p><br/><p>This little demoness! Although he had the feeling that he would eventually fall into Li Xue\u2019s tricks, he never expected to fall like this. Thus, Ling Tian decided to employ the tactic of delaying the matter, \u201cWe shall talk about this matter again in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo be it.\u201d Li Xue said delightedly, \u201cWould I be afraid of you running away? Let me tell you, you better not try to be shameless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Who is the one being shameless here? Ling Tian let out a bitter sigh as a flash of enlightenment came to his mind, \u201cYou already intended to hang onto me without letting go? How did you suffer from those three wounds? Your martial arts should have been more than sufficient to take care of those six assassins without being injured!\u201d</p><br/><p>With her plan being seen through, Li Xue began frowning as she groaned pitifully, \u201cHow painful\u2026 my wound hurts\u2026\u201d as she moaned that, tears began to well up in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Although Ling Tian knew that she was only faking it, he still felt his heart twitching with heartache as he thought to himself, This little demoness!</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take care of you in the future! It is now time for you to take care of my wounds.\u201d Ling Tian said with a straight face.</p><br/><p>Li Xue immediately burst out into smiles as she approached Ling Tian, \u201cOkay, you can take care of me in any way you see fit in the future! Now, it is time for me to see your perfect body. Hehehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a sigh of defeat.</p><br/><p>As Li Xue meticulously tended to Ling Tian\u2019s wounds, the both of them didn\u2019t stop chatting.</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Xue, what level is your Divine Ice Formula at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe upper eighth stage and approaching the ninth stage soon. Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you cultivate so quickly? I remember that you have to absorb pure Yang energy in order to progress past the seventh stage. Since you have never left the mountains, how did you get to the eighth stage?\u201d Ling Tian asked doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fool! Does not exiting the mountain mean that I can\u2019t collect anything with Yang energy? Let me tell you, it would be possible for me to collect Yang energy items even on a snow-capped mountain!\u201d Li Xue said proudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you do it?\u201d Ling Tian was extremely concerned about this matter. Recently, he had been worried about how Ling Chen could achieve a breakthrough in her Divine Ice Formula. However, as an outer branch disciple in his previous life, he didn\u2019t have any experience for reference. Despite racking his brains for a solution, he just couldn\u2019t think of an idea. Now that he heard that Li Xue had a plan, he couldn\u2019t help but be elated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fool! I still thought that you were extremely intelligent. There is something called a convex lens.\u201d Li Xue snorted, \u201cWhile there isn\u2019t glass in this world, we can use something else to replace it such as\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian came to a realization, \u201cLike jade! Haha, I got it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour IQ is only sufficient for you to think of jade.\u201d Li Xue mocked, \u201cYou are asking me because of your little beauty right? Don\u2019t worry, I will definitely help you arrange it properly when the time comes, lest you end up scarring your little beauty because of your ignorance and it would become my fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian broke out into a cold sweat!</p><br/><p>\u201cOne two three\u2026\u201d Li Xue counted carefully, \u201cFifteen wounds! Why so many? It shouldn\u2019t be possible for those few fellows to injure you so badly!\u201d As she said that, tears almost rolled down her eyes from heartache.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a bitter laugh, \u201cI have been tidying up my meridians according to your proper cultivation formula and have only reached the sixth stage currently. I will need another day at least to reach the ninth stage. Thus, my man and sword as one was unleashed with the sixth stage and is lacking as compared to my peak form. However, they are only superficial wounds and will heal up quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue replied with an \u2018oh\u2019 before grumbling, \u201cWith your movement techniques, it should have been an easy matter for you to stall for time until I finished off those six fellows. You only know how to act strong! I know, it is probably your male chauvinist pride acting up right? Hmph, only heroes are allowed to save beauties but you heroes will have your pride wounded when being saved by a beauty. Thus, you risked being injured in order to finish off those assassins before my arrival! Afraid that you will owe me a favor?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out an embarrassed smile as Li Xue\u2019s words were spot on. Seeing Li Xue wanting to continue, Ling Tian quickly changed the topic, \u201cTalking about that, despite it being slightly more than a day only, I could feel that my meridians are far more tough and flexible than before. If this situation can persist, breaking through to the tenth stage shouldn\u2019t be too far away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still think that it is extremely simple?\u201d Li Xue\u2019s attention was indeed directed away, \u201cWhen you cultivate up to the twelfth stage, you will know what is considered difficult! The unbreakable thirteenth stage will probably drive you insane.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThirteenth stage of the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula?\u201d Ling Tian suddenly stood up, \u201cWeren\u2019t there only twelve stages in the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula? Where did this thirteenth stage come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue let out a mysterious smile, \u201cActually, the so-called thirteenth stage is as good as non-existent, so we are used to saying that there are only twelve stages. While the thirteenth stage does exist, not a single person has managed to cultivate it for the past thousand years. It\u2019s best you give up on it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe thirteenth stage of the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula is an extremely mystical one! There aren\u2019t any mnemonic chants, meridian pathways or any cultivation experience. How can one cultivate it? Back then, our Ling Family\u2019s ancestor only managed to create the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula by combining various cultivation formulas from the Shaolin monastery, Wudang Mountain, and other famous heritages. Ever since our ancestor passed on, not to mention the thirteenth stage, there weren\u2019t many who were even able to cultivate up to the tenth stage! An outer branch disciple like you breaking into the tenth stage is already extremely rare and its best that you don\u2019t think about anything more.\u201d Li Xue chuckled and said in an indifferent manner, \u201cIn any case, you would already be the number one expert of the world if you can achieve the twelfth stage and you would definitely be able to win against that Justice. Why do you have to pursue that non-existent thirteenth stage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shook his head in disagreement, \u201cHow can that be the same? Since I know that there is a thirteenth stage, how can I not cultivate it?\u201d</p><br/><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Xue said, \u201cLet me tell it to you then. There is only a single word in the thirteenth stage: Emptiness! Let me ask you, how do you cultivate it? The manual doesn\u2019t even say what can be considered successfully cultivating it. If you were to enter into cultivation deviation, who in the world would be able to save you with your inner qi of the twelfth stage? Furthermore, it is still far too early to talk about that. After all, there probably isn\u2019t much hope for you to get to the twelfth stage in this life of yours. Hehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian muttered to himself as he lowered his head, \u201cThirteenth stage!\u201d A resolute gaze suddenly shone out from his eyes and the corners of his lips curled up slightly. However, Li Xue didn\u2019t see it because his head was lowered.</p><br/><p>After a short while, Ling Tian raised his head up and said, \u201cDo you still remember the fact that the family sent me to the Shaolin monastery?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue immediately knew what Ling Tian was referring to and exclaimed, \u201cYou have the recipe for the Great Cyclic Pellet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a delighted smirk, \u201cNot just the recipe! I have successfully concocted a cauldron of it. Each pellet would raise one\u2019s cultivation by twenty years! When your injuries are better, I will protect you and you can consume a pellet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue let out a depressed sigh and shook her head, \u201cWhat a pity. No wonder your cultivation rose so quickly! However, I already can\u2019t consume that item.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was startled, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you puzzled about the progress of my Divine Ice Formula?\u201d Li Xue forced a smile, \u201cWhen I was eight, I coincidentally found a Purple Ginseng Fruit. Haiz\u2026 I have already consumed something similar, and with the origin of the herb being similar to the Great Cyclic Pellet, my body wouldn\u2019t be able to endure the consumption of the pellet.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian remained silent, he secretly sighed in his heart. While the Purple Ginseng Fruit had a miraculous effect, its effect definitely couldn\u2019t be compared to the Great Cyclic Pellet. Thus, Li Xue had missed out on a great opportunity to raise her cultivation.</p><br/><p>However, if he were to place himself in her shoes, he would have definitely consumed the ginseng fruit if he were to find it when he was eight! It can only be said that they each had their own fortune! Furthermore, Li Xue\u2019s present cultivation was definitely a result of consuming the ginseng. In any case, the Purple Ginseng Fruit was still an extremely rare herb and only a tad bit worse than the Great Cyclic Pellet!</p><br/><p>Li Xue then broke out into a smile and said, \u201cHowever, if there is that legendary item\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

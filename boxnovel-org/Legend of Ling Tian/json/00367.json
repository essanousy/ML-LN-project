After the accommodations of the Yu Family troops had been arranged, both the Yu Family elders were seated in the hall with the members of the Ling Family. After the maids served tea, every single person in the hall was obviously filled with their own worries and the whole hall was filled with an awkward silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe Family Head Ling is probably wondering why our Ling Family is so anxious about Miss BingYan\u2019s marriage.\u201d Yu ZhanShui said with a chuckle and broke the icy atmosphere, \u201cSince we are already in-laws, there is no need for me to hide anything. Our Yu Family will be having a life and death battle with our arch nemesis, Water of Heavenly Wind. However, victory is still up in the air, and things are not looking too optimistic at this moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ZhanFeng let out a long sigh before saying solemnly, \u201cThus, my family head wants to arrange the marriages of the younger generation before the battle. Ah ah, as for the dowry, it is just a matter of time and so we decided to send it over earlier. It is just some material possessions and isn\u2019t much to the Ling Family. It is just a small token of the sincerity of our family head.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were what the elders had come up with after some discussion to dispel the wariness of the Ling Family. Truth in the lies and lies in the truth. The true art of lying is to have 90% truth and 10% lies. While these words spoken by the Yu Family weren\u2019t 90% true, it was a good 50% true at the very least. Even if the Ling Family didn\u2019t believe them completely, at least some of their doubts would be dispelled.</p><br/><p>However, both Old Madam Ling and Chu Ting\u2019er were frowning in thought and both Ling Zhan and Ling Xiao were already laughing heartily and warmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder where our Third Master and little princess are staying at now? This old man has to visit him to hand him something. The one in charge of the engagement would still be Third Master Yu.\u201d Yu ZhanShui said in a dignified manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Third Master and little princess are staying at the back courtyard. Men, bring the two elders to Third Master Yu.\u201d Old Madam Ling commanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you, Madam!\u201d Both the Yu Elders said with their fists cupped and left.</p><br/><p>In the hall, Old Madam Ling let out a long sigh and looked out with worry, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen Tian\u2019er for two days already, where exactly is he? How can he be missing at such a time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er replied, \u201cChen\u2019er said that he went out for a vacation with the two seniors from Beyond Heavens. With two peerless experts by his side and Tian\u2019er\u2019s own martial arts, he would definitely be safe and back in a few days. While Tian\u2019er is extremely mature, he is still a 15 to 16-year-old teen. Now that the matters back home are finally settled, it is normal for him to go out for a breather. Tian\u2019er has been carrying far too many worries these few years and it isn\u2019t a bad thing for him to be a little playful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling shook her head and said with a low voice, \u201cNot necessarily! Not necessarily!\u201d However, who knows whether she was referring to Ling Tian not necessarily being out for vacation or him not necessarily being playful.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Chu Ting\u2019er suddenly felt her heart throbbing as Ling Chen\u2019s red and swollen eyes appeared in her mind. All of a sudden, she was filled with frustration and anxiety.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder, Third Elder, the both of you are here.\u201d Yu BingYan said with a calm tone without a trace of joy.</p><br/><p>No matter what, these two elders were here to send her dowry and Yu BingYan should be filled with excitement and shyness. Even if she wasn\u2019t excited or shy, she should be polite at the very least. But the moment Yu BingYan thought about how Ling Tian\u2019s life and death was still unknown, she just could not bring herself to be excited or shy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the little princess accustomed to staying here? Where is Third Master Yu?\u201d After sending away the maids and ensuring that there wasn\u2019t anyone in the surroundings, he asked with a mellow tone. However, not a single trace of concern could be felt in his words, and they were instead slightly chilly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Uncle was injured from sparring with someone and is resting in his room.\u201d Yu BingYan sat down on a chair and actually didn\u2019t bother ordering the maids to prepare tea. Both the First and Third Elder were from the ambitious faction of their Yu Family and had unscrupulous means. In the family, they didn\u2019t place anyone in their sights apart from the family head, Yu ManLou. Even in the face of her father, Yu ManTang, the both of them were not the slightest bit respectful. Thus, Yu BingYan never had any goodwill towards either of them and even slightly detested them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Master is injured?\u201d the Third Elder, Yu ZhanKong, said with a trace of obvious mockery, \u201cWas he injured in the hands of Beyond Heavens\u2019 Justice? He really overestimates his own capabilities and doesn\u2019t know how to think before acting! It\u2019s about time for him to be taught a lesson!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing these words of mockery, Yu BingYan couldn\u2019t help but be incensed. \u201cThat\u2019s right, Third Uncle lost because he was inferior. I believe that when Third Elder faces Justice, the outcome will definitely be completely different. However, Third Elder\u2019s ability to predict what has happened is amazing indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she suddenly realized that Yu ManTian was injured by Justice a mere two days ago. However, both the elders should be on their way to the Ling Residence at that time. So how did they find out about that? Unless they had already\u2026 Yu BingYan\u2019s face turned chilly as her heart sank.</p><br/><p>Yu ZhanKong snorted and his face turned ashen. While he was conceited, he wasn\u2019t blindly arrogant and was aware of his own capabilities. In the world today, there probably wasn\u2019t a single individual who dared to say that they could win against Justice. In fact, not to mention facing Justice, he wasn\u2019t even confident of winning against Yu ManTian.</p><br/><p>Yu ZhanShui said with displeasure, \u201cWhy is there a need to concerned about such small affairs? As a member of the Yu Family, the family has an important mission for you and you have to put your heart into the matter.\u201d With a single phrase, he changed the topic and ignored Yu BingYan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan felt her heart shake as she asked, \u201cWhat important mission?\u201d At the same time, she knew that this was probably the true reason for her family sending the dowry and could not help but be anxious.</p><br/><p>Yu ZhanShui let out a chuckle and said coldly, \u201cLing Tian is being chased by Justice from Beyond Heavens and his death is certain. At the earliest, news of his death will be passed on in a day. At the very latest, news of his death should be made known by two months. Presently, you are the only lady who Ling Tian has given a proper status and so you will be the only person left in the Ling Family when Ling Tian dies! You must definitely make use of your status to grasp the strength of the Ling Family and submit to our Yu Family. If this matter is accomplished, you will have the greatest merit!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe greatest merit?\u201d Yu BingYan let out a dismal smile as her hands were clenched tightly into a fist and her face turned red.</p><br/><p>The words spoken by Yu ZhanShui thundered in her ears and Yu BingYan felt like her world was crumbling and her eyes blacking out. The humiliation she felt made her feel like pulling out her sword to commit suicide!</p><br/><p>Beyond Heavens and Martial Order Medallion had always been the biggest taboo of the Yu Family. These two phrases were something that even the thousand-year-old family, Jade of Heavenly Star, didn\u2019t dare to provoke! If anyone from the Yu Family were to provoke them, the Yu Family wouldn\u2019t stand up for them but would immediately distance themselves. In fact, the Yu Family might even take the initiative to exterminate them in exchange for their peace and security. The only reason why the Yu Family had not replaced Northern Wei for the past hundreds of years was because of the existence of the Martial Order Medallion! Thus, Yu BingYan knew that despite being the number-one family in Heavenly Star, their Yu Family was still fearful of Beyond Heavens!</p><br/><p>There was only a single outcome in provoking Beyond Heavens: Death!</p><br/><p>Now that Ling Tian had met with such a hopeless situation, she would still be able to understand if her family wouldn\u2019t lend a helping hand. However, she never imagined that her family would make use of this chance to usurp power from the Ling Family! This was no different from taking advantage of the Ling Family\u2019s demise and hitting them when they are down! Such actions were just despicable to the extreme!</p><br/><p>The most infuriating thing was the fact that they were making use of the only girl in her generation to be a sacrificial pawn in this plan! Her lifetime of happiness, chastity, reputation\u2026 were all made use of by her family!</p><br/><p>All these for the greatest merit?</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder, BingYan has a question and I wonder if I should ask it?\u201d Yu BingYan tried her best to suppress her fuming anger but her voice started to tremble and her whole face turned ashen!</p><br/><p>\u201cShoot away.\u201d Yu ZhanShui sat down on a chair indifferently with a calm expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since I was young, BingYan has been taught that a lady should submit to three people. Submit to my father when I am at home, submit to my husband when I am married and submit to my son if my husband is dead.\u201d Yu BingYan took in a breath of cold air, \u201cNow that the engagement is confirmed, BingYan can be considered a member of the Ling Family. For the family to make such a decision, are they considering the fact that I would be placed in a spot? Doess father have anything to say about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Master naturally agrees to this.\u201d Yu ZhanKong snickered, \u201cThis is a matter which concerns the ambitions of our Yu Family, so why would Second Master disagree? As for the engagement with the Ling Family, it is no more than a scheme; how can it be treated seriously? Even if you have to sacrifice a little for the family, so what about that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo more than a scheme? Cannot be treated seriously?\u201d Yu BingYan\u2019s lips began to tremble, \u201cThe whole world knows that I am going to be married to Ling Tian and with the influence of both our families, the whole continent would probably be informed of this matter! It actually cannot be treated seriously??? Do you guys have any face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPreposterous!\u201d Yu ZhanShui shouted as he said with an icy expression, \u201cLittle princess, as long as you are the little princess for our Yu Family for a day, you will always be the little princess of our Yu Family! No matter what, the little princess of our Yu Family belongs to the Yu Family! It is your honor to make sacrifices for the family! How can you be so preposterous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am no longer the little princess of the Yu Family!\u201d Yu BingYan raised her head up proudly, \u201cI only have a single status now: the daughter-in-law of the Ling Family! Ling Tian is the man I love and nothing can change that!\u201d As she said those words, a look of happiness and satisfaction filled her face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

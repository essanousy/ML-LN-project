Senior Justice also gave me another cultivation sutra named \u2018Mysterious Yin Essence Heart Sutra\u2019. With the training of the Mysterious Yin Essence Heart Sutra, it is useful for suppressing the Divine Black Negative Meridians. As long as I do not purposely agitate them, the Divine Black Negative Meridians will lay dormant for a relatively long period of time. As long as I properly cultivate the Mysterious Yin Essence Heart Sutra, there is a chance for me to even purge the frost toxins in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. This is truly the fortune of my Yu Family!\u201d Yu ManLou laughed heartily. The three brothers only had a single daughter or niece and Yu ManLou also greatly doted on Yu BingYan. The moment Yu ManLou saw Yu BingYan and thought about how she was extremely obedient since she was young, Yu ManLou was immediately filled with love and tenderness. Everything was fine as long as the one who cured Yu BingYan wasn\u2019t Ling Tian. If Ling Tian could even cure the Divine Black Negative Meridians, Yu ManLou would have to reconsider his evaluation of Ling Tian. As for Justice curing the Divine Black Negative Meridians, Yu ManLou wasn\u2019t too surprised by this. After all, it was only natural for the number one expert in the world to have such abilities!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang still couldn\u2019t be at ease and grabbed Yu BingYan\u2019s wrist and sent his inner qi into her body to investigate her condition.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, no!\u201d Being caught off guard, Yu BingYan was immediately anxious. The icy inner qi within her body wasn\u2019t to be underestimated and she was afraid that her father would be harmed by it.</p><br/><p>Before she could finish her sentence, Yu ManTang trembled and he unsteadily took two steps back with a pale countenance. He never expected that his warm inner qi would suddenly meet two waves of extremely icy inner qi and half his body was almost frozen. Only after he let go of Yu BingYan\u2019s wrist and circulated his inner qi for a few cycles was the chilly condition dispelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a powerful frost toxin!\u201d Yu ManTang said with lingering fear and worry, \u201cYan\u2019er, with such a powerful frost toxin in your body, how will you be able to endure it?\u201d Through his probing, Yu ManTang could feel that the Divine Black Negative Meridians in Yu BingYan\u2019s body didn\u2019t weaken in the slightest but seemed to have flared up instead. He couldn\u2019t help but be filled with worry for his daughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am fine, father!\u201d Yu BingYan smiled, \u201cAlthough the frost toxins in my body seem to be more severe, it is only because Senior Justice used his inner qi to suppress the Divine Black Negative Meridians. The frost toxins are no longer a huge burden to my body and with the aid of the Mysterious Yin Essence Heart Sutra, your daughter will be able to deal with it.\u201d After the excitement in her heart from returning home died down, Yu BingYan could not help but recall the days she had in the Ling Family Courtyard and Ling Tian\u2019s warm embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great! That\u2019s great! For you to receive the aid of a peerless expert from Beyond Heavens, it shows that my daughter is a fortunate individual. It seems like Ling Tian truly put in a great deal of effort as well!\u201d Yu ManTang nodded his head with gratification. Looking at his daughter, a merciful and doting look could be seen on his face. As the Second Master of the Yu Family, he naturally understood how difficult it was to invite Justice to take action. He was sure that Ling Tian would have definitely needed to pay a huge price to invite Justice.</p><br/><p>Seeing the strands of white hair on her father\u2019s head, Yu BingYan felt a stabbing pain in her heart. When she left home, her father\u2019s head was still a silky black color but after a short half a year, his hair had actually whitened greatly. It was obviously because of him worrying constantly about her all the time and it was all thanks to her being unfilial!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou coughed twice, took a few steps forward, and stroked Yu BingYan\u2019s silky hair. At the same time, his gaze was filled with a myriad of emotions including pity, guilt, shame, resolution, and even killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan\u2019er, Uncle is also glad to see you return safely. You are back to participate in the generational battle between the Shui and our Yu Family. As a member of our Yu Family, there are some responsibilities that you cannot push away. You have to prepare yourself mentally for that. Since you had the fortune to receive a mysterious skill from Justice, you may be able to turn things around.\u201d Yu ManLou hesitated for a moment before finally talking slowly. At the start, he spoke slowly as though he was hesitating about something but he gradually spoke faster and faster as though he made a decision.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan felt a tinge of coldness in her heart as she said gently, \u201cI wonder what kind of responsibility Uncle is talking about? What does Uncle mean by turning things around?\u201d</p><br/><p>A glare shone in Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes and he said slowly, \u201cFor a family to survive for a thousand years without falling, countless sacrifices and hardships must be endured along the way. How can a person who does not belong in an aristocratic family understand the bitterness and sourness of the rise and fall in a family? Currently, the family has already reached its peak and the Yu Family has never reached such heights before in history. However, a huge enemy also lies before us at this moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes were vacant as he sighed, \u201cThe enemy that our family is currently facing is also an enemy that our family has never faced before in a thousand years of development. Thus, in order to defeat the enemy and ensure the prosperity of our family, we need to pay a certain price! Regardless of whether or not we are willing to pay this price, this price is a necessary one. As a member of the Yu Family, no one shall be allowed to avoid the matter. Even if it is me, your father or your third uncle. As long as the family needs us to sacrifice ourselves, we wouldn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest! BingYang, as the only daughter from the direct descent of the family, even if you were lucky to receive the teachings of the number one hidden sect, as a member of the Yu Family, you have no choice!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan lowered her head, afraid that Yu ManLou would see the proud look on her face. That\u2019s right, she had a look of pride! The powerful enemy who their Yu Family had never faced before in the past thousand years was without a doubt her Tian\u2019ge!</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan said in a soft tone, \u201cFirst Uncle is trying to say that BingYan will have to pay a price in the upcoming generational battle? I wonder what kind of a price BingYan will have to pay? I hope that First Uncle will enlighten me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou turned around and did not wish to continue looking at Yu BingYan as he said with a heavy tone, \u201cThe battle between the families will be a battle of life and death! The date of the battle has already been set and it cannot be changed! Since you have spoken out openly, I shall not hide anything from you either. While the Divine Black Negative Meridians in your body have been suppressed by Justice\u2019s mystical might and you even received a legendary secret manual, you have not come into contact with martial arts for the past decade and you are like a blank sheet of paper. You don\u2019t have to worry about victory or defeat when facing the little princess of the Shui Family but the price that you will have to pay will probably be the price of your life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou suddenly turned around with a burning gaze, \u201cThis is the arrangement of destiny! I know that you are unsatisfied and unresigned but I do not wish to lie to you at this very moment. I only hope that you will prepare yourself for it. Regardless of the reason, you are still my niece and even if I have to send you to your death, I want to give you an explanation first!\u201d</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the hall immediately became chilly.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang turned around with a desolate expression and his eyes shut. The joy from his daughter\u2019s illness being cured could no longer be seen. He originally wanted to risk the fury of his big brother and sneak BingYan out of the Yu Family but he never imagined that Yu ManLou would see through his plans and openly say his piece at this moment!</p><br/><p>The moment Yu ManLou said his piece, it would be the decision of the family and the decision could no longer be changed! Even if Yu ManTang didn\u2019t want to face the decision, he had no choice but to accept it. If Yu ManTang still thought of sending his daughter away at this moment, it would be akin to betraying his family and this was something that Yu ManTang would never be able to accept!</p><br/><p>A bitter smile could be seen on Yu BingYan\u2019s face. She knew that her first uncle would definitely show his cards during this trip of hers but she never expected him to show his cards this quickly! It seemed like her first uncle could not wait to send her to her death just so he could give Ling Tian a blow!</p><br/><p>Half a year ago, her first uncle sold her out for the ambition of swallowing the Ling Family. Today, he wanted to make use of her to strike a blow at the Ling Family and her husband! So what if she was Yu ManLou\u2019s flesh and blood?!</p><br/><p>I won\u2019t let things go your way!</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since I was young, BingYan understood my destiny and knew that I was the main character of the generational battle. BingYan already understood that I had to sacrifice for the family\u2026\u201d Yu BingYan said in a righteous manner.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s face turned dull as he heard that but he was elated in his heart. \u201cYan\u2019er is truly understanding\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he never expected Yu BingYan to interrupt him with a sneer, \u201cHowever, First Uncle seems to have forgotten something important. Things are no longer like before. When First Uncle talked about the Yu Family disciples, it includes everyone within these premises except for me.\u201d While she had already made relevant arrangements to deal with Yu ManLou\u2019s demands, Yu BingYan could not help but speak out the words of her heart. Ever since she was young, she had always been filled with fear and reverence for her first uncle. But at this moment, Yu BingYan no longer had a single trace of fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s expression changed and his cold gaze shot over, lowering the temperature in the room, \u201cNiece BingYan is trying to say that you do not acknowledge that you are a Yu Family disciple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan lifted her head up proudly, \u201cThis niece is already Mrs. Ling!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPreposterous!\u201d Yu ManLou flew into a rage and slapped a chair beside him. With a loud \u2018pa\u2019 sound, the sandalwood chair was reduced to dust, \u201cEven if you are married to Ling Tian, you are still Yu BingYan! The first word of your name is still \u2018Yu\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, if this was half a year ago, that would be the case indeed.\u201d A mocking smile could be seen on Yu BingYan\u2019s face, \u201cAt that time, if BingYan died, I would have to be buried in the tomb of the Yu Family. But now, even if BingYan dies, I can only be buried in the Ling Family\u2019s tomb!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan took two steps back and glared at Yu ManLou without backing down, \u201cAs the Family Head of the Yu Family, First Uncle can naturally give an order to the daughter of the Yu Family! If BingYan does not remember wrongly, First Uncle instructed Third Uncle to propose a marriage to the Ling Family and form goodwill between the families even if BingYan was a concubine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s face flushed with awkwardness and despite what Yu BingYan said being the truth, Yu ManLou refused to admit it and roared instead, \u201cThat was just a stop-gap measure, how can it still count right now?! The matters of today cannot be compared to the matters of yesterday!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs the daughter of the family, BingYan can naturally sacrifice anything. It was the same back then even if I had to become someone else\u2019s concubine. However, the BingYan today isn\u2019t the BingYan from yesterday and I am already the daughter-in-law of the Ling Family. If the Ling Family wants me to sacrifice myself, I can only sacrifice myself for the Ling Family! I hope that First Uncle will remember this. A woman who marries out is like a tub of water being spilled out. I, BingYan, am already a member of the Ling Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>PA!! Yu ManLou had no retort to Yu BingYan\u2019s words and swung his arm out to give her a tight slap.</p></div>\n</div>"}

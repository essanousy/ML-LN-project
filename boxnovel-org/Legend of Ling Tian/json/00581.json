Young Noble Ling Tian is here to reinforce us!\u201d A loud roar sounded and it spread throughout the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian! These two words seemed to carry with them a mystical power. All of a sudden, the warriors of the Ling Family seemed to have eaten an aphrodisiac and became extremely lively. As for the Xiao Family soldiers, they seemed to have curled up in fear as their eyes darted around the battlefield. With the Xiao Family\u2019s morale dropping to rock bottom and the Ling Family\u2019s morale being boosted, the Ling Family army that was originally in danger of defeat had actually defended against the Xiao Family\u2019s attacks.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was currently the idol of all the armies and soldiers in the continent. With a mere five men, he charged into a 400,000 man army to save his father and had actually retreated safely. He was even able to create mountains of corpses within the enemy\u2019s army and had made use of the battle to wipe out the elites of the Northern Wei army!</p><br/><p>His battle record had spread throughout the whole continent and his existence was like that of a battle deity. Hearing that Ling Tian was here, the Ling Family soldiers were immediately at ease. They even felt that Xiao FengYang\u2019s 150,000 men army weren\u2019t enough for them to kill\u2026</p><br/><p>This was Meng LiGe\u2019s plan of raising his troops\u2019 morale while crushing his enemies\u2019 morale! How would the meticulous Meng LiGe let go of such a good opportunity to raise his soldiers\u2019 morale? Without a second thought, he carried out such a plan\u2026</p><br/><p>Before the shock of \u2018Ling Tian\u2019s\u2019 arrival had faded, Meng LiGe\u2019s elite reinforcements were already at the front of the formation. A series of sharp shrills could be heard filling the sky and the soldiers of the Ling Family split into two. Following that, arrows covered the sky like dark clouds and turned the whole sky dark before those thousands of arrows landed in the Xiao Family\u2019s camp!</p><br/><p>Countless miserable shrieks could be heard and three thousand Ling Family cavalry charged into the battlefield and the enemy\u2019s formations!</p><br/><p>It was like a bunch of adult elephants charging into a herd of sheep!</p><br/><p>The 3000 cavalry waved their blades at the same time!</p><br/><p>The neat row of blade lights broke through the clouds and formed a white bolt of lightning. As they waved their blades down, a fountain of blood sprayed out from the Xiao army\u2019s formation. The faces of the 3000 soldiers remained cold and they continued breaking through the enemy\u2019s formation. Leaving behind a path of blood, they arrived at the back of the Xiao Family formation!</p><br/><p>Just when everyone thought that this cavalry would turn around and launch a second round of massacre in the formation, the cavalry had sped up and dashed towards the middle army where Xiao FengYang was located!</p><br/><p>The middle army where Xiao FengYang was located was undeniably the core of the Xiao Family army but also where the defense was the tightest. Attacking the middle army with three thousand cavalry was akin to seeking death!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, they were indeed seeking their deaths! However, they had to die a meaningful death!</p><br/><p>The speed of the war horses was increased to the maximum and the horses were already panting heavily with white smoke coming out of their nostrils and mouth. This was a sign of immense exhaustion and all of the energy was converted into the fastest possible speed! The 3000 cavalry of the Ling Family raised up their blood-stained blades and charged towards Xiao FengYang with a boundless killing intent!</p><br/><p>Death warriors!</p><br/><p>These cavalry who were seeking death were the elite death warriors of the Ling Family! With certain death in their hearts, they created an opening in Xiao FengYang\u2019s army! The used their deaths in exchange for the largest benefits!</p><br/><p>On the other side, eight flags were raised in the Ling Family army and another cavalry charged out of the Ling Family army. It was another 3000 men! Following behind the blood path which their comrades carved out, they sprinted forward in an almost fanatical manner!</p><br/><p>Another path was created!</p><br/><p>Following that\u2026 Another path\u2026</p><br/><p>A total of eight paths were created and the 24,000 cavalry soldiers of the Ling Family charged out in a crazed fashion! They ignored the malevolent-looking Xiao Family soldiers as though they didn\u2019t exist and sacrificed their lives to kill a blood path! After the cavalry, the densely packed infantry charged forward like a raging tsunami!</p><br/><p>A full 24,000 elite cavalry and 85,000 infantry! These one hundred thousand soldiers were already the largest military might that Meng LiGe could take out right now. However, he invested them all into this single battle! He sent them all into battle the moment they reached the battlefield without a single shred of hesitation!</p><br/><p>He did not leave any reserves behind and did not have any considerations!</p><br/><p>Everything would be decided with a single battle!</p><br/><p>In the Ling Family camp, only ten thousand Violent Wind Gang members were left to guard the camp! Even if they had some battle prowess, they were not a proper army after all and could not participate in this battle directly! The two gang leaders of the Violent Wind Gang, Ling Three, and Li Lin gripped their blades with their muscles all tensed up and battle intent soaring. They hated the fact that they could not dive into the intense battle to do battle as well! However, under Meng LiGe\u2019s strict orders, they did not dare to make a rash move and could only clench their fists in frustration!</p><br/><p>This was also an extremely crazy plan!</p><br/><p>Ending the battle with the fastest possible speed with the price of a large number of casualties before returning to Sky Bearing immediately! This was Meng LiGe\u2019s plan for the battle. Even if Sky Bearing had a robust strength, it was difficult for them to support three different battles at the same time. The three different battles had already exhausted the bulk of Sky Bearing\u2019s army and Sky Bearing was currently like a naked virgin without a single shred of defense! Currently, the Ling Family did not have the time to waste with the Xiao Family. Even if the Xiao Family did not have the ability to drag out the battle with the Ling Family, their Ling Family didn\u2019t have that ability either. They had to wipe out the Xiao Family in a single blow! They had to end the battle swiftly before the Yu Family had a chance to react to their battle!</p><br/><p>If their battle with the Xiao Family dragged on, Yu ManLou would make use of the opportunity to send out his forces and attack the Ling Family from all directions. At that time, the Ling Family would face the risk of being split up into pieces! Even if Ling Tian and Yu ManLou had a five-year agreement between them, none of them including Ling Tian, Ling Chen, or Li Xue felt that Yu ManLou would let go of such a good opportunity in order to maintain his gentlemanly poise.</p><br/><p>That was something that was impossible.</p><br/><p>Thus, Meng LiGe adopted such a battle strategy despite the large number of casualties!</p><br/><p>In order to quickly gain victory over desperate soldiers, they could only pay a huge price!</p><br/><p>Apart from this, there wasn\u2019t another way!</p><br/><p>As long as there was another way, the military strategist Meng LiGe would not have made such a risky decision. However, he had no choice but to make such a huge sacrifice in order to wipe out the threat in the east!</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang\u2019s eyes narrowed!</p><br/><p><em>\u2018They have arrived!\u2019 </em>He never imagined that the Ling Family would move so quickly. It was as if the Ling Family had already made all of their preparations before this!</p><br/><p><em>\u2018Could it be that the flood was a doing of the Ling Family? However, just how did they accomplish such a feat? Knock down the mountain? How could that be possible? Was this something that a human could accomplish? If a human was capable of such a feat, their Xiao Family wouldn\u2019t have led such a carefree life for five hundred years!\u2019</em></p><br/><p>With things developing to such a point, Xiao FengYang did not have the time to consider if the Ling Family was prepared before this. He also did not have the time to wonder if the reversal of the Blue Jade River was a scheme of the Ling Family. It was already meaningless to think about these at this point. Xiao FengYang only knew that this could be the final battle of his life!</p><br/><p>If the first wave of the Ling Family cavalry really breaks through the defense line of the middle army, Xiao FengYang\u2019s army would fall into chaos immediately! Although he knew that his defeat was near, Xiao FengYang would never allow such a humiliation to happen!</p><br/><p>He would rather die in a bitter battle!</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang\u2019s eyes burned with craziness as he waved his command flag down resolutely!</p><br/><p>The sky was immediately covered by a dark wave of arrows! Arrows shot out from the Xiao Family camp continuously and plenty of the Ling Family cavalry fell off their horses. However, they were charging too quickly and the fastest cavalry troops were already out of the arrows\u2019 range. In a couple of breaths time, they were only an arrow\u2019s distance away from the Xiao Family camp!</p><br/><p>At such a distance, unless the Xiao Family gets into a brawl with the Ling army, it was impossible to harm them!</p><br/><p>The horns sounded and the remaining hundred thousand Xiao Family soldiers let out a battle cry. With a heaven shaking roar, half of their soldiers charged forward to receive the Ling Family\u2019s cavalry!</p><br/><p>As the ground trembled, the cavalry of both parties grew nearer and nearer to each other. They could clearly see the faces of each other and could even clearly see the bloodshot eyes of the other party!</p><br/><p>The Xiao Family archers only had the chance to let out two waves of arrows before the cavalry of both armies met in an earth-shattering battle! After everyone was blinded by the flashing reflections of the blade, the sounds of bestial cries could be heard in both armies and blood shot to the skies!</p><br/><p>A loud roar sounded!</p><br/><p>At the rear of the Xiao Family, a squad of cavalry soldiers charged down from a small hill and penetrated into the back of the Xiao Family army!</p><br/><p>A loud roar sounded, \u201cLing Tian is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice sounded like thunder!</p><br/><p>The person in the lead was clad in black with a golden crown. His face was like a refined piece of jade and had an extraordinary appearance.</p><br/><p>He was Young Noble Ling, the number one death god of the continent!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was in the middle, Feng Mo on his left and Ling Seventeen on his right. There were another 1500 burly men behind them charging down like tigers. Anyone who blocked them would be dragged into a storm of blood and a wave of miserable shrieks sounded. Countless broken limbs flew out in every direction and blood spewed out like water sprinklers watering a garden!</p><br/><p>A blade in Ling Tian\u2019s hands shot out like a shooting star towards the Marshal\u2019s flag of the Xiao Family army. Even after slicing the flagpole into two, the force of the blade was not completely exhausted and it continued to weave through the Xiao army, slicing three burly men into six halves!</p><br/><p>The Xiao camp had fallen into complete chaos after Ling Tian\u2019s appearance!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s sudden appearance was like a huge stimulus to the already intense battle and the miserable battle exploded further! At the same time, the Xiao Family\u2019s final bit of morale was also wiped out!</p><br/><p>Among the Ling Family cavalry, a skinny officer jumped off his horse and his figure weaved through the enemy\u2019s forces like a demon. With a flash of sword light, more than a dozen Xiao Family soldiers miserably collapsed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Before the others could come close, this skinny figure spun around and seven to eight small black goose egg sized balls shot towards the surrounding. After spinning around again, another ten or more goose egg sized balls flew out and a large portion of these black balls shot towards the archers!</p><br/><p><em>Hong hong hong\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Without a single sign, a series of explosions sounded. Wherever the balls exploded, a small clearing would be made and decapitated heads would fly. These decapitated heads would then be sent flying by another series of explosions like they were wingless birds.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! Thunderbeads?!\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s body trembled, \u201cEven that lass is here?\u201d</p><br/><p>That skinny figure then shot to the sky with a crisp roar and levitated in mid-air. At the same time, that figure spun around and countless black balls were sent flying in all directions. Following that, a series of shrieks sounded throughout the Xiao army and limbs were sent flying in all directions!</p><br/><p>Lean phoenix eyes with a dense killing intent! She was Miss Li Xue who was carrying her secret weapon!</p><br/><p>From her attacks alone, almost a thousand were injured and killed!</p><br/><p>The more important thing was that this special weapon had destroyed the spirit of the Xiao Family!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still decided to make this thing? Who asked you to use such an item?\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s angry roar sounded from afar as though he was extremely dissatisfied. However, his next sentence revealed his intentions. \u201cUsing it in such a manner is far too big of a waste! Don\u2019t throw it all away! Leave some for me to play with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue snorted with anger, \u201cNo more, there isn\u2019t a single one left. It is best for you to continue being a Confucian scholar! Pretentious fellow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s sword swept out and he jumped off his horse. A few Xiao soldiers were sent flying and Ling Tian sped to Li Xue\u2019s side while shouting, \u201cNonsense! Who are you called a pretentious fellow?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue snorted twice and spun around again, shooting out six thunderbeads. The seven or eight enemies around her perished under her sword and she even managed to find the time to mock Ling Tian, \u201cYoung Master Ling, apart from you, is there anyone worthy of this title? Only the officials are allowed to use fire but the commoners are not allowed to light up their lamps?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled and did not stay on this topic with Li Xue, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to care if I am a true gentleman or pretentious fellow. Don\u2019t change the topic! Are you going to give them to me or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue floated up and flew out seventy odd feet, killing all of the Xiao soldiers along the way, \u201cI am just not going to give them to you! Are you going to bite me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian flew into a rage and a white splendor shot out from the Heaven Splitter. The surrounding hundred feet were immediately cleansed and Ling Tian said with his teeth clenched, \u201cAlright, if you dare to not give it to me, you better not regret it in future! When I return, I will carry out the family law to smack your bottom until it becomes raw!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSmack my bottom if you dare! Who is afraid of who?\u201d From afar, Li Xue\u2019s laughter sounded and a series of explosions could be heard.</p><br/><p>These two individuals had actually begun casually chatting in the midst of the battlefield\u2026 Feng Mo and the others didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry. However, despite having a good conversation, the two of them did not stay idle and the number of people who died in their hands was more than in the hands of anyone else.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s figure flashed about like a ghost and a long blood path was carved out. The next moment, Ling Tian appeared in front of Li Xue with his arm stretched out, \u201cGive it to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue snorted and threw out a bag which was on her waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank! Haha\u2026 I can have my fun now\u2026\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s anger was immediately transformed into joy as he dug his hand into the bag, \u201cI shall give you something good as a reward when we return\u2026 err\u2026\u201d His face suddenly contorted in anger, \u201cIt\u2019s all gone?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue chuckled and made a funny face. Waving her right hand, she merrily threw out the last two thunderbeads. \u201cI already passed everything I have to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was thoroughly incensed! However, he was completely helpless against this demoness!</p><br/><p>Following Ling Tian\u2019s arrival and a pincer attack from two directions, the situation of the battle had finally tilted in the favor of the Ling Family. With Ling Tian joining hands with Li Xue and the explosions which Li Xue caused, the enemy\u2019s camp was completely messed up. As the battle dragged on, the morale of the Xiao soldiers was destroyed but the morale of the Ling soldiers burned even brighter.</p><br/><p>In a state of extreme fear, the Xiao soldiers at the outermost rim finally could not hold off the Ling soldiers and their defensive line collapsed. After the first outbreak of fear, this fear would spread across the whole army. More and more soldiers began to escape and the situation began spiraling out of control!</p><br/><p>The loss of those soldiers was like the collapse of a mountain!</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang let out a long sigh as he watched Ling Tian charge at him with killing intent. He then looked around at the escaping Xiao Family soldiers and was completely disheartened. Straightening his blade, he placed it beside his neck and let out a loud laugh, \u201cI never imagined that I, Xiao FengYang, who had never experienced defeat would also face such a day!\u201d</p><br/><p>His hand moved and he was about to commit suicide.</p><br/><p>Dang!</p><br/><p>A small copper coin flew from afar and smashed into Xiao FengYang\u2019s sword. Xiao FengYang\u2019s sword was sent flying and it broke apart in mid-air. Even though Xiao FengYang\u2019s sword was sent flying in time, a deep cut was still made on his neck and fresh blood began spewing out. His body then shook unsteadily and he fell down from the horse!</p><br/><p>Only at that moment could the sound of the coin slicing through the air be heard.</p><br/><p>A skinny black figure shot forward with a speed even faster than an arrow. Before Xiao FengYang landed on the ground this black figure caught him.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian held onto Xiao FengYang\u2019s body with one hand and used his other hand to press onto his acupoints. Following that, a white cloth was wrapped around Xiao FengYang\u2019s neck tightly and Ling Tian let out a roar, \u201cThe Grand Marshal Xiao FengYang has been captured! Those who surrender will not be killed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who surrender will not be killed!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice rolled out in all directions like the waves.</p><br/><p>From afar, Meng LiGe\u2019s beard fluttered lightly in the wind and a smile could be seen in his face. The outcome of the battle had been determined!</p></div>\n</div>"}

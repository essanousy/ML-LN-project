Ling Chen\u2019s body spun once, and her sword that had disappeared mysteriously reappeared back on her hand. Just as the whole group of men were still staring spellbound, the sword had already accomplished its mission. A whole twenty-seven mournful streams of blood sprayed out into the air, with Ling Chen looking as though she had just finished a beautiful dance, exiting the stage. Her white robes had nary a speck of dust on them, and as for the wildly spewing blood, not even a spot of it landed on her clothes!</p><br/><p>In that instant, all the tendons of the twenty-seven men present had been completely sliced! One by one, they fell onto the ground, their screams comparable to the whistle of a steam train going at full blast!</p><br/><p>The remaining ten odd men who were just about to pounce towards her seemed as though they suddenly suffered from some movement stopping witchcraft, as all of them paused in their current stance, be it rushing forwards or brandishing their blades. They seemed to have turned into clay figurines, as all of them stood with wide open eyes and mouths, gazing at the hellish scene before them. No one even noticed the saliva dripping out of their wide open mouths, so frightening and astonishing was the scene before them. Everyone present was filled with despair without exception, together with incredulity!</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu, who had discovered something amiss, stood with her mouth wide open, as her gaze stared straight at Ling Chen. Other than shock, there was a deep grudging hatred in her eyes, a venomous hatred. While she took into account that Ling Chen might possess some sort of martial arts, she never thought that it would be to such an extent. The operation this time was not to assassinate someone, but rather to commit suicide, to be killed. It was the worst fatal disaster the NanGong Family could have brought upon themselves\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, she finally realized how great the disparity was between her and Ling Chen. It was akin to the distance between heaven and earth! But it was because of this that the reality of Ling Chen\u2019s prowess did not scare her till she fainted, but rather fanned the flames of insanity and urgency within herself!</p><br/><p>A woman who fell into the depths of jealousy was not someone that could be reasoned with, no matter how frightening the reality that she faced.</p><br/><p>Li Xue stealthily knocked the last member of the NanGong family onto the ground, and as she floated over, she calmly noticed every single person still present. She who had undergone two lifetimes of experience immediately noticed many things that escaped the gaze of Ling Chen. NanGong TianHu slightly shifting to a position where it was convenient for him to strike, an expert with veins all over firmly gripping onto his sword, as well as two other great experts of the NanGong Family slowly making their way over to Ling Chen while hiding themselves among the crowd of people\u2026</p><br/><p>If Ling Chen was not mentally prepared, suddenly receiving the attacks of these few experts, as well as the remaining over sixty enemies who still possessed some modicum of movement, the results would be irreparable! While Ling Chen\u2019s skills had already achieved a certain realm, able to place herself amongst the first rate experts, her battle experience was far from that level. This sort of experience needed to be honed over time, over long periods of fighting, of hovering between life and death, blood and fire, before it could rise. There was no shortcut!</p><br/><p>The surprising part was that the Ling Chen who possessed unfathomably high martial arts actually had zero experience when it came to such matters. To Ling Chen, this was a fatal loophole, thus Li Xue had to be very careful. Proud as she was, Li Xue had to admit that Ling Chen possessed a special place inside Ling Tian\u2019s heart! If anything happened to her, Ling Tian would definitely go insane, and when that happened, not only would he wipe out his enemies, even allies and his loved ones would be annihilated as well!</p><br/><p>From this point, the decision that the NanGong Family made to attack Ling Chen was indeed the best option! For she was the Achilles\u2019 heel of Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>As such, Li Xue would rather that she got into trouble than to allow Ling Chen to suffer a mishap!</p><br/><p>This was because Ling Chen was the apple of Ling Tian\u2019s eye!</p><br/><p>Thinking this, Li Xue could not felt but feel a sense of sorrow and disappointment. As a woman, she actually had to help her man and risk her life for another of his women, what sort of irony was that? If this was her past life, what sort of preposterous matter would this be?! However, she was doing it so naturally now, as well as being so calm about it\u2026 could it be that her attitude changed when she crossed over to this new world?</p><br/><p>But Li Xue was extremely clear that, no matter what, it was impossible for her to monopolize Ling Tian herself in this lifetime! The consequence of doing so was something Li Xue did not even want to imagine.</p><br/><p>Of course, this sort of incident was an impossibility as well. Even if the correct choice was made by their enemy, in order to carry it out, one had to have the strength to back it up!</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Chen! You\u2019re indeed difficult to deal with! I actually underestimated you all this time.\u201d NanGong Yu let out a bitter laugh, her eyes filled with a chilly frost. \u201cTo think that your martial arts were actually at such a stage! It seems like I\u2019ve most likely lost in today\u2019s operation.\u201d Within her voice, one could hear a hint of dejection.</p><br/><p>\u201cNanGong Yu, I\u2019ve always admired you, especially your intellect and your talents; however, you\u2019ve utterly disappointed me today.\u201d Ling Chen gazed at NanGong Yu, indifferently saying, \u201cYour NanGong Family broke the faith between our two families first, going back on your word and trying to backstab us. Now that things have failed, you guys still have the cheek to come over to seek revenge! Could it be that you display your sense of honor in such a way? Furthermore, you want to use me to perform your dirty deeds! NanGong Yu, you\u2019re also a woman, why resort to such venomous methods, such despicable acts?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the last few words, Ling Chen\u2019s voice went up by an octave, revealing a hint of fury. Not just herself, but for any woman that received such a treatment from NanGong Yu, how could they still survive? Even in death, they would die full of humiliation and shame!</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu slowly nodded her head, staring at Ling Chen with empty eyes, before suddenly focusing into a maddened gaze, \u201cLing Chen! For someone like you, you shouldn\u2019t even be alive in this world! What grounds do you have to have all the men only talking about you? What grounds do you have to be Ling Tian\u2019s beloved? On what grounds? WHAT GROUNDS?!! You\u2019re merely a lowly slave! A slave to be ordered about, a slave that the nobles use to entertain their guests like a prostitute! On what grounds do you have to obtain what you have? What authority do you have, for a slave of low birth such as you to display this image of a saintess in front of me? Huh??!!\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu began to frantically holler out, \u201cI just want to cheapen you! I want to violate you! I just want to tear down this false image of a saintess that you put on yourself, and display your true lascivious image for everyone to see! I want to make sure you are ridden on and trampled by a thousand men, a person whose body even the lowest beggar can enjoy, the filthiest woman on this world!! HAHAHA\u2026\u201d A burst of frenzied laughter rang out, and so intense were her emotions that NanGong Yu actually started to tear up\u2026 and her original delicate and pretty face warped into a perverse look full of maliciousness and sinister happiness\u2026.</p><br/><p>An incident that was destined to never happen, flowed out like water from NanGong Yu\u2019s mouth. A woman that has fallen into insanity could not be understood with normal reasoning!</p><br/><p>Ling Chen immediately quivered with the intensity of the words. While she knew that whatever NanGong Yu spoke of could not happen, but her words had incited a sort of fear within her inner heart, as well as the sky-burning rage and hatred! Ling Chen\u2019s eyes gradually stilled and grew ice cold, her killing intent so strong that it could actually turn substantial\u2026</p><br/><p>Not far off, Li Xue also shivered, muttering to herself, \u201cCrazy! This woman has gone insane! No, from the start, she was already a lunatic\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCareful!\u201d Li Xue screamed out loud, as she flew forwards, swiftly skimming the area.</p><br/><p>Just at that moment, while Ling Chen was shaken by NanGong Yu\u2019s words and had just raised her killing intent, sharp killing intents also rose from three different angles around her!</p><br/><p>NanGong TianHu and the remaining two great elderly experts of the NanGong Family took this chance to move, their target being Ling Chen. Their positions sealed off any form of escape that Ling Chen had, and all three of them immediately put forth their strongest moves, entering the highest realm of the NanGong Family\u2019s famed Sword God Manual: Sword and Body as One! Three razor-sharp sword lights shot towards the same objective, congregating in the center!</p><br/><p>This was the deciding blow of the remaining three experts of the NanGong Family! Everyone knew that even if only one was alive in the end, so long as they killed Ling Chen, the operation would still be a success!</p><br/><p>As such, this blow of theirs held nothing back. It was a blow made with all their lives!</p><br/><p>At the same time, NanGong Yu, who was in front of Ling Chen, behaved like an insane beast as she drew her sword and dashed towards Ling Chen as well, a crazed fierceness on her eyes and smile\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Chen no doubt received a huge shock, hurriedly revolving her Divine Ice Formula to the maximum, her body spinning rapidly within an extremely small area. Her feet constantly intertwined, and as her body spun like a windmill, the exquisite powers of her Divine Ice Formula were emitted in waves without hesitation.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, Ling Chen had already sent out seventy-nine palm strikes! The sound of her palms impacting the bodies sounded out continuously, accompanied by the cracking sounds of bones shattering. The first three experts who had pounced forward each received more than ten palm strikes from her, but they behaved like Ironmen who could not be beaten down, steeling their tenacious fighting spirit to keep forging on, their swords still pointing relentlessly towards Ling Chen even though their sword lights had already been shattered!</p><br/><p>They had to kill Ling Chen at all costs, even at the cost of taking her down with themselves!</p><br/><p>This fighting spirit, this determination, the complete strength of these three people, relying on their vitality to complete this almost impossible move!</p><br/><p>They were this close to succeeding!</p><br/><p>If it was not for Li Xue\u2026.</p><br/><p>With a clear whistle, Li Xue was like the Heavenly General descending onto Earth, as her short sword flashed and carved out a glittering icy river. From the sky down to the ground, it was as though the river had become real, sundering the heavens and earth itself! She protected Ling Chen and herself behind this ephemeral ray of light that formed the river of ice!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

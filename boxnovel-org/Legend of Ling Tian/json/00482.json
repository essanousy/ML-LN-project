He slowly replied, \u201cMine also are still clean and white.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will see red soon.\u201d Ling Tian cynically spoke, \u201cBright red, dark red, vermillion red, as well as blood red!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the time comes for it to be red, it should not be white, neither should it remain white.\u201d Yu ManLou folded his hands behind his back. As he spoke, there was an aura of loneliness behind him, as well as an unspeakable lack of emotion.</p><br/><p>Witnessing the current manner of Yu ManLou, Ling Tian suddenly felt a little suffocated, and could not help but want to knock him down a peg. He indifferently replied, \u201cI heard from Family Head that there is no one in the world that could remain obstructed within the Yu Family\u2019s circle of influence. Could it be that, in the past millennia, this had been so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas there really been no one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s face turned black as he shot a piercing gaze at Ling Tian. He already knew what Ling Tian wanted to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cI seem to have heard before that the Yu Family once had an exceedingly talented elder, called Yu ChaoChen\u2026\u201d Ling Tian unhurriedly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough!\u201d Once the three words \u2018Yu ChaoChen\u2019 was said, Yu ManLou\u2019s face had a great change, seemingly turning a little savage. His hands curled up into fists.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian, however, did not even glance at him, continuing as though he was minding his own business, \u201cI heard that this Elder Yu ChaoChen had martial skills so profound that it was scary, supposedly the top expert the Yu Family had produced in a century. I\u2019m not sure if that was true. However, he seemed to have died under the hands of someone, and the body delivered to the grand hall of the Yu residence, right? I even heard that Family Head you didn\u2019t do anything to that person at all!! Was there really such a thing? If that\u2019s the case, then that person could be considered to have treated the Yu Residence as his very own playground, right?!\u201d Ling Tian still had on a smiling expression when he looked at Yu ManLou, but his gaze of aggressive.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s face grew frosty, as he revolved his killing intent once again. He never would have thought that such a secretive matter could also be uncovered by Ling Tian. That day, when the green-robed fortune teller Ye QingChen had carried Yu ChaoChen\u2019s corpse into the Yu Family, the reactions of his family were overly intense, wanting to chop Ye QingChen down where he stood. Unfortunately, behind him was Heavenly Justice, as well as the Beyond Heavens Sect. Furthermore, Yu ManLou knew that the true killer was the legendary top expert Heavenly Justice, and he was something the Yu Family could not handle. Thus, he suppressed the calls for blood, escorting Ye QingChen personally in leaving, before giving the order that no one was to seek revenge for Yu ChaoChen.</p><br/><p>This was the greatest humiliation the Yu Family had suffered in the past millennium, as well as the greatest humiliation Yu ManLou had received ever since he took the reins as Head. From then on, this became a sort of taboo, and no one dared to breathe a word about this in front of Yu ManLou. To think that such a secretive matter could be dug out by Ling Tian, and to even have salt rubbed in his wound, so how could Yu ManLou not be frustrated!</p><br/><p>Finally dealt this old fox a good blow! Looking at the ashen expression on Yu ManLou\u2019s face, Ling Tian felt unbearably happy, and elegantly concluded, \u201cFamily Head, take care of yourself. This five-year period will pass by in a flash! Ling Tian bids his farewell first.\u201d Cupping his fists, Ling Tian let out merry laughter as he walked past Yu ManLou with light footsteps, floating off to the distance.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had already walked off a long distance, yet Yu ManLou still continued standing in the forest, his expression unreadable. Finally, he spat out three words with great hatred, \u201cBeyond Heavens Sect!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong! The brand-new bench that Ling Tian had been sitting on moments ago splintered into innumerable fragments, flying all around. Yu ManLou clenched his fists as he stared at where Ling Tian had walked off, muttering to himself, \u201cYou have no hope in this upcoming gamble.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Ling Tian walked out of the dense forest, he was greeted with the dazzling rays of sunshine. He slightly paused for a while, tilting his body as his eyes gazed at the spot which he just came out from. His lips curled into a smile as he too muttered, \u201cYou have no chance at all in this gamble!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Yu Family.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou stood ramrod straight at the doorstep, looking at the two black and glossy heads that were deeply bowed before him. His face was full of fury, as well as an unknown bizarre expression.</p><br/><p>The two in front of him were precisely the next successors of the Yu Family. When Yu ManLou returned, Yu LiuShui had just been freed from captivity by his second brother, Yu LiuFeng. As such, he was only wearing his undergarments. Because there would naturally be scruffles as he struggled against his captors, there were many places where the undergarments were torn, giving him the look of a beggar, unkempt beyond words!</p><br/><p>As for the Second Young Master Yu LiuFeng, that idiot probably was not aware of the circumstances, or maybe the Head Deacon did not have time to explain anything to him. All he had was an expression of \u2018I\u2019ve accomplished a great achievement\u2019, his face glowing with pride. He obviously wanted to laugh out loud, but still put on a look of someone who was steady and unflustered. In his heart, he thought that he had achieved a great accomplishment by uncovering the matter between his third brother and the Above Heavens Sect, preventing losses in the family. The biggest reward would be the fact that his third brother would have no more qualifications to fight in the successor battle against him.</p><br/><p>From today onward, his third brother would definitely be banished into the backlines by their father, without the qualifications to compete for anything, while he, being the final descendant, would automatically become the next-in-line for Family Head! Thinking about this, Yu LiuFeng felt as though he was being handed an iced drink on a hot summer day!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou originally had a mind when he came back, to fly into a terrible rage and control those two sons of his a little. After all, even if they did not amount to anything, they were still his sons, and he had to put in a bit of effort in teaching them. However, upon reaching the place and seeing the image of his two sons, Yu ManLou suddenly felt his heart freeze, without even the slightest bit of interest in this matter. Let alone talking about flaring up, he did not even have the mood to reproach them!</p><br/><p>If one compares objects, there would be one thrown away. If one compares people, then one would have to go! Just look at Ling Tian, he wasn\u2019t even seventeen yet! How did the elders of the Ling Family educate him to produce such a talent? Yu ManLou himself was the smartest and best strategist the Yu Family had obtained in a millennium, but why? Why was it that his children that were supposed to succeed him were all so useless? LiuYun, why did he have to leave so early, so quickly?!</p><br/><p>There\u2019s nothing sadder than a withered heart!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou suddenly thought of this phrase. Indeed, the Yu ManLou currently had already completely lost heart with his two sons. Looking at them, he recalled Ling Tian\u2019s words, \u201cI have previously met both of them. In all honesty, they are truly bad cement that can\u2019t hold up a wall! I think that every time you think about how the world that you will reign over in the future will be ruined by them, you will lose all of your motivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bad cement that cannot be used to build! Dog meat that cannot be served anywhere!</p><br/><p>This was the evaluation given by his greatest opponent, to his own flesh and blood! Furthermore, his own opponent was younger than his youngest son by a few years, probably only considered half an adult! However, not only had he assumed responsibility, he had also grown into one of the few experts that stood at the very top of the continent! He had turned into an opponent that he could not underestimate and even admired! The latter had even dared to make a bet with himself!</p><br/><p>Comparing Ling Tian and his sons, Yu ManLou felt so embarrassed that he wanted to bang his head on a wall and die! Especially when he recalled what Ling Tian said with disdain on his face and the demeanor of an expert, then looking at the cringing looks on his one son as well as the stupidly proud look on the other, he wanted to bury himself!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou smiled in sorrow. How could this Yu Family Head, who shook the world with his footsteps, actually have such useless children! If Ling Tian\u2019s words were to be spread outside, how many of his enemies would crow and further gossip about him?</p><br/><p>My decision in the past was wrong. I should not have placed all my efforts on just nurturing LiuYun, allowing the other two to do as and what they liked. However, I did so to avoid the result of the brothers turning against each other after I have left this world! Just like in yesteryear, where I never had any thoughts towards ManTang and ManTian even though my influence was at its peak because I knew that they would never want to threaten my place as Family Head! However, LiuYun\u2019s sudden death left me unprepared. Was my choice that year really wrong?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter ends here. You both may go.\u201d Standing in the same spot for such a long while, the rage on his face slowly receded, only be to replaced with endless sorrow and disappointment. He tiredly massaged his brows, not even glancing at his sons. He had merely waved his hand and spoke those two words.</p><br/><p>Regarding the motives of his second son, how could he not know? He did not wish to reprimand him, for if he was in the shoes of his son, he might have actually done the same thing, just not so obviously and foolishly! As for the actions of his third son, he did not wish to know the reason, and neither did he require a reason. This was because his purpose was so simply put out! What happened had already occurred, and Yu ManLou did not wish to pursue anything, he only felt his body physically and emotionally exhausted when he gazed at his sons.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, Father\u2026.\u201d How could Yu LiuFeng who had used all his tricks to achieve this scenario be willing to let it pass just like that? He thoroughly threw aside his facade of being calm and unflustered, shouting out in panic. He did not understand, his father facing the betrayal from his own son, to the whole family, just what sort of heavy crime was this? So how could his father ignore all and let it pass so easily? Yu LiuFeng immediately argued for what was \u2018right\u2019, as though wanting to send his own brother to the execution grounds!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve already said that it ends here. Did you not hear me clearly?! All of you are to retreat now! Do you not hear me?!\u201d Yu ManLou burst into a rage as he shouted, the veins on his head popping out. \u201cGet out! Scram scram scram!! All of you get the hell out of here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden burst of rage, much like the strike of a lightning bolt, made Yu LiuFeng suddenly have this image in this head, that if he continued staying, it was likely that his father would personally snap his own neck\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Just what should he do?! If he couldn\u2019t control his lust and went out of control at this moment, the consequences would be horrible!</p><br/><p>Taking in a deep breath, Ling Tian felt his heart thumping rapidly as he walked into the interior of the cloth. Little young noble Ling was already standing up straight and wanted to break free from his thin pants. His whole body was burning up from the need to suppress his lust.</p><br/><p>As the three beauties inside noticed Ling Tian\u2019s arrival, they held their breaths with embarrassment.</p><br/><p>The cloth trembled slightly and Ling Tian stopped right outside. As the three ladies saw his fit shadow on the cloth, their hearts clenched up in nervousness and they leaned on each other. Their three heads gathered together and they wanted to bury themselves\u2026</p><br/><p>Such an embarrassing scene\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and Li Xue both turned to curse Yu BingYan, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault! Of all the illnesses to contract, you just had to contract such a weird illness which requires us to be naked in order to cure it! You dragged all of your sisters down into such an embarrassing situation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan was both embarrassed and anxious as she buried her head in her face and said with a barely audible voice, \u201cWhat\u2026 what are you two embarrassed about\u2026 there\u2026 there isn\u2019t any outsiders here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle hussy! You still dare to come up with excuses!\u201d The two ladies exploded and forgot about their shyness.</p><br/><p>Just when they were fooling around with each other, Ling Tian finally took a step in. As the three ladies saw Ling Tian\u2019s robust naked figure, they cried out together and shrunk with nervousness.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian also fell into a daze.</p><br/><p>Young noble Ling finally realized that without witnessing it on his own, it would be impossible for him to visualize such a beautiful scene. In front of him, there were three peerless beauties with their spotless bodies displayed fully before his eyes. In that instant, Ling Tian\u2019s eyes were widened and his jaw dropped as he fell into a complete daze.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and Li Xue were wearing white undergarments and their alluring figures were completely exposed before him. Yu BingYan was dressed in a light pink undergarment and coupled with her snow-white skin, it was as though there was a sea of cherry blossoms in the snow. It was truly irresistible.</p><br/><p>The figures of the three ladies were sleek where it should be sleek and curved where it should be curved. If they had a bit more substance, they would be considered plump. If they had a little bit less, they would be considered skinny. Coupled with their country-toppling beauty and their pinkish cheeks, Ling Tian seemed to have forgotten about everything around him. All of a sudden, he felt a tinge of itch by his nose and when he used his hand to rub his nose, his hand was filled with blood\u2026</p><br/><p>His nose actually bled\u2026</p><br/><p>Even someone like young noble Ling who had seen countless beauties was actually stimulated by the scene before him to the point his nose started to bleed. The intense stimulation could be easily imagined\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was extremely frustrated. It wasn\u2019t as though he had never seen a beauty before in his life. How could he be reduced to such a pathetic state? Could it be that little young noble Ling had been held back for too long? Now he had truly embarrassed himself. Ling Tian quickly wiped away the blood off his nose.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Tian\u2019s pathetic appearance, the three ladies covered their faces and giggled. Ling Chen was still the most thoughtful one and quickly handed Ling Tian a clean piece of cloth.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian quickly wiped the blood off his nose and coughed heavily twice with dissatisfaction at his performance. At the same time, he glared at the other two ladies fiercely as he thought, This young noble has been outside for a full month and has not had any release at all. Now that such a mesmerizing scene is before me, so what if I have a nose bleed? You two lasses actually dare to tease me! After we get rid of BingYan\u2019s Divine Black Negative Meridians, this young noble will take good care of you all. I shall \u2018kill\u2019 two birds with one stone. I cannot let Chen\u2019er off as well! I might as well \u2018kill\u2019 three birds with one stone!</p><br/><p>The temperature in the chamber increased further and Yu BingYan who had the weakest martial arts was completely drenched with sweat. Even Ling Chen and Li Xue who had the Divine Ice Formula were also perspiring!</p><br/><p>The time had arrived!</p><br/><p>With the constraint of time, none of them dared to delay matters any further. Yu BingYan first followed Ling Tian\u2019s instructions and sat cross-legged in front of him. Ling Chen sat a foot behind Yu BingYan and Li Xue stationed herself behind Ling Chen. Behind Li Xue was an airy space which was where the ventilation hole for the chamber was. This was the only place where air could flow out from the room and it would be the only cold place in the room. Only Li Xue who had a profound inner qi and deep foundation in the Divine Ice Formula could be stationed here.</p><br/><p>The four of their faces turned solemn.</p><br/><p>Under Ling Tian\u2019s commands, Ling Chen took out a Great Cyclic Pellet and fed it to Yu BingYan. Then, Ling Tian placed his hands on Yu BingYan\u2019s naked shoulders and transmitted his pure Yang inner qi.</p><br/><p>When the Great Cyclic Pellet had just entered her abdomen, Yu BingYan\u2019s inner core was stimulated by Ling Tian. The medicinal effects of the Great Cyclic Pellet were quickly circulated around her body and into her meridians. Yu BingYan immediately felt as though a loud explosion went off in her body and she let out a muffled groan as a trickle of blood flowed down from her nose.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian controlled this ball of inner qi to flow throughout Yu BingYan\u2019s meridians, and after passing through the top of her head, it rushed down to her inner core. After spinning two times in Yu BingYan\u2019s inner core, the inner qi in Yu BingYan\u2019s body was temporarily transformed into the pure Yang element.</p><br/><p>Throughout the whole process, wherever the Divine Black Negative Meridians were, Ling Tian would try his best to avoid touching them. Thus, in Yu BingYan\u2019s body there was both fire and ice, with the two elements opposing each other. Her face was completely red as though she was being roasted from the inside to the outside. However, her heart was filled with a bone-piercing cold. Without the suppression of her inner qi, the Divine Black Negative Meridians seemed to be furiously expanding their territory and began circulating on its own.</p><br/><p>This was the rebound effect after being suppressed for a long time.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan\u2019s chest was frozen like a block of ice to the point her chest turned purple, but her head and the other parts of her body looked as though they were steaming. Furthermore, the purple patch on her chest seemed to be expanding further.</p><br/><p>The Divine Black Negative Meridians had just rebounded slightly and the medicinal effect of the Great Cyclic Pellet was no longer able to suppress it!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s eyes were no longer filled with other thoughts and he ordered calmly, \u201cLi Xue! Inner pellet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue swiftly flashed over and opened Yu BingYan\u2019s mouth with her left hand. Her right hand then held onto the inner pellet above her mouth. Pricking the inner pellet with a silver needle, she carefully dripped three drops of liquid into Yu BingYan\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>A cool liquid flowed from Yu BingYan\u2019s throat and into her belly and wherever it went past, Yu BingYan would first feel a refreshing feeling before a blazing heat expanded out from her meridians. It was as though an explosion went off within her body and the force of the explosion spread all across her body,</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan let out a groan and bit onto her lips in pain. The violent energy had gone into a complete rampage throughout Yu BingYan\u2019s meridians. In fact, the surface of Yu BingYan\u2019s skin could be seen rising and falling as though there was an unknown living being in her bloodstream!</p><br/><p>The arteries on Yu BingYan\u2019s temples also began to bulge and a green gaseous substance began to appear on all of her pores\u2026</p><br/><p>The pain which Yu BingYan was currently facing could not be imagined! However, this stubborn lady had only bit onto her lips without letting out a single word. She also tried her best to keep her expression calm!</p><br/><p>The long years of torture had already given this frail lady an unbelievable tolerance to pain! In front of her beloved man, she displayed her strongest side and did not wish for her pain to affect him!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian took in a deep breath and the pure Yang inner qi which was currently residing in Yu BingYan\u2019s inner core retaliated. It went along Yu BingYan\u2019s meridians and whenever it meets the violent energy of the inner pellet, Ling Tian\u2019s inner qi would immediately transform into an extremely gentle force to wrap itself around the violent energy. It would then gradually transform back into a pure Yang energy while refining and combining with the violent energy to become one.</p><br/><p>Such a method would not exhaust much of Ling Tian\u2019s inner qi as he was only allowing a small ball of inner qi to roam around Yu BingYans meridians. However, it was extremely exhausting for Ling Tian\u2019s spirit! At this moment, Ling Tian could not afford to make even the slightest mistake. From the very start, Ling Tian had to ensure that his focus was at its peak. He had to switch his inner qi between hardness and softness at any time while monitoring the situation in Yu BingYan\u2019s body. On top of that, he also had to carefully control the route of his inner qi to ensure that it didn\u2019t damage any of Yu BingYan\u2019s healthy meridians.</p><br/><p>Currently, all of Ling Tian\u2019s attention was focused on Yu BingYan. Even if a thousand man army was to start a war beside him, Ling Tian would not be able to notice it!</p><br/><p>When the three drops of energy within the flood dragon\u2019s inner pellet had been fully refined, Ling Tian had already transformed his Divine Shocking Dragon Formula from hard to soft a full 24 times! For any expert in the world currently, even getting them to change the element of their inner qi once would be enough to mess up all of their meridians! Even Justice might not be able to endure such an extreme change in his inner qi and his meridians would probably be tangled up in a mess!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian\u2019s Divine Shocking Dragon Formula originally had the unique capability of undergoing a myriad of transformations. Even in the face of such an impossible task, Ling Tian was able to accomplish it.</p><br/><p>His powerful inner qi went back into Yu BingYan\u2019s inner core again. During this process, Ling Tian still did not invade the territory of the Divine Black Negative Meridians.</p><br/><p>At this moment, all of Yu BingYan\u2019s pores were already starting to turn greenish and her chest was gradually turning dark purple. Furthermore, traces of ice could be seen gathering on her chest. Her lips had turned blueish and she had already fallen into a daze. Apart from her chest, neck, and lips, all other parts of her body were still steaming with heat.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian calmly stabilized the inner qi in Yu BingYan\u2019s inner core. After that, he separated a small needle-like inner qi and tried pricking the Divine Black Negative Meridians beside Yu BingYan\u2019s heart!</p><br/><p>He wanted to test the waters!</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan\u2019s body cramped up\u2026</p><br/><p>That small trace of inner qi retreated quickly but the Divine Black Negative Meridians were still immovable. Although a small portion of frost toxins responded, it was only limited to the outermost layer of the toxins and was negligible. It seemed like the medicinal effects of the Great Cyclic Pellet and inner pellet weren\u2019t enough to shake the Divine Black Negative Meridians!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian gradually retracted all of his inner qi back into Yu BingYan\u2019s inner core. Snapping out from his previous state of extreme concentration, Ling Tian realized that he was already completely drenched with sweat.</p><br/><p>He then shouted, \u201cTriple the energy of the inner pellet!\u201d Three drops were obviously insufficient and Ling Tian decided to increase it immediately! Based on the situation of Yu BingYan\u2019s meridians, even if Ling Tian was supporting her by the side, she would only be able to endure so much. This was also the largest amount of medicinal energy which Yu BingYan could endure! This was also the final time! After this, it would be the time for his pure Yang inner qi to engage the Divine Black Negative Meridians in an all-out battle! He had to stimulate the Divine Black Negative Meridians thoroughly!</p><br/><p>Li Xue did not dare delay and immediately dripped nine drops of the inner pellet into Yu BingYan\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>After giving out his instructions, Ling Tian did not wait for Li Xue\u2019s reply and extended his senses into Yu BingYan\u2019s inner core again, controlling his inner qi to flow once around her meridians!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden the nine drops of flood dragon inner pellet energy exploded forth! The might of this energy was also out of Ling Tian\u2019s expectations. Currently, it was as though ten large tubs of water were poured into a container which could only hold a single tub!</p><br/><p>If it was truly a water tub, if it couldn\u2019t hold all the water, the excess would just overflow from the top. However, the container was now Yu BingYan\u2019s meridians! This was completely out of Yu BingYan\u2019s capacity! If it were to overflow, Yu BingYan would definitely die from her meridians exploding in just a short period of time!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian did not grow anxious and he shut his eyes to deal with the violent energy. He immediately spun the inner qi within Yu BingYan\u2019s inner core into a mini whirlpool to welcome the energy of the inner pellet.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>As the two powerful forces collided within Yu BingYan\u2019s meridians, even Ling Chen and Li Xue who were by the side could feel the impact of this collision!</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan and Ling Tian\u2019s body trembled together and blood began spurting out from Yu BingYan\u2019s mouth and nose! It sprayed out onto Ling Tian\u2019s muscular chest and a trace of blood could also be seen flowing down from Ling Tian\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and Li Xue felt as though their hearts were in their throats as they looked at the other two with anxiousness, ready to take action at any minute.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face trembled as he shut his eyes. While the two sources of energy collided together with each other, they were from the same source after all. As long as the two sources of energy could assimilate with each other, the danger would be nullified. However, it would be extremely challenging for Ling Tian to control this energy afterward!</p><br/><p>A long while later\u2026</p><br/><p>A gigantic whirlpool was gradually formed within Yu BingYan\u2019s inner core and Ling Tian\u2019s attention was fully focused on it. He could even hear the \u2018si si\u2019 sounds being given out by the whirlpool\u2026</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t hesitate any further!</p><br/><p>A red glow flashed past Ling Tian\u2019s face and he circulated all of his inner qi. All of his inner qi was converted into the pure Yang element and gushed into Yu BingYan\u2019s inner core to meld with the whirlpool! The amount of energy in Yu BingYan\u2019s inner core was not one that she was capable of containing. In fact, no one would be able to contain so much energy! Not Yu BingYan, Ling Chen, Li Xue, or even Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>Four Great Cyclic Pellets within a month, twelve drops of energy from the flood dragon\u2019s inner pellet which was far superior to the Great Cyclic Pellet, and all of Ling Tian\u2019s inner qi! If such an influx of energy were to be injected into the body of the number one expert in the world, Justice, he would also explode on the spot for sure!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian tried his best to control the energy to make a cycle around Yu BingYan\u2019s meridians. He then steeled his heart and guided it to charge upwards!</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan\u2019s body trembled and with a bang, the only piece of cloth left covering Yu BingYan\u2019s body had also exploded into pieces.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had still underestimated this source of energy!</p><br/><p>Even if he tried his best to control the energy, he was gradually losing control of it. Thus, Ling Tian decided to go all-out and directed it towards Yu BingYan\u2019s Conception and Governing Vessels!</p><br/><p>He had no other choice! Even if Ling Tian couldn\u2019t use this opportunity to break through Yu BingYan\u2019s Conception and Governing Vessels, he could suppress the energy so he could control it. If he could break through the Conception and Governing Vessels luckily, with the Conception and Governing Vessels\u2019 broad channels, it would be enough to slow down the violent energy and Ling Tian would be able to direct it towards the Divine Black Negative Meridians! At that time, coupled with the energy of the Conception and Governing Vessels, he would be even more confident!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian never expected that the Conception and Governing Vessels would easily break apart under the clash of this powerful energy! But despite this powerful energy breaking through Yu BingYan\u2019s Conception and Governing Vessels, it also damaged her meridians severely!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yu BingYan had truly profited from disaster! If she could remain safe until Ling Tian purged the Divine Black Negative Meridians completely, Yu BingYan would definitely become a top-notch expert in the world!</p><br/><p>After all, breaking through the Conception and Governing Vessels was something that all martial arts practitioners dreamed of and it was also the greatest divide between ordinary martial artists and experts! There were countless individuals who could not achieve such a feat during their life but Yu BingYan was able to do so during the process of treating her injuries\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Tian no longer had the time to cry out in surprise. He quickly controlled the inner qi to weave through Yu BingYan\u2019s Conception and Governing Vessels once. Without returning the inner qi to her inner core, he directed it straight at the Divine Black Negative Meridians beside Yu BingYan\u2019s heart. At the same time, Ling Tian separated a gentle energy to protect Yu BingYan\u2019s heart!</p><br/><p>The upcoming collision would definitely be far more violent than all the previous ones. If Yu BingYan\u2019s heart was not protected, she would probably go on into the afterlife before Yu BingYan could purge her frost toxins!</p><br/><p>It was as though an atomic bomb had exploded in Yu BingYan\u2019s body and the intense collision shook both Yu BingYan and Ling Tian who were connected in spirit to the point blood could be seen spraying out from all their seven orifices! Ling Chen and Li Xue were both shocked, but Ling Tian and Yu BingYan\u2019s mind were currently connected and they paid no attention to what was going on on the outside. Even if the two of them were anxious, they were completely helpless!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt as though he was a sprinting elephant that collided with a train at full speed!</p><br/><p>It was as though an erupting volcano had collided with the icy peaks of the north pole! Ling Tian had almost suffered a mental breakdown!</p><br/><p>The strength within Yu BingYan\u2019s Divine Black Negative Meridians had finally loosened up after this collision. Even the stubborn defenses of the Divine Black Negative Meridians created from a thick layer of frosty energy had finally been shattered. An endless wave of icy energy spread out in all directions like the rushing flood waters. As for Ling Tian\u2019s pure Yang inner qi, it was like a sharp steel awl piercing right into the core of Yu BingYan\u2019s Divine Black Negative Meridians!</p><br/><p>The purplish patch on Yu BingYan\u2019s chest began spreading out towards her limbs at a rapid rate. In just a few short moments, a purplish layer could be seen covering all of Yu BingYan\u2019s skin. At the same time, a layer of bone piercing frost also gradually spread across her body.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the temperature in the chamber was already far higher than the temperature of a sauna. Based on Li Xue\u2019s estimates, it was at least fifty degrees Celsius! The piles of charcoal by the sides of the room were still burning and emitting heat. At the same time, Ling Tian\u2019s Divine Shocking Dragon Formula was fully activated and transformed into pure Yang energy within Yu BingYan\u2019s meridians.</p><br/><p>Despite all of these, the explosion of the Divine Black Negative Meridians could not be curbed! Ice crystals could still be seen on Yu BingYan\u2019s body and even the ground beneath her was beginning to freeze up. The temperature around them also seemed to have plunged down as though they were currently in winter. The burning charcoal by the side seemed to be completely useless!</p><br/><p>With the collision of both cold and hot air, a thick layer of white fog covered the whole room. A short while later, the whole room was covered in a thick layer of fog and one wouldn\u2019t be able to see his fingers even if it was placed a foot in front of him!</p><br/><p>The might of the Divine Black Negative Meridians was completely unimaginable!</p><br/><p>With Ling Tian stimulating the Divine Black Negative Meridians, the Divine Black Negative Meridians had completely exploded in Yu BingYan\u2019s body and the frost toxins had even begun to invade Ling Tian\u2019s body through his arm. Ling Tian\u2019s arm had also gradually turned into a light shade of purple!</p><br/><p>Finally, Ling Tian\u2019s hoarse voice could be heard, \u201cLing\u2026 Chen\u2026start!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen took in a deep breath. Both she and Li Xue cultivated the Divine Ice Formula and this temperature was extremely comfortable to her. Hearing Ling Tian\u2019s instructions, Ling Chen placed her palms on Yu BingYan\u2019s back and fully activated her Divine Ice Formula. She was like an ice whirlpool which was sucking away all of the cold air!</p><br/><p>Her target was naturally the never-ending extreme Yin energy in Yu BingYan\u2019s body!</p><br/><p>The frosty energy flooded towards Ling Chen\u2019s body rapidly and apart from Yu BingYan\u2019s black hair and the place where the Night Illumination Pearls were located, Yu BingYan was completely silver from the layer of frost.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a sigh of relief. After Ling Chen took action, Ling Tian could immediately feel a decrease in pressure from the endless frosty energy. While the difference was slight, it was enough to allow Ling Tian to catch his breath slightly. He circulated his Divine Shocking Dragon Formula at full strength to dissipate the frosty energy from Yu BingYan\u2019s body while injecting his inner qi into Yu BingYan\u2019s body at the same time. Currently, Yu BingYan was like a block of ice and she was already frozen! It was only because Ling Tian\u2019s Divine Shocking Dragon Formula protected her heart and thus preventing her from dying on the spot!</p><br/><p>The Divine Black Negative Meridians condition was indeed incurable in this world!</p><br/><p>Without Ling Tian, even if the number one medicinal saint and expert in the world, Justice, tried to use his pure Yang inner qi to purge Yu BingYan\u2019s Divine Black Negative Meridians, he would probably end up being turned into a frozen corpse together with Yu BingYan!</p></div>\n</div>"}

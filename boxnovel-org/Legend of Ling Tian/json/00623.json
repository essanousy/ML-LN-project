The two of us are only able to come together after going through trials and tribulations. Just as the saying goes, one who has ambitions will definitely fulfill his wishes, cutting off all roads of retreat\u2026 err.. err\u2026 err\u2026 The heavens will not let down the earnest-hearted, we will maintain our hearts for revenge\u2026 err\u2026 BingYan and I would keep each other company every day and are in perfect harmony with each other. We will respect each other in marriage, an affectionate couple flying wing to wing into the horizon, gelled to each other like glue and never separating in our life\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had almost recited the whole of Pu SongLing\u2019s poem without missing a single word.</p><br/><p>The six elders felt all of their hair stand up and goosebumps all over their body.</p><br/><p>If this was said by someone else to praise Yu BingYan\u2019s relationship with Ling Tian, while it was flattery, it was still understandable. However, Ling Tian had actually bragged about it on his own and it was truly amusing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does young noble Ling mean?\u201d Yu XiaoRan quickly interrupted Ling Tian\u2019s endless speech and had the urge to cover his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really can\u2019t bear to let her go.\u201d A look of pain could be seen on Ling Tian\u2019s face as though he was about to have a life or death parting with Yu BingYan. \u201cThis\u2026 BingYan is my wife! How can I bear to let her do something so dangerous?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu XiaoRan\u2019s expression changed and he had already expected that Ling Tian would definitely create trouble for him.</p><br/><p>He then heard Ling Tian continuing, \u201c\u2026However, since the Yu Family is pleading to me earnestly. I really shouldn\u2019t be stopping this matter but the pain in my heart is truly unbearable.\u201d</p><br/><p>The six Yu Family elders cursed together in their thoughts, Who is pleading to you?! Do you think that you are worthy?!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at Yu XiaoRan and said emotionally, \u201cElder Yu, if you were in my shoes, could you bear to send your wife to her death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu XiaoRan was immediately enraged. What is the meaning of this?!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Besides that, there aren\u2019t any benefits either\u2026\u201d Ling Tian let out a desolate sigh, \u201cOnly a fool would agree to something so foolish! While I am not someone intelligent, I am definitely not a fool, right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The six of them were angered by Ling Tian\u2019s shamelessness to the point smoke could be seen coming out from their seven orifices. After talking for so long, you just want to have some benefits? Rather than beating about the bush for such a long time, you might as well say it in a straightforward manner from the start. Your shamelessness is truly unmatched in the world!</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask young noble Ling, cough cough, just what kind of benefits do you want? Just what must we do to let the little princess return with us?\u201d Yu XiaoRan had a belly full of anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cBenefits?! What do you mean by that?!\u201d Ling Tian flew into a rage, \u201cDo you think that the relationship between me and BingYan can be measured by benefits? This is the biggest humiliation to our sincere relationship! This matter shall come to an end right now!\u201d Ling Tian had an angry expression and he looked as though he was thoroughly enraged.</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 this old man didn\u2019t watch my words just now and I hope that young noble Ling will forgive me.\u201d Yu XiaoRan was filled with displeasure as he cursed Ling Tian for erecting a chastity monument despite being a whore. This brat in front of him was without a doubt the most shameless person in the world! \u201cHowever, both of our families are in-laws with each other and if young noble Ling has a problem, you can just let us know. We are not outsiders after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Ling Tian calmed his \u2018anger\u2019 down. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I shall not stand on ceremony.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since when have you stood on ceremony?! the six elders cursed together.</p><br/><p>\u201cA while ago, the Lei Family received news from an unknown source and found out that the little princess of the Yu Family was currently staying in the Ling Family Courtyard. These thieves actually had the guts to invade the Ling Family Courtyard in an attempt to kill BingYan! Our Ling Family fought a bitter battle in order to defeat the assaulting enemies before being able to protect the safety of the little princess.\u201d Ling Tian had a look of grief on his face, \u201cHowever, our casualties were heavy and our Ling Family Courtyard had been almost turned into a wasteland. The accumulation of three generations of our Ling Family was plundered by the Lei Family thieves and we had more than 100,000 casualties.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough cough\u2026\u201d Yu XiaoRan began coughing incessantly.</p><br/><p>How shameless! Too shameless! Yu XiaoRan finally understood what it truly meant to be shameless!</p><br/><p>The Lei Family obviously intended to wipe out the Ling Family Courtyard, what has it got to do with the little princess of our Yu Family? Why is it such that their mission is suddenly to assassinate our little princess? Isn\u2019t the ability of this brat to turn lies into the truth too exaggerated?</p><br/><p>Besides that, while your Ling Family Courtyard isn\u2019t small, holding 100,000 soldiers is complete nonsense! Not to mention having more than 100,000 casualties! If that was truly the case, your Ling Family would have probably been wiped out from the world already.</p><br/><p>Besides that, the Ling Residence wasn\u2019t attacked at all and the accumulation of your Ling Family wasn\u2019t plundered in the slightest. As for the Ling Family Courtyard being turned into a wasteland\u2026 Yu XiaoRan let out a long sigh as he looked around. Have you ever seen such a beautiful wasteland?</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the Lei Family to perform such a deed, they are indeed the enemies of the world! With such malicious intentions of theirs, they are the common enemy of both our Yu and Ling Family!\u201d Ling Tian said with righteousness, \u201cThus, they must pay the price!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat young noble means\u2026\u201d Yu XiaoRan\u2019s face turned ugly. He could already guess what Ling Tian meant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have already begun our revenge operation against the Lei Family but there is a portion of the Lei Family members in your Yu Family\u2019s territory. It really isn\u2019t convenient for us to take action.\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s smile became cold, \u201cI want all the heads of those from the Lei Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of man or woman, young or old! Not a single less!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu XiaoRan took in a breath of cold air and cold sweat filled his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Ling Family has already made the necessary preparations and the rest would be your Yu Family\u2019s affair. However, your Yu Family still has not made a move until now and I am getting impatient.\u201d Ling Tian chuckled coldly, \u201cIf you want me to allow your Yu Family to bring BingYan back, you will have to first hand over the heads of the Lei Family! There isn\u2019t any room for discussion! Of course, you are allowed to reject me as well. The decision will lie in your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu XiaoRan was immediately stuck in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>He already knew that he would definitely face troubles in his trip to Sky Bearing but never expected for the trouble to be such a huge one!</p><br/><p>The Lei Family attacking the Ling Family was under the orders of the Yu Family. However, Ling Tian\u2019s condition was for the Yu Family to hand over the heads of the Lei Family members. If the Yu Family agreed to it, who would dare to work together with the Yu Family again?</p><br/><p>But if they did not agree to Ling Tian\u2019s condition, Ling Tian would use that as an excuse to keep their little princess behind and forbid her from taking part in the generational battle. While the Yu Family wouldn\u2019t necessarily lose because of that, they would be going back on their word. They had already fixed the participants a few years back and Yu BingYan was the only lady in the Yu Family\u2019s younger generation. Wouldn\u2019t they become a joke for the world? Besides that, the Shui Family had an old enmity with the Yu Family and the Yu Family wouldn\u2019t be able to endure the humiliation from such a huge blunder.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, their Family Head, Yu ManLou, wanted to make use of this opportunity to send Yu BingYan to her death so that the Ling Family and Water of Heavenly Wind would be enemies. If they did not succeed\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had insisted that the Yu and Ling Family were opposed to the Lei Family in his words. Could it be that he was supposed to jump out an admit that the Lei Family was working under the orders of the Yu Family? It was impossible for them to do that and if they did, it would be impossible for Ling Tian to allow Yu BingYan to go with them\u2026</p><br/><p>The expressions of the six elders turned bitter. Currently, they no longer had the effort to think about their previous humiliation and had their brows furrowed in frustration.</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 young noble Ling. Cough cough\u2026 the few of us will not be able to make such a decision.\u201d Yu XiaoRan could only choose to stall for time.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s alright. How about this, I will write a letter to your Yu Family Head for him to make a decision.\u201d Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cThere\u2019s no rush at all. I have plenty of time. After all, the decision rightfully lies in the hands of your Yu Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>The six elders were about to burst out into tears. While you have plenty of time, we don\u2019t! Decision rights? What kind of dogsh*t decision rights do we have?!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s brush strokes were like a dancing dragon and his words were like the towering mountains. However, the content of the letter was extremely simple: I want the heads of the Lei Family! All of them!</p><br/><p>Since the Yu Family said that they were rushed for time, Ling Tian decided to not call for his study attendant but write the letter on his own. As the six elders watched Ling Tian pen the letter, all of them looked as though they had eaten a mouthful of sh*t.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian folded the letter and handed it over to Yu XiaoRan with a friendly tone, \u201cAll of you elders are truly the esteemed guests of our Ling Family. I shall make the arrangements to prepare the best guest rooms for all of you. Please do not stand on ceremony and eat whatever you wish. All of you elders can treat this place like your own home. Right, all of you don\u2019t seem to have a lot of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then paused for a moment before reminding them with a tinge of embarrassment, \u201cEven if all of you are busy, it is still important to take care of your physical needs. You will still have to rush back later! If you have some\u2026 special needs\u2026 do not stand on ceremony. While my Ling Family don\u2019t specialize in this industry, we are still understanding individuals. We aren\u2019t too far from the few brothels in the city and there is a secret location to fulfill all of your hidden fetishes\u2026 If Elders are interested, I can point the way for you. While our Ling Family members are concerned about our purity, it wouldn\u2019t be too much for us to point the way to you. Ah ah\u2026 of course, all of you are already getting older and your bodies probably aren\u2019t so needy. Err, I\u2019m sorry for saying something in the wrong way. If there isn\u2019t anything else, I shall take my leave first. If your esteemed family head knew of the benefits that I am offering all of you, he would definitely thank me with a long letter. However, such basic hospitality is still necessary.\u201d Ling Tian said with righteousness.</p><br/><p>Brothels?! Special needs?! Secret locations?! Physical needs?! Yu XiaoRan and the other elders were on the verge of exploding. Your Ling Family still dares to talk about your purity?! When they were about to burst out in rage, they heard about Ling Tian talking about their old age and did not even have the energy to blow up. Regardless of their age, as a man, how would they be able to accept someone talking about their inability? The few Yu Family elders had the urge to use the worst method to prove their abilities! However, they finally managed to suppress their anger with their willpower.</p></div>\n</div>"}

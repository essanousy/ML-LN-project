If you want to fight, then come forth with your full strength! If you cannot win then scram, if you can win, then finish it cleanly and stop dragging it out! What kind of lousy rules are you following?!</p><br/><p>However, this gave Ling Tian an inspiration and he decided to go ahead with it. No matter whom that green-robed person was, if he dared to not use his full strength in the first exchange, then so sorry, with the combined forces of Ling Tian and all his comrades, even if this person was the fabled Beyond Heavens Sect Master, Ling Tian was certain that he had the power to make him regret it for life!</p><br/><p>To spoil my plans, whether you are in the good or evil way, I\u2019ll kill!</p><br/><p>A glint of appreciation flashed in the eyes of that green-robed man! To think that this youth could come to a decision so quickly, immediately targeting and setting up such a perfect formation to kill him! While Ling Jian and the rest might be lost among the crowd, but how could the mysterious person not be able to sense that faint killing intent they exuded?</p><br/><p>The expert sighed once to himself, feeling much regret! This type of battle was one that he wished to partake in the most! But it was impossible at this time.</p><br/><p>From beside Ling Tian\u2019s eyes suddenly came a voice, much like a mosquito buzzing, \u201cKid, you\u2019re ruthless enough! Not bad, but a pity that I can\u2019t accompany you guys to play today. You must be Ling Tian, right? If I exchange moves with you today, I\u2019ll definitely hurt the lives of the five brats there, then it wouldn\u2019t be fun anymore! Heh heh, I\u2019ll look for you someday!\u201d</p><br/><p>Compressing one\u2019s voice into a line! Communicating via a mosquito buzz! He was definitely an expert!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian narrowed his eyes into slits and sent his voice back the same way, \u201cMay I know who is Mister? Why are you here? To say you do not want to exchange moves now, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s too late!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the man didn\u2019t reply. Casting his eyes over, he only saw the green-robed man look towards him with a hint of a smile playing on his lips. Although he remained standing in his original spot, he appeared one moment as mountain that one could only look up to and admire, then akin to the great ocean, which gave the feeling that one couldn\u2019t harm him in the slightest, then again to as if he had become one with the heavens, only faintly discernible like the mist. The man suddenly moved, his body fracturing into tens of thousands of light beams, disappearing in all directions!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sighed, and his right hand signaled to the others to stop.</p><br/><p>And indeed, after that brilliant scene, the person\u2019s image became indistinct, finally disappearing altogether! It was unknown at what point he escaped, but his speed was so fast that he actually left a life-like afterimage!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian remained silent, his face impassive, but his heart was filled with turmoil.</p><br/><p>This person was simply strong beyond his imagination!</p><br/><p>When the other six arrived in front of Ling Tian, a trace of lingering fear was still on their faces. All of them knew that even if they were to fight with the man when he wasn\u2019t prepared, except for a select few, the rest would have to be buried as collateral damage!</p><br/><p>That person\u2019s martial arts could be said to be at the apex!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at the six of them, and suddenly started smiling, \u201cWhat do you think of his skills?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnimaginable!\u201d Ling Jian\u2019s face was only filled with respect! The other five also nodded their heads in unison, a sort of admiration plastered on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cUseless!\u201d Ling Tian scolded them jokingly, \u201cLet me tell you guys, everyone can achieve such a state like that man! The question is whether you have the desire to reach such a stage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could we not want to?\u201d All of them immediately argued.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled in response, \u201cIn the past, you didn\u2019t have an objective, and thus your martial arts were practiced without purpose; now you have a visible goal in front of you! This sort of realm has been reached by someone, and it\u2019s just that you guys haven\u2019t reached it yet.\u201d Ling Tian gave a meaningful smile, \u201cTo actually reach such a state, how much hardship did the person have to suffer in order to achieve it? How many things had he given up, in order to reach such a stage? Go and think about it, when you have the answer, then think about whether you guys are able to do it! Once you are certain, then you just have to continue walking on your current road!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian turned about, putting his hands behind his back as he walked towards the Smoky Thea Tower saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be in front of you guys, always guiding you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The six of them looked at the back of Ling Tian, immediately growing silent. But their eyes burned with a fervent passion!</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan was gazing at Ling Tian with eyes full of respect! Ling Tian always made use of live examples of people and objects to explain concepts to Ling Jian and the others, and this also enlightened Yu BingYan! Only by doing so could he dispel the fear of the man that was left behind in the hearts of Ling Jian and the rest, turning it into the ultimate strength and motivation! And this was merely achieved with a few short sentences!</p><br/><p>To control the situation with such a technique, this was approaching perfection!</p><br/><p>No one was aware of the profound significance these few sentences were to the six of them, not even Ling Tian himself! It was only many years later when the six of them stood at the apex of martial arts that they then linked it to the words that Ling Tian had spoken today!</p><br/><p>\u201cD*mn you!\u201d The moment Yu ManTian saw Ling Tian he immediately jumped up, cursing him! \u201cB*st*rdly gigolo, you played this third master here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Uncle!\u201d Yu BingYan displeasedly cut in, \u201cYou\u2019re already so old, why are you still like this? Brother Tian didn\u2019t even offend you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian immediately choked on his words. He didn\u2019t offend me, but he nearly made me get beaten to death! Then almost shamed to death! And then set a whole series of traps for this Third Master to fall into! They said that a female would support her husband\u2019s family over her own, but surely it\u2019s not to this extent, right? Yu ManTian felt a bit resentful over being chided by his niece.</p><br/><p>Shifting his gaze, Third Master Yu\u2019s gaze fell upon some familiar characters.</p><br/><p>\u201cWahaha, so you fellows came too!\u201d Yu ManTian bounded forward happily. After the many times of sparring, he had developed good relations with these fellows, to the point of being overly attached.</p><br/><p>Not even two steps were taken before Yu ManTian stared in shock, followed by throwing his head back and laughing, \u201cHahaha, you guys are\u2026 grieving scholars? WAHAHAHA\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other side, the six of them were a little embarrassed, angrily staring at the unbridled Yu ManTian. All of them had expressions as though they wanted to beat him up, but Ling Chi recovered the fastest, snapping his fan open as he stepped forward saying, \u201cThird Master Yu, seems like you\u2019ve changed into a new set of clothes! Does your brain still hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Having reopened past wounds, Third Master Yu immediately yelled and swatted a palm towards him, which Ling Chi dodged while laughing.</p><br/><p>Looking at them jesting, Ling Tian had an inspiration, and pulled Ling Jian over, whispering a few words to him, before pulling both Ling Chen and Yu BingYan out of Smoky Thea Tower.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian turned to Yu ManTian, saying, \u201cThird Master, the young noble has just abandoned us, how about going to your Yu Family\u2019s side to take a seat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian casually waved his hands, \u201cOf course you can, wahaha, welcome, welcome! In a while, let\u2019s go attend the scholarly meet as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>The six of them froze in shock, shouting in unison, \u201cWhat! Third Master, you are attending the scholarly meet as well?!\u201d In their tone were obvious hints of shock. They couldn\u2019t imagine someone of Third Master Yu\u2019s character attending the scholarly meet!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian\u2019s hairy face reddened as he raged, \u201cWhat? Looking down on this Third Master? In the past, all my ancestors were erudite pigs , which one of them wasn\u2019t a heaven shaking talent? This Third Master, after all, comes from a family with a literary reputation! An aristocratic family based on ink and brush! If even little brats like you guys can go, why can\u2019t this Third Master attend!\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Master Yu actually wanted to say the words \u2018erudite scholars\u2019, but due to his lack of knowledge, he actually mispronounced it as \u2018erudite pigs\u2019! The six of them immediately suppressed a wave of laughter as they replied, \u201cThen we\u2019ll have to properly admire this third master\u2019s elegance later on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian raised his head proudly, \u201cI\u2019ll make you guys bow to me in respect! To my absolute literary talent!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he accompanied the six of them into the tower; shoulder to shoulder, extremely intimate!</p><br/><p>\u201cEsteemed Young Noble Ling is here!\u201d Gu XiYan was dressed in festive robes and smiled as she walked over. \u201cWhy did I not receive word in advance? All the private booths are already filled, how about I trouble young noble to come over this lowly woman\u2019s sitting area for a rest?\u201d</p><br/><p>Till now, Gu XiYan was unaware that Ling Tian was the black-robed man that day, so she merely greeted Ling Tian as per normal and even sent a few coquettish glances his way. However, this incurred the jealousy of Yu BingYan and Ling Chen, who sent a jade hand snaking their way to both sides of Ling Tian\u2019s waist, giving it a good pinch and twist. Ling Tian drew in a cold breath through gritted teeth. Seems like there would be another two patches of purple on his waist tonight, but hey, at least they were evenly proportioned on both sides! He couldn\u2019t help but smile through the pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cTower Master Gu.\u201d As things were, there was no need for Ling Tian to continue hiding. \u201cThis young noble has booked the Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion.\u201d This sentence was spoken using the voice of the black-robed man that night to Gu XiYan.</p><br/><p>Gu XiYan immediately recognized the voice, and her eyes shrank as her voice trembled, \u201cAh? This\u2026 I didn\u2019t know it was the young noble who had arrived\u2026 begging for your forgiveness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian indifferently replied, \u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Wonderful! This is the outcome of you trying to snatch someone\u2019s wife!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then turned around and said gently, \u201cMy dear wife, the matters have been settled and even if crown prince DongFang wants to snatch the wife of another in the future, he won\u2019t have the ability to do so. Shall we leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue responded with a soft \u2018Mmm\u2019 and the hands covering her face tightly eased up slightly. At the same time, her face flushed red upon hearing Ling Tian call her \u2018my dear wife\u2019. Ling Tian then laughed heartily and grabbed the reins of Xiao YanXue\u2019s horse in his hands. With a light kick, both the horses began galloping forward.</p><br/><p>Seeing how the guards in front of him were standing in a daze, Ling Tian exploded forth with killing intent and shouted, \u201cAre the rest of you not going to form up into a formation to send my wife and I off? Do you still want to compare notes with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue burst out laughing and scolded, \u201cDarn tyrant!\u201d However, the way she looked at this \u2018darn tyrant\u2019 was filled with love and care.</p><br/><p>The dozens of guards in front of Ling Tian trembled involuntarily and obediently split up into two groups. Their actions were extremely stiff as though they were wooden puppets.</p><br/><p>\u201cA bunch of idiots! The goose winged formation! Don\u2019t you guys know what the goose winged formation is? A bunch of useless idiots!\u201d Ling Tian scolded, looking like a military instructor flaunting his prestige in the camps. He then left toward the horizon with Xiao YanXue by his side\u2026</p><br/><p>Along the way, Xiao YanXue had a big smile and was obviously in an extremely good mood. From time to time, she would look at Ling Tian sweetly with happiness welling up in her heart. Her beloved man had finally stood up to protect her today. Furthermore, his fury had also shown how much he cared for her. Thinking about that, Xiao YanXue grinned from ear to ear.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue was truly satisfied to see the lecherous profligate being taught such a miserable lesson!</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019ge, you are truly so mighty\u2026\u201d Xiao YanXue flattered.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough\u2026\u201d Ling Tian began coughing incessantly. In his memory, the word \u2018mighty\u2019 shouldn\u2019t be used in this manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter teaching this b*st*rd a lesson today, we shall see if he still dares to go out and snatch ladies!\u201d Xiao YanXue was full of joy and made a funny face at Ling Tian\u2019s frowning expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cErr, even if he wants to snatch the ladies, he doesn\u2019t have any tool to use.\u201d Ling Tian burst out laughing, \u201cWhat is the point of talking about such trash?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Tian\u2019ge, I love it the most when you stand up for me.\u201d Xiao YanXue looked as though she was eager to jump onto Ling Tian\u2019s horse. \u201cWhen we are at Sky Bearing, shall we find a few more profligate young masters to teach them a lesson?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian rolled his eyes, \u201cLass, the number one profligate young master in Sky Bearing is right before your very eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 that\u2019s right\u2026 hahaha\u2026\u201d Only then did Xiao YanXue remember about Ling Tian\u2019s fame and burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at this reckless lass beside him. You still want to teach the profligate young masters of Sky Bearing a lesson? When we are at Sky Bearing, this profligate young master here shall eat you up!</p><br/><p>In front of them was the entrance to a mountain pass, and after this mountain pass, the road would be split into three directions. One would be to Sky Bearing, the other Northern Wei, and the last towards the southeast direction. If Ling Tian went along the path towards Sky Bearing, he would be on his way home.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Ling Tian halted his horse and said, \u201cStop! A large group of troops is approaching on horse. I wonder where they are coming from?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue hurriedly stopped her horse and looked at Ling Tian with a pair of doubtful eyes.</p><br/><p>With Ling Tian\u2019s cultivation and inhumane hearing, he was able to hear the troops who were coming from afar. The rumbling sound of horses coming from the southeastern direction.</p><br/><p>Could they be from the Xiao Family? This was Ling Tian\u2019s first guess.</p><br/><p>Thinking about Xiao YanXue\u2019s identity, Ling Tian had no choice but to be careful. After all, this lass had escaped from her house. Looking at her, Ling Tian said solemnly, \u201cThey are coming from the southeastern direction and there are four to five hundred men.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Xiao YanXue grew flustered, \u201cThen\u2026 let us hide first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was elated in his heart. This lass was indeed afraid. The two of them then swiftly hid behind a few trees at a bend. While they would be able to see the incoming troops clearly, if the incoming troops did not purposely turn their head around, it would be impossible to spot them. In order to be safe, Xiao YanXue hastily covered both Ling Tian and her face up with a mask.</p><br/><p>The sound of the horses\u2019 hooves rumbled and a group of more than a hundred horses galloped past them towards the road heading to Northern Wei\u2019s Bright Jade City. They came and left like the wind, kicking up a huge dust cloud behind them.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue stared at the passing troops without blinking and a change of expression could be seen on her face.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian whispered in her ears, \u201cAre they familiar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though the current atmosphere was extremely tense, Xiao YanXue almost burst out laughing. Just what was Ling Tian asking? Rolling her eyes at him, Xiao YanXue replied, \u201cThey are from my family. These men are the hidden forces of my family. The first few who passed by us are their leaders and all have the surname \u2018Meng\u2019. Isn\u2019t that a strange surname? I don\u2019t think you will be able to find this surname among the commoners.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then muttered, \u201cYour family is probably unable to order these men around right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue\u2019s eyes widened in shock, \u201cHow did you know? They are indeed a special bunch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian only responded with a smile. When these troops went past them, Ling Tian could already tell that these troops were definitely the elites of the elites. From the dense killing intent emanated from each of them and the resolute eyes of every soldier, they were probably trained to be death troops! Furthermore, each and every single soldier had a decent attaintment of martial arts with the cultivation of the few in front being exceptional. These men were probably the secret force trained by Above Heavens over the years.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue let out a breath and was about to stand back up, only to be pressed down by Ling Tian. \u201cWait! There are more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that, another group of troops rushed past them and only after a full five groups went by did the place fall back into silence.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian watched the departing troops with a solemn expression and asked, \u201cHow many of such men does your family have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue frowned for a moment and calculated in her heart before giving an uncertain response. \u201cAbout five thousand? Perhaps more but I know that there are at least five thousand of them. After all, I do not really come into contact with these things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian responded with an \u2018oh\u2019 before falling silent. Then an idea came to his head. Why are these people going to Northern Wei at such a time? Furthermore, all of them are so filled with killing intent\u2026 Ling Tian began to laugh weirdly.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue asked curiously, \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nothing much.\u201d Ling Tian chuckled and began singing, \u201cLet\u2019s go home\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDarn it!\u201d Xiao YanXue rolled her eyes at Ling Tian. Thinking about how they were about to reach Sky Bearing, Xiao YanXue realized that she would definitely have to meet Old Madam Ling and Ling Tian\u2019s mother. What would they think of a lady like her following Ling Tian back at that time? Thinking about that, Xiao YanXue grew nervous in her heart and the thought of interrogating Ling Tian had completely disappeared\u2026</p><br/><p>After they traveled for some distance, Ling Tian frowned, placed his finger in his mouth and let out a loud whistle which startled Xiao YanXue. Following that, Ling Tian let out a strange tone which was sometimes high pitched and sometimes low pitched. Xiao YanXue was at a complete loss. Did my beloved man suddenly go crazy? Just when she was in a state of anxiousness, a black figure dove down from the sky and a black hawk landed on Ling Tian\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>It turns out that Ling Tian had discovered the arrival of this hawk and thus let out a unique tune to summon it. The hawk perched itself on Ling Tian\u2019s shoulders firmly with its eyeballs rolling about in a mischevious manner. Xiao YanXue felt that it was extremely adorable and wanted to raise her hand to stroke it. However, the moment she raised her hand up, the hawk stretched its wings and lowered its beak as though it was about to peck on her hand. Startled, Xiao YanXue quickly retracted her hand.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian burst out laughing and knocked the hawk lightly on the head and the hawk cried out with a tinge of dissatisfaction. While Xiao YanXue grew more and more fond of the hawk, she did not dare to touch it.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stretched out his hand and grabbed the small hawk into his hands. The hawk then let out an obedient and helpless look but did not resist at all, allowing Ling Tian to retrieve a small bamboo container from its leg. After Ling Tian let go of it, it let out a clear cry and disappeared into the distance like a bolt of black lightning.</p><br/><p>Looking at the departing hawk, Xiao YanXue looked to the sky with a face full of envy. Ling Tian laughed out loud and said, \u201cIf you really like it that much, I can find a few baby hawks to accompany you when we are back at Sky Bearing.\u201d Xiao YanXue burst out into cheers and quickly agreed with what Ling Tian said.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shook his head helplessly and took out a slip of rolled up note from the bamboo container. After unrolling it carefully, Ling Tian was certain that the handwriting on it belonged to Miss Li Xue. After all, not a single person in this generation would probably have a handwriting as ugly as hers\u2026</p><br/><p>Such a beautiful lady with such a wonderful upbringing and literary depth. To think that the young princess of an aristocratic family from his previous life would actually have such hideous handwriting. It was just unimaginable how this lady of two lifetimes did not have any improvements in her handwriting. Furthermore, she was writing with a lead pencil\u2026</p><br/><p>How should we take care of the Shui Family b*st*rds?</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t anything before or after those words and only these ten words. It was the classic Li Xue\u2019s style. I wonder how those Shui Family fellows provoked this female demoness? To think that they were able to anger her to such an extent!</p><br/><p>Ling Chen had always been the person in charge of contacting him in the Ling Family Courtyard, and Li Xue must have been truly incensed for her to contact him personally. Furthermore, she also displayed her supernatural and uncanny penmanship and used simplified Chinese. Even if someone were to intercept this note, it would be impossible for anyone else to recognize the words on it. It was only because of Ling Tian\u2019s robust literary education from his previous life that he was able to understand what was written on it\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was extremely curious. It seems that it may be the right time for me to return.</p><br/><p>Seeing the weird expression on Ling Tian\u2019s face, Xiao YanXue could not help but grow nervous and asked, \u201cDid something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cNothing big. But we will have to rush back quickly or someone will be unable to sit still.\u201d At the same time, Ling Tian was confident that even if anything happened, Li Xue, Ling Chen and Ling Jian would definitely be able to handle it without any issue. Even if the men from Above Heavens came to attack them, they would only suffer in the hands of these three experts. The only reason why Li Xue was so frustrated was probably because the Shui Family still had other uses to him and it wasn\u2019t appropriate for her to teach them a lesson lest she spoil his plans.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

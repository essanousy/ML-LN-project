An irreconcilable hatred!</p><br/><p>Who was Yu ManLou? He naturally saw all of this and was angered to the point he began to tremble. He swept a white glass onto the ground and smashed it into pieces. However, his anger was not quenched fully, and right when he wanted to find something else to smash, he realized that he had lost control of his emotions. He quickly circulated his inner qi to suppress his emotions, and blood rushed to his head to the point his whole face flushed red.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s words were akin to a venomous seed which had taken root in his heart. As time went by, it also began to sprout just as Ling Tian had planned\u2026</p><br/><p>This move of Ling Tian was sinister indeed and capable of killing someone without making a move. However, even if Yu ManLou was aware of that, he had no choice but to fall into the trap! Thus, Yu ManLou was both frustrated and heartbroken with his emotions in a complete mess.</p><br/><p>\u201cHead Deacon.\u201d Yu ManLou growled in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate is here.\u201d The Head Deacon took a step forward with unease. At the same time, his heart was pounding as though there were a hundred deer galloping in his heart. He naturally knew what he did between both the young nobles, and he could also guess the reason why Yu ManLou was calling for him. Thus, he was immediately flustered.</p><br/><p>In the Yu Family, Yu ChaoRan was considered the most senior person and he could even be considered to be Yu ManLou\u2019s uncle. Furthermore, Yu ChaoChen was also his biological brother and it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that he held a high status in the Yu Family. But in front of this merciless Family Head, he would never dare to display his displeasure. After witnessing more than ten years of their Yu Family\u2019s bloody history, Yu ChaoChen was extremely clear just how heartless this seemingly magnanimous Family Head of theirs truly was. Ever since Yu ManLou took over the Yu Family, he had never shown mercy in killing those who needed to be killed.</p><br/><p>Thus, Yu ChaoChen would never dare to display the slightest bit of disrespect in front of his Family Head. At the same time, he would never dare to flaunt his seniority and consider himself as Yu ManLou\u2019s uncle. He knew that his Family Head didn\u2019t like that!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s piercing glare was fixed coldly on Yu ChaoRan and he did not say a single word for a long time. However, Yu ChaoRan was already covered with a cold sweat at this moment. His glistening sweat rolled down slowly off his cheeks, and in just a short moment a puddle of sweat could be seen forming under Yu ChaoRan\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cHead Deacon seems to be very busy recently.\u201d Yu ManLou finally opened his mouth and said with a tinge of frustration, \u201cYou are already getting old and shouldn\u2019t tire yourself out!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Head Deacon trembled before replying hoarsely, \u201cYes. Thank you Family Head for your concern. This subordinate will remember Family Head\u2019s words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou continued to glare at him for a moment before retracting his gaze. Let everything come to an end here. Since I don\u2019t plan to punish both of my sons, why should I make things difficult for their assistant? In Yu ManLou\u2019s heart, Yu ChaoRan was far more important than both his sons at this moment. For no other reason but because Yu ChaoRan was still of use to him right now.</p><br/><p>Feeling his Family Head\u2019s gaze shift away from him, Yu ChaoRan let out a sigh of relief. As his senses eased up, he suddenly felt a chilly feeling and was shocked to realize that his clothes were already drenched from his sweat.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou let out a long breath and in the ears of Yu ChaoRan, it sounded like a long sigh. He could not help but feel his heart tighten up again only to hear Yu ManLou\u2019s calm voice, \u201cI heard that the previous prime minister of Northern Wei has a daughter in his residence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ChaoRan was completely oblivious as to why his Family Head would ask such a question and could only reply carefully, \u201cYes, this subordinate has also heard of her before. It is said that she is sixteen this year and has the title of number one beauty in Bright Jade City. However, this old man has never seen her before. For Family Head to ask about her, does Family Head intend to propose a marriage for the two young nobles?\u201d</p><br/><p>A rare look of embarrassment flashed past Yu ManLou\u2019s face before he remarked in a cold voice, \u201cHow can those two little beasts be worthy of her? Mmm, if that\u2019s the case, choose an auspicious date and fetch her in directly.\u201d Yu ManLou said that both his sons were not worthy of her but still insisted on fetching her into the Yu Residence. If that\u2019s the case, wasn\u2019t it extremely obvious who the groom would be?</p><br/><p>Yu ChaoRan\u2019s face cramped up as though he was trying to hold something back and said respectfully, \u201cYes.\u201d He then pondered for a moment, \u201cThe eighth of this month is an auspicious date suitable for getting married. Hmm, would it be too rushed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou responded with an \u2018oh\u2019 before asking, \u201cIs it very rushed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ChaoRan felt his heart skip a beat as he chuckled, \u201cNot rushed, not rushed at all and there is definitely sufficient time.\u201d At the same time, he grumbled in his heart, It is already the third of the month and even the marriage of an ordinary peasant would require at least three months of preparations. right? Since the other party is the daughter of the ex-prime minister, we should at least go through the proper rites, right? Even if we want to speed things up, it would still take half a year at the very least! However, it seems as though his Family Head cannot wait any longer already! Just what was going on with the Family Head?!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou turned around and noticing the queer expression on Yu ChaoRan\u2019s face, he asked, \u201cWhat are you laughing at? Is this matter very funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 this\u2026 this subordinate doesn\u2019t dare.\u201d Yu ChaoRan was frightened to the point he began sweating again, \u201cThis subordinate will go and arrange matters immediately.\u201d He then escaped hurriedly.</p><br/><p>In the mouth of Yu ManLou, the daughter of a prime minister was no different from the daughter of an ordinary farmer. As long as he said that he wanted to marry her, she must enter his Yu Family. Furthermore, everyone was certain that even if he were to say \u2018immediately\u2019 instead of in a few days, this matter would be accomplished without any effort. Even if effort was required, the ones putting in the effort would definitely be others. After all, Yu ManLou was someone who was only concerned with the outcome and not the process.</p><br/><p>In the Northern Wei territory, the Family Head of the Yu Family enjoyed a status that was a hundred times greater than any imperial family member! So what if she is the prime minister\u2019s daughter? Furthermore, he was only a former prime minister!</p><br/><p>Seeing the Head Deacon leave as though he was escaping, Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes seemed to have been lit up with two ghostly flames.</p><br/><p>Yu Family Head is going to take a concubine!</p><br/><p>While this piece of news was intentionally being concealed, it still spread throughout the city like the wind. In just a single night, the whole Bright Jade City was aware of this matter. Naturally, it would also enter Ling Tian ears.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ling Tian\u2019s first reaction was to spit the mouthful of tea he had just drank onto Xiao YanXue\u2019s face. He angered her to the point steam could be seen emitting from her head and she wanted to pounce onto Ling Tian to give him a good beating again.</p><br/><p>After Xiao YanXue knew that there wasn\u2019t going to be any more danger, she immediately pestered Ling Tian to remove her disguise. The moment her disguise was removed, she rushed straight into her room to put on a fresh set of makeup, leaving only after she confirmed that her beautiful appearance was regained. Just when she walked in front of her beloved man with the intention to flaunt her beauty, she was greeted with a mouthful of tea\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian did not know whether to laugh or cry. He never imagined that beneath that old man\u2019s dignified appearances, he was actually such a hasty individual. However, Ling Tian also respected the fact that Yu ManLou could actually accept the advice of an enemy.</p><br/><p>Of the millions of people in the world, how many would be able to accept another\u2019s advice so easily? Furthermore, such characters were even rarer when only considering martial arts experts. Especially a peerless expert like Yu ManLou who was even the overlord of a territory. In his previous life and this, Ling Tian was certain that only Yu ManLou would be able to accept the \u2018disgusting\u2019 advice of his enemy.</p><br/><p>If Ling Tian were to be completely honest with himself, he knew that it was impossible for him to accept his enemy\u2019s advice after being \u2018humiliated\u2019 by his enemy.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou, a truly extraordinary individual and worthy to be my greatest opponent.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue flusteredly cleaned herself up and upon seeing Ling Tian holding in his laughter so badly, she thought that Ling Tian was mocking her. Thus, she took a step forward and grabbed him at his collar, \u201cAre you crazy?! What are you laughing for? Shut up! You\u2019re not allowed to laugh at me! Be serious!\u201d</p><br/><p>She then realized that Ling Tian\u2019s expression really changed after her words. He became strict, respectable and full of wariness\u2026 such an expression made Xiao YanXue truly flustered. She didn\u2019t know what could have happened to make her beloved man, who was the proud ruler of a territory at such a young age, have such an expression! Could it be that my words were truly that effective?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Xiao YanXue let go of Ling Tian and asked softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu ManLou is taking in a concubine.\u201d Ling Tian waved a slip of paper in his hand and said with an odd expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d Xiao YanXue was startled and she began to stutter, \u201cYu\u2026 Man\u2026 ManLou\u2026 is going to\u2026 take in a\u2026 a concubine? He\u2026 he\u2026 he is probably past his fertile age right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet, it seems that he is only forty-nine!\u201d Ling Tian said.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot yet fifty? Forty-nine\u2026 my goodness, is that any different from being fifty? I wonder who was the unlucky fellow who gave him such an idea? An old man like him is going to ruin a young lady!\u201d Xiao YanXue was furious!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian responded with an awkward expression, \u201cI think that I am that unlucky fellow who caused this incident. Yu ManLou was probably urged on by me to take a concubine\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His sleeve followed soon after, draping like a blanket over her, as he exclaimed in mock anger, \u201cWhy are you wriggling so much? Go and sleep properly!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no vulgar connotation to his words, merely the tone of an elder brother chiding his younger sister, full of love and care. Li Xue seemed to be intoxicated with such a feeling, pursing her lips and obediently letting out an \u2018en\u2019 sound before she delved into Ling Tian\u2019s bosom. She found a comfortable spot and quietened down.</p><br/><p>Gently supporting her body, Ling Tian lowly sighed, as he looked out in the vast empty sky as well as the clear and pristine moon, its hazy light shining down and illuminating the vast mountains and rivers, as though purifying them\u2026</p><br/><p>A strange feeling started to form on his chest, a cool yet wet feeling. Li Xue\u2019s arms were tightly wrapped around his waist and her delicate figure was trembling non-stop as she sobbed silently. Her tears flowed without stopping, and before long there was a huge wet patch on Ling Tian\u2019s chest, and it was even showing signs of increasing\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could only sigh to himself and tighten his embrace\u2026</p><br/><p>The night went by in silence, and Ling Tian knew that Li Xue had to give vent to the guilt she had always kept in her heart, thus he patiently held onto her. Ling Tian sat still for the whole night, just as Li Xue noiselessly sobbed for the whole night!</p><br/><p>As dawn broke and a cold breeze rolled over, Li Xue finally ended her crying spree and had vented all her conflicting feelings. She raised her head as the wind tickled her nose, revealing her veil that was soaked in her tears. The veil dropped off due to the weight, revealing two red and swollen eyes akin to ripe peaches, with traces of tears on her face. At this time, she resembled a kitten with a dirty face.</p><br/><p>Li Xue lowered her head in embarrassment as her face turned red. After that she seemed to realize that she had just displayed her ugly self in front of Ling Tian, and exclaimed, immediately covering her face with her hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow ugly!\u201d Ling Tian jeered. \u201cJust look at you, your face looks similar to that of an abandoned dirty kitten. If people were to see, they would think that this great noble Ling here had bullied you. Sigh, I really worry how are you going to find someone to marry with that face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue immediately drummed her feet on the ground in anger, before throwing herself and covering her face in Ling Tian\u2019s chest, snorting, \u201cWho\u2019re you calling ugly? Who did you say can\u2019t marry anyone?!\u201d As she spoke, her hands had already energetically snaked to Ling Tian\u2019s waist, twisting at the flesh there.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m ugly, I\u2019m the ugly one, I\u2019m the ugliest one\u2026 oh my lord, why do all of you women always like to target the same place?\u201d Ling Tian could only plead for mercy.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou women..? Hmm??\u201d Li Xue narrowed her eyes dangerously. \u201cI almost forgot, this great noble Ling here has power and influence and also looks so elegant and suave, you definitely have crowds of wives and concubines in your house, with beauties as plentiful as the clouds, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you still need to mention it?\u201d Ling Tian stuck his head up in pride, \u201cYour brother\u2019s charm can\u2019t be denied! Women will run back to their houses the moment they see me, and will not come out even if they were hit using clubs. Aiya sssss\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still dare to say! You d*mned stud!\u201d Li Xue immediately attacked Ling Tian\u2019s waist in the most ruthless manner, here a 180-degree twist, then turning into the fabled 360-degree twist as she spat out.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a wail of misery, pleading for forgiveness. This was not faked, as this move made by women could be said to be a male\u2019s \u2018greatest pain\u2019! Even an immortal godly body could not protect you from the pain!</p><br/><p>Li Xue angrily snorted and turned her head sideways, fuming and ignoring him.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could only smile helplessly in response, then suddenly let out a long and heavy sigh, as though all the unfavorable things from the ancient times had suddenly landed upon him. The sigh was unbearably heavy and miserable\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you sighing without rhyme or reason?\u201d Li Xue indeed fell for the trick. While she might have an intellect above most people, when it came to matters about Ling Tian, her IQ would take a nosedive. She immediately turned back to face him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTired! I\u2019m really tired!\u201d Ling Tian sighed, feeling the fatigue from all parts of his body as he continued, \u201cYou might not know this, but the me in the past life never did actually have any ambition to aim for something. As such, I ended up with such a miserable ending. At the point where I knew my life was as good as ended, I then realized that in this world it does not matter whether or not you have an ambition, there will still be people who will not let you go! Even if you back yourself to a corner, so long as you are still breathing, there will be people who will go after you! Because only the dead are no threat! As such, the moment I came to this world, I\u2019ve always reminded myself of one thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s gaze was deep, \u201cWhat should be mine, will be mine; if anyone wants to snatch it from me, I\u2019ll kill them! As long as I take a fancy to it, even if it doesn\u2019t belong to me, I\u2019ll still snatch it. As long as it falls into my hands, then it\u2019s mine! I\u2019ve slowly walked to where I am now, but I\u2019ve never thought that what I needed to snatch would actually be the entire world below the heavens! I\u2019m really perplexed now. If I successfully snatch all below the heavens, then what else can I snatch? What else can I fight for? What else is there that will catch my attention?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian actually wanted to just use a small trick to tease Li Xue and solve the embarrassing situation, but he somehow got affected by his emotions and got carried away.</p><br/><p>Li Xue bowed her head down, deep in thought, and only quietly replied a few seconds later, \u201cActually, there\u2019s no need to snatch, nor is there a need to decide what belongs to whom. A possession, at the end of the day, is merely an object in the hands of a person. Who the person is who holds it is the important part. This reasoning should have been understood by us a long time ago, even if our hearts refuse to believe in it, at least for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on this reasoning, whether it is our past world or this new place, it is something too cruel for the people to take in.\u201d Ling Tian disappointedly replied, \u201cThe emotions and feelings between people are actually too sinister.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn chaotic times, heroes contend for supremacy. This has always been the case!\u201d Li Xue smiled sweetly. \u201cUnless you can establish a unified empire, only then can the majority of the commoners be spared of their miserable fates! As long as there is chaos, there will definitely be war, and with war, plundering and robbing will be commonplace. These things can never be avoided! However, under a unified empire, there will definitely be people that can avoid such a cruel fate! Although even under a unified empire, there will definitely still be people who are unable to avoid this fate. This is something that you can\u2019t change even if you become a god!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be able to put an end to this chaotic time could be considered as a meritorious act already,\u201d Li Xue finally concluded. \u201cWith your knowledge and the memories of your past life, it could be considered the best outcome one could ask for if you were to be the one to put everything to an end. Maybe, this responsibility could even be the original reason why you came to this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cResponsibility?! My responsibility?\u201d Ling Tian burst into laughter, snorting disdainfully at this concept!</p><br/><p>Li Xue let out a sweet smile and changed the topic, \u201cYesterday when you were discussing the terms and conditions with DongFang JingLei, you were quite the generous person.\u201d she said with some veiled intentions.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a knowing smile in response, \u201cYou mean the fact of promising him an area of hegemony, like a country within a country?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue nodded and spoke while in deep thought, \u201cAs it seems, DongFang JingTian seems to be more ambitious as compared to DongFang JingLei, but the latter is definitely not as simple as he seems. If through your assistance he is allowed to gain strength, then I might not find it surprising even if he turns back to bite you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI too will not find it strange.\u201d Ling Tian indifferently replied, \u201cBut he will forever not possess enough strength to go against me! So long as he agrees to my terms, it will be an impossibility for him! I will never give anyone the chance to betray me, not even a single thread of chance! As for allowing him to be the local tyrant for a country within a country? That will have to wait until the heavens calm down before we can discuss anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed softly, but it was full of icy cold killing intent!</p><br/><p>Li Xue sighed once, \u201cWhat you say makes sense. If he doesn\u2019t agree, then he only can watch helplessly as his brother gets devoured. If he agrees, then even if he waits until the day that the world is unified, his status ultimately only comes from your mouth in the end. It seems like I\u2019m overthinking it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed in response, before standing up. \u201cIf I calculate properly, Justice should have long left the scene, and it\u2019s time for us to go and admire the scene of the number one expert\u2019s battleground. At the same time\u2026 cough cough cough, I say, Li Xue, you should go and wash your face. I admit that you\u2019re a beauty, and while you might not be inferior to those famed beauties, after crying for a night you still need to wash off those marks, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! Saying that I look like a dirty tabby cat again!\u201d Li Xue flushed red immediately, stamping her feet in anger, \u201cYou\u2019re hateful!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Ling Tian had long flitted away quickly, and his voice sounded from afar, \u201cAnyways, you can help me wash my clothes as well\u2026 yesterday you cried so much that it could form a river, and now all my clothes are wet, so they\u2019re pretty uncomfortable to wear\u2026 hahaha\u2026\u201d Amidst his laughter, Ling Tian had long fled as far as he could.</p><br/><p>From behind, Li Xue was totally embarrassed, chasing after him with a tomato-red face!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the disastrous mess in front of them, Ling Tian and Li Xue both suffered from a great shock!</p><br/><p>Was this something that a person could cause?</p><br/><p>On the small hill, the center of it was a huge big hole, at least twenty to thirty feet in depth, radiating out in a bowl-shaped depression. It would still be acceptable if it was just earth, but this was rock-hard granite!</p><br/><p>Within the hole, there was not even a piece of rubble that was bigger than a fist! If one were to use their hands to pick it up, the rock pieces would immediately turn to powder and dissipate with the wind!</p><br/><p>In the surroundings of the hole, the place was neat and clean for a good few feet around it, without even a blade of grass present. The surface was neat and flat, as though a group of workers had dusted the place thoroughly. It was possible that even if they might not even be able to match this standard!</p><br/><p>The trees around the area were strangely devoid of leaves at the side facing the huge hole, forming an interesting sight with one side bare and the other bursting with lush leaves! Lines of white ash were present around the area, forming a scene as though a prehistoric animal had suddenly bared its fangs!</p><br/><p>In the area, dark red splashes could be seen intermittently for over a good hundred feet!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Her young noble was just far too rude.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat vile beast!\u201d Indeed, Chu Ting\u2019er flew into a rage, \u201cHe actually dares to be so rude! I will go and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d NanGong TianLong stood up, \u201cAh ah, don\u2019t be mad, madam. This old man was the one who is here to pay a visit to him and I should indeed go over to find him. I thank madam for informing him previously.\u201d NanGong TianLong knew that Ling Tian was flaunting his prestige in front of him. While he was extremely depressed in his heart, the present situation was much more critical. Thus, he still had a friendly smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Ah ah ah, Family Head NanGong is too polite. You are indeed magnanimous.\u201d Chu Ting\u2019er\u2019s face changed almost immediately, \u201cChun Tao, what are you waiting for? Quickly lead the way for Family Head NanGong! Tell that darn brat that Family Head NanGong is the esteemed guest of our Ling residence and he mustn\u2019t mistreat Family Head NanGong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing NanGong TianLong walk out with the maid, Chu Ting\u2019er let out a sigh of relief. Her face then broke out into a smile as she muttered, \u201cYou little b*st*rd, just see if I take care of you in the future! Hmph, you actually dared to keep me in the dark for so long! However, he is still much better than that wooden block father of his! This is what my son should be like!\u201d She then returned to her room with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had an amiable smile on his face with his slightly rosy cheeks and suave appearance. He looked completely harmless with a harmonious smile in his eyes. He then calmly sat there as he sized up the Family Head of one of the Eight Great Families, NanGong TianLong.</p><br/><p>NanGong TianLong had a squarish face, with a large nose and mouth and a face with a full beard. However, his eyes were brimming with energy with along with a well built and burly body. On the surface, he looked exactly like Yu ManTian, a straightforward and brash man who didn\u2019t know how to scheme. However, his calm-like-river eyes and profound gaze told Ling Tian that he would be a complete fool to treat NanGong TianLong like a brash individual!</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian was sizing NanGong TianLong up, NanGong TianLong was also doing the same. Was this frail-looking teen who looked like he would shy away from a conversation the number one silkpants in Sky Bearing? Was this the young noble of the Ling Family who recently revealed his frightening might and cruel means?! Just how many other unknown sides does this teen have?</p><br/><p>You really cannot judge a book by its cover! They both let out a sigh in their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must be tough for Family Head NanGong to come from afar. How can I trouble Family Head NanGong to visit me personally? Quick, be seated.\u201d Ling Tian stood up warmly and gave up his seat, \u201cChen\u2019er, serve some tea to let Family Head NanGong wash away his fatigue.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the room, Ling Chen acknowledged Ling Tian\u2019s words and walked out with a tea set.</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head is probably here for brother NanGong Le\u2019s affairs, right?\u201d Ling Tian took the initiative to start the conversation, letting out a long sigh as he continued with a solemn tone, \u201cWhile Ling Tian didn\u2019t have much interaction with brother NanGong Le, I greatly admired that straightforward manly vibe of his. For brother NanGong Le to come to Sky Bearing, I originally wanted to build a good relationship with him. Who would have imagined that the nightmare would befall so suddenly, and my brother was actually so brutally killed? For such a talent to fall, it is really the tragedy of the century! It really makes me extremely sad to hear about that. Ling Tian should be the one to visit you but I never expected Family Head to place such great importance on me and pay a personal visit. Ling Tian is really overwhelmed by the favor you show me.\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s words were obviously no different from nonsense. For NanGong Le to have a \u2018straightforward manly vibe\u2019, he probably only displayed that in the brothel. As for when Ling Tian said \u2018for a talent to fall, it is really the tragedy of the century\u2019, it was no different from complete nonsense! NanGong Le couldn\u2019t even be compared to a coward, so how could he be considered a hero?</p><br/><p>However, the effect of these words was still rather obvious, quickly closing the gap between the two. Especially after hearing someone mention the death of his son, NanGong TianLong revealed a painful expression, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Le\u2019er\u2019s death must be avenged! Our NanGong Family will never coexist with the Yang Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian responded with an \u2018oh\u2019 before asking, \u201cFrom what I have heard, the culprit who murdered brother NanGong Le had not been found up till today. How does Family Head NanGong know that the Yang Family was the culprit? Doesn\u2019t Family Head suspect that there is another party who is intentionally sowing discord between the two families to prevent your merger?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble Ling is an intelligent man. Why do you have to test me like that?\u201d NanGong TianLong let out a bitter laughter, \u201cAfter this incident, the Yang Family tried various means to cover it up and mystify the whole incident. But no matter what, they were unable to conceal the fact that the Yang Family was the culprit of that incident!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Ling Tian was truly puzzled. In truth, he also didn\u2019t know why NanGong TianLong was so certain that the Yang Family was the culprit. Was it just because of the statement from the guards? It can\u2019t be possible, right? How can a wily old fox like NanGong TianLong be duped so easily?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old man didn\u2019t believe that this was that old man Yang\u2019s plan,\u201d NanGong TianLong then said hatefully, \u201cbut he made one simple mistake. He shouldn\u2019t have tried to pull the Ling Family into the whole affair! Only after he tried to pull in the Ling Family was I certain that Yang KongQun was the one who killed my son! He tried to cover up too badly and revealed flaws on his own!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s doubt was no longer faked. He was completely confused by everything NanGong TianLong said. Just how did this old brat make such a judgment? While this young noble is usually extremely witty, I am getting more and more confused!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble\u2019s Ling Family has been fighting the Yang Family for over ten years and it wouldn\u2019t be too much to call both of your families mortal enemies, right?\u201d NanGong TianLong said while sipping his tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ah, I don\u2019t dare to call us mortal enemies. However, both our families serve the same imperial family and it is inevitable for us to have some conflicts.\u201d Ling Tian said calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble\u2019s martial arts is at an extremely high level and your wisdom far exceeds your peers. While you have been facing the world with a different appearance,\u201d NanGong TianLong paused for a moment before continuing calmly, \u201cit is completely acceptable for me to be unaware about your talents being thousands of miles away. However, this old man will never believe that Yang KongQun was completely unaware of this even after fighting your family for more than 10 years! Let me ask you a question: if the NanGong and Ling Family were to both be greatly injured from fighting each other, who would stand to gain the most from that?! It would definitely be the Yang Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ling Tian let out a long breath and finally understood the matter. So that was the case! He couldn\u2019t help but let out a smile as he added oil to the fire, \u201cthat\u2019s right, this young noble has fought with the Yang Family many times before and I have never been on the losing end. While this young noble is never willing to be unduly humble, if you were to say that Family Head Yang is unaware of my abilities with his wisdom, not to mention Family Head NanGong, even I won\u2019t be able to believe that.\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong TianLong slapped his thighs in agreement, \u201cThat\u2019s right! Yang KongQun obviously knew that you were the disciple of Beyond Heavens and had to conceal your talents because of the rules of your sect. However, he still chose to push the blame for Le\u2019er\u2019s death to the Ling Family! He obviously wants my NanGong Family to fight against your Ling Family and Beyond Heavens! He obviously wants to push my NanGong Family into complete destruction! Who wouldn\u2019t be able to see through the devious plans of his? To think that Yang KongQun still thought that his plan would succeed!\u201d NanGong TianLong said with disdain.</p><br/><p>*Cough cough cough* Ling Tian was drinking a mouth of his tea and couldn\u2019t help but choke on it. Disciple of Beyond Heavens? Just where did that come from?</p><br/><p>NanGong TianLong was certain that his conjectures were all extremely logical without any flaws to be picked at. He was certain that he had revealed all of Yang KongQun\u2019s devious plans. However, NanGong TianLong didn\u2019t know that the Yang Family was completely unaware of Ling Tian\u2019s strength before this! As for Ye QingChen, who represented Beyond Heavens, he only arrived at the Ling Family after NanGong Le\u2019s death. It was only due to Yang KongQun\u2019s bad luck that he offended Ye QingChen.</p><br/><p>As for Ling Tian being the disciple of Beyond Heavens, that was completely NanGong TianLong\u2019s imagination. In the whole continent, other than Beyond Heavens, who would be able to nurture someone like Ling Tian? Despite his young age, he was almost at the peak of martial arts! Thus, NanGong TianLong was not the only one with such thoughts. Many of the other powers also made such guesses!</p><br/><p>Even if Ling Tian were to openly announce that he wasn\u2019t the disciple of Beyond Heavens, no one would believe him for sure!</p><br/><p>When the NanGong Family came into Sky Bearing, they were completely overbearing in their actions and looked like their enmity with the Yang Family was completely irreconcilable! They didn\u2019t even give Yang KongQun a chance to give an explanation! Following that, all the other incidents happened one after another and Yu ManTian also coincidentally mixed into the mess. Through the many coincidences, the crime of NanGong Le\u2019s death was completely pinned onto the Yang Family!</p><br/><p>Even if Ling Tian were to announce that he was the one to kill NanGong Le, none of the powers would believe him for sure!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Ling Tian said with a sigh, \u201cif not for Family Head NanGong being farsighted and wise, Ling Tian would definitely end up being a scapegoat.\u201d Ling Tian shook his head with a mellow sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe innocent will remain innocent,\u201d NanGong TianLong said righteously, \u201ceven if things weren\u2019t so obvious, my NanGong Family surely wouldn\u2019t have maligned an innocent party.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

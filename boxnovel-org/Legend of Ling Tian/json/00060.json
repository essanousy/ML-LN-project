The moment the news of their return traveled to the anxiously waiting Old Madam Ling and Chu Ting\u2019er, they hurriedly made their way over. Seeing his bodyguards in a multitude of injuries, and furthermore missing a few of them, the two women could not help but gasp in shock.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian leaped out from the carriage, provoking Old Madam Ling and his mother Chu Ting\u2019er to reproach him for a period of time. Ling Tian merely laughed, signaling with his eyes before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go back to the room to talk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling and Chu Ting\u2019er were both experts in the art of picking up details, so how could they not catch his meaning? Thus they both agreed. Ling Tian also mentioned that he brought back a little girl and Chu Ting\u2019er did not fuss over it, asking some hands to help the girl get cleaned up. Seeing how Ling Tian meticulously took care of her, Chu Ting\u2019er felt her heart warm, and could not help but tease, \u201cTian\u2019er, why not I ask this little girl to be your maidservant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed in embarrassment, scratching his head. Seeing this, Chu Ting\u2019er could not help but laugh out as well, patting him on his head.</p><br/><p>Inside Old Madam Ling\u2019s chambers, Old Madam Ling listened with a heavy face to the ambush and attacks that Feng Mo recounted. On the side, Chu Ting\u2019er covered her mouth in shock. She immediately grabbed Ling Tian, drawing him into her embrace to scrutinize him, making sure he was not injured in any way. After she was convinced Ling Tian was unscathed, she announced that from today onward, Ling Tian was not allowed to move around alone. Unless it was a major issue, he was not allowed to step out of the Ling mansion.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ling Tian flew into a panic. He could not be bothered about the fact that Old Madam Ling was in deep thought, hugging her arm and shaking it back and forth. If his mother were to really set this rule, then he would have to imitate a noble family\u2019s only daughter, living a sheltered life as a caged pigeon. Ling Tian felt a rare sense of fear at that thought.</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling tenderly patted his head before speaking to Chu Ting\u2019er, \u201cTing\u2019er, it is not a good thing for a little boy to keep cooped at home. After all, you can\u2019t take care of him for his whole life and even an eaglet who grows up only being under the mother eagle will not be any good. Furthermore, I have already assigned experts to be near Ling Tian, he will be safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Chu Ting\u2019er still felt a twinge of heartache, she did not dare to rebut her mother-in-law, and thus could only agree in an aggrieved tone.</p><br/><p>Touching on the topic of the expert-level bodyguards, Ling Tian had his own thoughts as well, saying, \u201cGrandma, this time\u2019s incident really gave me a scare. After today, Tian\u2019er has found out that those by my side that can be deployed are truly few and between!\u201d</p><br/><p>This caused the old woman to burst into laughter, \u201cYou little rascal, do you even understand what fear means? Don\u2019t lie to me, you just took a liking to your father\u2019s Blood Iron Warriors, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could only let out an embarrassed smile as he replied: \u201cThey\u2019re really not bad. Very good, in fact!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Madam Ling not be able to guess his intentions? She merely laughingly scolded him, saying: \u201cGood good good, then I will have a word with your father tomorrow, Feng Mo\u2019s section will then stay with you and not return to their squads.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing such a thing, Ling Tian practically jumped for joy, exclaiming, \u201cThank you, grandma!\u201d He was overjoyed in his heart. With this few Blood Iron Warriors filling up his own lack of manpower, things would be able to proceed at a smoother pace. Furthermore, the best part about them was that their loyalty was definitely without question and that they were already used to the discipline of obeying in the army. Just this two points was what Ling Tian valued the most.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian subconsciously stretched out his fingers as he began to plan; first was the matter of the Violent Wind Gang, four Blood Iron Warriors could be sent there to ensure things stayed under control, secondly was the matter of King Fu\u2019s Courtyard. Someone had to be there to survey the scene as well. Thirdly would be the matter of recruiting more helpers, fourth would be the military workshop, the fifth would be\u2026 hahahaha, this time he had really struck the jackpot. Of all the problems buried in his heart, at least half were settled in this short while.</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling looked as though she had been completely exhausted of strength, lightly rubbing her temples.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Chu Ting\u2019er glanced at Ling Tian and said, \u201cIt is already late in the night, you should get some rest, mother. Tian\u2019er, you should also go to bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>This moment, Old Madam Ling\u2019s eyes gleamed as she calmly spoke: \u201cTing\u2019er, you have also been working for the whole day, you should go get a rest. As for Tian\u2019er, I would like to have a few words with him first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er expressed her agreement: \u201cYes mother.\u201d Ruffling Ling Tian\u2019s hair, she continued: \u201cListen to your grandma\u2019s words and don\u2019t be willful. Be good, Tian\u2019er!\u201d Before she left the room.</p><br/><p>In the room, the older and younger generation both sat there staring at each other, giving out weird smiles.</p><br/><p>Madam Ling suddenly opened her eyes wide, seeming as though her previous fatigue had all but disappeared. Obviously, it was all a farce she pulled off just now. Looking at Ling Tian, she spoke, \u201cSpeak. Why are you still hesitating?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian gave a bitter smile, thought about it, before deciding to reveal his all of his machinations.</p><br/><p>\u201cWHAT?!\u201d Madam Ling was so shocked that she shot straight up from her chair. \u201cDid you really ask for the armory that the Xiao Family is in charge of?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, that\u2019s right. I went to look for him to request for compensation, and he just handed that workshop over to me. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Ling Tian pretended to be naive and asked in doubt. Since there was no possibility of Xiao FengHan revealing what exactly happened, and Mister Qin who was riding on his trousers would all the more keep his lips zipped. Thus, Ling Tian was not afraid of spilling any secrets.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with that? There are many things wrong!\u201d Madam Ling was so agitated that she stood up from her chair. Pacing around the room, she continued, \u201cThis workshop is an important military base for the Xiao Family inside Sky Bearing Empire! According to the Ling Family\u2019s confidential reports, at least 5000 elite troops are hidden inside the workshop! With so many soldiers inside the heart of a country, what kind of imbalance can that cause? Even bringing down the capital would not be surprising! But now you\u2019re telling me that Xiao FengHan handed it over to you meekly? I\u2019m really beginning to wonder what sort of evil intentions he has by doing so!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled to himself, thinking, \u201cWell, he did not exactly meekly hand it over, I sort of forced him to do so. Under such conditions, he had no choice but to actually hand it over!\u201d However, even a kid knew what to say and what not to, let alone him. He only replied with, \u201cMaybe the Xiao Family Head saw that I was a genius, and decided to build a good relationship with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The originally severe expression of Madam Ling softened into one that was between crying and laughing, and stretched out a finger, pointing it at Ling Tian\u2019s head, saying, \u201cYou? Genius? If you were that good, then that old fellow would not bother to try to annul the marriage! This matter smells fishy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian scratched his head and smirked, \u201cNo matter what tactics he has, so long as grandma swaps all the manpower within the workshop, and pass the Xiao Family\u2019s troops over to Grandpa Ling, he will have no eyes and ears there anymore, let alone cause any waves!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling glared at him: \u201cThat\u2019s easy for you to say! If Xiao FengHan has any ulterior motives and decides to use this chance to drag our entire Ling Family inside, how would he allow letting his men be moved out? This matter might not be as simple as it seems.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Ling Tian gave a shifty smile as he said: \u201cIn this point, grandma need not worry; your grandson here has already gotten Family Head Xiao to agree that when he journeys home a few days later, he would bring whatever he deems important along with him. Thus, grandma just has to ensure that we find the necessary people to replace his people, and that will be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>This made Old Madam Ling even more at a loss. She could not make head or tails of what Xiao FengHan was scheming about. After 30 years of close relations, Madam Ling had a profound understanding of how her husband\u2019s sworn brother never failed to have deep plans and distant thoughts. Not only was his schemes extremely huge, his thoughts were also meticulous and could be said to be flawless in his calculations! Everything he did had a purpose, and would never allow himself to be at a disadvantage. However, the matter of him giving out his military workshop had no advantage whatsoever to the Xiao Family, and she could not help but think, \u201cDid Xiao FengHan have a change in his nature? Or is the great plan of the Xiao family coming to a halt?\u201d However, based on her observations the last few days, both did not really seem plausible.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, since there is no good reason, then might as well plan it step-by-step. Everything should be done cautiously. Hehe, now that the military workshop is in my hands, Xiao FengHan you can forget about carrying out any nefarious schemes or going back there! Both paths will be closed to you from now on!\u201d thought Old Madam Ling.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

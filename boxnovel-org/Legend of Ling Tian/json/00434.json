According to the culture of Ling Tian\u2019s present world, even a married couple would only see each other naked in the bedroom and no one would dare to be completely naked in front of others. The burly man felt his whole face flush red as he gasped in shock and quickly reacted to cover his key areas. However, he forgot about the sword that was in his hand and the sword pierced right into his own thigh. With the pain assaulting him, he let out another long roar towards the heavens\u2026 it was like the cry of a wolf on a full moon night, with his groan of defeat sounding far and wide\u2026</p><br/><p>What a long breath! Ling Tian praised in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, lass, open up your eyes and see his six packs! Who am I? The number one god of gambling! How would I lose to you?\u201d Ling Tian laughed heartily, \u201cSince when have you won any of our bets? Haha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was Ling Chen, Yu BingYan or any other ladies of this world, they would have probably turned their head around in embarrassment or covered their eyes with their hands. However, Li Xue wasn\u2019t an ordinary individual and instead looked at the burly man with amusement as she counted under her breath, \u201cTian\u2019ge! You have lost! It is obviously seven packs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? It can\u2019t be! How can it be seven packs?\u201d Ling Tian looked over doubtfully, \u201cIt is obviously six packs with three on each side. How can it be seven packs? Even if there are more, it should be considered eight packs!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue grunted for a while before raising her head up and saying proudly, \u201cBoth his hands are covering the final pack.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Ling Tian burst into laughter, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t count!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care, it is considered your loss.\u201d Li Xue began to act shamelessly before frowning with disgust, \u201cQuickly make him put on his clothes! How disgusting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed pretty disgusting! Even though he is full of muscles, he isn\u2019t the least bit attractive.\u201d Ling Tian agreed with a smile before shouting, \u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a shake of his right hand, the long pants sliced through the air with a swoosh and shot towards the burly man!</p><br/><p>That burly man was currently clenching his teeth and trying to pull the sword out of his thigh. However, his muscles were all tensed up and the sword that was embedded within his muscles was completely trapped! Blood flowed down along his thigh and the burly man bent down in pain with large beads of sweat rolling down his face!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the pair of pants that was imbued with Ling Tian\u2019s inner qi shot towards the burly man\u2019s neck. Without slowing down for a single bit, the burly man\u2019s head was sheared off neatly by the flying pair of pants! With Ling Tian\u2019s inner qi imbued within it, the pair of pants was as sharp as a blade and had cleanly decapitated the burly man!</p><br/><p>What a frightening inner qi cultivation! What a frightening method to kill someone!</p><br/><p>\u201cPu!\u201d A thick arrow of blood shot up towards the sky and rose a full twenty feet into the air! The strange scene in front of them made everyone feel a chill run down their spine as they shivered in fear!</p><br/><p>However, this was not the end yet. The burly man was still trying to pull out his sword and upon losing his head, the muscles of the burly man eased up and the bloody sword was suddenly pulled out cleanly. With the remaining force from pulling the sword out, the burly man\u2019s arms were both lifted up in the sky before he collapsed on the ground.</p><br/><p>The remaining dozens of burly men left behind were scared silly by the scene in front of them. They stood rooted to the ground trembling with cold sweat all over their backs and perspiration flowing down from their cheeks like a waterfall. The four burly men who had lost their calves forgot to groan in pain as they witnessed this scene unfolding before them. Their mouths were agape like a large hippopotamus and their muscles began to twitch\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMy goodness\u2026\u201d Li Xue patted herself on the chest gently and grumbled, \u201cAre you a pervert? Why did you have to kill him in such a gruesome manner? My hair is all standing up on edge and I will definitely have a nightmare tonight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood martial arts indeed! No wonder you are able to stir the Heavenly Star Continent up into chaos! Hearing the name \u2018Ling Tian\u2019 is like seeing a ghost!\u201d A crisp voice sounded with a trace of shock. While the words were fast, a brilliant sword light was even faster! The sword light descended from a tree by the side with the target being Ling Tian\u2019s chest!</p><br/><p>There was nothing special about this sword strike but it was unbelievably fast! Its speed could not even be described with words! Of all the martial arts in the world, only speed cannot be defeated! What a fast sword!</p><br/><p>After Ling Tian caught a glimpse of the sword, it was in front of his chest the next moment! The sword was lightning fast! This strike did not pursue looks or splendor but only had a single motive: to kill!</p><br/><p>A sword that was unleashed would not look back!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, not a single trace of killing intent could be detected on the sword! Or perhaps it would be accurate to say that the killing intent could not be felt in time! However, the aura of \u2018it\u2019s either your death or mine\u2019 suddenly exploded forth and filled the surroundings!</p><br/><p>It was a pity that Ling Tian wasn\u2019t someone ordinary!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt a trace of familiarity in his heart! In his memory, there were many others who could unleash such an attack: Ling Jian, Ling Chi, Ye BaiFei\u2026 and Ling Tian himself!</p><br/><p>An assassin! A top-notch assassin!</p><br/><p>How could Ling Tian deal with such a fast sword?!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s upper body remained motionless, but his feet made a criss-cross and he turned his body sideways. The life-severing strike then passed by Ling Tian\u2019s chest and a chilly aura brushed past Ling Tian\u2019s chest\u2026</p><br/><p>Life and death in an instant!</p><br/><p>Following that, a slim figure suddenly appeared by Ling Tian\u2019s side with a short dagger in his hand plunging towards Ling Tian\u2019s abdomen!</p><br/><p>From the trees on both sides, nine rays of sword light shot out towards nine different directions and descended from the skies like demons. At the same moment where the sword lights descended, the surrounding air seemed to have been sucked dry by the nine descending swords. While it was still noon with the sun shining brightly, the dozens of burly men by the side felt as though the space where Ling Tian was standing at had been enveloped with a black ball of haze, making it impossible to see what was happening within!</p><br/><p>At the same time, another six rays of sword light appeared and formed a dense sword net, covering Li Xue who was rushing to aid Ling Tian! They were actually ambushed at the same time! Ambushed by top-notch assassins at the same moment!</p><br/><p>The fifteen assassins who had appeared afterward were actually no weaker than the first assassin who ambushed Ling Tian! Each of them had their teeth clenched tight as they tried to exchange their lives with Ling Tian\u2019s!</p><br/><p>A full sixteen top-notch assassins were actually sent out for a single ambush mission! Such a lineup could fully display the determination to kill Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>As though his dagger had already plunged into Ling Tian\u2019s abdomen, the assassin burst out into a smile. But the next moment, the assassin felt as though his dagger plunged into thin air and he did not even hit anything. His dagger was launched when his body was right in front of Ling Tian and by the time the assassin realized that something was wrong, his figure had already passed by Ling Tian\u2019s side and it was too late to send out a second attack!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the assassin suddenly felt a sharp pain in his abdomen with his innards rupturing. A spurt of blood shot out from his mouth as he witnessed Ling Tian\u2019s knees returning to their original position!</p><br/><p>I was obviously the one attacking Ling Tian with him using all he had to avoid my attack! Why was I the one to get injured?!</p><br/><p>Why?!</p><br/><p>Right when the both of them brushed past each other, Ling Tian swiftly circulated his inner qi and sucked in his abdomen, forming a small crater to avoid the dagger. At the same time, he lifted up his knees and smashed the assassin\u2019s abdomen. By making use of the force generated from the assassin\u2019s speed, the might of his knee strike was doubled and the assassin\u2019s innards were completely destroyed!</p><br/><p>As for why the assassin\u2019s ambush turned into himself being attacked, that was no longer important. After the assassin charged forward for another fifty feet, he collapsed motionless on the ground and took his final breath. With his final willpower, he looked towards Ling Tian and saw Ling Tian brandishing a sword to receive the nine attacks launched towards him.</p><br/><p>The sword in his hands looks so familiar\u2026 that was originally my sword, and it was in my hands a moment ago\u2026 The assassin\u2019s consciousness came to the very end as his life dwindled away with his eyes wide open in shock and doubt\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone could clearly see that the assassin\u2019s hand was empty with his sword missing\u2026 Just when did Ling Tian take the assassin\u2019s sword?!</p><br/><p>Only speed cannot be defeated! To deal with a swift attack, one needs to be even faster!</p><br/><p>In this world, there wasn\u2019t the fastest, but only faster!</p><br/><p>A crisp phoenix\u2019s cry sounded, and Li Xue\u2019s slim figure began spinning on the spot. Her snow white palms struck out in all directions and after a few palm strikes, \u2018xiu xiu\u2019 sounds could be heard and the space around her seemed to have been frozen! As the chilly inner qi met the scorching daylight, a \u2018chi chi\u2019 sound could be heard and a white mist covered the whole battlefield!</p><br/><p>The Divine Ice Formula was activated fully!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

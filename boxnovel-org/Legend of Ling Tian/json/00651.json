Such hatred and enmity were irreconcilable! In a state of hatred, these originally pure and innocent girls were already clenching their teeth and thinking about how they could torture these beasts to vent their hatred!</p><br/><p>All the ladies took action together and did not bother about their shame any longer. They tied the burly men and HuangFu QingYun, a full 15 naked men, on the wooden poles. They used all the strength they had and wept as they tied those men up.</p><br/><p>While they were finally saved and could escape their cruel fates, their parents and loved ones had already been harmed and were no longer in the world. Their most precious chastity had also been ruined in the hands of these scums. Their lifetime of happiness had completely been ruined! Their inner hearts were already riddled with injuries!</p><br/><p>Even if they could take their revenge, where should they go from here?</p><br/><p>Even if they were still alive, what was the meaning of living on?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a long sigh. Witnessing the joy of these girls when they were saved and their quick transition to grief after venting their anger, Ling Tian felt his heart cramping up in pain! This was the ugly truth of society! Even if he was able to clean up one or two batches of these scums from the face of the earth, he would not be able to wipe them out completely!</p><br/><p>How many wealthy families were there in the world? How many rich second generation young masters were there? Among all of these people, as long as 0.1% of them were scums, it would be enough to bring endless suffering to the helpless commoners of the world!</p><br/><p>In the places where he was unable to reach and see, how many of such girls were suffering? How many commoner families had been broken up and destroyed without any place for them to voice their grievances?</p><br/><p>Just how should he change this cruel reality of society? Massacre them all? Be it his previous life or this, he had a deep hatred for such scums but he was also extremely helpless against them. There were just far too many scums in the world today! Even if he was able to wipe out a batch of them today, another batch of them would be born a short while later.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t be able to kill them all!</p><br/><p>The ugly nature of humans! No matter which generation they were in, such deplorable scums would definitely exist! This was true even in his previous life, not to mention this lawless society that he was currently in.</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Tian allowed these girls to take their revenge personally, hoping that they would be able to feel better after this and gain the courage to continue living on. But after seeing the zombie-like actions and absolute despair of these girls after taking their revenge, Ling Tian was certain that these girls would very likely seek their deaths after taking their revenge!</p><br/><p>Just what should he do?</p><br/><p>Even if he couldn\u2019t kill them all, he should still kill!</p><br/><p>Kill them with the most brutal and cruel methods!</p><br/><p>Unless I cannot find them, the moment I find them, I will definitely uproot them completely! Such people do not deserve to be called humans! They do not deserve the right to enjoy anything on this earth and do not have the right to leave behind a future generation! They should be destroyed completely! This is the right way!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian made a resolution in his heart. As long as he saw scums like these, he would kill one if he saw one, kill two if he saw two and kill a thousand if he saw a thousand! If the entire world was filled with scums like these, then he would just have to wipe out the entire human race!</p><br/><p>Even if he became the public enemy of the world, he must live up to his conscience!</p><br/><p>Treating violence with violence! Let the heavens watch as I kill all the way to the end!</p><br/><p>A commotion could be heard from afar and a few miserable groans could be heard mixed within the commotion. Feeling a wave of heat coming from above, Ling Tian\u2019s figure flashed and he appeared at the entrance of the underground tunnel. A black shadow then appeared in front of him; Ling Jian had arrived!</p><br/><p>\u201cReporting to young noble, the HuangFu Family is already in our complete control. Including HuangFu YanHan, not a single one of them managed to escape. Can I ask young noble how we should deal with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are the casualties of our brothers like?\u201d Ling Tian asked with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201c216 of our brothers died in battle, 40 severely injured and more than 300 with light injuries. Nineteen is injured and Ling Four has light injuries. The rest are all fine.\u201d Ling Jian replied succinctly.</p><br/><p>\u201cA mere HuangFu Family caused us to lose that many men!\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s appearance was calm and he let out a sigh. His tone then became strict as he ordered, \u201cGather all of the HuangFu Family captives over here and bring the hostages that we kidnapped here as well! Today, I want to let the HuangFu Family members witness their family members get executed by being sliced into ten thousand pieces! Not a single one of them shall be let off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was startled by Ling Tian\u2019s never seen before cruelty but quickly regained his cool. An excited appearance could be seen on his face as he bowed respectfully and began issuing the orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing One!\u201d Ling Tian roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate is here!\u201d Ling One appeared with blood all over his body. His gaze was fixed on Ling Tian as he awaited his orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cSend some men over and carry all the men tied to the wooden poles in the secret chamber out! Take out all the remaining wooden poles and bury them here! When the members of the HuangFu Family are brought over, tie them all up onto the poles!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling One acknowledged the orders and waved his hands for his subordinates to carry them out. Ling Tian then added, \u201cThere are more than a hundred girls who had been abused in the secret chamber. Do not scare them and invite them out carefully. Send some food and clean water over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling One was stunned for a moment before acknowledging his orders respectfully. He immediately understood why his young noble was so furious. As an old subordinate who had followed Ling Tian for a long time, he naturally understood what Ling Tian hated the most. It seems like the HuangFu Family had truly crossed Ling Tian\u2019s bottom line and their only outcome would be for their family to be completely wiped out!</p><br/><p>A short while later, all the wooden poles of the HuangFu Family were erected up in the west courtyard. On every wooden pole, a naked body filled with fear would be trembling on the wooden pole.</p><br/><p>The few hundred girls were invited out and Ling Tian had made special arrangements for them to sit down and watch the ending of their enemies. However, these girls who were so full of hatred did not even want to sit down and had flames in their eyes. They glared fiercely at the masterminds who were on the wooden poles with a cruel glow in their eyes. There were even some who could not conceal how much they were looking forward to those beasts dying a cruel death.</p><br/><p>Despite clean water and food being sent to them, these girls did not touch the food or water at all. Despite them being both fatigued and hungry, they would rather starve to death and witness the retribution of their enemies first!</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian looked at the hatred in the eyes of these ladies, he suddenly had an idea.</p><br/><p>A clattering sound could be heard and HuangFu YanHan was brought over together with the other captives of the HuangFu Family. Their bodies were all filled with blood and looks of despair could be seen on their faces.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at HuangFu YanHan with disgust on his face and ordered, \u201cTie them all on the wooden poles!\u201d A few burly men acknowledged the order and quickly tied the captives of the HuangFu Family up onto the poles as though they were dumplings.</p><br/><p>As the subordinates of the Sky Alliance saw the girls who had obviously been tortured badly, they all understood what the HuangFu Family had done. All of them were completely enraged at the outrageous actions of the HuangFu Family and hated the fact that they could not dice these scums up on the spot. Thus, they naturally wouldn\u2019t be the slightest bit polite to those from the HuangFu Family.</p><br/><p>The sound of galloping horses could be heard and the other members from the HuangFu Family who were previously hostages had also arrived. The first young noble of the HuangFu Family, HuangFu Jun, was naturally included. The moment HuangFu Jun witnessed the scene in front of him, his body immediately turned soft. The final strand of hope that his family would save him was completely extinguished. All the upper echelons of the HuangFu Family were present today and not a single one of them were missing! The rescue mission that he was looking forward to was no more than a joke from beginning to the end!</p><br/><p>Glaring at the more than 200 wooden poles in the courtyard, Ling Tian bellowed with a cold voice, \u201cI am going to ask all of you a few questions. Where did you sell all of the girls that you captured over the past years? Who did you hand them over to? Who were your accomplices? Where are they now? What other powers participated in it? You better spill the beans without leaving anything out!\u201d</p><br/><p>HuangFu QingYun who was on the wooden pole opened his eyes as though he saw a ray of hope and asked, \u201cIf I come clean, will you give me a road to survive?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled cruelly and said, \u201cRoad to survive? Alright, as long as you come clean, I will pardon your life! I definitely won\u2019t go back on my words!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d HuangFu QingYun immediately relaxed and was elated.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also know, let me speak first\u2026\u201d A few others immediately began fighting for the chance to speak. With the hope to survive in front of their eyes, none of them could be bothered about any rank hierarchy and began arguing.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k all of your ancestors! Stop clamoring! Talk one by one! Whoever makes any more noise would be crippled by me first!\u201d Ling Tian roared and said in a sinister tone, \u201cAll of you listen up, if any of you can point out any falsehood in his words, I will give you a path to survive. Remember, only one of you will be allowed to speak and only one of you can be allowed to live! I hope that all of you will treasure this chance!\u201d</p><br/><p>HuangFu QingYun was overjoyed and he said anxiously, \u201cLet me speak, let me speak. All of the messages went through me. Rest assured Sir, I will definitely tell you everything that I know and will not miss out a single detail.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the other members from the HuangFu Family glared at HuangFu QingYun viciously as they prayed that this fellow would miss a few details or get some of his facts wrong so that they would have a chance to survive.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian waved his hands to instruct his subordinates to record down the details.</p><br/><p>Following HuangFu QingYun\u2019s confession, countless incidents of kidnapping and human trafficking were exposed. The sheer amount of powers that these incidents were related to and the size of the whole operation was absolutely shocking!</p><br/><p>Without mentioning the other powers, just the HuangFu Family alone had made no less than 70,000,000 taels of silver! The number of poor girls who they had kidnapped and sold was tens of thousands!</p><br/><p>When they heard about these figures, even Ling One and the others who had stayed in Heavenly Wind for a couple of years was completely dumbfounded! The actions of these individuals were truly demented and deranged!</p><br/><p>HuangFu QingYun spoke until he was thirsty before finally being able to recount the full story. However, his brows remained furrowed, afraid that he might have missed any detail out and let someone snatch his final chance to survive. However, the words that he had said shocked everyone present to the extreme! They all cursed him in their hearts with anger. He truly wasn\u2019t human! He was no different from a beast!</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes anybody have anything to add on?\u201d After a moment of silence, Ling Tian suppressed the killing intent in his heart and asked with a cold tone.</p><br/><p>The captives who were tied on the wooden poles had their brows furrowed in deep thought as they searched for a chance to survive. They had to admit that while HuangFu QingYun was a scum, he was a scum who was extremely intelligent!</p><br/><p>Turning around, Ling Tian looked at Ling One and asked, \u201cDid you record everything that this b*st*rd said?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling One hurriedly replied, \u201cRest assured young noble, I have recorded it all down without missing anything out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian snorted and ordered, \u201cAccording to the list which you just made, as long as any family is on the list, execute their whole family and sentence them to death by slicing them up into a thousand pieces! Your Sky Alliance will be in charge of all the organizations in Heavenly Star and you are not allowed to miss a single one out! Those in Heavenly Star shall be left to Ling Chen to handle. Immediately send a pigeon to her and you must uproot them all by the roots! Regardless of whether they are young or old, man or woman, not a single one must be left behind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Ling One replied solemnly, \u201cI will carry out your orders now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm.\u201d Ling Tian waved his hands before turning around to look at the members of the HuangFu Family. After waiting for a moment and realizing that no one had anything else to add, he said, \u201cSince no one wants to add anything on, we shall begin the execution! We shall start with those who have been captured from the underground chamber. Execute them by slicing them into a thousand pieces! Before the nine hundred and ninety-ninth cut, not a single one shall be allowed to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pin-drop silence!</p><br/><p>No one would have expected Ling Tian to sentence them to the cruelest form of execution!</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan felt his body trembling as his face cramped up and roared, \u201cAren\u2019t you guys too vicious! Isn\u2019t killing us an extremely simple matter? My HuangFu Family will admit our defeat today and if you guys are men, give us a quick death! Can you guys be considered heroes to torture your captured enemies with such extreme methods?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian watched HuangFu YanHan with a cold gaze as he retorted, \u201cHuangFu YanHan, even a beast like you dares to talk to me about being a hero? A martial arts family like yours only knows how to use your strength to oppress the weak commoners and gain benefits from their pride and bodies. You still dare to talk to me about being a hero? Scumbag!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the actions of your HuangFu Family, even executing you guys by slicing all of you up into a thousand pieces is letting you off too easy. You still want to die a quick death? How can there be something so good? I want you to personally watch all of your children suffer a cruel execution so that you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell which pile of meat is your children or wife when you are in the underworld! I want to dig up the graves of all your ancestors and use dog\u2019s blood and human pee to soak the ashes of your ancestors! I will ensure that they cannot lift their heads up even as a ghost! For them to give birth to a bunch of b*st*rds like all of you, they deserve to suffer from such a punishment! Their crimes are unpardonable!\u201d</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan spat out a mouthful of blood in anger, \u201cYou\u2026 you are truly vicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVicious?\u201d Ling Tian glared hatefully at HuangFu YanHan, \u201cYou guys caused the destruction of tens of thousands of families and you actually said that I am vicious? I still think that I am not vicious enough! Men! Carry out the execution!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d HuangFu YanHan coughed weakly and he looked at Ling Tian with a venomous glare, \u201cTell me your name. I, HuangFu YanHan, admit my death today and will accept anything that you throw at me. However, I wish to die a knowing death and want to know who you are!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis young noble has always been merciful when treating someone who is about to die. I will definitely fulfill this wish of yours.\u201d Ling Tian walked over to HuangFu YanHan slowly. He then swiftly dislocated HuangFu YanHan\u2019s jaw before sealing HuangFu YanHan\u2019s cultivation, \u201cThis young noble is Ling Tian! Ling Tian from Heavenly Star\u2019s Sky Bearing. The men from the Sky Alliance are all my men! Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Despair could finally be seen in HuangFu YanHan\u2019s eyes. He originally wanted to drag for time and gather the last bit of his strength to bite his tongue or destroy his meridians to commit suicide. He originally intended to commit suicide immediately after hearing the name of his enemy. However, he never expected Ling Tian to see through his thoughts and he no longer had the strength to even commit suicide. He can only wait and watch his family members endure the cruelest execution in the world!</p><br/><p>\u201cBegin!\u201d Ling Tian waved his hands. \u201cTwenty people shall form a group and you guys should not carry out the execution too quickly. Take your own sweet time so that they can favor this memory of theirs and enjoy it to their heart\u2019s content!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Twenty men stepped out with their blades. These twenty men had experienced countless slaughter on the battlefield and would naturally not have any hesitation or pity for the members of the HuangFu Family. Ling Jian watched from the side with his eyes narrowed and took on the role of commander for the execution.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about me? Young noble, sir, my dear ancestor, you promised to leave me my life. You are a hero and will definitely keep your word!\u201d HuangFu QingYun began crying out and struggled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, since I made a promise, I won\u2019t go back on it. Since I said that you wouldn\u2019t die, you definitely won\u2019t die!\u201d Ling Tian said with a bright smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 thank you young noble for sparing my life, I will definitely not forget it in this lifetime of mine.\u201d HuangFu QingYun heaved a sigh of relief. Staying alive was his biggest wish at the moment.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian glanced at HuangFu QingYun with a devious smile on his face. This daddy here will immediately make you regret not choosing the option of being executed. Ling Tian then roared, \u201cMen, put him down and no one is allowed to kill him! I am definitely a man of my word!\u201d</p><br/><p>HuangFu QingYun was overjoyed and thanked Ling Tian profusely.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then added on, \u201cI promised to spare your life and will definitely keep my word\u2026\u201d As Ling Tian said those words, Ling Jian and the others had a strange look on their faces and the hundreds of girls were full of disappointment. HuangFu QingYun was naturally overjoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMen, pull out his eyes, pierce his eardrums, cut off his nose, pull out his tongue, break all of his teeth, castrate him, cut his tendons, smash his backbone, and break all of his ribs,\u201d Ling Tian said in a single breath. \u201cThat will be all. After doing all of those things, allow him to lead a life on the outside. This young noble will definitely keep my word. Since I said that I would spare his life, I would definitely make sure he can leave this place alive. Remember to be gentle with your actions and do not harm his life. After all of the above tasks are completed, he must still be alive. Do all of you understand?!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

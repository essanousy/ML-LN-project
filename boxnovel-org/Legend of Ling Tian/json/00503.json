The moment she crawled out from the bed, she thought about what Ling Tian did to her last night and began stomping her feet angrily. This darn Ling Tian, he actually dared to seal this Miss\u2019s acupoints! Unforgivable! Even if my uncle can hold his anger back in, my aunt will not be able to do so. Even if my aunt can hold her anger in, I cannot hold my anger back in!</p><br/><p>She then lifted the folds of the tent up fiercely and wanted to seek revenge on Ling Tian. However, she suddenly felt a light flashing before her eyes and as she squinted her eyes to take a look, she saw a long sword sticking out from a pile of rocks reflecting the sunlight into her eyes! Looking at this sword, Xiao YanXue suddenly felt a sense of familiarity and could not help but gasp, \u201cHeaven Splitter?!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the sword which was snatched from her hands in the auction! How could Xiao YanXue not remember it? Seeing the appearance of the sword again, Xiao YanXue suddenly recalled the scene of the unparalleled expert snatching the Heaven Splitter away from the experts of the various families and could not help but associate that unparalleled expert with the number one expert in the world, Justice. If Justice was truly the owner of the Heaven Splitter, then\u2026 Xiao YanXue realized that if Justice had truly arrived, wouldn\u2019t it mean that Ling Tian\u2019s life was in danger?</p><br/><p>How was Ling Tian right now? Could something have happened to him?</p><br/><p>Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue instantly sprinted over madly as tears filled her eyes! While she did not know how powerful Justice was, she could clearly remember the strength of the unparalleled expert who stole the Heaven Splitter! Regardless of whether or not he was the legendary Justice, Ling Tian would definitely not have the slightest bit of chance if that person were to attack Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>With her heart in a complete mess, Xiao YanXue actually did not realize that there was a seemingly solid but yet translucent green figure near the Heaven Splitter.</p><br/><p>After taking four to five steps, Xiao YanXue found Ling Tian lying on the ground silently with bloodstains all over his body\u2026 His figure was motionless, and his breath could not even be detected\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue let out a world-shaking shriek and suddenly felt as though her soul was being shattered into pieces. The world around her began spinning as she felt her head turn light and her sight blacking out. It was as though there wasn\u2019t the slightest bit of hope left in the world and life turned completely meaningless. Her mind was filled with thoughts but yet also completely void of any thoughts. There were only a few words resounding in her head over and over again: he\u2019s dead\u2026 he\u2019s dead\u2026 he\u2019s dead\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue stumbled her way towards Ling Tian and the short few meters in front of her suddenly felt so endless and unrealistic. Finally, Xiao YanXue let out a heart-wrenching cry and felt her sight blacking out before collapsing on the ground.</p><br/><p>Justice, who was alerted by Xiao YanXue\u2019s scream, shot forward and held onto Xiao YanXue before she collapsed, placing her body lightly onto the ground. Xiao YanXue\u2019s face was completely pale, and she had already fainted from grief with a trace of bright red blood trickling down from her lips. With his knowledge, Justice could naturally tell that the trace of blood trickling down Xiao YanXue\u2019s lips was a result of extreme shock and agitation. Who would have thought that the little princess of the Xiao Family would be so deeply in love with Ling Tian?!</p><br/><p>Justice could not help but let out a sigh. Xiao YanXue was only scaring herself and as for he who was supposed to kill Ling Tian, not only did he bring an item to help Ling Tian escape from certain death, he even stood guard by Ling Tian\u2019s side. With Justice standing guard by Ling Tian\u2019s side, there was nothing in the world capable of threatening Ling Tian! This level of protection was just far too high!</p><br/><p>Looking at the still unconscious Ling Tian, Justice could not help but let out a gratified smile. Not only did this brat in front of him have a heaven-shaking intellect, his martial arts were near the peak of the world and even his luck with women was amazing. However, Ling Tian would probably be tangled with endless love problems in this life of his for sure and an ordinary person would probably not be able to enjoy such a luxury.</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Justice could not help but be startled. Ordinary person? Could it be that he had already admitted that Ling Tian wasn\u2019t someone ordinary in his heart? Thinking about all of the things which happened on Ling Tian, Justice could not help but let out a sigh and close his eyes. Even if he didn\u2019t want to admit it, this brat in front of him was just far too extraordinary.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the unconscious Ling Tian suddenly muttered, \u201cCome if you want and leave if you want.\u201d His voice was calm and the words clearly sounded! At the same time, it was filled with endless longing and a dense\u2026 tenderness with a tinge of sorrow accompanying it.</p><br/><p>This was a phrase that carried with it a deep meaning!</p><br/><p>As Justice turned around to look at Ling Tian, he realized that Ling Tian was still unconscious and motionless. An odd look could be seen in his eyes as he pondered about the meaning behind those words. Why would Ling Tian spit out such words despite being unconscious? While the phrase was short, simple and seemed extremely ordinary, just what was the meaning of Ling Tian saying those words right after he met with such a miraculous event? Justice could not help but let his imagination roam.</p><br/><p>Could it be that Ling Tian had dreamed about heavenly secrets? Thinking about that, Justice suddenly felt as though the words that Ling Tian had just said were filled with the truth of the heavenly laws. That\u2019s right, come when it is the right time to come and leave when it is the right time to leave. However, just what was the right time? Justice frowned as he fell into deep thought.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian, who was still unconscious, felt as though his body was extremely light as though he was a feather. At the same time, he seemed to be walking on a dense seven-colored cloud, walking on a narrow glowing pathway walking towards an unknown destination. He could not help but let out a bitter laugh of self-mockery as he thought about how he was once again on the \u2018familiar\u2019 but yet \u2018foreign\u2019 Yellow Springs road.</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, he felt a tremor in his head and heard a heart-wrenching cry, \u201cLING TIAN!\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s heart shook and he turned back immediately only to see a beautiful lady sprinting towards him clumsily with tears all over her face. Despite her sprinting over with all of her strength, she seemed to be getting farther and farther away and it was just impossible to close the gap! This beautiful lady was Xiao YanXue!</p><br/><p>Witnessing Xiao YanXue collapse onto the ground in despair and her voice fading away gradually, Ling Tian felt his heart ache and was about to shout out. However, the scene in front of him transformed completely with a blur and a gentle voice called out to him, \u201cYoung noble.\u201d He then saw Ling Chen\u2019s resolute yet gentle appearance drifting towards him slowly. After that, Yu BingYan and Li Xue appeared behind her and looked at him silently with gentleness in their eyes. While they did not say a single word, their willingness to die with him could be clearly seen in their eyes. They were filled with resolution and had no complaints or regrets!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a smile and suppressed the sorrow in his heart. At this moment, anything he said was meaningless. Thus, Ling Tian waved his hands helplessly and said dimly, \u201cCome if you want and leave if you want.\u201d The four ladies immediately burst out in satisfied and surprised smiles as they gathered closer to Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt his heart ache and felt an empty feeling in his heart. However, at this moment an unspeakable happiness and satisfaction undeniably flooded his heart.</p><br/><p>How would the unconscious Ling Tian be able to know that the parting words he said to his loved ones would be treated as the mysterious truth of the heavenly laws by Justice?</p><br/><p>If we are able to meet in our next life, I will definitely not let all of you down! Ling Tian made a vow in his heart before turning around and continuing walking down the path in front of him.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, an indescribable pain assaulted Ling Tian\u2019s consciousness and even with Ling Tian\u2019s stunning will, he was actually unable to bear with the pain! At this moment, it was as though his body and soul were being sliced apart piece by piece with countless types of torture equipment being used on them. Ling Tian\u2019s brows were furrowed as he clenched his teeth and let out soft groans. All of a sudden, darkness filled his vision, and both the rainbow-colored clouds as well as the glowing road disappeared. The only thing left was the endless pain assaulting his body and soul.</p><br/><p>Letting out a painful groan, Ling Tian slowly opened his eyes and felt as though his whole body was on fire. His innards felt as though they were burning in the flames of hell and even his soul was convulsing and churning. This intense pain, that was capable of destroying the will of any individual, poured into Ling Tian\u2019s consciousness! While the degree of his injuries was within his expectations, when Ling Tian used his internal vision to view the condition of his body, he clicked his tongue in shock. It was truly severe to the extreme!</p><br/><p>His meridians were just short of exploding completely. If his meridians were to be completely destroyed, his whole body would be rendered immobile and he would be no different from a cripple!</p><br/><p>The most frustrating thing was the fact that up until now, Ling Tian still didn\u2019t know what the cause of this tribulation was! He was completely clueless and still unable to make heads or tails of what had happened. However, he almost lost his life due to his ignorance. Ling Tian let out a self-mocking smile as he thought, Entering into cultivation deviation without even knowing the reason behind it, I am probably the first in the world right\u2026 isn\u2019t my luck just too\u2026 good? Or am I just too unlucky! To think that I would meet with something like this with my dogsh*t luck!</p><br/><p>Looking at his current physical appearance, a wave of helplessness overwhelmed Ling Tian again. He was stark naked without a single piece of clothes on his body as though he was a newly born infant. At the same time, his whole body was covered with bloodstains and there were at least a hundred scars on his body! Apart from his face which he had controlled despite the intense pain, there was not a single part of his body intact from his neck down.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a bitter laugh and tried moving his body but immediately felt a bone-piercing pain. Taking in a breath of cold air, Ling Tian realized that all of the blood that had flowed out of his body had already dried up on the rocky ground and stuck his damaged body to the ground. The moment he moved, he felt as though he was being skinned alive!</p><br/><p>While his body could not move, Ling Tian knew that he was absolutely safe. As long as nothing happened to his horrifying internals, then he would definitely not face any danger. Before he went unconscious, Ling Tian could clearly see Justice looking at him as though he was a treasure. With Justice around, even if he was surrounded by a million soldiers, he would definitely be alright.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

And there was even a frighteningly powerful First Pavilion behind him. While he wouldn\u2019t be afraid of an all-out attack from the First Pavilion, what about his subordinates? His disciples?!</p><br/><p>Thus, Yu ManLou calculated that if the black-robed man took on a softer stance, he would allow him to leave. Right now, the Yu Family had enemies akin to the number of leaves on a tree and could do with one less enemy, especially such a powerful one!</p><br/><p>Things ran contrary to his thoughts however, as obviously the Pavilion Head was not interested at all in his proposal! Since that was the case then there was no common ground between them! If they couldn\u2019t be friends then they could only be enemies. For an ally, the stronger the better, but against an enemy, the stronger the enemy, the earlier it had to be eradicated! One couldn\u2019t be soft-hearted, as this would only leave a cancerous situation! While the First Pavilion was strong, it wasn\u2019t considered significant in the eyes of the Yu Family. It was just that in these troubled times, one enemy less is one trouble less, especially considering such a frightening assassination group. Since they didn\u2019t cooperate though, then there was no need to hesitate!</p><br/><p>The black-robed man had to be killed!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou slowly raised his right hand, his face filled with killing intent as he coldly spoke, \u201cSince Pavilion Head refuses to work with me, this old me would like to see if the First Pavilion can still hold its title after losing its Pavilion Head!</p><br/><p>As his hand dropped, a cold voice barked out the order, \u201cLight it up! Force him to show himself! Kill!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, it still escalated to this step! Ling Jian\u2019s heart jolted. While he treated his life and death with contempt, when it really came to this juncture, he still felt some lingering fear!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou actually didn\u2019t give him even a bit of chance, how decisive, how ruthless!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face was plastered on the cold and hard earth. His mental state had once again regained tranquility much like a calm lake as all his memories flashed through his mind continuously, from young to old. Outside, heap after heap of firewood was continuously thrown in, not leaving a single place uncovered, and began to blaze up in flames. The fire shot up high towards the sky, lighting up the surrounding area as though it was daytime!</p><br/><p>The blaze was quickly approaching where Ling Jian was hidden, and while Ling Jian had protected his body completely with his own internal energy, it was to no avail. The raging flames seemed to have sucked out every single bit of fresh air from the garden, and being in the core of the inferno, Ling Jian already began to feel a little suffocated. His clothes were already smoking, and his hair shriveling, curling up into wisps.</p><br/><p>Was it going to end like this?</p><br/><p>Ling Jian viciously buried his head down, breathing in the damp and moist air inside the soil. Suddenly, his head sprang out, chilling killing intent shooting out from his eyes. The brightness in his eyes seemed to make even the raging inferno dull in comparison!</p><br/><p>Since that\u2019s the case, then I might as well stake it all, and get rid of some strong enemies for young noble!</p><br/><p>Even if I am to die, my death has to be worth it!</p><br/><p>Within the blaze, a long and intense shout shattered the silence!</p><br/><p>The people within the surroundings, including Yu ManLou, all jumped out in fright!</p><br/><p>Within the shout, one could hear an unresigned will, as though the person was unable to let go of his worldly matters. It sounded like the desolate mourning of a hero upon meeting an undesired end. Also present was a killing intent that shot towards the sky, a violent and tyrannical battle intent, and a resolve to destroy everything and to die without regrets! Everyone present understood that this Pavilion Head had already reached a point of ignoring life and death itself!</p><br/><p>The top assassin of a generation indeed carried a peerless demeanor unimaginable by the ignorant masses! No matter how the battle ended today, this assassin would still be crowned as a king. Just based on the strength behind his shout, he was already worthy of the respect of all martial artists!</p><br/><p>The pupils of all the people in the Yu Family present shrank!</p><br/><p>A cornered beast is the most dangerous, so how would anyone dare to have contempt for it?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he was an assassin among assassins whose name had shaken the world. Was he finally going to counterattack because he was in danger?</p><br/><p>To want to eliminate this grim reaper without paying even a small price, that was no doubt a huge fantasy! This First Pavilion Head would die today no matter what, but under the circumstances where he knew his impending death, how many people would he drag down to hell with him?</p><br/><p>For Yu ManLou, he might be confident of killing this black-robed man, but he probably wouldn\u2019t be able to escape the person\u2019s final terrifying counterattack!</p><br/><p>Everyone had heavy hearts as they trained their eyes on the inferno. Their expressions were grave as they prepared for the arrival of their enemy!</p><br/><p>Pieces of firewood repeatedly flew out from the fire, carrying with them the raging heat from the inferno, scattering in all directions. In the darkness of the night, it resembled a dragon soaring unrestrainedly within the skies, swallowing all and desiring to set the world on fire!</p><br/><p>Everybody involuntarily took a step back! Everyone secretly prayed that that grim reaper wouldn\u2019t approach their direction first!</p><br/><p>A fatal killing intent followed close!</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone be careful!\u201d A loud shout came from an old bearded man. Even as he shouted, his men around him had also thrust out the weapons in their hands.</p><br/><p>A lump of firewood, carrying with it a raging blaze, had flown out in front of a White Jade expert of the Yu Family. That expert brandished his sword, flinging the blazing firewood off to the side, but beneath it, a glaring sword light suddenly flashed past him. That became the final sight in his entire life! With a \u2018sou\u2019 sound, the sword tip pierced deep into his chest and was pulled back out in a split second. \u2018Shua shua\u2019, another two moves were seen, and the people beside him followed suit, crumpling down on the ground.</p><br/><p>The blazing firewood suddenly changed direction, throwing itself towards the white-bearded old man. That old man had a wealth of experience, and even after seeing three White Jade Experts fall on the ground, his mental state was still unflustered. Seeing the blaze hurtle towards him, it was something he actually wanted instead. The old man\u2019s sword danced, as though capable of shielding him from all rain and wind, covering his entire body. So long as he could block the first strike from the black-robed man, he would be surrounded by his allies and wouldn\u2019t be in danger anymore. The black-robed man\u2019s martial arts might be frighteningly strong, but he still wouldn\u2019t be able to kill him when besieged from all sides! The old man\u2019s sword arts were indeed fine and meticulous, scattering all the stray clumps of fire. However, the attack that he anticipated didn\u2019t come in the end!</p><br/><p>Just as he was fully engrossed in dealing with the blaze around him, a faint shadow had flashed past him in that instant, and another few fiery dragons were shot out, heading towards different directions. Agonized screams sounded one after another, and yet a few more White Jade Experts had fallen under Ling Jian\u2019s sword!</p><br/><p>This was really one strike, one kill. There was no one fortunate enough to still be alive!</p><br/><p>A muffled sound was heard, and Ling Jian staggered. An expert had taken the chance to sneak a palm strike on him, and following the impact, Ling Jian\u2019s body flew out, tumbling into a crouch. Following a few more screams, six hairy legs left their owners\u2019 bodies forever, flying up.</p><br/><p>Even as the streams of blood spurted out, that secretive shadow had once again vanished from the light.</p><br/><p>The Head of First Pavilion, the number one assassin in the world, Sword of Ling Tian! He had begun his killing spree in the Yu Family!</p><br/><p>Daunting and vigorous, killing like a crazed devil!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou only coldly looked towards the ephemeral shadow as he hollered, \u201cKill him at all costs!\u201d</p><br/><p>Along with the agreement of over a few thousand shouts, everyone rushed up to surround the area!</p><br/><p>Just how many people would end up being buried with this peerless expert?</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian frowned, as he sized up Li Xue who was fully dressed up in nightwalking clothes. Not knowing whether to laugh or cry, he said, \u201cI say, Miss Li, even if we were blood-related, there\u2019s no need to share a room together, right? Doesn\u2019t Senior have a room to yourself? Why run over to my side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHng!\u201d Li Xue snorted in a cute way, before replying unhappily, \u201cDon\u2019t think I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re actually up to! You are definitely planning to go out tonight and find something fun to do, don\u2019t lie to me! I tell you, Ling Tian, I understand you more than you yourself ever would! Trying to peel off this lady so you can roam by yourself, dream on! Wait\u2026 what Senior?! Do I look old?! What\u2019s the meaning of this, explain yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was struck speechless, \u201cHow would you be old? Even when I reach my seventies and eighties, you will still be an attractive lady of middle age, with grace and elegance\u2026\u201d The more he spoke, the more he realized Li Xue\u2019s face was turning uglier, and he immediately diverted her attention. \u201cLet me ask you, from what did you conclude that I was going out tonight? Didn\u2019t you see me half naked when you came in? I don\u2019t have the habit of streaking around!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Tian ridiculing her at the start, Li Xue was about to explode in anger, but he suddenly changed his topic, making her fire fizz out and leaving her in a gloomy mood. She only snorted again, suddenly rushing forward and grabbing onto a cloth bag which Ling Tian had placed by his bedside. She delightedly waved it around as she spoke, \u201cNot going out? Then what are these for?\u201d As she spoke, she untied the knot, clicking her tongue as she continued, \u201cWow, so prepared, there\u2019s clothes, mask, appearance changing powder, flying aspara claws\u2026 Tian\u2019ge, don\u2019t tell me, you need all these things in order to sleep at night, hahahaha\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sighing in defeat, Ling Tian could only resignedly nod his head, \u201cOkay, okay, I admit defeat. So long as you tell me how you found out that I was going out tonight, then I\u2019ll bring you along.\u201d Ling Tian couldn\u2019t fathom just how Li Xue managed to get one up on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe.\u201d Li Xue smiled, her eyes turning into crescents, \u201cTian\u2019ge, this is Bright Jade City, not your old haunt Sky Bearing. You know how much danger you\u2019ve put yourself in by coming here, and yet you still did so. If you had no preparations, would you still brave such danger? This is the first reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cContinue.\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s face remained impassive, but there was a hint of laughter in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecondly, this is the territory of the Yu Family, and also their base of operations. You will definitely not stay for long, and since you purposely found a place close to the Yu Residence to stay, don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t have any plans! I don\u2019t believe that for even a second! As for the third point, since the Yu Family already knows of your arrival, then for every day you delay, the wariness of the Yu Family will go up by another notch. Thus, this lady can deduce that tonight is the best time for sneaking out!\u201d Li Xue chattered excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll these are only deductions, there\u2019s no concrete evidence. Aren\u2019t you being too far-fetched?\u201d Ling Tian remained unmoved. He didn\u2019t believe that Li Xue came over based on just the three points above. This lass wasn\u2019t speaking the truth, that much Ling Tian could tell. However, for her to come out with these three reasons in a split second left him in awe of her wit and intellect.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

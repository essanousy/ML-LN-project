Even Yu ManLou himself didn\u2019t think that he would be able to perform any better than what Ling Jian did!</p><br/><p>What a sharp assassin. There definitely aren\u2019t many in the world capable of being a match for him!</p><br/><p>Such a character was a natural born assassin!</p><br/><p>Thinking about that, Yu ManLou could already guess the other party\u2019s identity.</p><br/><p>Apart from the hidden Pavilion Head of the First Pavilion, there wouldn\u2019t be a second assassin in the world capable of performing such a feat! At the very least, the former number one assassin, Ye BaiFei, wouldn\u2019t be capable of doing so! Thus, he could only be considered the former number one assassin!</p><br/><p>However, this black dressed figure did it! Thus, he would be the number one assassin in the world!</p><br/><p>As such, Yu ManLou quickly made his way out and his displeasure from before was gone after knowing the identity of the black-robed man. He knew that if he did not make his appearance, his subordinates would definitely rush into the garden. With the strength of the First Pavilion\u2019s Head, at least four experts would perish if he were to launch a desperate all-out attack before dying!</p><br/><p>This loss was something which Yu ManLou wouldn\u2019t be able to bear. Especially when the black-robed man was already within his grasp. If he would still need to sacrifice the experts from his family, wouldn\u2019t it become a joke?</p><br/><p>Thus, Yu ManLou decided to settle the matter on his own!</p><br/><p>When Yu ManLou was 50 feet away from the garden, he said with a calm smile, \u201cI never imagined that the world famous First Pavilion Head would make a personal appearance in my Yu Residence. Yu ManLou is overwhelmed by favor and your presence truly brings light to our humble dwellings. If Pavilion Head is willing, ManLou is interested to have a good conversation with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The First Pavilion Head!</p><br/><p>No wonder!</p><br/><p>A commotion broke out and the twelve experts of the Yu Family revealed a look of enlightenment. No wonder his swordplay and movement technique were at such an unimaginable level.</p><br/><p>It turns out that he was the legendary number one assassin, the First Pavilion Head!</p><br/><p>The garden remained silent, and the First Pavilion Head seemed to have disappeared completely, ignoring Yu ManLou completely.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou chuckled lightly and muttered to himself, \u201cPavilion Head\u2019s martial arts are exceptional and your movement technique is shocking. \u2018The lives of all humans are in my hands, the winds and rains heed the First Pavilion\u2019. The First Pavilion has remained mysterious for the past few years and had single-handedly controlled the winds and heavens in the world. ManLou truly admires you greatly.\u201d Yu ManLou said while sending a concealed hand signal behind his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is truly a regret for Pavilion Head to visit my Yu Residence today. Pavilion Head\u2019s life is currently hanging by a thread in the garden and even if Pavilion Head has heaven-defying abilities, it will be impossible for you to retreat in such a situation! I believe that Pavilion Head is a smart individual and will understand that. Even though Pavilion Head is the number one assassin in the world, you are not the number one expert. As long as Pavilion Head can answer my one question and promise me something, all of our debts from before can be wiped clean!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, Pavilion Head has to honestly tell me which party hired the First Pavilion? The Ling Family? Shui Family? Xiao Family? As long as you answer that, Pavilion Head can make a full retreat. Second, this Yu truly hopes that I can work together with the world famous First Pavilion to fulfill our ambitions! What does Pavilion Head think of that? If Pavilion Head wishes to, any condition can be fulfilled!\u201d</p><br/><p>To Yu ManLou, it was far more worthwhile to subdue this mysterious assassin and the organization behind him. As for the fact that the First Pavilion killed many members of Northern Wei and their Yu Family, that was something that he couldn\u2019t be bothered with. One must not bother about the trifles to achieve something great. If the First Pavilion Head was willing to submit to him, even if his own son was killed by the First Pavilion, Yu ManLou was able to wipe off that grudge!</p><br/><p>Taking a step back, even if the First Pavilion Head wasn\u2019t willing to submit to him but was willing to say who hired him, even if Yu ManLou let the First Pavilion Head off today, he would be indebted to the Yu Family and definitely not take any missions related to the Yu Family anymore. It was more worth it to let off an assassin than face the revenge of multiple assassins!</p><br/><p>This was the heart of an ambitious individual!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s conditions were extremely generous and Yu ManLou was certain that even he would be tempted if he was in the First Pavilion Head\u2019s shoes!</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>The garden remained silent.</p><br/><p>A smile could be seen on Yu ManLou\u2019s face. Under the warm glow of the lanterns, this originally warm and cordial smile suddenly seemed so sinister, \u201cIf Pavilion Head wants to stay in the garden of my Yu Residence for long, ManLou will definitely welcome you and make you feel like you\u2019re home. But if Pavilion Head only wants to hide in the garden temporarily, ManLou has many means to force Pavilion Head to reveal yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the black dressed guards had already retreated silently and almost 300 white-robed individuals took their place. Very obviously, as Yu ManLou was talking, he secretly commanded White Jade experts to replace the ordinary guards.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was not frustrated in the slightest that the other party did not reply him, \u201cPavilion Head can also see for yourself that 300 White Jade experts of my Yu Family have surrounded you. I believe that Pavilion Head should be familiar with these White Jade experts. Previously Pavilion Head has fought the twelve subdivision heads of my Yu Family and should have personally felt the strength of their martial arts. I believe that Pavilion Head should understand that there won\u2019t be any room for you to escape under such an encirclement. ManLou will also be open with Pavilion Head; the strength that you see now is far from the true strength of my Yu Family. If Pavilion Head chooses to work together with my Yu Family, you will number one, be able to escape with your life and number two, the world will belong to us in the future. At that time, riches and glory will be within your grasp, and your name would be recorded in the annals of history. As men, how can we not vie for hegemony?!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was undeniable that Yu ManLou was truly extremely persuasive. His conditions were extremely alluring and tone extremely sincere. If the First Pavilion Head was not Ling Jian and just a standalone organization, it would be impossible for him to resist Yu ManLou\u2019s temptations in the face of life and death! Even if he wasn\u2019t willing to submit to Yu ManLou and chose to admit that the Shui or Xiao Family hired him, Yu ManLou would definitely not go back on his words!</p><br/><p>A pity\u2026</p><br/><p>The garden was still filled with silence, and only the sounds of the crackling flames could be heard. Yu ManLou seemed to have grown impatient as he shouted, \u201cFor Pavilion Head to not say a single word, do you really think that you will be able to escape with your life? As long as I command my subordinates to form a tight circle and search the garden inch by inch, I believe that Pavilion Head\u2019s whereabouts will definitely be revealed. Alternatively, I can choose to bring some firewood over and burn the whole garden down. At that time, where can Pavilion Head hide? Finally, even if I do not want to make a move, the sun will be out in a mere four hours. The moment the sun is up, does Pavilion Head think that you will be able to fly into the sky or hide underground? The only reason why I have not taken any action is that first, I do not want to sacrifice the lives of my subordinates and second, this old man cannot bear to kill a talent like Pavilion Head.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yu ManLou said those words, the Yu Family members in the surrounding were visibly moved.</p><br/><p>Even at such a moment, this wily old fox did not forget to raise the morale of his subordinates. In the garden, Ling Jian had already cursed Yu ManLou under his breath countless of times. However, his body remained close to the ground as he remained silent. Regardless of how many brilliant plans you have and even if you talk until you are dehydrated, this daddy here just will not come out!</p><br/><p>As long as there is a small gap, this daddy here will be able to charge out. Regardless of who wants to stop me, he will definitely have to pay a huge price!</p><br/><p>After waiting for a moment and seeing that the other party had no intention of responding to him, Yu ManLou\u2019s voice began to turn chilly, \u201cPavilion Head has not said a single word up until now. It seems that Pavilion Head really wants to become an enemy with my Yu Family? I hope that Pavilion Head will consider carefully!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head, why do you have to waste time talking to him. The First Pavilion killed many of our family\u2019s disciples and this Pavilion Head is the mastermind of it all. Such a vicious character will not shed tears until he sees the coffin. May Family Head issue the order for us to capture this vicious beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head, issue the order!\u201d Everyone began to echo.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou let out a long sigh. He truly felt a great deal of regret. The First Pavilion and Blood Slaughter Pavilion are the two largest assassination organizations on the continent. However, be it reputation, martial arts or success rates, the First Pavilion that had risen to prominence later was far superior to the Blood Slaughter Pavilion! If he could work together with the First Pavilion, Yu ManLou was confident that he would be able to gather all the necessary information for the First Pavilion so that they could get rid of all his enemies! Including Ling Tian and the Family Head of the Shui Family!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Yu ManLou truly did not wish to drop all cordiality with the First Pavilion. While the martial arts of this black-robed figure tonight were exceptional, more than half of his twelve subdivision commanders would be able to beat this black-robed figure. However, assassination was not something that relied solely on martial arts. With just the reputation of being the number one assassin in the world, Yu ManLou did not dare to say that he would definitely be able to avoid an assassination attempt if he were caught off guard!</p><br/><p>However, an assassin was no more than an assassin! An assassin would only kill for money, and the price was something that his Yu Family could definitely afford! Since you can be hired by others to kill me, why can\u2019t you be hired by me?</p><br/><p>If I can make them submit to me, they would definitely be a sharp sword by my side! This was Yu ManLou\u2019s wishful thinking!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

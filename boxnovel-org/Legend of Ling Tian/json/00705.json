Originally, their stock of arrows would have been able to last half a month but they had spent almost half of their arrows in just a short day and a half! These were the arrows that they had stolen from the 30,000 strong Yu Family army!</p><br/><p>Originally, Feng Mo only arranged for 2,000 men to guard the mountain, but after seeing the situation turning against them he quickly added another thousand soldiers. The 300 archers were also increased to 500! However, they were only able to barely hold on and the number of casualties had far exceeded their expectations!</p><br/><p>Despite the mountain road being narrow and them having the high point, they still weren\u2019t able to stop the ferocious attack of the Yu Family. In just a day and a half, the entire army had already gone through a full round of rotation! If not for the geography being to the advantage of the Divine Prefecture Empire, their defenses would have been broken many times over!</p><br/><p>Just like this, the Divine Prefecture Empire suffered from heavy casualties and the entire mountain was filled with injured soldiers. The experts that were hidden among the Yu Family soldiers had created a large amount of trouble for the Divine Prefecture Empire. Ling Feng, Ling Yun, and Feng Mo had split the 20 Blood Iron Warriors into two groups and almost had no chance to take a break.</p><br/><p>Feng Mo was extremely thankful that he did not choose to set up his defenses at the original location of the Yu Family\u2019s camp. If he had chosen to do so, the ferocious assault of the Yu Family troops would have overrun his defenses in a single day!</p><br/><p>They were truly too crazy! Feng Mo was angered to the point he cursed out loud. \u201cThis daddy here did not kill your father or snatch your wife, is there a need for all of you to be so full of hatred?\u201d</p><br/><p>While Feng Mo didn\u2019t kill their father or snatch their wives, his previous operation had killed off all of their descendants! Killing off all their descendants was even more hateful than snatching their wife or killing their father!</p><br/><p>Of the three unfilial acts, not having descendants ranked first.</p><br/><p>The entire hill was already filled with corpses. Hot blood soaked the ground and the thick layer of snow had been melted down into a large puddle of bloody water before being frozen into a blood-colored road.</p><br/><p>This mountain entrance and this mountain face had truly been turned into a mountain of blood and corpse!</p><br/><p>As the night deepened, Feng Mo, Ling Feng, and Ling Yun were seated around a camp stove in the middle of the tent. Regardless of how pure their inner qi was, it would be impossible for them to resist the bitter cold, especially after being exhausted by the consecutive battles.</p><br/><p>Around them, a series of suppressed groans could be heard and it was obvious that the owners of these groans were in great pain.</p><br/><p>On Ling Feng there were seven or eight places that were wrapped up in bandages with blood seeping out from the edges. On the side, both Feng Mo and Ling Yun didn\u2019t look like they were in a better state. In the glow of the fire, their faces were solemn and a look of hopelessness could be seen on their faces!</p><br/><p>Such an expression should not have appeared on any of their faces. They were all elites who had been personally nurtured by Ling Tian over the years. If anyone were to tell them that there would be a day where they would face being without hope, they would definitely unsheath their weapons and place their lives on the line. However, they actually felt a trace of hopelessness in their hearts at this very moment!</p><br/><p>The battle was truly too intense and miserable to the point they were on the verge of collapse!</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t afraid of death. It might come tomorrow or the day after and it wasn\u2019t anything to be afraid of.</p><br/><p>However, dying together with their 15,000 brothers was truly\u2026</p><br/><p>The flaps to the tent were flipped open and a cold gust of wind blew in. A figure then stepped into the tent and called out, \u201cBig brother.\u201d He was a Blood Iron Warrior.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are the casualties of our brothers?\u201d Feng Mo lifted his head and looked over anxiously with fatigue in his eyes. He truly wished to hear some good news!</p><br/><p>The eyes of the burly man dimmed as he said, \u201cUp until now, 3,317 men have died, 70 are severely injured, and 9,400 have light injuries. There are less than 3,000 who are completely unharmed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Silence enveloped the tent.</p><br/><p>Anyone who frequented the battlefield would understand what these numbers represented! All of them understood how cruel these numbers were! Apart from the number of fatalities and light injuries, those who were severely injured were almost negligible!</p><br/><p>This meant that both armies were placing their lives on the line! All those who were severely injured would not even have the chance to make a retreat! They would all end up dead on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf our 2,000 archers, only 1,300 are left. As for our inventory of arrows\u2026 it is enough for us to deal with three more waves of attacks. After three waves\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Mo let out a heavy sigh. They were trapped in a desolate situation without the slightest trace of hope! Without the suppressive fire of the archers, it would be impossible for them to defend the place by relying solely on a head-on battle. After all, the opposing army had ten times the number of soldiers and were death warriors who did not fear death!</p><br/><p>If they were on an ordinary battlefield, three waves of attack would happen over two or more days. However, the three of them knew that three waves of attack weren\u2019t considered much under such circumstances.</p><br/><p>In just this day alone, they suffered from nine waves of attacks! In the past four days, the Yu Family had attacked an average of seven times in a single day! There were dozens of archers who suffered from severe abrasions because they had pulled the bow far too many times!</p><br/><p>In other words, the remaining arrows from the archers would only be able to last for a single afternoon. After a single afternoon, they would have to engage in a head-on brawl!</p><br/><p>The moment they engaged in a head-on brawl, there wouldn\u2019t be any hope left for their army. The Yu Family would be able to constantly send fresh batches of reinforcements but their army had limited manpower without any reinforcements. How were they supposed to fight such a battle?</p><br/><p>The intense reaction of the Yu Family was truly out of Feng Mo expectations. Ever since they ambushed the Yu Family\u2019s camp, Feng Mo knew that the Yu Family would definitely take their revenge but they never expected the revenge to be so swift and crazy!</p><br/><p>Originally, Feng Mo was certain that he would have been able to defend the region for half a month with the resources that they obtained but never imagined to be at their wits end after four days! As compared to their loses, the losses of the Yu Family were many times more. However, the Yu Family had completely ignored all of their loses and poured in all of their reinforcements to launch waves after waves of attacks. After all, they were in the Yu Family\u2019s territory and the Yu Family would be able to continuously send reinforcements.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Feng, we are truly in an extremely precarious situation and it isn\u2019t a solution for us to continue defending. As such, I want to\u2026\u201d Ling Feng clenched his teeth and looked at Feng Mo before saying slowly, \u201cWhy don\u2019t Ling Yun and I sneak into the enemy camp and assassinate the commander of the enemy army? Even if we are unable to achieve a victory amid the chaos, we would be able to obtain a certain about of time.\u201d Hearing that, Ling Yun nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Definitely not!\u201d Feng Mo rejected it without even thinking. From the battles that they had over the past few days, Feng Mo could tell that the commanders of the Yu Family army were all top-notch martial arts experts. Just the few experts who hid among the ordinary soldiers to launch sneak attacks had given Ling Feng and Ling Yun a great deal of trouble. Despite suffering pretty severe injuries, they weren\u2019t able to capture a single person. How would Feng Mo be willing to let Ling Feng and Ling Yun take such a risk? This couldn\u2019t be considered a gamble any longer but was akin to sending them to their deaths!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy not? This isn\u2019t the first or second time that we performed such an assassination. Don\u2019t you trust our abilities?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t that I don\u2019t trust you but the times are different!\u201d Feng Mo worriedly said, \u201cAll of you were hidden in the dark in the previous assassination missions. With the element of surprise on your side, you were naturally able to take down your enemy with a single strike. However, the two of you have taken action more than once in this battle and have already exposed yourselves. The enemy will have their guard up against the two of you. Furthermore, there are plenty of experts in the enemy camp with a couple of them being superior to both of you. For the two of you to go in now would be akin to sending you to your deaths!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe definitely have to go and everyone is extremely clear about this. Even if we don\u2019t go, will the Yu Family let go of us? This is already our final chance!\u201d Ling Yun said coldly, \u201cThe moment we succeed, we would be able to let our remaining brothers retreat safely! We have to give it a try!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if the two of you die in the Yu Family camp, it would shake the morale of our soldiers. At that time, we would be defeated without the enemy even attacking! Have the two of you considered such a possibility? I would never allow the two of you to take such a risk!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them began arguing incessantly.</p><br/><p>In the still darkness, more than twenty figures flashed past the thick snowy ground in the mountain. Barely a trace of their presence was left behind and even if a slight footprint was left behind, it would be quickly swallowed up by the falling snow.</p><br/><p>Stepping onto the snow without leaving a trace! This was the skill of a XianTian expert!</p><br/><p>All of them were actually XianTian level experts!</p><br/><p>While there were only twenty or so of them, the killing intent that they emanated was as though the death reaper had descended to the mortal realm. Furthermore, there wasn\u2019t only a single death reaper! Being suppressed by this immense killing intent, all of the animals in the mountain did not dare to let out a single sound. Even the ferocious beasts like tigers and wolves weren\u2019t an exception! They were all afraid that the slightest bit of movement would attract a fatal calamity. After all, the instinct of animals was far superior to that of humans.</p><br/><p>At the very front, Ling Jian\u2019s face was cold with his long sword held in his hand. Every time he had traveled a short distance or made a turn, he would slash out at the tree beside him and leave a white mark. In the dark forest, this white mark was extremely eye-catching.</p><br/><p>However, regardless of the action he made, his figure would not be delayed for the slightest bit of time.</p></div>\n</div>"}

I made my deduction from that habit of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHabit? A habit in both my lives?\u201d Ling Tian was truly puzzled, \u201cWhat habit? Why don\u2019t I know about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you remember that you always wore a thin ring on your right index finger in your previous life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRing?\u201d Ling Tian fell into a daze, \u201cHow could I forget about it? It was the only item my mother left for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d Li Xue\u2019s voice turned hoarse, \u201cin your previous life you treated that ring as the most precious treasure of yours and also as a protective talisman. This is something that you also told me before. Before you embark on a mission or if you are uncertain about something, you subconsciously twiddle with the ring on your right finger. You once said that it would calm you down and ensure success in your mission!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s eyes then turned gentle, \u201cWhen you entered Bright Jade City this afternoon, while you were no longer wearing the ring on your right finger, you still subconsciously twiddled with your right finger. Furthermore, the look in your eyes was exactly the same as it was in your previous life. So\u2026 I managed to guess it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see!\u201d Ling Tian came to a realization but suddenly felt mournful. The ring from his previous life was the only item his mother left behind for him. Whenever he twiddled with it, Ling Tian could feel the deep love of his mother emanating from it, bringing him a boundless energy. Every time he twiddled with the ring, Ling Tian\u2019s heart would be filled with calmness. Thus, whenever he felt frustrated, Ling Tian would twiddle with it to calm himself down. This subconscious action of his was something that even he didn\u2019t notice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s no wonder that I lost in my previous life.\u201d Ling Tian laughed bitterly. For Li Xue to understand him better than he understood himself, it wouldn\u2019t be a difficult matter for her to lay a trap for him. Ling Tian had always felt that he had fallen to a sinister trap and was framed. Only now did he understand that the trap was specially targeted at him and it would be impossible for him to avoid it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019ge.\u201d Li Xue said with guilt in her eyes, \u201cWhile spending more than ten years in the mountains, I found some metal similar to your ring in my free time. After forging it over and over again\u2026 take a look at this, do you like it?\u201d Li Xue\u2019s palm opened up and a black ring could be seen in the center of her palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d After seeing the ring, the motherly love from both his life surfaced in his heart and an emotional look could be seen on Ling Tian\u2019s usually calm expression. Ling Tian looked at this ring which was identical to the one in his memory.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me help you put it on. This is my most sincere apology and my greatest blessing to you.\u201d Li Xue smiled and placed the ring on Ling Tian\u2019s right finger. She then let out a satisfied smile, \u201cAren\u2019t they almost identical?\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, Li Xue did something that made Ling Tian not know whether to laugh or cry. She took out another identical ring from her bosom and placed it on her right ring finger. With a crafty smile, she hid her hand behind her back and said shamelessly, \u201cHehe, I made a pair of these rings, one for you and one for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Tian glare at her, Li Xue chuckled and showed two fingers to Ling Tian, \u201cI only made two of them,\u201d purposely emphasizing the word \u2018only\u2019.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian gave a warm smile as he twiddled with the ring fondly, \u201cAnything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Li Xue said excitedly.</p><br/><p>Before Ling Tian could reply, a loud bang sounded from outside the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone is fighting.\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s face turned solemn, \u201cFurthermore, they are top-notch experts! What a miserable battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe battle is to our west and it shouldn\u2019t be too far away.\u201d Li Xue added on, \u201cShall we take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we have to go!\u201d Ling Tian slipped into black robes and said hastily, \u201cTo dare to fight openly in Bright Jade City at such a critical period, it would either be the Shui Family or Ling Jian. No other power would be that bold or powerful. I will only be at ease if I take a look personally. Even if I don\u2019t want to take action, I would be able to see the Yu Family\u2019s defensive arrangement! You are truly prepared. You have already put on the right outfit and can spring into action after putting on a mask. I truly admire your foresight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue could obviously tell that Ling Tian\u2019s words were meant to tease her about how she was clinging so tight to him. Thus, she stuck out her tongue and made a funny face as she grunted, \u201cSo what if I have foresight, it would be better than jumping out of the window without being fully dressed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian placed on his mask as he grumbled, \u201cIf not for you making trouble for me, I would already be gone by now. To think that you still have the cheek to make sarcastic remarks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue chuckled and opened the windows with a flick of her wrist. The next moment, they were already on the roof and looking towards the west. The sky was dark red in color and the sounds of miserable moans could be heard from time to time in the direction of the Yu Residence!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u2019 Ling Tian\u2019s figure vanished and appeared 60 feet away in an instant! Li Xue\u2019s figure then flickered and she followed closely after Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>Even if the ones fighting weren\u2019t Ling Jian, it would be a fantastic time for Ling Tian to fish in troubled waters! Perhaps, he could even hit the Yu Family when they were down. Even though Ling Tian didn\u2019t intend to visit the Yu Residence on his trip to Bright Jade City, with the opportunity knocking on his door right now, it was impossible for Ling Tian to miss it.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, if the one fighting belonged to his faction, Ling Tian would definitely regret it for life if he didn\u2019t go!</p><br/><p>At this point, Ling Tian definitely didn\u2019t expect that his action would save the life of his closest brother!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the raging flames, Ling Jian was like an unkillable devil, with the sword in his hands like a reaper. Every time his sword was brandished, blood would be seen and lives would be taken.</p><br/><p>A black-masked man darted around the Yu Residence\u2019s garden like a shadow. There were a few times when the figure managed to make it up the top of the wall but was quickly forced back down by the Yu Family\u2019s disciples at the risk of their lives! Regardless of who he fought, he would never drag out the battle. If his first attack wasn\u2019t successful, he would be tens of feet away the next moment!</p><br/><p>The ground was filled with corpses all over with the wounds on all the corpse being exactly the same: a red dot on their throat! This small little red dot had robbed all of them of their lives!</p><br/><p>The Yu Family\u2019s experts could finally witness for themselves the frightening combat prowess of the First Pavilion Head! He truly lived up to the name of the number one assassin! He weaved around the battlefield like a gust of wind as though he was a shadow that didn\u2019t feel fatigue. The many members of the Yu Family were extremely solemn. While the First Pavilion Head\u2019s martial art was not at the apex and he was merely a small success XianTian cultivator, the depth of his cultivation, the exquisiteness of his swordplay, and strangeness of his movement techniques combined made him a huge headache to deal with! Each and every strike of his would take away a life! If the members of the Yu Family didn\u2019t witness it for themselves, they wouldn\u2019t be able to believe that such a cruel and accurate swordplay existed in the world!</p><br/><p>This was swordplay that was created only to kill!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou stood far away as he watched the battlefield unblinkingly. Yu ManLou could tell that the black-masked man was very quickly exhausting his stamina, inner qi, and energy with the only thing undiminished being his battle and killing intent! The coldness in the eyes of the black-masked man had not changed from the start to the end!</p><br/><p>The number one assassin in the world indeed! Yu ManLou praised in his heart. With a wave of his right hand, two experts who had been watching from the side shot into the air.</p><br/><p>They\u2019re coming!</p><br/><p>Ever since the start of the battle, Ling Jian had been carefully maintaining his stamina and had not used more than 80% of his strength just so he could wait for this moment!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian had purposely concealed his strength to allow his opponents\u2019 to misjudge him so that he would lure the true experts of the Yu Family into the fray. If those experts were to guard the various exits, then Ling Jian would truly be like a beast trapped in a cage. As long as a top-notch expert of the Yu Family joined the fray, Ling Jian would be able to first, find an opportunity to kill the expert and second, create chaos and escape. Even if he wasn\u2019t able to escape, he would ensure that the Yu Family would pay a huge price! Even if he were to die, he must ensure that his death was worth it!</p><br/><p>These two top-notch experts joining the fray were the Head and Vice Head of the Firmament Charging Pavilion. They were inseparable from each other and apart from exceptional martial arts, they were wise and resourceful individuals.</p><br/><p>With a swirl of his sword, the two white-robed individuals in front of Ling Jian lost their arm and let out a mournful wail. Following that, Ling Jian\u2019s black figure dashed forward and the White Jade experts in the surrounding assumed that Ling Jian wanted to charge out of the encirclement. Due to the order which Yu ManLou had given them, they all dashed forward in an attempt to block Ling Jian without a concern for their own life. Behind Ling Jian, the two Pavilion Heads of the Firmament Charging Pavilion also sped up towards Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>Without a single sign whatsoever, Ling Jian\u2019s figure that was originally charging forward stopped abruptly and spun around at an even faster speed. A brilliant sword light then burst forth from his sword and slashed down towards the two top-notch experts behind him.</p><br/><p>Facing the sudden sword strike from Ling Jian, the two top-notch experts couldn\u2019t help but be startled. Even though they knew that their opponent\u2019s sword was about to reach them, it was far too late for them to slow down and they charged right at the fatal sword strike!</p><br/><p>At this moment, both the Pavilion Heads felt their backs turn cold!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

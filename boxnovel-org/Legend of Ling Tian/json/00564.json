He held himself back, merely giving a bland smile, but one could see the rims of his eyes turning red.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed and patted his shoulder before turning to Ling Chen. \u201cThe commands will be passed down by you. Those elites who are sniping will be personally chosen by Ling Jian, and when they are ready to move, asking Ling Jian to report to me will suffice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen respectfully called out before turning to leave, her footsteps light and graceful. Within her heart, there was still some form of happiness. One had to know that Ling Tian\u2019s previous words would be considered extremely soft-hearted in the eyes of a military advisor. It might even affect the entire operation, but to Ling Chen, she could feel the warmth within those words. It showed just how sentimental Ling Tian was as a person. While he might be ruthless and even despicable to his enemies, he would fully protect his own people, be it Xiao YanXue, Yu BingYan, or even her! To think of it, when he rebelled against Long Xiang, wasn\u2019t it because of her, this mere servant girl?</p><br/><p>With Xiao YanXue and Yu BingYan, one belonged to the Yu Family and one the Xiao Family. Both were from influential families that were the biggest obstacle to Ling Tian obtaining all under heaven. However, Ling Tian was actually able to come out with such a surprising decision to ensure the emotional well-being of his women. If compared with another ruthless character, who else would care about something other than his ambition? However, Ling Tian cared, and very much so. While this might pose problems in his road of world domination, Ling Tian had long decided to do just that.</p><br/><p>Annihilating the Xiao and Yu Families went without saying! However, the lives of those who had a relationship with one of his women had to be considered. This sentence already fully spoke of Ling Tian\u2019s unique insistence and also spoke volumes about how much Ling Tian loved his women!</p><br/><p>In this world where wives were like clothes but brothers like one\u2019s hands and feet, a woman\u2019s position was extremely low. From a woman\u2019s point of view, for Ling Tian to do this was extremely precious to them.</p><br/><p>It is easy to exchange for priceless treasures, but it is difficult to obtain the perfect husband.</p><br/><p>This was why Ling Chen was happy and touched.</p><br/><p>Turning back, Ling Tian laughed, \u201cAdvisor, now that we have been unburdened, come come, I still haven\u2019t had the pleasure of trying your tea leaves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe also let out an unrestrained laugh. \u201cSince young noble wants to enjoy himself, then Meng LiGe will accompany you to drink to our heart\u2019s content.\u201d As he spoke, the two exchanged a glance, understanding each other\u2019s thoughts as they shared a smile.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Rumors spread all over the place!</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Star Continent became a haven for rumors all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>Rumors suddenly became a synonym for news, and what was considered accurate news could no longer be found!</p><br/><p>The first rumor was that the Sky Bearing Empire\u2019s young noble Ling Tian was killed by the Martial Order Medallion and that Justice had already gone back to Beyond Heavens, returning the Martial Order Medallion. The Ling Family had already secretly brought his body back to Sky Bearing, and in order to prevent the armies from growing uneasy, chose to keep it a secret.</p><br/><p>The second rumor said that while the Martial Head was in pursuit of Ling Tian, he fell into his trap and was killed by Ling Tian! As such, Ling Tian had now taken over the position of Martial Order Medallion owner, becoming the new top expert, a new hero of this generation! Furthermore, the details of how the fight proceeded, how Ling Tian counterattacked as well as how intense the final fight was spread all around like wildfire by the martial artists, as though they had been there on the scene. The narrative was vividly and brightly colored, and spittle sprayed everywhere as they talked, causing everyone to stare dumbfounded at them\u2026</p><br/><p>From time to time there would be opposing rumor mongers that would gather together. There would even be a few who started to fight with each other, trying to choke each other while insisting that their side was the truth and that the other party was spewing nonsense\u2026</p><br/><p>In this event, the Heavenly Star Continent seemed to have become a lively market that revolved around finding the entire story. There were people who were suspicious, people in disbelief, people viewing this affair with schadenfreude. The entire continent seemed to have become a pot of boiling water, bubbling in excitement.</p><br/><p>As the two strong rumors were duking it out, along came a splash of cold water which caused the faces of everyone present to change. A third rumor rapidly spread out!</p><br/><p>\u2026 Do you know why the Ling Family\u2019s 200,000 troops are stationed at Southern Zheng? Hehe, the Ling Family already formed an alliance with the Xiao Family and is waiting for them to arrive before the two families work together to swallow Southern Zheng and unify the world\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026 I also heard that when the two families destroy Southern Zheng, they will draw out a boundary, with the East belonging to the Xiao and the West belonging to the Ling. They even have a name for it, the \u201cLing Xiao Boundary River\u201d. My news is accurate!</p><br/><p>\u2026 I even heard that the Xiao and Ling Families were longtime friends and their Old Sires have been sworn brothers for over a decade. If the Xiao Family don\u2019t look for the Ling Family, then who else would they find? Now that the Ling Family has gotten some benefits, of course they have to share. Besides, the Xiao Family\u2019s little princess is even betrothed to the young noble Ling Tian! Actually, when they broke the marriage betrothal that year, it was all a ploy to fool the public. Even the attacks of the Xiao Family on the Ling Family were all an act, merely a ploy. While everyone was stupid enough to believe, I am someone with a good mind and can clearly see\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026 That\u2019s right, hahaha, looks like Southern Zheng is in for it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026 Yeah yeah, I heard that the Xiao Family\u2019s armies were about to arrive. Looks like they\u2019re already planning to attack soon\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026 The Ling Family is not just on the same line as the Xiao Family. You definitely do not know this, but the Ling Family has also allied with the Wu County\u2026 Don\u2019t believe it?! Screw you! This old man has personally seen the diplomatic group head towards the Wu County\u2026 Why would they even go there at this time? I assume that these things are going on, look at my sources, aren\u2019t they accurate?</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Weird, strange, preposterous. All sort of different news flew around the entire Heavenly Star Continent. Some were good, some bad, some useless, and some revealed important information. The entire Heavenly Star seemed to be like popcorn kernels in a heated pot, with the various rumors popping out and flying off to all corners of the world akin to locusts, whipping the crowds into a frenzy. The speed at which the news spread was faster than a hurricane and blew to every possible crevice of the continent\u2026</p><br/><p>In Northern Wei, Yu ManLou sat with a solemn face for a long moment as he listened to all these rumors that blanketed the world. Finally, he sent out his only command, \u201cAll troops are to move, and within the shortest possible time, occupy Western Han! Send word to the three pavilion heads, gather 500 men, and together with the Second and Third Young Master, to engage Above Heavens! Only success is allowed!\u201d</p><br/><p>When those Yu Family experts that had gone over to Sky Bearing came back to Bright Jade City in tatters after being defeated, Yu ManLou nearly vomited out a mouth of blood in anger. Those were a good half of the overall strength of the White Jade Experts in the Yu Family! To think that they were almost wiped out! He did not speak, merely brushing his sleeves before leaving, his original calm and unmoved stance no longer present. The next few days, the Yu Family fell into an oppressive silence, with all of the dead\u2019s families mourning cries sounding all over, giving Yu ManLou a massive headache.</p><br/><p>This was followed by the appearance of one of the three hidden sects of yesteryear, the \u201cAbove Heavens\u201d. 500 horsemen actually audaciously appeared in Bright Jade City, and what made Yu ManLou truly jump in anger was that they came with a pugilistic world greeting, looking to resolve a feud for their disciple. Their method was even more clear-cut: For both sides to send out an expert and fight it out! Whether they won or lost, the matter would be resolved!</p><br/><p>This was originally the most common method to resolve problems, but to hear this request now made Yu ManLou depressed to no end! The first problem being that the elites of the Lei Family were arriving soon, and the second being that it was a crucial time to gather their forces against the Western Han. Thirdly, the defeated forces had just returned from Sky Bearing with losses of up to 90% and they did not even have a person that returned unharmed, leaving the family in an anxious and depressed mood! For the Above Heavens Sect to choose this method to seek justice could be considered the best timing for them! This was the time when the Yu Family was at its lowest!</p><br/><p>Right now, Yu ManLou was feeling a headache over the troop\u2019s arrangements. The experts from each troop could not be transferred here. Also, he was not willing to bury all 500 of the Above Heavens disciples here. The first would cause great losses and the second\u2026 Above Heavens was the support for the Xiao Family and was Ling Tian\u2019s chief enemy! If he were to settle the Above Heavens people, wouldn\u2019t that give Ling Tian a breather? He originally intended to use the people sent to Sky Bearing since they had already exposed themselves, but looking at the tattered army Yu ManLou was at a complete loss for words. Having heard that Yu ZhanKong, an elder and an expert in the family, was ambushed by the Shui Family as well as an expert and was so scared that he could not sleep and even wet his pants, what sort of expectations could he still have towards the forces sent to Sky Bearing?!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, upon thinking of how he actually subconsciously aided Ling Tian, Yu ManLou was even more depressed! The two of them actually had wagered a bet, a grand bet as huge as the heavens themselves!</p><br/><p>In five years, a final fight under the heavens!</p><br/><p>But the damned Xiao Family was supposed to be taken care of by Ling Tian! The weaker their power and influence, the easier time Ling Tian would have to defeat them, and his odds would also be higher! However, Yu ManLou had to settle the problem with Above Heavens first. They were already knocking on his front door, for goodness sake! Could he choose to ignore them instead? Would the Above Heavens even allow him to?!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, this matter really had nothing to do with Ling Tian and was the Above Heavens themselves looking for him, the starting point being the fault of the third young noble of the Yu Family. Thinking about his son that failed to live up to his expectations, Yu ManLou\u2019s anger began to flare up even more!</p><br/><p>Thus, Yu ManLou was in a fine temper the last few days. This was as good as cutting off all contact, yet trouble still falls from the sky! <em>Another person\u2019s problem actually became my own? Are they taking the Yu Family as mud on the streets now? To think the Above Heavens still think of themselves as one of the three \u201cGreat Hidden Sects\u201d, while this daddy here cannot afford to offend you, don\u2019t think that I place all of you in my eyes!</em></p></div>\n</div>"}

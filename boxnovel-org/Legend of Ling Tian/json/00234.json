No matter whose idea it is, this matter\u2026 isn\u2019t a bad thing, right? It should be a good thing for our Ling Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed out loudly, and cut it short as his face grew even frostier, \u201cIf that\u2019s Aunt\u2019s idea, then I\u2019ll pretend I never heard it; but if the idea is from Long Xiang, hehehe\u2026 then he must be tired of living! A small emperor of a tiny empire, he\u2019s akin to an egg! For me to deal with him is as easy as slaughtering a chicken!\u201d Ling Tian spat out ruthlessly, his voice laced with disdain.</p><br/><p>The moment the words came out of his mouth, the entire chambers went deathly silent!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian actually called out the name of the Emperor in front of the Royal Consort and Princess? And he did not even attempt to hide it? Especially the sentence after that, was he tired of living? What kind of crime was that?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of guts do you have to say such things?!\u201d A wave of anger rushed through Ling Ran. Looking at the nephew she had pampered since young she was intensly angry. Her face had turned red as she shouted, \u201cHow dare you actually utter such blasphemous words! Are you not afraid that our entire family would be annihilated?!\u201d At the side, Princess JiaoYue stared at Ling Tian with frightened eyes, thoroughly cowed by his presence!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnnihilating our entire family?\u201d A crazed bout of laughter came from Ling Tian\u2019s mouth. \u201cHAHAHA\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er shared a glance with the Old Madam, both revealing helpless glances; they had long expected such a response from Ling Tian. Chu Ting\u2019er hurriedly placated Ling Ran, \u201cSister, Ling Chen is no ordinary person. Other than possessing great martial arts, she has also long become Tian\u2019er concubine! When we went over to save you, Chen\u2019er also put in a lot of effort, and she could even be said to be your savior! The Emperor has long known that Chen\u2019er has a husband. He had already questioned Ling Chen\u2019s origins when we were back in the palace. It\u2019s probably because you were unconscious that you didn\u2019t hear anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!!\u201d Ling Ran turned pale with fright. This was obviously Long Xiang\u2019s fault then! Regardless of how pretty and outstanding Ling Chen was, she ultimately belonged to somebody else! And it even was his own nephew! Especially since Long Xiang was the monarch of a country! Drooling over beauties was not a big matter, but to snatch the concubine of one of his subjects, wouldn\u2019t that make him the laughingstock of the century? How could he retain his dignity as a monarch? If the officials in the court knew about this, how would they react?!</p><br/><p>This was especially so for the only successor of the Sky Bearing\u2019s top family, Ling Tian\u2019s concubine! This was akin to cuckolding his own nephew! Once word gets out, how big of a wave would it cause? And how could the Ling Family take such an insult? Hand over their future head\u2019s concubine on a golden platter? Once the matter gets blown up, the Ling Family would definitely flip in fury!</p><br/><p>With Sky Bearing now in a state akin to a tightrope walker balancing up in the air, how could it be able to withstand the fury of the Ling Family? It would cause the destruction of both common stone and jade!</p><br/><p>While Ling Ran belonged to the Ling Family, she was unclear of the power of the current Ling Family, and also grossly overestimated the strength of the Imperial Court. If the Ling Family were to really revolt now, Long Xiang would most likely have no choice but to step down and abdicate his throne!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, what an awesome plan! First bestow a Princess, in order to gain the position of first lady of the Ling Family; next is to grant the title of crown prince to the newborn son, in order to buy favour of the Ling Family, and thoroughly lock the young and old generation in place. Finally is the matter of asking the Royal Consort to bring elegant ladies to enter the palace, knowing that she would bring in her own family. Then he would be able to snatch the peerless beauty from his own nephew, and thoroughly satiate his desires\u2026 three birds in one stone, respect, much respect!\u201d Ling Tian sighed in praise as he continued, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s mind really thinks fast! Even if things don\u2019t work out, he could attack and defend as he pleased, and with the crown prince left in the family, he believes that no family would want to miss this chance for a meteoric rise; and while they won\u2019t be happy, they would still endure! Aunt, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Ling Tian warmly smiled at Ling Ran as he asked.</p><br/><p>Ling Ran now fully understood the reason for Ling Tian flipping out! If another man were to come up to you and snatch your woman away, you would probably have the same reaction! Looking at Ling Tian\u2019s warm smile, Ling Ran could not help but shiver, and did not care about her dignity as the Royal Consort, immediately stammering, \u201cTian\u2019er, the matter isn\u2019t like this, Aunt didn\u2019t know that you\u2026 you and Ling Chen have already\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe you were totally ignorant,\u201d Ling Tian interrupted, \u201cBut your husband is definitely aware of it! Since he dared to move, hahaha, Aunt, this matter doesn\u2019t just end here! If you had asked me as the status of a Royal Consort, that wouldn\u2019t be too offensive, but if you were coming from the viewpoint of my aunt to request such a thing from me, hehe\u2026\u201d His tone was low, yet one could detect something that was on the verge of exploding out from within him!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stood up and turned to walk out of the chamber. Without turning back, he coldly continued, \u201cActually, I wouldn\u2019t mind letting the child in your tummy seat on the throne before he is born! After all, in part of him runs the blood of my Ling family!\u201d A wave of suppressive killing intent surged out from Ling Tian\u2019s body!</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian\u2019s figure got further away, in Ling Ran\u2019s heart, he seemed to be becoming a mountain which covered the skies and earth, pressing down from above, making one hard to breathe!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Tian!\u201d Princess Jiao Yue felt as though her heart had broken into seven or eight segments, her face pale and bloodless as her body threatened to collapse! The moment she heard Ling Tian say \u2018bestow a princess to secure the title of first wife\u2019, her heart felt like it was being cut apart. While she knew that she was merely a pawn in her father\u2019s hands used to win over his subjects, but to hear it from the younger cousin, what\u2019s more her future husband, caused her vision to darken and her to almost faint in grief!</p><br/><p>A complicated look shot past Ling Tian\u2019s face, but he did not turn. \u201cRest easy in the Ling residence, cousin; when the day comes when you don\u2019t want to be a pawn any longer, I\u2019ll give you the happiness you want. Actually, the thing I hate most is to always be under the control of others, and I believe that\u2019s the same for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he finished, Ling Tian\u2019s shadow suddenly vanished from the steps!</p><br/><p>Princess Jiao Yue stood dumbfounded on the steps, two clear streams of tears flowing down her cheeks! If this matter hadn\u2019t happened, maybe after marrying into the family, so long as she put in enough effort, both of them still could be in sync, living together in harmony and happiness! She knew recently that her cousin Ling Tian had actually only been hiding behind the signboard of \u2018number one silkpants\u2019, but was in fact well versed in character, literary talent as well as martial arts! Wasn\u2019t such a person the dream husband for many a woman?</p><br/><p>However, with today\u2019s matters, Princess Jiao Yue was trapped in between, unable to do anything! Her father\u2019s lust, as well as her mother\u2019s suggestion, immediately caused herself to be despised in the Ling Family! All her fantasies of an enchanting life with the man of her life, all disappeared with the wind!</p><br/><p>\u201cAii! Look at yourself!\u201d Old Madam Ling could not help but sigh out at Ling Ran, \u201cYou were totally ignorant, but just had to be the mouthpiece! Now that Ling Tian has really been moved to action from anger, this matter will not be easy to solve!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er coldly snorted in response. \u201cHow could this matter be blamed on Tian\u2019er? How heavy is the crime of snatching someone else\u2019s wife? So what if he\u2019s the emperor? Now that the flames of war have started, what could a small country amount to? Who knows, maybe by the end of the war, Sky Bearing will have disappeared! He actually dares to think with his p*nis, this shows that he is definitely pitting himself against Tian\u2019er. As such, he needs to be prepared for revenge! Tian\u2019er is already restraining himself. If it was Brother Xiao, hmph, he would have long ago killed his way into the palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pausing for a while, Chu Ting\u2019er viciously continued, \u201cThe moment our family revolts, then Sky Bearing would be the first to fall! At that point, I\u2019ll see if he still has the lust to think about Tian\u2019er\u2019s wife. Haha, he thinks ous Ling Family is a pushover? Even if Tian\u2019er doesn\u2019t say anything, I definitely will not agree! Even if I have to cause a commotion at the palace hall, I also want to ask, which imperial court has a rule of the monarch snatching the wife of a subject!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er had completely sided with her son, and took the opportunity to add some pressure on Ling Ran. While everyone knew that this was not the best time to revolt against the emperor, even if they did, the Imperial Court would not be able to do a thing! The best would be if Ling Ran could just suppress this matter, but if she could not, then based on Ling Tian\u2019s temper, Sky Bearing could prepare to have a change in dynasty! However, how far the Ling Family could go based on the flames of war raging now is yet to be seen!</p><br/><p>However, how could anyone expect Ling Ran\u2019s face to turn pale after Chu Ting\u2019er spoke, immediately falling into a dead faint!</p><br/><p>While the Ling family had their misgivings, the apprehension for the Imperial Family was even larger! When Long Xiang visited today, he casually asked about Ling Chen\u2019s identity from Ling Ran. Not being informed, she told him that Ling Chen was just a maidservant of Ling Tian! This put Long Xiang in great joy, while maidservant and concubine only had a word of difference, this word meant the difference between heaven and earth! Thus, he immediately requested for some ladies to be sent into the imperial court, and hinted for one of them to be Ling Chen.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, after Ling Tian had revealed his strength, Long Xiang had gathered a few of his court officials for a discussion, and they deduced with Ye QingChen\u2019s visit that Ling Tian had to be the hidden successor for the Beyond Heavens Sect! Being a disciple would mean that they could not involve themselves in any matters of the state, and even more unable to go against an Imperial Family. As such, Long Xiang relaxed his guard towards the Ling Family! He thought that even if they had ambitions, they still had the Beyond Heavens to stop them!</p><br/><p>With all this factors put together, Long Xiang felt secure behind a strong backer! But little did he know that this was a coincidental ploy that Ye QingChen had caused! This misconception would go to make him commit the worst mistake of his life, and also the greatest reason as to why Sky Bearing collapsed in the future!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

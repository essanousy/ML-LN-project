After a long while, he said, \u201cThe Yu Family\u2019s Snow Jade Sky Reversal Pellet is the last hope for sixth brother and the rest. We can only wait. While sixth brother and the rest can\u2019t wait, Yu LiuShui would definitely be even more anxious. Our only choice would be to make a gamble. However, we can think of a way to apply some pressure on Yu LiuShui to make him speed up.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that there aren\u2019t any other ideas? Perhaps we can try finding some famous physicians in the city\u2026\u201d someone else asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFamous physicians? The meridians of sixth brother and the rest are all ruptured and their inner core is damaged. Would there be a famous physician in the world capable of treating such wounds?\u201d That big brother said in a heavy tone, \u201cEven if we were to return to our sect, the sect master would be helpless in the face of such injuries! The only person in the world who might be able to treat such injuries would be Justice. But do you think that it is possible for him to help us? Apart from that, only treasures like the Snow Jade Sky Reversal Pellet would be able to save their lives. Believe me, there isn\u2019t a third way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone remained silent.</p><br/><p>The big brother then let out a sigh and said, \u201cIs there still no news of Ling Tian?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of them shook their heads together.</p><br/><p>The big brother lamented, \u201cPerhaps we have truly made a mistake. We should have killed Ling Tian first before battling Justice. Our forces are now in a horrible state, and our strength is less than half of our prime but we haven\u2019t even seen Ling Tian\u2019s figure. The responsibility of this matter falls on my shoulders and this old man will seek punishment from the sect master when we return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng JueChen consoled, \u201cBig brother, you do not need to blame yourself. After all, we all felt that our forces were more than sufficient to deal with Justice and we even thought that we were overly cautious. With the ambush of the three experts, we were certain that our preparatory work should have been perfect. How would we be able to imagine that Justice\u2019s strength was frightening to such a degree? The sect master and two elders are also in the wrong in regards to this matter. Furthermore, this was the instruction of the sect master in the first place. If not for the sect master purposefully hiding the news that Elder Meng RuoXu was dead, how would we have been so careless? Big brother is not in the wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>That big brother then said a cold smile, \u201cSomeone will definitely have to bear the responsibility of this failure. If not, how would we be able to give the Xiao Family an answer? It would be insufficient for any of you to bear the responsibility and if I don\u2019t take the blame, do you expect the sect master to take the blame instead? It is already inevitable for me to become the scapegoat, and it is impossible for me to escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then let out a sigh before continuing, \u201cIf we were to talk about Justice, we would definitely have to talk about Ling Tian as well. We originally thought that sending out eighteen top-notch experts to deal with Ling Tian and Justice would definitely be an easy affair. Even if we were to fight them both at once, wiping them out would be as easy as flipping over our palms.\u201d Everyone let out a dry cough and didn\u2019t know how to reply. Originally, all of them did indeed have such thoughts and felt as though they were trying to butcher a chicken with a gigantic ax. However, they never expected the reality to be entirely different! It was no different from trying to crack a rock with an egg! Since it was so difficult to deal with Justice, could it be that Ling Tian would be the same?</p><br/><p>As he said that, his voice turned mellow, \u201cJust dealing with Justice alone cost us ten experts! Furthermore, we weren\u2019t able to kill him or escape without injury. If not for the fact that he didn\u2019t want to aggravate his injuries, it would be impossible for us to even escape with our lives. He is truly an adversary who is difficult to deal with. As for Ling Tian, he was actually able to escape Justice for a few months! What does this mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>He studied the faces of everyone present before snorting coldly, \u201cThis means that even if Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts can\u2019t be compared to Justice\u2019s, they shouldn\u2019t be too far away! With only half of our strength left, would we be able to deal with Ling Tian? This old man is truly doubtful about this! Besides that, just where did Ling Tian pick up his martial arts from? How could a young man less than twenty achieve such stunning heights in his martial arts? Some people originally thought that his martial arts originated from Beyond Heavens but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case right now. This is truly too baffling! Could it be that he started training in his mother\u2019s womb?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis problem is something which everyone seemed to have purposefully left out. Or perhaps it would be Ling Tian concealing the matter too well. Or perhaps, it is because Ling Tian shone too brightly and everyone was attracted to him but not his background. Once this matter is exposed, it will definitely shake the entire world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone took in a breath of cold air and began to study this problem again. The more they thought about it, the more they felt that it wasn\u2019t so simple.</p><br/><p>The big brother then said in a heavy tone, \u201cIf Ling Tian\u2019s master is able to groom such a disciple capable of escaping from Justice for a few months, then could Ling Tian\u2019s master be at Justice\u2019s level? In fact, it is even possible that Ling Tian\u2019s mysterious master is even above Justice! Everyone here has witnessed the strength of Justice before and can think about just how a person stronger than Justice would be like.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan all of you imagine what the consequences would be if we were to kill Ling Tian?\u201d His cold gaze swept past everyone, \u201cIf Ling Tian\u2019s master were to take revenge for Ling Tian, what would we do? Would there be anyone in the sect capable of blocking such a character? At that time, our whole sect would definitely be buried alongside Ling Tian!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that final sentence, everyone\u2019s heart was seemingly pounded by a gigantic hammer as they thought about this frightening consequence.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was a genius, and this was undeniable. However, just how powerful would the person capable of grooming such a genius be? While it wasn\u2019t easy for a talent to seek for a good teacher, it was even more difficult for a teacher to find a satisfactory disciple! It was extremely rare for such a good match to be found, but Ling Tian and his master were obviously this good match. After painstakingly grooming such a brilliant disciple only to have him killed, just how would this expert react?</p><br/><p>Even an otherworldly expert who has detached himself from worldly affairs wouldn\u2019t be able to accept this cruel reality!</p><br/><p>While the master of a scholar may not be a scholar, did they dare to take this risk?! Especially the fact that this was the martial arts world and not the scholarly world!</p><br/><p>A heavy rock pressed down on the hearts of everyone present and they all felt that even breathing was difficult. However, Ling Tian, who was hiding atop the roof held in his laughter to the point his sides began to ache!</p><br/><p>That casual remark of him training in the womb was actually the correct answer! Ling Tian did indeed pick up his martial arts from the womb!</p><br/><p>Perhaps the truth would always be coincidentally uncovered!</p><br/><p>As for the master who scared the people below to the point they were about to wet their pants, it was no more than a big hoax. Even in his previous life, there wasn\u2019t a single person qualified to be his master. Ling Tian began to frown as he pondered over the possibility of using his \u2018master\u2019s\u2019 name to intimidate others.</p><br/><p>The analysis below continued, \u201cFurthermore, it isn\u2019t just Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts that aren\u2019t so simple. Currently, both the Yu Family and us are aware that Ling Tian is in Bright Jade City and right within the territory of the Yu Family. However, Yu ManLou has almost flipped the entire city over but was still unable to find Ling Tian\u2019s trace! Hehe, even though they know that Ling Tian was here to create trouble, they are completely helpless against him. I believe Yu ManLou must be feeling even more helpless than us right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian snickered in his heart as he thought, You aren\u2019t wrong to say that I am here to create trouble. However, my targets are both you guys and the Yu Family. This is something that you definitely won\u2019t expect. If you are able to guess this, I am afraid that you will be even more depressed than Yu ManLou. However, being able to make such a clear analysis of things shows that you aren\u2019t an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>Despite the bulk of his analysis being false.</p><br/><p>\u201cThus, we can only kill Ling Tian in secret! We must not let anyone know that our Above Heavens was the culprit!\u201d In the room, that big brother suddenly said with a violent and sinister tone, \u201cThe moment news of Ling Tian\u2019s death spreads, I don\u2019t believe that there is any power in the world capable of enduring the consequences! I don\u2019t think that any power in the world would be willing to endure the consequences!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right when he finished what he had to say, he let out another long sigh. It is truly impossible for us to stop halfway. At this moment, everyone truly understood what this phrase meant.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

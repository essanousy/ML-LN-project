However, its consequences were far worse than a simple leech!</p><br/><p>In order to treat Yu BingYan\u2019s Divine Black Negative Meridians and allow her to become a normal person, one had to first completely destroy that source of frosty negative energy!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian originally thought that this was akin to a special physique like the extreme Yin body women could have, and with enough Positive True Flames, one could change the situation from harm to benefit! He even thought of using his Divine Shocking Dragon Formula\u2019s internal positive energy to forcibly split and clash with her condition, reducing but not removing it completely such that she could practice the Divine Ice Formula like Ling Chen and benefit from it instead of being harmed. But all his plans went down the drain right now, as the situation was totally contrary to his expectations!</p><br/><p>If he were to truly forcibly dissipate the frost poison within her body and keep it within instead of expelling it out, Yu BingYan would turn into an ice sculpture in a matter of minutes and lose her life! This was because the frost poison within her far exceeded what a normal person could handle. Even Li Xue or Ling Chen with their experience in the Divine Ice Formula might not be able to handle it, not to mention Yu BingYan with such a frail body. When the time came, even if an immortal descended, her life could still be forfeit!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian circulated his internal energy through her once again, searching every nook and cranny, and before disturbing the frost poison from the Divine Black Negative Meridians, he quickly pulled out. He let out a breath of turbid air, his eyes springing open as he stared at Yu BingYan with a complicated look.</p><br/><p>To have such an extreme frost poison inside one\u2019s body, just how did Yu BingYan actually live through the last few years? If the same air was present outside, even an expert would be reduced to a state neither living nor dead, and Yu BingYan was just a gentle lady! Furthermore, because of her condition, she was unable to cultivate, and was as good as being a normal person! How could she withstand this poison for so long? How much pain had she suffered?</p><br/><p>Thinking about the indifference that Yu BingYan showed daily, Ling Tian\u2019s heart began to hurt with stabs of pain.</p><br/><p>Looking at this sweet-tempered beauty, giving him a look like she had no grudges or regrets, Ling Tian could sense that to her, his own safety was more important than that of her own body! They could not be put in the same position, as though comparing Mount Tai to a chicken feather!</p><br/><p>What sort of feeling was this supposed to be?!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian recalled at this time, what Ling Chen spoke to him about Yu BingYan when the Great Elder Yu ZhanShui came over. His heart could not help but surge in waves.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Ling Tian\u2019s woman!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I were to die now, what would be written on my grave is that I was of the Ling Family, with the maiden name of Yu, and not Yu BingYan of the Yu Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s heart contracted, and he suddenly involuntarily exerted strength on his hands, pulling the beauty into his own embrace.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan gazed at Ling Tian\u2019s face in bliss, feeling her loved one\u2019s internal energy surging through her meridians. She felt as though she was immersed in satisfaction. While she had a terminal illness and was possibly incurable, possibly even dying tomorrow, for her to be recognized by the person she loved and to have him by her side was enough! Really satisfying! <em>The Heavens are really generous to me!</em></p><br/><p>Suddenly, she felt Ling Tian\u2019s eyes turn weird, half touching and half emotional, followed by a fiery look as she felt herself being pulled forward into his embrace. He hugged her so tightly, as though he was afraid to let go\u2026</p><br/><p><em>So warm! </em>Yu BingYan\u2019s mouth twitched, wanting to laugh, but instead two streaks of tears rolled down her eyes, noiselessly vanishing on Ling Tian\u2019s shoulders\u2026.</p><br/><p>After a long while, Ling Tian solemnly spoke, \u201cYan\u2019er, did you feel any particularly unbearable pain in your body during this period?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lying on his chest, satisfied with just breathing in his smell, Yu BingYan narrowed her eyes as she lazily replied, \u201cNothing at all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Ling Tian shot her a suspicious look.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee\u2026 occasionally there would be outbursts, but they are more controlled and less painful than before.\u201d Yu BingYan laughed out, her little head rubbing delightedly on his chest as she murmured. Her joy was evident from her voice, that even this was already good for her, and she did not dare to ask for more\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOccasionally\u2026.\u201d Ling Tian brushed his chin against her soft hair, a pondering look on his face, \u201cWhat about the Great Cyclic Pellets I gave you. During this time, how many of them have you eaten?\u201d</p><br/><p>As though feeling something was wrong, Yu BingYan stammered out, \u201c\u2026. Only two\u2026.\u201d She recalled that Ling Tian had told her to eat the pills once every half a month, but after hearing of the effects from the Great Cyclic Pellet, on how eating one could produce an expert, she couldn\u2019t bear to eat more. Only when she could not take the pain did she actually eat one, and it was accompanied with a heavy sense of guilt. She thought that if Ling Tian\u2019s subordinates were to consume one instead, they could become the core strength of his army, and giving it to someone like her with numbered days was a waste, without even any use\u2026</p><br/><p>Every time she thought about this, she would feel that she was even more useless. Not only could she not help Ling Tian, she even became his burden. When she thought along these lines, she would feel even sadder and feel it even more of a waste to consume the pellet\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly two?\u201d Ling Tian frowned, unhappily replying, \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you to consume it once every half a month? Why did you only take it twice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan wiggled her body in discomfort, pleading, \u201cMy memory isn\u2019t so good, and I always forget\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian only snorted in response, picking up the root of the problem easily as his face sank, \u201cDid you not eat the pellets after knowing about their effect?\u201d The more he thought, the more he deemed it possible, and the colder his face became. \u201cYou want to leave them for me? To increase my strength? Or to increase my subordinate\u2019s strengths? Let me create an army of experts?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan could only answer miserably, \u201cTian\u2019ge, I was wrong\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sighed as he replied, \u201cYan\u2019er, you should be aware of your own body\u2019s condition. Of course, my initial purpose in refining the Great Cyclic Pellet was to increase the strengths of Ling Jian and company. However, with the addition of the thousand-year-old blood ginseng as well as the ice-fire lotus, the end result can not only increase cultivation but also curb your Divine Black Negative Meridians. Furthermore, a huge batch of 113 pellets was produced, far outstripping my original estimates, but everyone could only consume one. Even if you leave all for me, where am I going to find so many experts to raise? This sort of ferocious medicinal efficacy, if one\u2019s cultivation isn\u2019t at a certain realm, consumption will only cause the body to implode. Furthermore, those that I give the pellets to must first fulfill the criteria of being someone I can trust, or else if I end up grooming an unprecedentedly strong enemy, isn\u2019t that asking for suicide?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs such, I took what I needed and left the last 30 pellets for you.\u201d Ling Tian warmly gazed at her, stroking her face as he smiled, \u201cDo you know? I originally intended for you to consume them for a year, allowing the medicine to corrode the poison to a certain extent before I use my internal energy in tandem with the Great Cyclic Pellet to force the cold energy out. However, you actually did not follow my instructions, making me disappointed as we have missed the best time to cure your illness!\u201d</p><br/><p>In order not to induce her worry, Ling Tian purposefully reduced the amount of information regarding purging the cold energy out. If she knew how much danger Ling Tian would have to undergo in order to purge her poison, then she would never agree, maybe even choosing to secretly leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo I see\u2026 Tian\u2019ge, relax, I will be obedient in the future, ok?\u201d Yu BingYan had a guilty expression as she lifted up her face to look pitifully at Ling Tian, pleading.</p><br/><p><em>It seems like she still needs to calm down a little more. She looks depressed and sad,</em>Ling Tian thought to himself. As such, he sighed again, emotionally saying, \u201cYan\u2019er, do you still remember when we met, what I told you about being able to treat your illness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan nodded as she said, \u201cI naturally remember.\u201d She then let out a mischievous smile together with some embarrassment as continued, \u201cI remembered every single word Tian\u2019ge has spoken to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled in response as he chuckled, \u201cMy idea actually involves the Great Cyclic Pellet. Based on my instructions for you to consume it, after my cultivation increases, I\u2019ll work with Ling Chen, one front and one back, one push and one pull, to completely remove and toxins and let you recover to the peak of health! But who would\u2019ve known that you would be so disobedient, actually only eating two of the pills? Most likely, the remnant medicinal strength in your body has almost been exhausted, completely out of my expectations. For me to expel the toxin out of you, I guess I\u2019ll have to use a lot more strength this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan slowly exclaimed with an \u2018ah\u2019 sound, her eyes filled with worry as she nervously replied, \u201cThen\u2026 will it be dangerous for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian frowned and replied, \u201cIf we went according to the original plan, there would definitely be some danger, but\u2026. If you could do something, then it should be absolutely safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that thing? I\u2019ll definitely achieve it.\u201d Yu BingYan anxiously replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat something is from now on, within these three months, to take a Great Cyclic Pellet every ten days. You\u2019re not allowed to stop in between, and on the last day, you are to take two pellets at once, such that the positive energy will achieve a balance with the internal energy within your body. On that day, after you consume the pellets, Ling Chen and I will coordinate to force out your poison. I believe it will be something as easy as lifting our hands. However, if you still feel it a waste to consume, we will have to extend the duration we spend in purging the toxin, and thus the length we are exposed to it. If there are any slip-ups, it\u2019s easy to cause cultivation deviation, which will kill us! While we can achieve this plan without losses, if your illness flares up and we don\u2019t purge it out in time, you will lose your life! Yan\u2019er, we took great pains to reach this stage, don\u2019t tell me that you don\u2019t want to stay beside me for my whole lifetime?\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s face was unprecedentedly heavy, his tone solemn.</p></div>\n</div>"}

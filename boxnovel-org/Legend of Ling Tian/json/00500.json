Sister\u2026 should be prepared for any scenario to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou let out a sound of agreement, but her heart still disapproved a little as she remarked, \u201cSister does not need to worry, there will not be any problems.\u201d The moment she finished speaking, she paused for a while before she continued, \u201cSister Chen, since our families are now in a cooperative relationship, should you\u2026 take a look at my clansmen who came over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen contemplated for a while before smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s fine.\u201d Upon recalling the three youths of the Shui Family, an icy cold intent surfaced on her brows\u2026</p><br/><p>Having achieved her objective, Shui QianRou was full of happiness and bade farewell as she left.</p><br/><p>At this point, Li Xue suddenly appeared from behind Ling Chen, gazing at Shui QianRou\u2019s diminishing silhouette as she indifferently asked, \u201cShall we act?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen leaned back wearily, as she let out a soft sound of assent, her voice faintly discernible, \u201cSuch a huge affair gives me the feeling that we\u2019re treading on thin ice\u2026 if only young noble was here\u2026 we would have fewer problems\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue laughed, \u201cIf we were to leave any single matter to him, most likely he would be tired to death after a few days. Better than worrying for him, wouldn\u2019t you rather that he remained worry-free?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen let out a groan and grabbed onto Li Xue\u2019s slim waist as she grumbled, \u201cSister Xue, Chen\u2019er is really tired. But, I would rather be tired than sad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tenderly stroking the head of hair that was pressed on her stomach, Li Xue tenderly replied, \u201cFor him, we can do anything\u2026 and it won\u2019t be a chore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn\u2026 for him, even the worst of fatigue will disappear.\u201d Ling Chen lightly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegarding the documents of Southern Zheng, have you received them?\u201d Li Xue suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, and the Ling Family\u2019s military force is also in the process of assembling, slowly pressuring the Southern Zheng area.\u201d Ling Chen muttered. \u201cDon\u2019t move, Sister Xue\u2026 let me lean on you for a while longer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue could only let out a sigh as she thought, I seem to have become a nanny for Ling Tian\u2026 not only must I take care of him, but I even have to take care of his woman now! She could not help but inwardly laugh.</p><br/><p>For those in a leadership position, a single sentence can be a strategy, to the point that even a random thought coming from them could potentially result in a domino effect, not to mention meticulously planning for a scheme!</p><br/><p>At this point, the side of Northern Wei was already at the point where soldiers were all armed to the teeth, swords drawn as the clouds of war covered the area densely. War could happen at any possible moment. More than 100,000 soldiers were stationed at the fortress, ready to charge towards Western Han at the first signal! This overly conspicuous signal caused the people in Western Han to all tremble in fear. They could only put their all into war preparations, without developing any false fantasies. Were it the past Northern Wei, with the imperial court ruling over it, Western Han could still feel more relaxed, but now, the real authority lay within the millennium-old Yu Family, and thinking about their background would make one tremble in fear\u2026</p><br/><p>On the other hand, in Sky Bearing where the Ling Family ruled now, Ling Tian\u2019s father Ling Xiao had mobilized tens of thousands of troops, encroaching towards the South, finally setting up a gigantic campsite fifty to sixty li away from their territory, giving off an unyielding attitude! Towards Southern Zheng sending people to attack his own daughter-in-law, Ling Xiao displayed utmost resentment, demanding an explanation from them\u2026 and while Southern Zheng had offered compensation a few times, they were all arrogantly rejected by Ling Xiao, claiming that they had no sincerity behind the compensation\u2026.</p><br/><p>Having to compromise to such a large extent, yet having the other party say that their compensation had no sincerity, their intentions were quite obvious at this point. The monarch of Southern Zheng had long ago seen through the Ling Family\u2019s evil intentions, using this excuse to launch the war. Even if the assassination did not occur, sooner or later, they would still have come knocking with any random excuse in order to incite them to fight! Furious, Southern Zheng also began mobilizing their men, with an aura that was not disadvantaged in any way!</p><br/><p>The Ling Family\u2019s Second General Shen RuHu also brought over ten thousand troops, deploying them to the common border between Sky Bearing and Eastern Zhao, before settling down and waiting. This threw Eastern Zhao into a panic. Could it be that the Ling Family planned to war on two fronts? Or could it be that the ruckus at Southern Zheng was a ploy, and the real objective would be the East? The multitude of differing opinions made it hard for anyone to come to a concrete conclusion.</p><br/><p>Within the Ling Family Courtyard, the military advisor personally appointed by Ling Tian, Meng LiGe was displaying his scholarly abilities to the fullest by devising strategy after strategy, closely holding the battle progress of the two sides. The elites of the Courtyard were also all prepared to go out to war, eyeing the battlefield as they prepared to set off the moment the command was given.</p><br/><p>Under the influence of the Yu and Ling Families, the number one financial magnate, the Xiao Family, seemed to have felt the skies changing. They suddenly exposed all their hidden troops, quickly assembling and pointing in the direction of Sky Bearing and Gold Jade City, eyeing them covetously!</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Star Continent was suddenly covered in the clouds of war, however, it continued to brew without the \u2018rain\u2019 falling. The pressure enveloping the continent was at an extreme, and everyone was waiting for the point when a little spark would be enough to ignite the entire area!</p><br/><p>In just these few days, the state of affairs in Heavenly Star had become a nervous wreck. It was as though someone had started burning wolf dung to raise the alarm, for those in the know could already smell something unusual. While there were only a few influences involved in this operation, the three influences were basically the strongest three under the heavens, or at least within Heavenly Star, enough to determine the situation of the entire continent!</p><br/><p>Right now, the restless actions of all the predators at the top of the food chain would sink the entire world into the chaos of war!</p><br/><p>The people within the Heavenly Star Continent were just like the reptiles hibernating before the first sign of spring came, silently waiting for that signal to ignite. However, nobody knew if that signal would actually bring happiness or disaster.</p><br/><p>They could only wait for the rain of war to descend!</p><br/><p>As for the main character of the Ling Family, our great noble Ling Tian, he was actually bringing a peerless beauty along with him as he leisurely traversed in an unknown forest. Not only was his pace unhurried, he even took time during this escape from death trip of his to pick up and flirt with chicks\u2026 The journey was filled with tender sentiments akin to honey, with an unexplainable sense of springtime\u2026</p><br/><p>During this period, Ling Tian could feel the internal energy in his body mysteriously increasing beyond his past capacity with unsurpassed purity, just like observing a crystal clear spring in the mountains. Every time he finished a complete cycle, he would obtain a whole new sensation. This pleased him to no end.</p><br/><p>Could it be that the actual method of the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula was of such strength?</p><br/><p>As he was feeling out the effects of his internal energy, Ling Tian could also feel that today was different from usual, as he had spent the night out in the open rather than staying in an inn. The results of his cultivation last night far outstripped that when he was in an inn, which made him puzzled. However, recognizing this point, he decided to give up on finding inns to stay at, thus opting to bring Xiao YanXue around the forests to look for a place to pitch tents so she could rest. After that, he stationed himself outside the entrance, and indeed his cultivation speed actually rose.</p><br/><p>Under the boost provided to his cultivation speed, Ling Tian could also feel the ShanZhong acupoint in his chest producing some sort of extremely stable energy. This energy would permeate into his various meridians and guide his own internal energy flow, allowing more ease and less obstruction. While Ling Tian was unaware of the nature of that mysterious strength, he knew that his own internal energy cultivation was rising by leaps and bounds during this period of time, and it was all because of that strength! Ling Tian did not bother to worry about it because after he had reached the 12th layer of his Divine Shocking Dragon Formula, his acupoints had already long gained the ability to absorb the energy of heaven and earth. Ling Tian subconsciously felt that his body had produced this mysterious strength due to having obtained the orthodox formula!</p><br/><p>But there was a downside to staying in the wilds. He had to face the dissatisfaction of the great Miss Xiao. Having been clothed and fed the best since she was young, how would she ever enjoy such a scenario where she had to sleep on the cold hard rocks of the wilderness, causing her body to ache. How could this little girl with soft and supple skin endure such torture?</p><br/><p>However, Xiao YanXue thought of an idea later on, which was to open up the tent and situate herself half in and out of the tent, using Ling Tian as a pillow. However, what happened next was that while she slept, she would unrestrainedly end up crawling into Ling Tian\u2019s bosom, causing our poor Ling Tian to scream internally in grief even while he cultivated.</p><br/><p>Physically, there was no problem with letting her do so, as when Ling Tian cultivated, his body would take in the energy from the atmosphere, thus he would not feel any burden on himself. However\u2026 Ling Tian was, in the end, a hot-blooded youth in his prime! Having not vented for quite a while, he would definitely feel something! This was where the trouble started.</p><br/><p>A sweet smelling, marshmallow-soft body without any guard lying on his chest, but yet he did not dare to do anything, nor could he\u2026 If anything happened he would need to take responsibility, and before Xiao YanXue got rid of her infatuation towards him, he did not dare to accept this responsibility\u2026</p><br/><p>As such, Ling Tian became more and more uncomfortable. That petite body with curves, that heaven-toppling beauty, as well as her womanly scent caused little Ling Tian to be at the fullest attention, especially in the early morning. Sometimes, little Ling Tian could even go on for a few hours without losing attention, and in order to relax, Ling Tian could only run to the ice-cold mountain spring in the wee hours of the morning to bathe. Even as he bathed, he could feel the icy cold water growing warm\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian angrily let out sigh after sigh. How was he supposed to go on living? After suppressing it for so long, he was even starting to hurt down there\u2026 If it goes on like so, this young noble could prepare to become like the Invincible East\u2026 1 At times, he simply just wanted to push down this little lass and get it over and done with, but upon thinking twice, it was only just a thought, and he had to push it to the back of his mind. Falling into this temptation would only result in grave consequences\u2026</p><br/><p>As for Xiao YanXue, she actually took on an aggressive stance after finding out that Ling Tian didn\u2019t dare to touch her. That little lass actually reversed the roles of host and guest, teasing Ling Tian day and night without stopping, such as\u2026 her shirt would suddenly be half open, and suddenly\u2026 a pale white thigh would stick out\u2026 and to the point that upon seeing a little white rabbit, she screamed and jumped into Ling Tian\u2019s chest, then began to lightly grind\u2026. Then she would watch as Ling Tian began to breathe heavily, and just as he was about to morph into a wolf, he would wake up and run far away. Xiao YanXue would then burst into laughter at his bedraggled look\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

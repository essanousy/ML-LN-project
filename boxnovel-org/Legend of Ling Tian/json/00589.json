The ancient Heaven Splitter! The Heaven Splitter which signifies the ownership of the world! We gave you the entire world but you are using it to kill? How how how\u2026 preposterous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was rendered speechless for a moment, then said \u201cThis is a peerless killing weapon after all! What is wrong with using it to kill? Besides that, the world must be fought for and my enemies will not surrender the moment I take out this sword. Hahaha, what a joke. Even if you guys are the number one sect on the continent, do you guys think that the continent is for you to give away? The ruler of the world is not someone for you guys to appoint!\u201d</p><br/><p>The white-robed scholar was angered to the point his lips trembled, \u201cNon\u2026 nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Ling Tian smiled calmly, \u201cIf you guys think that you can appoint the ruler of the world, then alright then, I shall accept this appointment. You guys should go and announce this to the other powers on the continent that I am the ruler of the world so that they will all surrender to me. As long as they surrender obediently, the world will be under my rule. After accepting your arrangements and the continent that you have given to me, I will owe you a huge favor. How about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them were completely baffled and the white-robed scholar stuttered, \u201cThis\u2026 our sect has always separated ourselves from secular affairs, how can we persuade your enemies for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible?\u201d Ling Tian let out a weird smile, \u201cThen how are you guys going to give the world to me? How are you guys going to appoint me to be the ruler of the world? You guys aren\u2019t even willing to give out any news and only your sect is aware of my possession of the Heaven Splitter. Are you guys going to give me the world like this? Are you guys going to make me, Ling Tian, owe you guys a favor without doing anything? What a joke? What can a sword represent?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stretched out his hands and grabbed onto another pig\u2019s leg before handing it over to the white-robed scholar.</p><br/><p>The white-robed scholar looked at Ling Tian with a doubtful expression. After thanking Ling Tian, he received the meat but kept it far away from his white robes. Ye QingChen smiled and took two steps back with the woodcutter. According to his understanding, Ling Tian probably had another sly idea up his sleeves again. It would be best for them to keep some distance.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had a bright smile on his face, \u201cThis wild boar\u2019s leg is the symbol of authority of the Heavenly Wind Continent. I am going to give it to you right now. As long as you take it to the Heavenly Wind Continent, you will become the ruler of the continent. Do you think it is possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wild boar leg? The symbol of authority? By the time he took it to the Heavenly Wind Continent, it would have probably become rotten\u2026</p><br/><p>The white-robed scholar held the wild boar\u2019s leg in his hand and went into a daze for a short while. His face then turned ashen as he roared, \u201cYou are going to anger this old man to death!\u201d His anger then assaulted his heart and he collapsed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>The woodcutter shot forward and just when everyone thought that the woodcutter would support the white-robed scholar, the woodcutter grabbed the barbecued leg in his hand and took a big bite. With his mouth full of oil, he praised, \u201cThis truly tastes good. How about you roast another leg for me? A single leg certainly won\u2019t be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>The white-robed scholar had no one to support his collapsing body and he collapsed onto the ground without any cushion whatsoever.</p><br/><p>Li Xue chuckled and took out a tael of silver from her sleeves. Placing it in Ling Tian\u2019s hands, she said, \u201cTian\u2019ge, this tael of silver symbolizes the ruler of the universe. From today on, you will be the Jade Emperor. Hurry up and take up your position\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian burst out laughing and winked at Li Xue. \u201cWho knows, this old fellow may be angered by me to the point there is internal bleeding in his head.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue pursed her lips, \u201cHe deserves it. Who asked him to act so high and mighty? Just a broken sword that will create trouble for you and he seems to think that Beyond Heavens has given you a huge favor. Just looking at him makes me angry and its best for him to fall to his death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face cramped up as he thought to himself, <em>This lass is even more vicious than me.</em></p><br/><p>A short while later, the white-robed scholar who lay on the ground motionlessly suddenly stood up straight as though he was a living zombie. It was as though there was a person supporting him from the back and pushing him up slowly. He had actually displayed his pure inner qi.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked towards the sky and let out a sneer as he thought, Is there anything here worth showing off? Even Ling Chi can do this!</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian, do you have any thoughts about our Beyond Heavens?\u201d the white-robed scholar said with a mellow tone. A cold glare flashed past his eyes as his battle intent oozed out. Seeing the situation turning bad, Ye QingChen took a few steps forward with an awkward expression on his face, ready to stop the fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThoughts? None at all.\u201d Ling Tian shrugged his shoulders and smiled, \u201cThey are just your own thoughts about Beyond Heavens and not mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur own thoughts? What do you mean by that?\u201d The eyes of the white-robed scholar narrowed. The way he saw it, Ling Tian was only humiliating him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would Beyond Heavens become the number one hidden sect in the world?\u201d Ling Tian sneered, \u201cA thousand years ago, Beyond Heavens led the pugilistic world into the battle of the three continents and not only did Beyond Heavens emerge victorious, they even preserved the strength of our Heavenly Star Continent. After that, Beyond Heavens contributed greatly to the peace of the continent and the pugilistic world. Thus, everyone respected Beyond Heavens and was willing to recognize Beyond Heavens as number one under the heavens. This is because the heart of the people was with your sect and not because of your peerless martial arts. It was also not because of your sheer numbers or strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was a little displeased. <em>So what if Beyond Heavens was the number one sect? You can\u2019t treat everyone else like the fool as well. Casually giving me a sword and saying that it represents the entire continent. Isn\u2019t this too exaggerated? This young noble has to exhaust millions of soldiers to fight wars all over the continent so that the continent will be within my grasp. At the end of the day, I still have to owe your Beyond Heavens a huge favor?! You guys do not want to do a single thing and get the biggest slice of the cake? You guys must be dreaming!</em></p><br/><p><em>If you are trying to swindle this young noble, this young noble won\u2019t care if you are number one in the world! If you expect me to remain silent and accept such a loss, impossible!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, all of these merits were done by your ancestors of a thousand years ago and has nothing got to do with all of you. In the past thousand years, what have you guys done for the commoners? Probably nothing right? All of you have only inherited Beyond Heavens or perhaps the pride of Beyond Heavens. Currently, what does Beyond Heavens have to be proud of? What right do all of you have to use the accomplishments of your ancestors to command the world?\u201d Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a great joke? Even after a thousand years, you guys are still living in your past glory? You still dare to act with such righteous confidence?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTouch your hearts and ask yourselves, are you guys living up to the glory of your ancestors? Martial Order Medallion? It is only a tool to protect the peace of the world but you guys are actually treating it like the summoning order of an assassin! The medical skills that your sect has passed on over the years are for you guys to save the world with, but you guys are only willing to save a life with a single medallion? You guys would rather hide deep in the mountains rather than come out to save people? Not letting you guys dabble in the conflicts of the world is so that Beyond Heavens is able to uphold justice in the world. But where is justice? Being detached from worldly affairs, what a nice way of putting it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s gaze was like a sword as he said mercilessly, \u201cAll of you have completely twisted the meaning of those words and hidden in the depths of the mountains but still treat yourselves like the messiah? Having the ability to contribute to the empires and save the commoners but generation after generation rots away like the crops of the land. Let me ask you, how many of your sect members over the years have heaven shaking medical skills but have never saved a single person? Then what do they study medicine for? Did your ancestors pass down all of these skills just so that all of you can kill time with it? Ridiculous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen, the white-robed scholar, and the woodcutter were completely drenched in sweat after hearing what Ling Tian\u2019s criticisms. The white-robed scholar was filled with sweat all over his face and despite wanting to retort against what Ling Tian had just said, he realized that he was unable to do so. With just a couple of sentences, Ling Tian had completely flipped the ideals that he had been living by for the past few decades.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian took two steps forward and continued, \u201cAs for I, Ling Tian, my intention to rule over the world is definitely not so noble either and it can be said to be for my own selfishness and ambitions. However, after I rule over the entire world, I can ensure that the continent will be peaceful for the next few decades. At the very least, there won\u2019t be any conflict for the next century and the commoners of the world will be able to lead a peaceful life. Even though it is for my own selfish ambitions, it is also for the happiness of the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile millions will lose their lives in the process of fighting for hegemony, after the world is united, there won\u2019t be anyone who will suffer from the bitterness of battle! Before the world is united as one, there will be frequent battles between the empires and this is true throughout the three continents! At least a million will die every year and while millions will die in the process of me fighting over hegemony, it is only the combined figure of a couple of years. However, the long peace that will follow after can last for at least one century or even longer! Even if it is only a hundred years of peace, do you know what this hundred years would signify? Do you know what benefits a hundred years of peace would bring to the continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026 is there no other method to unite the world apart from slaughter?\u201d the white-robed scholar asked weakly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSlaughter? How would there be unity without slaughter? Another method? Haha\u2026 do you think that we can create peace in the continent with a book in our hands? Complete nonsense! The only way to quench the wars of the continent would be to use the cruelest methods and fastest speed to unite the world! Even if the world falls into chaos again after a few hundred years, we would have created our own peaceful generation at the very least!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed out heartily and spread his arms out wide towards the starry night as though he wanted to embrace the entire world in his arms, \u201cI will admit that my hands are drenched with blood and my body is full of sin. Even if I kill people like they were ants with a mountain of corpses behind me, I can face up to my conscience! However, all of you do not interfere in worldly affairs and have a body full of skills but let it go to complete waste. Not only do you guys fail to live up to your own conscience, you guys are sinful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian glared at the white-robed scholar and shouted, \u201cSinful! Sinful to the world, sinful to mankind and sinful to yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong!</p><br/><p>The white-robed scholar felt as though a hammer pounded down on his heart and he took a few steps back with his face blanched completely white.</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen let out a long sigh and lamented with endless regret, \u201cLittle brother is right, all of these years, our Beyond Heavens has been\u2026\u201d As he said that, his tone became hoarse.</p><br/><p>After a long while, Ling Tian looked at Ye QingChen and said, \u201cIt is not too late!\u201d</p><br/><p>The white-robed scholar let out a long sigh to the heavens with desolation in his voice. Ling Tian\u2019s previous words were like a bucket of cold water being dumped on him. The white-robed scholar felt his mind become clear as though he was awoken from a long slumber.</p><br/><p>He took a few steps forward towards Ling Tian with the arrogance in his eyes completely gone. Fixing his gaze onto Ling Tian, he bowed down respectfully, \u201cThank you for your pointers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian went silent for a moment and upon seeing the other party\u2019s sincerity, he replied, \u201cThis little one was rude.\u201d</p><br/><p>The white-robed scholar straightened his back and said with solemness, \u201cNo! You guided us back to the right path and young noble Ling is the greatest benefactor of our Beyond Heavens! Even a hundred bows would not be able to display a fraction of our gratitude. After hearing the words which you have spoken today, this old man is filled with guilt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian replied sincerely, \u201cThere are still many more days to come, why does Sir have to act in such a manner?\u201d</p><br/><p>The white-robed scholar shook his head and a look of embarrassment could be seen on his face.</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen suddenly thought of something and asked, \u201cWhy is little brother here alone? Does little brother have something to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a cunning smile, \u201cThat\u2019s right. The experts of Above Heavens are about to pass by here to ambush my Sky Bearing. Ling Tian is here to await their arrival and unleash a massacre.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woodcutter walked forward excitedly, \u201cAbove Heavens? Those b*st*rds who ambushed Justice a while back? D*mmit, count this daddy in as well! I just ate a leg of yours and I can\u2019t just take it for nothing! Your words also made a lot of sense and this daddy here thinks that you\u2019re pretty good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just ate my leg? Ling Tian burst out into a sweat and tried to reject him, \u201cLing Tian thanks elder for your good intentions\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The white-robed scholar suddenly took a step forward and said, \u201cAbove Heavens has been mortal enemies with our Beyond Heavens. Young noble Ling Tian is doing this for the welfare of the entire world. How can we allow those ghostly creatures to create trouble? Even if there wasn\u2019t enmity between us and them, this old man would definitely stay behind to lend young noble Ling a hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt warmth in his heart and smiled, \u201cHowever, the scene may be a little bloody, this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d the white-robed scholar chuckled, \u201cCould it be that the few of us can\u2019t kill?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sighed and could only let them have their way.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, there were three more people to join in his feast and the two wild boar leg which he roasted wasn\u2019t enough. But if he were to find more ingredients from the corpse of the wild boar which he had thrown aside, it would seem a little rude as well. After all, that corpse was thrown away like it was rubbish to him.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian frowned and took out half an incense stick before walking into the forest. As Ye QingChen and the others looked at his action, they were also filled with bewilderment and could not understand what Ling Tian was doing. Li Xue, however, knew what Ling Tian wanted to do and could not help but chuckle. Of course, if it was the other person from Beyond Heavens, Justice, he would definitely be able to guess what Ling Tian was doing. After all, the two of them had fought with this incense stick before.</p><br/><p>After just a short while, Ling Tian had returned with a bag full of rewards. He held onto six to seven rainbow-colored venomous snakes and walked out of the forest. There were a few which had a triangular head and obviously looked extremely venomous.</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen and the white-robed scholar looked at each other wondering how Ling Tian was able to find so many venomous snakes in such a short period of time. Only the woodcutter dressed man took in a deep breath of cold air. He was different from the other two. After living in the depths of the mountains for a long time, he was extremely familiar with the different species of snakes. With a single look, he could tell that all of the snakes in Ling Tian\u2019s hands were extremely venomous.</p><br/><p>If an ordinary person were to be bitten by any one of these snakes, merely seeing blood and dying on the spot would be considered a simple outcome. It was very likely for their whole body to be reduced into a pile of bloody water. Furthermore, all of these snakes were extremely agile and they weaved through the forest like the wind. Even if he wanted to catch one of them, he would definitely have to put in a considerable amount of effort. However, the little gigolo in front of him had caught six to seven snakes in just a short period of time! He was indeed someone who had successfully escaped from the hands of Justice!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood stuff.\u201d A green divine light shot of the woodcutter\u2019s eyes like he was a starving wolf looking at a harmless rabbit. He was extremely familiar with how delicious all of these snakes were. The more venomous the snake was, the more delicious it was as well. There was once where he spent a great deal of effort to catch a few of these snakes and he could still clearly remember the intoxication up until now.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian burst out laughing and retrieved the snake\u2019s gall easily, handing one to each person present. He then skinned and deboned the snake after removing its innards. Following that, he took Ye QingChen\u2019s wine gourd and bathed the snake in aromatic wine before sprinkling it with seasoning. Piercing a clean wooden branch through it, he began roasting it over the flame.</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen\u2019s eyes widened as he grit his teeth with heartache. Snatching the wine gourd back, he hugged it in his embrace with a face full of bitterness.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian burst out laughing, \u201cOld brother Ye, your wine isn\u2019t anything special. Using it to wash the meat of the snake, I still find it a pity for this snake meat. Look at how heartbroken you are over it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen\u2019s face became taut, \u201cIsn\u2019t this all your fault? After drinking all of your exquisite wine such as Hero\u2019s Blood, Maiden\u2019s Heart, etc, how would I be able to even swallow the wine of the secular world? This wine is the famed \u2018Mouth of Intoxication\u2019 with a prolonged aftertaste. While it cannot be compared to your wine, it is also a world-famous wine and is extremely pricey. With this old man\u2019s limited wealth, how can I waste it like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was stunned for a moment before bursting out into laughter, \u201cSince it cannot be compared to my wine, how would it be considered a waste?!\u201d He then signaled to Li Xue.</p><br/><p>Li Xue smiled and stood up. Walking over to their horses, she untied two leather pouches and threw it over.</p><br/><p>Just when Ye QingChen was about to retort to what Ling Tian had said, he saw those two leather pouches and could smell a familiar aromatic fragrance. His eyes lit up and threw his wine gourd to the side. How could he still be bothered with the pricey Mouth of Intoxication? He quickly grabbed one of the leather pouches and laughed out in delight.</p><br/><p>The actions of the woodcutter were also extremely swift. He immediately snatched Ye QingChen\u2019s wine gourd as though he was afraid that Ye QingChen would snatch it back. Opening the gourd, he raised his head and began indulging in the wine. A long while later, the woodcutter finally shifted the wine gourd away for his lips as he laughed, \u201cGood wine indeed! How satisfying! It indeed lives up to its name of being a world-famous wine. It is truly delectable upon entry into the mouth and has a prolonged aftertaste! This is too d*mned satisfying!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen beamed, \u201cSince it is satisfying, this old man shall be generous for once. Woodcutter, why don\u2019t you finish the rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Ah\u2026 hahahaha\u2026 then I shall not stand on ceremony and will thank you for your gift.\u201d The woodcutter was overjoyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I am serious. Drink it all. Why don\u2019t you finish it all right now?\u201d Ye QingChen had a bright smile on his face. It is best if you drink so much now that you can\u2019t drink a single drop of liquor later. All of this fragrant wine will then become mine. Hahahaha.</p></div>\n</div>"}

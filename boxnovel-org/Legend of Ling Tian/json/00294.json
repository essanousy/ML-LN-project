The Heaven Splitter had already successfully gained the attention of the whole continent and would definitely cause chaos to break out. In their predictions, regardless of who obtains the Heaven Splitter, they would definitely stage an uprising in a year at the latest. The Xiao Family is definitely preparing for war upon their return. However, what they don\u2019t know is that the party that obtained the Heaven Splitter is one which no one in the continent would dare to provoke. Furthermore, that party is also the only power without any ambitions to conquer the continent. However, this is something that no one would be able to guess!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen nodded her head in response and said, \u201cHowever, it is a pity to let Xiao FengYang leave like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then said with a smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s the pity? If we let them go, the Xiao Family will definitely remain silent for now. As long as the world doesn\u2019t break out into chaos, the Xiao Family won\u2019t make a move. However, chaos will definitely not break out anytime soon. This change is something that is definitely out of the Xiao Family\u2019s calculations. Thus, we have unknowingly won ourselves more time.\u201d Ling Tian chuckled before continuing, \u201cIf the Heaven Splitter really had been obtained by another party, I would have definitely exhausted all my means to kill Xiao FengYang in Sky Bearing! While the Xiao Family\u2019s plans are extremely intricate and well thought out, they didn\u2019t include Beyond Heavens, the biggest wild card, into their calculations! With the addition of this change, things will be interesting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen came to a realization and she couldn\u2019t help but smile, \u201cThat\u2019s right, regardless of whether or not a power has the strength to conquer the continent, they would definitely have the ambition. However, the unbelievably powerful Beyond Heavens is able to seclude themselves from worldly affairs without the thought of conquering the continent. For the Heaven Splitter to land in the hands of Beyond Heavens, it is akin to having it disappear from the world. As such, the Xiao Family\u2019s plans of using the Heaven Splitter to incite a war have been completely foiled. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed out loud, \u201cThat\u2019s right! The Xiao Family would definitely wait for the party with the Heaven Splitter to stage an uprising so that they can gain the benefits when the continent breaks out into chaos. While their plan was a good one, they just couldn\u2019t predict the future! The Xiao Family\u2019s plan will definitely be foiled. Furthermore, if Beyond Heavens were to think that the Xiao Family was the mastermind for inciting chaos in the continent, the Xiao Family would certainly be in trouble!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen replied with a giggle, \u201cThen, the Xiao Family would be waiting for nothing or perhaps for calamity to befall upon them?\u201d</p><br/><p>A slight smile could be seen on Ling Tian\u2019s face as he looked out of the window, \u201cThat\u2019s right, by the time the Xiao Family comes to that realization, it would probably be a year later. At that time, Xiao FengHan would realize that the state of the world was far different from what it is now! The Ling Tian of that time will also not be the present Ling Tian! While a year isn\u2019t a long time, it is enough for me to lay out my plans!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Xiao FengYang can\u2019t die!\u201d Ling Tian concluded, \u201cNot only must he be alive, we must pray for him to arrive back at the Xiao Family safely, lest the Xiao Family get anxious and start the war early. After all, we were the ones who received the most from the auction. Not only did we receive the Millennium Warm Jade and Ice Fire Lotus, we even exterminated the bulk of Water of Heavenly Wind in the continent and captured Shui QianRou. At the same time, we have also wiped out the XiMen Family and gained the time which we lacked the most! If we don\u2019t let others return home safely after receiving so many benefits, I wouldn\u2019t be able to face my conscience. Right, Chen\u2019er?\u201d As he said that, he revealed a mischievous smile.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s face turned red and she also burst out laughing. At the same time, she couldn\u2019t help but feel pity for the Xiao Family. After such detailed planning and great foresight, their plan was completely foiled and even benefited others! Furthermore, they were still kept in the dark and celebrating their success.</p><br/><p>The brightest one is still my young noble!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian suddenly stopped smiling and asked, \u201cChen\u2019er, how is your improvement?\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of excitement could be seen on Ling Chen\u2019s face as she said jubilantly, \u201cYoung noble, the Great Cyclic Pellet which you had refined is a divine medicine indeed! Chen\u2019er didn\u2019t meet any danger when consuming the pill. All I did was to use my cold inner qi to continually refine the medicinal effects of the pill. In the end, not only was my inner qi much purer than before, I had successfully broken through to the seventh stage and entered the mid-seventh stage. The pill is just too amazing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Err! Ling Tian\u2019s mouth was wide open in shock.</p><br/><p>The top grade Great Cyclic Pellet which Ling Tian had refined was without a doubt extremely effective and even Ling Tian had tried it out himself. However, he definitely didn\u2019t have such an unusual improvement like Ling Chen. Thinking about how he had to undergo a torturous process to absorb the medicinal effects of the pellet, and looking at how Ling Chen was able to absorb it so easily as though it was something insignificant, Ling Tian had a sudden urge to bang his head on the wall!</p><br/><p>The mid-seventh stage of the Divine Ice Formula?! It seems that Ling Chen was only at the fifth stage originally! To think that a single Great Cyclic Pellet was able to help her cross two stages! Ling Tian was completely speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch quick improvement?\u201d Ling Tian suddenly thought of something and couldn\u2019t help but become anxious. Quickly placing his finger on Ling Chen\u2019s wrist, he sent out a wave of inner qi into Ling Chen\u2019s meridians. However, he was shocked to realize that the flow in all her meridians was incomparably smooth with her inner qi gentle, dense and pure. There wasn\u2019t a single oddity in her meridians, and Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in shock.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen then smiled, \u201cAt the start, I felt as though the medicinal effect of the Great Cyclic Pellet was extremely violent but it became gentle and smooth after a full circulation in my meridians. Furthermore, when I hung the Millennium Warm Jade which young noble gave me on my chest, I felt as though it was continuously sending out waves of warm energy into my meridians. The originally violent energy then became much calmer and gentler. It is really so amazing, hehehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Millennium Warm Jade! Ling Tian suddenly thought of this item! No wonder Ling Chen\u2019s improvement was so stunning! With the Millennium Warm Jade protecting her, she wouldn\u2019t need to worry about entering into cultivation deviation and could focus fully on absorbing the medicinal effects of the pill. How could her improvement be slow? Furthermore, she has the pure Yin physique and is cultivating the Divine Ice Formula. Upon being mixed with the pure Yang Great Cyclic Pellet, she would naturally achieve twice the results with half the effort. After which, breaking through into the seventh stage of the Divine Ice Formula was no more than nature taking its course. Ling Chen was originally at the peak of the fifth stage and a single step away from the sixth stage. With the aid of the top grade Great Cyclic Pellet and Millennium Warm Jade, she was actually able to break through into the seventh stage! This was definitely something unexpected.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Ling Tian nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen then said excitedly, \u201cYoung noble, this Great Cyclic Pellet is really useful. If I take a few more of them, will I breakthrough into the ninth stage directly and enter the highest stage of the Divine Ice Formula?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was startled as he reprimanded, \u201cYou must not have such a thought! The Great Cyclic Pellet is something which goes against the heavens and goes against the logic of inner qi growing by slow accumulation. Such a quick improvement is already something that shouldn\u2019t happen and would be harmful to your meridians. If you were to take another pellet, you would suffer a backlash on the spot and die from all your meridians rupturing! This is no joke! With your improvement, you can only take the second pill five years later! Furthermore, this is conditional on whether or not your improvement in these five years is satisfactory. Even if you can take a second pill, the effects of the pill would definitely be greatly diminished. If I were to have a say, I wouldn\u2019t want to you to consume another pill. After all, an external source of strength isn\u2019t the right path!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s eyes widened in shock as she patted her chest with fear, \u201cAh? So that\u2019s the case? Thankfully I only ate a single pill. I originally still intended to consume two pills. Mmm, I will listen to young noble and work hard in my cultivation. I will not rely on such divine pills!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian began perspiring as he thought, Does this lass think that this is a candy? My goodness! If this lass really consumed two pills, I would probably be greeted with a pile of ashes upon my return! Then, Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but pull Ling Chen into his embrace. With a shriek, Ling Chen was already placed on Ling Tian\u2019s knees. With two loud slapping sounds, Ling Tian began spanking her behind.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen cried out in pain but her eyes were filled with joy.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian said with a \u2018hmph\u2019, \u201cLet me teach you a lesson! How can you be so naughty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen leaned on his knees and raised her head out, \u201cDidn\u2019t young noble want to assess my improvements? Why not let Chen\u2019er exchange a few moves with young noble? It\u2019s been a long while since Chen\u2019er had a spar with young noble.\u201d With a large improvement in her inner qi, she was itching to have a spar.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then gave a lecherous smile as his hands were already under her shirt. Grabbing on two her twin peaks, he grunted, \u201cYou can spar with Ling Jian tomorrow. Today, we have other more important things to do. See how this young noble makes you submit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s face was completely red as she struggled to get up. However, she was quickly pressed down by Ling Tian and had no choice but to shut her eyes as she felt a wave of pleasure rising from her chest. With a moan, she said, \u201cYoung noble, it is still in the day!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then carried her up and walked towards the room with a chuckle, \u201cSo what if it\u2019s in the day? Who says we can\u2019t do it in the day?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a shriek, she plunged her face into Ling Tian\u2019s chest and stopped struggling. Like a docile cat, she allowed Ling Tian to carry her into the room.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was first ignited by Shui QianRou first and Yu BingYan next. However, he had no way to let out his lust and could only hold himself back. Then, Xiao YanXue came to bid her farewells which frustrated him even more as he almost wanted to let out a roar to the skies. Now that he had a chance, why would he care about the day or night? He immediately sought Ling Chen to have a good \u2018confirmation\u2019!</p><br/><p>The sound of the both of them talking could then be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, can I beat Ling Jian tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I must definitely teach him a good lesson tomorrow! I must definitely beat him up black and blue. Hmph, hmph\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026up to you, the fiercer the better.\u201d As though he was busy with something Ling Tian\u2019s words weren\u2019t very clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, then can I\u2026\u201d Ling Chen continued chattering on.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep quiet!\u201d Ling Tian finally cried out in exasperation and thought, This foolish lady really knows how to spoil the mood!</p><br/><p>\u201cOka\u2026err\u2026ooo\u2026\u201d It was as though her mouth was covered with something and the room became silent\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

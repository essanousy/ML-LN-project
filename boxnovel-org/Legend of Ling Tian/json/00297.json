In order to achieve some accomplishments, how could one be picky about what they do? The victors are glorified, and losers vilified, what more can I say? Your father Ling Xiao is a great general, with half his life as a soldier, he should have long ago made the preparations to die in battle. When two countries war, it\u2019s every man for himself. To be completely unscrupulous, what wrong is there in that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian coldly snorted, \u201cSo, to you people, what you did was ultimately correct. But if you stand in my viewpoint?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen two countries go to war, it\u2019s every man for himself. When people fight for accomplishments, the winners are glorified and losers vilified!\u201d Ling Tian recited. \u201cIndeed, under this pretense, anything done can\u2019t be counted as wrong. Miss Shui, is it not like that? Do you really think that\u2019s the case? Is this the behavior of a monarch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou sneered at him, \u201cTo think that young noble Ling has finally achieved enlightenment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian ignored her jibe and instead continued to speak, \u201cAs enemies on opposing sides, based on what Miss Shui said, does it mean that anything and everything should be done to win? Since we chose to be enemies, then should we accept it and go all out? Is this what Miss Shui wants to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou coldly ridiculed, \u201cYou\u2019re not too foolish after all! I\u2019ve said it, just as the celestial bodies never run out of energy, we should always strive to better ourselves. This is the way of a monarch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed out loudly, suddenly withdrawing his smile as his face become cold. \u201cGood. What a good saying, just as the celestial bodies never run out of energy, we should always strive to better ourselves! In that case, let me ask Miss Shui, are we now enemies?\u201d</p><br/><p>She snapped back, \u201cIf we aren\u2019t, then why would this lady be here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian clapped his hands, leisurely continuing, \u201cThen since we\u2019re enemies, why can\u2019t I scold you? Since you can even kill me, do I need a reason to scold you? Whatever you do is the way of a monarch, so why can\u2019t I remain noble if I scold you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou was stunned silly!</p><br/><p>A cruel smile now surfaced on Ling Tian\u2019s face, \u201cBased on your logic, anything I want to do is permissible! Are you prepared to actually be my slave? Or a toy to be played with and discarded? Can I actually throw you into the barracks to be the prostitute for the military? To sate my soldiers\u2019 lust? Have you had this mental preparation? Since you\u2019re a nobility that understands this concept. Is that it?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s face immediately paled! No one knew if it was because of anger or\u2026 fear! This young woman\u2019s heart definitely was in a panic right now.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian coldly snorted, ruthlessly pressing on, \u201cSince you\u2019ve already made ample preparations, then if I don\u2019t do as you wish, then wouldn\u2019t I be seen as too friendly? Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have any of that regal bearing!\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned around, hollering, \u201cMen!\u201d</p><br/><p>From outside came sounds of assent, and Ling Tian commanded, \u201cStrip this Shui Family\u2019s Miss of her clothes, and throw her into the military barracks! Tell the brothers that they are to enjoy themselves to the fullest, as per the request of the successor of Water of Heavenly Wind! This person has long ago prepared herself for such a matter, and we definitely must live up to her expectations!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group agreed, and four big men rushed forward!</p><br/><p>\u201cNOOO!\u201d Shui QianRou screamed out mournfully! It was a plaintive lament, full of sadness. What color that was left on her face bled out immediately, as two streams of tears rolled down her cheeks!</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian! No, young noble Ling, I beg you, please let my family\u2019s young princess go!\u201d Die\u2019er immediately kneeled down on the floor, kowtowing to him, \u201cMy young miss\u2019s body is after all worth its weight in gold, how could it be defiled like so? On account of the feelings our little princess has towards you, please let her go! I beg you! I beg you! I beg you! \u2026\u201d Die\u2019er kept knocking her head on the floor, to the point that her forehead was profusely bleeding. On the floor, a bloody patch had already formed!</p><br/><p>\u201cWorth its weight in gold?\u201d Ling Tian sneered, \u201cBut we\u2019re enemies after all, and what is a noble body worth to me? Hurry up! Drag her out!\u201d Shui QianRou\u2019s face was already ashen, looking like a corpse! For someone of her status, to speak nothing of having those crude boors defile her, even touching her would be a humiliation! If she was really bestowed to Ling Tian\u2019s troops as a prize, then she would rather die! She had already formed the intention to commit suicide in her heart!</p><br/><p>In the end, Ling Chen was still a lady and couldn\u2019t take it anymore. She tugged on Ling Tian\u2019s sleeve, softly whispering, \u201cYoung noble\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian, however, furiously hollered at her, \u201cShut your mouth! When a man is doing his business, as his partner, you don\u2019t have the rights to interrupt! Stand at the side!\u201d His voice was cold and ruthless, with no room for argument!</p><br/><p>The rims of Ling Chen\u2019s eyes immediately reddened, as the tears threatened to fall. She could only aggrievedly stand beside the wall, not daring to even speak another word. This was the first time Ling Tian had ever rebuked Ling Chen so loudly and viciously, so how could she not feel heartbroken?</p><br/><p>The four of the guards looked at each other, feeling that the situation was incredibly awkward, and hesitated.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was apoplectic with rage and sent a kick to one of the guards as he shouted, \u201cAre you guys deaf?! This noble here has already given his orders, didn\u2019t you guys hear me? Hurry up and entertain this Miss Shui, unless you tell me you want this young noble to do it myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard who got kicked was smashed heavily on the stone wall and even rebounded back. An intense look of pain appeared on his face, yet he dared not even let out a sound of pain. However, sweat poured profusely down his face as he endured it!</p><br/><p>Seeing the four guards step ever closer, Die\u2019er lost her head out of fear. She quickly crawled back up, and stood in front of Shui QianRou, pleading in a low voice, \u201cMiss, under someone else\u2019s eaves, you have to lower your head; hurry and beg young noble Ling! If you ask him yourself, he might change his mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou had a bloodless complexion, despair evident in her eyes. \u201cNo! I\u2019d rather die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately took the chance, \u201cDie? Do you think you still can choose to die now? Do you think that by dying you\u2019ll escape all this? Shui QianRou, you\u2019re too naive!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDang!\u201d Ling Tian drew out one of the blades on the waist of the guards, and threw it beside Qian ShuiRou, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll give you this sword. Do you dare to commit suicide now? Hmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou stretched out her hand and placed the blade on her fair neck. In a severe yet mournful voice, she screamed, \u201cLing Tian! I\u2019ll die for you to see!\u201d As she spoke, she lifted up the blade to chop at her neck!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian jeered, \u201cGo ahead! After you die, I\u2019ll strip your body naked, and while it still has human warmth, give it to every soldier to sate themselves! After they\u2019re done, then I\u2019ll freeze your body and expressly deliver it back to Heavenly Wind Continent to parade around. I\u2019ll let everyone all over the world have a feast for their eyes and allow the world to see what the millennium-old Shui family is like! I believe, the name of Miss Shui, from Water of Heavenly Wind, will go down in history, to be passed down across all ages!</p><br/><p>\u201cDang lang!\u201d The steel blade dropped onto the floor as Shui QianRou pounced on Ling Tian, grabbing hold of his lapels. \u201cLing Tian! You\u2019re not human! As nobility, how could you treat me as such? You devil! You\u2019re a b*st*rd dog who\u2019s worse than a beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian however remained unmoved, as though nothing out of the ordinary had happened. He only coldly replied, \u201cIsn\u2019t this Miss Shui\u2019s life motto? This young noble here is just following your thought process. Since we\u2019re enemies, then of course I can be as unscrupulous as I want! This is nothing more than what I\u2019ve just learned from Miss Shui!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou slowly let go of Ling Tian\u2019s lapels, her whole body falling onto the floor as she started bawling. How could such a young girl like her take such psychological torment?</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble Ling, what do we have to do in order for you to let go of my family\u2019s miss?\u201d Die\u2019er kneeled on the floor once again, with tear tracks all over her cheeks, and her forehead matted with blood, looking like a malicious spirit.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian snorted, \u201cWho are you to ask me! Your Family\u2019s Miss clearly knows what to do! And she also knows what I want!\u201d Ling Tian turned his head to face Shui QianRou, his voice suddenly becoming gentle, \u201cGreat Miss Shui, are you planning to have the reputation of your family to be as smelly as the XiMen house for the next millennium or so? Or are you going to tell me about your detailed plans? How are you going to deal with my father? Where did this scheme originate from? Who is participating in it? So long as you spill the beans, I can save my father, and your Shui Family can be spared this humiliation. It\u2019s a win-win! Even if the scheme doesn\u2019t succeed, your people might not die! However, if you don\u2019t speak, while you can\u2019t avoid your fate, my father still might not die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian continued, \u201cI spared no effort to kill the two Yu Family elders, so as to bring you back. I don\u2019t have time to dawdle! Right now, my patience is wearing thin, so I\u2019ll count to three. Shui QianRou, if I don\u2019t receive the answer I want, then I\u2019ll immediately rush through dawn and dusk to the North to save my father. And you can obediently accept your fate as a slut!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian did not even hesitate, immediately counting, \u201cOne!\u201d</p><br/><p>A tremor passed through Shui QianRou\u2019s body, and myriad expressions flashed through her eyes, but her lips only trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo!\u201d Ling Tian did not pause, immediately shouting out the next number.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou bit her lips, drawing blood. Her body trembled uncontrollably, and the tears kept falling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha,\u201d Ling Tian laughed out, \u201cSeems like Miss Shui doesn\u2019t want to say. Then I need not waste my time on counting down. Come, men, drag her out!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!!!\u201d Shui QianRou raised her head up in panic, her defenses entirely crumbling! With a voice as soft as mosquito buzz, she spoke, \u201cI\u2026. I\u2019ll say\u2026.\u201d But she suddenly swayed and fell into a dead faint. She was originally already inflicted with heavy injuries, and now that her psyche had been broken by Ling Tian, there was nothing left to support her, and she collapsed! The moment she dropped, her breath became shallow, as though she was about to die!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face turned grave as he took a step forward, grabbing onto her wrist. Exercising his inner qi, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh, the wounds of this lass were unexpectedly heavier than what he had thought! He immediately commanded, \u201cSummon the doctor to treat her. The moment she wakes up, report to me, regardless of the time.\u201d After he had finished, he walked out, and the four guards followed, standing uniformly outside. Ling Tian suddenly stopped and patting the shoulder of the guard whom he had kicked previously, apologizing with a genial tone, \u201cBrother, thank you for your hard work. In order to get what I wanted, I had to do so. Does it still hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>A warm current of inner qi flowed as he patted the guard, seeping into his body and alleviating the pain immediately, before removing all present injuries.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

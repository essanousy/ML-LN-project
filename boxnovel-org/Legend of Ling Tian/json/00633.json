She was angered to the point she could not even say a thing! Too much! He is going too far!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you dare?\u201d Ling Tian chuckled and provoked her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy won\u2019t I dare to? It\u2019s a deal! If you lose, will you listen to whatever I say?\u201d Shui QianRou said fiercely.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course! Even if you ask me to eat mud, I will listen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gamble!\u201d Shui QianRou agreed as she thought about the different ways to teach this horrible fellow in front of her a lesson after winning the bet. All of a sudden, a smirk could be seen on her face. Ling Tian, I am going to teach you a lesson for underestimating this young miss!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had a delighted smile on his face. Do you really think that I can\u2019t take care of you? You must be dreaming! I heard that the emperors of the previous generations have the authority to rename rivers and oceans\u2026 hahaha\u2026</p><br/><p>Watching the slow flowing river water with a frown, Ling Tian asked, \u201cHow long more would it take before we can reach Heavenly Wind? With this speed of ours and the distance between both the continents, it would take quite some time right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou raised her head and looked at the sails before revealing a satisfied smile, \u201cIt won\u2019t be too long. As long as the wind direction doesn\u2019t change, we would only need ten days to reach the Shui Family pier in Heavenly Wind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTen days?\u201d Ling Tian was baffled, \u201cWe actually need such a long time? This isn\u2019t considered long?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had not went out to sea before, or more accurately, he had never went out to sea on such a backward boat. In his previous life, even if one wanted to travel half the Earth, a few days would be sufficient. But in this generation where transport was still undeveloped, their journey would definitely take a much longer time!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou smiled and put her fringe behind her ears. Her actions were gentle and beautiful with a tinge of pride, \u201cThis is already considered extremely fast. If not for our special Shui Family ship, an ordinary ship would require at least twice the time! Of course, if the heavens help us and send a strong gust of north-east wind, the time taken would be reduced by one to two days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Special Shui Family ship? A tortoise like this? Ling Tian rolled his eyes and said, \u201cWhat if the wind blows in the south-west direction? Would that mean that we will end up in Heavenly Star?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou covered her mouth and burst out laughing, \u201cYou really don\u2019t understand anything. I was still wondering if there is anything in the world that young noble Ling is ignorant of!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled. He was truly ignorant in this aspect. Since when would he ride such a backward boat in his previous life? Such a boat would have been sent to a museum already and everyone would only fly wherever they went. Only during a holiday would they take a cruise and enjoy on the sea. However, young noble Ling would not have such a luxury or opportunity in his previous life.</p><br/><p>\u201cA waterwheel is located at the bottom of the boat. Silly fellow.\u201d Shui QianRou was extremely satisfied at the opportunity to see Ling Tian stumped, \u201cHow about it?! Young noble Ling\u2019s sights must have been widened right? The waterwheel of our Shui Family was made specially and is definitely the fastest of its kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not a celestial, how can I know everything?\u201d Ling Tian smiled bitterly. Such a boat and such a speed can actually be considered the fastest of its kind?! It can only travel sixty miles in two hours and you really treat it as some high tech boat?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen we arrive at Heavenly Wind, are you going to follow me, or\u2026\u201d Shui QianRou grit her teeth and drew circles with her feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter reaching land, we will have to split up for a while. However, I will definitely rush over by 3rd March to witness the battle between the elites of both families.\u201d Ling Tian said with a smile.</p><br/><p>3rd March, Mount Vacant; gathering of tigers and dragon, heavens and earth overturned! This is the tradition of a thousand years! Every sixty years, the two families would gather on 3rd March for a battle between dragons and tigers.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d As Shui QianRou calculated the dates, it was 1st Feburary today and after ten days of travel, they would only part for 20 plus days. She immediately felt a sense of sourness in her heart. After being used to spending everyday together with Ling Tian, she was not willing to part with her beloved one.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring this generational battle, which family do you wish to win? Just what is your plan?\u201d Shui QianRou changed the topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not my wish but the truth is before our eyes.\u201d Ling Tian sighed and looked at her with a trace of pity. \u201cComparing the strength of both your families, your Shui Family will lose for sure without the slightest chance of victory! What you should be considering now is how you should lose. You should be considering how you can preserve the descendants of your faction while sacrificing the pillars of your uncles. This would also help you to achieve the upperhand in future as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou lowered her head depressedly. While she was already prepared for such an outcome, she still felt a tinge of bitterness in her heart. After all, the reputation of her family would be harmed and as the daughter of the Shui Family, she naturally didn\u2019t feel good.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any meaning to the victory of a so called \u2018generational battle\u2019! If the Shui Family emerges victorious, it would only speed up the death of of your Shui Family.\u201d Ling Tian glared at her, \u201cShui WuBo and the others would definitely send out all of their experts in the generational battle to attain the best possible result so that they can suppress your factions with merits. With their outstanding merits, they would be able to suppress your faction and attain victory in this factional battle. At that time, it would be time for a change in leader for your Shui Family. This would be an unchangeable truth at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou let out a long sigh and the two of them stared at the river for a long time without saying a thing.</p><br/><p>Three days later, the boats of the Yu Family also entered the ocean.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Beyond Heavens\u2019 boat carried four individuals and entered the ocean stealthily.</p><br/><p>On the other side of the ocean in a rocky pier, the Shui Family members had already began setting up their defences.</p><br/><p>As the troops of the Shui Family gathered at the pier, the irrevelant people tactfully took their leave. The number three character of the Shui Family, Shui ManCheng, walked out of the carriage with a solemn expression. As he looked at the ocean before him, his eyes were filled with anger and resentment.</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng was the father of Shui QianJiang. During his trip to Heavenly Star, Shui QianJiang lost his life in a foreign land. For Shui ManCheng to take the initiative to lead the soldiers over, who knows what he was thinking about.</p><br/><p>Why couldn\u2019t the one who died by Shui QianRou or Shui QianHuan?! Why must it be my son?! Why would that darn Beyond Heavens be willing to save Shui QianHuan but not my son! Shui ManCheng cried out in his heart countless of times. As time went by, he sank deeper and deeper into his anger and hatred. Since my son is dead, all of you should not think about leading a good life either! Regardless of who you are, I will ensure that you pay a heavy price!</p><br/><p>Another wave of commotion could be heard and another carriage arrived. A feminene voice then sounded, \u201cI was wondering who it was. It turns out to be third uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng looked at the teen in front of him and forced out a smile, \u201cSo it is nephew HuangFu who has arrived. I wonder what nephew is here for?\u201d</p><br/><p>The young teen\u2019s face was slightly pale and his eyes drowsy as though he was drunk. With a smile, he said, \u201cI heard that younger sister Rou is coming back and I am here to receive her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng snorted and was extremely frustrated.</p><br/><p>This young teen was the young noble of the HuangFu Family, the second largest aristocratic family in Heavenly Wind only second to their Shui Family. His name was HuangFu Jun and after a chance encounter with Shui QianRou three years ago, he stuck onto Shui QianRou shamelessly and resorted to every possible mean he had up his sleeves to gain Shui QianRou\u2019s favor. He swore that he would return with the beauty in his arms and his actions fustrated Shui QianRou greatly.</p><br/><p>While the HuangFu Family had the title of an aristocratic family, they did not have the history of one. The HuangFu Family had only existed for a hundred plus years and with the HuangFu Family\u2019s fame, even the direct descendants of the family would not have the rights to even think about marrying the treasured daughter of the Shui Family Head. However, the sudden changes in the Shui Family over the past few years had greatly damaged the standing of the Shui Family in Heavenly Wind. Thus, even if the strength of the HuangFu Family couldn\u2019t be compared to the Shui Family, they could not be underestimated. Witnessing the internal struggles and external problems of the Shui Family, if Shui QianRou was married to HuangFu Jun in return for the support of the HuangFu Family, the HuangFu Family would provide a huge boost to the strength of the Family Head\u2019s faction. Together with the fact that HuangFu Jun could be considered to be a young and talented individual, Shui ManKong was willing to approve the marriage.</p><br/><p>If not for the upcoming battle with the Yu Family, Shui QianRou would probably be planning her marriage the moment she returned to Heavenly Wind!</p><br/><p>Of course, Shui ManCheng\u2019s faction would not willingly allow the strength of the Family Head\u2019s faction to be strengthened and opposed vehemently to the marriage. Now that their faction was about to gain the upperhand, how would they be willing to allow the HuangFu Family to interfere in the Shui Family affairs? Thus, Shui ManCheng and HuangFu Jun would naturally not be friendly with each other.</p><br/><p>The two of them stood side by side with a fake smile on their faces as though they were extremely close to each other as they looked at the vast ocean.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the sound of galloping horses could be heard again and a troop of over a thousand men came from afar with their destination being the pier.</p><br/><p>Could there be a third party? Which force did this party belong to?</p><br/><p>A sharp whistle sounded and the sprinting horses stopped immediately, filling the place with silence. A powerful aura swept past the pier and everyone who was at the pier could not help but be taken aback. How disciplined! How could such troops be an unknown force?</p><br/><p>Before the dust could settle, a loud roar sounded, \u201cThe Sky Alliance is here for business! Everyone in front of us are to give way immediately. None of you are to move without orders. Those who defy my orders shall be killed without mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were actually from the Sky Alliance!</p><br/><p>They were actually the most frightening bandit organization in the Heavenly Wind Continent: the Sky Alliance! However, the Shui Family forces were here today to receive their own troops but what were the members of the Sky Alliance doing here?</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng shouted out, \u201cI am Shui ManCheng from the Shui Family. I wonder which Hall Master from the Sky Alliance is here today?\u201d His voice echoed out with prestige, fully displaying his profound inner qi.</p><br/><p>The Sky Alliance would usually send out their nine Hall Masters for business and there were only a few individuals in the world who knew the existence of the three leaders. However, no one had ever seen these three leaders before and they were extremely mysterious characters on the continent. Shui ManCheng would naturally ask for which Hall Master had arrived and not which leader.</p><br/><p>After a long pause, a deep and firm voice sounded, \u201cSo it is Third Master Shui. I am Tian ZhiYi.\u201d His voice spread out afar and the might of his voice was even above that of Shui ManCheng.</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>What an entrance!</p><br/><p>The most mysterious leader of the Sky Alliance had actually made a personal appearance!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

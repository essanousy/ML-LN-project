Having pushed his movement techniques to such an extreme, his face was already a pale white as a result of overexertion. If he didn\u2019t recuperate immediately, not only might he fail to obtain any information, but he would even risk being found out because of his heavy breathing!</p><br/><p>It was only after silently revolving his energy through a major cycle that Ling Jian then gently placed his ear on the roof tile below him!</p><br/><p>A soft voice sounded from below him.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 Today, the reason for gathering all of you here is because I have a matter I wish to discuss.\u201d A cultured and refined voice sounded, \u201cLing Tian has traveled north all the way from Western Han. Yesterday, about thirty kilometers from our city, he butchered sixteen first-rate experts from the Blood Slaughter Pavilion, causing them to all retreat. He is likely to be within Bright Jade City at this time, so I have called all of you here to come out with an idea or strategy to deal with him!\u201d</p><br/><p>From below came the collective sound of deep breaths. A first-rate assassin from the Blood Slaughter Pavilion! All of them knew what that meant and what they represented, but to think that they were annihilated in one fell swoop by him, and probably without even leaving a scratch on him! Didn\u2019t that mean that Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts had already reached an unfathomable stage? How could they deal with such a character? Who had the ability?!</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Ling Tian might not dare to openly show his face in Bright Jade City and would likely be disguised.\u201d After a moment of silence, a more aged voice sounded, \u201cIf we can find Ling Tian before he discovers us spying on him, then we have absolute confidence that we can behead and kill him in Bright Jade City. Once he dies, then it will be a cause for celebration!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the words were spoken, the rest of them rolled their eyes. This old fogey\u2019s words made sense, but were also 100% bullsh*t! Right now, weren\u2019t the most headache-inducing parts about what disguise Ling Tian had used to enter Bright Jade City, and where he was at? If they already knew that, then why did the Family Head need them to come here and discuss this? He would just need to go out and kill him!</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head, this old one has a dumb idea, but who knows? It might actually be able to lure Ling Tian out.\u201d That aged voice continued on at the same speed and tone. \u201cStarting from tomorrow, we can shut the four doors of the city and immediately send out our troops to search every house. First, this will ease the anxiety that the citizens feel regarding the recent assassinations from the First Pavilion, and second, the Shui Family is sure to have sent a group of people over here to Bright Jade City in order to take advantage of the chaos to scheme. We can use this chance to capture the lot of them. Lastly, and also the most important, we can use the excuse of capturing the rebel party to search for Ling Tian.\u201d He paused to cough, before continuing, \u201cIn name, we\u2019re still considered as in-laws to the Ling Family, and thus even if we want to make a move against Ling Tian, we still have to find an excuse to arrest him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the effectiveness is not too high with this plan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head, a dumb idea has its benefits. We can use this chance to place all of the foreigners with unknown statuses under our control! Or, to ensnare everyone! If Ling Tian is within this group of people, he naturally will retaliate. Then we can take this chance to simply finish him off!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that inappropriate? If we do it that way, wouldn\u2019t it attract hatred from everyone? Even if we do it under the pretext of settling the citizen\u2019s hearts, the gains don\u2019t justify our losses. Slaughtering innocents, is that what a person who aims to reach the top should do?\u201d another leader countered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is not so, let\u2019s not talk about achieving the top, unbothered about the little trifles. We definitely can\u2019t allow ourselves to be soft-hearted. Furthermore, ever since a few days ago, the First Pavilion has already begun their series of assassinations, causing the entire Bright Jade City to be on edge. Even now, we\u2019re suffering from the repercussions, and our internal problems are becoming more and more critical. As for the officials that we put in as replacements, they\u2019ve all been exposed to be lackeys under the Shui Family. While our own cleansing has not begun, the effects are actually similar to my plan. Thus, our priority now is to immediately draw up the plan for our own cleansing! Clear out all the spies, causing Bright Jade to plunge into chaos once again! When that time comes, then we deploy our troops, locking down the place under the name of preserving order, and capture all those \u2018murderers\u2019. Even if we overdo it a little, it does not matter by then. Does everyone present understand this logic?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s voice was unbearably grating, bringing about a sense of irritation to those who heard it. His voice also carried a tone of treating human lives like grass, making those around him tremble even without it being cold. The old man followed up with two eerie chuckles before continuing, \u201cIf one wishes to rule at the top, they must use the hearts of the citizens. The hearts of the citizens can be used and should be used. If the citizens\u2019 hearts can\u2019t be used, then they must be incited. If neither method works, then they should be destroyed!\u201d</p><br/><p>A look of praise appeared on Yu ManLou\u2019s face. The hearts of the citizens should be used if available, incited and provoked if unavailable, and destroyed if unable to be used! This phrase coincided with his exact beliefs.</p><br/><p>The rest remained silent, and only the person who voiced his opinions earlier argued once again, \u201cIsn\u2019t it too overbearing to simply sacrifice everybody just like that? Even if it\u2019s for Ling Tian, it\u2019s not worth getting thousands to accompany him in death! If that\u2019s the case, then how different are we compared to those who willfully slaughter the innocent?\u201d</p><br/><p>The eerie voice rebutted at this point, \u201cPavilion Head Huang, you should know that so long as that punk Ling Tian doesn\u2019t die, he will become the biggest opponent fighting against our family for hegemony! When the time comes and we meet on the battlefield, even if we were to claim the victory in the end, how many lives would we have to pay for it? Yours might even be included in that number! During the battle between Northern Wei and Sky Bearing, Ling Tian charged alone on horseback into a 400,000 strong army, and in just a few seconds, he took up to 10,000 lives! How could we leave such a character alone? To have a few thousand people accompanying him to death would be an honor! Would you rather Ling Tian die or our entire Yu Family be sacrificed?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about going against Ling Tian, but those innocent citizens\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInnocent people who die for no reason at all are found everywhere! How could you lump such different matters together? Why do you not question the endless chaos and battles that happen continuously day after day, causing countless innocent citizens to be killed every year? Which of them aren\u2019t innocent? If one has to care about any and every random innocent, then why talk about establishing hegemony, unifying all? If those ignorant masses die for the sake of protecting my Yu Family, isn\u2019t that a good thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHead Deacon\u2019s words have meaning in them!\u201d Yu ManLou made the final decision at this point. \u201cIf one wishes to achieve something great, sacrificing a few ignorant peasants is acceptable, more so as compared to sacrificing my people. This matter is decided as such, there\u2019s no need to debate anymore. Come tomorrow, we\u2019ll begin the cleansing operation, and seal up the city in the night. We\u2019ll search the city and capture all suspicious targets. I would rather have killed the wrong person than to let a suspect go!\u201d</p><br/><p>After pausing a moment, he continued, \u201cThis time, Ling Tian didn\u2019t come alone to Bright City. Accompanying him is a mysterious young lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMysterious young lady?\u201d Everyone started having their speculations, for no one knew what sort of lady would then be able to live up to the tag of \u2018mysterious\u2019 in their Family Head\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian left Sky Bearing alone, but during this period of time, another lass suddenly appeared alongside him. She isn\u2019t too old, seeming around seventeen or eighteen, and her looks are exquisite, but her moves are ruthless. Out of the sixteen assassins from the Blood Slaughter Pavilion, this lass eliminated six of them on her own, and also without a single injury. Her strength is incomparably strong, and even if she is not at Ling Tian\u2019s level, there shouldn\u2019t be much of a difference. Both are first tier experts!\u201d Yu ManLou indifferently spoke.</p><br/><p>The crowd was tongue-tied yet again. While all of them could be considered supreme experts on the continent, not many would be confident of having the ability to deal with six first-tier experts, and even fewer being able to remain unscathed. To hear of a mere sixteen-year-old lass that could pull this off, everyone couldn\u2019t help but look shocked.</p><br/><p>Could it be that lass Chen is also here? On the rooftop, Ling Jian sunk into deep thought. However, having ruthless moves like what the Yu Family Head described does not fit her at all. But if that\u2019s not her, then what other lady could have such a strength? Even if it\u2019s lass Chen herself, she wouldn\u2019t be that strong, right?</p><br/><p>He suddenly heard Yu ManLou casually remarking, \u201cFrom the intelligence I\u2019ve received, her martial skills are extremely unique and strange. Every palm strike of hers was followed by chilling winds and snow, as though one was plunged in the middle of a winter solstice\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s indeed lass Chen, could her martial arts have taken a step forward once again?! Upon hearing the \u2018as though one was plunged in the middle of a winter solstice\u2019, Ling Jian immediately threw away all his doubts. However, due to the shock in his heart, he involuntarily shifted, pressing too hard on a piece of tile and causing it to slightly shift.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian groaned in despair immediately. With so many experts present below, especially with Yu ManLou\u2019s unfathomable cultivation, how could it escape their acute senses? Ling Jian made his decision in a split second, shooting out from his current position as he escaped. Right now, he didn\u2019t even care to be discreet, and immediately burst out with his full strength, his speed accelerating to his limits!</p><br/><p>Indeed!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong!</p><br/><p>\u201cChase after him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Loud and angry bellows sounded at the very instant that Ling Jian shot off, and the place he was originally lying down on was blasted apart by a palm strike from someone. This was followed by the sounds of robes lashing against the wind as dozens of shadows shot up from below, and begin to chase after Ling Jian!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s face sank, and on his chin, the three tufts of beard on his lower jaw trembled fiercely. He was already angered beyond belief!</p><br/><p>To think that all the elites of the Yu Family were discussing matters in the same place, but had an eavesdropper hiding above them! This was as good as slapping Yu ManLou on the face, an extreme humiliation!</p><br/><p>This person must not be allowed to leave the Yu Family!</p><br/><p>However, what sort of person would possess such insane movement techniques such that even under all the wary senses of the experts present, they managed to secretly and stealthily eavesdrop on them?! If not for his minute movement previously, the ambush could be said to have been perfect! Even in his anger, Yu ManLou was filled with a certain interest towards this person!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian resembled a black colored lightning bolt as he plowed straight towards the outer wall of the Yu Residence, 300 feet away!</p><br/><p>Behind him were at least ten others, hot on his heels!</p><br/><p>The bells in the entire Yu Family started to ring, and countless guards surged from all directions.</p><br/><p>A low voice resounded like the rumbling of thunder, \u201cRaise the Heaven Encompassing Net! All of the guards are to stand at the wall to intercept!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s heart sank!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s move immediately checkmated him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

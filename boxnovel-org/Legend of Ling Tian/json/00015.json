His bathrobe had also been taken off and was hanging on the headboard of the bed. Two layers of blanket were wrapped around Ling Tian\u2019s body tightly. Ling Tian\u2019s eyes gradually shut as his breathing became stable with a peaceful look on his face. Occasionally, his mouth twitched and he was obviously in a comfortable, deep sleep already.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, there was a creak and the door opened slightly. A delicate figure walked in as Ling Tian revealed a look of happiness with his eyes still shut. When this person had walked into the room, a warm feeling rose from his heart. This person was his mother, Chu Ting\u2019er.</p><br/><p>A thick velvet coat was draped over Chu Ting\u2019er\u2019s body and she revealed a prideful and satisfied smile of a mother. After she entered, she first closed the door gently, afraid that the chilly winds would enter and make her son catch a cold. She then walked towards the side of the bed softly and looked at the sweet face of her son sleeping soundly with a blessed smile.</p><br/><p>She stretched out her right hand and wanted to gently touch her son\u2019s cheek. But she suddenly thought of something and was afraid that her hand was too cold and quickly retracted her hand. Then, she stretched both her hands into the velvet coat and placed them by her own skin. Only after a while when she felt that her hands were warm enough did she take her hands out and gently touch her son\u2019s face with a smile of satisfaction and blessing.</p><br/><p>She sat down gently by her son\u2019s side and looked at her son\u2019s face silently with loving eyes. After she thought about something, she smiled gently and bent forward, kissing her son on the forehead. Then, she placed Ling Tian\u2019s right hand which was out of the blanket back into the blanket and arranged the blanket again. Only then did she stand up with reluctance and walk out softly.</p><br/><p>After the barely inaudible sound of a door closing, Chu Ting\u2019er disappeared from the room as a unique smell which belonged only to Chu Ting\u2019er lingered in the room. On the bed, Ling Tian opened his eyes glistening with tears silently.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could clearly feel every single action Chu Ting\u2019er had after she entered the room with his spiritual sense. When he saw how his mother was afraid of her hands being too cold and warming it up immediately, Ling Tian was extremely touched. At that moment, the word \u201cmother\u201d, which was so sacred to Ling Tian, completely merged together with Chu Ting\u2019er\u2019s appearance.</p><br/><p>In Ling Tian\u2019s mind, there was a subtle change as he began to feel a deep sense of belonging. It was as though he felt that he would not be lonely as long as his mother was beside him. He began to laugh.</p><br/><p>Early morning, and the snow had not stopped.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian wrapped himself tightly in the blanket, making him seem extremely fat. On his head was also a snow white cap with two rabbit-like ears on the top of his head and two pieces of red jade on his forehead.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was speechless; a 30-year-old man like him was wearing such a classic child\u2019s hat. This really made him feel like puking. However, in the eyes of others, it was a cute face hidden in a cute rabbit\u2019s hat, making the handsome Ling Tian look extremely cute.</p><br/><p>With Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts cultivation, he was basically capable of preventing the cold and heat from affecting him. Such a temperatures were essentially negligible to him. Even if he wore a thin robe, he was still be able to defend against the cold. But he still had to put on a show for his grandparents and parents, lest they nag at him all day.</p><br/><p>The moment the few old people saw Ling Tian wearing something a little thinner, they made a big fuss out of it. They even punished the maids who were in charge of taking care of Ling Tian. From that day on, Ling Tian had become obedient. Although Ling Tian felt extremely blessed because of all the care and concern his family showered him with, he had a huge headache when it came to their constant nagging!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was already pretty tall, around the height of a seven to eight-year-old child. His eyebrows were like swords, cutting down diagonally. Below them were a pair of deep black eyes and a sharp nose. His skin was extremely fair and looked even prettier than that of a little girl.</p><br/><p>After the servant maids cleaned Ling Tian\u2019s face, Ling Tian walked towards the study of his parents. After a few steps, the sound of a gust sounded from behind him. As Ling Tian turned to take a look, a large snowball was flying towards his face. A few bits of snow landed on his clothes, immediately turning it cold.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was puzzled: Who would dare to touch me, the treasure of the Ling family, in the Ling family mansion? He could not help but stop and turn around to take a look. The servant maids beside him were startled to the point their faces turned pale as they hurriedly guarded in front of Ling Tian and shouted, \u201cWho? Come out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following which, a giggle sounded as a little boy seven to eight years of age walked out from the bamboo forest by the side with a mischievous smile. Ling Tian then focused his hearing and heard a flurry of footsteps moving away from the bamboo forest. Ling Tian could not help but give a mysterious smile.</p><br/><p>The servant maids then heaved a sigh of relief and said with annoyance, \u201cSo it is young master Zhen. Young master Zhen is really mischievous, but this is the little young master. You must not do this again in the future. If the little young master were to be startled, this maid will not be able to bear the consequences.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then laughed and said, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, who is this little brother?\u201d At the same time, doubt rose from his heart, Young master Zhen? Who is he? This is the first time I have seen someone who dares to be so rude to me after five years!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then studied him carefully; despite the mischievous smile on his face, his lips were thin with a skinny face. While his face was full of smiles, his gaze was chilly. The way he looked at Ling Tian was just like a venomous snake looking at its prey. The gaze seemed to even contain a deep hatred! Ling Tian was shocked! Why would a child so young have such a deep hatred towards him?</p><br/><p>The servant maid who was leading the way then said respectfully, \u201cThis is little young master Ling Zhen, son of young master Ling Kong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Kong? Who is Ling Kong?\u201d Ling Tian continued asking with doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Qiu Yue, so this is young master Tian? I didn\u2019t know that young master Tian was so suave.\u201d That brat walked forward with a smile, \u201cMy father is Ling Kong, and you must be younger brother Tian right? You\u2019re really cute!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then snickered in his heart, Little brat, do you think you will be able to fight against me?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then pulled Ling Zhen\u2019s hands excitedly and said, \u201cYou are? Haha, I can have someone to play with me already. Where do you stay at?\u201d Ling Tian then thought to himself: The \u2018chance occurrence\u2019 which you guys set up today is probably to send this brat next to me right? Hahaha, then let me just follow what you guys have planned.</p><br/><p>Both the brats then began to talk to each other with the various intentions in their heart. As though Ling Tian could not bear with the cold, he trembled and said with a pale face, \u201cHow cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>A look of disdain quickly flashed past Ling Zhen\u2019s eyes, before Ling Zhen asked with concern, \u201cIf little brother Tian is cold, you should quickly follow sister Qiu Yue to aunt\u2019s place. We can play again when you\u2019re free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Yue then said with a smile, \u201cYoung master Zhen is so sensible. Young master Tian, let us go quickly. Old master and madam should be anxious from waiting already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian responded with a nod before saying with reluctance, \u201cAlright then. Bye bye, brother Zhen. I will find you later to play.\u201d He then turned to walk away, feeling a burning gaze down his back. Ling Tian\u2019s lips twitched and he smiled mysteriously.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao and Chu Ting\u2019er sat beside each other while Ling Tian sat opposite, finishing his last mouthful of congee. After Ling Tian stood up, Chu Ting\u2019er pulled him into her bosom and took out a napkin, wiping his mouth gently while scolding him laughingly, \u201cThis child, always not cleaning up his mouth after he finishes his meal. He is just like a little cat.\u201d Ling Tian leaned on his mother with a peaceful feeling rising from within him.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s face was full of smiles as he said, \u201cHelp Ling Tian to tidy up a little and we are going to find father. Father has been busy searching for a teacher for Ling Tian these past few days. He may have settled the matter already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er responded with an \u201coh\u201d before asking with interest, \u201cTeacher? I wonder which few scholars father has found?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao replied, \u201cI also do not know. But, for them to have obtained father\u2019s approval, it definitely cannot go wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Pride then filled Chu Ting\u2019er\u2019s face as she said, \u201cNo matter who the teacher is, our smart little Tian\u2019er will definitely be able to learn well, right?\u201d As she said that, she gently pinched Ling Tian\u2019s cheek.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed bitterly in his heart. Then, he thought of something and asked, \u201cMother, I saw a child called Ling Zhen on the way here. Who is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Zhen?\u201d Ling Xiao and Chu Ting\u2019er stared at each other for a moment. Then, Chu Ting\u2019er replied, \u201cHe is the only son of your second uncle, Ling Kong. These few years, he followed your second uncle to the northwest horse ranch. I believe your second uncle should be back already. Mmm, the both of you are around the same age and can play together in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond uncle? Doesn\u2019t grandfather only have a single son?\u201d Ling Tian asked in doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, you little brat. Your second uncle is an orphan who your grandfather adopted back then. When he grew up, your grandfather took him as a godson. After your mother gave birth to you, your second uncle was sent to the northwest by your grandfather. Calculating the years, it has already been five years\u2026 Time really flies. Your second uncle is very capable and you must be respectful to him when you see him later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Ling Tian lowered his head as a face which he had never forgotten appeared in his mind: The person who revealed a killing intent to him when he was a child. He then laughed to himself: Ling Kong? Hahaha, you\u2019re finally back? This is getting more and more interesting. The matters today were probably arranged by you as well right? Hahaha, since you put in so much effort to bring your son up so well, this young master will also play with the both of you happily. Hehe\u2026</p>\n</div>"}

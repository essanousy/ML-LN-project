He was certain that even if he fought Yu ManTian personally, he wouldn\u2019t be able to do much better than Ling Chi. In that instant, the competitive spirit in him was ignited and he was spurred to cultivate quickly so he wouldn\u2019t be overtaken by his brother.</p><br/><p>In just the blink of an eye, Ling Chi had actually circled around Yu ManTian a full 19 times! At the same time, Yu ManTian had also received a total of 57 attacks! However, the most amazing part was that their swords had never touched each other!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian was unable to find Ling Chi\u2019s sword with his own, while Ling Chi had intentionally avoided Yu ManTian\u2019s sword. Ling Chi knew that his cultivation was far from Yu ManTian\u2019s level and that any contact would only increase his exhaustion. Thus, he chose to adopt such a strategy!</p><br/><p>Ling Chi\u2019s strategy was no doubt the best approach. As Ling Tian looked at their intense battle, he praised him as he thought, To face an opponent like Yu ManTian, a powerful XianTian expert, Ling Chi\u2019s strategy is undoubtedly the most suitable! Dragging out the battle was the best method. As long as Ling Chi\u2019s inner qi can continue to keep up, and he can maintain such a speed, the first to lose his patience will definitely be Yu ManTian. The moment Yu ManTian loses his patience, that would be the best time to strike!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian still couldn\u2019t help but sigh in his heart. Ling Chi\u2019s inner qi was just far too shallow as compared to Yu ManTian. While his strategy was correct, his inner qi would never be able to last until Yu ManTian became impatient. Therefore, Ling Chi\u2019s loss was already determined! Despite that, this battle was still extremely beneficial to the other four. After all, Ling Chi had just displayed the best way to deal with an expert like Yu ManTian! This strategy was something that the other four of them hadn\u2019t managed to come up with.</p><br/><p>In retrospect, Ling Tian was just too young. Despite having experience from both his lifetimes, his accumulated knowledge and wisdom was still limited. He had still underestimated Yu ManTian. Yu ManTian wasn\u2019t the arrogant and conceited NanGong TianHu. While he was an extremely straightforward person, he was also a martial arts fanatic who had been through hundreds of battles. After stepping into the XianTian stage, his martial arts attainment had far exceeded others. While he was usually a careless and rash individual, this didn\u2019t include how he would act in a martial arts spar!</p><br/><p>He was certain that Ling Chi would definitely not be able to maintain his speed for long. He raised his guard and waited without any impatience or arrogance. He was certain that Ling Chi wouldn\u2019t be able to spin around him forever, and his own XianTian inner qi wasn\u2019t something that the teen in front of him could ever equal. After cultivating for over thirty years and breaking into the XianTian stage, Yu ManTian\u2019s patience and confidence were already a head above the rest!</p><br/><p>Ling Chi\u2019s footwork suddenly sped up, and \u2018ding ding ding\u2019 sounds could be heard all around. Ling Chi\u2019s body had almost transformed into a blur of white light, while Yu ManTian still maintained his principle of \u2018defense is the best offense\u2019. From afar, both of their bodies could no longer be seen! The only thing that could be seen was a white flash continuously charging at a wall of white light!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Ling Chi let out a crisp cry, and a flash of white light shot into the sky! From the momentum of spinning a few hundred rounds, Ling Chi\u2019s body shot into the air. Without even using any strength, Ling Chi was already 40 feet in the air! His slim figure made a backflip in the air as his long sword shook, turning into thousands of silver lights raining down from above. He then charged at Yu ManTian, like a meteor crashing down to Earth!</p><br/><p>A look of praise could then be seen on Ling Tian\u2019s face, and he said, \u201cGood brat!\u201d Ling Chi actually chose to launch the \u2018Nine Firmament Lightning Flash\u2019 move at such a time! This was definitely Ling Chi\u2019s final move. After all, Ling Chi had already channeled all of his strength into this single attack. After this attack, regardless of victory or defeat, Ling Chi wouldn\u2019t have any strength left!</p><br/><p>If Yu ManTian couldn\u2019t block this attack, he would definitely be sliced up by Ling Chi!</p><br/><p>For Ling Chi to unleash this move now, Ling Tian predicted that Ling Chi had no chance of victory, and would definitely pay a heavy price! If Yu ManTian hadn\u2019t promised to not make any killing blows, Ling Tian would definitely separate the both of them now. Otherwise, Ling Chi might even sacrifice his life as the price!</p><br/><p>Perhaps it isn\u2019t so bad a thing to let this brat suffer a good lesson, Ling Tian thought to himself.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian was wrong. He had underestimated Yu ManTian\u2019s character and his strength!</p><br/><p>Ling Chi had grasped the best timing and his attack was indeed something that Yu ManTian didn\u2019t expect. However, a junior like Ling Chi couldn\u2019t compare to Yu ManTian\u2019s battle experience. Yu ManTian\u2019s strategy was to wait for Ling Chi to run out of stamina before launching his counterattack! Things were different from what Ling Tian had imagined. Even if Yu ManTian couldn\u2019t keep up with Ling Chi\u2019s speed, it didn\u2019t mean that Yu ManTian\u2019s weapon couldn\u2019t. With Yu ManTian\u2019s discernment, he had long since seen through Ling Chi\u2019s attack and could have finished Ling Chi off a long time ago. The only issue was the fact that Ling Chi might be heavily injured or even killed.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t entirely out of the question even with his promise. All martial artists definitely had the instinct to protect themselves. This battle had already far exceeded the realms of a casual spar with Ling Chi and the rest fighting Yu ManTian without holding anything back.</p><br/><p>With Ling Chi unleashing such a deadly attack, none of them could fault Yu ManTian for seriously injuring or even killing Ling Chi!</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian had the experience of two different lives, he was too focused on the outcome instead of the process. He treated his subordinates with sincerity, but he had never nurtured their character. Because of this, Ling Jian, Ling Chi, and the rest of them were all made from the same mold. Ling Tian\u2019s actions had unknowingly caused all of their characters to be a little extreme!</p><br/><p>Even with his wealth of experience, Yu ManTian didn\u2019t expect Ling Chi to change his strategy so suddenly. Furthermore, he had suddenly unleashed a killing move.</p><br/><p>Before the sword arrived, Yu ManTian could already feel the destructive force of it! His face also changed immediately as he thought, What are these brats thinking? What are these brats really trying to do?</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t you guys tell that I have already shown you mercy? I am sparing with you guys, but every single move by you guys is out to kill me! Every single move is filled with killing intent! Don\u2019t tell me\u2026 this is a trap? A trap to kill me?!</p><br/><p>From the self-protective instinct of a martial artist, the instinct of a XianTian expert, Yu ManTian\u2019s first reaction was to retaliate with all his strength! While Ling Chi was the youngest of the five brats, he was also the strongest among them. His moves were well-practiced, and his movement technique was exquisite. He was already no weaker than Ling Jian! Furthermore, Ling Chi had broken through into the 5th stage of the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula a few days back. However, if his skills were compared to Yu ManTian\u2019s retaliation\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Chi wouldn\u2019t just be injured, instead he would definitely die!</p><br/><p>With his XianTian senses alerted, Yu ManTian instinctively spun around. As he spun a shining bright silver lotus, made from sword light, could be seen revolving around his body. Many layers of these lotus flowers then shot upwards to receive Ling Chi\u2019s attack! This was the final move Yu ManTian used to deal with Ling Jian, the \u2018Nine-nine Lotus Seats\u2019!</p><br/><p>It was something for Ling Chi to be proud of to force Yu ManTian to use the \u2018Nine-nine Lotus Seats\u2019!</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian seemed to have realized something, but it was already too late. It was already far too late for him to stop Yu ManTian! As long as both the attacks collided, Ling Chi would certainly die! There was no way he could emerge alive!</p><br/><p>As for Ling Jian and the rest, because of their lack of experience and the fact that there was no risk in the previous battles, they couldn\u2019t notice the danger Ling Chi was in!</p><br/><p>In the instant both their swords crossed, Yu ManTian\u2019s usually proud face revealed a trace of comprehension!</p><br/><p>After the loud ring of metal clashing, Ling Chi\u2019s body flew out and Yu ManTian took a few steps back. His already red face turned completely dark red, and he slowly walked towards the direction that Ling Chi had flown.</p><br/><p>Ling Chi didn\u2019t die?!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian had already flown up into the air, grabbing Ling Chi\u2019s body and landing gently back on the ground. After checking Ling Chi\u2019s breathing, he quickly placed a pill in Ling Chi\u2019s mouth. At the same time, he placed a palm on Ling Chi\u2019s chest and another on Ling Chi\u2019s back, transmitting a pure wave of inner qi!</p><br/><p>Ling Chi\u2019s injuries weren\u2019t too far off from his prediction. While his injuries were a little more serious as compared to Ling Feng and the rest, they weren\u2019t too serious!</p><br/><p>Apart from Yu ManTian himself, only Ling Tian knew what had just happened.</p><br/><p>With Yu ManTian\u2019s martial arts, while the previous situation was critical, it was all under his control. However, Ling Chi\u2019s final attack was just far too dangerous, causing Yu ManTian to be suspicious. Without thinking too much, he unleashed the \u2018Nine-nine Lotus Seats\u2019 with all his strength.</p><br/><p>If both the moves were to collide, Ling Chi would certainly be dead. Although Yu ManTian promised not to kill, the five of them had unleashed killing moves at every moment in their spar with him. Limiting Yu ManTian from unleashing any killer moves was already extremely unreasonable. While Ling Tian was wise, some of his thoughts were no more than wishful thinking. This was a flaw in Ling Tian\u2019s character that he only thought from his own perspective and didn\u2019t consider other\u2019s point of view. In other words, even if Yu ManTian were to kill Ling Chi, it wasn\u2019t unreasonable for him to do so!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

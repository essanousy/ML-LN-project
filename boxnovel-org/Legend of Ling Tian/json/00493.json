Your NanGong Family is bold indeed. Do you guys not want to live anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Mournful laughter could be heard, and NanGong Yu walked forward with bone-deep hatred in her eyes. \u201cLing Chen, Ling Tian killed my father in cruelty. Do you think that there is a need for us to be courteous to your Ling Family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue glared at NanGong Yu\u2019s slightly distorted appearance and finally understood what went wrong, \u201cSince young noble killed your father, all of you can go and find young noble for revenge. What is the point of all of you blocking two weak ladies like us?\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu ignored Li Xue completely as she said while gnashing her teeth, \u201cLing Chen! You are only a lowly servant. Are you curious why I would choose you as a target? Haha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu\u2019s eyes turned bloodshot and she let out a crazed laugh. \u201cYour biggest sin is the fact that you are far too beautiful. Every guy wants to talk about you and treat you like a treasure. Furthermore, Ling Tian also trusts you so much to allow you to manage all of his forces. What are you? You are no more than a lowly slave! You are just a slave that can be bought with money! You are just a\u2026 you do not deserve to be alive in this world! If I kill you, I believe that Ling Tian will definitely be heartbroken! He will definitely be devastated! HAHAHAHA, I want his heart to be shattered and be filled with devastation!!\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu then continued with a malevolent expression, \u201cDo not dream that anyone will come to save you. I have to say that you are far too careless. To think that you will only bring out a single maid. I originally thought that this might be a trap but the forces of the Ling Family are all stationed a few miles away. With our current strength, taking you down is as simple as snapping our fingers! We are lucky indeed! Doesn\u2019t Ling Tian treat you like a precious gem? HAHAHA\u2026 I will make this precious gem of his be under the bodies of over a hundred men!!! Since Ling Tian killed my father and destroyed the hopes of my NanGong Family, I will let Ling Tian be the biggest cuckold on the continent! I will let his most beloved woman die from pleasure under the bodies of over a hundred men! I will make sure you suffer a fate worse than death!\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu said viciously, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t kill you. I will catch you and after the guards under my command enjoy themselves fully, I will sell you to the dirtiest brothel in Gold Jade City and allow boorish men to play with you and humiliate you every day! Humiliate a lady like you who should not have such a status!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing NanGong Yu\u2019s crazed and distorted expression, Li Xue let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>Her original deduction was extremely accurate and there was indeed a huge flaw in their plan. However, their plan still succeeded because Li Xue missed two points. First, the information network of the NanGong Family was greatly lacking, and they were unaware that Ling Chen wasn\u2019t a weak and helpless lady. In fact, she was a top-notch expert in the world today, and there weren\u2019t many capable of subduing her! Second, which is probably the greater reason, was because of a woman\u2019s jealousy!</p><br/><p>Once a woman is filled with jealousy, she will turn completely unreasonable! Especially when the jealousy that she has been suppressing for a long time explodes forth, it would be akin to a woman losing her mind! She would be crazy to the point that she hated the fact that the world could not be destroyed!</p><br/><p>It seems like NanGong Yu\u2019s jealousy towards Ling Chen was far too intense and was probably planted a long time ago. Regardless of looks or talent, Ling Chen was more than a notch above NanGong Yu. Or perhaps, it could be said that the two of them were on completely different levels and could not even be compared. Li Xue guessed that this probably resulted in disequilibrium in the heart of the usually spoiled NanGong Yu.</p><br/><p>However, this alone wasn\u2019t enough! Li Xue could feel that NanGong Yu would always pause unnaturally whenever she said the words \u2018Ling Tian\u2019. At the same time, it seemed as though there was a deep hatred and bitterness accompanied with anger and hopelessness\u2026 all of this made Li Xue come to a realization.</p><br/><p>After NanGong Yu entered Sky Bearing, she first became enemies with the Yang Family and later realized that Ling Tian was merely concealing himself. Following that, everything that happened fully displayed Ling Tian\u2019s strength and talents. That originally restless maiden\u2019s heart of hers was naturally ensnared. Following that, they began to work together with the Ling Family for mutual benefits, and NanGong Yu felt a trace of hope in her heart. However, her hope was short-lived, and her father died in Ling Tian\u2019s hands. This completely destroyed NanGong Yu\u2019s one-sided fantasy.</p><br/><p>With such a mental blow, NanGong Yu made a crazy decision. She wanted to destroy the Ling Family, destroy Ling Chen, destroy the Ling Family Courtyard, destroy Ling Tian and at the very end, destroy herself!</p><br/><p>Before all of that, NanGong Yu decided to make Ling Chen her first target! This was because Ling Chen\u2019s outstanding qualities made NanGong Yu who was always on her high horse feel a sense of inferiority. As long as Ling Chen was by Ling Tian\u2019s side, NanGong Yu would not have any confidence to fight for anything! At the same time, Ling Chen was the most beloved woman of her greatest enemy!</p><br/><p>Thus, NanGong Yu did not want to just kill Ling Chen. She wanted to humiliate, insult and trample over Ling Chen before that!</p><br/><p><em>What a crazy woman!</em> Li Xue let out a sigh! At the same time, her thoughts floated to Ling Tian. <em>Just how many ladies did he provoke and how many of them would go crazy for him?</em></p><br/><p>From an infamous profligate son to a wise and majestic leader. He was a young hero who had unparalleled literary talents and outstanding martial arts. The ugly duckling had turned into a beautiful swan! This was a melodramatic plot that no young maiden could resist! Especially the ladies who used to look down on Ling Tian. When Ling Tian explodes forth with talent, they would first be in doubt, then filled with curiosity and finally investigating the matter on their own. With the many legends as rock solid evidence to prove Ling Tian\u2019s outstanding qualities, they would then be trapped in their fairytale\u2026</p><br/><p>It was truly a good method to pick up girls!</p><br/><p>It was difficult for any young lady to resist the story of a frog becoming a prince\u2026</p><br/><p>No matter how good Ling Chen\u2019s self-restraint was and how developed her mental state was, she was still a young lady who was less than twenty years old. NanGong Yu\u2019s vicious words had angered her to the point that her whole body was trembling. NanGong Yu\u2019s words were far too vicious and despicable! To a lady, such a humiliation was unacceptable! Even the thought of it would make one feel complete disgust, much less experiencing it for herself!</p><br/><p>Ling Chen growled with palpable anger, \u201cNanGong Yu! I never imagined you to be so vicious! However, do you think that all of you will have the strength to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu smiled sinisterly, \u201cLing Chen, do you really think that I am unaware of your martial arts? If you really didn\u2019t possess any martial arts, how would you dare to come out alone? While I have to admit that you have concealed the matter extremely well, there is no secret in the world that won\u2019t be revealed. While you only took action a single time in Sky Bearing and waved a whip around a few times, you completely revealed yourself at that time! But even if your martial arts aren\u2019t weak, can I be any weaker than you? Do you know how long I have been planning to kill you? Do you think that I am joking with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu then stretched out her arms and pointed at the people around her, \u201cAll of these men are the iron blooded warriors of my NanGong Family and the final troops that my NanGong Family can bring out! However, it is also our strongest force! Besides that, my second uncle is leading them personally! Do you think the two of you will be able to escape from my heaven encompassing net? So what if you two know martial arts? What use will it be? We are still a couple of miles away from your Ling Family Courtyard and I don\u2019t believe that they can save you before we succeed! That\u2019s right, someone like you who has lived your life in luxury probably hasn\u2019t killed before\u2026 HAHAHA\u2026 take action!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following NanGong Yu\u2019s orders, NanGong TianHu let out a laugh and waved his hands, \u201cBrothers, charge! The first one to catch this peerless beauty will be the first to enjoy her! You will also be the first one to make Ling Tian a cuckold! I promise all of you that everyone will have a share of this beauty in front of you! Didn\u2019t you hear that this lass knows martial arts? She will definitely be able to endure our torment! All of you are in luck!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the NanGong Family warriors let out a loud roar and their faces were filled with lascivious smiles as they pounced like wolves towards Ling Chen. Not to mention touching such a beauty, it was difficult for them to even see a beauty like Ling Chen! Now, as long as they could capture this weak and helpless beauty in front of them, they would be able to do as they wished\u2026</p><br/><p>As these warriors fantasized about pressing Ling Chen down beneath them and the possible expressions on her face, their faces flushed red from excitement and they charged forward like raging bulls.</p><br/><p>At this moment, only NanGong Yu realized that something was wrong. While there was shame, anger, and indignance in her eyes, there wasn\u2019t any fear, panic or confusion\u2026</p><br/><p><em>Could it be that she isn\u2019t afraid at all?! What does this mean? Is there something that I missed?!</em></p><br/><p>Anger!</p><br/><p>Extreme anger!</p><br/><p>This was the first time Ling Chen had the urge to rip the people in front of her into shreds! Even when Long Xiang and the Yang Family surrounded their Ling Residence, the gentle Ling Chen had avoided the possibility of being stained with blood. But right now, for the first time in her life, Ling Chen was boiling with an uncontrollable killing intent! The usually warm smile by her lips had exploded forth with a frightening killing intent!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This was practically the remaining strength that their family had. Sending all of them just to silence a lass that did not know martial arts, wasn\u2019t that equivalent to lifting a mountain to smash a chicken egg?!</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu\u2019s brows were slightly furrowed, an expression of worry on her face as she replied, \u201cCaution allows a ship to sail for ten thousand years! Besides, even if we send out all our forces, the success rate might not be that high.\u201d She seemed to be talking to NanGong TianHu, but at the same time reminding herself, her voice lowered to almost a whisper.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, Yu\u2019er. The plan this time will definitely succeed.\u201d NanGong TianHu placated her. \u201cIf we can\u2019t even kill such a powerless lass, it would be as though a curse has descended upon us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTo deal with Ling Tian, we definitely cannot just stick to small-scale events. This will only invite trouble.\u201d NanGong Yu smiled bitterly. \u201cOnce we move, there will be no more room for retreat, thus we have to completely uproot his influence, settling it once and for all!\u201d She sighed, \u201cLing Tian this person, he is\u2026 too scary! I really hope that Justice will not slip up! He is the only one who can really get rid of Ling Tian!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur first objective is to throw Ling Tian\u2019s personal forces and influences into chaos, forcing those eyeing his assets to make a move. When the time comes, everyone shall attack together, and in the shortest time, dig the assets of the Ling Family clean.\u201d NanGong Yu coldly remarked, \u201cSo long as we can get our revenge, the NanGong Family can temporarily go into hiding, and disappear from the sights of everyone in this world. We\u2019ll wait until the continent is unified before making plans to deal with the ruling family at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that so? In this chaotic age, this is precisely the best time for a man to carve out his career. Why should we go into hiding?\u201d This was out of NanGong TianHu\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that Second Uncle still thinks our NanGong Family has the ability to unite this continent?\u201d NanGong Yu snapped harshly. \u201cIf we do not go into hiding, it means that we have to choose a side and fight it out. With the current fragile strength of the NanGong Family, do you think we can afford such an extravagant consumption? Furthermore, after the battle for the continent, all the various influences will have received some sort of damage to their forces. At that time, we who have bided our time and gathered our strength will then be able to conspicuously stand out! Only then can our NanGong Family be considered to have risen from the ashes, with enough capabilities and hope!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, NanGong TianHu was still a little miffed over this. As a man, his objective was to rush headfirst onto the battlefield, proving his mettle through war. Only then would he have truly lived! To retreat silently, grinding the prime years of his life against the peaceful forests, he might as well commit suicide!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe command of Family Head lies in my hands. I am the head of the family here!\u201d NanGong Yu icily replied, her tone unquestionable, \u201cThis matter shall be decided as such! This is also the last chance our NanGong Family has to rise back up again! I will not allow anyone to question my decision!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs such, the plan to assassinate Ling Chen can only allow success and not failure!\u201d Her eyes grew sharp and piercing. \u201cThe glory of the NanGong Family relies on this final stroke!\u201d At this moment, her slim body was already exuding a sort of pressuring aura, allowing NanGong TianHu to feel that, his niece actually had this sort of prestige and might to her, even possibly surpassing that of his elder brother\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce we have settled the final rites for Father, those involved will set off that very day, infiltrating Sky Bearing, and waiting for the opportune time to strike! Immediately activate all the secret agents of the NanGong Family who are currently in Sky Bearing to search for any and all news regarding Ling Chen!\u201d NanGong Yu sent out her final command.</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu let out a long breath. Ever since she returned from Sky Bearing, the only thing that ever interested her since then was researching about Ling Tian. Whatever he had done, she had browsed through and dissected it, but the more she delved, the more she realized how impossible it was to unravel this person called Ling Tian! Maybe, she never stood a chance in researching against someone of Ling Tian\u2019s caliber. A pity that they were now enemies\u2026</p><br/><p>As for NanGong Yu\u2019s plan, even in the viewpoint of Ling Tian, it was the best and most suitable choice for the NanGong Family. From this, it could be seen just how astute and wise this daughter of NanGong TianLong was. If she could continue at the helm of the family, sooner or later, there would be a day when the NanGong Family rose once again.</p><br/><p>Sadly, NanGong Yu was unaware that she had already committed a fatal error\u2026 an error that would result in the downfall of the entire family! Ling Chen was not the weak and pathetic lass in their minds, but rather a first-tier expert of martial arts to the point that if one were to compare her among the peers of her generation, she would not have any opponents!</p><br/><p>Of course, this category excluded monsters such as Ling Tian and Li Xue, those characters from another world\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou released her grip, allowing the piece of paper in her palm to fall weakly to the ground.</p><br/><p>While she had known early on that her brother Shui QianHuan had caused a huge loss for their family this time, and that it was impossible to avoid punishment, she never expected it to arrive so quickly and for the punishment to be so severe!</p><br/><p>\u201cRevoking all authority that Shui QianHuan has outside, stripping him of his right as the first successor of the Family. Because of his faults, he will await punishment by the enforcement squad. All matters outside the family will temporarily fall to Shui QianJiang to oversee, with QianHu, QianHai, and QianRou assisting. The family will dispatch the six Great Elders from the Snow Hall, as well as 500 experts of the family to rush to Heavenly Star to provide support.</p><br/><p>The content of the letter was simple, yet brutally shocking! Only Shui QianRou herself knew just how perilous the situation was. Those names written together with hers on the letters were all the strongest competitors of her brother. It was because of her brother\u2019s outstanding performance that he had managed to trump over all of them and become the first in line for successor! While he basked in immeasurable glory, it was no surprise that he turned into the object of jealousy. With the others already being so unscrupulous even back in their hometown at Heavenly Wind, just what would happen when her brother fell into their hands once they arrived? Would he even manage to survive under them?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, her brother Shui QianHuan shared the same parents as her, but Shui QianHu and the rest were the sons of her eldest uncle. Now that the family made such a choice, it was as good as handing over her brother\u2019s position to Shui QianJiang! If that was the case, then was her father now at a disadvantage in the battle for supremacy in the family? Did anything happen to him?</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou could feel her intestines twisting with guilt. She suddenly recalled that her brother was still stuck in Northern Wei far away and wondered why, even after such a huge commotion was kicked up, that he had yet to come back! That was the home turf of the Yu Family and right now, without help from their subordinate contacts, what would happen if he got into trouble? Most likely, he would have to remain there for life!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn another three days, Shui QianHu and the rest will arrive. Once they do, they would definitely grind their knives on my brother who is treated like a criminal now. What should I do?\u201d Shui QianRou muttered to herself, as she furrowed her brows tightly, at her wit\u2019s end.</p><br/><p>This was the decree of the family. Even if her own brother had countless means to escape, he did not dare to use them, nor could he. However, once he fell into the hands of those three, what sort of humiliation would he then be put through? With the pride her older brother had, how would he be able to endure it?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is second sister worrying about now? What about three days later? Could the sky be collapsing by then?\u201d With her white robes fluttering in the wind, Ling Chen walked over with a faint smile on her face. It was as though a snow lotus suddenly bloomed within the area, as her entrance suddenly transformed the entire place, even the air, to become elegant and refined.</p><br/><p>Ever since Li Xue entered the Ling Outer Courtyard, under her careful guidance, Ling Chen\u2019s Divine Ice Formula had improved with the speed of a rocket. Her current strength was miles ahead of where she was previously. Following the increase in cultivation realms, her originally cold attitude much like that of frost had slowly transformed into a purity similar to that of snow jade. This was like the saying \u2018A character akin to ice, but even more reserved than sub-zero temperatures\u2019. She had unconsciously started to display an aura of sacredness and holiness.</p><br/><p>A hint of envy appeared in Shui QianRou\u2019s eyes. While she did not lose out to Ling Chen in terms of appearance, but this unblemished as ice, cold as snow, and pure as jade bearing of the latter was far above what she could display. Furthermore, there was a form of mysterious temperament on Ling Chen that Shui QianRou had never seen on any other women except for the newcomer Li Xue! If Ling Chen in the past could be considered a piece of ice capable of freezing one\u2019s internal organs, she was now like a cold piece of jade that would unknowingly seep into the hearts of people!</p><br/><p>The auras exuding from both Ling Chen and Li Xue were similar. Be it the cold martial skills they used, or their cool bearings, both of them seemed to be cut from the same mold, truly fascinating. If one had to pick a difference, then that would be Ling Chen being more elegant and refined, while Li Xue was more lofty and independent. One embodied a snow lotus, while the other an arrogant winter plum!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you together with Sister Xue, instead of coming to look for this little sister? It\u2019s not very nice of you to tease this little sister like so.\u201d Shui QianRou smiled in response, immediately recollecting all her scattered thoughts. Being one of the successors-in-line within the Shui Family, how could she be lacking in training to manage her emotions and thoughts? While she treated Ling Chen like a true elder sister, there were matters of the heart which she could not easily reveal.</p><br/><p>Within this period of time, the great Miss Li Xue had made use of her networking skills from her past life to get all \u2018hot and intimate\u2019 with the three ladies she termed as \u2018Ling Tian\u2019s women\u2019, almost to the point of them becoming akin to family. Even blood-related siblings might not compare to the current closeness of their relationships.</p><br/><p>Within this warm and loving sisterly environment, Shui QianRou also indulged in it, placing home and duty behind her. This place had more sincerity and warmth when compared to her true home, the Shui Family, causing her to always feel wistful and reluctant to leave this place\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

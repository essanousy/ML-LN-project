The one slightly weaker should probably be Meng WuYi who never leaves Meng WuQing\u2019s side. A thousand-year-old sect is different indeed! Even if they have declined, the combat prowess of these few individuals can\u2019t be underestimated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head, if this battle continues, while we will be able to wipe out our enemies completely, we will have to pay an immense price to do so. Should this subordinate take action immediately to quickly end this battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly end this battle?\u201d Yu ManLou seemed to have heard a joke and a smile could be seen on his face. However, this smile of his was filled with coldness, \u201cMeng WuQing and the two by his side obviously have some strength left. If all of you take action right now, the three of them would definitely fight back at full force. It is best for us to exhaust them further first.\u201d Yu ManLou then paused for a moment before continuing, \u201cThe thing I am puzzled about is why these Above Heavens experts would appear in the courtyard of my third son! Who can give me an explanation?!\u201d</p><br/><p>While the tone Yu ManLou used was extremely soft and light-hearted, the two individuals by the side immediately realized something and lowered their heads without saying a word.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou sneered, \u201cIt seems that my children have truly given me a huge surprise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unable to bear the tense atmosphere, a black-robed expert stammered, \u201cPerhaps\u2026 third young noble didn\u2019t know their identities\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, letting them stay at his courtyard meant for hiding his love affairs without knowing their identities?\u201d Yu ManLou chuckled, \u201cBig Hei, can you even convince yourself to believe that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them couldn\u2019t help but break out in a cold sweat. While Yu ManLou had an amiable smile on his face right now, these two individuals who had followed Yu ManLou for a long time could naturally sense the uncontrollable anger in Yu ManLou\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Another two miserable groans could be heard from below and two Yu Family experts died in the battlefield with their corpses trampled and mutilated in just a short moment. After being sent flying by one of the reinforcements of the Yu Family, both of their corpses were at the very least \u2018intact\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a huge disturbance tonight was truly out of this old man\u2019s expectations,\u201d Yu ManLou said with a chilly voice as though he couldn\u2019t be bothered about the deaths of his subordinates. \u201cThat second son of mine is probably behind this matter right? They are truly \u2018close brothers\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two black-robed men shivered as their backs turned cold, and a cold sweat had already drenched their clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, the Head Deacon should be aware of this matter as well, right?\u201d Yu ManLou watched the skinny figure engaging in a bloody battle and said calmly, \u201cPerhaps he may even be the mastermind of this incident. However, this old man who is their father was actually the last to find out! If not for that little brat Ling Tian playing his little tricks, this old man wouldn\u2019t be here to personally witness such an exciting show! If that\u2019s the case, I would even have to thank Ling Tian!\u201d These final words of his were said with a chilly tone as a dense killing intent shot out from his eyes!</p><br/><p>Both the black-robed man couldn\u2019t help but turn to face each other. After serving Yu ManLou together for so many years, both of them had already achieved great chemistry and couldn\u2019t help but wonder why their Family Head talked about Ling Tian at such a moment. Could it be that their Family Head was angered by his sons\u2019 degeneracy to the point his thoughts weren\u2019t clear? This Ling Tian was truly a capable individual. Regardless of the matter, as long as they decided to investigate it thoroughly, Ling Tian\u2019s figure would definitely appear in the matter. This was truly the mark of an extremely capable individual! Both the black-robed men couldn\u2019t help but muse to themselves.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was suddenly startled as his own words reminded him about something. Ling Tian! Could this be a part of Ling Tian\u2019s schemes? The motive of this scheme was obvious, to drive both the Yu and Xiao families to opposing ends and form an irreconcilable enmity between our families so that he can fish for benefits from the side. If not, my second son certainly wouldn\u2019t be able to come up with such a detailed plan!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Yu ManLou was shocked by his own thoughts. Could it be that of both my sons, one of them colluded with Above Heavens and the other one is colluding with Ling Tian?</p><br/><p>If someone were to say that there wasn\u2019t an inside story to this affair, Yu ManLou would be the first to disagree with that! Everything definitely has a cause and effect. This incident couldn\u2019t have happened without any rhyme or reason. If not, how could it be that they coexisted in harmony for such a long time but broke out in conflict the moment Ling Tian arrived?</p><br/><p>However, if Ling Tian was truly the person behind this affair, he would definitely have another trick up his sleeves! Thinking about this, Yu ManLou felt a heavy feeling in his heart before feeling elated. With the bulk of the Yu Family\u2019s elites being present, as long as Ling Tian appeared now or something odd occurred, he would be able to deal Ling Tian a heavy blow or even get rid of this huge trouble by his side!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s narrowed his eyes as his gaze swept passed the battlefield slowly and watched for any oddities in the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian should probably be watching all of this by the side, right? Yu ManLou\u2019s lips curled up in a trace of mockery. Want to watch a show involving my Yu Family? If that\u2019s the case, you will probably have to come out and put on a show as well!</p><br/><p>Two robust figures dashed over from afar at a lightning fast speed. The moment they landed on the ground, they immediately joined in the battle and the situation in the battle changed again. While every one of the remaining Above Heavens experts was a top-notch expert, the gathering experts of the Yu Family weren\u2019t much weaker. In fact, they were stronger than the Above Heavens experts in almost all ways. Furthermore, the final few experts who joined in the fray were the Pavilion Heads of the Yu Family. Their strength was no weaker than Meng WuQing and Meng WuYi, and the Above Heavens experts felt an immense increase in pressure. Even the most powerful Meng WuQing and Meng WuYi had no choice but to unleash their full strength to defend against the incoming attackers. As for the weaker experts of Above Heavens, they were in an even more miserable state.</p><br/><p>In just a short while later, another two Above Heavens experts died under the weapons of the Yu Family and a hole was formed in the defensive circle of the Above Heavens experts. If Meng WuQing and Meng WuYi still did not go all out at this moment, they would no longer have the chance to do so. The both of them let out a loud roar and spread out to the left and right. Two brilliant rays of sword light shot out of the encirclement and blood sprayed out in all directions, raining down on all the experts present. The Head Deacon was originally at the frontline of the battle but after these two brilliant sword rays shot out, he made a swift retreat and felt a tinge of chill at the top of his head before feeling a sharp pain. A layer of his scalp was actually shaved off.</p><br/><p>\u201cRetreat!\u201d Meng WuQing shouted and blocked all the Yu Family experts together with Meng WuYi. An empty space was immediately formed in the encirclement and the remaining two experts of Above Heavens, Meng JueChen and Meng WuHui, made use of that opportunity to jump up to the roof. The both of them knew that Meng WuQing and Meng WuYi would never retreat before them and they would only be a burden by staying behind.</p><br/><p>The experts of Above Heavens were truly united. Despite being in such a precarious situation, not a single one of them retreated out of cowardice!</p><br/><p>Meng WuHui was originally the same level expert as Meng WuQing. However, he suffered inner injuries from the battle with Justice and had not recovered fully yet, thus becoming a burden in this battle. He already felt extremely guilty in his heart and now that he had the chance, he quickly made a retreat lest he becomes a burden. He had already made a decision in his heart that if he couldn\u2019t make use of this opportunity to escape, then he would rather sacrifice his life to give his brothers a chance to escape. He would never remain beside them and become a burden.</p><br/><p>The figures watching by the side flew to the skies and blocked Meng JueCheng and Meng WuHui together. Below, Meng WuQing and Meng WuYi let out a roar and shot their swords towards the sky to obstruct the two Pavilion Heads who wanted to block Meng JueChen and Meng WuHui.</p><br/><p>The Head Deacon let out a sharp scream and with both anger and humiliation, his sword shot towards Meng WuYi. On the ground, almost all of the Yu Family experts who could react in time shot towards the air and gave chase.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Hei, should I capture them, let them off, or kill them all?\u201d Yu ManLou watched the four escaping Above Heavens experts heartlessly and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 this subordinate does not know.\u201d Big Hei bowed down and broke out in a cold sweat.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that this matter involved Yu ManLou\u2019s two sons. How would he dare to express his opinion?</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou shut his eyes with fatigue and said with a tinge of weariness, \u201cLet it be then. If they are lucky, let them off. If they aren\u2019t so lucky, kill them all. Even if they can be captured alive, don\u2019t give them a chance to say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the Family Head is wise.\u201d Big Hei acknowledged Yu ManLou\u2019s words and sighed in his heart. Yu ManLou naturally has his reasons for letting them go. While Big Hei did not know what the reason was, he was certain that Yu ManLou had his own reasons. As for killing them, it was naturally so that he wouldn\u2019t hear anything he didn\u2019t want to.</p><br/><p>Just why were these Above Heavens experts in third young noble\u2019s courtyard? What was their relationship with third young noble? Why would second young noble and the Head Deacon plan this operation? How much was hidden within this affair? The two of them did not dare to ask these questions and were not willing to find out the answers to them as well. They just did not dare to know the answer to those questions!</p><br/><p>While Yu ManLou was definitely able to deduce all of these matters, he did not want to think about them right now. He had just lost his most outstanding son and even if his other two sons were degenerates, they were still his own flesh and blood. It was impossible for him to punish both of his sons at such a moment regardless of the mistakes they made!</p><br/><p>But if he were to catch the Above Heavens experts alive, he wouldn\u2019t have a choice but to face all of these fairly. By letting them off, he would still be able to make use of them but he could never catch them alive!</p><br/><p>These Above Heavens experts had already killed so many of their Yu Family\u2019s experts and a few of their brothers had died in the hands of their Yu Family experts as well. The enmity between them was already irreconcilable, but their Family Head still chose to let them escape if their luck was good. Just what did this mean? Could it be that their Yu Family brothers died for nothing?</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Meng WuHui, who had landed on the roof, noticed the precarious situation of his brothers. A resolute gaze shot out from his eyes and he shot back towards the ground. He was immediately stabbed by the two Pavilion Heads of the Yu Family but it seemed as though he did not notice a thing and he dashed past the sides of his brothers. After spitting out a mouthful of blood, the splendor of his sword light exploded forth and blocked all of the incoming Yu Family experts charging towards him. He had actually single-handedly blocked a few experts who were not weaker than himself!</p><br/><p>He then shouted in a hoarse but resolute voice, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to sacrifice my life for nothing, leave now!\u201d After that, he was swallowed by the numerous weapons.</p><br/><p>Meng WuQing and Meng WuYi let out an indignant roar but did not hesitate in the slightest. Without even looking back, they shot up towards the roof and after meeting up with Meng JueChen, they immediately fled for their lives. They knew that their brother had just used a forbidden technique which burned up his life essence to create an opportunity for the two of them to escape. No matter what, Meng WuHui\u2019s death was certain and there was nothing they could do to reverse the situation!</p><br/><p>In the surroundings, arrows shot over from the surroundings and the sounds of metal clashing rang out incessantly. Then, a low grunt could be heard, and Meng WuYi suffered an arrow to his left shoulder, causing him to almost fall off from the roof. Meng WuQing hurriedly brandished his sword to deflect all the incoming arrows and charged out with Meng WuYi.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a swooshing sound could be heard and a few Pavilion Head level experts rushed over. Meng WuQing and Meng WuYi looked at each other and saw the grief in each other\u2019s eyes. Their third brother had stayed behind to block these experts and now that these experts were chasing after them safe and sound, it could only mean one thing: their third brother had already perished! While they knew that their third brother had used a forbidden technique and his death was certain, affirming the matter was a completely different matter.</p><br/><p>There was an obstruction in the front and enemies chasing after them from the back. Furthermore, arrows were raining down upon them like a thunderstorm and they were currently in the territory of their enemy. Of the three of them left, there were already two of them who were injured and there were no less than seven to eight top-notch experts eyeing on them by the side. All of a sudden, the three of them couldn\u2019t help but be overwhelmed by a wave of hopelessness.</p><br/><p>Meng JueChen let out a roar of hopelessness and was like a beast trapped in a pitfall. He then clenched his teeth, raised his sword, turned around and charged towards the pursing Yu Family experts. Meng WuQing let out a long sigh. Since there wasn\u2019t a hope for them to escape, why was there a need to abandon one more of their brothers? He knew that Meng JueChen turned around so that he could use his life to buy them a little bit of time to increase their chances of escape!</p><br/><p>However, Meng WuQing did not want to escape any further. Almost all of his brothers had perished in Bright Jade City and what was the point for him to escape alone? Furthermore, he would still have to face the punishment of his sect if he returned alive. If that\u2019s the case, he might as well accompany his brothers to the yellow springs road!</p><br/><p>Both Meng WuQing and Meng WuYi had the same thoughts and turned around in unison with a resolution to die!</p><br/><p>Cutting off all paths of retreat and fighting with their backs against the river! Even if they are going to die, they must definitely squeeze out a few more drops of blood from the Yu Family!</p><br/><p>The three of them charged back in an almost maniacal manner obviously intending to fight to the death. This action of theirs shocked the Yu Family experts, especially the Vice Pavilion Head of the River Mountain Pavilion, who was still delighted after killing Meng WuHui and giving chase at the very front. However, he never expected the three Above Heavens experts to charge back at them instead of escaping for their lives. With this slight moment of distraction, the three of them were already in front of this Vice Pavilion Head. At this moment this Vice Pavilion Head was still in midair and with his robes fluttering in the winds looking extremely carefree.</p><br/><p>Thus, he also died in an extremely carefree manner!</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d A couple of people cried out and quickly made their way over.</p><br/><p>However, what kind of a person was Meng WuYi? How would he be willing to let go of this opportunity that he had spent so much effort to create? Furthermore, his own brother had died in the hands of this individual and even if he had to exchange his life to take revenge, it would be worth it.</p><br/><p>Like three meteors, the three of them clashed together and Meng WuYi intentionally sped up in front of Meng WuQing to welcome the Vice Pavilion Head\u2019s sword. Turning his body slightly, his opponent\u2019s sword stabbed into his right shoulder and his own sword stabbed right into the abdomen of his opponent. His left fist was then clenched into a fist and he smashed it into the nose of his opponent.</p><br/><p>A malevolent glare could be seen in Meng WuQing\u2019s gaze and both he and Meng JueChen stabbed their swords towards their hated enemy. His sword shot towards his enemy\u2019s abdomen and Meng JueChen\u2019s sword shot towards his enemy\u2019s neck. Meng JueChen wanted to slice off the head of this enemy who killed his own brother!</p><br/><p>Because of this, he had also paid the price of two palm strikes, one kick, and one sword. But with a flick of his sword, a big head with a shocked expression flew towards the sky! Meng JueChen was already spitting out mouthfuls of blood, but a trace of delight could still be seen in his eyes as he burst out in laughter and with a kick sent the head flying to the horizon.</p><br/><p>If there were national soccer players present, they would definitely kowtow to take Meng JueChen as a coach. If they could master this kick, not to mention the quarter or semi-finals, even the championship would be firmly in their grasp\u2026</p><br/><p>As for the \u2018ball\u2019 which was kicked by Meng JueChen, that Vice Pavilion Head naturally died a carefree death and was deader than dead!</p><br/><p>While they had killed the enemy that they wanted to kill, the three of them were once again surrounded. They had suffered heavy injuries, and their situation was even more precarious than before.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the three of them no longer had any thoughts of staying alive. Instead, they were full of battle intent and grew more and more valiant as they fought. As the members of the Yu Family faced the valiant Above Heavens experts, while victory was already within their grasp, they were still filled with shock!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian hid in the shadows and shook his head with a bitter laugh. These three fellows are truly like idiots. To think that they don\u2019t even know how to escape. Even if you guys are willing to throw away your lives, if all of you were to die an unknown death in Bright Jade City, when would the Yu and Xiao Families be able to fall out with each other?</p><br/><p>It seems like this young noble has to take personal action. Forget it, the heavens will reward the kind and let me be a flawless citizen for once!</p><br/><p>Seeing the three individuals about to lose their lives, Yu ManLou who was watching from afar suddenly lit up with a powerful battle intent! The two black-robed individuals beside him couldn\u2019t help but be bewildered. With victory right in front of their eyes, why would their Family Head suddenly display such a battle intent?</p><br/><p>On the battlefield, the three of them were already in extreme danger with their lives hanging on a thread.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was indeed a soul brother of Ling Tian. As he watched closely from the side, he was certain that if Ling Tian was present, this was the best moment for Ling Tian to take action. As long as Ling Tian delayed for even the slightest bit, it would be too late for him to do anything!</p><br/><p>If Ling Tian did not take action now, it would mean that he wasn\u2019t present here and there wouldn\u2019t be any meaning for him to wait here with his Yu Family experts.</p><br/><p>In actuality how would Ling Tian not wish to take action? But just when he was about to take action, he felt an immense wave of danger in his heart. It was as though there was an extremely venomous snake eyeing him from the dark! That bone-chilling feeling sent a chill down his spine, and Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but tremble.</p><br/><p>Could there be someone watching me in the dark?</p><br/><p>With such a disturbance in the city, where could Yu ManLou be at such a moment? There was definitely something fishy about this matter. The mantis stalks the cicada unaware of the oriole behind. Could it be that there was an eagle behind him, the oriole?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was filled with a cold chill!</p><br/><p>However, the battlefield was growing more and more dangerous by the second and if he didn\u2019t take action now, all of his arrangements would go to waste. With the strength of the Yu Family in Bright Jade City, they were definitely capable of sealing up the news regarding the experts of Above Heavens. But if the news of the Above Heavens experts\u2019 deaths doesn\u2019t spread out, how would he be able to instigate a war between both the families?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had still decided to take action. Even if he knew that Yu ManLou was waiting for him to take action, he had no other choice!</p><br/><p>How could he allow all of his efforts to go to waste?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian crouched down and moved slowly in the darkness.</p><br/><p>Seeing the many experts of the Yu Family inching nearer and nearer to them, Meng WuQing let out a sneer. Is it finally the time to die? Let death come then! This old man will definitely pull a couple of them down with me!</p><br/><p>With a loud scream, the experts of the Yu Family charged over. Meng WuQing and Meng WuYi looked at each other and gave a carefree smile. Just when they were about to face the Yu Family experts, they suddenly saw a gold and silver light flash past their eyes and numerous hidden weapons exploded forth like a peacock spreading its tail. With a dreamy rainbow colored light and a threatening killing intent, the hidden weapons sprayed towards the Yu Family experts who were charging over!</p><br/><p>With victory right in front of their eyes and their opponent without the strength to fight back, the Yu Family experts charged forward excitedly. However, they never imagined that they would be greeted by a bunch of hidden weapons instead! The silver and gold needles sliced through the air with a powerful penetrative power and shot through the Yu Family experts carrying with them trails of blood!</p><br/><p>Their extreme joy turned into sorrow!</p><br/><p>Miserable groans sounded and there were many Yu Family experts who threw away the swords in their hands as they held onto their bleeding eyes. Many of the Yu Family experts rolled off the roof and those who didn\u2019t roll off jumped up to pitifully avoid the incoming hidden weapons while cursing incessantly.</p><br/><p>A hole was immediately formed in the encirclement of the Yu Family experts!</p><br/><p>This opportunity can\u2019t be missed!</p><br/><p>Even though they knew that there was an expert aiding them in the dark, this wasn\u2019t the time for them to exchange greetings!</p><br/><p>As long as they had the chance to stay alive, who would be willing to die?!</p><br/><p>Meng WuQing held onto both his brothers and with his fastest possible speed, he dashed out from the opening and was forty to fifty feet away!</p><br/><p>The archers of the Yu Family members nocked their bows and right when they were about to fire, a copper coin shot towards them with a \u2018weng\u2019 and more than twenty bows were sliced into half by the sharp copper coin.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brat, you dare!\u201d Yu ManLou roared and his hiding figure shot out from his hiding place. Before the crowd could even blink, Yu ManLou had already covered more than a hundred feet and arrived at the bush beside the wall. At the same time, his palm struck down with the majesty of lightning descending from the heavens!</p><br/><p>It struck towards the bush and the shadow hiding within it!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

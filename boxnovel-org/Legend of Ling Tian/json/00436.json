He didn\u2019t purposefully increase his volume, but this soft reply was heard clearly by the 40 to 50 odd men around. It was as though they had received an imperial pardon. All their faces immediately showed traces of joy, and in fact, gratitude instead of anger as they picked up their injured comrades and sped off.</p><br/><p>Upon leaving some of them even bowed towards him, saying, \u201cThank you young noble Ling for sparing our lives, your magnanimity will be repaid!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the group disappearing over the horizon, Ling Tian quietly stood there with a sarcastic smile on his lips as he enunciated, \u201cThis is human character!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy so?\u201d Li Xue furrowed her pretty brows as she walked to stand beside him. Looking at the scene of blood and gore, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little nauseous, her face turning pale. While her hands were bloodied with the lives of many, such a scene was something she had never seen even in her past life.</p><br/><p>Seeing Li Xue\u2019s condition, Ling Tian smiled as he replied, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we walk as we talk. Let\u2019s find a place to recuperate first.\u201d As he spoke, he moved forward, throwing the sword he snatched from one of the ten experts carelessly on the ground. As it landed, the sword shattered into a multitude of pieces, totally unrecognizable. This sword had no special properties imbued within it during its making, and it was sustained purely by Ling Tian\u2019s strong internal energy. Now that Ling Tian had withdrawn his energy, the sword naturally reached the end of its life, totally disintegrating!</p><br/><p>Li Xue shot Ling Tian a look that seemed to indicate that she had other thoughts, before moving to catch up to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mentioned just now that this was human character. What do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were originally enemies and couldn\u2019t share the same sky. But because I spared their lives, not only did they not have the dignity of a martial artist and feel humiliated, they were even thankful that they could leave and expressed their gratitude towards me. This, I find extremely interesting.\u201d Ling Tian slowly began. \u201cI don\u2019t term this sort of warrior as a martial artist, but rather trash! This is because they don\u2019t even possess the hot-bloodedness of a farmer who tends to his fields day after day! Thus, I let them go. To have such people in the Yu Family is a good thing for us.\u201d Ling Tian let out a meaningful smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if they would rather die than retreat? What if they were those sort of strong and determined men, would you really be willing to cut them down? Or would you be in admiration of them and let them go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian suddenly stopped short and turned back to stare into her eyes as he snapped, \u201cLi Xue, you must drill this into your head. I said before that I\u2019m no gentlemen, nor am I some great hero! These are my heartfelt thoughts! An enemy will forever be an enemy! No matter if he\u2019s some great hero or some valiant warrior, ultimately they will be people that can threaten my life! I can admire and respect them, but when it\u2019s time to kill, I will not have any intention to let them off! Doing so is akin to leaving a tumor unchecked, letting them plot against you and your loved ones! Such an enemy can be said to be the most frightening one you can find! For a bunch of cowards, you can ignore, but for a warrior, so long as you leave him with a breath of life, there\u2019s always the possibility he will inflict tremendous damage towards you one day, which will leave you with irrevocable regret!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeroes pitying heroes will only ever appear in stories. If they become reality, then that would be a tragedy.\u201d Ling Tian concluded.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like your past? A cripple exploding a great portion of the elites of the two biggest clans? Are you that kind of valiant warrior?!\u201d Li Xue stuck out her tongue as she jested. During this period of time together, following the release of their heart\u2019s burdens, their topic about the past lives was not as taboo as before, and thus Li Xue dared to bring up this matter to tease him.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian gave a meaningful smile in return. \u201cThat differs to some extent. I wasn\u2019t killed because I was meant to be used as a form of humiliation, as well as to form a bait of sorts. This was to allow those who helped me to be punished as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue silently thought about it, before smiling to herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was merely lamenting just now. If we had never experienced hardships and suffered, we would probably be like those people just now, running with our tails tucked between our legs.\u201d Ling Tian mused out loud. \u201cAs the saying goes, \u2018A portion of hard work will reap a consequent portion of benefits\u2019. This is very reasonable, and the ancient sayings have never lied to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. In this world, if you don\u2019t work hard, then you only can let others step on your pride, forever remaining at the bottom rung of the ladder.\u201d Li Xue lamented as she sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong!\u201d Ling Tian laughingly scolded. \u201cIt\u2019s not just this world, even our old Earth also had the same principles! There\u2019s no difference anywhere we go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you are living on the bottommost rung, you still can use effort to succeed.\u201d Ling Tian resolutely spoke. \u201cA person\u2019s life has always been about starting from the very bottom and fighting their way up for their entire lives. While one might not always succeed, but they at least can achieve something! And that is by allowing his or her descendants to borrow from his strengths, to stand on his shoulders to reach greater heights so that one day they might extricate themselves from the bottom. So long as they work as hard, there will be a place higher up for them. Even if their children can\u2019t, grandchildren, great-grandchildren\u2026 there will be one generation which will succeed, and that\u2019s the essence of \u2018where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s a way\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re trying to say that if every generation works as hard as the one before,\u201d Li Xue laughed out, \u201cthat one day, someone will stand at the top of the ladder. So long as one doesn\u2019t stop working, their future is limitless! Is that the meaning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPrecisely!\u201d Ling Tian solemnly replied. \u201cThere will always be people that tell their children, \u2018my life is gone, all my hopes are pinned on you\u2019. For parents like that, they have basically given up on themselves and thus are destined not to progress further. If you wish for your children to seek out a good future, you have to first start from yourself!\u201d Ling Tian let out a sarcastic smile.</p><br/><p>Li Xue, however, retorted, \u201cBut in every society, there will definitely be people on the lower rung.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian assented as he laughed out, \u201cAs such, only those who succeed through putting in the effort can enjoy the fruits of their labor! For example, you and me!\u201d</p><br/><p>As they conversed, the two of them had long left the mountainous regions, and in front of them came the gushing of water, which revealed to be a small creek. Ling Tian nodded his head in approval as he spoke, \u201cHere will do. I\u2019ll help you to treat your injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue suddenly turned bashful, as her cheeks flamed up. \u201cI can handle my injuries by myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face sank, \u201cYou might be able to treat those at your chest, but those in your left shoulder and on your back? Don\u2019t make so much noise! I still have to rely on you to treat mine later. I really dislike having scars on my body. They\u2019ll spoil this perfect body of mine that I\u2019ve built up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s eyes lit up as she grabbed the chance to say, \u201cHow about I\u2019ll help you treat your wounds first? After all, your injuries are more serious than mine! I\u2026 I don\u2019t really mind having scars on my body!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t!\u201d Ling Tian scolded. \u201cHow would I not know that your injuries are more severe than mine? How long would it have to take for you to finish treating me? Can you injuries even wait that long?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Li Xue still being stubborn, Ling Tian could only sigh and say, \u201cXue\u2019er, I\u2019m your brother!\u201d And adding on a fierce tone, he continued, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you need to be so polite about me treating your injuries? Don\u2019t forget, I saw you in your birthday suit when you were young!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue blustered with a totally red face, \u201cThat was the past! I don\u2019t have any relations with you now, I\u2019m called Li Xue, not Xue\u2019er!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian really flared up at this point. He snapped, \u201cStop giving me rubbish, past and present, there\u2019s no difference!\u201d As he spoke, he unceremoniously pulled Li Xue over to him, stretching his hands out to undress her.</p><br/><p>Li Xue let out a lovable moan, as she snapped her eyelids shut out of embarrassment.</p><br/><p>To think that she didn\u2019t even put up a token resistance, this was totally out of Ling Tian\u2019s expectation. However, following that he started to feel as though something was seriously wrong about this!</p><br/><p>In front of him was a girl who resembled a flower in full bloom! The moment Ling Tian saw the spotlessly white corset and faintly observed the proud and unyielding lines and peaks underneath it that would cause a person\u2019s imagination to shoot towards the high heavens, as well as touched the snow white skin, carrying a tinge of heat, passing through from his fingertips straight to his heart, his face immediately turned red as well. It was then he realized the problem.</p><br/><p>Seeing Li Xue still with her eyes shut, and her face completely red with her body slightly trembling, Ling Tian only felt an unbearable heat slowly rise up inside his body. Blaming his own lack of self-control, he angrily gave himself a tight slap on his face, the sound echoing crisply around.</p><br/><p>Li Xue couldn\u2019t help but open her eyes and ask, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing, just a mosquito.\u201d Ling Tian could only raggedly turn his face away and dunk a piece of clean cloth in the mountain stream. Injecting his internal energy, the surrounding water in the stream started to bubble as steam rose, and as he pulled the cloth from the water, he used his other hand to unravel the final chest wrap on Li Xue\u2019s body, causing her snow white flesh to jump and bob out!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian swallowed his saliva with difficulty, before focusing his eyes on the bloodied wound. He forcibly restrained his emotion as he slowly dabbed on it.</p><br/><p>With her eyes closed, Li Xue let out a comfortable sigh from her nose, and suddenly started giggling as she asked, \u201cTian\u2019ge, is my body good to look at? Is it better than my previous life?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The calm inner mental state that Ling Tian spent so long to achieve was quickly thrown into chaos once again. A womanly scent could be smelled with every breath he took, and all of his raging desires were hooked up with a single sentence from Li Xue, almost making him unable to hold back.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian didn\u2019t know whether he should be angry, amused, or uncomfortable, and in the end settled by slapping her pert buttocks as he exclaimed, \u201cBehave! Don\u2019t speak nonsense!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo crude! Oh, I almost forgot, you\u2019ve never seen my grown-up body before!\u201d Li Xue pouted before reluctantly shutting her mouth. It was only after Ling Tian had finished treating her three slash wounds that she suddenly laughed out, snorting as she spoke, \u201cTian\u2019ge, you\u2019re so cute when your face is red! It\u2019s even cuter than your past life!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

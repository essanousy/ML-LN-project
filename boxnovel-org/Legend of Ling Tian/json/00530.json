He could not help but tremble as he felt his whole body turning cold.</p><br/><p>Things are truly bad this time!</p><br/><p>Shui QianJiang and Shui QianHai who were still arguing previously disappeared with a swoosh sound. If they weren\u2019t going to run now, when should they run?</p><br/><p>At this moment, the startled Die\u2019er used all of her strength and let out a loud shriek!</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan lowered his head with a pale expression. Apart from the slight rising and falling of his chest, there wasn\u2019t a single sign of life! With his chest being smashed by the medicine pot, his ribs were completely fractured and he could no longer move. The moment he tried to move, death would probably come next. The situation had actually developed to such a horrible extent!</p><br/><p>Ling Chi was drenched in sweat as he continued to put out his inner qi. If Shui QianHuan died right here, all of Ling Chen\u2019s plans would definitely be ruined! At this moment, Ling Chi was extremely anxious!</p><br/><p>A commotion sounded from the outside and Shui QianRou was returning excitedly from her conversation with the First Elder\u2026</p><br/><p>When Shui QianRou saw her brother\u2019s pitiful appearance, the anger that she had suppressed for a long time exploded like a volcano, \u201cWho did that? Did an enemy attack us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chi stood up emotionlessly with sweat still all over his face as he saw Shui QianRou\u2019s arrival. He had already exhausted all of his inner qi and spent a large amount of pure inner qi before finally being able to protect Shui QianHuan\u2019s final vitality, preventing him from dying on the spot. But despite that, Shui QianHuan\u2019s situation was still not optimistic. His breathing was weak and it looked as though he would stop breathing at any moment.</p><br/><p>The First Elder was astounded by the sight in front of him! While Shui QianHuan was currently a sinner of his family, he was heavily injured after all and was still the son of the current Family Head. Right after they brought reinforcements to Heavenly Star, something like this had actually happened. It was just that this did not seem like an enemy attack at all!</p><br/><p>Could it be that the men he brought almost beat Shui QianHuan to death?!</p><br/><p>If this matter happened during a normal sparring match, then it was explainable and there would still be a chance for them to defend themselves. However, Shui QianHuan was obviously seriously injured and incapable of defending himself at the moment. However, he was still injured to such an extent! The despicable actions of the culprit really made one\u2019s hair stand in anger!</p><br/><p>Die\u2019er who was in a complete daze finally snapped back to her senses and she threw herself by Shui QianHuan\u2019s side, explaining to Shui QianHuan everything which had happened. The anger on Shui QianRou\u2019s face grew thicker and thicker and after suppressing the anger in her heart, she carefully inspected Shui QianHuan\u2019s injuries. The situation in front of her could not be any worse and Shui QianRou felt her head turning dizzy. Her body shook unsteadily and she almost passed out at that moment.</p><br/><p>Her brother\u2019s internal injuries were already severe and his internal organs were shaken up again. Furthermore, his ribs were also fractured and his life was truly like a candle flickering in the wind. If they did not help Shui QianHuan connect his bones and avoid touching his injuries while trying to protect his lifeforce with inner qi, Shui QianHuan would probably be able to survive for a few more days but the outcome would be unknown. But if they were to attempt to connect his bones right now, Shui QianHuan would definitely be unable to survive such a large operation!</p><br/><p>But if they didn\u2019t connect his ribs and allowed them to remain fractured in his chest, the pain Shui QianHuan would suffer would be worse than death! After Shui QianHuan was injured, he already had difficulties breathing. However, with all of his ribs fractured now, every breath he took would be accompanied by the torture of going through all eighteen levels of hell! Staying alive in such a manner without knowing how long more he can stay alive. If that was the case, what was the point of him staying alive any longer?</p><br/><p>To the present Shui QianHuan, death was perhaps the biggest grace and pleasure!</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan\u2019s injuries had deteriorated to the point where even a deity would find it difficult to treat!</p><br/><p>What choice should she make?</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan sat down beside her brother with low spirits and tears flowed down her cheeks. At this moment, she was completely disheartened! A long while later, she collapsed onto the ground and began bawling her eyes out!</p><br/><p>The First Elder walked into the room and roared, \u201cWhere is Shui QianHu? Come out now for this old man!\u201d He was extremely clear that only those three degenerates would dare to heavily injure Shui QianHuan in such a manner. At the same time, the room was in a complete mess and Shui QianHu\u2019s figure was nowhere to be seen. Even both Shui QianJiang and Shui QianHai had also disappeared completely\u2026</p><br/><p>The other elders walked in from the outside and let out a unified sigh. All of them were extremely appalled by what had happened!</p><br/><p>Following a light coughing sound, Shui QianHuan gradually woke up and opened his eyes with difficulty. Looking at his sister kneeling down in front of him and bawling her eyes out, Shui QianHuan was visibly agitated. Despite looking as though he wanted to say something, not a single word could leave his mouth. His eyeballs then spun around and he looked towards Ling Chi\u2019s emotionless face with a pleading look.</p><br/><p>Ling Chi felt his heart shake. Shui QianHuan was pleading for death!</p><br/><p>He was pleading towards this only outsider!</p><br/><p>After going through countless of bloody slaughters, Ling Chi could naturally understand the intentions behind Shui QianHuan\u2019s gaze! Since there wasn\u2019t a hope to stay alive, Shui QianHuan would rather plead for death so he could suffer less!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou lifted his head up and shook her head heavily while wailing uncontrollably. Shui QianHuan\u2019s condition was far too severe and Shui QianRou did not dare to touch him at all. She could only plead with tears rolling down her eyes, \u201c\u2026 brother, please\u2026 please please please\u2026 please continue living on\u2026 please hold on and don\u2019t give up\u2026 please don\u2019t leave me behind alone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Shui QianHuan\u2019s gaze, Ling Chi\u2019s heart was stirred. Even though I didn\u2019t kill Bo Ren, Bo Ren died because of me! 1 While Ling Chi did not have a single shred of goodwill towards Shui QianHuan and had some prejudice against him because of Ling Chen, Ling Chi\u2019s heart was indeed stirred at this moment!</p><br/><p>He decided\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Chi took two steps forward and whispered into Shui QianHuan\u2019s ears softly but clearly, \u201cI understand what you mean but you cannot despair at this moment. This is not the time for you to go to the yellow springs road.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan\u2019s eyes were filled with misery and urgency as he let out soft groaning sounds. Despite being unable to say a single word, it was obvious that Shui QianHuan was begging for death.</p><br/><p>Ling Chi then said softly, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you want to kill Shui QianHu personally? This is probably your last regret at this moment right? We are both men and there isn\u2019t a need for you to say anything more. Both of us know that it is impossible for you to carry on living but I believe that you will definitely be able to last for another two more days. I will let Shui QianHu die in your hands! Don\u2019t you want to see him die? Don\u2019t you want him to die in your hands? Are you willing to die before your enemy? Die before a scoundrel like him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan\u2019s breathing became ragged and his eyes lit up with a trace of gratitude. At the same time, a trace of blood trailed down from his lips and he trembled for a moment before falling unconscious.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou shrieked and Ling Chi let out a sigh. At the same time, he looked at the unconscious Shui QianHuan and said firmly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry! I will let Shui QianHu die in your hands. I will then send you on your final journey personally! As long as you fulfill your final wish, I will not let you suffer any more pain!\u201d Ling Chi then added on in his heart, All of your pain was caused by me and while I did not want such an outcome, an accident still happened. I am sorry, Shui QianHuan!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou lifted her head up and grit her teeth as she looked at Ling Chi, \u201cWhat do you mean by that? Are you really able to accomplish that? Is there a point to coax my brother like that? Is there a meaning to do that?! While I really want to thank you, is this truly good for my brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chi looked at her calmly before pointing to Die\u2019er and Shui Seven, \u201cYou can ask them what the words I said mean.\u201d He then spread out his arms and a pure inner qi wrapped around Shui QianHuan\u2019s body. He then let out a soft grunt before lifting both man and chair up. Ling Chi then walked into the room slowly without the unconscious Shui QianHuan feeling a single thing. After a short seven to eight steps, Ling Chi\u2019s face was already completely drenched in sweat!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s face was filled with grief but a trace of gratitude could be seen in her eyes. However, it was quickly replaced with hatred and she barked, \u201cCatch the three of them and bring them back immediately! I must kill them to take revenge for my brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>A look of a headache could be seen on the six elders\u2019 face and they all avoided Shui QianRou\u2019s gaze. The First Elder then sighed, \u201cLittle Princess, please control yourself. Cough cough, before this incident is fully investigated, it is best for you to not act rashly. We should discuss this matter further.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shui QianRou turned around in anger, \u201cFirst Elder, now that things have developed to such an extent, you are still going to say such words? How do you expect me to control myself? What else is still unclear?! Discuss this matter further? How can such words even leave your mouth?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The First Elder\u2019s face turned red and he said softly, \u201cMay Princess Rou quell your anger. It is best for us to invite a physician to treat young master first. As for chasing after Shui QianHu, cough cough, there are still many other things before us and with the important matters at hand, it is best for us to\u2026 delay this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou fell silent for a short while before saying with grit teeth. She then enunciated every word slowly, \u201cI understand!\u201d She raised her head up, \u201cWhat you are trying to say is that the men you brought would not listen to my orders. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything is for the family! The family\u2019s benefits are the most important!\u201d the First Elder said solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily? FAMILY?!\u201d Shui QianRou cried, \u201cHahaha\u2026 family! What is a family? I finally understand. I finally understand!\u201d She then stopped laughing and said in a low voice, \u201cI will not use anyone from the Shui Family! But I will definitely let the three of them die! You guys just wait! If I do not take revenge for my brother, I, Shui QianRou, will not be a human!\u201d After she said those words, she walked straight into Shui QianHuan\u2019s room without looking back. At this moment, her skinny figure seemed so desolate and lonely but yet heroic!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

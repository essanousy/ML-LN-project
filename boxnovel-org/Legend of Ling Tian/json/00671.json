In two days?! How would he be able to accomplish that?!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Jian, just what is going on? Why did young noble shorten our deadline from five days to two?\u201d Ling Chi jumped up and asked with disbelief, \u201cIsn\u2019t young noble forcing us to our death? Can you plead to young noble to give us a few more days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face darkened and he did not say a thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Five days is already very little. Now that he is only going to give us two days. Haiz\u2026\u201d Ling Feng said bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think young noble must have been agitated by something.\u201d Ling Yun who was by the side remarked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is probably brother Jian who agitated young noble.\u201d Ling Lei added on without reservation, \u201cLook at our brother Jian\u2019s pitiful appearance. Apart from our young noble, probably no one else would be able to reduce him to such a pathetic state!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other four nodded their heads in agreement like chickens pecking on rice. Their eyes were then fixed onto Ling Jian as they asked, \u201cBrother Jian, just how did you agitate young noble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian stood up in exasperation and hollered in rage, \u201cAll of you scram and do what all of you have to! If all of you aren\u2019t able to find anything in two days and young noble bestows me with eighteen concubines, I will definitely give five of them to each of you! If eighteen isn\u2019t enough to go around, I will personally add a couple more to ensure that there are sufficient ladies to go around!\u201d</p><br/><p>Swoosh!</p><br/><p>The five immediately disappeared.</p><br/><p>How unlucky, of all times to daydream I actually chose to daydream when young noble was venting his frustrations\u2026 Isn\u2019t this no different from seeking trouble?! Ling Jian touched the injuries on his face and let out a long sigh. In the end, he also disappeared with a flash.</p><br/><p>Outside the window, the entire sky was filled with stars.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled with delight as he jumped out from the window of the assassin\u2019s courtyard while muttering to himself, \u201cI shall let you smile! I shall let you smile at this young noble. Hehehe, after venting my anger, my mood is finally much better\u2026\u201d Young noble Ling Tian laughed sneakily.</p><br/><p>After teasing Ling Jian and the others, Ling Tian was in an exceptionally good mood and he sang all the way back to his room. But the moment he opened his room door, his face turned dark.</p><br/><p>The entire room was actually empty!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was a little depressed. He had already made eye signals to Yu BingYan and Ling Chen in the afternoon and after a long discussion with the two, the faces of the two ladies flushed red. They had obviously agreed to me already! Why have they disappeared now? Ling Tian who was anticipating the two beauties in his arms the moment he enters the room was puzzled.</p><br/><p>My goodness! If even these two gentle ladies dare to go against my happiness, how will I spend my future days? Little young noble Ling hasn\u2019t had a good workout for such a long time already! Ling Tian stormed out of the room angrily and went to search for the two ladies.</p><br/><p>He first went to Yu BingYan\u2019s room but there wasn\u2019t anybody there. Ling Tian did not stay for the slightest bit of time and went for his next target. Could it be that they are waiting in Ling Chen\u2019s room? Ling Tian smiled to himself happily. If that\u2019s the case, it doesn\u2019t seem too bad either.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s guess wasn\u2019t wrong and the two ladies were waiting in Ling Chen\u2019s room indeed. Furthermore, not only Ling Chen and Yu BingYan were there. Even Li Xue, Xiao YanXue, Shui QianRou, and Princess JiaoYue were around. The six beauties gathered together as though they were prepared to talk through the night\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was immediately filled with anxiousness.</p><br/><p>Looking at the scene before him, it was obvious to him that Li Xue had definitely heard what he said to Ling Chen and Yu BingYan. It was no wonder that lass left the room with a teasing look in her eyes.</p><br/><p>In the room, the other four ladies were chatting merrily but Ling Chen and Yu BingYan both looked at each other with anxiousness in their eyes. However, they were helpless in the face of their four sisters. Thus, they could only accompany them helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Little sister Chen and BingYan seem pretty distracted? Do the two of you have something else to attend to?\u201d Li Xue chuckled and asked, \u201cIf the two of you really have something else, I wonder what it is?\u201d</p><br/><p>The faces of Ling Chen and Yu BingYan turned red and they shook their heads, \u201cNo no no, we don\u2019t have anything to attend to.\u201d They couldn\u2019t possibly say that they had to warm their young noble\u2019s bed right? How would they be able to say such words?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, since the two of you do not have anything on, let us continue chatting for a while more. Where were we?\u201d Li Xue said with a serious expression on her face, \u201cOf course, if the two of you have anything urgent to attend do, the two of you may take your leave.\u201d All the other ladies echoed, \u201cWe are all sisters after all, there isn\u2019t a need to stand on ceremony.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan and Ling Chen began coughing dryly and stuttered, \u201cNothing, nothing. We really have nothing. Everyone can carry on chatting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue had a cunning smile. \u201cIt is rare for us sisters to have such a good conversation. If that\u2019s the case, why don\u2019t we talk through the night? When we are tired later on, we can just sleep together to improve our sisterly ties.\u201d Shui QianRou and Xiao YanXue cried out in agreement.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and Yu BingYan\u2019s faces changed color as they looked at each other.</p><br/><p>The two ladies could only remain anxious but could not open their mouths to say a thing. Outside the window, Ling Tian could only stomp his feet in frustration but was entirely helpless.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian gnashed his teeth in anger. He had never wished to take Li Xue as badly as he did now! Leaving this lass to do as she wished would be like placing a ticking bomb in his harem. If they would \u2018improve their relationship\u2019 a few times a month, Ling Tian would probably be angered to the point he turned impotent!</p><br/><p>The plan to take Li Xue in must definitely be expedited! Ling Tian clenched his teeth. I must definitely let this lass get a taste of little young noble Ling\u2019s prowess! At that time, I will definitely make sure to keep her in bed for three days! Hehehe\u2026</p><br/><p>Just when he was fantasizing in his heart, a shriek could be heard from within, \u201cAssassin!\u201d Following that, the window was opened and a large bucket of water came splashing over.</p><br/><p>The moment Ling Tian heard the word \u2018assassin\u2019, he immediately became alert and sent out his divine sense to scan the surroundings. If any one of the six ladies in the room were to be injured, Ling Tian would definitely die from heartache. How would he dare to be careless?</p><br/><p>However, he never expected a bucket of water to greet him just when he was scanning the surroundings. Being caught off guard, Ling Tian was drenched from head to toe. All their ladies made their arrival and Li Xue held an iron basin in her hands. With an agile figure, she jumped out and smashed the basin down on Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>Dang! A resounding gong sounded.</p><br/><p>What a powerful iron basin! It was definitely capable of being listed as one of the seven divine weapons! With its ability to launch a successful ambush on the peerless expert Ling Tian, it was definitely sufficient to have a place in the pugilistic world!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face was full of black lines with water dripping down from his clothes.</p><br/><p>It better not be leg washing water\u2026</p><br/><p>All the ladies burst out in laughter and hurriedly helped Ling Tian to clean up. Some of them rushed to take a clean towel and the others rushed to find some clean clothes for him.</p><br/><p>Li Xue had a shocked look on her face (It was definitely feigned without a doubt) as she grumbled, \u201cI say young noble Ling, what are you doing? Why are you acting so sneakily in your own courtyard? Even if you want to eavesdrop on us, shouldn\u2019t you be a little more careful? I thought that you were an assassin and attacked without thinking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was angered to the point he was rendered speechless. Would you grab a metal basin if I was an assassin? Would you spray a bucket full of water on an assassin before smashing him on the head? I am afraid that you would greet me with a knife if I was an assassin.</p><br/><p>Looking at the feigned expression of shock on Li Xue\u2019s face together with the concealed look of delight in her eyes, Ling Tian dove into bed and hid under the blanket.</p><br/><p>Too embarrassing! This is truly too embarrassing!</p><br/><p>All the ladies burst out into laughter.</p><br/><p>A doubtful voice suddenly sounded, \u201cEh? Why would young noble Ling be eavesdropping at little sister Chen\u2019s room instead of attending to his other matters? Little sister Chen looked extremely distracted from just now. Could it be that we disturbed little sister Chen\u2019s plans?\u201d These words were said by Li Xue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Elder sister Chen looked extremely anxious to leave previously. No wonder! Right, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for elder sister Chen to be anxious, but why would little sister Yan\u2026\u201d This voice belonged to Shui QianRou.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! That big lecher and bad person!\u201d This voice was filled with a tinge of jealousy. It belonged to Xiao YanXue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it\u2019s best for you to change out of your wet clothes first, lest you catch a cold.\u201d This voice belonged to Princess JiaoYue.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and Yu BingYan lowered their heads with their necks completely red. They were too embarrassed to even say a single word.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let us leave quickly and not spoil some individual\u2019s plans. This fellow is truly a vengeful individual and may remember it for his entire life.\u201d Someone stuck out her tongue mischievously and all the ladies scattered.</p><br/><p>A series of laughter could be heard going further and further away. Only Ling Chen and Yu BingYan were left behind in the room. Both the two ladies were embarrassed to the point they did not even know where to put their hands.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stuck his tongue out and grunted, \u201cHmph, don\u2019t be happy too quickly. I will let all of you know this young noble\u2019s prowess someday.\u201d He then looked at Ling Chen and Yu BingYan while chuckling, \u201cMy two beauties, hehehe, it is now our turn. My clothes are completely drenched and I have to take them all off so I don\u2019t catch a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian truly started taking off his clothes the moment he said those words!</p><br/><p>The two ladies were exasperated.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s thick skin was truly unparalleled. Even after meeting with such an embarrassing event, his lust still wasn\u2019t quenched\u2026</p><br/><p>The two ladies clicked their tongues together and turned around. As though they suddenly thought of something, their faces began to burn.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian burst out laughing and stood up. All of a sudden, the room turned dark and the candles were blown out. Following that, a soft squeal could be heard from the two ladies. As for what happened after\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s figure landed lightly on the tiles like a drifting leaf. Despite the night wind blowing, his black robes did not flutter the slightest bit in the wind.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Jian\u2019s figure seemed to have been melded together with the darkness. Even if someone walked past him, they may not notice that someone was hiding in the midst of this silent darkness.</p><br/><p>Of course, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to walk past Ling Jian coincidentally because\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Jian was at the peak of the Smoky Thea Tower and it was the second highest point in Sky Bearing apart from the imperial palace. At the same time, the various envoys of the different places were also situated near the Smoky Thea Tower. Ling Jian\u2019s senses spread out like a huge net and nothing could escape his senses! This was the evidence that Ling Jian\u2019s cultivation had reached the peak of XianTian! At this moment, Ling Jian\u2019s cultivation wouldn\u2019t be too far away from Yu ManLou or the late Shui WuBo!</p><br/><p>With young noble Ling purposely venting his anger on his subordinates, his subordinates could only try their best to gather evidence! It was a pity that they did not have any rewards! In truth, Ling Jian knew that even if they returned without finding anything when the deadline was up, young noble Ling would not do anything to them. However, they were not in the habit of disappointing Ling Tian and even if there wasn\u2019t any hope, they would work hard to the very end!</p><br/><p>Since they did not have any hope, their best choice would be for them lay in wait! That was the best choice they had in their helplessness!</p><br/><p>The moment the Yu or Xiao Family made any strange movements, Ling Jian would be able to arrange for men to follow them from the very first moment! With the special tracing medicine that they previously spread during the chaotic battle in the Smoky Thea Tower, they definitely had the chance to accurately follow everyone!</p><br/><p>It was midnight and Ling Jian had already been standing straight without moving for a full four hours. However, he still had no reward!</p><br/><p>Not too far away, the tower head of the Smoky Thea Tower, Gu XiYan was making some arrangements. Further away, Xiao FengYang had just returned and the sound of dissatisfaction from the Above Heavens elder could be heard.</p><br/><p>There was also the sound of Yu ManTian bellowing with rage as he returned and the ten experts cursing under their breaths. All of these had entered Ling Jian\u2019s ears as he carefully scrutinized what he heard.</p><br/><p>While he was too far away and couldn\u2019t hear the words clearly, this mysterious feeling made Ling Jian feel as though he held the entire world in his hands.</p><br/><p>Is this the realm of minute subtleties which young noble mentioned? I have actually entered into such a mysterious realm?</p><br/><p>It was deep in the night.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian\u2019s deafening snores could be heard.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian could not help but chuckle to himself. This old friend of theirs was truly free of worries. To think that he is actually able to sleep so soundly in the territory of the Yu Family\u2019s biggest enemy. Ling Jian was truly in admiration! Even if a volcano were to erupt, this Third Master Yu will probably be still sleeping soundly.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, alarm bells rang in Ling Jian\u2019s mind. Gathering his attention, he cleared his head to focus.</p><br/><p>Two ghostly like figures shot out from the Yu Family\u2019s courtyard. After exchanging a glance in the darkness, their figures disappeared into the darkness.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s senses were immediately locked onto the two and he used his divine sense to \u2018see\u2019 the two of them suspiciously going once around the Smoky Thea Tower before returning to their courtyard. Following that, a long period of silence followed.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Jian could clearly sense that there were no less than ten powerful divine senses spreading out and performing a carpet search of the surrounding hundred feet. The three souls and seven bodies of the Yu Family were obviously attempting to test the defenses of the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian sneered in his heart. Before he came out, Ling Jian had already made the arrangements to withdraw all the spies in the surroundings and replaced them with members from his First Pavilion. Any ordinary spy would not have any use in the face of a XianTian expert and their only use would be to alert the enemies.</p><br/><p>In a flash, the ten figures appeared on the top of the roof before splitting apart into ten directions and disappearing into the darkness.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian remained rooted to his spot and did not make a single move while he praised in his heart, The three souls and seven bodies are truly wily old foxes. After sending out two individuals to put up an act and scout out the place, they still used a deception tactic before leaving for their true objective! They are truly extremely cautious!</p><br/><p>However, the more careful they were, the larger their ambitions and target!</p><br/><p>Just when Ling Jian was about to give chase, he felt that something was amiss again!</p><br/><p>It turned out that a black figure suddenly returned like a shooting star and landed on the peak of the Smoky Thea Tower. He was only a mere ten feet away from Ling Jian\u2019s hiding place! This black figure was one of the ten who had just left!</p><br/><p>This black figure stood atop the tower and looked around without making a move!</p><br/><p>To think that he was actually careful to such an extent!</p><br/><p>However, if he was standing there, how could Ling Jian make a move? Even with Ling Jian\u2019s martial arts, it was impossible for him to make a move without being detected at this distance!</p><br/><p>Now what?!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian cursed in his heart. While he would definitely be able to take the figure in front of him down in a single move, that would inevitably alert his enemies. But if he did not get rid of the figure before him and give chase, wouldn\u2019t it ruin his plans?</p><br/><p>Of the ten who went out, one returned and there were another nine who needed to be chased! If they ended up missing the true target because of this, Ling Jian would definitely regret it greatly!</p><br/><p>Just as he was feeling anxious, he heard a soft \u2018kacha\u2019 sound from about a hundred feet away. That was the direction where Ling Chi was at!</p><br/><p>The black robed figure at the top of the roof also heard the sound and charged over immediately. Before that black figure even landed on the ground, he had already unsheathed his sword as though he was facing a powerful enemy!</p><br/><p>A soft meow could be heard and a black cat jumped out from the corner of the alley. That black figure spat out a mouthful of spit and cursed under his breath.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Jian was already 200 feet away! In the world today, Ling Jian\u2019s movement techniques were definitely ranked among the top five!</p><br/><p>This black cat that jumped out from the alley was naturally thrown out by Ling Chi.</p><br/><p>Ling Chi, Ling Feng, Ling Yun and the rest stood silently as Ling Jian\u2019s figure flashed past them. Without stopping, Ling Jian gave a few hand signals to them. The few of them immediately understood what Ling Jian meant and melded into the darkness.</p><br/><p>On top of the Smoky Thea Tower, the black figure was still looking around carefully with his sword gleaming in the moonlight. However, he did not know that he had already brushed past the most frightening asura. Had Ling Chi\u2019s black cat appeared a moment later, Ling Jian would have definitely taken his life in an instant.</p><br/><p>A single move was sufficient!</p></div>\n</div>"}

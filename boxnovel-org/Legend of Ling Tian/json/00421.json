This lass in front of him actually possessed martial arts far surpassing himself, and from her movement techniques, it seemed as though her strength was close to Ling Tian himself! However, this person had never been heard of or seen before. Since when did Ling Tian have such an outstanding subordinate?!</p><br/><p>Could this be the hidden strength of Ling Tian himself? How many more such people did Ling Tian actually have? DongFang JingLei was very clear that there were four other outstanding men who had accompanied him when he had engaged the 400,000 strong troops of Northern Wei. This news had shaken the entire continent, and despite all their efforts, no one had managed to uncover their identities. It was as though they had disappeared once again after the battle was over!</p><br/><p>However, none of the major powers dared to drop their guards because of this. In fact, everyone came to the consensus that the four other horsemen were probably Ling Tian\u2019s subordinates! For this type of subordinate, so long as any family had even a single one it would probably cause many of their competitors to be in shock. But now, Ling Tian actually had four of them! No doubt this caused universal shock to all who knew him!</p><br/><p>The most excessive part was the fact that if any family were to possess an expert of such caliber, the news would have long been leaked out since such people were akin to the gleam of sharp war weapons and unable to be hidden. However, not only did Ling Tian manage to possess four of them, but he had managed to keep the whole thing under wraps without leaking a single detail! And furthermore he hid them once again after utilizing them for the mission! In the vast world, no one knew where had the four of them disappeared to! This concept was unimaginable to them!</p><br/><p>Having four such experts was not even the end. Now there actually came along this mysterious blue-robed lass! As far as DongFang JingLei was aware, there was no woman in this original troop of four! Furthermore, the Ling Family Courtyard in Sky Bearing was definitely the place where many experts hid, not to mention the mysterious and formidable Ling Chen!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian, just how many different sources of strength do you have?!</p><br/><p>Could it be that Ling Tian\u2019s military might has actually surpassed the Yu Family? This thought rose unbidden in DongFang JingLei\u2019s mind all of a sudden, and he shivered uncontrollably at this nonsensical thought!</p><br/><p>It seems like he would need to properly consider the idea of working together with Ling Tian. As the skies grew ever darker, DongFang JingLei\u2019s figure slowly merged with the darkness as he sat in his tent in deep thought.</p><br/><p>From afar, on a bare hilltop, Ling Tian stood with his hands behind his back, looking at the silvery galaxy in the distance, and his eyes were likewise gleaming. It was not known what he was thinking, and the night wind blew gently on his clothes, making him seem like an immortal gazing at the world if one looked at him from afar.</p><br/><p>Wordlessly, a slim blue figure appeared beside him and stood there accompanying him without a single word. She too gazed at the starry sky, as though there was something interesting about it.</p><br/><p>Even after a long while, both people did not make a single sound.</p><br/><p>The moon had already illuminated the dark sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you pass all these years?\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s voice sounded dreamy, as though traveling from within a dream.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Li Xue let out a fuzzy smile, \u201cAre you showing me care and concern?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian turned around, his eyes blazing, \u201cDid you think that my concern for you is not enough? If you didn\u2019t turn up, I would of course be less than bothered, but since you\u2019ve already come over, how can I as your elder brother not even bother to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs an elder brother?\u201d Li Xue let out a cold laugh as she spoke in an agonized tone, \u201cFrom the past to the present, when have you treated me as your sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore we were ten, Xue\u2019er used to be the closest sister to me.\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s voice was similarly laced with pain as he replied, \u201cHowever, everything changed, the moment we passed ten years of age.\u201d</p><br/><p>A light patter on the ground was heard from the tears coming from Li Xue. \u201cIt was I who changed, but from the start, you have not changed at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not bring up the past any longer.\u201d Ling Tian waved his hands a little impatiently. \u201cLi Xue, do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s heart was full of bitterness and she lowly agreed, before finally answering Ling Tian\u2019s question. \u201cActually, whatever I\u2019ve told you today was the truth. Ever since I was born, I never went out before! This is the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd why not?\u201d Ling Tian paused in shock, \u201cWith your current abilities, you would be satisfied burying yourself in the midst of a desolate mountain?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue only smiled lightly in response as she spoke with a bit of melancholy, \u201cEver since I followed you and mysteriously transported myself out of the yellow springs, I had this feeling that you were in the same world as me. I was not lonely at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you could actually endure and not come and look for me?\u201d Ling Tian exclaimed in shock, and also with some anger. \u201cI don\u2019t recall you being so patient before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook for you? While I wanted to do so, I didn\u2019t dare! If I met up with you, then what was I supposed to say to you?\u201d Letting out a distressed smile, Li Xue avoided his gaze as she continued, \u201cWhat\u2019s more, how was I supposed to look for you? I\u2019m just a small girl, I\u2019m only sixteen now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the reason why you hid yourself in the deep mountains, right?\u201d Ling Tian snorted, \u201cIt was because of me, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s eyes sharpened as he stared at her. In the night, it looked like two sharp swords directed to her face.</p><br/><p>Li Xue smiled but refused to reply. A cool breeze flitted past her hair, and a comfortable silence descended.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian continued to stare at her for a while before turning away and letting out a breath. Staring at the distance, he slowly spoke, \u201cYou might have owed me in the past, but, the debt has been long paid, or should I say that I already collected it a long time ago. You shouldn\u2019t do this, at least not like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue laughed as she softly spoke, \u201cYou too know that this world is more backward as compared to our old world, and our current knowledge could be considered frightening by the people in this current age. You were born in a wealthy family and can thus be considered as having backing, but if I were to appear in front of the masses, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat still isn\u2019t your true reason, you\u2019re most afraid that you\u2026 will snatch my limelight? You decided to lock yourself in the desolate mountains, prepared to rot together with those trees and grasses?\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s breath became more hurried, \u201cBut then, why would you appear now?\u2026\u201d Ling Tian realized something as he was speaking. However, he still continued to stare at Li Xue.</p><br/><p>He was full of remorse, full of gratitude, and full of\u2026 concern!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had suddenly understood why Li Xue would show herself at this point; the biggest reason was mainly that he was being pursued by the Martial Head! And she could tell that Ling Tian wasn\u2019t his match at all!</p><br/><p>Hiding myself in this age is because of you, exposing myself is also because of you!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian fell silent, and sat down without a word, lowering his head to look at the ground. It was unknown as to what he was thinking, but his mind was working furiously, much like a raging river flowing ceaselessly!</p><br/><p>In the past, he had always thought that she owed him that, and also affirmed that same thought. Even when he had taken his revenge, on the journey of the yellow springs, he had also thought the same thing. It was only until today that he recognized that he had actually racked up a debt instead, and it was unknown how much he owed. As for her, whatever she had owed had been washed clean together with the blast in the past life!</p><br/><p>At this point, there was an unknown feeling in Ling Tian\u2019s heart, the different flavors of sweetness, sourness, and bitterness flooded in, and he felt a sour feeling on his nose\u2026</p><br/><p>Before long, Li Xue\u2019 voice suddenly rang out, \u201cHow about you? Have you been doing fine these few years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a mocking laugh as he replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s not good about my life? Being a young noble, the third generation successor, and being clothed and fed finely, with all my wishes granted. I even have the name of the number one silkpants, so how can I not have a good life?! Naturally, it\u2019s better than yours as a lass in the mountains.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue chuckled and quietened down. It was only after a long while did she continue, \u201cSince you have such a good life, then why\u2026 why do you still wish to fight for hegemony?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian lightly sighed as he spoke with a heavy loneliness, \u201cThen tell me, other than this, what else can I do? What should I do in order to prove that I, Ling Tian, have been to this world before? Or should I put it in another way, that what else is enough to attract my attention? What can I do to relieve my boredom? You might know of my existence in this world, but in my world, there\u2019s only me and myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue pitifully gazed at Ling Tian, and said tenderly, \u201cI know, I know. These years haven\u2019t been easy on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian only grinned, but he thought to himself, How could it be easy, when I already had to start scheming and planning even when in my mother\u2019s womb? Everybody only saw only unbridled and rampant, but no one knew of the pains I had to go through! And who could understand how much I\u2019ve sacrificed in the darkness? I only had a childhood in my previous life, but in this life, I didn\u2019t even have a childhood\u2026</p><br/><p>From the moment the Ling Family met with an internal crisis, to the problem with the Yang Family and even to the Imperial Court, then finally to the Water of Heavenly Wind\u2026 he finally walked to this point, where he could contest with the various experts in the entire continent!</p><br/><p>Everyone seemed to see him as someone with far foresight, free and unrestrained, even unfettered and outside of the law! However, the reality was different. Which step of his wasn\u2019t cautiously and meticulously planned, as though treading on ice? How many times, as he walked the past few years, had he been face to face with death, then turned the tables? One wrong move and there would be no return! Who could see through the untold hardships which he had suffered? And right now he was even being pursued by the Martial Order Medallion owner, wandering around in a miserable situation!</p><br/><p>As he thought, Ling Tian only let out a sigh, coldly saying, \u201cJust take all of this as a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue smiled, but she seemed to have detected Ling Tian\u2019s inner turmoil, as she softly spoke, \u201cThis dream can be said to have been a really long one.\u201d As she spoke, she sat down beside Ling Tian, her large eyes blinking rapidly, as though she was scared, or not courageous enough. She seemed to hold on to some hope, as she slowly nestled up beside Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>The two bodies came into contact, and with a tremble, immediately separated. On Ling Tian\u2019s forehead, some cold sweat could be seen coming out. Li Xue carefully adjusted her body\u2019s angle, lightly trembling as she shifted her head towards Ling Tian\u2019s shoulders. Her eyes were slightly red and within her eyes, light sparkles could be seen forming like jewels\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

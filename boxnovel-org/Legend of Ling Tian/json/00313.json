Furthermore, we are the only ones who will never reach a compromise with them! Thus, Ling Tian will definitely choose to work with us for his revenge! Big brother, while this plan is a good one, it seems a little devious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The purple-robed man then snorted, \u201cDevious? What did we do?! In fact, we didn\u2019t even send out a single person to influence this matter. We have only watched silently by the side. Everything has been planned and executed by the Water of Heavenly Wind. In what way are we devious?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other person then said carefully, \u201cWe had long had news about this and could have stopped this matter, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop?\u201d The purple-robed man turned around and said with a chilly look, \u201cWhy should we stop it? Second brother, this is the war for hegemony and not skirmishes in the pugilistic world. There is no need to talk about virtue and morals! Your thinking is far too old-fashioned! This is also the reason why I can\u2019t be assured to hand over a larger authority to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only will we not stop this matter, we should even encourage it!\u201d He said with a sneer with killing intent filling his eyes, \u201cLing Xiao must die today! If Northern Wei and the Shui Family cannot stop him, I will kill him personally if it is necessary! As long as Ling Xiao dies today, the Water of Heavenly Wind and Ling Tian will definitely be enemies! Are you unaware that Ling Xiao\u2019s death would be tied to the future of the continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d The other person exclaimed, \u201cBig brother, this isn\u2019t the best right? We have just silently admitted Yan\u2019er and Ling Tian\u2019s wedding. Ling Xiao\u2026 he is, after all, Yan\u2019er\u2019s future father-in-law. We are relatives! Big brother, even if Ling Xiao doesn\u2019t die, both our families would still be extremely close to each other. But if we were to kill Ling Tian\u2019s father here, how will Yan\u2019er feel? This\u2026 isn\u2019t this a little immoral?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people who were speaking were the two giants of the Yu Family, Yu ManLou and Yu ManTang.</p><br/><p>Hearing what Yu ManTang had said, Yu ManLou flew into an outrage, \u201cB*st*rd! What morality? Ling Xiao is naturally Yan\u2019er\u2019s father-in-law! But won\u2019t that be true even after his death? As long as Ling Xiao dies here today, we will be able to ensure that Ling Tian will never join hands with the Shui Family! If not, how would a single Yan\u2019er be able to control Ling Tian? After observing Ling Tian for so long, do you really think that a single lady will be able to change his mind? If we aren\u2019t careful, the thousand year foundation of our Yu Family will be the one getting destroyed! Do you dare to make such a gamble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang lowered his head without saying a single word. While he still disagreed in his heart, he no longer voiced out his objection. He was extremely clear that once his big brother decided something, it was impossible for others to change his mind.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou then sighed and said in a gentle tone, \u201cSecond brother, you have an honest and sincere personality. While your kindness is a good thing among family members, you have to understand that our enemies, be they Water of Heavenly Wind, Northern Wei or Ling Tian, will never talk about pugilistic rules with us. In this world, one has to be unscrupulous in order to ensure his survival! At this moment, what is the reason for the Shui Family to infiltrate Heavenly Star? Isn\u2019t it all to wipe out our Yu Family? Since they aren\u2019t righteous, why do we have to talk about morality with them? Now that they have offended someone who they shouldn\u2019t offend, they are only shooting themselves in the foot! Presently, this is the best chance for our Yu Family to rule the continent! If we don\u2019t grasp this opportunity, I will never be able to forgive myself! When we die, we wouldn\u2019t be able to face our ancestors in the afterlife!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang then said with a look of worry, \u201cBig brother, the ancestors had instructed us to never fight for hegemony or we will definitely be destroyed! Is big brother going to ignore those teachings completely?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou gave a mocking smile, \u201cSecond brother, who was the one who set the ancestor\u2019s teachings? Isn\u2019t he just the family head from a thousand years ago? At that time, the Yu Family indeed didn\u2019t have the might to rule the world! But now, things are different! With chaos breaking out at any moment, no one will be able to fully insulate themselves from the chaos! Our Yu Family is just going with the flow, and we don\u2019t have any other choice. How are we ignoring the ancestor\u2019s teachings? Besides, as the family head, don\u2019t I have the right to change the teachings slightly? It is no more than a rule that a family head had set. Don\u2019t I have the right to change it as the present family head?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang then said solemnly, \u201cBig brother, you should remember the heaven-shaking character that appeared in our Yu Family three hundred years ago, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yu ManTang mentioned that, even Yu ManLou had a look of respect on his face, \u201cI naturally know, he was ancestor Yu FengYun. He was invincible in the continent and the number one character in our Yu Family from the ancient times!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang let out a bitter laugh, \u201cWhen ancestor Yu FengYun was about to pass on, there was someone who had asked him about the ancestor\u2019s teaching, hoping that he would leave behind a few words. At that time, ancestor Yu FengYun was already 133 years old and in a sickly condition. Upon hearing the words \u2018ancestor\u2019s teachings\u2019, his eyes lit up and use his last breath to say a few words: One can fight with men but not with the heavens! Big brother, have you forgotten about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou laughed in response, \u201cSecond brother, since when did I want to fight with the heavens? With the present situation of the continent, our Yu Family is only following the will of the heavens. How are we going against the heavens? If the will of the heavens really cannot be defied, I definitely would continue to lay in wait. But now, the opportunity to unite the continent is right in front of us! This is the opportunity given by the heavens! We would be going against the heavens if we don\u2019t grasp it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang then sighed, \u201cBig brother, let\u2019s not talk about this anymore. I will not be able to win against you in an argument and will listen to big brother\u2019s instructions. This little brother doesn\u2019t have any other opinions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou let out a satisfied smile and patted him on the shoulders, \u201cThat is my good second brother! This is the man of our Yu Family! This brother will only be able to hand you more responsibilities if you can be an unscrupulous individual!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, Yu ManLou looked at the battlefield and smiled, \u201cAs long as Ling Xiao dies, Ling Tian will definitely take his revenge. This old man here will then announce to the world Ling Tian\u2019s and BingYan\u2019s engagement! Then, we will aid Ling Tian to take over Sky Bearing as a dowry and destroy all the Shui Family members in our Heavenly Star Continent as a favor! Then, we will aid him in wiping out the other two nations, destroying both Northern Wei and Western Han to take revenge for his father. At that time, the situation in Heavenly Star would probably be more or less settled. With both Ling Tian and our Yu Family working together, I am certain that we can wipe out all others easily! This old man will then make a personal visit to the southeast to propose a marriage to the Xiao Family on behalf of Ling Tian. We can let them restore their marriage arrangement and make that Xiao lass Ling Tian\u2019s consort or even empress. We will definitely be able to grasp the Xiao Family\u2019s fortune in our hands! I believe that the Xiao Family will have no choice but to agree to the matter with our Yu Family\u2019s strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, we can take a break for three years to make preparations. After that, we can proceed to the Heavenly Wind continent to uproot the Shui Family! At that time, we would be invincible in the three continents and could be considered the ruler of the world! As for Ling Tian, I aided his revenge and helped him with the power of my Yu Family. I am sure he wouldn\u2019t fight with me over being the ruler of the world! Even if he has the heart to compete with me, the foundations of the Shui Family would definitely wipe out Ling Tian\u2019s accumulation of power over the many years! At that time\u2026\u201d Yu ManLou then began laughing with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>For the first time in his life, Yu ManTang saw his brother reveal his true ambitions! However, in Yu ManLou\u2019s laughter, Yu ManTang felt a chill which froze the depths of his soul\u2026</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s plan could be said to be perfect! Everything would follow on smoothly if Ling Xiao died here today! As long as Ling Xiao died here today, everything would definitely follow according to Yu ManLou\u2019s plans from now on!</p><br/><p>Now, the most critical part of his plan was about to come to fruition! Ling Xiao had less than 50,000 injured troops and was surrounded by over 400,000 enemy soldiers. There wasn\u2019t a chance for his escape! It seems as though it was the heaven\u2019s plan!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s body was covered in blood as he fought valiantly in battle! Ling Nineteen and the other three didn\u2019t dare to leave his side at all with more and more people falling around them. There were the Sky Bearing soldiers, Northern Wei soldiers, and even more Western Han soldiers!</p><br/><p>From the south, the sounds of galloping horses became nearer and nearer with a squadron of troops meeting the Northern Wei forces in battle! These troops were all filled with valiant soldiers each with magnificent combat prowess. However, they were few in number and only a little over 500. Facing the 400,000 enemy forces, they were no more than a drop of water in the river! After charging less than a thousand feet into the Northern Wei army, they were trapped in an encirclement by their enemies and couldn\u2019t advance or retreat!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao\u2019s soldiers were becoming fewer by the second with only Ling Nineteen\u2019s group, a bunch of Blood Iron Warriors and less than 10,000 ordinary soldiers left! They were already in a desperate scenario! The Sky Bearing army\u2019s formation was completely destroyed by the joint efforts of Western Han and Northern Wei and they were engaged in a bitter battle.</p><br/><p>The destruction of Ling Xiao\u2019s army was imminent! The battle was nearing its end!</p><br/><p>A look of excitement could finally be seen on Shui QianHuan\u2019s usually calm appearance! However, he didn\u2019t know that there was someone else even more excited than him in a tree nearby!</p><br/><p>As Shui QianHuan saw the four valiant experts by Ling Xiao\u2019s side cutting down enemy troops as though they didn\u2019t know fatigue was while they charged towards the south, he frowned and ordered, \u201cThe time is near and it is time for you guys to take action.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

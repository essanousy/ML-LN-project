After finally being able to come out and relax, he was actually unlucky enough to meet with an assassin! Just when he was about to catch the assassin, the assassin had actually slipped out of his hands! In this hunting trip of his, he wasn\u2019t even able to catch a single hare but left behind more than a hundred corpses instead! This made the Eastern Zhao crown prince frustrated to the point he almost went crazy.</p><br/><p>After a series of careful searching, DongFang XingChen returned to the capital with a lingering fear. Every time he heard the sound of crows cawing on his way back, he would be startled and placed on high alert. After finally arriving at the entrance to the city and witnessing the majestic city in front of him, DongFang XingChen could finally ease up slightly.</p><br/><p>He sat on the horse thinking about how he should find an excuse to take good care of DongFang JingLei and ensure that DongFang JingLei would be sent to the eternal damnations of hell\u2026 As he began brainstorming about the many evil schemes to achieve his goal, a horse galloped past him swiftly and DongFang XingChen felt as though a bolt of lightning struck him. There was actually a country-toppling beauty that was seated on the horse.</p><br/><p>Beautiful! She was just far too beautiful! How could such a stunning beauty possibly exist on the planet?! Is this the reward heavens are bestowing onto me after my dangerous trip out of the city?</p><br/><p>As the crown prince of an empire, DongFang XingChen had naturally seen many beauties before. However, there wasn\u2019t a single beauty that could be compared to this beauty in front of him! That chilly charisma of hers and perfect appearance made it so anyone who saw her couldn\u2019t help but dote on her. On top of that, her voluptuous figure was so monstrous but yet so humble. The most important point was the fact that this lady had appeared in front of him at this very moment! To the crown prince DongFang XingChen, this was a sign of fate! This was a sign that it was a gift from the heavens!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, all of the pent-up grievances, lingering fear, and dissatisfaction towards his subordinates had disappeared completely! The only thing that was left behind was lust and a burning desire to possess the lady in front of him!</p><br/><p>With a lecherous and greedy look in his eyes, DongFang XingChen studied Xiao YanXue\u2019s flawless appearance and was already raring to go. If he could subdue this woman under his body and have a wild night with her, he would have no more regrets in life!</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, meeting each other is a sign of fate. I wonder why you are in such a hurry and where you are headed to?\u201d DongFang XingChen tried to pick Xiao YanXue up. At the same time, his eyes narrowed to slits as his gaze lingered around Xiao YanXue\u2019s curvaceous figure. A ball of flame immediately burned in his navel and rushed downwards towards his little brother.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram! A good dog will not block the way!\u201d Xiao YanXue\u2019s nostrils flared up in anger as she waved the whip in her hand. If it was anyone else blocking her way, Miss Xiao would definitely not be so incensed. However, the man in front of her right now was the individual who had almost ruined her lifetime happiness! Seeing his lecherous appearance, Xiao YanXue was immediately disgusted and felt like vomiting on the spot.</p><br/><p>To think that her family would actually agree to marry her off to such trash! Thinking about that, Xiao YanXue was even more enraged.</p><br/><p>DongFang XingChen naturally did not know that the beauty in front of him right now was actually her nominal fiance, Miss Xiao of the Xiao Family. Thus, he looked at Xiao YanXue\u2019s angry appearance with interest and ignored the rudeness of the other party, \u201cAh ha ha, Miss is wrong. For us to have such a coincidental encounter in the vast lands, isn\u2019t it a chance granted to us by the heavens? Since we are fated to meet each other, why is there a need for you to spout such nasty words? While this prince is untalented, I am willing to accompany Miss to admire the beauty of the moon and feel the cool night breeze.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how the other party looked at him with disdain, DongFang XingChen decided to address himself as \u2018this prince\u2019. In other words, he was trying to flaunt his status as the crown prince and force the lady in front of him to submit.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had arrived long ago and stopped his horse by the side to watch the show before him with a smile that didn\u2019t seem like a smile.</p><br/><p>Even Ling Tian did not imagine that after being scared out of his wits and losing more than a hundred of his guards, this crown prince in front of him still dared to act so unbridled today! If not for Ling Tian being merciful and sparing his life back then, he would have reported to King Yama by now! To think that he still dared to flirt with Xiao YanXue in front of Ling Tian\u2019s eyes! He was truly a talent!</p><br/><p>The ignorant are fearless indeed!</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue snorted and ignored DongFang XingChen. Turning around, she realized that Ling Tian was laughing by the side and being a complete bystander without any intention of helping her. She could not help but be irritated in her heart and a plan surfaced in her mind. She then called out to Ling Tian, \u201cMy husband, save me! There are a few despicable lechers blocking my horse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately choked and almost fell off his horse. Xiao YanXue\u2019s words were truly potent.</p><br/><p>Indeed, more than a dozen pair of hateful eyes immediately turned to his direction after they heard Xiao YanXue\u2019s shout. Ling Tian could not help but be frustrated as he thought, Dammit, I only managed to let them stay alive after suppressing myself with great difficulty. Who would have thought that they would provoke me today! Could it be that these idiots are dying to go to the Yellow Springs?</p><br/><p>\u201cHusband?\u201d DongFang XingChen\u2019s expression turned nasty. To think that this peerless beauty before his very eyes already had a husband! How could such an elegant and exquisite peony be stuck into a pile of dung? This was unforgivable! DongFang XingChen felt a ball of anger rising as he glared at Ling Tian hatefully, \u201cYou are this Miss\u2019s husband?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at Xiao YanXue with a smile and replied in a casual manner, \u201cThat\u2019s right, she is my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAudacious!\u201d The guards by the side began shouting, \u201cThe person before you is the Eastern Zhao crown prince! Why aren\u2019t you kneeling down and paying your respects to him?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown prince?! You are the Eastern Zhao crown prince?!\u201d Ling Tian seemed to have suffered a great deal of shock as he looked at Xiao YanXue with a pale appearance, \u201cMy wife, this is the Eastern Zhao crown prince! I think the crown prince has set his sights on you and your husband is helpless. Why don\u2019t you follow him obediently? I know that you have a fiery temper but you must be understanding. If the crown prince gets angry, both of our families will definitely be in trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone present could not help but look at Ling Tian with disdain. So what if he is the crown prince of an empire? How can a man not protect his own wife but offer her up to another guy instead? Can he still be considered to be a man?!</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue who was familiar with Ling Tian\u2019s strength was even more dumbfounded. Looking at Ling Tian with her mouth wide open, she could not imagine that Ling Tian would actually say such a thing. While Xiao YanXue knew that Ling Tian was only making a fool of DongFang XingChen, she could not help but feel discomfort in her heart! She glared at Ling Tian hatefully and began weeping pitifully, \u201cMy husband, this woman will be your slave when I am alive and your ghost when I am dead. I will follow you and not leave you even in death. I do not want to follow any crown prince\u2026 wu wu wu\u2026 I do not want to follow the crown prince\u2026\u201d She then covered her face with her hands and began weeping miserably. At the same time, a crafty look could be seen in her eyes. Since you want to put up and act, this young miss here will play along with you! Let\u2019s see how long you can put up this act for! Let\u2019s see who will be the one to give in first!</p><br/><p>Not simple! She did indeed live up to the title of being the southern fortune deity. It would definitely be an easy task for her to win a small gold figure in his previous world. Ling Tian secretly gave Xiao YanXue a thumbs up as he cried out with grief, \u201cMy wife, just like the saying, \u2018a thin arm cannot win against the thighs\u2019. As a penniless broke person like myself, how can I win against the crown prince? Aiyaya, I am also helpless. My dear wife, I can only let you suffer some grievances first and I will definitely come back and redeem you when I am accomplished in future.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Xiao YanXue heard what Ling Tian said, she almost burst out laughing. What kind of a logic is this? Redeeming her in future after giving her away? However, she began to wail as she grabbed onto Ling Tian\u2019s arm, \u201cI don\u2019t want to leave you, husband\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>One person was bawling her eyes out while the other was repeatedly sighing and the atmosphere in the place became extremely miserable as the heartbreaking scene of two lovers separating unfolded before the eyes of everyone present. The guards by the side could not help but look at the young couple in front of them with pity in their eyes. At the same time, they also felt that their crown prince was also taking things too far. How could he destroy a family just because of a lady\u2019s beauty?</p><br/><p>This was an act that went against the heavens!</p><br/><p>As DongFang XingChen heard what Ling Tian had said, at first he nodded his head with a smile. Mmm, this brat is pretty wise. But as the conversation went on, he felt as though something was wrong. This brat is obviously trying to imply that I am a tyrant who wants to bully him and snatch his wife! After hearing Ling Tian\u2019s words, DongFang XingChen felt as though he was no different from the local hoodlums in the streets!</p><br/><p>Dammit!</p><br/><p>DongFang XingChen let out a heavy grunt and upon seeing that there weren\u2019t any other passersby, an evil thought rose in his mind. If you guys didn\u2019t cry or create a scene, I would have let the matter rest easily. But now\u2026 since there isn\u2019t anyone nearby and everyone here are my men, even if I wanted to snatch your wife, what can you do about it? As long I cover my tracks well and these guards do not say a thing, who would know of my actions after I kill you and bury you in the wilderness?</p><br/><p>He then looked at Xiao YanXue again, especially how her current pitiful appearance made him want to dote on her. The lower half of his body grew excited as the evil thoughts in his body could no longer be controlled. The corner of his lips also curled up into a lascivious smile.</p><br/><p>Even if I have to snatch, I will definitely snatch this beauty into my hands! Such a beauty is rare for even this Eastern Zhao crown prince! If I were to let her go today, wouldn\u2019t it be the biggest regret of my life?</p><br/><p>As though he noticed the thoughts of DongFang XingChen, DongFang Hen took a step forward and reminded, \u201cCrown prince, we aren\u2019t far away from the danger zone and we shouldn\u2019t remain here for long.\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang XingChen snorted and did not even bother looking at DongFang Hen. Currently, DongFang XingChen\u2019s displeasure towards DongFang Hen was like the unending river and vast ocean. The assassin was already heavily surrounded by all of their guards but this DongFang Hen just had to put up a show of elegance which resulted in the assassin escaping!</p><br/><p>What was the point of having such a foolish guard captain? Fighting with someone else was about putting your life on the line and not about acting cool or bothering about your elegance! Why would this crown prince want to witness the elegance of an old man like you? Don\u2019t I know how to visit the brothels for that? Even a simple action of those ladies shaking their behind would probably be more appealing than an old man like you!</p><br/><p>Looking at DongFang XingChen\u2019s eyes being filled with a malicious intent coupled with the intense desire of possession, Ling Tian could not help but be frustrated. Brat, it seems like I have no choice but to kill you today. Why do you want to seek your death?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The outline of his face was extremely distinct as though it was carved out by a sword and the feeling being emanated from him was as though he was an extremely sharp treasure sword! The killing intent that was being emanated was also one which could only be felt from a treasured sword!</p><br/><p>His gaze swept past the surviving members of the Shui Family and they immediately felt the cool autumn turn into the freezing winter. There was even a chill rising up from the depths of their hearts!</p><br/><p>This was Ling Jian! Sword of Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>The First Elder ignored the fatigue on his body and hurriedly stood up with an apologetic smile, \u201cSo it is little brother Ling who is here to receive us. For us to trouble little brother Ling to make a personal appearance, this old man is truly grateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, the First Elder was thoroughly enraged in his heart! The Ling Family said that they would provide support for them but had only arrived at the very end of the battle! If they had an expert like Ling Jian participating in the battle, not a single person of the Yu Family would have been able to escape and the losses of their Shui Family wouldn\u2019t have been so huge! Especially the fact that Ling Jian\u2019s martial arts definitely weren\u2019t weaker than the three black-masked men. With him on the battlefield, the situation definitely wouldn\u2019t be that horrible!</p><br/><p>But when he was truly facing Ling Jian, he did not even dare to voice a word of complaint. In fact, he did not even dare to show a tinge of dissatisfaction. He knew that this white-robed teen in front of him could turn all of his tired soldiers into a mountain of corpses by himself! In the face of such strength, even if he had a mountain of grievance in his heart, he could only bury it because of his incompetence!</p><br/><p>He naturally didn\u2019t know that Ling Jian had already participated in the battle and was even the one who killed the most! Furthermore, the black-robed man who caused Yu ZhanKong to pee in his pants was also this white-robed young man in front of them. It was just that the First Elder of the Shui Family couldn\u2019t recognize him. If Yu ZhanKong was here, he would probably be able to recognize Ling Jian based on his aura. After all, the black-masked man had imprinted too deep of an impression on Yu ZhanKong\u2019s heart!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s cold gaze landed onto the First Elder\u2019s face and he said emotionlessly, \u201cWe are not here to receive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The First Elder was stunned for a moment and immediately felt as though he had eaten a fly. He forced a smile and said, \u201cThen\u2026 little brother Ling is here for\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian replied coldly, \u201cI am here under Miss Ling Chen\u2019s orders to retrieve all of our Ling Family\u2019s riches which were stolen by the Yu Family from Sky Bearing! What has the rest got to do with me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ling Family\u2019s riches?\u201d The First Elder was smoldering with anger!</p><br/><p>His Shui Family had sacrificed more than a thousand people before finally being able to chase the Yu Family away who left all of these treasures behind. All of the treasures that littered the battlefield were supposed to be the victor\u2019s spoil of war. In other words, these treasures all over the floor should belong to their Shui Family! In fact, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that every item was stained with the blood of their Shui Family members!</p><br/><p>However, the Ling Family did not even send a single member from start to end and their Shui Family was the one fighting the whole battle. The spoils of war were also seized by their Shui Family but the Ling Family actually had the cheek to righteously claim ownership of the spoils of war! Furthermore, they were still shameless enough to say that these were originally the riches of their Ling Family!</p><br/><p>Not only did the Ling Family not put out any effort, they even wanted to swallow all the treasures alone! What did the Ling Family think their Shui Family was?! The First Elder was angered by Ling Jian to the point he almost spit out a mouthful of blood. He suddenly felt breathless and his face turned ashen as he almost fainted!</p><br/><p>After panting heavily for a moment, the First Elder managed to calm himself down and replied with a calm tone, \u201cLittle brother Ling must be joking.\u201d The First Elder tried his best to control his anger and prevented any trace of dissatisfaction from showing on his face but it was impossible for the First Elder to squeeze out a smile. Despite all of his efforts, a trace of anger could still be heard in his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cJoke?\u201d Ling Jian\u2019s lightning-like gaze was fixed onto the First Elder, \u201cAll of these originally belonged to my Ling Family and it was those Yu Family b*st*rds who stole it from our Ling Family\u2019s businesses without our knowledge! We only found out about this matter after performing our checks and I am here for this matter. Old Madam Ling has ordered that not a single copper coin can be missing! You actually dare to say that I am joking? Are my words very funny?? Could it be that all of these treasures are not from the businesses of the Ling Family?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The First Elder was intimidated by Ling Jian\u2019s sharp gaze and could not help but take a few steps back. At the same time, his tone also became weaker, \u201cLittle brother Ling, these treasures were captured by our Shui Family after all!\u201d At the same time, he cursed the Ling Family repeatedly in his heart, <em>You guys still have the cheek to say that not a single copper coin can be missing?! Shameless to the extreme!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder must be the one who is joking!\u201d Ling Jian snorted, \u201cYour Shui Family has a thousand-year-old feud with the Yu Family. Wasn\u2019t the purpose of your ambush to kill your enemies? Were you here to rob the Yu Family of their riches? Or could it be that you wouldn\u2019t have taken action if the Yu Family wasn\u2019t carrying this batch of treasure from the Ling Family? First Elder isn\u2019t very good at cracking jokes! Furthermore, even if your Shui Family didn\u2019t take action, I would have personally retrieved our Ling Family\u2019s treasures. It can only be said that under a series of coincidences, our Ling Family owes you a favor! We are extremely grateful!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Despicable! Shameless! This is the epitome of shamelessness! Since you guys want to snatch your treasures back, why didn\u2019t you take action earlier? Why did you only appear after the battle ended? Since these were the treasures of your Ling Family, why did you allow the Yu Family to leave with it? Could it be that you guys were truly clueless about it beforehand? Do you guys really treat us as fools?!</em></p><br/><p><em>Besides that, even if these are your Ling Family\u2019s treasures, it is already our Shui Family\u2019s spoils of war. It is fine if you want to take it away, but if your Ling Family wants to eat the meat, you have to let us drink the soup at least, right? You guys are now dissatisfied with eating the meat together with the bones and skin and even want to swallow the pot down your throat!</em></p><br/><p>It was no different from making use of their Shui Family as a spear!</p><br/><p>The First Elder was fuming to the point his body trembled. He never imagined that there could be such a shameless person in the world! In just a few sentences, he had made all of the sacrifices and efforts of their Shui Family worthless! All of their sacrifices were made in exchange for a worthless favor!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother Ling, wouldn\u2019t that mean that the thousand disciples of my Shui Family died for nothing?\u201d The First Elder was no longer able to control his anger and his tone became unfriendly.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian had originally turned around already and upon hearing those words, turned back and glared at the First Elder coldly. \u201cHow could it be that they died for nothing? First Elder\u2019s words aren\u2019t right. Didn\u2019t you guys also kill almost a thousand Yu Family members? The valor and bravery of your Shui Family\u2019s disciples were not for nothing! Your enemies were almost wiped out this time. What more do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian glared at the First Elder coldly and said with a frosty tone, \u201cCould it be that on top of dealing with your thousand-year-old feud, your Shui Family is eyeing the wealth of your alliance partner? That is an extremely despicable action!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d The First Elder was angered by Ling Jian\u2019s shamelessness to the point his limbs turned cold. After trembling for a short moment, his face turned red before turning pale white. He then spat out a mouthful of blood, staining his snow-white beard, before shutting his eyes and falling backward. He was actually angered to the point he fainted!</p><br/><p>Since he couldn\u2019t win against Ling Jian in a verbal or fist fight, perhaps fainting was the best option for him.</p><br/><p>The remaining Shui Family members glared at Ling Jian in an unfriendly manner as though they wanted to swallow this white-robed teen in front of them alive!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian frowned and said, \u201cYour Elder has suffered such heavy injuries, why aren\u2019t you guys taking good care of him? Now that he has fainted, quickly support him and treat him well. An old man like him requires good medical attention! Why are all of you guys still standing there like wooden poles?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Shui Family members were all dumbfounded! <em>Isn\u2019t this Ling Family brat too shameless? What does he mean by us not taking good care of him? Weren\u2019t you the one who angered him to the point that he fainted?</em></p><br/><p>A couple of Shui Family members grunted and placed their hands on their swords, taking a step forward with a baleful aura! If not for Ling Jian\u2019s exceptional strength, they would have probably charged forward to kill him by now!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face was immediately covered by a layer of frost. He suddenly lifted his head up and glared at the Shui Family members coldly, \u201cYou guys still want to fight me?!\u201d As he said those words, a heaven-encompassing killing intent exploded forth from his body and engulfed the Shui Family members like a tsunami. Ling Jian stood motionlessly on the spot and seemed to have turned into a heaven-shaking treasure with his bloodthirsty killing intent completely revealed!</p><br/><p>The few Shui Family members who had intentions of fighting Ling Jian immediately felt as though they had been thrown into a freezer. Under the pressing gaze of their opponent, they could not even take a single step forward and had to circulate all of their inner qi to withstand the pressing aura of their opponent. They did not dare to even move a single finger as their faces turned completely pale with beads of sweat rolling down their face and dripping onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian glared at them coldly and expressionlessly for a long while before letting out a sneer and turning around with disdain. He then shouted at the Ling Family\u2019s warriors who were collecting the treasures on the ground, \u201cHurry up, lest some fellows become greedy and are unable to control themselves. Not everyone has seen so much treasure in their lives and even a thousand-year-old family will act like little thieves in the face of such treasures!\u201d</p><br/><p>The warriors immediately acknowledged Ling Jian\u2019s orders and sped up the collection of treasures.</p><br/><p>After Ling Jian turned around, the Shui Family members immediately felt that pressing aura around them disappearing. They suddenly felt a wave of weightlessness and many of them stumbled from this sudden change. Looking at the spotless back of the white-robed teen, all of the Shui Family members felt a wave of helplessness and a deep sense of humiliation.</p><br/><p>As one of the two thousand-year-old families surviving in the world, since when had they suffered from such humiliation? The treasure that was supposed to be theirs was snatched by others in front of them. On top of that, the hundred or so of them did not even dare to let out a grunt when facing the pressure of a single person!</p></div>\n</div>"}

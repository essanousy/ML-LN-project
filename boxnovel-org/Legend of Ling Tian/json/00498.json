Looking at the look of despair on her face, Li Xue mocked with ridicule, \u201cMiss NanGong, I really have to thank all of you. Your idiocy and unreasonable jealousy caused you and your subordinates to become a whetstone for us to groom an outstanding leader for our Ling Family Courtyard. Do you see that? When all of your dog lives disappear, the effect that I want will be fully displayed. While all of you are pathetically weak, the effect of your lives is truly enormous. This is something that you should definitely be proud of.\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu breathed heavily as she glared at Li Xue with despair. She then growled with hatred, \u201cUsing my life as a whetstone? You must be dreaming!\u201d</p><br/><p>Peng! Li Xue\u2019s foot shot towards NanGong Yu\u2019s chin and the sound of bones breaking could be heard. NanGong Yu\u2019s chin was shattered by Li Xue\u2019s kick and she was unable to commit suicide by biting her tongue. Following that, Li Xue kicked NanGong Yu\u2019s inner core and her chilly inner qi flooded into NanGong Yu\u2019s inner core causing it to explode. Li Xue then said chilly, \u201cYou will definitely walk down the Yellow Springs but there isn\u2019t a need for you to rush. I will keep you alive until Ling Chen kills you. If she doesn\u2019t want to kill you, even if you cannot hope to be alive, you definitely cannot die! How can I not make good use of the last big present that your NanGong Family gave me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring NanGong Yu\u2019s look of despair, Li Xue crossed over her body and spat out coldly, \u201cTake them away!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Chen, who was off to the side, opened her eyes, and a complicated look could be seen in her gaze. She looked at the dismembered body parts in front of her which was her doing and the hellish scene in front of her. Her lips and body began trembling, but Ling Chen resolutely chose to keep her eyes open and refused to look away.</p><br/><p>Li Xue was right. In fact, she was also extremely clear about that truth. Would she want to bring disaster to her most beloved man just because of her soft-heartedness? In this chaotic world, one will either kill or be killed. If Ling Chen didn\u2019t want any harm to fall upon her brothers and beloved man, she could only harden her heart and face the world!</p><br/><p>Young noble and Ling Jian had already shouldered too much for me over the many years. They had already been drenched in blood far too many times. Could it be that I, Ling Chen, will have to hide behind their backs forever? Can I not stand in front of them for once?</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s face turned paler and paler but her eyes grew more and more resolute. The trembling of her body gradually stopped and she held the sword in her right hand tighter and tighter\u2026</p><br/><p>Li Xue let out a heave of relief. It seemed like Ling Chen had already thought things through and taken her first step out. Everything else was only a matter of time. After the next ten days, a brand-new Ling Chen would definitely be before their eyes! This was something that Li Xue was extremely confident of!</p><br/><p>The actions of Ling Lei and the others were undoubtedly swift. In just a short few minutes, not to mention the battle scars, not even a drop of blood could be seen. If someone were to pass by here right now, they would definitely not expect that a battle had just taken place\u2026</p><br/><p>In the next ten days, the whole Courtyard suddenly turned silent. In those ten days, a huge and clear change occurred in this silence. It was a change that could not be stopped!</p><br/><p>The first day, Li Xue stood outside Ling Chen\u2019s door early in the morning and chased her into the stone chamber where the NanGong Family members were being held captive as though she was a criminal. The ten people in the stone chamber were the ten people that Ling Chen had to take care of for the day. After Ling Chen entered the cave, Li Xue mercilessly closed the thick door of the cave.</p><br/><p>After a full six hours, Ling Chen finally walked out of the cave with a pale expression and trembling body. Her whole body was drenched in sweat and the moment she walked out of the cave, she began vomiting incessantly to the point her gastric juices were vomited out. Following Ling Chen\u2019s exit, a few people entered the room swiftly and ten bloody corpses were carried out.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was clad in black robes as he looked at the stone chamber expressionlessly and silently. However, his fists were clenched tightly to the point his veins protruded and turned green. While he felt heartache for Ling Chen, he knew that this was something that Ling Chen had to go through. This vicious and vile Li Xue! She deserves to be taught a lesson! To think that she would actually treat lass Chen as such. She actually had the heart to do something that both the young noble and I can\u2019t bear to do! At this moment, Ling Jian truly did not know whether he should thank or hate Li Xue!</p><br/><p>He was filled with contradiction\u2026</p><br/><p>Today, Ling Chen did not eat a single thing, and she felt dizzy for the whole day. She woke up from her dreams multiple times and began puking before falling back asleep. She would then wake up again, start puking again before falling asleep again. Such a cycle continued for the whole day.</p><br/><p>The second day, when Li Xue arrived at Ling Chen\u2019s doorstep, the extremely frail Ling Chen who was emotionally and mentally drained opened the door and walked out of her room on her own. She held her sword in her hands and after both the ladies looked at each other for a moment, Li Xue led the way to the stone chamber. As Ling Chen walked into the stone chamber unsteadily, there were another ten people in the cave; ten people who were about to enter the Yellow Springs\u2026</p><br/><p>Two hours later, Ling Chen exited the stone chamber and despite wanting to puke, she managed to control herself from doing so. She immediately rushed back into the room and collapsed onto her bed!</p><br/><p>The third day, Ling Chen, who had slept for a full day, finally drank two bowls of porridge. When she left her room, Li Xue stood in her courtyard coldly and had a stare down with Ling Jian who was at a distance.</p><br/><p>The fifth day, Li Xue was no longer waiting in front of Ling Chen\u2019s door but at the entrance of the stone chamber. Seeing Ling Chen\u2019s arrival, her eyes lit up and she asked, \u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d These words of hers were said with a profound tone. Be it Li Xue who was asking the question, Ling Chen who was about to answer the question, or Ling Jian and the rest who were by the side, they all understood the true meaning of these words.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s face was chilly as her muscles contorted slightly. However, her eyes were filled with resolution and she replied calmly, \u201cI have to come eventually.\u201d In her tone, a faint tinge of grievance and resentment could be heard.</p><br/><p>The mission today was completed with great difficulty. Ling Chen only managed to walk out of the stone chamber when the sun set and her clothes were completely drenched with blood. On top of that, a slightly crazed look could be seen in her eyes, but she no longer had the feeling of vomiting. When she looked at Li Xue after exiting the room, a pleading look could be seen in her eyes.</p><br/><p>However, Li Xue shook her head coldly and said, \u201cWe will continue tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>She then left\u2026</p><br/><p>Behind her, two clear streams could be seen on her face\u2026</p><br/><p>Today, after the soldiers finished tidying up the stone chamber, they could not help but end up vomiting as well. There were ten bodies that died in ten different ways. They could not help but think to themselves, Could it be that Miss Chen used the bodies of these individuals to draw flowers with her sword?</p><br/><p>On the eighth day, when Ling Chen left the stone chamber, Li Xue had actually commanded people to serve up two bowls of steaming beef noodles. The noodles were garnished on top with red colored condiments. She then called Ling Chen over to enjoy the noodles with her and happily ate one of the bowls. This action made Ling Chen, who already had a certain degree of immunity and didn\u2019t really feel disgusted anymore, puke for a whole afternoon. Of course, this incident made Ling Jian greatly displeased and he almost wanted to find Li Xue for a fight!</p><br/><p>Even if she wanted to train someone, she should have some limits! A vicious lady is vicious indeed\u2026</p><br/><p>At night, Li Xue ignored the disagreement of everyone else and forcefully brought Ling Chen out of the Courtyard. She purposefully picked the place where the almost hundred members of the NanGong Family were buried and the two of them chatted for a whole night\u2026</p><br/><p>On the ninth day, Ling Chen who had not have proper breakfast for eight days actually ate a bowl of rice and soup. She then entered the stone chamber without any hesitation. This time, Ling Chen only used ten minutes. She didn\u2019t puke or sleep and actually went to settle the daily affairs that she had ignored over the past few days\u2026</p><br/><p>On the final day, Li Xue did not make an appearance at all and Ling Chen only spent five minutes in the stone chamber. When she left, her face was calm and a complicated look could be seen in her eyes. Her dress was spotless, and she was like a fairy who had just returned from a stargazing trip. When she entered her room, she used a snow-white handkerchief to wipe the body of her spotless sword.</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu\u2019s body was carried out of the chamber and this vicious lady finally came to the end of her life. However, in her final journey on Earth, she had fully taken on the role of being a pig to be slaughtered. How would she be feeling in her heart?</p><br/><p>After NanGong Yu\u2019s death, Ling Chen stood in front of her grave for a moment before leaving emotionlessly. The final wish of NanGong Yu resounded in her heart: When Ling Tian returns, I hope that you can bring him here and ask him to spend some time here. However, please do not tell him who is buried under the earth. Up until her death, NanGong Yu still had a trace of pride and her unrequited love\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Chen let out a mournful sigh\u2026 a pitiful person definitely has something hateful\u2026 Perhaps this phrase should be reversed; a hateful person definitely has something pitiful. Regardless, everything is already over, and it is time for you to rest in peace. Have a good journey, NanGong Yu! Perhaps there will be a second life?</p><br/><p>No matter what, Ling Chen would never let NanGong Yu off. With NanGong Yu\u2019s temperament, actions, and craziness, perhaps the only form of release for her was the lonely road of death!</p><br/><p>As such, the Ling Family Courtyard reverted back to normal. Ling Chen, Li Xue and the rest also went back to normal. On the surface, the conversation between the few ladies wasn\u2019t any different but there seemed to be something different about Ling Chen. There seemed to be something extra and something lacking at the same time. But after a short while, everyone quickly got used to it\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

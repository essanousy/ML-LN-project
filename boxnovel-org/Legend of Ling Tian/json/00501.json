However, regardless of how he swore or cursed in his heart, he would never dare to take care of Xiao YanXue. Especially using such a method to take care of her\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian never believed that he was a good man. But with regards to women, he had a great deal of resistance. Especially a lady who was swaying between him and her own family. Ling Tian had his own principles, and he would never touch Xiao YanXue under such circumstances. It would be even more impossible for him to possess Xiao YanXue now only to abandon her in the future. If he were to have a relationship with Xiao YanXue, he would definitely take responsibility for her until the very end. At the same time, if Ling Tian was unable to take responsibility for her, he would never take another step in their relationship, lest the other party or himself end up in a dilemma.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could mercilessly kill his foes on the battlefield regardless of gender, but he was extremely careful when dealing with matters of the heart. This was probably a form of insistence as well.</p><br/><p>Tonight, young noble Ling Tian could no longer hold himself back any further and sealed Xiao YanXue\u2019s acupoints before throwing her into the tent. He then left the tent and sat cross-legged in meditation near the tent. This was because Ling Tian felt as though there was some oddity in his inner qi and it was fluctuating strangely. Ling Tian knew that this was the sign that his inner qi was about to achieve a breakthrough and if Xiao YanXue was in his embrace, he would probably seriously injure her the instant he achieved a breakthrough! For safety considerations and because he was afraid of being annoyed by that lass, Ling Tian decided to just seal up her acupoints.</p><br/><p>After three rounds of circulation of his inner qi, a loud bang went off in Ling Tian\u2019s head, and the inner qi all over his body began churning uncontrollably. His inner qi flowed through his body rapidly like a rushing river and with the force of a thousand-foot waterfall! At the same time, pure inner qi rushed into his body from the BaiHui acupoint on his head and YongQuan acupoint on his feet!</p><br/><p>In just an instant, Ling Tian immediately felt that he was in danger! The inner qi in his body that was rapidly absorbing the pure qi from his surroundings was completely out of his control! It had turned extremely violent, and his usually gentle inner qi seemed to have turned into a completely unreasonable beast full of destructive force! As for the target to be destroyed, it was naturally Ling Tian! The violent inner qi smashed against Ling Tian\u2019s meridians with each wave being more powerful than the previous one!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately felt as though he was like a small boat in the ocean and was in danger of capsizing at any moment. He couldn\u2019t help but be in shock! While there were dangers in the previous breakthroughs of his cultivation, this was the first time Ling Tian was completely helpless and without any confidence!</p><br/><p>This was definitely not the sign of his cultivation breaking through! A breakthrough in cultivation would definitely not be accompanied by such a situation! Just what went wrong? Ling Tian was completely puzzled. However, he did not have the chance to ponder over the matter at the moment as all of his thoughts and attention were exhausted in combating his violent inner qi. In fact, Ling Tian did not even notice that there was a small glow on his chest like a firefly in the summer\u2026 every time it flashed, the inner qi in his body would become more violent\u2026 at the same time, the ball of light seemed to be flashing with a certain rhythm\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shut both his eyes and tried to protect his last shred of consciousness as he silently endured the violent attacks of his inner qi. The pain in his body was overwhelming and it far exceeded the pain he felt when he consumed the Great Cyclic Pellet. It was as though all the meridians in his body had been shattered before being connected up again and it was as though all of his bones were shattered into small fragments before being joined up again. Such pain was something far beyond what an ordinary human would be able to bear!</p><br/><p>From the beginning to the end, Ling Tian did not even let out a grunt! Not only did he not let out a grunt, his countenance remained calm and not a single change on his expression could be seen! While his body was completely drenched in cold sweat and every single inch of his muscles was trembling and cramping up uncontrollably, Ling Tian still held onto his final shred of consciousness without letting go. He forced the muscles on his face to be completely within his control!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Tian had the feeling that death was right before his very eyes. He could feel death slowly approaching him and while he did not know why he could feel death extremely clearly! Thus, Ling Tian forced out a smile on his lips. Since he couldn\u2019t avoid it, he would endure to the very end! Since he couldn\u2019t avoid it, then he should face death calmly and with a smile!</p><br/><p>His inner qi flowed even more rapidly in his body! It was as though there was a hundred-foot dragon being trapped in a small space less than a square meter, struggling to get out with all of its might but unable to find an opening to burst free\u2026</p><br/><p>With two \u2018pa pa\u2019 sounds, Ling Tian\u2019s left and right shoulders were destroyed by his violent inner qi and his blood shot out tens of feet! His inner qi immediately rushed out of his body rapidly and with a \u2018hong\u2019 sound, his clothes were shattered and his well-built figure was completely revealed. On his well-built figure, trails of blood could be seen emerging on his body!</p><br/><p>The meridians in Ling Tian\u2019s body had been expanded to their maximum capacity at this moment! It was also all Ling Tian could endure at the moment! In Ling Tian\u2019s inner sight, he could see his inner qi gushing through his meridians as though they were liquefied. Furthermore, the amount of inner qi was increasing every moment!</p><br/><p>If a person had such wide meridians, any inner qi formula he cultivated would definitely achieve twice the result with half the effort. Even his attacking speed would definitely be increased by many times! However, Ling Tian\u2019s present situation was a fine example of \u2018too far is as bad as not enough\u2019! His meridians were expanded to the very limits of what a human body could take, and if his inner qi violently rushed at his meridians again, Ling Tian\u2019s inner qi would definitely be completely shattered. The blood flowing throughout his body and even his innards might rush out from his body. At that time, even a descending celestial would not be able to save Ling Tian\u2019s life!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could clearly detect all of these, but the inner qi in his body was no longer within his control and there was a mysterious force at the top of his head and bottom of his feet rapidly taking in qi from his surroundings. It continued to crazily gather within his body while crazily roaring in his body. On the surface of Ling Tian\u2019s body, a rapid airstream could be seen visibly gathering around his body with a whooshing sound! It was just like the sound of crying ghosts!</p><br/><p>His skin began to inflate again!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s life was on the line!</p><br/><p>Death was so near to him!</p><br/><p>A black figure landed in front of Ling Tian soundlessly and the moonlight revealed Justice\u2019s clear facial features! This number one expert who had disappeared after the fight with the 18 Above Heavens experts and who was the biggest danger to Ling Tian, had actually appeared at this very moment! He had found Ling Tian\u2019s whereabouts and arrived by Ling Tian\u2019s side!</p><br/><p>On his shoulders, a slanted ancient sword could be seen. If Ling Tian opened his eyes at this moment, he would definitely be able to tell that this was the very sword that the powers of the continent fought over, the Heaven Splitter! It seems like after this number one expert was ambushed by the Above Heavens experts, he decided to carry this divine weapon with him.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Tian\u2019s appearance, Justice could not help but be astounded and a look of incredulity could be seen on his face. From the ancient times until now, Ling Tian\u2019s situation had never appeared before. Even if one suffered from cultivation deviation, Ling Tian\u2019s present situation would never happen!</p><br/><p>Justice was astounded! He suddenly stretched out his hand and rapidly shot out towards Ling Tian\u2019s BaiHui acupoint. Not a trace of killing intent was present in his action and he purely wanted to give Ling Tian aid. Even if he wanted to kill Ling Tian, he would fight Ling Tian openly and would disdain taking advantage of such a situation!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Justice did not have the thought to kill Ling Tian at the moment! He had rushed over the moment he detected Ling Tian\u2019s aura with killing intent but now, he did not have a single thought of killing Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>How can I let my opponent die like that?</p><br/><p>I have been lonely for far too long. Without an opponent worthy of being a match for me, life is just too boring!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian must not die! Even if he must die, he must die in my hands!</p><br/><p>Justice rapidly placed his palm over Ling Tian\u2019s head and facing the pressure from an external source, Ling Tian\u2019s inner qi rushed out rapidly. Justice took in a deep breath and forced his arm down. With a bang, Justice was completely astonished, and his arm was actually forcefully pushed back. Ling Tian\u2019s inner qi and had actually forced this number one expert back by a step! Justice\u2019s face even flushed red!</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Justice let out a shocked cry and looked at Ling Tian with incredulity. As a peerless expert, he naturally knew what this inner qi meant. Such a powerful inner qi was not something that a human body could endure and not something that a person would be able to cultivate! Such inner qi was enough to stuff any martial arts expert to the point he explodes! Even Justice would not be an exception!</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Justice also understood how much pain Ling Tian must be enduring right now. But seeing Ling Tian\u2019s calm expression, Justice could not help but be filled with admiration for this young opponent of his!</p><br/><p>Such mental strength was something that even he did not have! If Ling Tian was to have another few more years, he would definitely be able to grow up to become a martial arts grandmaster! However, it was a pity\u2026</p><br/><p>Justice let out a long sigh! With his experience, he could naturally tell that Ling Tian was beyond saving. If even his inner qi that was almost unparalleled in the world was unable to suppress the inner qi in Ling Tian\u2019s body, there was probably nothing in the world capable of suppressing it\u2026</p><br/><p>Was Ling Tian dead for sure?!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Tian suddenly opened his eyes and a pair of profound eyes looked towards Justice. His eyes were filled with calmness, and it even carried with it a trace of joy. Justice could clearly see that Ling Tian was calmly giving him a farewell at this moment\u2026 Justice could not help but feel his heart shake! The fear of death was completely absent from this youngster\u2019s face! He had actually seen past life and death! At the brink of life and death, he did not struggle needlessly but decided to face it openly! In fact, he even decided to embrace it!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

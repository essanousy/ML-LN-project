XiMen BuHui\u2019s sword was embedded deep in Kong YuanYang\u2019s chest, and in the exact same spot on his body was where Kong YuanYang\u2019s sword was stabbed into! They had already stopped breathing, but their eyes were still wide open, with their sword hand tightly gripping onto their respective sword hilt. Even in death, their bodies were supporting each other, ensuring that they retained their original posture so that they wouldn\u2019t fall!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sighed once loudly, bowing deeply to the two of them, \u201cBoth of you are indeed real heroes! Ling Tian is filled with respect! May you rest in peace.\u201d Straightening himself, he turned as he continued, \u201cMay we still fight again as enemies in our next lives!\u201d</p><br/><p>To be so calm in the face of difficulties, and smile at the thought of life and death, treating everything indifferently, how many of such people were there in the world? Ling Jian and group also couldn\u2019t help but have a hint of respect in their eyes, all bowing towards the two corpses.</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian departed, he calmly ordered, \u201cWhile they\u2019re our enemies, they\u2019re also worthy of our respect! Command the Violent Wind to give the two men a proper burial, at the fastest speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>After everyone left, a faint shadow vanished from a tree big enough for three people to hug that was on the roadside beside where the fight took place. There actually had been someone witnessing the whole scenario that Ling Tian and Ling Chen couldn\u2019t discover, even with their enhanced senses! What level of skill was needed to achieve that?</p><br/><p>Right now, it was already past midnight, and the Smoky Thea Tower was in a state of silence. Only the occasional sound of Third Master Yu\u2019s snores, sometimes long and short, much like a piece of melody being played, sounded out.</p><br/><p>In the Extreme Joy Chamber, the XiMen Family\u2019s second in command, XiMen BuRuo who had led the troops over, sat there with a neutral expression. In front of him, the cup of tea had long lost any of the warmth it had, obviously, he didn\u2019t even have a bit of interest in drinking the tea.</p><br/><p>On the other side, XiMen Qing was anxiously pacing around the room, and he couldn\u2019t help but keep mumbling, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they back yet? Such a long time has passed, even if they had settled it outside the capital, they should be already back, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the side, Six timidly sat at a corner, his eyes darting together with the pacing of XiMen Qing\u2019s body. He then tried to placate XiMen Qing by saying, \u201cThey should be on the way back? Master BuHui has always been dependable in getting things done, so there shouldn\u2019t be a problem. What young noble should do now would be to consider how you\u2019re going to play with those two \u2018toys\u2019 of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>XiMen Qing nodded his head, feeling more assured, and finally sat down. Tilting his head to look at Six, he smirked, \u201cI know you definitely have something in mind, brat. What do you have to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu\u2019Zi let out a crafty smile as he said, \u201cYoung noble has already said how this two ladies are not only talented in drawing and the zither but are both also peerless beauties. The two of them would definitely be chaste, and wouldn\u2019t easily give in, so if you threaten them with death it might not get the results you want\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>XiMen Qing immediately felt his spirits lifting up from this, \u201cWhat good ideas do you have, quickly tell me, this young master will reward you handsomely!\u201d</p><br/><p>Six let out another weird laugh as he lifted up a jade bottle. \u201cYoung noble, inside this bottle contains a medicine with the name \u2018Irremovable Lasciviousness\u2019. This was only obtained after a great effort on my part, and inside only contains thirty-two pills, truly a wondrous drug. When a man takes a pill, he would instantaneously have the strength and vitality of a dragon and tiger, witnessing a huge rise in his vital yang, and if a female were to ingest it, her lust will soar to the high heavens, to the point that even a chaste woman of nine generations would be screaming for release. Later, you can use some of these pills of the two women and watch their effects!</p><br/><p>XiMen Qing revealed a face of joy, \u201cThis is indeed a good thing. After I\u2019ve had my fill, you can take over from me and have the time of your life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Six was overjoyed, immediately bowing and saying, \u201cThank you, young master, for your kindness! Young master will definitely enjoy himself to the fullest today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, there came a low voice from the window outside, and a voice mockingly spoke out, \u201cYour house\u2019s young master will definitely enjoy to his heart\u2019s content today. He\u2019ll enjoy so much that he will not be able to enjoy himself anymore. That\u2019s what real enjoyment will be!\u201d</p><br/><p>XiMen BuRuo immediately stood up, shouting, \u201cWho?!\u201d He could hear that the speaker had profound martial cultivation, but this voice didn\u2019t sound like any of his family members!</p><br/><p>The cloth curtain was lifted as a person leisurely walked in. Dressed in simple robes with a belt tied, his robes were white as snow, and the smile on his face sincere. This was precisely the target of the XiMen house, Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the XiMen family wanted to look for me for revenge, and this young noble couldn\u2019t bear to disappoint you guys, but those troops you sent really couldn\u2019t even move me. Thus, I had no choice but to send myself to your doorstep.\u201d Ling Tian spoke with a smile on his face, before grabbing onto a chair and seating down, crossing his legs.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, there was such a matter?\u201d XiMen BuRuo couldn\u2019t help but let out an expression of surprise. \u201cYoung noble Ling must be mistaken, for someone of your caliber, could it be that any Tom, Dick, and Harry could provoke you? Young noble Ling really can jest.\u201d Being the second in command at the XiMen Family, how could XiMen BuRuo not have a certain level of intelligence? The moment he saw Ling Tian walk in, he knew that their operation had completely failed today and that Ling Tian had probably employed large numbers of experts outside to deal with them. At this critical juncture, how could he admit anything? His only hope now was that Ling Tian would fear the interference of other families, and not choose to do anything! So long as they survived past this, there would be more chances in the future!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I must have been mistaken.\u201d Ling Tian seemed to be in deep thought, slowly nodding his head. He suddenly turned towards XiMen Qing, his gaze sharpening, \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure why young noble XiMen here spoke of capturing my two close confidantes, is that another mistake? Could it be that young noble XiMen had spoken wrongly, or that I had heard wrongly?!\u201d</p><br/><p>XiMen Qing\u2019s handsome face paled in that instant, unable to muster back his original spirited look. His voice trembled as he replied, \u201cNone\u2026 none of your business, you\u2026 you had better not\u2026 malign others\u2026 kakaka\u2026\u201d Under his extreme fright, he couldn\u2019t control his trembling, and his teeth knocked against each other, cutting him a sorry sight.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian coldly laughed in reply, no longer bothering about him, and started to think aloud, \u201cYoung noble XiMen has such a graceful and refined bearing, so how could Ling Tian not allow you to enjoy to your heart\u2019s content today? This would be greatly disrespectful to you, who had come here from such a far location!\u201d As he finished, his face turned frosty as he ordered, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you guys bringing in the toys for Young Noble Qing to have his fun with!\u201d</p><br/><p>A sound of assent rang out, and six black-robed men each carried a red-robed body, walking inside with great difficulty. In a few moments, the six bodies were thrown in a heap on the floor. Their acupoints had been pierced, which caused them to be completely immobile and unable to talk. All of them were from the Death Troops, and upon seeing XiMen Qing and XiMen BuRuo, all of their faces changed for the worse.</p><br/><p>XiMen BuRuo was naturally able to retain his calm, but XiMen Qing\u2019s face immediately became a deathly white. The lackey Six sat by the door, and upon seeing the situation turn ugly, he silently began to creep towards the door, wanting to flee.</p><br/><p>Clang! Ling Chi casually drew out his sword and laid it at the throat of Six. The ghastly energy emitting from the sword caused his Adam\u2019s apple to bob up and down nervously, his neck immediately having goosebumps such that it looked like a plucked chicken skin. He stood there like a statue, not even daring to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, didn\u2019t you bestow something good just now, ready to enjoy to your heart\u2019s content with your young master? Now you want to leave early?\u201d Ling Chi\u2019s voice was also frightening to hear!</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Master XiMen.\u201d Ling Tian took two steps forward. \u201cI must congratulate you on your good fortune, for tonight you\u2019ll witness a never before seen, a one and only good show! You\u2019ll realize that your trip to Sky Bearing this time has not been in vain.\u201d</p><br/><p>XiMen BuRuo remained calm, asking, \u201cMay I ask what show is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed out, a weird tone contained within as he waved his hands, \u201cLet Second Master have a look at the show! Relax, the actors, props and stage will all be provided for by your XiMen Family, guaranteed to be as natural as possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian and the other five immediately drew out their swords, thrusting them towards XiMen BuRuo! While the sword point pierced through his robes, touching his flesh, none of them even drew a bead of blood from it. This spoke volumes about their control!</p><br/><p>XiMen BuRuo definitely had some skills, but how could he stand up against five experts who had drawn their sword at once? He was immediately subdued, and could only sigh in defeat.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian moved like the wind, immediately pressing on his acupoints, XiMen BuRuo\u2019s body went limp on the chair, and other than his ears which still worked perfectly, the rest of his body was completely immobile!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian fished out the jade bottle from Six\u2019s hand, tossing it up in the air as he grinned, \u201cGreat noble XiMen, I\u2019ve long heard of your wish to be left behind in the historical records. This junior here was actually racking my brain trying to help you, but to think that you actually gave me such a great idea. Hehe, with this suggestion from your loyal subordinate, this junior can guarantee that you enter the historical annals, never to be forgotten!\u201d</p><br/><p>XiMen Qing\u2019s eyes widened like saucers as he began to retreat step by step. His voice quavered as though he had already realized what Ling Tian was planning, for this was what he had planned to do to Ling Chen and Yu BingYan! He seemed to be gasping for breath as he spoke, \u201cYou\u2026 what are you trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled benevolently as he replied, \u201cYoung noble XiMen has good eyesight, to take a fancy for my two close confidantes. I believe that the wives and concubines in your family are probably unable to satisfy you to your heart\u2019s content. This junior was worrying about that for you, but to think that this would be a case of \u2018unable to find the destination even after wearing out iron soles, but inadvertently finding it without any effort\u2019, that such a good thing could actually be so near to young noble. I believe that you\u2019ll not only enjoy tonight but will also leave your mark in history. This is killing two birds with one stone!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian lightly shook the bottle and continued, \u201cI heard that this thing is called \u2018Irremovable Lasciviousness\u2019, hehe, seems like you\u2019ll have the vitality of dragons and tigers after consuming it, and your vital yang will surge, unable to be quenched. This really lives up to its name, causing you to sink into lasciviousness, unable to break free! You tell me, what would happen if you\u2019re all fired-up, but there are no women near you? HAHAHA\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! You can\u2019t do this\u2026\u201d Under the extreme stress, XiMen Qing actually regained his vocal faculties. \u201cYoung noble Ling, Brother Ling, this is all my fault. This junior here had eyes but didn\u2019t recognize this noble one. I beg for your forgiveness, young noble Ling, please leave me an escape path, I, XiMen Qing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if you\u2019re XiMen Qing?\u201d Ling Tian viciously smiled. \u201cTo have designs on my women and even resorting to such underhanded methods, if I didn\u2019t let your reputation go down in history, making you infamous for life, how could I stand to see your vile guts?! Today would be the best time to repay you!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

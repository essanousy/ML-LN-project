Apart from the unbridled gaze in his eyes, there was a tinge of disappointment, grief, and unfamiliarity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re all dead? Three souls and seven bodies, a full ten XianTian experts are all dead? The four elders who went as reinforcements\u2026 not a single one of them came back alive?\u201d Yu ManLou glared at him fiercely, \u201cCan you tell me what is going on? Tell me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, you are asking me what is going on? I should be the one asking you that question!\u201d Yu ManTian panted heavily as he grunted, \u201cBig brother, Ling Tian had a five-year bet with you with the world as the wager. This bet is probably known by everyone in the world already! During the empire founding ceremony of our Yu Family, the Ling Family did not send anyone to create trouble and even gave us a huge gift. But why is it that you sent people to perform those despicable actions during the Divine Prefecture Empire\u2019s founding ceremony? Assassination and the bewildering grass? Big brother, I am a boorish person but I know what it means to repay kindness! However, how did you choose to repay kindness?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Yu Family has been the number one family in the entire world for the past thousand years. Why do we have to do something like this? Can it be that our thousand-year-old family does not have the magnanimity and bearing of a nouveau riche Ling Family? We will definitely be looked down upon by others!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPreposterous!\u201d Yu ManLou flew into a rage. Since when would his foolish third brother know how to reprimand him? \u201cShould you be saying such words? The victor is king and loser vilified! This has been true since ancient times! The history books will only be written by the victor. As long as we achieve victory in the end, who cares about the means we employed? On the contrary, if my Yu Family loses in this battle, do you think that there will still be a Yu Family in the future?! For the hegemony of the world and our future generations, what did I do wrong as the family head of the Yu Family? Don\u2019t forget that you are also a descendant of the Yu Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Family descendant? Future of our Yu Family?\u201d Yu ManTian let out a desolate laugh, \u201cBig brother, if the future of our Yu Family has to be passed down through such despicable means, then\u2026 we should just give up on our future generations!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cB*stard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPA!!\u201d Yu ManLou slapped Yu ManTian on the cheek and was angered to the point his body began trembling, \u201cYou you\u2026 you actually dare to speak such heretical words? Don\u2019t let me punish you with the family law! Don\u2019t think that I will tolerate you time and time again just because you are my brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily law?\u201d Yu ManTian burst out into laughter and could not be bothered about the burning sensation on his face. He then glared at Yu ManLou and roared, \u201cBig brother, you have changed! Since when did you change? Why have you changed so much?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen did I change? How did I change?\u201d Yu ManLou gave Yu ManTian another good beating.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, there are some things that I don\u2019t know but don\u2019t want to know either.\u201d Yu ManTian turned around and said with a lonely tone, \u201cBack then, the three of us grew up together and we both remember how big brother took care of both me and second brother. Back then, no matter the trouble on the outside, big brother would definitely protect us. The three of us brothers have always been as one and we would always talk through the night. The elders of our family had always said that they had never seen brothers with such good relationship before. In the past thousand years, only the three of us would not fight for authority without anyone of us leaving first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou let out a soft sigh and tenderness could be seen on his face. Looking at the wounds on his third brother\u2019s body, he could not help but feel his heart ache, \u201cThird brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since big brother took over the position of the family head, the Yu Family prospered day by day, firmly stabilizing its place as the number one family on the continent. Both second brother and I were full of joy and tried our best to aid big brother, afraid that we might be lacking in some ways, allowing others to look down on us brothers. While I, Third Master Yu, am a brute, I know that big brother does everything for our Yu Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know since when, but big brother has slowly changed. You have changed greatly. You have become too eager for success and will resort to any possible means in order to attain your goals! It isn\u2019t that second brother and I weren\u2019t aware, but we chose not to say anything and silently support big brother. However, the matter with BingYan chilled my heart completely!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian suddenly flew into a rage as he roared with a malevolent glare, \u201cBig brother! My heart is completely chilled! It is thoroughly chilled! BingYan is a direct descendant of our Yu Family! She is your biological niece! Your biological niece! How can you bear to treat her in such a manner and make use of her as such? You attempted to harm her life on more than one occasion! Before when BingYan was young, you hugged and kissed her! You also loved her greatly! How could you bear to do these things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother! I also have my difficulties! I am the family head of the Yu Family!\u201d Yu ManLou roared with anger on his face before sighing, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to say anything else!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! I want to continue! I will only say all of this once! Perhaps, this will be the last time I can talk to you like this!\u201d Yu ManTian\u2019s eyes were red as he glared, \u201cFor you to treat BingYan as such, have you ever thought about second brother and sister-in-law\u2019s feelings? BingYan was plagued with illness since she was young, and what has our Yu Family given her? What right do we have to make use of her as such?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would BingYan suffer from such an illness? Why? Second brother and sister-in-law both knew the reason but they just weren\u2019t willing to talk about it!\u201d Yu ManTian\u2019s chest rose and fell heavily. \u201cEighteen years ago when sister-in-law just conceived BingYan, big brother had also fallen ill! Have you forgotten? After the blood that you vomited out was buried, the place where it was buried still hasn\u2019t grown any form of grass even up to now!!!\u201d Yu ManTian suddenly roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, sister-in-law was well versed in medicine and she helped you to treat your injuries and purged the poison! She refined the medicine for you when she was still carrying BingYan! The smell in the herb room was sufficient to choke someone to death! It was full of poison! Big brother, don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know anything just because I am stupid!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSister-in-law had always been healthy before that but she fell ill after treating you. After giving birth to BingYan, she passed away! She died because of treating you! Why would BingYan be riddled with illness? WHY? Aren\u2019t you clear about that? If not for sister-in-law refining medicine for you, how would BingYan be plagued with the Divine Black Negative Meridians?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop talking!\u201d The arteries on Yu ManLou\u2019s face bulged and he roared loudly, \u2018Shut up! I am asking you to shut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The guards on the outside heard the commotion and came in to ask, \u201cYour majesty, do you have anything to assign us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram! All of you scram far away!\u201d Yu ManLou roared, \u201cAnyone who dares come within 300 feet shall be executed without mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The guards were startled and left as though they were escaping for their lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you allow me to say it? Why can\u2019t I talk about it if you are able to do it?\u201d Yu ManTian sneered, \u201cSister-in-law already died in order to save you and her daughter was plagued with a strange illness. However, this is how you choose to treat her only daughter?! Big brother! Are you still my big brother?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s face which was usually calm began contorting in pain, \u201cAlright\u2026 you can speak your mind! What else do you know?! You might as well say it all now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going to say it all anyway!\u201d Yu ManTian exploded, \u201cEven if you are the emperor now, I will still say whatever I want to! Hmph hmph, big brother, the sickness from eighteen years ago wasn\u2019t a sickness, right? What kind of sickness would be so sinister? What kind of sickness would be able to change the character of a XianTian realm expert?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian continued with anger and his voice turned chilly, \u201cBig brother, the graveyard to the north of Bright Jade City had been extremely strange over the past few years. There would always be strange corpses from time to time. Furthermore, big brother seems to visit the north very often right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou hurriedly turned around and glared at his third brother fiercely, \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will only ask you a single question. Did you cultivate the evil martial art that our ancestors forbade us from cultivating?\u201d Yu ManTian roared, \u201cYes or no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou fell silent and the atmosphere in the room suddenly became extremely chilly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ah ah\u2026\u201d Yu ManTian laughed desolately, \u201cYou do not need to answer me. I already know the answer. Ever since I was young, I was very stupid and naughty, so I do not know anything. But ever since Shui WuBo died a mysterious death under your hands, I figured it out. Even if Shui WuBo\u2019s cultivation wasn\u2019t a match for yours, the difference wasn\u2019t so big and it was impossible for you to kill him so easily! Furthermore, he had even made a breakthrough in the last moment but you managed to win and kill him without suffering any injuries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have finished what I wanted to say. Do as you wish, big brother, your majesty. Hahaha\u2026\u201d Yu ManTian began laughing maniacally.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s face was chilly to the point it was frightening. \u201cDoes anyone else know about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho else would know about this? Rest assured, there isn\u2019t anyone else.\u201d Yu ManTian chuckled, \u201cNo one else apart from me. I didn\u2019t say anything to anyone else. Is this a glorious matter? Should I be letting others know about this? Even if you are shameless, I still want my face, the Yu Family still has to have our face!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou shut his eyes and a violent glow could be seen in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian was completely unhindered. His eyes were red and his breathing heavy. However, these could not conceal the grief and disappointment in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou turned around and his originally scholarly face was completely dark. Looking at Yu ManTian, he waved his hand up into the sky. Yu ManTian shut his eyes with his arms crossed.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou struggled for a long while and could not bear to swing it down. He then let out a long sigh and ordered, \u201cMen! Invite Third Master into the heavenly prison and take good care of him! Without my orders, no one can visit him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The guards who came forward were startled and did not dare to make a move. They never imagined that the emperor would give such an order to imprison his own younger brother, King Martial Bravery, into the heavenly prison!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian snorted and turned around. \u201cHeavenly prison? That is a good place for me to retire.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

Even a single blink of an eye would be enough! DongFang JingTian didn\u2019t hope for much but only for a slight opening to escape!</p><br/><p>At the same time, the heavily injured DongFang JingTian forgot about all the prestige a martial arts expert and Family Head should have as he shouted, \u201cMen! Assassin!\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, he only had a single life and his pride was worthless in comparison!</p><br/><p>In just this short encounter, DongFang JingTian knew that the martial arts of this assassin were just far too high. Even if he were to fight this assassin in a head-on battle, it would be impossible for him to contend against this assassin! On top of that, the speed of this assassin was just too frightening!</p><br/><p>Ever since he was born, DongFang JingTian had never seen a person who possessed such speed. In fact, he couldn\u2019t even dream of a human achieving such speed. However, someone with such terrifying speed was before his very eyes at this moment!</p><br/><p>The most depressing fact was that this person who possessed such a terrifying speed was here to kill him!</p><br/><p>Between his life and pride, DongFang JingTian made the extremely wise decision to choose his life. To a person who had lived for more than half a century, staying alive was far too important.</p><br/><p>DongFang JingTian\u2019s judgment was extremely accurate!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s sword light chased after him like a formless shadow and before the guard who was treated like a punching bag could even feel fear, he had already plunged himself into Ling Tian\u2019s brilliant sword light.</p><br/><p>Pu pu pu\u2026 a series of extremely soft thuds sounded and the guard\u2019s burly body had already turned into a bloody mist. A bright ray of light then shone through the bloody mist and Ling Tian charged out wielding his sword like a demon who charged out from hell! His figure then appeared closely behind DongFang JingTian like a shadow and the slight delay was actually completely useless!</p><br/><p>Behind Ling Tian, another guard collapsed onto the ground with a look of incredulity and a bloody trace on his neck. While the bloody trace was almost undetectable, it was also the cause of the guard\u2019s death.</p><br/><p>The right hand of the guard was placed on his hilt as though he wanted to pull out his sword. However, when he collapsed onto the ground, his sword was only pulled out half a foot.</p><br/><p>Up until his very death, he could not understand how this black-robed assassin could slice his throat while charging forward in the opposite direction. He could not understand just how he died!</p><br/><p>At the same time, DongFang JingTian\u2019s scream had alerted the whole DongFang Family and the DongFang Family fell into chaos.</p><br/><p>The corner of Ling Tian\u2019s lips curled up in disdain and his figure drifted towards the pitifully escaping DongFang JingTian! Was a character like this fit to become the Family Head of a Great Family? What a joke!</p><br/><p>DongFang JingTian was scared out of his wits!</p><br/><p>At this moment, in order to escape from the black-robed man, DongFang JingTian had even used his blood essence to activate a forbidden technique. He wasn\u2019t hoping to kill the enemy but only the chance to escape with his life! He only hoped that his speed would increase to escape with his life!</p><br/><p>The most important thing was for him to escape with his life!</p><br/><p>But even with his speed increasing to twice his usual speed, he was still unable to escape from the attack of the black-robed man! The chilly aura of death could be felt at his back and it was undeniably a result of the assassin\u2019s sword being pointed at his back! He accelerated to the fastest possible speed and in just this short span of time, he had already begun to pant heavily with his heart thumping so rapidly as though it was about to jump out of his throat\u2026</p><br/><p>Despite him being as fast as lightning and displaying a speed far exceeding his prime, DongFang JingTian felt as though he was stepping on cotton and inching forward slowly with every step he took.</p><br/><p>He could already feel the warm breath of the assassin breathing down his neck and the moisture of the assassin\u2019s breath dampening his skin\u2026 DongFang JingTian was filled with hopelessness! Following that, DongFang JingTian\u2019s eyes almost bulged out and the tip of the assassin\u2019s sword appeared in his chest with a flash of light accompanying it. It glimmered in the moonlight and was completely spotless. Not a single drop of blood could be seen on the sword as it penetrated through his chest!</p><br/><p>A killing strike!</p><br/><p>A sure-kill attack!</p><br/><p>Following that, the glimmering sword tip disappeared and the assassin\u2019s figure disappeared completely. He disappeared into the night sky as though he had melded into the wind\u2026</p><br/><p>That sword strike had completely destroyed DongFang JingTian\u2019s lifeforce. Even if DongFang JingTian\u2019s heart was misaligned, it wouldn\u2019t make a difference. When Ling Tian stabbed the sword into DongFang JingTian\u2019s chest, he also sent his inner qi rummaging through DongFang JingTian\u2019s body. Not just his heart, even DongFang JingTian\u2019s innards were completely reduced to a pile of mush at that moment!</p><br/><p>Not a single person would be able to survive with such injuries!</p><br/><p>The moment Ling Tian retracted his sword, DongFang JingTian had already ceased breathing and did not have a single trace of life. He had turned into a complete corpse! However, the most bizarre thing was that DongFang JingTian\u2019s feet continued to move subconsciously and he was still escaping for his \u2018life\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>In fact, his body was even able to make a perfect dodging motion just based on muscle memory alone\u2026</p><br/><p>On DongFang JingTian\u2019s body, there were three wounds which spewed blood out endlessly and under DongFang JingTian\u2019s powerful inner qi, blood shot out in all direction like fireworks exploding in the sky\u2026</p><br/><p>Shua shua shua\u2026</p><br/><p>Dozens of black-robed figures hastily landed in the courtyard and witnessed the scene with their eyes wide open in shock. Seeing the two hollowed-out wounds in their Family Head\u2019s body, they just could not believe how their family head was still able to continue sprinting\u2026 Everyone felt their hair standing on all parts of their body and a chill running down their spine\u2026</p><br/><p>A fake corpse?!</p><br/><p>Despite all of them watching from the side, none of them could do a single thing! The culprit who assassinated their Family Head had already disappeared completely leaving behind only three corpses. One was lying on the ground, the second was reduced to a bloody pile of mush, and the last was still sprinting for his \u2018life\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>The inertia of DongFang JingTian\u2019s body was finally spent, and his corpse collapsed onto the ground! The dried leaves which had just fallen onto the ground were immediately swept flying into the sky before drifting back to the ground slowly.</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbfounded!</p><br/><p>All of these people were extremely clear about their Family Head\u2019s strength and it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that he was the number one expert in the family!</p><br/><p>However, that mysterious assassin obviously did not give the Family Head any chance to retaliate. Before all of them had arrived, their Family Head was already running desperately for his life!</p><br/><p>The assassination should not have taken a very long time. Their Family Head had just left from a meeting with them and such an incident had happened almost immediately. The bulk of them then rushed over the moment they heard their Family Head\u2019s plea for help and they definitely did not take any longer than four breaths of time! In just a short moment, a top-notch expert of the continent had lost his life! He did not even have the chance to let out a second cry for help!</p><br/><p>Just what kind of strength did the assassin have to make this possible?!</p><br/><p>From the position of the two fallen guards, the three of them should have been attacked the moment they entered the courtyard. From then on, their Family Head began escaping for his life and from the splattering of blood in the surroundings, it was obvious that their Family Head had used a forbidden technique to increase his strength. If not, it would be impossible for the blood to spray out so far. It was only possible if the body faced a certain amount of pressure!</p><br/><p>However, he had been killed in a single strike despite such speed!</p><br/><p>After this mysterious assassin completed such a heaven-defying task, none of them were able to even spot his shadow! What powerful martial arts! What unfathomable speed!</p><br/><p>It was too frightening and too stunning!</p><br/><p>The same figure could not help but float up in all of their minds. Could it be that the assassin was the Martial Order Medallion owner, Justice? In the world today, only the legendary Justice would have such abilities!</p><br/><p>But why would he assassinate their Family Head?!</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at the three corpses quietly in a daze not knowing what to feel in their heart. They felt fear, despair, anger, depression, and were even at a loss. However, fear of the event and happiness that they weren\u2019t the victims had undeniably made up the bulk of their emotions.</p><br/><p>After experiencing the unparalleled martial arts of this mysterious assassin, a single thought floated up in all off their heads: If I did not go separate ways with Family Head previously and followed him here\u2026 or if I had arrived a moment earlier, not only would I be unable to save the Family Head, I would have sacrificed my life as well\u2026</p><br/><p>All of them could not help but tremble unconsciously as they felt how close they came to meeting their deaths\u2026</p><br/><p>Like a gust of wind, Ling Tian traversed through half the city and appeared outside the window of an inn. He placed a single finger on the windowsill and his whole body hung in mid-air. His other hand then knocked onto the window gentle as he asked politely, \u201cIs someone at home? An uninvited guest is here to peek at a beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>After returning from an assassination mission, Ling Tian was actually able to speak in such a casual tone as though he was a refined scholar coming to meet a good friend of his.</p><br/><p>With a creaking sound, the window opened and Xiao YanXue\u2019s beautiful face appeared before Ling Tian. Her lips were pouting as she glared hatefully at Ling Tian without saying a word. Ling Tian only looked at her with a bright smile on his face but neither of them said a thing.</p><br/><p>A long while later, Xiao YanXue finally gave in. She took a step away from the window and said \u2018coldly\u2019, \u201cUninvited guest, please enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled and entered the window before cupping his fists, \u201cThank you, Miss.\u201d Following that, he then let out a long sigh, \u201cI never imagined that even a lecher would face such nice treatment. I am truly elated.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue could not contain her laughter and burst out laughing, \u201cThis rotten mouth of yours\u2026 it can really anger me to death with a single word but also tickle me until my sides ache\u2026 I am truly convinced!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my special ability, and I\u2019m not willing to teach it to anyone else.\u201d Ling Tian chuckled and lifted up a teacup, drinking the tea within it in a single gulp.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou you you\u2026\u201d Xiao YanXue\u2019s face turned completely red. That teacup was the one which she had just used and was holding in her hand a moment ago. On top of that, it still carried the lingering smell of her lips\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

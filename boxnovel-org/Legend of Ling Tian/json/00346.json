Recently, he had another blood feud with the XiMen Family as well! At the same time, he was trying to plot against the NanGong Family and keeping his guard up against the Xiao Family. Of the Eight Great Families of the Heavenly Star Continent, he had offended four families in one go, and this didn\u2019t include the number one financial magnate, the Xiao Family. Now, he had also offended the Shui Family! If it was anyone else who had so many enemies, he probably would have suffered a miserable death already, but Ling Tian was still able to lead a carefree life!</p><br/><p>Was he crazy? With so many enemies and the mere strength of his nouveau riche Ling Family, he was actually able to remain indifferent! He was actually able to gain the upper hand against his many enemies! Just how did he do that? Was this something a human could accomplish?!</p><br/><p>After letting out a sigh, Shui QianRou gathered her thoughts back. \u201cYoung noble Ling\u2019s thoughts are as deep as a ravine and this little girl shall not attempt to make a fool out of myself. Can I ask young noble Ling just when you intend to let us out? I hope young noble Ling can give me a clear date!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat would depend on yourself,\u201d Ling Tian chuckled. \u201cWhat are you going to do for me to let you out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s gaze lit up immediately. Ling Tian\u2019s words indicated that it wasn\u2019t impossible for her to be set free and that Ling Tian didn\u2019t have the intention of holding her captive for life. The only problem was whether or not she could offer Ling Tian something that he couldn\u2019t resist. Realizing this, Shui QianRou fell into deep contemplation. She didn\u2019t have the confidence that she would be able to offer Ling Tian something irresistible. After all, her present resources were far too limited\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, right, I need to remind Miss Shui about something,\u201d Ling Tian said with a smile. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to attempt to seduce me. Although all heroes will find it difficult to disregard a beauty, while this young noble is a hero, I am also a gentleman. I will definitely not succumb to the skirts of a lady. Furthermore, this young noble\u2019s standards are very high and there is no need to make a fool of yourself with ordinary makeup!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou immediately gnashed her teeth in anger! What a despicable individual! Bearing with her injuries that were yet to be healed, she dolled up herself meticulously for a full three days! For what? So that she could awe Ling Tian with her beauty when he saw her! No matter how beautiful the ladies around you are, I am sure that I am not the lesser of any of them! At the very least, you should feel some pity towards a lady, right? Shui QianRou was betting on that fact for her to give out her conditions and possibly form an alliance with Ling Tian. It would be best if both their families could reach a win-win outcome with everyone happy.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou had even considered what Ling Tian would say, what reaction he would have, and how she should respond to him. She had already made many possible conjectures but never expected Ling Tian to render her preparations completely useless with just a few words! Furthermore, Ling Tian had also shattered her confidence! Unbearable!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m really flirting with a blind man!\u201d Shui QianRou hatefully retorted, \u201cI\u2019ve chosen the wrong image to show this time!\u201d She was irritated over having wasted her time dolling up, and this immediately included that unromantic and crass man in front of her!</p><br/><p>\u201cErm\u2026\u201d Ling Tian scratched his head a little in embarrassment, before smiling and replying, \u201cActually\u2026 Miss Shui is mistaken. I, Ling Tian, can definitely see that you\u2019re flirting. It\u2019s just that\u2026 while you\u2019re definitely better than all the ladies in Smoky Thea Tower, your expression has somewhat of a hint of killing intent\u2026 This\u2026 this would probably scare away everyone that you look at. Let\u2019s not even mention having a charming and gentle look\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence angered Shui QianRou so much that her old injuries flared up, causing her to vomit out blood. Ling Tian, you\u2019re good, to actually compare my beauty with courtesans, how vicious can you be!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright.\u201d Shui QianRou knew deep in her heart that she was not Ling Tian\u2019s match when it came to shooting off her mouth, and could only lower her face in defeat. \u201cYoung noble Ling has such a sharp tongue. This lady here will admit her defeat. But what exactly do you want, please state all your conditions! What I can promise you, this lady here will not shirk from it, but if I really can\u2019t do as you say, then I can only accept my fate of being a guest here for eternity. Please don\u2019t play hard to get with me anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled at that, \u201cMiss, you\u2019re indeed decisive. Then Ling Tian here will be direct as well. I don\u2019t have any long-lasting hatred with you and the Shui family, and while I feel that whatever Miss Shui has done was overboard, in your eyes, the same applies to whatever I\u2019ve done. However, if we were to exchange roles, I believe that we would both be capable of worse things, don\u2019t you agree Miss Shui?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou thought for a moment before replying with a dazzling smile, \u201cThat\u2019s right, your words make sense. However, what I want to hear is your next sentence!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, then since already have this consensus, and that I have also kept Miss Shui trapped in here for so long, this will be a pickle for me to solve.\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s face looked quite uncomfortable. \u201cAfter all, even though you might be married off one day, but as of now, you\u2019re still the untainted princess of the Shui Family. If I were to release you, and you go back and leak even a sentence, then the entire Water of Heavenly Wind would know that I\u2019ve laid my hands on you. Regardless of my motive at that time or how well I treated you since, they would still seek me out for revenge, isn\u2019t that right Miss Shui?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Since the truth was as such, Shui QianRou saw no reason to hide it. If she tried to do so, then there wouldn\u2019t be any point.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second point is that even the Yu Family has been involved.\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s expression looked as though he wanted to cry. \u201cThat time, I was so concerned over your survival that I didn\u2019t notice and killed the two Yu Family elders! A dead man can\u2019t be brought back to life, so as long as Miss Shui goes out and proclaims it a little, I believe even the Yu Family would come seeking revenge. Both the Yu Family as well as the Shui Family are the same, they\u2019re all hegemons that I can\u2019t afford to provoke! And there\u2019s still Yan\u2019er who will be angry with me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense is this!\u201d Shui QianRou couldn\u2019t help but retort. \u201cThat time, the Yu Family were obviously running away, but you mercilessly went after them to ensure that they died! This has nothing to do with saving me, don\u2019t try to be hypocritical and blame it on trying to save me. There\u2019s always been the blood of both Yu and Shui Family on your hands, so don\u2019t try to twist the facts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed at her outburst. \u201cThis young lady here, your joke is a little too cold! My feelings for Yu BingYan are almost known throughout the world! If not for Miss Shui, then I would\u2019ve long ago invited the two elders back to my house to properly attend to them! After all, they\u2019re Yan\u2019er\u2019s clansmen. But because of you, I had to send them over to King Yama instead. While I didn\u2019t intend to kill them, it\u2019s true that they died for me. In the end, it was because of you, Miss Shui. You can\u2019t just shirk responsibility just like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Shui QianRou snorted coldly. Right now, Ling Tian\u2019s tone was a little out of sorts, making her feel uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe third point is that in the battle to protect my father, I killed many of your family\u2019s experts. Now this is a great blood feud.\u201d Ling Tian sighed out loud, \u201cI\u2019m actually a benevolent person by nature, even avoiding the ants when I sweep the floor. To have killed so rampantly, this really is a sin among sins.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou was stunned beyond words. This was bringing shamelessness to a whole new level! To say such words and not even be a little bashful! She really wanted to kneel down in respect.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe last matter is regarding Miss Shui staying here. While I can protect my secrets now, but once Miss Shui gets out, your mouth belongs to yourself, and thus I can\u2019t stop you from saying anything! Don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Ling Tian looked more and more depressed by the minute. \u201cDon\u2019t even mention about an oath or something, that\u2019s for silly people! I\u2019ll never buy it. Anyhow, how can you actually guarantee your silence? And furthermore, if I release you, what benefits do I gain? Hais, so many points to consider. While I aspire to be a hero, I\u2019m after all still an ordinary mortal. Since things have reached such a stage, I can only beg for forgiveness from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once this fourth statement had been spoken, Shui QianRou was shaken. Of course, she could guarantee her silence, but how could she prove it to Ling Tian? And that jerk even said it clearly that he wouldn\u2019t believe in oaths.</p><br/><p>How could someone like him exist? Shui QianRou wanted to hug her head and scream out. She was left without a choice!</p><br/><p>At this point, Die\u2019er who was originally silenced with a look from Ling Tian suddenly came forward, whispering something to Shui QianRou. This was followed by Shui QianRou\u2019s eyes lighting up, as well as a light blush appearing on her cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all direct people, and thus little sister also has no way to convince you. But I have a makeshift solution.\u201d From her bosom, she withdrew a piece of jade, saying, \u201cThis jade pendant is something that has never left my side, a pledge of love that my mother once gave to me. This is the heirloom of our Shui Family, the Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade. My mother mentioned this before, that whoever I give this to, will be my husband in the future! This concerns my lifelong happiness, so does young noble Ling think that this is good enough to serve as a promise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian accepted it and felt a cold wave travel through his hand. This was actually a rare Yin-type jade! He didn\u2019t even look at it, instead placing it in his pocket, laughing out, \u201cWhether I believe in it remains yet to be seen, but at least this can help me to avoid the current hot weather!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

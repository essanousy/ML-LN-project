If an artist doesn\u2019t plan in advance, how would they be able to display their flair on paper? Yan\u2019er, you\u2019re blessed with superior intelligence, how could you make such an amateurish mistake? The definition of a perfect artwork\u2026\u201d Ling Tian sighed once, \u201c\u2026 refers to your artistic skills, intent, spirit, style and core melded into one, now that\u2019s perfect art! You have the skills and the outline of the intent, but you\u2019ve only just been exposed to the artistic spirit, so at times your portrait is vibrant and at times lacking in spirit. The definition of spirit is essentially the character within an artwork. For a beautiful piece of work, just the concept is not enough, one has to inject it with character, then would it be the meat on the skeleton! As for style, it emphasizes on uniformity, one should always use the same style in drawing all things! A master painter can tell that the author of the artwork is an amateur if the artist\u2019s style is disordered and messy. Lastly, the core of the painting has to have some form of realism within, for example a drawn flower would be able to attract bees and butterflies, and if a youthful lady was drawn, it has to be able to ignite the hidden desires of a ma\u2026 cough cough. In any case, that\u2019s about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the last sentence, Ling Tian nearly choked himself to death on his words; what nonsense was he spouting? While it might have seemed normal in the twenty-first century, it was greatly inappropriate for this age. This was especially so for the last sentence!</p><br/><p>Indeed, the two ladies let out protests while having reddened faces, but surprisingly Yu BingYan didn\u2019t come forth with fists ready to pummel Ling Tian, instead remaining in deep thought and muttering, \u201cHow do I reach this state?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian secretly laughed to himself as he spoke, \u201cThat stage is the extremity of painting, with your current stage now, you could only be considered to have just stepped past the threshold of artistic spirit. To reach the pinnacle, hai! It\u2019s easier said than done!\u201d Looking at the downcast look on BingYan\u2019s face, Ling Tian softened his tone a little, \u201cHowever, there\u2019s still a way! As long as this master is here, haha, this isn\u2019t a big problem. Didn\u2019t you notice that Chen\u2019er has already improved by leaps and bounds? This is all because of my teachings!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian\u2019s preaching at the beginning were half-truths, he had done so because he wanted to pave a road for Yu BingYan to begin fusing the Dao of Art together with the Dao of the Martial Way. From Xue Leng, Ling Tian had learned that not only was Yu BingYan afflicted with an incurable disease, she was also the representative for the sixty year battle with the Shui Family, so he had come up with this plan. In truth, he didn\u2019t have much confidence, so in order not to cause too much disappointment to Yu BingYan, he could only use this roundabout method to spur her on!</p><br/><p>Based on her current condition, if Yu BingYan didn\u2019t take a novel approach and forge a new path on her own, then she would definitely lose and die in the battle three years from now! This was something Ling Tian couldn\u2019t accept! Furthermore, because this matter involved the honor of both aristocratic families, and they didn\u2019t accept substitutes, Ling Tian couldn\u2019t come up with any better idea except this.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan suddenly jolted up and hugged Ling Tian\u2019s arm, pouting while shaking it, \u201cNo wonder why Sister Chen\u2019s paintings always look so good, it turns out that she is already near the peak! Brother Tian, you have to quickly teach me, I want to reach this stage too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian put on a stern face as he replied, \u201cYan\u2019er, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to teach you, but rather that this path is thorny and difficult to walk\u2026 Chen\u2019er spent ten years before she could achieve her current accomplishments, and I don\u2019t want you to go through the same thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan gently bit her lower lip as she resolutely replied, \u201cI\u2019ll definitely succeed! If I don\u2019t, then I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d She couldn\u2019t finish her sentence even after a long time, her little face dyed completely crimson.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you fail, then you will have to be young noble\u2019s woman; if you succeed, then you get young noble as your husband!\u201d Ling Chen burst into laughter as she jested.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister Ling Chen, you\u2019re bullying me!\u201d Yu BingYan couldn\u2019t restrain her embarrassment, throwing herself towards Ling Chen. Only after tussling for a while did they stop, sweating profusely. With the hairpins skewed and eyes dazed with exhaustion, the two were a beautiful sight to behold.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly explain your idea. I want to hear how difficult it is!\u201d Yu BingYan urged at this point.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian hid his smile as he glanced at her. He decided to throw another leash towards her, such that he could completely be in control of her, saying, \u201cWhat happens if you end up crying and throwing a tantrum and asking to quit when it gets too difficult? I think you better not, or else even Chen\u2019er would laugh at you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan flared up and stubbornly said, \u201cBrother Tian, you look down on me too much! I\u2019m from the Yu family, and nobody in the family gives up halfway!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Ling Tian stood up. \u201cFrom today you shall begin the first phase. Every morning, you have to produce three paintings with a certain character and pass Chen\u2019er\u2019s or my evaluation. If you fail then you have to redraw! In the afternoon, you\u2019ll cover your eyes with a piece of black cloth and redraw the three paintings. Only when I deem you fit to have passed the first level can you then go on to the second level.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BIngYan couldn\u2019t help but take in a breath of cold air, \u201cThree paintings with character? Redraw if I fail? Cover my eyes and draw?? Are you planning to reap my life? How is this possible for a human?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScared?\u201d Ling Tian replied in a considerate tone. \u201cIf you\u2019re scared then you can forget it. That time, Chen\u2019er also did the same thing, and even did it perfectly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s scared of whom?! Since sister Ling Chen can do it, so can I!\u201d Yu BingYan glared at Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood! Since you\u2019re not afraid, then Ling Chen will be your superior from today onwards. If you can\u2019t complete your task for the day, then Ling Chen will tell you what your punishment is!\u201d Ling Tian put an end to the topic!</p><br/><p>As such, he could use this chance to develop a strong foundation in painting for Yu BIngYan, then use this to develop a martial skill. With Ling Chen by her side to guide and protect her, it was killing two birds with one stone.</p><br/><p>The two ladies immediately agreed, looking at each other and smiling. Ling Chen, of course, understood Ling Tian\u2019s intentions in letting her do this, so her smile appeared weird. Ling Tian shot her a glare before coughing twice to hide it. Realizing that his objective had been met and that he had nothing else to do, he sat back down, before suddenly springing up as he remembered something. Turning to Yu BingYan he said, \u201cYan\u2019er, now that you\u2019re considered at the threshold, remember this. Whatever you draw in the morning should be with your heart and those in the afternoon, with intent! When you have reached the stage of having the heart but not the intention, that is when your Dao has reached the small success stage! These words on heart and intent are similar to the martial arts books, so you can slowly sift them out and learn. There are myriad beings and Daos in the world, with countless paths for everyone to walk, but all roads eventually lead to the same end. Remember this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan was long aware that Ling Tian was a hidden expert of the martial way and definitely wouldn\u2019t take his words as mere gibberish. She only mumbled to herself, \u201cHaving the heart but not the intent\u2026?\u201d She seemed to have been thrown into deep contemplation.</p><br/><p>A pretty maid walked over at this point, \u201cYoung noble, Madam requests your presence in the hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian straightened himself, asking, \u201cWhat is it regarding?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe NanGong Family Head, NanGong TianLong has already arrived, asking specifically to see you.\u201d The maid timidly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Was all Ling Tian replied with before seating himself back down. \u201cNanGong TianLong specifically asked for me? Must I show him face now? What a joke! Just because he wants to see me, I\u2019ve got to run over like a dog? Since when did the NanGong Family have such a big face?\u201d</p><br/><p>The maid stared in shock. For someone of NanGong TianLong\u2019s identity, secretly coming over to Sky Bearing, personally coming over to the Ling Family, and \u2018requesting\u2019 to see the young noble, how much of an honor was that! However, their young noble seemed to totally not reciprocate that kindness!</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and tell the NanGong Family head that I\u2019m waiting over here for him, and ask him to come over to find me.\u201d Ling Tian continued in a lazy tone. Since he\u2019s already delivered himself to my doorstep, haha, might as well go all the way!</p><br/><p>The maid hesitated a little, not moving, instead stammering, \u201cBut the Madam said\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian glared at her, \u201cGo! Now!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Madam of the Ling Family, Chu Ting\u2019er, was even more confused over this whole situation. The head of the NanGong Family, one of the Eight Great Families, actually came over to visit them and was even courteous and polite to her! Luckily, her name as Goddess of Fortune put her above the rest of the ladies, and while having some small talk with this big shot, she constantly looked at the door, wondering why that brat wasn\u2019t here yet.</p><br/><p>While both of them were talking, they could tell that the other party was already showing signs of impatience, yet had no choice but to continue talking, making both of them equally depressed! His coming to Sky Bearing was supposed to be a secret, and coming over to visit Ling Tian was even more under wraps, so why did the Ling Family not feel as though this was an important matter! To even have the maid dilly-dallying along, how could the news of him stay under wraps?</p><br/><p>Before long, the maid sent to report the news came rushing over. \u201cWhere\u2019s your young noble? Why is he not here?!\u201d Seeing that she only came alone, Chu Ting\u2019er asked with a furious expression.</p><br/><p>The maid could only stammer, \u201cYoung noble said, young noble said\u2026\u201d Sneaking a glance at her Madam\u2019s expression, she didn\u2019t dare to continue.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They could hear that this voice belonged to Yu ManLou\u2019s wife, the current empress! Just what would happen to make the usually steady empress so flustered?</p><br/><p>With a loud bang, the door was flung open and a middle-aged woman dashed in with a gust of wind trailing behind her. With her speed, it is obvious that her martial arts weren\u2019t weak either.</p><br/><p>\u201cEmperor\u2026 the eunuchs and maids are revolting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s body shook. How can this be possible? A bunch eunuchs and weak palace maids know how to revolt? It was both impossible and illogical!</p><br/><p>Before Yu ManLou could even ask what was going on, he heard a commotion from the outside. In the imperial palace, a couple of places were smoking and on fire. Miserable shrieks, quarreling, and fighting could be heard all around.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou flew into a rage and roared, \u201cI am going to take a look!\u201d He then turned around and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going as well!\u201d Yu ManTian couldn\u2019t be at ease and followed behind Yu ManLou.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou looked at him silently and didn\u2019t say a thing. The two brothers then walked out one after another.</p><br/><p>On the outside, the entire palace had already fallen into chaos. Fighting could be seen everywhere and those revolting eunuchs and maids all had a demented look on their faces. They did not have any weapons on their hands and they were fighting with their teeth and nails. They charged forward valiantly and faced the skilled guards of the palace as though they were mad. Perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to say \u2018as though they were mad\u2019 because they were truly mad!</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir minds have been thrown into chaos!\u201d Yu ManLou could tell with a single glance. At the same time, he had an inexplicable doubt in his heart. With the sheer size of the palace, who would have the power to bewilder the minds of so many eunuchs and maids together? Furthermore, their situation was so severe!</p><br/><p>During this short moment when Yu ManLou was pondering, a large change occurred again!</p><br/><p>While the situation was chaotic, the guards were able to easily suppress the chaos. After all, those creating the chaos almost had no strength whatsoever. All the eunuchs and maids were caught and thrown to the corner of the wall in a pile. If not for their numbers and crazed antics, the chaos would have long been suppressed. However, the situation was gradually getting under control.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a change occurred.</p><br/><p>Just when a guard pushed a maid down onto the ground, his body suddenly paused for a moment before he let out a roar to the heavens. His eyes turned red as though he had turned crazy and he turned around abruptly.</p><br/><p>The guard beside him who was his brother of many years cried out, \u201cWang San, what\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang San\u2019s eyes were completely red and he did not respond to his brother. After struggling with himself for a short while, he suddenly unsheathed his blade and cleaved his best brother into two with a loud roar!</p><br/><p>A series of gasps sounded!</p><br/><p>That Wang San held up his bloodstained blade and looked at the fellow guards around him with a ferocious gaze. He then let out a loud roar and waved his blade around without bothering who was around him. In just a short while, there were many who were injured!</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him quickly! He has gone crazy! Kill him without mercy!\u201d Yu ManLou ordered.</p><br/><p>A dozen of blades immediately flashed and Wang San burst out laughing without bothering to avoid the blades. At the same time,he swung the blade in his hand down and cleaved a nearby guard into two. At the same time, his own body was diced into pieces by the incoming blades.</p><br/><p>All the guards panted heavily and were still in shock. They did not understand why something so queer could happen.</p><br/><p>Amid the heavy panting, a few of them began an irregular panting as they gasped for air and their eyes turned red. Finally, they had also become deranged like Wang San and mercilessly attacked their companions!</p><br/><p>After noticing their oddities, the guards around them already placed their guards up and thus these few deranged individuals did not cause much damage before being slashed down.</p><br/><p>Very slowly, the irregular breathing began spreading among the guards like a plague\u2026</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou suddenly circulated all of his inner qi and with his face ashen, he let out an earth-shattering roar. When everyone present was shaken by the roar, Yu ManLou\u2019s figure shot out. A series of banging sounds could be heard and all the guards were sent flying with a single palm. He used sufficient strength to ensure that they were rendered immobile without any threat to their lives.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s face was calm and he ordered the few XianTian experts behind him, \u201cWith this chaos being so widespread, there must be a problem with the water source. All of you must take control of the imperial kitchen. From now on, no one will be allowed to consume any food or water. At the same time, order everyone who has inner qi to gather over! All of you must act quickly! Gather all of the imperial physicians as well and ask if they have any plan to stop this mess! Hurry up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Knowing that no delay would be allowed, they sped away quickly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat powerful means!\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s face was ashen, \u201cThey were actually able to cause so many to fall prey to their means without anyone noticing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian was completely dumbfounded. With his brain, he still could not figure out what was going on, \u201cBig brother, what is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is going on?\u201d Yu ManLou glared at him, \u201cIf I am not wrong, the entire imperial palace has fallen prey to a strange medicine. The guards have martial arts and so the effects are delayed. Thankfully this started happening with those who didn\u2019t have martial arts so we have some buffer time. If not, there wouldn\u2019t be a Yu Family tonight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is actually so serious!\u201d Yu ManTian gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you still suspecting me? Look over there?\u201d Yu ManLou bellowed, \u201cThat Wang San lost his mind and actually killed his own brother! If both me and you also fall into such chaos, will the Yu Family still exist?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian was dumbfounded and could not say a thing.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou remained calm and he gave a series of orders. He knew that time was tight. The moment there was a delay, there would be no turning back!</p><br/><p>His methods were resolute. The moment he noticed something was wrong, he immediately knocked out all of the guards and gathered the experts of the Yu Family. They then began treating the injured ones.</p><br/><p>After all of the orders were given, Yu ManLou let out a long sigh. Currently, the only thing left to do was wait.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou then looked at his third brother with a complicated gaze, \u201cThird brother, do you see all of these? These are the methods others have employed on our Yu Family. What do you think about these methods? Are they righteous?! This is war! A battle where no method would be spared!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d Yu ManTian opened his mouth but could not say a single word. At this moment, Yu ManTian still could not react to what had just happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is impossible to attain such a frightening effect by relying on outside forces alone. There are definitely spies in the Yu Family!\u201d Yu ManLou snorted coldly. The more complicated things were, the calmer Yu ManLou would be. He then took two steps forward and said, \u201cClose the city gates. From now on, no one is allowed to leave the city!\u201d</p><br/><p>A White Jade expert beside him acknowledged the order and left.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the entire palace was filled with silence with the smell of blood all around. Despite it being in the bright daylight, the place seemed extremely creepy.</p><br/><p>On the outside, the chaos gradually spread in all directions and the whole Bright Jade City fell into a mess. Fire could be seen all around from all over the city as though the end of the world had arrived.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou approached the window with his face cold.</p><br/><p>As the commotion approached the palace, fighting could suddenly be heard outside the palace.</p><br/><p>A yellow dressed leader sprinted in and knelt on the ground, \u201cReporting to your majesty, for some reason, the second prince deployed his troops and is attacking the palace!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?!\u201d Yu ManLou, Yu ManTian, and the empress cried out in surprise!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou had ordered that all the guards with a cultivation beneath the Blade Jade grade to be tied up and await treatment. In the palace, there were less than a hundred guards at this moment. Why would there be a revolt at this time?</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou turned around with frightening killing intent in his brows! It wouldn\u2019t matter if this was anyone else, but to think that his own son would also revolt! At this moment?!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou did not say a word and walked out.</p><br/><p>A figure flashed and the empress spread out her arms to block him, \u201cYour Majesty, you know that the prince\u2026 he may have been drugged\u2026 he isn\u2019t in the right frame of mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe can attack the palace because he isn\u2019t in the right frame of mind? He can attack his father? He is truly capable!\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s face was frosty. \u201cIf not for his mind being set on the throne, why would he attack the palace at this moment? Hmph! Not in the right frame of mind? The more he isn\u2019t in the right frame of mind, the more unforgivable his crimes! Move aside!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the empress still blocking him, Yu ManLou\u2019s face remained cold. All of a sudden, his palm struck out on the empress\u2019 cheek and sent her flying thirty feet away. Yu ManLou then continued walking towards the exit of the palace!</p><br/><p>\u201cStop big brother!\u201d Yu ManTian quickly flew forward to block the way, \u201cHow can you be so rash in this matter? You know that this isn\u2019t the character of my nephew! Are you going to punish him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou looked at Yu ManTian with the blazing flames of rage in his eyes, \u201cThe entire world can go against me or kill me apart from a few individuals! You and second brother cannot! My son\u2026 all the more cannot!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut even if you want to punish him, you have to first cure him of the poison!\u201d Yu ManTian had already forgotten about his previous displeasure and was anxious to the point his head was full of sweat, \u201cIf you\u2026 if you\u2026\u201d He was shocked by the words that were about to come out from his mouth. Even with his carefree personality, the words \u2018kill him\u2019 truly shocked him!</p><br/><p>That was his big brother\u2019s biological son!</p></div>\n</div>"}

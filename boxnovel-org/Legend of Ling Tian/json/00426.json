No matter how outstanding your aptitude is, you can\u2019t do a thing about it, and the quicker you cultivate, the higher the risk of a cultivation deviation! This was something I happened to overhear by accident. Right now, for you to rely on this crippled formula to reach the ninth layer, that\u2019s already a miracle! However, this is also your peak, because if you follow the formula to break through to the tenth layer, you\u2019re likely to suffer a backlash!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian blew out a breath of air, before saying in a calm manner, \u201cSo that\u2019s the case.\u201d Then he fell silent. No wonder he always felt that the formula had some problems with the cultivation. With his own heaven-defying talent, as well as his high perception, he had memorized many different cultivation formulas and cross-referenced from there every time he came across something that he didn\u2019t understand. This allowed him to take the alternative route in order to progress further, but as the formula became more profound, Ling Tian also became more helpless, finally plateauing before the tenth layer!</p><br/><p>Li Xue actually saw this as a matter worth profiteering from and wanted to use this chance to send him into a panic. But seeing his calm reaction, she couldn\u2019t help but feel unbearably disappointed, and pouted as she grumbled, \u201cAren\u2019t you the least bit nervous? Your martial arts might not ever improve further in your lifetime!\u201d</p><br/><p>A hint of laughter appeared at the corners of Ling Tian\u2019s mouth, \u201cIf someone else had told me this, I would definitely be worried because I pay a lot of attention to my own cultivation! However, since this is you, not only am I not worried, but I\u2019m instead more relaxed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd why so?\u201d Li Xue felt curious, that Ling Tian would actually have such a unique way of thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI recall in the past that the women of our family were not allowed to come into contact with the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula. The formula was one that would only be passed down to the men. Thus, you should have had no chance to come into contact with the formula, not to mention understanding the profundities within it.\u201d Ling Tian smirked, \u201cHowever, not only do you understand the deficiencies within it, but you\u2019re even proficient in the most mystical movement technique of our Divine Shocking Dragon Formula. Lass, so how long are you gonna wait before you pass me the actual formula?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would you be sure that I have the actual formula?!\u201d Li Xue jumped up in fright like a kitten whose tail had been stepped on. \u201cI don\u2019t have it, don\u2019t have it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to be in such a hurry to explain, to explain is to cover up, and to cover up means there exists some truth! You don\u2019t have it? If you didn\u2019t have it, then would you purposefully say it to make me panic?\u201d Ling Tian mocked. \u201cAs if! Lass, even after so many years, the moment you point your butt out I know\u2026\u201d 1</p><br/><p>Li Xue immediately covered his mouth, her face red as she screamed, \u201cOkay, okay, you win this time! Don\u2019t talk anymore, this mouth of yours is so incredibly dirty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sniggered as he replied, \u201cI wanted to say that the moment you point your butt out I\u2019ll know which direction you\u2019re moving towards. What did you think I was gonna say? Aiya, your mind is really unhealthy these days.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLING TIAN!!!!!\u201d Li Xue stomped her feet in apoplectic rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm? Do you have something to tell me?\u201d Ling Tian shrugged his shoulders at her suggestively.</p><br/><p>Li Xue let out a defeated sigh as she replied, \u201cI must say, you were more of a gentleman in your past life. Right now, you\u2019re an utter hooligan from head to toe!\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold expression passed over Ling Tian\u2019s face as he snorted, \u201cGentleman? If I didn\u2019t insist on maintaining that darned act of a gentleman in my past life, the Ling Family would have long become my territory! How else would I have landed in such a pathetic scenario, and how else would I have ended up here? Those that deserve death the most in the world are those f**king gentlemen or those so-called great heroes! Their deaths are all asked for, because they display all their weaknesses in front of their enemies and opponents, trusting them to be as fair as them. It\u2019s no wonder that they die! Don\u2019t link those main characters in those novels with reality!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue fell silent, and only whispered after a long while, \u201cI definitely am not so naive, but, in the past you were definitely a great hero, a true gentleman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian barked out a bitter laugh, \u201cAre you praising me? This is worse than pointing your finger and cursing me. You might as well call me a martyr for the masses! In this life, I refuse to be a hero and a gentleman anymore, I want to be the dictator, ruling over everything with an iron fist!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue giggled, before placating him, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s not dwell on this topic. I\u2019ll now recite the things I know regarding the missing points of the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula. While you\u2019ve already reached the Ninth Layer, because of the gaps in the formula, your meridians are bound to have been damaged. The good part is that you\u2019ve been using the purest XianTian energy from your mother\u2019s womb to cultivate, and hence these injuries can be quickly mended. However, if you are to continue cultivating the erroneous method, then there will come a point where your meridians can\u2019t take it and break down. By that time, it would be too late! If that happens you will need to cultivate from scratch again. This matter should be done as early as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>In response, Ling Tian only laughed, \u201cNow\u2019s as good as time as any. There\u2019s no need to rush it though, you can just write it down for me. This would be less troublesome, and when the time comes, I only need to pick up and book to read and practice, so much easier!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s eyes opened wide as she huffily said, \u201cYou really know how to take advantage of people, oh great noble Ling! Are you treating this lady here as your servant girl? This is too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only to be met with a grin from Ling Tian, \u201cTreat you as a servant girl? Oh my, I wouldn\u2019t dare! However, we do have a lot of matters on hand currently, and this problem is something that will require a long period of time. Do you think I can finish recultivating in a day or so? If that\u2019s the case, you really look up to me too much, as though I\u2019m a god!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue furrowed her brows and thought about it. After all, she was also a practitioner and could understand the meaning of Ling Tian\u2019s words. The reason why she urged Ling Tian was that she was mainly worried about his body. However, Ling Tian was not someone who didn\u2019t know his priorities, thus if he decided to alter his cultivation at a later date, Li Xue had no objections. However, she spoke again, \u201cBut you will need to slowly patch up your mistakes, one at a time from now onward.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat goes without saying! You think I\u2019m fearless about death?!\u201d Ling Tian immediately agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen will we be leaving here? Where are we headed to first then?\u201d Looking at her surroundings, Li Xue let out a wistful expression. After all, this was the \u2018house\u2019 she grew up in!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian took in a sharp breath, and calmly spoke, \u201cWe can\u2019t go to Sky Bearing for the time being, firstly is because the martial order has not ended, and so long as I can\u2019t pinpoint the location of Justice we can\u2019t relax, because his capabilities are too out of this world! Secondly, Ling Chen and Ling Jian have just started the plan, and if I return that would be wasting their efforts. Thirdly, the Xiao Family, as well as those from Above Heavens have definitely not given up on me, so why not bring them on a wild goose chase and at the same time visit my old friends the Yu and DongFang Families? As for the fourth point\u2026\u201d Ling Tian stroked his chin and let out an evil smile, \u201cI\u2019ve never had the chance to really play in my ten odd years here. That\u2019s sullying the tag of \u2018number one silkpants\u2019 that I have! I\u2019ll take this time to have a vacation then, and play all I can!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVacation? Play all you can?!\u201d Li Xue burst into laughter. \u201cWhat a vacation this great noble Ling is having. How is running around escaping from the entire world wanting to kill you considered a vacation? You had better not shoot yourself in the foot, in the event that the eighteen experts from Above Heavens catch up to you, that would really be considered as \u2018playing all you can\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrap me? If they really can do that, then it would be their lucky day! You think that I\u2019ll play fairly with them like that fool Justice? What a joke! If I don\u2019t play them to death, my name isn\u2019t Ling Tian!\u201d Ling Tian let out a raucous laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201d Li Xue nodded her head in agreement, \u201cUnder your innumerable traps, this group will have to worry more about their lives than yours! Oh yes, how exactly did Justice escape from all your traps, given your skill in hidden weapons? Did you actually hold back?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not the case. I threw a few of my trump cards just on Justice already! This guy might be a fool, but he is an adorable one who has unimaginable strength and skill. If he even thought of playing dirty, I estimate that even with three of me, I would still end up dead!\u201d Ling Tian shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust based on the battle by the hillside, he indeed has a frightening strength, far surpassing anybody of our generation. That\u2019s right, have you already calculated your moves? Are you really planning to open up a path of slaughter? Aren\u2019t you afraid that if you kill too many people, then it will end up offending even Heaven itself?\u201d Li Xue questioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cOffending heaven?! Hahaha\u2026\u201d Ling Tian burst into laughter, only stopping to catch a breath after a long while, \u201cWhen a man takes action, he will definitely be ruthless. Work and morals are two opposing sides, unrelated to each other! If I\u2019m supposed to kill, then I\u2019ll be merciless. Never pausing in my job even after a thousand autumns, immersing myself in slaughtering\u2026 every three steps I take, I will kill one. The heart stops but my hands won\u2019t. Blood flows for ten thousand miles, and corpses pile up like a thousand mountains\u2026 Killing one is a sin, but ten thousand makes me a hero. If I can slaughter nine hundred thousand, then I\u2019ll be a hero among heroes. As a hero among heroes, my path is different. I\u2019ve seen through the righteousness of a millennium, but today I\u2019ll show off my awe and influence. I\u2019ll choose infamy over a good reputation, my heart does not reprimand me for the millions I\u2019ve killed. I would rather teach the masses to gnash their teeth in hate of me than to have none knowing about me. Cast your eyes over the history of the past few millennia, which heroes have not been murderers? \u2026 hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Following a long laugh, Ling Tian strode in front, his skinny figure bringing about an aura of disaster, of bloodshed and cruelty! Gazing at his back, Li Xue stood dumbly on the spot for a moment, before twisting her body and catching up. The two of them traversed quickly, disappearing past a corner.</p><br/><p>Among the varied mountains and the verdant foliage, there existed a nameless hill with a huge hole. Both of them were witnesses to a scene of battle among the absolute experts on this land!</p><br/><p>Northern Wei, Yu Family, Martial Pointer Pavilion.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou stood with a heavy expression in front of the window. The weather outside was raging, haze covering the scenery, and a torrential downpour lashed through the area. It was akin to the current political scene of Northern Wei, with the rains and winds of chaos striking in all directions!</p><br/><p>While the Imperial Court of Northern Wei having collapsed in a single night was a horrifying incident, it wasn\u2019t a big affair to the supervisor of Bright Jade City. So long as the Yu Family existed, there was no difference in having an Imperial Court or not. After the climactic battle where the Northern Wei troops were almost totally wiped out, the reputation of the Northern Wei Imperial Court had received a great hit, with its prestige falling into the gutter!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

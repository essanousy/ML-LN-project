With the relationship between Family Head Xiao FengHan and Old Master, there will be a 50% chance of people believing this rumor. At the very least, it would create unrest in Southern Zheng and destroy all hopes of Southern Zheng forming an alliance with the Xiao Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>A cunning smile could then be seen on Meng LiGe\u2019s face. \u201cThe moment the Xiao Family makes their move, we will spread the news that young noble Ling has successfully killed the Martial Order Medallion owner. It won\u2019t matter if the Xiao Family doesn\u2019t dare to spread rumors about young noble being killed, but if they do so, the effects of both rumors will cancel out. If the Xiao Family retreats without a battle, Young Noble Ling\u2019s name would be renowned over the continent and the prestige of our Ling Family would be raised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s eyes lit up brightly and she nodded her head profusely. The moment Meng LiGe mentioned these two ideas, she had already begun formulating her own thoughts on them and also how she could ensure that the plan was carried out smoothly. If Meng LiGe\u2019s plan could be carried out successfully, not only would the Ling Family not suffer any losses, the prestige of the Ling Family would be increased to a never before seen level. Ling Chen never imagined that the news that she was frightened about could be so easily resolved by Meng LiGe with just a simple plan. At this moment, Ling Chen no longer had any doubts about Meng LiGe\u2019s wisdom.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird, we must gather the strength of the bandits in the east. According to what I know, there should be two groups of bandits in the east right? With each group being about three thousand men strong?\u201d Meng LiGe asked with a bit of uncertainty. All of these forces across the continent were Ling Tian\u2019s top secret forces and the biggest secret in the Courtyard. Meng LiGe only vaguely knew about them and about the existence of these forces. However, there weren\u2019t any records of these forces in the Courtyard and he could only make a guess.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian responded with \u2018Mmm\u2019 before explaining, \u201cThere is only one group which is about one thousand men strong. However, they are all elites. I transferred the other group to the territory where General Shen is stationed to aid him. Besides that, in case DongFang JingLei goes rogue, that group would be the hidden trump card to deal with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Meng LiGe shut his eyes and replied, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, my original plans must be amended slightly. However, even if we can\u2019t use these thousand men to steal the enemy\u2019s supplies, we would be able to use them to disrupt the supply transportation routes of the enemy. If Xiao FengYang does not make a move, there isn\u2019t a need for them to make a move. But the moment Xiao FengYang\u2019s army moves out, this group of bandits must begin their harassment operation. They can choose to kill, burn or even destroy the roads to create a shortage of food within the Xiao Family\u2019s army. Even if they can only delay the supplies for a few days, they must make it happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe chuckled, \u201cAs long as the supplies of the Xiao Family can be delayed for more than three days, we can spread rumors about the destruction of the Xiao Family\u2019s supply warehouse to throw their soldiers into chaos.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrilliant!\u201d Ling Tian clapped his hands, \u201cIf the morale of the troops is unstable, we can use assassinations or arson to cause a mutiny.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Meng LiGe laughed, \u201cBesides that, we must ensure that DongFang JingLei gathers his forces during this period of time to openly engage the Eastern Zhao imperial family. At that time, even if the Xiao Family has the intention to form an alliance with Eastern Zhao, Eastern Zhao would not have the spare soldiers to deal with us. Furthermore, the 150,000 soldiers that General Shen has is sufficient to ensure that Eastern Zhao does not make any rash moves!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOn top of that, we can openly send a diplomatic group to the Wu Empire to befriend them.\u201d Meng LiGe chuckled cunningly, \u201cWe only need to send them some silk and leather without doing anything else and it would be enough to make Southern Zheng and the Xiao Family suspicious and on edge. After all of these arrangements, we can then sit back and relax! At that time, we can focus on retaliating against the Xiao Family\u2019s forces.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble and Ling Jian can then lead the elites of our Courtyard out in three different directions. If the Xiao Family really dares to send their elites to infiltrate into Sky Bearing, we will make sure that they don\u2019t return alive. It wouldn\u2019t matter if Xiao FengYang doesn\u2019t make a move, but the moment he makes his move, we can make use of this opportunity to chase him back to his hometown!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like advisor Meng does not intend to let me off. Would it be a crime for me to peacefully rest for a few days? Why is everyone so keen on chasing me out?\u201d Ling Tian joked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe capable must be in charge of more.\u201d Meng LiGe stroked his beard and smiled, \u201cWith young noble\u2019s abilities to fight Justice, would there be anyone in the world capable of dealing with young noble? This Meng is naturally at ease with young noble taking action personally.\u201d As he said that, Meng LiGe\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cIt\u2019s also fine if young noble does not wish to go out. As long as young noble makes an announcement to the world and ascends the throne, you would naturally not need to go out. Since the ancient times, there has never been an emperor out on an assassination mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019s best for me to go.\u201d Ling Tian laughed bitterly, \u201cGrandfather and father are both extremely healthy. For Mister Meng to suggest that I ascend the throne, aren\u2019t you pushing me into the fire? Just a single crime of being unfilial to my parents is enough for the world to launch an attack at Sky Bearing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really don\u2019t understand your family.\u201d Meng LiGe shook his head and sighed. \u201cThe three of you choose to leave the throne empty and avoid it like the plague. How baffling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed bitterly. His grandfather Ling Zhan was already old and did not have thoughts of ascending the throne. With his father\u2019s personality, his father would probably fly into a rage upon ascending to the throne and expel all the civil officials in the court and run the country with the military. Besides that, an emperor needs to have concubines and with his Mother in control, his father would never dare to ascend to the throne because of that. With two generations of his elders still alive, wouldn\u2019t it be akin to cursing his elders an early death if Ling Tian ascended to the throne? Such a taboo was something that Ling Tian would never commit. Thus, the throne was temporarily left empty\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cErr, Mister Meng, it is best for you to continue.\u201d Ling Tian laughed dryly and wiped off his sweat. Besides that, Ling Tian would lose all of his freedom the moment he ascended to the throne. Ling Tian still wanted to lead a carefree life for a few more years\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Meng LiGe looked at Ling Tian and could not help but burst out laughing. After thinking for a moment, a barely discernible smile could then be seen on his face. \u201cAs long as young noble is able to eliminate the elites of the Xiao Family that have infiltrated into Sky Bearing, Xiao FengYang would be surrounded from all directions by our multi-pronged strategy. Regardless of how many tricks and plans he has up his sleeves, he would have no choice but to make a retreat. At that time, young noble\u2019s plans for Southern Zheng can also be carried out. Without any reinforcements, Southern Zheng should change their surname to Ling in less than ten months. With us conquering Southern Zheng and DongFang JingLei supporting us in Eastern Zhao, both our armies can gather together to swallow Eastern Zhao. At that time, only the final battle with the Xiao Family would be left and half the continent would be within our reach.\u201d</p><br/><p>If this plan was carried out properly, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for them to destroy Xiao FengYang\u2019s army. However, Meng LiGe\u2019s plan did not seem to include destroying Xiao FengYang\u2019s army. Ling Chen could not help but to doubtfully ask, \u201cDoes advisor mean that even if we have the chance to wipe out Xiao FengYang, we should not take it but allow him to leave? Wouldn\u2019t we be allowing the tiger to return to the hills?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Meng LiGe looked at Ling Chen with praise before explaining, \u201cThe Xiao Family is the number one financial magnate and even has the support of Above Heavens. This is not the time for us to engage in an all-out battle with them. Besides that, they have sent out 300,000 soldiers this time around and if we were to wipe out Xiao FengYang\u2019s army, the Xiao Family would definitely retaliate in full force. At that time, even if we are able to attain victory, it would be a Pyrrhic one. This would affect our plans with Southern Zheng and Eastern Zhao as well and if they were to interfere with our battle with the Xiao Family, we may end up losing. Thus, this isn\u2019t the best time to deal with the Xiao Family and even if they were already in our mouth, we would have to spit them out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe then let out a profound sigh, \u201cThe situation can change drastically in just an instant and we cannot expect too much from DongFang JingLei. If the situation is disadvantageous towards us, DongFang JingLei may very well stab us in the back. The most important thing for us to do now would be to settle Southern Zheng before the Yu Family swallows up the Wu Empire! If the Yu Family succeeds before us, we would be leaving our backs open towards the enemy! Furthermore, this enemy is the most powerful one in the world! This is something that we must never allow to happen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMister\u2019s words are true.\u201d Ling Tian looked at Ling Chen, \u201cOne more thing\u2026 since I have already decided on making Xiao YanXue my woman, I have to make proper considerations when dealing with the Xiao Family. With regards to the upper echelons of the Xiao Family, it is best if I don\u2019t kill them. Since she is already my woman, I cannot throw her into endless grief and sandwich her between me and her family. Not just the Xiao Family, this would be the same for the Yu Family as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Yu Family can be destroyed! The Xiao Family can be destroyed! But I have to give Yu BingYan and Xiao YanXue an explanation. Just like how the two of them chose me as opposed to their family, I have the duty to ensure their happiness,\u201d Ling Tian said solemnly. \u201cThus, we have to be very careful with our actions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the others, we can do as the advisor has said and I do not have anything to add on. The military arrangements are very perfect and I am very satisfied.\u201d Ling Tian looked at Meng LiGe and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you young noble.\u201d Meng LiGe stood up and bowed. Ling Tian then replied with sincerity, \u201cAdvisor is too polite. If I do not trust advisor, why would I keep you here? Since I trust Military Advisor, I will not doubt any of your decisions.\u201d Ling Tian looked at Meng LiGe seriously, \u201cEven if it is wrong, I will not doubt!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

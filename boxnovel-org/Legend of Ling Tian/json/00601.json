He unleashed a flurry of blows, forcing the two elders into a dire situation before using two successive fist strikes to finish one off.</p><br/><p>A sudden \u201cAHHHHH\u201d sounded, as the eyes of Lei ZhenTian turned completely crimson! His eyes blazed as he stared at Ling Tian and his headscarf suddenly burst apart as he exploded with all his true energy! Even his clothes seemed to turn into scrap instantaneously and shot around in all directions.</p><br/><p>Waves of fury radiated from around him like the waves of the ocean, and everyone in all directions around him stumbled and were pushed away, forcibly creating an empty space of around a hundred feet!</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian stared at Ling Tian, his snow-white hair flying around him not unlike flames, as he pressured towards Ling Tian. A look of despair hung on his face, as he slowly enunciated, \u201cLing Tian, follow me down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian, this Family head of the Lei Family, had finally been forced by Ling Tian to the point where he destroyed indiscriminately!</p><br/><p>A wisp of a voice suddenly traveled into Ling Tian\u2019s ears, \u201cCareful, this is the highest level of the Lei Family\u2019s Heavenly Penta Lightning Sutra, the \u201cUnlimited Will of Heaven\u201d! It can instantly burn off all the life force together with the energy within their muscles, to transform it to their greatest strength. It can increase one\u2019s strength to more than five times their original if utilized to the maximum, but the weakness is that after that one punch, their bodies turn to ash. However, the might behind that one blow is undeniable.\u201d This was the voice of Justice!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sucked in a breath of cold air! To think that there actually existed such a tyrannical and domineering martial skill! If it was not for the information from Justice, he would have gone head-on against Lei ZhenTian, fully confident in his deeper reserves of internal energy. At that time\u2026</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian\u2019s capabilities were actually not weak, and even if they were considered to be a notch lower than Yu ManLou, he was definitely not as weak as he appeared to be. To have such a person\u2019s strength multiplied by five times, how could anyone fight with him? Even if it was Justice himself, he would not be able to go head-on!</p><br/><p>While this Unlimited Will of Heaven skill only existed for a single attack, and after the attack the person would disintegrate, this attack was enough to drag someone down to hell along with the attacker!</p><br/><p>No wonder that although the Lei Family was weaker than the Yu Family, they did not have any scruples about Justice, unlike how they felt against the Yu Family. As it turned out, they had such a final trump card on hand that could even send the top expert Justice to the grave with them!</p><br/><p>An abrupt increase of five times their original strength!</p><br/><p>For a XianTian realm expert to abruptly have an increase of five times their strength, what sort of realm would they have reached? Ling Tian never ever thought of that, and neither could he even imagine!</p><br/><p>He hatefully glared at Justice after hearing his advice. My brother, why did you not say this earlier? At this point, where everyone was engaged in battle all around them, this one strike would cause countless people to go to their graves together with the Lei Family head! Since there were not many Lei Family members remaining, those who accompanied him down would be those of the Ling Family!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian did not have the time to ponder this matter anymore, for he acutely felt that Lei ZhenTian had fully locked the space around him! The sudden realization of impending death loomed over him, causing his hair to stand on end!</p><br/><p>The imposing aura of Lei ZhenTian descended like the sky, causing Ling Tian to even have trouble breathing. This made him recall his past where he was bitten by a venomous snake when he was young, plunging him into the throes of death. In this lifetime, for Ling Tian, that was the first time he felt this!</p><br/><p>The surrounding air became viscous, and Ling Tian had the feeling as though he was wading through a swamp, with every step needing herculean strength. Droplets of cold sweat had already begun to form on his forehead.</p><br/><p>His originally peerless and intricate movement techniques now looked sluggish beyond compare, even worse when compared to someone in the elementary stage of learning. As he gradually felt the weight in his body increasing, this thought flashed past his mind, \u201cCould it be that I, Ling Tian, am destined to lose my life in my own base today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian cruelly smiled as he closed on Ling Tian. Inside his eyes, one could see his endless hatred and deep despair. Just like what Justice said, this was his final attack, and it combined all the cultivation of his entire life. This was literally going out with a bang! All of his energy was fused into his punch, including the vitality from his lifespan and every inch of muscle from his body!</p><br/><p>Only such a blow would qualify to kill Ling Tian, and would be able to kill him!</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian was confident of this attack, but the hatred he felt towards Ling Tian was not something that could be solved even with his death. Before he killed Ling Tian he wanted to play with him, using the cruelest way to deal with him! Even so, he still found it difficult to resolve the hatred in his heart! A pity, he only had this strength for one attack, and could not waste it however he wished.</p><br/><p>As such, Lei ZhenTian could only grasp the chance properly, savoring the feeling of controlling the world at this moment, and the beautiful feeling of murdering his enemy. Seeing Ling Tian having difficulty even moving, an immense feeling of satisfaction appeared in his heart.</p><br/><p>A grave aura hung stagnant in the surrounding air, and when Ling Jian, Li Xue and the rest discovered this danger, they used their utmost efforts to kill their way over to Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>The surrounding warriors of the Ling Family all drew their bows and shot out countless arrows towards Lei ZhenTian. However, he did not even bother to dodge, a ghastly smile on his face as he continued to slowly walk forwards. The arrows that landed on him looked like arrows landing on a rock, merely striking and dropping on the ground without leaving a single mark on his body.</p><br/><p>Everyone felt a wave of shock from this! What sort of martial skill was this, for it to be so domineering? He could be considered totally impervious to weapons! Let\u2019s not talk about seeing such a skill, nobody had even heard of such a skill existing. This was practically the stuff of legends!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s imposing figure started to sway as Lei ZhenTian closed in. The latter\u2019s aura was just like a towering mountain, pressuring and pressing down on him, as though trying to suffocate him. A sense of burning anxiety appeared in Ling Tian\u2019s heart, and he knew that if he continued along this line, the matter of him accompanying Lei ZhenTian down to his grave would become a sure thing. He had to think of a method to break away from his deadlock!</p><br/><p>The corners of his eyes glanced towards Justice, and he could not help but start cursing inwardly, This brother, if you\u2019re going to help, then help to the end! How am I going to deal with this attack?!</p><br/><p>However, Justice continued standing there like a statue, his expression as though watching a good show. Seeing Ling Tian look in his direction, his mouth curled up into a smile, and his right hand actually formed a fist punching the air as though he was cheering him on, before keeping it and going over to treat the others, completely ignoring him.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s the use in cheering me on?! Ling Tian was exasperated beyond belief. This was just like seeing your house on fire, yet having the attitude to continue watching your drama! Even if my words or expression offended you previously, how could you not be magnanimous and save me when my life is in danger?!! So much for being a lofty senior! But he suddenly came to his senses as he thought of an important point: Why did Justice not bother to assist him?</p><br/><p>How could Justice not bother to assist him? If he was willing to stand up in order to protect the Ling Family Courtyard, then all the more he would not wish for me to die! This\u2026 Ling Tian began to furiously ponder about this.</p><br/><p>Right now, Justice would not want Ling Tian to die. To put it in another way, Justice was the person who most did not want Ling Tian to die in this world! But if that was the case, since he was in such anger, how would he not choose to interfere? Why would he have the mentality of someone watching a show?</p><br/><p>There was only one conclusion that could be derived from this, and that was Justice was filled with confidence that Ling Tian would not fall here, that he had the strength to receive this particular strike! Furthermore, this was also the best chance for him to challenge his limits!</p><br/><p>But why would he be so confident towards him? What part of him would make Justice so confident in him?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian speedily ran through his repertoire of skills and abilities, but to his dismay, he realized that no matter what skill he had, they could not perform the job of reversing his current situation. So long as Lei ZhenTian\u2019s energy was still locked on him, then the moment he unleashed his Unlimited Will of Heaven, he would be able to cause mutual destruction!</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian was still absorbed in his memories, Lei ZhenTian had already walked to a distance of five steps away from him. As his cruel gaze fixed on Ling Tian\u2019s face, Lei ZhenTian had a satisfied expression amid his own despair.</p><br/><p>Engrossed in his memories, Ling Tian suddenly felt someone close in towards him, and the size of the person was close to his own. This close proximity made him a little uncomfortable, and while his brain continued to spin, his feet automatically moved and brought himself backward by two steps, and to the side by a step.</p><br/><p>Suddenly\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian seemed to have felt his body lighten up, and before his mind could process what was happening, he realized that he had regained his mobility. His actions of stepping back twice and once to the side had successfully allowed him to escape the lock Lei ZhenTian had imposed on him, and a comfortable sensation assaulted his whole body at this moment!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian exclaimed jubilantly in his heart, following which he immediately detected a wave of killing intent rushing towards him. Lei ZhenTian, upon seeing how easily Ling Tian had escaped his lock on the surrounding space, let out an inconsolable look of despair, before immediately rushing towards him for his final attack!</p><br/><p>An attack that was sure to spell death!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Ling Tian was still searching through his mind, Just what exactly happened? How did I break out of his lock in my muddleheaded state? How was this even achieved?\u2026</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian\u2019s figure flashed forward like a cruel death reaper under the five times increase in his strength. As he speedily drew near, Ling Tian\u2019s subconscious mind immediately made a decision to shift, and Lei ZhenTian\u2019s palm landed heavily on his shoulder instead. A gargantuan force that was similar to an imperial might that could not be resisted passed through and Ling Tian was struck flying, shooting out over seventy feet in an instant before slamming onto the ground.</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian was struck flying, his mental state was not in the least panicked. The moment he landed, he utilized the momentum to flash out another thirty feet, narrowly avoiding the successive nine palm strikes from Lei ZhenTian. The ground quaked as his palms went wide, causing the dust in the surroundings to fill the skies!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt his body become sluggish all of a sudden once again. He had been trapped once again by the suffocating space lock!</p><br/><p>His shoulder felt like it was about to shatter. Even with Ling Tian\u2019s ingenious movement technique, which even included a divine skill on relieving pressure and diverting force, he was still injured. Bear in mind that this skill had still worked to a certain extent even when he had faced off against Justice!</p><br/><p>This clearly showed just how tyrannical his \u201cUnlimited Will of Heaven\u201d skill of Lei ZhenTian was!</p></div>\n</div>"}

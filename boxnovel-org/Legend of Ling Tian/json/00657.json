With a loud roar, the lotus that he formed with his sword qi exploded prematurely. The boundless sword qi in the atmosphere gathered together and heartlessly shot towards Yu ManLou!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Shui WuBo\u2019s figure spun around quickly and his sword let out a sharp cry. He did not hope to harm Yu ManLou and only wished to protect himself. He set up a dense net of sword qi around him and with his inner qi imbued within his left palm, he sent out a few palm strikes to create a powerful whirlwind around him. This whirlwind was extremely destructive and it looked as though it was getting more and more ferocious by the moment.</p><br/><p>In that instant, it was as though Shui WuBo\u2019s body was surrounded by a mini twister. Everyone could visibly see that the twister had already been transformed into an azure flood dragon!</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo did not know what sort of move Yu ManLou was about to unleash but he could clearly feel that while it seemed like he would be able to block it, it was impossible for him to block it! These extremely contradictory thoughts had appeared in Shui WuBo\u2019s heart and so he used all of his strength without any hesitation!</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo\u2019s instinct was truly accurate. If he was a moment later, he would have definitely suffered a huge loss! However, despite his quick reactions, he was still a little bit late!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou had already penetrated into the endless sword net!</p><br/><p>Everyone took in a deep breath and held their breath!</p><br/><p>This was Yu ManLou\u2019s life-saving trump card! As an ambitious character, how could his final trump card be something simple? Thus, even if Ling Tian had the confidence to win against Yu ManLou, he was still extremely wary of Yu ManLou\u2019s final lifesaving trump card! Currently, it was time for Yu ManLou to reveal his cards!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou did not know that Ling Tian was also present in Heavenly Wind. If he knew, he would probably choose to tangle with Shui WuBo for three days and night without a victor emerging rather then taking out his trump card! In the world today, the person who deserved Yu ManLou using his trump card the most was none other than Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>Currently, with a few thousand people being present in the plaza, the only person who was capable of seeing all of Yu ManLou\u2019s moves clearly was probably Ling Tian! Even Ling Jian wouldn\u2019t be capable! As for the rest, there wasn\u2019t a need to even mention them.</p><br/><p>A loud clanging sound could be heard and a series of fists clashing could be heard. With a loud bang, two low grunts could be heard from the two individuals.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou and Shui WuBo clashed in mid-air before their figures separated.</p><br/><p>However, while they both took a few steps back, there was a difference between the two. Yu ManLou\u2019s retreat was casual and his movement technique was completely under his control. However, Shui WuBo was like a kite with its string snapped!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could clearly see that the moment Yu ManLou\u2019s sword came into contact with Shui WuBo\u2019s sword net, his left hand suddenly moved away from his sword\u2019s hilt. Following that, his left hand transformed into a pitch black color, a black even darker than black! His left palm then clashed together with Shui WuBo\u2019s left palm!</p><br/><p>The battle was originally in a stalemate but after Yu ManLou and Shui WuBo\u2019s palms collided, Ling Tian was dumbfounded!</p><br/><p>After this palm strike, Shui WuBo\u2019s left hand turned black rapidly and looked as though it was swelling up. After that, his palm returned back to its original color quickly. However, a black line rapidly traveled up Shui WuBo\u2019s arm!</p><br/><p>Right at that moment, Shui WuBo\u2019s originally nimble figure collapsed like a heavy rock!</p><br/><p>Venom!</p><br/><p>An extremely sharp venom!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s expression changed drastically!</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t shocked at the fact Yu ManLou used venom but astounded by the ferocity of the venom!</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo\u2019s inner qi had already reached the peak of the XianTian realm and his pure XianTian inner qi was sufficient to purge any venom in the world. Regardless of how ferocious the venom, as long as Shui WuBo had sufficient time, he would be able to force it out of his body!</p><br/><p>However, Shui WuBo was obviously unable to reject the venom on Yu ManLou\u2019s palm strike! Furthermore, the venom rapidly infiltrated his body and assaulted his heart! Shui WuBo\u2019s pure XianTian qi was completely unable to defend against it! It could not even delay the venom for the slightest bit of time!</p><br/><p>Just what kind of venom was this? How could it be so tyrannical?!</p><br/><p>If he was struck by such a palm strike, what would happen? Would he be able to protect himself from the venom?! Ling Tian\u2019s hair stood up on edge as he thought about this!</p><br/><p>If Shui WuBo was able to defend against the venom for a short moment, even if he fell prey to the venom in the end, Ling Tian would be confident of protecting himself against the venom. After all, his cultivation was far superior to Shui WuBo! Even if Shui WuBo wasn\u2019t able to defend against the venom, it didn\u2019t mean that he wouldn\u2019t be able to defend against it!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian could clearly see that Shui WuBo\u2019s XianTian qi was infiltrated without the slightest resistance. Furthermore, the venom disappeared in an instant without the slightest trace!</p><br/><p>Even with Ling Tian\u2019s experience of two lifetimes, he was actually unable to recognize this venom! It was far too frightening!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian burst out in a cold sweat. He knew that Yu ManLou\u2019s next target would definitely be him! In the world today, apart from Shui WuBo, there were only two others worthy for Yu ManLou to use such a venomous martial art! The first was the Martial Order Medallion owner, Justice, and the second was Ling Tian himself!</p><br/><p>Thinking about the last time he exchanged palm strikes with Yu ManLou, Ling Tian\u2019s head was filled with cold sweat. Thankfully, Yu ManLou\u2019s venomous martial art wasn\u2019t yet accomplished at that time! Otherwise, he would have probably been reduced to ashes already!</p><br/><p>At that time, he was truly too careless! It was truly too dangerous!</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo\u2019s face was filled with anger as he retreated pathetically with blood shooting out from his thighs and shoulder. His eyes were fixed on Yu ManLou and his face was flushed red. It looked as though he wanted to say something to Yu ManLou or curse at him!</p><br/><p>Blood also shot out from Yu ManLou\u2019s left chest and his originally black complexion returned to normal. He regained his scholarly elegance with a tinge of paleness on his face. Retreating with a somersault, the tip of his sword touched the ground and with the body of his sword curving, he used the sword as a spring and shot towards Shui WuBo like a brilliant rainbow!</p><br/><p>His sharp sword qi had immediately blocked the words that were about to come out from Shui WuBo\u2019s mouth! How could Yu ManLou allow Shui WuBo to voice his secret in public? This was his final trump card! Furthermore, it was one that could not be made public!</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo wanted to circulate his inner qi but the moment he tried circulating his inner qi, his face would turn black immediately before turning completely pale. He suddenly had a strange look in his eyes, with a look of mockery as though he was laughing at something. However, it looked as though it was also filled with emptiness.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, Shui WuBo\u2019s face glowed with the radiance of a glowing sun!</p><br/><p>His sword then jumped up like an agile snake as though it was a spiritual being. A dense qi then exploded forth from his sword qi. However, this time, the sword qi was not dispersed like before but was only locked onto Yu ManLou\u2019s chest!</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, after suffering from such a fatal venom and in the face of the sword that could take his life, Shui WuBo had finally achieved a breakthrough! He finally achieved the realm of his sword qi being reserved and finally made an accomplishment in the way of the sword which he had been pursuing his entire life!</p><br/><p>The breakthrough of his martial arts realm signified the many-fold increase in his strength! If he had achieved a breakthrough a moment earlier, even if there was another Yu ManLou, Shui WuBo would still be able to destroy them under his sword!</p><br/><p>It was a pity that his breakthrough was far too late and far too coincidental!</p><br/><p>While he could achieve a breakthrough in his realm, he was only able to unleash less than 1% of his newly found strength!</p><br/><p>With Yu ManLou\u2019s martial arts accomplishment, he would naturally be able to recognize Shui WuBo\u2019s breakthrough. He looked at Shui WuBo in the eyes and said softly, \u201cIt\u2019s too late!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou burst out into cold sweat. To think that Shui WuBo would make a breakthrough at this moment!</p><br/><p>Thankfully Shui WuBo only made a breakthrough at this moment!</p><br/><p>The goddess of luck was still on Yu ManLou\u2019s side!</p><br/><p>His longsword pierced straight into Shui WuBo\u2019s chest before Yu ManLou retreated quickly. Shui WuBo\u2019s final sword also brushed past his chest and left a deep scar on his chest!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t kill him!\u201d A loud roar sounded the instant Yu ManLou\u2019s sword penetrated Shui WuBo\u2019s chest. However, it was too late!</p><br/><p>The space of the entire Mount Vacant seemed to have contorted slightly and a dream-like figure appeared in the plaza. He held onto Yu ManLou\u2019s sword with his hand but the sharp sword was unable to harm his palm at all!</p><br/><p>Justice!</p><br/><p>However, everything was too late.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou maintained his scholarly appearance, let go of his sword and retreated with a smile.</p><br/><p>He allowed his sword to remain impaled into Shui WuBo\u2019s chest and heart!</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo\u2019s dying gaze suddenly began burning as he looked at Justice. He should not have been able to say a single word and his final life force had been taken away by Yu ManLou\u2019s final sword. But for some reason, his face suddenly turned red.</p><br/><p>He let out a weak cough and said softly, \u201cMartial \u2026 Order \u2026 Medallion \u2026 owner?\u201d While his voice was soft, it was filled with peace. He did not have any grievance in regards to Yu ManLou\u2019s despicable means but only had peace in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me,\u201d Justice replied calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026ah\u2026\u201d Shui WuBo\u2019s eyes lit up brightly before instantly turning dim. His eyes were then shut with a gentle smile on his face filled with peace and satisfaction!</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo was a martial arts fanatic all his life and his only entertainment in life was practicing his sword and martial arts. The only target in his life was the peak of the sword way! His only wish was to meet the biggest opponent in his heart who was also his biggest idol, Justice!</p><br/><p>Before his death, he was able to accomplish the two biggest desires of his life!</p><br/><p>He achieved a breakthrough in his sword way and saw Justice before his last breath. Furthermore, he also saw Justice using his unparalleled movement technique which was a realm that he could only dream of but never attain!</p><br/><p>His sword way had already attained the peak which he had dreamed of! While he had only captured a glimpse of that sword realm, he was already satisfied. Despite being defeated in battle by despicable means, Shui WuBo did not have any grievances!</p><br/><p>This was the final choice which he made as a warrior! Even if he died from a sneak attack, it was better than being alive but paralyzed on a bed!</p><br/><p>A martial arts fanatic, the First Elder of the Shui Family, Shui WuBo, dead!</p><br/><p>Justice placed Shui WuBo\u2019s body on to the ground and pulled Yu ManLou\u2019s sword out from Shui WuBo\u2019s chest. After taking a close look, he had already realized something odd about Shui WuBo\u2019s death. While Yu ManLou would be able to fool the entire world with his means, how would he be able to fool this martial arts and medicinal grandmaster? All of a sudden, he raised his head and glared at Yu ManLou with cold killing intent, \u201cFamily Head Yu, don\u2019t you think that you are a little despicable?\u201d It was as though he was interrogating a criminal!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou let out a casual smile and placed his hands behind his back as he replied calmly, \u201cThis is the generational battle between the Shui and Yu Family! For the past thousand years, this had always been the rule; the victor lives and the defeated shall perish! The battle shall only end in death! This rule was set by your Beyond Heavens! Does Mister Justice have any qualms?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice\u2019s eyes erupted with anger, \u201cDoes this rule include the use of despicable means?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable means?\u201d Yu ManLou let out a scholarly chuckle and replied without a tinge of anger, \u201cI wonder what Sir is referring to as despicable means? Is it this Yu\u2019s swordplay, palm arts or movement techniques? I would need Sir to give me some pointers!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Justice regained his cool and glared at Yu ManLou with his eagle eyes. With a powerful oppression, he said slowly, \u201cThis battle should not have ended in such an outcome. While Family Head Yu\u2019s final move is extremely powerful and can be said to be the peak of the sword way, it lacks the strength to finish Shui WuBo off in a single strike! But why did Shui WuBo lose all ability to retaliate after that attack? There must definitely be a reason behind this! This reason is definitely on you! This battle definitely wasn\u2019t fair! This result definitely wasn\u2019t fair either!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou chuckled and a look of mockery could be seen on his face, \u201cDoes Sir think that it would only be fair if this Yu dies under Shui WuBo\u2019s sword?\u201d He ignored everything else that Justice had said and purposely emphasized the words \u2018this wasn\u2019t fair\u2019. However, the more he did so, the more suspicious Justice was.</p><br/><p>Justice snorted coldly, \u201cThe generational battle has been going on for a thousand years and if the battle was a fair one, it wouldn\u2019t matter if Shui WuBo dies. However, if he dies under treacherous means, no one would be able to accept such an outcome of a powerhouse dying such a pitiful death. Especially when fighting an opponent of the same level! Family Head Yu, your methods are truly disappointing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou sneered, \u201cWe are having a life or death battle and not a casual spar! Shui WuBo has already died and the victor has been decided. The thousands present can be my witness! I wonder what does Sir mean by your words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice glared at Yu ManLou for a moment expressionlessly before saying, \u201cYu ManLou, I will definitely investigate this matter to the end!\u201d</p><br/><p>A look of grievance could be seen on Yu ManLou\u2019s scholarly appearance and he retorted with anger, \u201cSir can do whatever you wish! If there aren\u2019t any other instructions, it is time to announce the results!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a buzz like a mosquito could be heard by Justice\u2019s ears, \u201cOld brother, I want Shui WuBo\u2019s corpse. There will definitely be traces left behind and I may need your help later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice\u2019s face twitched slightly and he picked up Shui WuBo\u2019s body, \u201cLife and death have already been determined, what is the point of announcing the victor?\u201d He then carried Shui WuBo\u2019s body and walked away slowly.</p><br/><p>The members of the Shui Family were still in a state of shock and had yet to recover from it. Not a single one of them had actually attempted to stop Justice and request that Shui WuBo be buried in his own hometown. Shui WuBo was already at the peak of the entire Heavenly Wind and not to mention his death, not a single one of them had even imagined that he would lose! Even if his opponent was Yu ManLou!</p><br/><p>However, not only did he lose, he had lost in a completely unknown manner and died on the spot! This news was like thunder on a sunny day!</p><br/><p>Justice had actually arrived some time ago. With regards to this generational battle, his level of interest was no less than Ling Tian. He had hidden for a long time in the vicinity and commented on the battle from time to time as he watched with interest. However, it was a pity that no one had the fortune to hear his comments.</p><br/><p>He had long realized that something was wrong with the battle between Yu ManLou and Shui WuBo but he still didn\u2019t intend to take action. This was a life or death battle and even if Yu ManLou used poison or hidden weapons, there wasn\u2019t anything wrong with it! It wouldn\u2019t be much even if Shui WuBo died! In the battle between the two families, according to the records of Beyond Heavens, there were others who had used even more despicable and sinister means! This wasn\u2019t considered much.</p><br/><p>It was only when Shui WuBo achieved his final breakthrough that Justice was stirred! To someone like Justice who had yearned to find an opponent for all his life, Shui WuBo\u2019s breakthrough was extremely precious to him! With this breakthrough, Shui WuBo was already extremely near to Justice\u2019s realm!</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo who achieved a breakthrough already had the right to fight Justice!</p><br/><p>However, it was already too late. Justice was unable to stop Yu ManLou and Shui WuBo had died under Yu ManLou\u2019s sword! He had lost a rare opponent just like that! Thus, Justice was enraged!</p><br/><p>Seeing Justice carry Shui WuBo out, Ling Tian lost his interest in the following mixed battle. Currently, he was the most interested in Yu ManLou\u2019s venomous martial art which was already accomplished! This was something that could threaten his life!</p><br/><p>Perhaps only Shui WuBo\u2019s corpse would be able to provide him with an answer. Furthermore, Justice was the doctor with the greatest authority! Thus, he gave Ling Feng and the others an eye signal before secretly leaving to chase after Justice.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s arrangement for Ling Feng and the others was: After this battle was over, Yu BingYan shall be left behind in the Shui Family! She must not follow the Yu Family back! If not, who knows what kind of a sinister plot Yu ManLou would have. At this point, Ling Tian would not take any risks!</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan had already fulfilled her final responsibility as a member of the Yu Family! Since the Yu Family was heartless, then she would only have a single status! The woman of Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>I, Ling Tian, will never allow anyone to harm my woman! I will not even allow there to be any hidden threats!</p></div>\n</div>"}

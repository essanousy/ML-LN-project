If they were to combine their strengths, they could actually defeat Justice. She thought that it was because Ling Tian couldn\u2019t bring himself to trust her completely and thus chose to use his current method. Once their relationship got better, then it would be a piece of cake to handle this number one expert!</p><br/><p>However, following her witnessing the might of Justice\u2019s strength even at the distance of over a few hundred feet, she could now fully appreciate the dominance Justice held over everyone! The little lass finally began to show a little fear! She suddenly felt that for her to be able to trick Justice that day was all because of a fluke! And even more so, she finally understood why even though Ling Tian knew she was willing to go all out to support him, he still refused to clash head-on with his enemy!</p><br/><p>This sort of unparalleled strength, unrivaled on this world!</p><br/><p>This Martial Order Medallion owner was indeed too frightening to behold!</p><br/><p>Seeing Li Xue\u2019s extremely horrified appearance, Ling Tian immediately concluded that the shock this lass had experienced was definitely no small thing. He couldn\u2019t help but smirk to himself, but only let out a defeated smile as he spoke, \u201cSurprising, right? While most of the people in legends don\u2019t match up in reality, Justice is someone where his reputation can\u2019t compare to meeting him in person, more imposing in flesh than in legends! He\u2019s a really difficult opponent to handle, and at least in near future, both of us are not his match!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! This little sister here did not expect that this Martial Order Medallion owner could actually possess such earth-shattering might, Tian\u2019ge, why would such an expert bother to chase you? You\u2026 you..\u201d Right now, Li Xue didn\u2019t even try to hide her restraining fear towards Justice. However, displayed in her voice was not her fear of Justice, but rather a deep concern towards Ling Tian. This was because she could clearly feel that, with Justice\u2019s current cultivation, even if they were to work together, they would still not be his match. And with the request of the Martial Order Medallion, Ling Tian had to die no matter what! Did that mean Ling Tian had no chance to live whatsoever? This little lass began to worry!</p><br/><p>It was as though Ling Tian\u2019s safety was more important than her own!</p><br/><p>A sense of warmth entered Ling Tian\u2019s heart, as he smilingly gazed at Li Xue\u2019s worried expression. He couldn\u2019t resist stretching out his right hand, gently arranging her messed up hair as he warmly replied, \u201cI might not beat him currently in martial skills, but he is far from being capable enough to kill me! It\u2019s alright, he won\u2019t be able to kill me. Besides, you were thinking on a wrong path earlier on. That heaven and earth-shattering force just now might be scary, but\u2026 hehehe\u2026 silly lass.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what?\u201d Li Xue pressed on.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt takes two hands to clap, silly lass!\u201d Ling Tian laughed out as he began to walk again. \u201cIf the Above Heaven fellows did not use their full strength to receive his blow, while Justice might be unrivaled, he would still not be able to reach such a state! This is because that sort of strength is not something that a single person can actually unleash! So long as Justice is still by himself, he will never reach such a state!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s the case! Aiya, I\u2019m too stupid\u2026\u201dLi Xue immediately hung her head in dejection, \u201cThat makes sense too, a person\u2019s meridians have a limited capacity, and no matter how strong Justice is, the meridians can never continuously expand. With his current skill, if he were to imbibe twofold of his current strength, then his meridians would definitely explode, hahahaha\u2026\u201d Li Xue joyously laughed, before realizing that something was wrong. She turned her head, only to realize that Ling Tian had suddenly stopped, and curiously turned to look at him.</p><br/><p>He stood stock still in the middle of the plains, his eyes staring straight like lightning bolts! His eyes seem to hold a myriad of mysteries, and his face gradually grew stern.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Li Xue suddenly felt panicky. Could it be that she had accidentally said something wrong?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s mind was brewing. He did not know exactly what he was thinking about, he just felt a rumbling in his mind, a dizziness assaulting him, making him extremely uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s words might seem harmless, but as a listener, he would naturally deliberate over that.</p><br/><p>\u201cA person\u2019s meridians will always have a limit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA person\u2019s meridians will always have a limit.\u201d</p><br/><p>This simple sentence echoed in his brain again and again!</p><br/><p>Simple, foreign yet familiar! As though this was a principle he had not heard in a long time!</p><br/><p>A principle of his past life!</p><br/><p>Ever since he had descended upon this world, his contact with the various pugilists couldn\u2019t be said to have been little, to the point that he himself was responsible for the annihilation of almost half of the Eight Great Families. Even the number one expert from the number one sect had engaged in conversation with him, and as for the number one Great Family, the Yu Family\u2019s Yu ManTian had also exchanged blows with him a few times! Through his five underlings, Ling Tian had also discovered a lot of snippets of information obtained from Yu ManTian, but no one had ever mentioned this particular theory!</p><br/><p>But Li Xue so precisely hit the nail on the head! Was this a coincidence? Did such a coincidence even exist?</p><br/><p>He shook his head vigorously, clearing his thoughts. The eyes which Ling Tian used to observe Li Xue now had a few more points of uncertainty.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Li Xue anxiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I just recalled something. We have neglected one point.\u201d Ling Tian hid his suspicions in his heart, and laughed as he spoke, \u201cHave you realized anything from the final earth shattering commotion earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat have I realized? What can I realize? Justice\u2019s strength?\u201d Li Xue seemed to be at a loss as she blankly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Ling Tian laughed out as he swiftly thought of the proper words to say. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking in the wrong direction. I meant to say that we should be temporarily safe now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTemporarily safe? Oh, I get it!\u201d Li Xue suddenly exclaimed, \u201cThat\u2019s right, if Justice\u2019s opponents can cause such an impact to occur, that would mean that the fifteen of them are all true exponents, and with their combined strength, it would definitely not be below that of Justice himself. With their current hatred toward him, they wouldn\u2019t let him go so easily, and Justice, being the number one expert, can\u2019t just merely flee the scene. Thus this battle would be a desperate one, which would probably end up with both sides suffering losses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d A praising glint shone from Ling Tian\u2019s eyes. He had only come out this question as a last-minute topic, but Li Xue was actually able to infer so much in an instant, her intellect was definitely without question! \u201cMake a guess, Justice vs the fifteen of them. Who would win?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue immediately furrowed her brows and deeply pondered before saying, \u201cIt seems like the ultimate victor should still be Justice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Reason?\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s brows shot up.</p><br/><p>\u201cI had originally thought that if both of them ended up with losses, then they would definitely have their vital energy damaged. At that time, we could be fishermen and take the chance to sentence Justice to death! However, with Justice having fought with you for quite a while, although you might have escaped quite a few times, he is also not someone who is all brawn and no brains. The blow earlier was definitely caused only by purely internal energy comparison.\u201d Li Xue carefully analyzed. \u201cThus, if the fifteen of them work together, and only manage to force Justice into this state, then it must be said that Justice has full confidence in this battle. He believes that he will not be hurt and can even get an advantage!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, excellent! The opposing side has fifteen people after all. If anyone of them gets injured, then the advantage would definitely go to the side with more people. With Justice\u2019s capability, he would definitely be able to face off with them one on one, killing them off separately! Thus, if Justice dares to do such a move with all of them, it is a given that he has absolute confidence and certainty in himself!\u201d Ling Tian finished off with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, this is also what I have analyzed. However, there is a bottom line, that no matter how heaven-defying Justice is, he is definitely unable to leave uninjured! He might be the number one expert, but if he gets injured and wishes to continue pursuing me regardless, not only will his injuries not recover, but there\u2019s even the chance that our roles would change! Thus\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian concluded with finality, \u2018So long as Justice\u2019s wounds aren\u2019t fully healed, he won\u2019t appear in front of me. And for someone of Justice\u2019s level, he wouldn\u2019t easily get injured, hence once he receives an injury, it would be worse than normal! While he might be strong, for him to recover to the peak from an injury would require half a month to a full month! Within this time frame, we can plan out an elaborate scheme, targeting those people who wish to hit me while I\u2019m down, and not have to worry about a blade hovering over my neck during this period!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ha. Since that\u2019s the case, then what are you waiting for?\u201d Li Xue let out a mesmerizing laugh before her face turned cold and she seriously spoke, \u201cTian\u2019ge, what do you think of us getting rid of Justice while he\u2019s injured and recuperating? Would that not be settling the matter once and for all? Not leaving any blights behind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a bitter laugh at this suggestion, \u201cI would want that more than you actually, but do you think that\u2019s remotely possible? Let\u2019s not talk about first finding him. Even if we manage to do so, can we get rid of him without suffering any injuries whatsoever?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue could only let out a long sigh, and mirrored Ling Tian\u2019s bitter smile, \u201cOnly if we go for mutual destruction then can we probably kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. If we corner him, and he chooses to burn his life force, then he would enter his peak state for a short period of time. While this might resign him to death, once he does so, none of those who corner him will be left alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s expression was grave as he continued, \u201cFurthermore, we can\u2019t confirm right now to what degree he will be injured upon ending the fight with the fifteen of them. Better to be cautious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that we have to wait till he comes after you? Then we\u2019ll be stuck at a spot again! Your cultivation can\u2019t possibly surpass him in the short run! This matter is a huge headache!\u201d Li Xue furrowed her brows in frustration.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, regarding this point, you can relax. I\u2019ve made a bet with Justice, that if he can\u2019t kill me within half a year, then he would give up on his pursuit triggered by the Martial Order Medallion. Furthermore, he will owe me three favors!\u201d Ling Tian winked before laughing suggestively.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

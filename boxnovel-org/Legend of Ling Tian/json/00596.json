After waiting bitterly for six hours, he couldn\u2019t find a chance to strike. After that, Lei ZhenTian\u2019s son was killed and Lei ZhenTian charged forward without a care in the world.</p><br/><p>The target had suddenly disappeared and Ling Chi almost lost his breath from frustration.</p><br/><p>Following that, three deacons surrounded Ling Chen in an attempt to block her. Right when Ling Chen was in danger and Ling Chi was about to take action, another black-robed figure shot down from the sky and saved her.</p><br/><p>Ling Chi heaved a sigh of relief. While he didn\u2019t know whether or not the black-robed figure had good or bad intentions, Ling Chi could already recognize the black-robed figure from his aura. As long as Ling Chen was saved by him, she would definitely be safe. The thing that made Ling Chi overjoyed was the fact that those three Lei Family deacons seemed to have gone crazy and become dazed while staring at the back of the black-robed figure! To an accomplished assassin like Ling Chi, this was like a gold ingot falling from the sky!</p><br/><p>Ling Chi immediately took action. With his martial arts, even if he wasn\u2019t injured and in his peak form, he would only be able to kill one out of the three at the very most and might even suffer from a counterattack. Not to mention the fact that he was currently heavily injured. Thus, Ling Chi had already prepared himself to perish together with the enemy.</p><br/><p>However, a series of coincidences collided with each other and Ling Chi was able to kill two Lei Family deacons despite his heavy injuries! Furthermore, they were the two deacons who were uninjured. As for the last deacon, his right arm was already cleaved off by Ling Chen and the way Ling Chi saw it, the injured deacon was no longer fit to be his target. He would naturally choose to target the two deacons with the highest combat strength.</p><br/><p>When he saw the First Deacon\u2019s body squirming, Ling Chi knew that if he pulled out his sword, it would be impossible for him to kill the First Deacon. While this sword was enough to heavily injure the First Deacon, it wasn\u2019t enough to kill. Thus, Ling Chi risked taking a palm strike just so he could cleave the First Deacon right through the chest!</p><br/><p>Now his mission was accomplished, and even though he suffered from a heavy palm strike on the chest and his innards were all shifted, causing him to lose all of his combat ability, Ling Chi was still extremely happy! It was worth it!</p><br/><p>The Second Deacon was stabbed from the back by Ling Chi and died on the spot. The First Deacon was cleaved into two halves and it was naturally impossible for him to remain alive. Who would have thought that these two individuals who were mighty figures in the continent would have died such depressing deaths? They died in the hands of such a young hero and were even skewered like a shish kebab! The most depressing thing was the fact that this assassin was heavily injured but was actually able to kill the two of them alone!</p><br/><p>Dying such a depressing death, these two individuals must have definitely died with regret.</p><br/><p>Ling Chi weakly lay on the ground with blood oozing out of his nose and mouth. He did not even have the strength to lift a single finger but he was still laughing heartily while coughing incessantly. Looking at the corpses of the two powerhouses beside him, he was filled with immense satisfaction!</p><br/><p>While this assassination attempt happened under such circumstances, this was the assassination that Ling Chi was most satisfied with! It was no wonder that despite being unable to move a single finger, he was still laughing so happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAHHH!!!\u201d the Third Deacon roared in devastation. He never imagined and could not believe that the brothers who he had spent the last seventy years with would have been so cruelly killed before his very eyes! Looking the assassin in the eyes, he was filled with immense hatred. He could no longer be bothered about the arm that he had just lost and the blood spraying out from his wound as he walked towards Ling Chi step by step. He clenched his teeth and hatefully said, \u201cLittle b*st*rd! You dared to kill my two older brothers?! This old man will tear you up into a thousand pieces! If I miss even a single piece, this old man wouldn\u2019t be able to swallow this enmity! Little b*st*rd, I will let you know what it means to lead a life worse than death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chi weakly looked at the Third Deacon and laughed, \u201cOld fool, a thousand pieces? If you slice me up into a piece less, you would have been brought up by a prostitute!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will be satisfied!\u201d The Third Deacon smiled as he walked towards Ling Chi.</p><br/><p>Ling Chi looked at him without a single trace of fear in his eyes and scolded viciously, \u201cOld b*st*rd, were all of your ancestors prostitutes? How did they bring up a thing like you? Just looking at you fills me with disgust!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Third Deacon was angered to the point that he began trembling. Just when he was about to let out a curse, his face suddenly turned strange and a shiny sword penetrated out from his chest. The Third Deacon began to choke breathlessly with rage in his eyes and he pointed to Ling Chi with resentment. He wanted to turn around to see who killed him, but he was only able to turn halfway before collapsing lifelessly on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cDog egg, dog egg\u2026 are you alright?\u201d Two individuals charged forward with blood all over them and they were Ling Six and Seven.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k! Don\u2019t call me dog egg! How many times have I said this? Why can\u2019t the two of you b*st*rds remember that?!\u201d Ling Chi scolded in anger.</p><br/><p>Ling Six and Seven smiled happily. Ling Chi saw that the two of them had gotten rid of their enemies and were charging over towards him. Thus, he tried to provoke the Third Deacon so that he could attract the Third Deacon\u2019s attention. Both Ling Six and Seven then succeeded in a single strike.</p><br/><p>In truth, even if Ling Chi didn\u2019t provoke the Third Deacon, he was completely focused on Ling Chi. It was also because of this that Ling Six did not even face any retaliation.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Chi did not even have the strength to turn his neck and asked softly, \u201cI am going to fall asleep\u2026 tell me what is happening\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Seven quickly took out a bottle of medicine and applied it on Ling Chi\u2019s body. Ling Six then comforted, \u201cSister Chen and both the Yu and Shui ladies are out of danger already. The Lei Family has temporarily stopped their attack and the two of us ran over before hearing who that black-robed man was. Hehe, we truly came at the right time. If we came a second later, dog egg would have been sliced up until egg yolk spilled out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit\u2026 nothing good can come out from your mouth\u2026\u201d Hearing that there was no longer danger, Ling Chi heaved a sigh of relief and fell unconscious\u2026</p><br/><p>The black-robed man who appeared suddenly stood up straight and faced the encirclement of the countless Lei Family experts without a single trace of fear. The Lei Family warriors were all pressured by his immense aura and not a single person dared to move!</p><br/><p>Beneath the feet of the black-robed individual, there were two bodies that did not even seem like two human figures. They were covered with injuries all over and a puddle of blood had formed underneath their bodies. Ling Chen forced her eyes opened and gasped, \u201cLing Feng, Ling Yun!\u201d She then struggled to get up.</p><br/><p>The two individuals on the ground were Ling Feng and Ling Yun. There wasn\u2019t a single bit of complete skin on their bodies, but from the slight raising and falling of their chests it was obvious that they were still alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t die. It\u2019s best for you to worry about yourself,\u201d the black-robed man coldly said as he put Ling Chen down.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen tried to steady herself before turning around to take a look. She was startled but yet relieved and said with gratitude, \u201cThank you senior for saving me.\u201d At the same time, she knew that as long as this person was here, the Ling Family Courtyard wouldn\u2019t be in danger any longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need, it was just out of convenience.\u201d The black-robed man snorted coldly with dissatisfaction in his heart as he thought, Every time this daddy tries to finds trouble with that brat Ling Tian, he always ends up taking advantage of me. After chasing that brat for half a year, his martial arts realm had actually increased rapidly. Now that I am here to ask him something, I have to save his lover and brothers and even help him guard his base! Did this daddy owe him something in my past life?</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian\u2019s eyes finally shifted away from his son\u2019s corpse and were locked firmly onto the black-robed man. A chilly glow could be seen in his eyes as he asked slowly, \u201cMartial Order Medallion owner, Justice?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-robed man looked at Lei ZhenTian calmly and replied, \u201cI never thought that the Lei Family would know my name.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Justice\u2019s words left his mouth, the members of the Lei and Ling Families were completely astounded. At the same time, silence filled the entire Courtyard and those who wanted to take action did not dare to make a move.</p><br/><p>Martial Order Medallion owner, Justice! He was the number one expert in the world! Just this title alone was enough to shock all of them present. This baleful star was not an individual who knew what mercy was and was invincible. If they were to provoke him, how many lives would they have to use to escape from Justice\u2019s pursuit?</p><br/><p>The battle between both parties had become strangely peaceful because of Justice\u2019s appearance!</p><br/><p>This black-robed man was the number one expert in the world, Justice!</p><br/><p>During this period of time, Justice\u2019s mental state was stimulated by Ling Tian and he felt that he was on the verge of a breakthrough. Just when he was feeling excited and about to enter into seclusion to make a breakthrough, rumors began flying across the continent that he was killed by Ling Tian. All of the rumors seemed so realistic as though it was the truth.</p><br/><p>Justice could not help but be depressed and after some investigations, he found out that the rumors came from Sky Bearing. It was said that young noble Ling Tian said it when he was drunk, saying that he killed Justice like he was killing a chicken\u2026</p><br/><p>Justice was enraged, thoroughly enraged!</p><br/><p>This little brat actually dared to slander him! This was unforgivable! Just when he was wondering if he should find trouble with Ling Tian, he received news from his sect that they were seeking Ling Tian to take revenge\u2026</p><br/><p>As a result, Justice became truly anxious. He was deeply aware of Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts and also the fact that Ling Tian was surrounded by experts. Apart from Ye QingChen who had some relationship with Ling Tian, if anyone else were to face Ling Tian alone, their deaths would be certain!</p><br/><p>As such, Justice rushed to Sky Bearing without any delay and because he was in the depths of the mountains, it took him quite a bit of time. This journey of his was truly both arduous and hasty.</p><br/><p>After rushing for a long period of time, he finally arrived to witness the calamity of the Ling Family Courtyard! However, he was depressed to the point that he almost fainted\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

He then took out a silver ingot and threw it at the gambler who was kicked by him. Following which, he raised his head and walked out slowly. With a snort, he asked calmly, \u201cWho are you guys? You guys actually dare to be so domineering in the city; do you still have the law in your eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian said that, everyone wanted to faint.</p><br/><p>This brat previously ignored the law and attacked someone for no reason, beating a few of his teeth out. If not for these people who arrived, that gambler would probably be dead in his hands already. Now he was actually acting justified and asking if they had the law in their eyes!</p><br/><p>The men dressed in black had a face full of anxiousness. But he did not dare to offend Ling Tian. Although he really wanted to just slap that brat to the site, Ling Tian\u2019s background did not allow him to do that. Thus, he cupped his hands and said, \u201cReporting to young master Ling, we are the subordinates of the Blood Rose Hall. We have received orders to leave the city to handle some matters. We did not know that young master is here and had ruined your fun. This subordinate here apologizes for that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then made a soft \u201coh\u201d and pretended that he was interested, \u201cWhat are you guys going to do? Tell this young master.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man dressed in black almost went crazy, thinking to himself, This little brat! Helpless, he could only reveal a face of difficulty, \u201cI hope that young master will understand. This matter involves the secret of the Blood Rose Hall and this subordinate cannot spread it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then chuckled and said, \u201cWhat you mean is that you cannot tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sweat began to trickle down the forehead of the man dressed in black as he replied, \u201cIt is not that I cannot. It is just that this subordinate\u2019s status is just too low. How about\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then laughed as his face lit up and said magnanimously, \u201cSince it isn\u2019t convenient for you guys to say it, forget it then. This young master isn\u2019t too curious anyway. Alright, go and do your stuff, this young master will not delay you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man dressed in black cursed in his heart, Dammit, this still isn\u2019t called curious! This is called not delaying us! Now that you stopped us, who knows where that son of a bitch is now! However, he did not dare display any of those as he replied, \u201cThank you young master, we will take our leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a wave of his right hand, the men in black weaved through the crowd and continued to give chase.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could not help but be taken aback. After he slowed them down on purpose, everyone who had a little bit of experience would know that it was almost impossible for them to catch the boy back again! But these men in black actually did not give up and continued to give chase! But the boy whom they were chasing after was obviously just a seven to eight-year-old child!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then scratched his chin and thought to himself, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me there is something strange going on?\u201d Ling Tian was curious.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Ling Tian could not help but scold himself for being an idiot! Currently, it was snowing so heavily. It wouldn\u2019t matter if the boy did not exit the city. But the moment he leaves the city, the footprints would be enough to find him!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was extremely interested in the boy who ran away for a single reason: the resolute look on his face as he grit his teeth. Also, it was because of the great control he displayed when he was escaping. That desperate escape reminded Ling Tian about the hopelessness in his previous life.</p><br/><p>After standing there for a moment, Ling Tian decided that he would go and take a look. He then looked towards the two servants following him and said, \u201cBoth of you return first. If old master asks, just say that I will be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two servants were shocked and said, \u201cYoung master, we will not dare to do so. Please take us along with you if you have anything to do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he said, \u201cSince I asked the both of you to go back, you two should go back. Why? You aren\u2019t going to listen to me now?\u201d The chill in his voice was full of threat.</p><br/><p>The both of them fell into a dilemma! If they don\u2019t listen to Ling Tian, he would definitely get angry. Ling Tian was someone who dared to even beat Ling Zhen; if they didn\u2019t listen to him, they would definitely end up in a plight worse than Ling Zhen. But if the both of them were to return on their own and something happens to Ling Tian, a hundred lives of theirs won\u2019t be enough to repay their mistakes!</p><br/><p>The both of them looked at each other and were determined, \u201cYoung master, we are willing to accept your punishment. But we will definitely not go back without you. Please forgive us, young master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was speechless. Looking at his own five-year-old body, he understood that it was impossible to let them return on their own. Helpless, he could only say, \u201cAlright, follow me if you are willing. But let me make matters clear first. If you cannot keep up with me, then find a spot near the gate of the mansion to wait for me to come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The both of them agreed immediately.</p><br/><p>A short while later, both the servants were panting heavily with their hand on their knees and face completely flushed red. As for Ling Tian, he was already out of their sights. Looking at the bustling crowd in front of them, they could not help but be at a loss. As one of them finally regained his breath, he said with amazement, \u201cI say, second brother, this young master of ours is a real weirdo.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other servant wiped off his sweat and said, \u201cIndeed. I have never seen a five-year-old child run even faster than a rabbit. It can\u2019t be helped, young master went in the direction of the city gates. Let us wait for him there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian weaved through the crowds as though he was taking a stroll. With his small size, he was able to weave through them easily without them even knowing.</p><br/><p>In the front, the figures of those burly men dressed in black could be seen. They were at the city gates waiting to exit. It seems that the boy had indeed left the city, Ling Tian thought.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was rather disappointed; with such a weather, it was akin to seeking death if he were to leave the city! With his intelligence, Ling Tian felt that he was blowing matters up.</p><br/><p>Is this little brat worth my effort?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shook his head, Since I have already started, let me complete it. With Ling Tian\u2019s character, he would not allow himself to give up halfway. Thinking about this, Ling Tian walked towards the city gates.</p><br/><p>Looking at Ling Tian\u2019s luxurious clothes and arrogant aura, the guards of the city gates did not dare to stop him and let him out immediately.</p><br/><p>As he left the city, he saw a sea of white in front of him.</p><br/><p>A few black dots then dashed towards a single direction. They were the men dressed in black. In that direction, it seemed as though there was smoke rising from afar and a forest ahead.</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian looked to the horizon, he asked himself, \u201cIf I was being chased, would I choose that direction to run in?\u201d The answer was: Of course not.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian carefully observed the cluster of footsteps at the exit of the city gates and realized that there were roughly the same number of people going in all directions without the obvious footprint of a child.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian thought for a moment and walked ahead. Then, with the position he was in as an axis, he turned around to take a look at his surroundings. After walking up to here, the footprints from the city gates were already scattered much clearer than before. As Ling Tian took a closer look, he could not find any small footprints.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed in his heart. This fellow is really interesting!</p>\n</div>"}

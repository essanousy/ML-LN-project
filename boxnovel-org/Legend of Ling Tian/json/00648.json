While Yu BingYan\u2019s condition had taken a turn for the better and she had even cultivated some inner qi, she was still a distance away from Shui QianRou from the Shui Family. There wasn\u2019t a need for Yu ManLou to resort to any underhanded means and Yu BingYan would definitely perish in the upcoming battle!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong looked at Yu BingYan with an investigative look before praising, \u201cThis niece is indeed a gentle and tender individual. I heard that you suffered from a huge sickness since you were young. Looking at you today, you should have recovered from your illness completely. What a blessed event.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan\u2019s face reddened and she replied respectfully, \u201cBingYan was lucky and Senior Justice from Beyond Heavens cured me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong burst out with a hearty laugh and said, \u201cI see! It seems like you are truly a fortunate individual.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan bowed slightly and replied, \u201cUncle is too kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>After which, Shui ManKong stopped his conversation with Yu BingYan. He could already tell that while this lady in front of him wasn\u2019t weak, she definitely wasn\u2019t a match for his daughter. If that\u2019s the case, regardless of whether or not her illness was genuine or feigned, the only important thing would be for his daughter to emerge victorious and keep her life.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan\u2019s words immediately drew the attention of Ye QingChen and the others from Beyond Heavens. They knew that Yu BingYan\u2019s Divine Black Negative Meridians was an incurable illness, and even if Justice was able to cure her it was impossible to transform her into a martial arts expert within such a short period of time! However, Yu BingYan was obviously cured and she had even pushed all the responsibility to Justice. How could the four of them not be filled with doubts at the moment?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? I heard that little princess\u2019 illness was the extremely rare Divine Black Negative Meridians and you have the pure Yin element body. The Divine Black Negative Meridians should be an incurable illness. Could it be that Justice truly has the capability to reverse Yin and Yang and go against the heavens? I am truly in disbelief.\u201d An eccentric voice sounded from the number three figure in the Shui Family, Shui ManCheng.</p><br/><p>His son died a miserable death and he was filled with extreme grief. He originally wished for Shui QianHuan and Shui QianRou to die in the generational battle for his anger to be quelled. However, he never expected that Shui QianHuan would be saved by Justice and Shui QianRou\u2019s opponent was obviously weaker than her. This meant that both of Shui ManKong\u2019s children would definitely survive the battle. This was something unacceptable to Shui ManCheng!</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng\u2019s heart was filled with darkness. If he lost his descendants, Shui ManKong must also lose all of his descendants! Why should his son be the only one to perish while the children to others could be allowed to be alive and kicking?!</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng\u2019s words immediately incited fury from both families. Shui ManKong was reminded of how his own son was killed by Shui QianHuan and hearing that Shui ManCheng actually wanted the death of his daughter, he was consumed with rage and had the urge to strangle Shui ManCheng to death at the next instant!</p><br/><p>Before Shui ManKong could say a thing, Yu ManTian had already jumped out of his seat. Yu ManTian\u2019s opponent this time was Shui ManCheng and he looked at Shui ManCheng with disdain, \u201cShui ManCheng, what kind of thing can you be considered to be? Do you have the rights to say anything here? How is it any of your business that my niece\u2019s illness was cured? Darn b*st*rd, is your skin being itchy and seeking a beating? Come come come, let this Third Master fulfill your wishes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Yu ManTian opened his mouth, expletives flew out without restraint and Shui ManCheng was angered to the point his face flushed red, \u201cYu ManTian! You actually have the cheek to call yourself the Third Master of the Yu Family with that upbringing of yours? You darn b*st*rd! You are no different from a hooligan on the streets! Who is the darn a**hole who didn\u2019t know how to pull his pants up and had you as a child? What has my question has got to do with a b*st*rd like you? For your Yu Family to be a sore loser and be as despicable to find someone to pose as Yu BingYan, you still don\u2019t dare to let me ask a few simple questions? Are you feeling guilty from your misdeeds?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian raised his legs and the table in front of him flew towards Shui ManCheng. His muscles all flexed up and the chest area of his shirt ripped open, revealing his thick black chest hair. Charging forward at Shui ManCheng, he roared, \u201cF**k you sixth uncle Shui ManCheng, you dare to curse this Third Master? Your Shui Family are the b*st*rds who are the sore losers! A**holes with the guilty conscience! I f**k your &amp;#($*#@\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the endless profanities were being spewed out, the two of them looked as though they were about to break out in a fight. Their eyes were completely red as they stared at each other as though there was a sea of enmity between them. Anyone who saw their current appearances would not believe that this was the first time that they had seen each other and would definitely think that there was a life or death enmity between them\u2026</p><br/><p>The Shui Family\u2019s banquet had already turned into a shouting contest between them! These two third masters were both filled with profanities and were even more rascally than the hooligans in the street!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian had been holding in his anger for a full month already. Ever since Yu ManLou insisted on sending Yu BingYan to her death, Yu ManTian was angered to the point that he was about to explode. He was the matchmaker for the marriage between the Yu and Ling Families and he was extremely fond of both Yu BingYan and Ling Tian. With Yu ManLou\u2019s decision, Yu ManTian felt as though he did not have the face to see the world any longer!</p><br/><p>These last few days, he would always glare at Yu ManLou provocatively whenever he saw Yu ManLou. Yu ManLou naturally wouldn\u2019t go down to his level and thus he had a belly full of unvented anger. The innocent victims of his anger would naturally be the warriors of the Yu Family who came with him to Heavenly Wind. Anyone who saw him would not have a good time and all of the Yu Family warriors avoided him as though he was the plague.</p><br/><p>Even the First Elder of the Yu Family, Yu ChongXiao, who exited his seclusion for this trip was also given a good scolding by Yu ManTian. At the very end of the journey, even Yu BingYan\u2019s father, Yu ManTang could not escape from Yu ManTian and was being cursed for selling his daughter for glory.</p><br/><p>Now that Shui ManCheng began doubting Yu BingYan\u2019s identity and even cursed the Yu Family for being sore losers, Yu ManTian was like a pack of firecrackers that had been ignited. He finally had the chance to vent his anger and thus the result was this shouting contest\u2026</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng\u2019s only son had just passed away and he was already in grief. He would vent his anger on whoever he saw. Now that he met Yu ManTian, it was like dry wood meeting with fire. He was instantly ignited and charged at Yu ManTian without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>Seeing the two Third Masters about to break out into a fight before the generational battle even began, everyone present was dumbfounded. The moment these two lunatics broke out into a fight, it would probably be impossible to break the fight up without one of them falling.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou and Shui ManKong shouted at the two of them to stop at the same time but they both refused to listen. Shui ManCheng did not place Shui ManKong in his sights at all and thus ignored his words completely. As for Yu ManTian, he already had a belly full of anger towards his big brother. Now that he had the opportunity to vent his anger, not to mention Yu ManLou, even if a celestial being descended from the skies, he would still fight to his heart\u2019s content first!</p><br/><p>\u201cStop them!\u201d Shui ManKong and Yu ManLou ordered at the same time.</p><br/><p>The experts of the Yu and Shui Families rushed forward and tackled the two third masters onto the ground when they were just an arm\u2019s length away from each other. Their faces were already so near each other but they were unable to fight to their heart\u2019s content!</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng glared at Yu ManTian and spat a mouthful of spittle in his face. Yu ManTian flew into a rage and spat a mouthful of spittle in return. Very quickly, their shouting contest became a fight of spitting at each other. However, things did not end there. Yu ManTian was still dissatisfied and circulating his inner qi, he forced himself to vomit out everything that he had eaten in Shui ManCheng\u2019s face. A stench immediately filled the entire room and the brows of everyone present twitched.</p><br/><p>The experts from both the families immediately covered their noses with one of their hand while using the other arm to drag these two third masters apart from each other as though they were two dead pigs. Ten long white marks made from their nails scratching the ground could be seen as the two third masters were dragged away unwillingly.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou and Shui ManKong were angered to the point their veins were bulging.</p><br/><p>The moment the two third masters were dragged back, they immediately became active again. The moment Shui ManCheng jumped up from the ground, he smelled the stench all over his face and could not help but puke out his meal as well\u2026 Yu ManTian wiped off the spittle on his face and began cursing like no tomorrow again\u2026</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s figure disappeared and with a loud slapping sound, he gave Yu ManTian a tight slap and berated, \u201cShut your trap!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian glared at Yu ManLou and roared back, \u201cThis daddy isn\u2019t convinced, come and bite me if you want!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was completely enraged.</p><br/><p>After the mess created by these two individuals, the close to a thousand people in the hall lost all of their appetites. They all had odd expressions on their faces and had the urge to puke out whatever they had eaten\u2026</p><br/><p>While these two third masters did not end up fighting, the chaos created would definitely go down in the history books. The whole hall was extremely silent as everyone in the hall looked at each other speechlessly.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a ripping sound could be heard and all of them turned to take a look. After venting all of his anger and vomiting out what he had eaten, Yu ManTian felt his stomach growl and thus ripped off a chicken leg and enjoyed the delicacy. Seeing everyone look at him, Third Master Yu lifted up his wine flask and drank it all in a single breath.</p><br/><p>On the other side, the Third Master of the Shui Family had already vomited to the point he was devoid of energy\u2026 While they were both Third Masters, the difference between these two Third Masters was stark!</p><br/><p>As everyone looked at Yu ManTian enjoying his chicken leg and thought about his face full of spittle, they were all dumbfounded. They felt as though there were worms crawling in their throat\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, a few of them could not take it any longer and turned around to puke. After the first person began puking, it was as though a chain reaction was set off and many others followed\u2026</p><br/><p>Only the two Family Heads, Shui WuBo and Yu ManTang were able to keep their cool!</p><br/><p>The banquet of the Shui Family had ended in such a manner with everyone puking like no tomorrow. All of those who participated in the banquet seemed to have gone through a large battle as they walked weakly out of the hall.</p><br/><p>When the banquet was announced to have ended, Third Master Yu had still shouted out, \u201cI haven\u2019t had enough!\u201d He then stood up and began grabbing the various delicacies in front of him and eating it without any concern for table manners.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou shook his head with a sigh and Yu ManTang was completely embarrassed. Yu BingYan covered her mouth as she giggled and all the other Yu Family warriors opened up their gap with Yu ManTian and used their action to show that \u2018they did not know\u2019 who Yu ManTian was. As for the warriors of the Shui Family, they all looked at Yu ManTian with disdain in their eyes.</p><br/><p>This fellow truly threw all of our face away today. Yu ManLou hatefully glared at his third brother and had the urge to give Yu ManTian a good beating. Just when he was about to announce his farewell, a mellow crash sounded from afar.</p><br/><p>Everyone was taken aback and their footsteps halted. Following that, an overbearing aura could be felt in the entire hall. This overbearing aura was powerful to the point it covered all of Mount Vacant! At this moment, everyone felt as though the whole heavens were crashing down on them! They did not even have the ability to think about resisting this might!</p><br/><p>If there was a deity in the world, this aura being given out must definitely belong to a deity! Such an aura had probably exceeded the realm of the martial way! This was a realm that had already exceeded all of their understanding!</p><br/><p>All of their faces immediately turned pale without exception!</p><br/><p>Just who could have such a frightening aura?! If this individual attacked them in the hall right now, wouldn\u2019t all of them be like lambs to the slaughter?</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou fixed his gaze on Shui ManKong as he tried to deduce if this peerless expert was someone from the Shui Family! After all, they were in Heavenly Wind and in the territory of the Shui Family. For a heaven-defying character to appear at this moment, how could Yu ManLou not feel his heart burn with anxiousness?</p><br/><p>With just a single glance, Yu ManLou was certain that this individual did not belong to the Shui Family. At this moment, all of the Shui Family members were also filled with absolute shock! This included both Shui WuBo and Shui ManKong! If that\u2019s the case, Yu ManLou could be slightly at ease. Regardless of how high this expert\u2019s martial arts were, as long as he was like Justice and did not belong to any factions, roaming the world as he wished, he would not affect Yu ManLou\u2019s master plan! It was very likely that this individual who made a sudden appearance was such an individual. After all, they had not heard about such a character before today!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong and the others were also filled with unease at this moment. Just what was the meaning of such a powerful aura appearing at this moment? Could he be from the Yu Family? If not, why would this aura only appear the moment the members of the Yu Family arrived?</p><br/><p>As such, just when Yu ManLou was studying Shui ManKong, Shui ManKong was also studying Yu ManLou\u2019s expression. Upon witnessing the reaction of the other party, Shui ManKong also felt at ease. Since Yu ManLou\u2019s first reaction was to look at him, it proved that this individual did not belong to the Yu Family! Since he did not belong to the Yu Family, he just had to ensure that they respected him from afar. Such an individual would probably not interfere with the conflicts in the pugilistic world and it was very likely that he belonged to Heavenly Wind. As long as his family treated this expert with gifts and politeness, perhaps they could\u2026</p><br/><p>As the two Family Heads looked at each other, they both let out a dry chuckle at the same time. However, they did not understand what they were laughing about. Was it a laugh of ease or one of self-mockery? Their myriad feelings within the laughter were ones that even they did not understand.</p><br/><p>After exchanging a few pleasantries, both families went their own way and went back to rest. There wasn\u2019t a need for them to think about anything else at the moment except for the final battle three days from now.</p><br/><p>While the banquet was ruined, it was still considered a banquet!</p><br/><p>The day after tomorrow would be the day that separated life from death for many of them!</p><br/><p>However, it was far too early for Yu ManLou to be at ease. He never imagined that the source of this frightening aura did not belong to the Shui Family or anyone from the Heavenly Wind Continent. If given a choice, Yu ManLou would probably wish that he belonged to someone from the Shui Family!</p><br/><p>That was because this expert was actually Ling Tian! Yu ManLou\u2019s biggest opponent in his life! Could it be that Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts had truly reached the peak of perfection? If not, why would he be able to release a deity like pressure?</p><br/><p>On the east peak of Mount Vacant and in the cave.</p><br/><p>On the ground, a gigantic ball similar to a silk cocoon gradually expanded and bloated up as though it was a deflated ball being pumped up with air. After a series of bloating up and then flattening down, the silk ball began expanding at a visible rate\u2026 A crackling sound was then heard, and with a mellow bang the silk ball exploded into a ball of mist, revealing a naked human body within. The skin of this human body was completely fair and glowing. Even the most beautiful lady in the world would not have such beautiful skin.</p><br/><p>This person was naturally Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>The aura that Yu ManLou and the others felt was the explosive force during the explosion of the silk ball. After remodeling Ling Tian\u2019s body, the remaining ten-thousand-year-old spiritual milk was dispersed through the force of the explosion. How could the mere strength of humans be compared to the accumulation of ten thousand years in nature? It was no wonder that everyone would be filled with shock and fear.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was naturally unaware that he had unknowingly shocked the experts of both the Heavenly Wind and Heavenly Star Continents! If he knew about it, he would have definitely burst out into laughter.</p></div>\n</div>"}

Then, four of them jumped onto their horses and charged into battle. The original eight blue-robed elders remained on the spot without a single change in their expressions. Their job was to ensure Shui QianHuan\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>Wei ChengPing\u2019s face began to cramp up as a frustrated look could be seen in his eyes. However, it flashed past briefly, and he didn\u2019t say a thing! Currently, they were completely surrounded by friendly forces but Shui QianHuan still prepared such defenses. If that\u2019s the case, wasn\u2019t what Shui QianHuan was guarding against obvious?</p><br/><p>\u201cShui QianHuan finally sent out their experts! I believe the battle will be ending shortly! Ling Xiao is finished.\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s voice could be heard, \u201cIt is time for us to leave, there isn\u2019t any meaning for us to continue spectating this battle. We need to go back and preparations! Western Han, Northern Wei\u2026 ah ah ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang let out a sigh and looked towards the valiant Ling Xiao with regret.</p><br/><p>However, a plan will never be able to keep up with the changes in times! Today, these words were confirmed again!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the sound of rushing winds could be heard from afar!</p><br/><p>The rushing winds were barely audible but gradually grew louder and louder! Then, a large dragon seemed to have appeared in the sky! Following which, a loud roar shook the heavens, drowning out the battlecries of the 400,000 soldiers present!</p><br/><p>Nothing else could be heard apart from this loud roar!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou who was about to leave turned his head around with shock on his face, Ling Tian! Ling Tian is here! To think that his cultivation progressed so quickly! Did I make a miscalculation? Would Ling Tian have the strength to turn this situation around? Yu ManLou grew worried as he thought about it. Finally, he gave a command, \u201cMen! Inform Han TieXuan to kill Ling Xiao at all costs before Ling Tian arrives!\u201d In the dense vegetation, a black shadow suddenly darted towards the Western Han army!</p><br/><p>Han TieXuan! Why would the general of Western Han listen to the orders of the Yu Family Head? Did he belong to the Yu Family?</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother!\u201d Yu ManTang was astounded as he cried out. However, Yu ManLou\u2019s expression was chilly with the corner of his lips curling up in a cruel fashion, ignoring Yu ManTang\u2019s words completely.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang let out a long sigh and couldn\u2019t help but look towards the source of the roar. Ling Tian, can you really save your father, despite the fact that both the largest families in the world want your father dead?</p><br/><p>In the past few weeks, every single piece of news the Yu Family received had something to do with Ling Tian. However, regardless of whether it was the wary Yu ManLou or the curious Yu ManTang, they were seeing Ling Tian for the first time!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang was especially agitated at this moment. While he had never met Ling Tian before, his own daughter was deeply in love with Ling Tian and Ling Tian would become his future son-in-law! I wonder what this brat looks like? With just this roar alone, only a few people in this world would be a match for him! Not to mention myself, even my third brother who is at the XianTian realm doesn\u2019t have such profound cultivation. Perhaps only big brother would have such a profound cultivation!</p><br/><p>While he had not seen Ling Tian in person yet, just this heaven-shaking roar made Yu ManTang feel a sense of satisfaction in his heart.</p><br/><p>Ling Nineteen and the other three were originally exhausted of all their strength and were only holding on with their tenacious willpower. In truth, the four of them were already feeling feeble in their arms with their vision starting to grow dark. Be it willpower or inner qi, they were already reaching their limits! If they relaxed by just a little bit, they would definitely collapse on the ground immediately!</p><br/><p>However, that resounding roar had immediately filled them with energy! Their blades were suddenly brandished with energy as the enemies surrounding were slaughtered mercilessly. Ling Nineteen felt himself choking up as he said emotionally, \u201cIt\u2019s young noble\u2019s voice! Young noble is here!\u201d Even his tone was filled with incredulity!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Ling Nineteen let out a roar and began slicing up the Northern Wei soldiers like fruit. Then, he jumped up on his horse and shouted with all his might, \u201cYoung noble Ling Tian is here! Young noble Ling Tian is here!\u201d His voice was filled with ecstasy!</p><br/><p>As the troops who were here to save Ling Xiao heard that, they were immediately brimming with energy again. A wave of cheers sounded, \u201cYoung noble is here! Young noble is here personally!\u201d Everyone was filled with fighting spirit as they forcefully fought their way a hundred feet nearer to Ling Xiao! Their troops were only a mere 50 feet away from each other! However, there were still countless Northern Wei soldiers separating the two troops!</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan was startled! The inner qi of the person who let out this roar had already reached unfathomable depths! Who was he? Who was here to save Ling Xiao? With this person around, the chances of Ling Xiao surviving would be greatly increased. He was stationed far away from Ling Nineteen and couldn\u2019t hear the cheers on the battlefield. However, he could feel a sense of danger in his heart!</p><br/><p>\u201cKill Ling Xiao at all costs! Don\u2019t hold anything back!\u201d Shui QianHuan shouted out!</p><br/><p>The flags that were erected upright were fluttering in the winds.</p><br/><p>As dusk approached, the sky was already painted red with the blood-like clouds looming over their heads bringing about a gloomy atmosphere. Even the winds sounded like they were mourning\u2026</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan\u2019s voice spread out far and the four Shui Family experts sped up even further. Barely a trace of their figure could be spotted as they weaved through the many soldiers, rapidly approaching Ling Xiao!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Han TieXuan from Western Han also gave a cruel order, \u201cPut your lives at stake to kill the enemies! Kill Ling Xiao! Anyone who dares to take a step back will have their families executed!\u201d After this order was given, the Western Han soldiers began to charge maniacally! The Ling army suddenly felt the pressure increase by many folds in an instant! The whole battlefield had broken out into chaos!</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that the four Shui Family fellows will be able to take out Ling Xiao before Ling Tian arrives! If not\u2026\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s face was solemn as he stared at the battle without blinking. From Ling Tian\u2019s roar, Yu ManLou could already tell that Ling Tian\u2019s inner qi was no weaker than his own! If such an expert were to join the battle, while it was impossible for him to turn the tides of the battle, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for him to protect a single person!</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Yu ManLou couldn\u2019t help but let out a sigh, I should have killed Ling Xiao personally just now! The opportunity is already gone. If I were to go down now, I would definitely have to face Ling Tian in battle. This was something that Yu ManLou was not willing to do!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian\u2019s enmity with the Shui Family had already been established. Even if Ling Tian could take a step back, the Shui Family would never allow such a powerful existence to become their enemy! As Yu ManLou thought this, his eyes were as calm as the still lake.</p><br/><p>From afar, the crisp sound of galloping horses could be heard and five horses appeared in everyone\u2019s sight! Originally, it was only a single black dot. However, they could quickly witness the appearances of the five individuals! Five white-robed young men, with one holding onto a guandao, nearing the battlefield like a death god! Despite facing more than 100,000 troops with only the strength of five individuals, they still dashed over without any consideration or hesitation!</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian saw the sea of soldiers, he was worried for his father\u2019s safety and began to shout, \u201cLing Nineteen!\u201d His voice sounded like thunder on a sunny day! The Northern Wei soldiers near him felt their heads go dizzy with some of them fainting on the spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am here\u2026 the Marshal is safe\u2026 come quick! Come\u2026 quick!!\u201d In the sea of soldiers, an ear-piercing voice could be heard.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was immediately energized as he quickly spotted the origin of Ling Nineteen\u2019s voice. Knowing that his father was safe, he felt a sense of relief. However, from the direction where Ling Nineteen\u2019s voice sounded, they were at least a mile apart. If the soldiers were to line up in a single row, there would probably be 2000 soldiers in a mile. How would it be an easy affair to penetrate through such defenses?</p><br/><p>In the battlefield, anything can happen in an instant, and a single blade can determine life and death! Now, the only option he had would be to charge in at full speed!</p><br/><p>With the Seven Star Azure Dragon in his hands, he pointed towards the battlefield as he explained, \u201cThe Northern Wei army is like a meat bun! I will take the lead, and you guys will stay on my flanks. Charge and do not pause for a moment! Charge with all you have and sliced this meat bun in two! Slice it to the very end! It will be a simple affair!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, even the usually reckless assassins couldn\u2019t help but take in a breath of cold air!</p><br/><p>Five men and horses fighting a 400,000 strong army! Such an action was almost crazy! No, it was already considered extremely crazy! However, Ling Tian still dared to say that it would be an easy affair!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian was not thinking about it much and only treated the soldiers in front of him as a meat bun. As long as he could pierce through the outer bun, he would be able to quickly slice the bun into two. Now that their enemies were celebrating a victory in front of their eyes, this was definitely to his advantage!</p><br/><p>As Ling Nineteen answered Ling Tian, he felt as though the skies above him darkened and the four Shui Family experts arrived from the sky! With a strong gale, the men below were blown around and unsteady. The four of their swords were like four venomous vipers with a single target: Ling Xiao!</p><br/><p>\u201cProtect the Marshal with all your strength!\u201d Blood almost sprayed out of Ling Nineteen\u2019s eyes! He had also dashed forward with his blade in an almost suicidal manner! The young noble is here! He will be here in just a short while! If we were to let Marshal Ling die at this moment, even dying 10,000 times wouldn\u2019t be enough to redeem ourselves!</p><br/><p>Ling Twenty, Ling Twenty-one, and Ling Twenty-two also had the same idea! They abandoned their opponents and charged towards Ling Xiao! While the four of their martial arts were comparable to these Shui Family experts, the four of them were already fatigued from battle. How could they be compared to these four experts who were in their prime condition?</p><br/><p>Their blades met and sparks burst in all direction! Ling Nineteen and the other three took a few steps back together! The four Shui Family experts grinned malevolently and attacked again! Ling Xiao was right in front of their eyes! Their four swords stabbed out without any hesitation!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Things would become much easier with these elixirs in his possession. \u201cIf there isn\u2019t anything else, I won\u2019t disturb older brother and will treat their injuries first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, go ahead. There isn\u2019t a need for you to be too anxious either. It will only be considered a perfect treatment if they can absorb all of the effects of the medicine.\u201d Justice waved his hands to send Ling Tian off.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian turned around and sped away quickly.</p><br/><p>Justice stood on the spot laughing as he saw how Ling Tian escaped from him as though he was the death reaper. Even if you are a crafty little brat, you will still have to drink my leftover bath water. You would never imagine that those pills in your hand were refined from the herbs of your warehouse. My rewards this time were truly great. Even if I still cannot treat them like rice, I can still enjoy them as snacks. This brat has finally reached my expectations but he still seems to be wary of me finding trouble with him. Hehe, this is also good\u2026 In fact, why should I be concerned about those rumors? Compared to the longing of a martial arts expert, those rumors are completely worthless. Who would have imagined that this little brat would actually be so nervous? This daddy\u2019s martial arts just experienced a breakthrough and I have not been able to find an appropriate opponent to help stabilize my breakthrough. In the past, that brat Ling Tian wasn\u2019t powerful enough but he has so many comrades who can enter my sight now. Without satisfying this daddy, how could I bear to leave?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian hurriedly ran into the secret chamber while panting to catch his breath. He wasn\u2019t afraid of Justice finding trouble with him because of the rumors, but rather he was afraid of Justice disappearing at this very moment. Justice was truly like a human treasure chest and he was even able to take out bottles of such heaven-defying pills! How extravagant!</p><br/><p>Li Xue, Ling Jian, Ling Chen, and Yu BingYan\u2019s injuries would be recovered in half a month and Ling Tian wanted to make use of the time when Justice was present to uproot Yu BingYan\u2019s Divine Black Negative Meridians. Purging the Divine Black Negative Meridians would definitely require the combined effort of himself, Ling Chen and Li Xue to ensure that everything went smoothly. But with the three of them occupied, the only expert left in the Courtyard would be Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>After the ambush of the Lei Family, the alarm bells in Ling Tian\u2019s heart had all sounded. Ling Tian would never allow the Yu Family to launch a sneak attack when he was purging the Divine Black Negative Meridians. Furthermore, the three of them couldn\u2019t be disturbed in the slightest when purging the Divine Black Negative Meridians. If just one of them was distracted, all four of them would probably enter into cultivation deviation together!</p><br/><p>With Justice present, he was definitely the number one choice to watch the Courtyard. Thus, Ling Tian wanted to settle this matter as quickly as possible. With Justice guarding the Courtyard, who would dare to disturb him? Nothing would go wrong for sure! Furthermore, arranging a fight with Justice, be it for himself, Ling Chen, Li Xue or Ling Jian, it was definitely a good chance to increase their strength. How would Ling Tian be willing to let go of such a chance?</p><br/><p>Thus, not only was Justice looking forward to this battle, even Ling Tian was hoping for this battle to happen. In fact, Ling Tian even wanted to allow Ling Chi and the others to fight Justice as well. However, their realms were just too far away from Justice\u2019s and after being treated by Justice, they were like mice whenever they saw him\u2026</p><br/><p>Shaking his head joyfully, Ling Tian entered the secret chamber. There were three beautiful ladies, Ling Chen, Yu BingYan, and Li Xue, seated cross-legged in the secret chamber. They looked like they were brimming with energy with their faces red. No one would think that they had just recovered from their injuries.</p><br/><p>Noticing Ling Tian\u2019s arrival, the three of them opened their eyes together and all of their tender gazes were fixed on Ling Tian. Ling Chen then asked, \u201cYoung Noble, did senior Justice agree?\u201d Ling Chen was extremely grateful to Justice for protecting the Courtyard and would not address Justice with a \u2018him\u2019 like how Ling Tian did. Thus, she decided to call him \u2018senior\u2019!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cWith this young noble taking action personally, how would I fail? Haha\u2026 That fellow is still delighted because he thinks that everything has gone according to his little plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian said those words, all three of the ladies had a different expression. Ling Chen was filled with joy and together with her unconditional trust in Ling Tian, she felt as though it was only right for Ling Tian to be so successful. Yu BingYan had a look of worship on her face. As for Li Xue, she rolled her eyes in disdain and looked as though she was about to retch.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen let out a smile and said softly, \u201cYoung Noble, Justice is the savior of our Ling Residence. How can you address senior as such!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was stunned for a moment before laughing out loud, \u201cChen\u2019er, you are the one in the wrong. Your \u2018senior Justice\u2019 is not one to bother about such pleasantries. If you were to address him as senior and yourself as a junior, he would probably leave by tomorrow. That old brat is just far too good at destroying things and has almost emptied out our whole warehouse. However, we also did not lose out at all. Look at what this is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue was the most knowledgeable one and gasped, \u201cIt is actually the Heaven Reversing Restoration Pill? And more than one?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian nodded his head, \u201cThat\u2019s right, it is the Heaven Reversing Restoration Pill. This old brat is truly generous. Hearing that all of your wounds have not recovered, he gave me a bottle with more than ten pills inside. With these pills in our hands, it will be able to make up for the weakness of our bodies from the injuries that we had suffered. It truly came at the right time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue immediately cursed, \u201cSpoiled brat! You are actually using this rare treasure to recover your strength?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at Li Xue and coughed awkwardly before saying, \u201cThere isn\u2019t any point in talking about that. That old brat definitely has more of it and I will just ask for a few more from him afterward. We will make use of today to adjust all of our conditions to the peak. Starting tomorrow the three of us will work together to purge BingYan\u2019s Divine Black Negative Meridians!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue was taken aback for a moment. \u201cWon\u2019t that be too hasty? BingYan was severely wounded recently and while she has already recovered from her injuries, she still has a reduced vitality and her body needs to be nourished back to its peak. Why don\u2019t you give BingYan a Heaven Reversing Restoration Pill to help her regain her vitality?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shook his head and said, \u201cWe must definitely not do so. BingYan consumed two Great Cyclic Pellets during the battle and the effects of the Great Cyclic Pellet are currently at its peak. Furthermore, BingYan had already taken a pill this month. While her vitality was harmed during the battle, the Divine Black Negative Meridians have also been weakened. With the Great Cyclic Pellet still in effect, this is the best period to purge her Divine Black Negative Meridians! If we recklessly allow her to take the Heaven Reversing Restoration Pill, the Heaven Reversing Restoration Pill would only strengthen her Divine Black Negative Meridians. After all the three of us adjust our condition to our peaks, we will let BingYan take another Great Cyclic Pellet. I will then circulate my pure Yang inner qi to stimulate the Divine Black Negative Meridians. Ling Chen will then use her Divine Ice Formula to suck out all the frost toxins slowly. Li Xue, you will be behind Ling Chen to absorb all the frost toxins from Ling Chen\u2019s body and purge it from your body with your own inner qi. At that time, BingYan\u2019s Divine Black Negative Meridians will be completely purged and it will be the best time for her to consume the Heaven Reversing Restoration Pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d The three ladies were enlightened and could not help but look at each other. Yu BingYan pitifully looked at the three others in the room and couldn\u2019t help but worry, \u201cWould Tian\u2019ge or my older sisters be in danger?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled warmly, \u201cAs long as we are not distracted by anything, there won\u2019t be any danger. Xue\u2019er and Chen\u2019er\u2019s body are of the same element as yours. The frost toxins in your body are of the same element as their inner qi and it would only be a matter of time for them to expel it. There wouldn\u2019t be any form of danger. However, we will require two days at the very least and we can\u2019t be hasty for success. With Justice currently helping us to guard the Courtyard, our only source of danger has been removed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue muttered in a low voice, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, with Justice and Ling Jian guarding us outside, nothing will go wrong for sure. Can both little sister Chen and I transform the frost toxins into our own inner qi? It would be a waste to miss such a good opportunity. After all, the Divine Black Negative Meridians sits at the forefront of all frost toxins. Furthermore, it rests in the meridians of the human body naturally and is also of the extreme Yin element. It should be extremely helpful to our Divine Ice Formula. If we can assimilate the frost toxins into our bodies\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian frowned and replied, \u201cI had such intentions originally but there are great risks involved. With every advantage there would also be a disadvantage. The moment the frost toxins are stimulated, it will definitely be difficult to control them. It will already be a challenge to purge the frost toxins out and if your inner qi is unable to assimilate them\u2026\u201d After pausing for a moment, Ling Tian shook his head and said in frustration, \u201cIt is best to reconsider this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue nodded her head, \u201cThis was originally a huge problem. I will act according to the circumstances. The moment we begin purging the frost toxins, we will be able to determine the strength of the toxins. If we are able to, I will preserve the frost toxins after sucking them out from BingYan\u2019s body. Then, Ling Chen and I will try to refine it together. If not, I will give it up on the spot. With the Heaven Reversing Restoration Pill to aid us, the dangers will be greatly reduced.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian thought for a moment before agreeing. However, he still warned with a heavy tone, \u201cYou must not take any risks.\u201d He was truly afraid of Li Xue\u2019s fearless personality. If she were to forcefully preserve the toxins beyond her abilities, things would truly be disastrous. He knew that while the frost toxins were extremely frightening. If the two ladies were able to refine them, it would be a powerful source of pure XianTian energy. Ling Tian was afraid that Li Xue wouldn\u2019t be able to resist the allure of such a powerful energy and forcefully attempt to refine it.</p><br/><p>Li Xue chuckled, \u201cAfter purging the frost toxins, you can help BingYan cut off her connection to us and aid her to recover her vitality to prevent her from suffering a backlash from the frost toxins. As for Ling Chen and I, don\u2019t worry. Both of us cultivate the Divine Ice Formula and are more familiar with frost toxins than you. You do not have to worry about us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she said that, Ling Tian became even more anxious and said bitterly, \u201cBig sister, you better not joke about such a thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue broke out into a wide grin, \u201cBig brother, don\u2019t worry. Everything will be fine.\u201d Hearing Ling Tian calling her big sister, she mimicked his words by calling him big brother.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan and Ling Chen could not help but burst out into laughter as well.</p></div>\n</div>"}

A speedy and absolute victory! Thus after Yu LiuQing died, Yu ManLou had no choice but to use his younger brother, Yu ManTang. Only Yu ManTang would be able to accomplish such a feat. After all, Yu ManLou needed to stay back in the headquarters of the Yu Family to maintain the morale of his family.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was pretty confident that he could obtain a victory. He had already given the orders for all his troops to retreat back to Bright Jade City after exterminating the Wu Empire. At that time, Yu ManTang would be fully in charge of the battle with the Moon Deity Empire and Yu ManLou was also intentionally sending Yu ManTang out. As for the final battle with Ling Tian, Yu ManLou would not trust anyone else but himself! It would be the safest if he personally made a move!</p><br/><p>Another reason was also because Yu ManLou received the news that the 3000 soldiers that Lei ZhenTian led to ambush the Ling Family Courtyard were completely wiped out without a single survivor!</p><br/><p>After receiving this piece of news, Yu ManLou was completely dumbfounded! He had almost fallen from his chair as well!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was extremely clear about the strength of the Lei Family\u2019s experts led by Lei ZhenTian. Especially the martial arts of the three deacons and Lei ZhenTian himself were something that even he needed to treat with respect. Furthermore, the Lei Family still had another six elders and dozens of other experts. Not a single one of them was a character that could be dealt with easily.</p><br/><p>This strength was already the absolute peak which the Lei Family could muster. However, they were all wiped out in a single battle with the Ling Family Courtyard without a single person leaving alive! On top of that, Ling Tian was absent from the Courtyard during that period of time but such a baffling event had still occurred.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou knew that if his Yu Family were to face the elites of Lei ZhenTian, while he would be able to achieve victory in the end, the price which he would have to pay would be extremely heavy and his victory would be a Pyrrhic one. It would be impossible for him to wipe out all of the Lei Family elites without leaving a single person alive!</p><br/><p>However, the Ling Family Courtyard was actually able to achieve such a feat! Just what kind of strength was Ling Tian hiding? How many more trump cards did Ling Tian still have hidden?</p><br/><p>Hearing this piece of news, even someone with Yu ManLou\u2019s composure could not help but be startled. Furthermore, he could not deny that he was feeling a tinge of fear! Such a feeling was something that Yu ManLou had never felt before in his life!</p><br/><p>Thus, Yu ManLou resolutely decided to make good use of XiMen Sa and Yu ManTang. At this time, he needed to gather all of the strength that he could. Regardless of what kind of ambitions XiMen Sa had, at the very least, XiMen Sa had value to Yu ManLou presently.</p><br/><p>As for the future\u2026 who would be able to foretell the future?</p><br/><p>After settling this matter, Yu ManLou sent out another order: All the commoners were to be conscripted! Regardless of whether or not they belonged to Northern Wei or Western Han, as long as they were part of the Yu Family\u2019s territory, all the healthy young men were to join the army and be trained properly.</p><br/><p>These soldiers would become the backup force for the Yu Family in the future.</p><br/><p>When facing Ling Tian, Yu ManLou would never dream of defeating him in a single battle. This would definitely be a long battle! Thus, it was necessary to ensure that he had a constant supply of soldiers.</p><br/><p>The thing which angered Yu ManLou the most was his third brother Yu ManTian. When that b*stard was feeling bored, he actually had the cheek to find Yu ManLou and say that since he had nothing better to do, he wanted to go to Sky Bearing to have some fun\u2026</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou flew into a rage on the spot! He ferociously beat up the boorish Yu ManTian before locking him up! Go to Sky Bearing? Do you think that I don\u2019t know why you want to go to Sky Bearing? You have obviously taken a liking to that brat Ling Tian and want to go and play with him. But do you think that the present circumstances would permit you to enter Sky Bearing?</p><br/><p>Besides that, who was Ling Tian? He was the biggest enemy of our Yu Family! As the Third Master of the Yu Family, you actually want to go to Sky Bearing? Are you going to find him for fun or for your death?!</p><br/><p>Besides that, for the Lei Family to launch an ambush at Sky Bearing, any wise individual would be able to deduce that our Yu Family had a hand behind the matter. It would be great if Ling Tian doesn\u2019t seek trouble with us but you actually want to go and find him at his doorstep? What am I going to do if war breaks out with Ling Tian when you are in Sky Bearing?</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was angered by his third brother to the point he lost his appetite.</p><br/><p>In the secret chamber.</p><br/><p>The charcoals at the edge of the room were indeed premium products and were still burning. However, they seemed to be incapable of raising the temperature in the chamber. The secret chamber had already been transformed into a freezer! Furthermore, it was ten times colder than an ordinary freezer!</p><br/><p>The four water tubs at the corners of the room were placed there so that they could wash up after the purging of the poison was complete. However, they were now four frozen tubs and each had turned into a solid slab of ice. With the increase in volume, the four water tubs had also cracked open with ice protruding from the cracks.</p><br/><p>The paleness on Yu BingYan\u2019s face had disappeared and her face was now slightly pinkish. While she was currently still unconscious, it was obvious that she was no longer in danger. After the large majority of the frost toxins were purged, the medicinal effects of the Great Cyclic Pellet and flood dragon inner pellet were gradually being released. As long as she passed through this final challenge, Yu BingYan would definitely receive a large number of benefits.</p><br/><p>Above Ling Tian\u2019s head, smoke could be seen rising from the top of his head and it was an indication of his over-exhaustion. After channeling his inner qi for a full three days and nights, even with Ling Tian\u2019s tenth level of the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula, he was already at his limit. Currently, Ling Tian was only hanging in there with his willpower and was almost exhausting his vitality just so he could hang in there!</p><br/><p>Both Ling Chen and Li Xue also looked fatigued but it wasn\u2019t a big effect on their mind. After all, they cultivated the Divine Ice Formula and as long as they circulated their inner qi in this frosty environment, they would only gain benefits and would not be harmed. They were fatigued because of the exhaustion of their spiritual qi and also because they had not slept for a full three days and nights. This was especially true for Li Xue who was always in an extremely tensed-up state. The pressure that she endured wasn\u2019t any less than Ling Tian. For her to be able to hold up until now was already considered a miracle!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian used his spiritual sense to scan Yu BingYan\u2019s body and realized that more than 90% of Yu BingYan\u2019s Divine Black Negative Meridians had been purged already. The remaining small portion was in her meridians but the Divine Black Negative Meridians beside her heart had completely disappeared. Replacing it was a bright red color.</p><br/><p>This was a sign of good health!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian heaved a sigh of relief and could finally be at ease. He directed the inner qi in Yu BingYan\u2019s body to circulate around her meridians again and transformed his pure Yang inner qi into an extremely gentle force to slowly repair Yu BingYan\u2019s damaged meridians. After a full 36 cycles, Ling Tian retracted his inner qi back into his body to adjust his own body. During any ordinary time, Ling Tian would have definitely given this inner qi to Yu BingYan instead of taking it back. It can be imagined just how exhausted Ling Tian currently was.</p><br/><p>After retracting his inner qi, Ling Tian flicked his left hand and a ball of wind was shot towards Li Xue\u2019s left hand.</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s body shook and she woke up from her daze. She then looked at Ling Tian only to see him nodding his head. Li Xue immediately understood what Ling Tian meant and the white gas that was being emanated out from her left hand had disappeared. From this moment on, all of the frosty qi that had been absorbed by Ling Chen and Li Xue would be the greatest supplement for them.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a sigh of regret. Despite the large amount of frosty qi, both Li Xue and Ling Chen were only able to receive such a small amount that was even less than the tip of the iceberg. It was truly a pity!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at the situation of his body and was certain that it wasn\u2019t a big deal. At the same time, some of his inner qi was also recovered. However, after not moving for a full three days and nights, his whole body was truly stiff. After trying to loosen up his body, he could hear cracking sounds all over his body and Ling Tian felt as though he had turned into a zombie.</p><br/><p>Behind Yu BingYan, Ling Chen let out a long breath and removed her hand from Yu BingYan\u2019s back. After removing her hand from Yu BingYan\u2019s back, she placed it on her inner core and adjusted her own condition. This action of hers signified that the last bit of frosty qi within Yu BingYan\u2019s body had been absorbed!</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan\u2019s skin had already turned back to its original color and the purplish frosty qi which covered it previously had disappeared completely.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s spiritual sense swept through Yu BingYan\u2019s body and he felt that the inner qi in Yu BingYan\u2019s body was like a boundless river that had no end. Her inner qi nourished the previously damaged meridians and went a cycle through her meridians before returning to her inner core.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan\u2019s body no longer had a hidden danger. In the process of treating her Divine Black Negative Meridians, her Conception and Governing Vessels were opened up and the large remaining medicinal energy transformed into a large source of inner qi. Yu BingYan had completely rid herself of her ailment and had taken a step into the ranks of the experts.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was elated. Perhaps this was the reward for her many years of suffering?</p><br/><p>With a soft moan, Yu BingYan gradually regained her consciousness and opened her eyes slowly. She felt as though everything before her was extremely clear and her body was warm and comfortable. The bone-chilling feeling at her chest was no longer present! Yu BingYan immediately knew that the Divine Black Negative Meridians that had plagued her for all her life had been completely purged!</p></div>\n</div>"}

What exquisite inner strength!\u201d Ling Tian cheered, \u201cLi Xue, you did not let down the name of \u2018 Xue 1 \u2018 indeed! You are indeed a lass who has come out from the mountains!\u201d Amid the laughter, a loud metallic clang sounded, and Ling Tian parried another one of his opponent\u2019s strikes!</p><br/><p>Li Xue was angered to the point she wanted to quarrel with Ling Tian again. The first half of Ling Tian\u2019s sentence was still reasonable. But what did he mean by \u2018indeed a lass who has come out from the mountains\u2019? <em>In what way is the strength of my Divine Ice Formula related to this? How infuriating! A leopard will never change its spots even after reincarnating into a second life! A casual remark from him is enough to drive me insane! Just wait for me to grab hold of that belly of yours and yank it a full 180 degrees!</em></p><br/><p>However, being trapped in an intense battle, how would Li Xue have the time to find trouble with Ling Tian? Li Xue clenched her teeth and a chilly glow shot out from her eyes as she vented her frustrations on the six assassins in front of her! Her inner qi shot up to an unprecedented height and her petite figure weaved around the sharp sword lights nimbly like a bolt of lightning. The fog surrounding her became thicker and thicker and the ground beneath her slowly froze into a thick layer of ice!</p><br/><p>With a \u2018peng\u2019 sound, a green-dressed assassin fell flat on his face and a thick layer of ice formed on his head, dying without a single grunt! Due to the thick fog in front of him, another assassin could not see clearly and ended up tripping on the dead assassin\u2019s head. He then felt a cracking feeling underneath his feet and as he looked down, he could not help but despair!</p><br/><p>After receiving a palm strike from Li Xue, the dead assassin\u2019s head was frozen into a block of ice and became extremely brittle. Upon being stepped on by his fellow assassin, his head was shattered but not a single droplet of blood could be seen. Instead, the only things that could be seen were solid blocks of brain matter and flesh clumped together in the ice, scattered all around like an exploded watermelon.</p><br/><p>An assassin should have been extremely used to such a gory sight, and nothing should disturb him. However\u2026</p><br/><p>This assassin let out an angry roar and just when he was about to charge forward, a silhouette flashed in front of him and he felt his shoulder turn cold as a dainty hand left his shoulder. The next moment, he felt as though the right side of his body began to turn completely numb and he could not take a single step!</p><br/><p>A sword charged straight to his chest and just when he was about to shout out, \u201cIt\u2019s me!\u201d, he realized that his mouth couldn\u2019t move an inch. He then witnessed his own brother stabbing a sword right through his chest\u2026</p><br/><p>At this moment, he could clearly feel that his heart was punctured before swiftly losing all feeling as he closed his eyes and took his final breath.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s sword danced around and a vigorous bout of sword qi shot towards the skies, forcefully breaking through the lockdown of the nine swords above his head. With the opening above his head, Ling Tian then shot up fifty feet into the air! The nine people below him then spread out in retreat and tilted their swords towards the sky facing Ling Tian. At the same time, their eagle-like gazes were locked onto Ling Tian\u2019s figure emotionlessly as though they did not even see the deaths of their comrades! They did not even blink a single time!</p><br/><p>They were truly top-notch assassins, capable of viewing their life and death with contempt!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian finally rose up to a height of sixty feet, and the force of his jump was spent. The sword in his hand began to spin around and his figure formed a spinning top, \u201cBlood Slaughter Pavilion?\u201d</p><br/><p>The nine people below continued staring at Ling Tian without a single one giving a response!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then gave out a sinister laugh, \u201cI wonder how many assassins the Blood Slaughter Pavilion has to serve as training for my sword?!\u201d All of a sudden, a loud whistle sounded, and Ling Tian began spinning faster as he began his descent. When he descended to 30 feet above ground, a realistic looking sword net had condensed around his body and Ling Tian looked like a bright silver top descending from the skies!</p><br/><p>If Li Xue saw the scene in front of her, she would definitely shout out in surprise, \u201cFlying saucer? UFO?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, it was a pity that Li Xue was currently tied up with the other assassins and did not witness the scene. Furthermore, the scene only persisted for a short instant before a brilliant sword qi lit up the sky as though there was an angel descending from the heavens!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s figure was already concealed in the brilliant light and the river of light majestically descended as though it wanted to destroy the earth!</p><br/><p>The assassin who was at the very front charged forward with his sword and upon coming into contact with the brilliant light was shot out 30 feet away. His body was covered all over with slashes, with the depth of every wound reaching his bones! While his eyes were still opened wide, his eyes no longer had any spirit!</p><br/><p>Eyes like these would only appear on the dead! Ling Tian was used to calling it \u2018fish eyes\u2019! Everyone knew that only the eyes of a fish would not be able to spin around, just like the eyes of a dead man\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s sword charged right into the camp of the other eight assassins like a cyclone filled with destruction, death, and killing intent! All of his pent-up frustrations could finally be vented in this moment!</p><br/><p>Unrestrained and uninhibited! At this moment, Ling Tian had such a feeling!</p><br/><p>Kill! KILL KILL KILL KILL KILL KILL KILL!!!!</p><br/><p>Man and sword as one! This was the true man and sword as one!</p><br/><p>The eyes of the eight individuals were filled with despair and determination. Like a moth flying into the flames, they valiantly received Ling Tian\u2019s attack! Their eight swords stabbed into the brilliant sword light in unison!</p><br/><p>Facing such an attack, retreat was not an option and fighting was the only option! However, there wasn\u2019t a chance for them to survive if they were to fight! Could the might of such an attack be blocked by a human? Even the combined force of the nine assassins was completely insignificant! As an assassin, their failure would mean death! Furthermore, they were facing the god of massacre, Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>How was it possible for Ling Tian to let them leave alive?</p><br/><p>\u201cDing ding ding ding ding\u2026\u201d the sounds of metal clashing sounded and the sky was lit up brightly as though the sky was filled with fireworks!</p><br/><p>Bits of swords shot out in all directions and towers of blood sprayed out in the surroundings! Pieces of dismembered limbs, still carrying with them the warmth of a human body, began to fly out in all directions! In just a single exchange, not a single one of the eight assassins was left with a complete corpse! They were only left with pieces of flesh with the largest piece not exceeding the size of a palm!</p><br/><p>The assassin who died the first was the luckiest! After all, he was at the very least left with a complete corpse!</p><br/><p>Not too far away, the dozens of burly men began puking! <em>What kind of swordplay was this? Even if you wanted to dice them up into a thousand pieces, you should at least leave their skeleton behind right?</em> Currently, even their skin and bones were sent flying alongside their flesh! Only a single phrase could describe the scene in front of them: Bones crushed and ashes scattered!</p><br/><p>The brilliant sword light then vanished and Ling Tian reappeared panting heavily. His hair was messy, face pale and he had countless thin scratches on his body with every wound bleeding slightly. Combined together, it was as though Ling Tian was drenched in blood!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian\u2019s posture was still upright with a dense killing intent shooting out from his eyes! His sword was pointed towards the ground diagonally with a stream of blood flowing down the body of the sword\u2026</p><br/><p>Not too far away in the dense fog, the sounds of punches continuously sounded with a miserable groan accompanying each one. Following that, the fog began to disperse as though being faced with a violent wind and the battlefield was displayed before everyone\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Li Xue stood in the center of the battlefield silently with her left shoulder and chest dyed red with blood. Her expression was tranquil and there were six frozen corpses lying by her feet\u2026</p><br/><p>The sixteen elite assassins of the Blood Slaughter Pavilion were wiped out in a single battle!</p><br/><p>This was also because of their ill luck. According to the report they had received, Ling Tian was the only one they had to be concerned with. All of their plans were made to deal with Ling Tian alone! This resulted in them making an unforgivable mistake!</p><br/><p>If the sixteen of them were to ambush Ling Tian alone, they definitely wouldn\u2019t have been wiped out and would have a fairly good chance of emerging victorious. However, none of them could predict that a Li Xue would appear by Ling Tian\u2019s side. Furthermore, Li Xue\u2019s martial arts also stood at the peak of the continent and her ruthlessness was no less than Ling Tian\u2019s!</p><br/><p>Thus, while the annihilation of the Blood Slaughter Pavilion wasn\u2019t within their expectations, it was fully reasonable!</p><br/><p>Looking at the remains around him, Ling Tian let out a sinister smirk! No matter how powerful the Blood Slaughter Pavilion was, after their loss in Sky Bearing and losing sixteen top-notch assassins here, it would be impossible for them to make a comeback! This would also eliminate a source of worry for Ling Tian in the future!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a cruel smile and raised his elegant hands up, pointing his bloodied sword at the dozens of burly men. This action of his immediately stirred a huge commotion as all the burly men thought that Ling Tian was about to attack them and began to escape in all directions. There were even a few who were previously shocked by the bloody scene in front of them, and after being further frightened by Ling Tian further, they collapsed on the ground and died from fear\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then let out a chilly, disdainful smile of pity and said calmly, \u201cGo back and inform Yu ManLou that he should be more careful when choosing his men in future! He should send out men who are more useful and make sure to plan carefully. At the very least, he should not send out trash to disgrace themselves!\u201d</p><br/><p>After pausing for a moment, he bellowed, \u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>1: Xue -Xue means snow</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had already exerted all his available strength and was even using the unique skill of the DongFang Family, but all his strength was actually forced back by Yu ManTian to the point that his internal organs received a huge amount of damage! His original intention to feign weakness somehow became real, making him depressed beyond belief! All of this was based off an inaccurate intelligence report that made him greatly underestimate Yu ManTian.</p><br/><p>The reason why Yu ManTian had such insane martial skills was because of his attitude of a martial arts fanatic. Six months ago when he dueled with Ye BaiFei, he won, but miserably with seven stab wounds. As the saying goes, \u2018one will bravely change when met with shame\u2019. He had poured his heart and soul into training, experiencing a breakthrough and reaching the peak of the lower gold jade tier! On the way to Sky Bearing, he again suffered a loss under Ling Tian, thus making him more determined, and naturally his cultivation progressed insanely fast.</p><br/><p>In an instant, DongFang JingLei had already lost, and seeing all the guards nearby him looking furious he immediately admitted defeat. In the event that one of them made a wrong comment and created a huge war, regardless who won or lost, bad blood with the Yu Family would be set in stone!</p><br/><p>From Ling Tian\u2019s viewpoint as a spectator, the original intention of DongFang JingLei was clear. Putting himself in JingLei\u2019s shoes, this was the best strategy that JingLei could use. However, it was a mistake for JingLei to employ the techniques of the World Defying Hidden Dragon Manual. This only served to further fire up Yu ManTian into using his maximum strength, and so his plan backfired! But Ling Tian still had a good impression of DongFang JingLei. His act of forcibly swallowing down his blood was not to save face but to preserve his vitality. Furthermore, to admit defeat with such a graceful demeanor, just his attitude would earn the respect of others!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian panted a few times, before shouting out, \u201cAwesome! Today\u2019s battle was so many times better than the one I had with that black dressed kid! The DongFang Family indeed lives up to its name! DongFang JingLei, your skills are superb, your fame definitely stems from your merit!\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei could only laugh bitterly. To prevent a loss of vital energy, he had forcibly swallowed his blood, which was exceedingly harmful to him. Right now, his face was deathly pale as he spoke, \u201cSince Third Master had enjoyed it, could I have the honor of inviting you for a cup of tea and to further improve our relations?\u201d He might have been injured, but he didn\u2019t forget his original mission. Strike while the iron is hot, if he could befriend the Yu Family, then even a critical injury would be gladly taken by him!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian sized up him, before commenting, \u201cIt would be better if you go rest and recover first. This Third Master still has to visit the BeiMing\u2019s and the NanGong\u2019s. I hope that their experts would be at your standard at least. I\u2019ll bid farewell first!\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei smiled as he gave a salute, \u201cThen I shall not keep Third Master.\u201d His attitude was natural and unrestrained, as though no fight had taken place between them.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face revealed a warm smile as he appraised DongFang JingLei. In his heart, the DongFang Family was greatly elevated. For a family to raise such a child, one could see that the family was not an ordinary one, at least far above the standards of the NanGong Family. It also seemed like the DongFang Family were a group of concealed talents.</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei also smiled at Ling Tian as he said, \u201cJingLei will pay a visit to young noble Ling in the next few days, as it seems like young noble will be very busy today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed as he replied, \u201cYour Highness is too polite.\u201d Deep in his heart, he was filled with elation; DongFang JingLei\u2019s eyes betrayed some of his thoughts, as though there was another meaning behind that. What purpose could he have?</p><br/><p>After sending off Ling Tian and Yu ManTian, DongFang JingLei\u2019s face turned from pale white to ashen. He could no longer endure it and returned to his room to rest.</p><br/><p>The Yu Family\u2019s cultivation methods were definitely not ordinary and were above the methods used by all the other Great Families. Even the well-known World Defying Hidden Dragon Manual wasn\u2019t a match! Looking at Yu ManTian\u2019s back, Ling Tian started to develop more plans of his own.</p><br/><p>The next stop was the BeiMing Family, and the result was just as expected by Ling Tian; the top expert of their family only lasted for the time it took to drink a cup of tea under Yu ManTian\u2019s frenzied assault!</p><br/><p>This gave Ling Tian a huge surprise. Yu ManTian\u2019s skills were a cut above the rest, to the point that he was only a notch lower than Ye QingChen who came from Beyond Heavens. However, Ling Tian never felt that Yu ManTian\u2019s martial arts had reached this current level!</p><br/><p>After going through battles with the XiMen and DongFang Family, Yu ManTian still seemed to have defeated the BeiMing Family with ease! There was a limit to one\u2019s energy and strength, and while Yu ManTian\u2019s energy was pure and exquisite, it wasn\u2019t forged out of steel! However, he got fiercer the more he fought, which puzzled Ling Tian to no end. Based on his assumptions, Yu ManTian would have to spend some time to get rid of the BeiMing Family, then ending with a draw together in the fight with the NanGong Family.</p><br/><p>However, Yu ManTian was like a lively dragon and an animated tiger, jumping about excitedly all over the place! This was completely different from Ling Tian\u2019s original assumptions, as his sources told him that these people should have cultivations similar to Ling Jian, or even more profound! The other time when he was fighting against Ling Jian, the battle was so bitter, so how could he be so relaxed after three consecutive rounds?</p><br/><p>After they walked out from the BeiMing Family, Ling Tian passionately put his hands on Yu ManTian\u2019s shoulders, complimenting him nonstop, but secretly releasing a thin thread of spiritual sense and inserting it into his meridians. Surprisingly, he found out that although they had seen better days, Yu ManTian\u2019s injuries and fatigue were nowhere near as serious as he thought they would be. What was the reason behind this?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was only blindly looking at it from the point of pure martial arts and had come to a dead end in his thoughts. When Yu ManTian was facing those three experts, it was different from his battle with Ling Jian. When comparing notes, while they might be competitive and insist on fighting to the end, no one would resort to a life-and-death battle without a good reason.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Jian and Yu ManTian were embroiled in a life and death battle the other time. Every move made was to reap the opponent\u2019s life, leading them to dance at the doors of death quite a few times! Furthermore, Ling Jian\u2019s movement techniques originated from Ling Tian and were ephemeral and unpredictable. His intangible killing intent was locked onto Yu ManTian, and that also had an adverse effect on his performance. As for all these duels, Yu ManTian constantly had the chance to recover. Also, since he kept winning, it caused his morale to soar towards unprecedented heights; so why would he feel tired?</p><br/><p>Smoky Thea Tower was now right in front of them, but it had vastly changed from its current appearance a few days ago. It had been temporarily closed down and reorganized. Everyone at the lobby was discussing this incident, but no one knew what was going on.</p><br/><p>Two huge banners, tens of feet long, were hung from the top of the roof. The golden words flashing on them were the size of half a room, and together they formed a complete sentence.</p><br/><p>The first banner read, \u201cHeroes from all eight directions converge,\u201d and the other banner read, \u201cBanquet for all heroes under Heavens,\u201d and at the bottom was written \u201cSmoky Thea awaits your presence, do you dare come?\u201d Only when someone came closer could they see what was written on a red cloth and hung on the wall below the two banners.</p><br/><p>\u201cHearing that all heroes under the heavens have gathered in Sky Bearing, we of humble backgrounds are excited beyond belief. The fame of the seven countries and Eight Great Families has rung far and wide. To show our hospitality, Smoky Thea will not be opening for daily reservations, but instead is offering rooms free of charge for those of the Eight Great Families! We hope that this will create a story that will be talked about in Sky Bearing for the next millennia to come, the honor of having such experts residing in our place. To all heroes, we hope to see you here!\u201d Written below this was the location for everyone to gather, the lobby.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll free! My grandma, this Smoky Thea really has got the money. This is no ordinary brothel!\u201d Yu ManTian couldn\u2019t help but whisper, and even the Xue brothers couldn\u2019t help but let out an expression of shock.</p><br/><p>Only Ling Tian smiled bitterly, his original plan was to ask Gu XiYan to empty out the surrounding places around Heavenly Fragrance Pavilion, but he didn\u2019t expect that woman to actually lock down the entire Smoky Thea Tower for this matter! To think that she could raise up such a fuss in just a day and night! Such resolution and determination made Ling Tian extremely pleased; this Gu XiYan was definitely someone who could get things done!</p><br/><p>By doing so, this would cause the different influences to have misgivings as to what Smoky Thea was planning. But whether they felt suspicion or apprehension, so long as one family moved in, the rest of them would rush to move in as well!</p><br/><p>While this might be a trap, in front of the heroes under heavens, this was a matter of face that a great family couldn\u2019t afford to throw away! This was especially so for the words written on the red cloth, \u201cSmoky Thea awaits your presence, do you dare come?\u201d This was a blatant provocation, as though telling everyone, \u201cThose who do not have the guts to even stay here might as well tuck their tails and go home!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

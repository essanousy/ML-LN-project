However, they were all sitting down by the side allowing Ling Tian to massacre their family members as he wished. These two things did not feel good at all.</p><br/><p>It was one thing for them to not have the strength to cleanse the opposition out of their family. However, it was truly a little too much for them to be watching by the side when their reinforcements are here.</p><br/><p>After letting out two dry coughs, Shui ManKong let out a bitter laugh and said, \u201cYoung noble may not know but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled and said, \u201cI understand.\u201d After taking in a deep breath, he repeated himself with a solemn expression, \u201cI really understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of how outrageous their actions or how much they forced you, they are still your family members. Regardless of who emerges as the victor, it will not feel good for you to kill your brothers. I have felt this once before. Thus, let me be the bad guy. I am most suitable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou walked over to Ling Tian\u2019s side and held onto his arm with a comforting gaze. \u201cWith Tian\u2019ge taking action, he not only prevented us from killing our own brethren, he even helped us to thoroughly cleanse our Shui Family. His actions allowed us to prevent the downfall of the Shui Family and our Shui Family must always remember this favor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt a weird feeling in his heart as he heard those words. What is this lass trying to hint by saying those words? These words of hers would be completely proper if they were said by Shui ManKong, but for these words to come out from Shui QianRou\u2019s mouth, it seems as though Shui QianRou was overestimating her status. When lowering his head to look at Shui QianRou, he noticed that Shui QianRou\u2019s expression was solemn but her eyes were rolling about quickly. Ling Tian immediately understood her intentions.</p><br/><p>He never imagined that before the battle even ended, Shui QianRou was already trying to seek benefits for him. She was obviously afraid that he might be too embarrassed to open his mouth and thus decided to take the initiative.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could not help but laugh in his heart. For me to spend such a great deal of effort and not receive anything in return, wouldn\u2019t I be suffering a huge loss? When it is time for me to open my mouth, my heart definitely wouldn\u2019t turn soft regardless of who I am facing. As for being embarrassed, just what is that? I have never heard of it before\u2026</p><br/><p>Despite thinking about that, Ling Tian was truly extremely moved by Shui QianRou\u2019s thoughts and affection.</p><br/><p>At the very start, the two of them were enemies and Shui QianRou\u2019s heart was completely aligned with the interests of her family. But now, when choosing between her family and him, Shui QianRou had chosen him without any hesitation. For her to have such a drastic change in character, just how much did she have to go through?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was extremely satisfied, happy, and gratified.</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong let out a loud laugh, \u201cRou\u2019er, since things have already developed to such a point, what are you still worried about? Besides, with young noble Ling\u2019s strength, even if I want to renege on my words, do you think I will be able to do so? Do you think that he will care if I renege on my words? Do you think there is any meaning?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou giggled and her face flushed red.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cRou\u2019er, you are looking down on your father too much. Didn\u2019t you realize something extremely strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Shui QianRou was a little puzzled. Following which, she stomped her feet in anger, \u201cOnly my father?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled and rubbed his nose, \u201cDid you realize that despite the countless miserable shrieks from the beginning of the battle, not a single Shui Family member has appeared to check on what is going on? Your father has already made sufficient preparations.\u201d As he said that, he looked towards Shui ManKong with a smile that didn\u2019t seem like a smile. \u201cHe was only waiting for a sharp weapon. This time, I will willingly allow someone to make use of me for the first time in my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong began coughing awkwardly, \u201cYoung noble Ling is wise indeed. Ah ah, you are wise indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou never imagined that her father already had some tricks up his sleeves and had even hidden it from her. She could not help but turn around in anger from him with two cold snorts. However, with regards to Ling Tian saying that he willingly allowed someone to make use of him, she immediately jumped to the conclusion that Ling Tian was only willing to be made use of because of his love for her.</p><br/><p>However, she was truly thinking too highly of Ling Tian. Ling Tian was only thinking of how he could make the Shui Family owe him as much as possible. He was only thinking about how he could seize authority in the Shui Family to command their forces. The more they owed him the merrier!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a series of miserable groans could be heard in the hall. Ling Jian and the four assassins kept their weapons and walked over to Ling Tian\u2019s side with their faces and bodies entirely covered with blood!</p><br/><p>In the hall behind them, there wasn\u2019t a single living person left behind! Originally, there could have been someone left, Shui QianHai who had soiled himself from fear. A pity this brat\u2019s guts were truly too cowardly. Not only did he soil his pants in fear, he was even frightened to death!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, a couple of them escaped. Should we give chase?\u201d Ling Jian asked respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need. Senior Family Head Shui will naturally take care of the loose ends. Have you guys gotten addicted to killing?\u201d Ling Tian laughed as he looked at his top subordinate.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Little brother Ling had already given so much for my Shui Family. How can we let little brother Ling expend so much effort for such small things?\u201d Shui ManKong looked at Ling Jian and said with sincerity. While Shui ManKong\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t a match for Ling Jian, his eyesight was still keen. Facing an expert who was a match for Shui WuBo, Shui ManKong would naturally speak carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s the best.\u201d Ling Jian coughed dryly and stood by Ling Tian\u2019s side silently.</p><br/><p>All five of them were injured and the strongest Ling Jian was actually the one who had the most injuries. In order to prevent his brothers from suffering injuries, he had single-handedly fought off the majority of the top-notch experts. He had more than ten open wounds all over his body and he had also suffered from severe internal injuries.</p><br/><p>The other four assassins were also riddled with injuries all over but not a single one of them let out a single groan of weakness.</p><br/><p>However, being able to face the simultaneous attack of almost 200 experts and achieve such a stunning victory, Shui ManKong and the others were already dumbfounded!</p><br/><p>\u201cMen! Quickly treat the injuries of our five brothers.\u201d Shui ManKong roared.</p><br/><p>The subordinates of the Shui Family members flooded into the hall from all directions. All of them were immediately startled the moment they entered and there were some others who could not help but run out to puke shortly after.</p><br/><p>The whole hall was littered with dismembered limbs and fresh blood painted the walls. The puddles of blood in the hall had formed a small pond which was gradually expanding.</p><br/><p>This was no different from a living hell!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong looked towards Ling Tian and said, \u201cLet them clean up this place and we can talk in the inner hall.\u201d With his gaze sweeping past the other Shui Family members, he said, \u201cThe six elders, please follow me. As for the rest, all of you are dismissed. Remember to keep your lips sealed about the matters today.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them acknowledged Shui ManKong\u2019s words in unison.</p><br/><p>In a place not too far away from the great hall, five black-robed experts hiding in the dark glanced at each other and whispered, \u201cThe killing is over. It seems like there isn\u2019t a need for us to take action.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d another person bellowed, \u201cOnly when we see young noble and brother Jian walk out safely can we be sure that everything is fine! Before that, anything can happen. Don\u2019t say a thing and wait quietly.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were Ling One and his four helpers.</p><br/><p>For Ling Tian to bring Ling Jian, Feng, Yun, Lei and Dian with him to the Shui Family, their strength was already sufficient. However, Ling Tian still left a trump card behind as contingency. If everything went smoothly and the direct descendants of the Shui Family did not play any tricks, there wouldn\u2019t be a need for them to appear. However, if the Shui Family wanted to take advantage of Ling Jian\u2019s fatigue and go back on their word, there would be another five of them hidden in the dark to ensure that nothing would go wrong!</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t because of his distrust in Shui ManKong but the fact that they were currently in Heavenly Wind! With his status and position, even if Ling Tian had the heart to take a risk, he no longer had any right to take the risk!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian and the others insisted on rejecting the Shui Family members from treating their injuries and helped each other to wrap up their injuries instead. They then stood behind Ling Tian without saying a single word. Even if they were in the safest place, as long as there were outsiders present, they would never leave Ling Tian\u2019s side!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe cleansing is already over and there will no longer be internal strive within the Shui Family from now on. Family Head can take full control of the Shui Family and this is truly a joyous event.\u201d Ling Tian regained his usual elegance and cupped his fists with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor us to pacify the internal struggle within the family, it is all thanks to the aid of young noble Ling. If not, our Shui Family would already be destroyed by this time.\u201d Shui ManKong hurriedly cupped his fists in response. The more he looked at Ling Tian, the more satisfied he was. He was like a father-in-law sizing up his son-in-law. Even with Ling Tian\u2019s thick skin, he could not help but be a little embarrassed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe aren\u2019t outsiders and it is only right for Ling Tian to give aid.\u201d What Ling Tian meant was that since we already have an alliance, how can we be outsiders?</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Hahaha\u2026\u201d Shui ManKong burst out laughing, \u201cThat\u2019s right, that\u2019s right! We are going to be a true family very soon. This old man shall not stand on ceremony.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was obviously already treating himself as Ling Tian\u2019s father-in-law.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was speechless.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s face flushed red and she dove into her father\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>Both father and daughter had the same thoughts.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian blinked his eyes and realized that his words were truly too easily misunderstood. While that wasn\u2019t his intention, he couldn\u2019t control what Shui ManKong and Shui QianRou thought and thus couldn\u2019t blame them from having strange thoughts.</p><br/><p>The few elders from the Shui Family looked at each other with an enlightened expression of, I finally understand what is going on, Family Head is truly amazing.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at the few of them while sighing in his heart and decided not to make any explanations. With yellow mud staining his shorts, even if it wasn\u2019t sh*t, he wouldn\u2019t be able to explain otherwise.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince things have developed to such an extent, young brother Ling can speak openly. The individuals seated in here are the core of my family and I have absolute trust in them! We can put in some effort for any big or small event in Heavenly Wind!\u201d Shui ManKong looked at Ling Tian with a warm smile.</p><br/><p>His attitude was completely transformed. He still addressed Ling Tian as \u2018young noble Ling\u2019 previously but his address had changed to \u2018young brother Ling\u2019 so quickly.</p><br/><p>When talking about his plans, Ling Tian naturally would not stand on ceremony. With his body bent slightly forward, he smiled, \u201cAfter putting in so much effort, I naturally want to have some benefits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother Ling can talk about all of your plans. As long as this old man is able to help you, I will definitely not hold anything back!\u201d Shui ManKong\u2019s expression became solemn and made a solemn promise!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I shall be straightforward. The members of the Sky Alliance are my men. From now on, the Shui Family has to work together with my Sky Alliance! My condition is: I want\u2026\u201d Ling Tian grit his teeth and his eyes flashed, \u201c\u2026 the whole Heavenly Wind Continent!\u201d</p><br/><p>When it was time for him to raise his conditions, Ling Tian naturally wouldn\u2019t stand on ceremony!</p><br/><p>The whole hall was shocked!</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian did expend a great deal of energy to cleanse the Shui Family and it can be said that he was the key factor which allowed them to turn the situation around, his condition was truly too much. After all, the entire Heavenly Wind Continent contained a huge number of various powers and the number of grievances and hatred truly couldn\u2019t be explained clearly. If Shui ManKong agreed to Ling Tian\u2019s condition, he would be giving up his superior status and pushing the Shui Family to the heart of the troubles!</p><br/><p>The Shui Family would definitely suffer huge losses as a result and they may end up suffering even more losses than cleansing their Shui Family. After all, even if the side branch of the Shui Family had emerged victorious in their internal battle, the Shui Family was still the Shui Family. But according to Ling Tian\u2019s conditions, the Shui Family might disappear completely!</p><br/><p>Taking ten thousand steps back, even if the Shui Family was around after the continent was united, their vitality would definitely be greatly harmed. However, the world would still belong to the Ling Family at that time and they wouldn\u2019t be able to predict how Ling Tian would treat their Shui Family!</p><br/><p>However, beyond all of their expectations\u2026</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong stood up and paced around with his hands behind his back. After a short while, his eyes gleamed and he clenched his teeth. Looking at Ling Tian, a single word escaped his mouth, \u201c\u2026Alright!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d This word had also stunned Ling Tian. He originally intended to raise an exorbitant condition and wait for Shui ManKong to bargain with him. Who would have thought that Shui ManKong did not even bother bargaining with him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head!\u201d The various Elders cried out together.</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong raised his arm to stop them from saying anything else. Returning to his seat, Shui ManKong said with a mellow tone, \u201cI have come to a decision. There isn\u2019t a need to say anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong was both sighing and filled with excitement in his heart. With his son gone, it could be said that his Shui Family no longer had any descendants to carry on its legacy. The only person left was his daughter. This was the first time that Ling Tian was raising conditions with him and for his daughter, so he had to accept Ling Tian\u2019s conditions regardless of what they were!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it would be much better for the world to land in his son-in-law\u2019s hands rather than Yu ManLou\u2019s hands, right?</p><br/><p>Thus, Shui ManKong agreed without negotiating.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian and the others followed behind from afar while Ling Tian and Shui ManKong walked side by side by side at the front. Shui QianRou lowered her head and followed behind them silently, not knowing what she was thinking about. As for Shui ManKong and Ling Tian, they intentionally suppressed their volume.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026the Sky Alliance is situated in Heavenly Wind Continent. On top of the strength of the Sky Alliance, it can be said that Sky Alliance is already deeply rooted in the continent and has far exceeded any powerhouse in Heavenly Wind. With the HuangFu and Song Families annihilated, the only powerhouse capable of fighting against the Sky Alliance would be my Shui Family. With my Shui Family forming an alliance with the Sky Alliance, there wouldn\u2019t be any power in the continent capable of stopping us. While there may be some powers overestimating their abilities and attempting to stop us, it wouldn\u2019t affect the overall situation. I can assure you about this.\u201d This was Shui ManKong\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I will give a strict order to all the organizations affiliated with my Shui Family to assist the Sky Alliance. At the same time, I will order my Shui Family members to avoid participating in military or political affairs. For me to put my words in such a manner, does little brother Ling understand?\u201d Shui ManKong walked forward slowly and said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand a bit.\u201d Ling Tian blinked his eyes and said, \u201cHowever, why wouldn\u2019t you allow the Shui Family to participate in political and military affairs? Even if the continent is united, while the Sky Alliance may be competent in battle, they aren\u2019t proficient in management. With the thousand years of foundation of the Shui Family, even if your vitality is harmed from this cleansing event, I believe that your Shui Family would be able to recover quickly. It would be best if the Shui Family could provide a large amount of management staff and I will not find it inappropriate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong looked at Ling Tian with a smile. \u201cEveryone understands that the greatest backing one can have is absolute strength! It isn\u2019t convenient for the Shui Family to do so now. Even if we want to send out large numbers of talented managers, we will only do that after the continent is united. Besides, if our Shui Family is going to interfere in political matters, there is only a single possibility: the Shui Family is no longer around. At that time, we have to wait until the continent is united as well. If our Shui Family participates in political affairs right now, it would be inevitable for them to form factions and grow arrogant from their deeds. Regardless of whether or not it is intentional, they would definitely end up having needless ambitions and cause unnecessary misunderstandings. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if our Shui Family ends up being destroyed because of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong\u2019s eyes glowed with wisdom, \u201cThe backing of an aristocratic family would indicate endless support from the family. At that time, if an individual is able to grasp the authority of life and death, there wouldn\u2019t be many in the world capable of maintaining their rationality and cool! After you unite the entire continent, you would never allow the existence of an aristocratic family with such a large influence. At that time, it would be the calamity of the Shui Family. You are the person who I have handed Rou\u2019er\u2019s lifetime of happiness to and as her father, I would naturally wish for both your happiness! However, I am still the family head of the Shui Family and even if I know that the Shui Family can no longer regain its former glory, I still wish for the Shui Family to continue existing. At the very least, I hope that the world still knows of our Shui Family before I close my eyes for the last time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian truly praised Shui ManKong\u2019s accurate sights and plans for the future. The direct descendants of a thousand-year-old family truly have their charisma. Shui ManKong was like this as well as Yu ManLou!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong looked at Shui QianRou and chuckled, \u201cLing Tian, you are a talent capable of establishing a new empire. While I am confident that the authority of the Shui Family would not have any changes during mine or Rou\u2019er\u2019s lifetime, I cannot allow my family\u2019s survival to be dependent on an emperor\u2019s temper. This is extremely risky and unwise. If I allow my Shui Family to be in such a passive state, the future of my Shui Family would definitely be filled with uncertainties and troubles. The moment we lose, the Shui Family would vanish forever! Thus, when you truly unite the entire continent, I will find an appropriate time to disperse our entire family. While Water of Heavenly Wind would still be around, the aristocratic Shui Family would no longer exist. Only at that time would the Shui Family be able to build a foundation in the military or political field!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

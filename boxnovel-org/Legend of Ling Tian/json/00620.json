I wonder what rank Miss has in the Ling Family Courtyard? Why do you dare to act in such an unbridled manner? Where is your bearing of an aristocratic family? For you to treat a guest from afar as such, aren\u2019t you afraid of becoming a joke in the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>This question truly touched the taboo in Li Xue\u2019s heart. Everyone in the Ling Family Courtyard had a proper rank and post except for Miss Li Xue\u2026 This made Li Xue extremely frustrated in her heart. Now that salt was being poured on her wound, she could not help but fly into a rage.</p><br/><p>Li Xue snorted and stood up to face the old geezer in front of her with a look of mockery, \u201cOld geezer, is this how your Yu Family behaves as a guest? Acting in such a high and mighty manner in the master\u2019s place? Don\u2019t you know that you look as though you are trying to usurp the place of the master? Hmm? Aren\u2019t you afraid of becoming a joke in the world? As for this Miss\u2019s position in the Ling Family, is that something for you to inquire about? Since I say that I can make the decisions, it means that I can make the decisions! What do you have to doubt? Do you have an ulterior motive? Look at how old you are already and you still have the cheek to inquire about a little girl? Darn old fogey! With such a large beard on your face, aren\u2019t you embarrassed in the slightest?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026you\u2026you\u2026\u201d That old man\u2019s face cramped up as he pointed at Li Xue with his finger trembling. All of a sudden, his eyes turned white and he actually fainted on the chair from his anger.</p><br/><p>The few from the Yu Family who came to the Ling Family were all elders of the Yu Family. They usually acted in a high and mighty manner in the family and their word was law. Who would dare to retort them in the Yu Family or anywhere else? How would the elder know that the lady in front of him would be so unreasonable? He was originally ferociously questioning Li Xue for her crimes but ended up being retorted by Li Xue to the point he was turned into a shameless old man. However, the lady in front of him was a young peerless beauty and with his status, he couldn\u2019t scold or beat her up. His anger could only be pent up in his heart as he fainted from anger.</p><br/><p>Miss Li Xue was probably the first person to anger a XianTian expert to the point he fainted from anger.</p><br/><p>Yu XiaoRan was also angered to the point his limbs were trembling as he glared at Li Xue. He stuttered for a long while but was unable to say a single word.</p><br/><p>Li Xue glared at him with her anger finally vented, \u201cYou are still glaring at this young miss? You\u2019re truly a bunch of old fogies. Or is this the true colors of the Yu Family Elders? Do all of you think that this miss is extremely free? I shall not be accompanying all of you any longer!\u201d She then stood up and walked out without the intention of turning back.</p><br/><p>Peng! Yu XiaoRan sat down and the armchair collapsed. He was indeed a XianTian expert who could shatter a chair made of sandalwood by just sitting down!</p><br/><p>\u201cPavillion Head, the Ling Family is going too far! A lass actually dared to humiliate us as such. We must report this to the family head when we get back and wash away our humiliation today!\u201d another elder cursed angrily.</p><br/><p>This old man truly thought too highly of himself. In the world today, there were probably only a few who were worthy of being humiliated by Miss Li Xue. In the Yu Family, Yu ManLou and Yu ManTang were probably the only two with such right. However, he actually thought that Li Xue came here just to humiliate them! He was truly too arrogant!</p><br/><p>Letting out a soft groan, the elder who was angered by Li Xue to the point he fainted woke up gradually. Before he opened his eyes, he grunted, \u201cThis old man will truly be angered to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>The six elders then discussed with a fervent rage about how the actions of the Ling Family truly went too far!</p><br/><p>A cold snort then sounded from the doorstep and this single snort made the six of them feel a huge pressure bearing on them. At the same time, the temperature in the room went down by a few degrees. This chilliness of this cold snort seemed to have chilled them all to the depths of their soul. Everyone felt as though they were standing naked on a freezing ice mountain.</p><br/><p>Expert! A peerless expert!</p><br/><p>Was it Ling Tian who arrived?</p><br/><p>The six of them were stunned as they looked towards the door.</p><br/><p>By the door, there was a white-robed teen. For the teen to wear white robes in this snowy weather, he looked as though he had become one with the drifting snow. His face was lean and his eyes were like lightning. His face was chilly to the point a layer of ice could probably be scraped off it. Standing in front of the door, he glared at the six Yu Family elders coldly and was obviously in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>The faces of the six elders turned red. After all, it was a shameful thing for someone to hear them cursing people behind their back. Furthermore, the one who overheard them was the one who they were cursing. At the same time, they grumbled to themselves in their hearts, Did someone die at home? Why is everyone wearing white?</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the white-robed teen took a step forward and walked in.</p><br/><p>Yu XiaoRan forced a smile and cupped his fists. \u201cMay I ask if Sir is young noble Ling Tian?\u201d</p><br/><p>The white-robed teen rolled his eyes and sized up Yu XiaoRan before asking with a mighty tone, \u201cYou are Yu XiaoRan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu XiaoRan had the sudden urge to sink his fists into the chilly face of this young teen!</p><br/><p>What is this nonsense! Why does everyone from the Ling Family act in such a manner? Even the Yu Family Head, Yu ManLou would never talk to me this way!</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked you something. Didn\u2019t you hear me?\u201d the white-robed teen took two steps forward and rolled his eyes, \u201cAre you deaf? Have your five senses dulled with age?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The six elders trembled from anger yet again.</p><br/><p>In fact, they should actually feel proud. Even in the Ling Family, there were extremely few people that this white-robed teen would initiate a conversation with.</p><br/><p>One of the elder could no longer hold in his anger and stepped forward with rage, \u201cHow rude! Even if our families are currently enemies with each other, we came from afar without evil intentions or the intention to battle. What is the meaning of humiliating us time and time again? Even if you are the husband of our little princess, you do not have the right to be so rude!\u201d He paused for a moment and shouted, \u201cYour Ling Family has to give us an answer for the matter today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn answer?\u201d The white-robed teen sneered before walking forward to the master\u2019s seat. \u201cWhat kind of an answer do you want? Why don\u2019t you guys ask yourselves what kind of an intention your Yu Family has? You guys had better not feign ignorance. Even if all of you feign ignorance, the world is extremely clear on all your doings. Your Yu Family first made use of Young Madam to try and seize our Ling Family but failed. Then, you guys instructed the Lei Family to ambush us. Now you actually still have the cheek to receive Young Madam back to fight for your Yu Family? I am truly curious if your Yu Family even knows what justice is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Madam?! You\u2026 you aren\u2019t Ling Tian?\u201d The six elders looked at each other with shock. They were shocked that there was actually another young expert apart from Ling Tian in the Ling Family. This truth was truly baffling!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Young Noble someone who you guys can see as you wish? Who do you guys think you are?\u201d The white-robed teen looked at them with disdain and annoyance in his eyes.</p><br/><p>If these words were said by Ling Tian, with Ling Tian having the same status as Yu ManLou currently, they would just swallow the humiliation and treat it as part of their mission. However, the one in front of them was not Ling Tian and he actually dared to humiliate them this way. This filled Yu XiaoRan with a sense of humiliation that he had never felt for close to twenty years. This immense sense of humiliation had almost driven him mad.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, who are you?\u201d Yu XiaoRan controlled his trembling voice and asked with killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Ling Jian.\u201d Ling Jian looked at him with interest, \u201cHave you heard of my name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Jian\u2026\u201d Yu XiaoRan searched for that name in his head before shaking his head, \u201cI haven\u2019t heard of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, there weren\u2019t many in the Ling Family Courtyard who knew about Ling Jian. Apart from the upper echelons of the Courtyard, no one else knew about his existence. Even in the Yu Family, the information they had on Ling Jian was also extremely simple. Ling Jian was just a study attendant who had accompanied Ling Tian since he was young. Someone with a status like Yu XiaoRan would naturally not be concerned about a little study attendant. If not for Ling Jian\u2019s stunning aura, the six of them would not notice him either.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that Yu XiaoRan did not know that this study attendant had another identity that was enough to scare them all to death!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian flew into a huge rage. \u201cI, Ling Jian, am famous all over the world and who wouldn\u2019t know my name? You actually dare to say that you have never heard of me before? This is the greatest insult to me! Old fogey! You actually dare to insult me as such?! I will not let this matter rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s words weren\u2019t wrong or exaggerated at all. The name of the First Pavilion Head was truly world famous and there wasn\u2019t a person in the world who didn\u2019t know of him. However, the name Ling Jian\u2026 there really weren\u2019t many who knew of that name. If Yu XiaoRan was not familiar with the information of the Ling Family, he wouldn\u2019t know who Ling Jian was. Thus, Ling Jian made use of this to fly into a rage. He had also racked his head to come up with this reason, even if it was a little ridiculous.</p><br/><p>Yu XiaoRan was enraged. Ever since his arrival, he was treated coldly by the Ling Family time and time again. He was first humiliated by the white-dressed lady who came out of nowhere and before he could vent his anger, the white-dressed lady disappeared without a trace. Just when he was still in a state of extreme frustration, another unknown character actually dared to come out and humiliate him. On top of that, he had actually said that it was an insult for his name not to be known? He actually dared to say that he would never let the matter rest?</p><br/><p>You can find a few others to ask if they know who Ling Jian is?! Do you think anyone would know who you are?! However, this old man knows about you. Aren\u2019t you the study attendant of that little thief Ling Tian?! What a noble status!</p><br/><p>He was angered to the point he burst out into laughter, \u201cWhy? A servant of the Ling Residence is going to teach us a lesson?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

What exactly happened, to have this great malicious star personally come out? What they could confirm was that since it was Tian ZhiYi that came, then the troops that they brought to Rocky Pier would be insufficient!</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng\u2019s expression was heavy as he spoke, \u201cSo it turns out that the one who calls the shots is here. I apologize for my lack of respect. Shui ManCheng of the Shui Family has embarrassed himself.\u201d The moment he finished speaking, he passed down the command to allow the groups to give way. At the same time, he signaled to an aide close to him, with the intention of asking him to report this matter to their family.</p><br/><p>The army shifted towards the two sides like the tide receding, revealing a wide road of about fifty feet wide. The dull hoof beats of the warhorses sounded as three people seated side by side leisurely made their way over.</p><br/><p>The person in the center was tall and sturdy, as though he was a god. On his face was a golden mask, and when the rays of light shone down, it reflected the light everywhere, causing everyone to not dare to stare at him.</p><br/><p>On his left was someone wearing a silver mask, his body not moving a single inch despite being on the horse, while to his right, the person wore a copper mask with a ferocious expression.</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng\u2019s face turned pale white as an unbelievable thought ran past his head. How could it be that the top three figures of the Sky Alliance had come today? If it was really them, then what would their motive be? This was hard to believe!</p><br/><p>When the golden-masked man, Tian ZhiYi turned to face him, everyone scrambled out of the way, only leaving Shui ManCheng as he stood in the center all alone. He mustered his courage to cup his fists as he politely asked, \u201cYou must be the great mister Tian? Might I know the identities of the other two?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one is Tian ZhiEr!\u201d The silver-masked man cupped his hand, yet did not get down the horse, his voice harsh and grating.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one is Tian ZhiSi!\u201d There seemed to be a smiling intention behind the voice of the copper mask, and the speaker seemed to be genuinely friendly at least.</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng\u2019s expression changed at this time, as his voice trembled, \u201cIt is indeed the three of you great misters. Shui ManCheng from the Shui Family actually had failed to entertain angels unawares, to fail to recognize such famous people.\u201d However, deep inside his heart, he felt fear. For these three to come over and survey the area, just what sort of matter was it that required the three of them to combine forces in order to accomplish their task?</p><br/><p>The more Shui ManCheng thought about it, the more scared he became. The only person here that could possibly even force the three of them to come over would only be\u2026 me! Could it be that they came here to silence me? After thinking of this his face had already turned pale.</p><br/><p>Standing by the side HuangFu Jun evidently came to the same conclusion, and a look of schadenfreude flashed across his eyes. He suddenly took a step forward and kneeled on the ground as he exclaimed, \u201cThis one comes from the HuangFu Family and is named Jun. I pay my respects to the three great figures! Your names and reputations have traveled far and wide, shaking the heavens and earth. To have the fortune of meeting your imposing bearings today, it is indeed a wish of a lifetime!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuangFu Jun?\u201d The man in copper mask repeated the name slowly, before a hint of a smiling intent appeared in his eyes, \u201cYou must be a descendant of the HuangFu aristocratic family. That\u2019s right, the current young master of the HuangFu family goes by this name too. How did you end up here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how the other party was actually aware of his hand, as well as the goodwill he showed, HuangFu Jun inwardly exclaimed with joy. However, his attitude remained respectfully as he replied, \u201cIt is indeed I, and having such great figures recognizing me really fills me with pride and honor. My purpose of coming here today is actually to escort Miss Shui.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShui QianRou, Miss Shui?\u201d The eyes inside the copper mask shone, even as he smilingly replied, \u201cThe HuangFu Family members are all mighty and imposing characters, so how could I not know of them?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThirdie, don\u2019t be so corny. You\u2019re making me have goosebumps.\u201d The eyes of the silver-masked man showed some dissatisfaction as he coldly replied.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, there were light flapping sounds, as three messenger pigeons flew up from behind the Shui Family.</p><br/><p>The golden-masked man gave out a cold snort, and behind him, a man stood on horseback from within the Sky Alliance\u2019s troops. Nocking his arrows and pulling on the bow, three long arrows shot out at practically the same time, and the three messenger pigeons uniformly dropped from the sky as well.</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng\u2019s face turned pale as death!</p><br/><p>The silver-masked man, Tian ZhiEr let out a weird laugh as he gazed at Shui ManCheng, coldly remarking, \u201cThird Master Shui, you don\u2019t have to be too anxious. Our motive here does not involve you. We will stay in our own lane and mind our own business. It\u2019s just that we do not wish for others to know of our presence here. But if Third Master Shui does not know how to keep his birds in check, then it is unknown where the arrows will end up next.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely! Just now, my men were careless and alarmed the three of you. I beg your pardon for that\u2026\u201d Shui ManCheng\u2019s heart also settled. While Tian ZhiEr\u2019s words were grating to the ear, he had revealed the crucial point. They had their own matters to solve by coming here, and it was because they did not wish to be interrupted while doing so that they chose not to let anyone know of their presence! So long as they were not coming for him, then there was not much need to care. Upon coming to this conclusion, the Third Master Shui felt his shoulders relax and had a euphoric feeling as though he had been dragged to heaven from hell.</p><br/><p>From start to the end, the copper-masked man had been staring at HuangFu Jun, with a strange posture.</p><br/><p>\u201cThirdie, what are you looking at?\u201d The man with the gold mask, Tian ZhiYi spoke in a low tone, curious.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat brat is the first in line for succession at the HuangFu aristocratic family. He\u2019s called HuangFu Jun.\u201d Tian ZhiSi made a knowing gesture towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting? How interesting is that?\u201d The gold-masked man snorted through his nose. \u201cThirdie, this person is just a mere HuangFu family member. How is it interesting to look at someone with just this much of ability? I feel you\u2019re slipping backward as time passes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA mere HuangFu aristocratic noble isn\u2019t anything fun\u2026\u201d Tian ZhiSi let out a weird laugh before continuing, \u201cBut this young noble HuangFu actually came all the way here just to welcome the little princess Shui QianRou. From what I heard, this person is totally infatuated with Miss Shui, and Shui ManKong even has intentions to betroth his daughter to him. Do you think\u2026 there\u2019s going to be a good show to watch later on?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 hahahahaha\u2026. in that case, things should get pretty interesting.\u201d Tian ZhiYi also burst out into laughter, his eyes immediately turning towards HuangFu Jun, as though he had seen a valuable artifact. \u201cSince the Young noble HuangFu is present, then no matter what, things are bound to get interesting, really interesting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that Young Noble HuangFu were to perform some kind of emotional play right here and then, and our Young Noble is informed of it, things would get EVEN BETTER. What do you guys think?\u201d Standing by the side eavesdropping, Tian ZhiEr suddenly blurted out while in deep thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Noble will definitely catch wind of this, and I can also roughly estimate his reaction. The entire process will be amusing at the very least.\u201d Tian ZhiYi let out an unbridled laugh, \u201cOur young noble is extremely harsh and severe when it comes to this particular area. If one really angers him, then I guess the Song Family can laugh their way up the ranks. The only problem left\u2026 is that since we did not help the young noble to \u2018clear the path\u2019 beforehand, do you think the young noble will punish us for not doing a good job?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Song Family was the aristocratic family that was ranked directly behind the HuangFus. To say such a thing, the hidden intention behind it was really obvious\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHe definitely won\u2019t. How could Young Noble be such a petty person? Besides, the great Miss Shui could be said to be the belle of this area. Even if we wished to clean the path for young noble, we might not even manage to clear them all! From my sources, another of her diehard pursuers is the Second Young Master of the Song Family, and he has already wooed Miss Shui for a few years. Coupled with this young noble HuangFu, they are akin to fellow sufferers who can empathize with each other.\u201d Tian ZhiSi stroked his chin as he replied in schadenfreude.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat astute eyesight they have!\u201d Tian ZhiEr could not help but praise. \u201cTo be able to see where danger lies and leap towards it. It could be said that their eyesight is indeed the best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really pity the HuangFu Family, to have actually given birth to such a malignant star for a grandson that could potentially destroy the entire family.\u201d Tian ZhiYi sighed as he shook his head. As though that was not enough to describe the magnitude, he sighed once again, \u201cThe pitiful Song Family too, to have given birth to such a sentimental fool.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them burst out into laughter, pleased as punch.</p><br/><p>Their laughing was, however, going a little overboard, and everyone stared at them, unable to make out heads or tails as to what they meant!</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng and HuangFu Jun exchanged looks simultaneously, wondering why the three leaders of the Sky Alliance had suddenly burst into laughter like complete lunatics. HuangFu Jun even noticed them sizing him up as they laughed, and mistakenly thought that they were expressing goodwill towards him. He nodded his head from afar to signal his goodwill happily, thinking deep in his heart that he had probably caught the eye of the three leaders. If they were able to support and aid him, the status of the HuangFu aristocratic family would then rise up by another notch, and this might even allow him to obtain the hand of the little princess he was wooing!</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, big bro, do you think that Heavenly Wind is going to welcome a period of excitement and liveliness, now that the young noble is coming over?\u201d Tian ZhiEr seemed to be a little nervous but at the same time expectant.</p><br/><p>The person who replied him was surprising Tian ZhiSi instead, \u201cStill need to think? I\u2019m already seeing the scene of corpses strewn all over the Heavenly Wind Continent, blood flowing like rivers, and bones piled up like mountains!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian ZhiYi and Tian ZhiEr immediately let out expressions of shock, \u201cSuch a tragic scenario? Why are we unaware of such a matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian ZhiSi snorted as he looked down in disdain at his two elder brothers. His voice turned hoarse as he continued, \u201cYou guys should also know that on this journey, his aide is not Sister Chen, but rather Jian\u2019ge? If it was just to explore and sightsee, why would he bring along this butcher who has the most blood on his hands? Since he has come, you guys should be aware of exactly what will happen when he\u2019s around!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other two immediately let out an involuntary shiver, looking to their left and right, before Tian ZhiEr warned with some lingering fear. \u201cDammit, Thirdie, it\u2019s good that you know it, but do you have to go around and spread it out? If you want to speak, at least be more discreet! If Jian\u2019ge were to hear this phrase, then the three of us would have been ruined by you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian ZhiSi let out a faint smile. \u201cThat definitely will not happen. At the most, if Jian\u2019ge hears it, only the two of you will be punished!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that so?\u201d The two of them could not wrap their minds around it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019ll let Jian\u2019ge know that this sentence was spoken by you. Didn\u2019t you two notice that when I spoke just now, the tone was exactly like yours? As for me, I will be the righteous one that will reprimand you two for saying such words, and maybe Jian\u2019ge will even impart to me some sword tactics to reward me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou good-for-nothing, your son will definitely not have an anus when he\u2019s born!\u201d Tian ZhiEr got into a fury, grabbing hold of his neck and shaking thoroughly. \u201cSee what I can do to you, little brat!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian ZhiSi was shaken so hard that his eyes rolled all over the place, screaming for mercy all the way. Standing by the side, Tian ZhiYi had zero intentions to help, instead watching a good show.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the crowd by the shore started to move, and some people lowly spoke, \u201cThey\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them instantly sobered up and stood on the backs of their horses as they gazed towards the sea. On the horizon, one could see three black dots the size of beans, and following the passage of time, they slowly grew bigger and bigger. They were currently the size of goose eggs.</p><br/><p>The three Tian brothers were brimming with excitement! This literally felt like a lifetime ago. How many years had it been? They were about to meet their savior, the person which they held the firmest of beliefs towards!</p><br/><p>On the shore, Shui ManCheng\u2019s eyes let out sparks of hatred as he clenched his fists under the robe. He muttered to himself, \u201cYou guys are back, yet my son, my only son is doomed to wander on the other side for eternity! Shui QianRou, there\u2019s no way for you to dismiss this just like that! I will definitely not forgive you!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

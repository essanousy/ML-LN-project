After all, it was still acceptable for Ling Tian to have a sudden enlightenment.</p><br/><p>However, for ten people to have a sudden enlightenment together\u2026 wasn\u2019t this too puzzling? Unless the ten of them consumed a large amount of heavenly treasure at the same time. However, could such a large amount of heavenly treasure possibly exist? Could they have enough to provide for a full ten people? This was too unbelievable!</p><br/><p>While Justice was extremely knowledgeable and had guessed the truth, this truth was far too astounding. Even in Justice\u2019s experience, it was unbelievable! After all, Ling Tian\u2019s luck truly went against the heavens. For him to casually take out the inner pellet of the legendary flood dragon, was this something that an ordinary person could do?</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019ge, you\u2026 you successfully broke through into the twelfth level?\u201d Li Xue\u2019s voice trembled and she was filled with disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe twelfth level? Are you mad?\u201d Ling Tian originally wanted to show off to her and was immediately choked by Li Xue\u2019s words. He coughed twice awkwardly and said, \u201cI only broke through a bottleneck that I faced in the eleventh level. This is already a huge blessing. Don\u2019t you know that from the seventh level onward, every additional level would grant me twice the energy? From the tenth level onward, the difference between the two levels can\u2019t even be measured! How would it be possible for someone to fly from the eleventh to twelfth level so easily? Do you think that this is a fairytale? Do you want to anger me to death?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh! How useless, you are still at the eleventh level.\u201d Li Xue snorted as though she looked down on Ling Tian with disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 this lass!\u201d In a fit of rage, Ling Tian grabbed Li Xue over and gave her a good spanking on her round ass.</p><br/><p>\u201cAHH!\u201d Li Xue was caught off guard and suddenly felt a powerful force dragging her over before a burning feeling on her ass. She could not help but grab onto her ass as she jumped away with her face completely red.</p><br/><p>Everyone burst out laughing and Ling Chi and his others actually dared to let out a wolf-whistle and wink at Ling Tian. They definitely looked even worse than lechers.</p><br/><p>If the two of them were alone, Li Xue wouldn\u2019t really mind if Ling Tian performed such actions. However, they were currently in front of everybody! Li Xue was both embarrassed and angry as she pounced towards Ling Tian while brandishing her \u2018claws\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep quiet\u2026. look, the crucial time is here.\u201d Ling Tian pointed towards the plaza.</p><br/><p>Ling Feng, Ling Yun, Ling Lei, and Ling Dian were currently sparring with each other so that they could stabilize their foundations.</p><br/><p>Ever since they left their seclusion they sparred against each other without stopping.</p><br/><p>Under the guidance of Ling Tian, Ling Jian, Ling Chen, and Li Xue, the martial arts of the little brats had increased quickly. In just a short period of time, they were able to regain control of the rapid increase in their inner qi. With the four of them engaging in an intense sparring match, everyone else could only see their figures flashing around in the plaza.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d Ling Tian shouted out before looking at Ling Tian with a smile, \u201cBrother Justice, what do you think about my little brothers?\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice sat on an armchair and said, \u201cThese little ones have a good foundation but they are still lacking practice.\u201d The moment Feng, Yun, Lei, and Dian heard that they all shrunk back in fear. The one who they respected the most was Ling Tian, and relied on the most was Ling Jian, but the one who they feared the most was Justice who was before them!</p><br/><p>This fellow was really a little too perverse. Despite being the number one expert in the world, he was also the number one medical saint in the world. After treating the injuries of the four little brats, he began to train them up. However, his training method wasn\u2019t an orthodox one and his actions were extremely vicious. He would always spank them on the ass which was the place where it would hurt martial arts practitioners the most. Every time the four of them saw Justice, they would want to faint on the spot. Of course, the four of their martial arts did improve greatly as well, especially their movement techniques. If their previous movement technique was breaking through from the realm of the mortals to the deities, their current movement technique was like the deities painting! However, even with their improved movement technique, Justice could toy with them as he wished. While they did want to put their life on the line to fight Justice, Justice\u2019s martial arts was just too far above theirs and it was no different from them seeking abuse.</p><br/><p>Thus, whenever these brats saw Justice, they would want to turn tail and run. If not for their strength making a huge advancement and Ling Tian giving them strict orders, they would definitely not appear today!</p><br/><p>Justice continued, \u201cAs for the other two brats, they are naturally better. Of course, there is still room for improvement.\u201d Justice then pointed at Ling Jian and Ling Chi, looking as though he was full of regret that Ling Chi escaped from his palms because of his little girlfriend Die\u2019er.</p><br/><p>While Justice seemed as though he was filled with disdain in his words, he was actually extremely shaken on the inside. Of the ten men and three ladies before him, they were all either suave young gentlemen or peerless beauties! Their talents were impressive and their foundation was strong. However, this wasn\u2019t enough to shake Justice. What made him the most shocked was the fact that apart from Li Xue and Ling Tian, the other eleven had their own strong suite and something unique about themselves! Furthermore, all eleven of them were singlehandedly trained by Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>A single master was able to teach eleven disciples with different styles! Furthermore, they were all experts!</p><br/><p>Based on Justice\u2019s experience, this was definitely extremely rare!</p><br/><p>If a master had tens or hundreds of disciples who were all experts, Justice wouldn\u2019t be surprised. But if a master was able to teach ten disciples who had completely different styles, this was something that was extremely challenging.</p><br/><p>Even if Justice tried to nurture a bunch of disciples, with his vast martial arts knowledge he would naturally be able to train them all differently. However, it was inevitable for all of his disciples to have a shadow of his martial arts and it would be impossible for them to be so different.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian had actually accomplished such a feat. Such a feat was right before Justice\u2019s eyes!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was a teen who was less than 20 years old!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled, \u201cLacking practice? Ah ah, may Brother Justice train them for a while?\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice\u2019s eyes glowed and as he looked at the four brats, they felt as though they were completely naked and were completely seen through by Justice. Justice then shook his head and said, \u201cNo. Even if the four of them had some breakthroughs, they wouldn\u2019t be my match even if they joined hands. Besides that, the four of them fear me as though I was a tiger and they no longer have the confidence to challenge me. There wouldn\u2019t be any meaning for them to challenge me. You should also know that I had just made a breakthrough recently and I am not able to control my strength to perfection yet. The moment I take action, their lives may be at stake. It\u2019s best that we forget about it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The recent breakthrough that Justice was talking about was him being inspired by Yu BingYan\u2019s martial arts. These past few days, Justice had already merged this new martial arts knowledge together with his own martial arts.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian frowned. After Ling Tian experienced his recent breakthrough, he was confident that he wouldn\u2019t be defeated by Justice. However, he was shocked to realize that Justice had also achieved a breakthrough as well. While Ling Tian did want to borrow Justice\u2019s strength to raise the strength of Feng, Yun, Lei, and Dian, he definitely didn\u2019t want their lives to be harmed.</p><br/><p>Justice was a martial arts maniac and had his own pride. While he was willing to train the four of them, he wouldn\u2019t feed them moves for sure. If he was willing to do so, he wouldn\u2019t be Justice. Looking at how the four of them was so full of fear when facing Justice, Ling Tian knew that Justice must have tortured the four of them badly when training them previously. As such, Ling Tian had no choice but to give up the thought.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Ling Jian suddenly stood forward and with a cold glare in his eyes, he looked at Justice. At the same time, a boundless sword qi and killing intent also shot out from his body and he said expressionlessly, \u201cMartial Order Medallion owner, let me fight you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt his heart clench up. While Ling Jian had indeed made huge improvements from a month ago, he definitely wasn\u2019t a match for Justice. It was truly a little too early and unwise for Ling Jian to issue Justice a challenge. If Ling Jian lost today, even if Justice showed him mercy and didn\u2019t harm his life, the notion of Justice being undefeatable would still be planted in his heart and it wouldn\u2019t be good for his future progress.</p><br/><p>Looking at Ling Jian\u2019s resolute appearance, Ling Tian hesitated for a moment but did not stop Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian didn\u2019t want to spar with Justice but wanted to challenge Justice! He wanted to challenge Justice with his life as the price! The moment Ling Jian stood forward, he unleashed his boundless aura, chilly killing intent, and unbreakable sword qi!</p><br/><p>Transforming his body into a sword!</p><br/><p>When Ling Jian broke through into the eighth stage of the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula, he also comprehended another technique: transforming his body into a sword! This was also the reason why he had the confidence to challenge Justice!</p><br/><p>Justice\u2019s eyes narrowed and as he looked at Ling Jian, he didn\u2019t make a single move but he seemed to have been transformed into a gigantic mountain crushing down towards Ling Jian!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say anything and didn\u2019t make a move. However, he unleashed his boundless aura to retaliate against Ling Jian\u2019s aura!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian waved his sleeves and drifted back eighty feet. He did not wish to and could not interfere in the battle between the two of them. This was also where Ling Tian was wise. If he didn\u2019t interfere, with Justice\u2019s strength being far above Ling Jian, Justice would be able to show mercy. If he interfered in their battle at this moment, Justice would definitely have to use his full strength to deal with them and while he would be fine, Ling Jian would face certain death!</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t be helping Ling Jian but killing him!</p><br/><p>The instant Ling Tian backed away, a strange transformation happened between Ling Jian and Justice. Both of them did not make a single move but in the eyes of the others, it was as though the space between the both of them had been warped.</p><br/><p>A short while later, Ling Jian took a step back and his eagle eyes were locked onto Justice. \u201cAdmiration! Thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice turned around and seemed to be pondering for a moment before saying, \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. While your strength can\u2019t be compared to the Ling Tian of half a year ago, you already have the rights to challenge me. Of course, I mean in the future! I am truly willing to wait for such an opponent. I will be waiting for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>A smile could be seen on Ling Jian\u2019s frosty face and he did not say another word. He turned around and stood behind Ling Tian without saying a thing.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian frowned and roared, \u201cSpit it out!\u201d He used a commanding tone that did not allow Ling Jian to defy him.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face turned red and the moment he opened his mouth, an arrow of blood was shot onto the ground. The arrow of blood was actually able to create a deep hole in the ground! After panting for a short moment, Ling Jian returned to normal.</p></div>\n</div>"}

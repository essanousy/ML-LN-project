For someone who was used to looking down on people in disdain, with a proud and arrogant attitude, this period of time was nothing less than a nightmare. She had put forth her heart and soul in order to fight for her family, even to the point of forsaking her own personal feelings, but all she received in exchange was the merciless abandonment of her family, even to the point of falling into their despicable traps. This caused her insistence towards her family to finally slacken.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, with someone like Yu BingYan as a clear cut example for her, Shui QianRou\u2019s stand was even more swayed. Every time when she saw how Yu BingYan would unhesitatingly declare her love for Ling Tian, that smitten expression she had would always cause Shui QianRou to feel envious for her. Both of them were similar women from aristocratic families, and they were even supposed to be opponents for the generational battle, so why was it that Yu BingYan could chase after her own happiness but not herself?</p><br/><p>To a woman, was power and influence really that important? The crucial point was still having a partner who could understand her properly to accompany her for the rest of her life. If she could not be together with the one she loved, then even if she climbed to the highest peak of the world, what use was it? Even if she could make the Shui Family into the world\u2019s top aristocratic family, where would be the bliss and joy in that?</p><br/><p>As such, Shui QianRou was at a loss for what to do now. However, while she was perplexed, Ling Tian had actually instructed the Ling Family to create opportunities for her, slowly step by step fulfilling her aspirations in the Shui Family. This made Shui QianRou feel that the reason why Ling Tian was doing all of this was to allow her to compensate for the Shui Family. This filled her with much bliss, but deep inside her heart, she knew that once the matter in Heavenly Star came to an end, Ling Tian would not stop his ambitions of expansion no matter who was the person persuading him. At that time, she should return to Heavenly Star to obtain her birthright. Only then could she actually help the one she loved.</p><br/><p>The constraints of time, in contrast, allowed Shui QianRou to make the final choice to chase after her own happiness. She was no longer ever fearful and nervous, especially towards the last few days of brutal deaths and murder. Ling Tian and Shui QianRou all were severely wounded, which made her feel that life was too precious and short. At any time, a person could just close their eyes forever, and such a frightening realization was a factor that made her choose to walk down her own path.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou did not wish to still keep all the matters in her heart even when she died, without anyone knowing or hearing of it. This was especially in regards to letting Ling Tian know that she was attracted to him. If she did not tell him anything before she died, then that would be a regret she would carry to her grave.</p><br/><p>Even if she could only obtain a year or even a day of bliss, that was enough. This was the mentality Shui QianRou had currently.</p><br/><p>As such, she revealed all that was inside her heart towards Ling Tian today without the slightest hesitation. Ling Tian\u2019s response was considered to be within her expectations, yet not at the same time, because she herself was aware that Ling Tian was not totally callous about her. At least, he thought of her in a positive light. This was also another driving factor giving her the courage to confess her feelings.</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian\u2019s reply was vague, Shui QianRou already understood what he was trying to imply.</p><br/><p>At this point, she wanted to cry, to cry out in blissful happiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the near future, when the matters here have calmed down, you should also return to Heavenly Wind Continent to start the operations. Just passively countering their every move cannot go on forever, as your situation will get worse. If you wish to win, then you need to take the initiative. Only then will you stand the chance of overthrowing them. If those at the sides manage to score some good results during the generational battle, then there will not be any hope left for you to reverse the situation.\u201d Ling Tian let out an indifferent smile as he walked away, seeming to randomly drop this remark.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou felt her heart sink as a sour feeling filled her nose. Has it finally come to this?</p><br/><p>To leave Heavenly Star Continent, to leave this place where she could sleep in peace every night\u2026.. to return to that nightmare of a place where deceit and treachery lay abundant, to continue with a life of plotting and scheming? Then\u2026. when can this stop? When will we ever meet?! Shui QianRou was filled with melancholy. And a dull throbbing pain could be felt in her heart. She lowered down her head, tightly biting on her cherry lips, while her feet involuntarily drew circles on the floor. But she did not speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will not feel lonely, because I\u2019ll be accompanying you there.\u201d Ling Tian laughed and continued, \u201cI\u2019ve dreamed of seeing the scenery of the Heavenly Wind Continent for a long time already. I\u2019m also pretty interested in the heroic legends behind Mount Vacant Sky. Can you feel at ease now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? You\u2019re really intending to go over there?\u201d Shui QianRou lifted up her head as undisguised joy shone through her eyes. The joys and sorrows of life come too quickly, one moment she was submerged in hell, but the next she was lifted back up to heaven. A brilliant smile was already suffused on her face as she spoke. So long as \u2018he\u2019 remained by her side, where on earth could she go and not feel happy?</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Why is it that you\u2019ve started crying? Do you hate me that much, If so, then forget it. Since you don\u2019t wish to see me, then I had better not go over there. I don\u2019t need to bring disdain upon myself!\u201d Ling Tian pretended to sigh as he turned to walk out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, you must go!\u201d Shui QianRou pounced over like a fish jumping out of the water, hugging him. It was like an octopus had latched onto him, and she laughed as she shouted out, \u201cYou obviously said that you would go, so you can\u2019t go back on your word. You must go, you better go\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Never in his dreams did he imagine that Shui QianRou would have such an intense reaction, and Ling Tian was struck full on by the waves of fragrance that rushed towards him. A soft and warm body that was filled with countless temptations suddenly clung onto him, with the feeling of satiny soft skin all around him. Shui QianRou\u2019s proud twin peaks were pressed tightly on his chest. The thin fabric of her robes did nothing to mask the sensitive senses of Ling Tian, and he could acutely feel two little dots that were the size of beans lightly grazing his chest\u2026</p><br/><p>This lass actually did not bother wearing any undergarments!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt as though a ball of fire had been lit up under his heart. Looking at the scene of spring in front of him, carrying an infinite amount of happiness, as well as the satisfied smile on her face causing her cherry-red lips to curve into a crescent, Ling Tian\u2019s body blazed up with an evil fire. He could not help but lower his head down, quickly sealing that perfect little mouth with his.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou had previously lost herself in her emotions, and within this short instant she suddenly felt that she had acted too rashly, without a single trace of a graceful bearing. She was afraid that her position in his eyes would be lowered and was just about to come down when her vision went dark, and she realized that her lips had already been claimed by Ling Tian\u2026</p><br/><p>Her brain short-circuited instantly with a \u2018boom\u2019, leaving a patch of white. Her eyes widened into perfect circles, staring into Ling Tian who was impossibly close to her, revealing an expression of embarrassment as well as helplessness.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this what she had always dreamed of? But\u2026 why was the feeling so strange? Her heart was in a panic, yet she was filled with so much sweetness and bliss. This hug, how could it suddenly feel so safe to her?</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou only felt her lips being wrapped in warmth, but shortly after, a lively tongue started to tease the edges of her lips, before suddenly prying open her teeth and burrowing in\u2026</p><br/><p>An immediate sensation of losing one\u2019s soul and melting rose from Shui QianRou\u2019s heart. She tentatively opened her mouth, accepting the advances of the man before her. It was only after a long time that she suddenly recovered from her senses, and wanted to open her mouth wide to scream out. But who knew that the moment her mouth opened up wide, her tongue was immediately latched onto by the offensive party. Shui QianRou\u2019s body quivered and her brain grew all foggy once again. She could only resign herself to hold on to Ling Tian for dear life, without any power to struggle. Her eyes were trained onto him, curiously yet shyly watching his face.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou only felt as though her body was incredibly weak, without even the strength to hold onto Ling Tian any longer. Just as she was about to drop off, she felt a warmth on her pert behind. It turned out that a pair of blazing hot hands had all of a sudden appeared on her, slightly exerting strength as they supported her. But these pair of hands were extremely perverted, actually taking the chance to slide further in and start to lightly knead at her secret spots\u2026</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou could only open her eyes wide, yet could not do anything against Ling Tian\u2019s frenzied tongue action. She actually could not react to his advances, or it should be said that she had no idea how to react to him\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ling Tian lifted up his head, breaking the kiss as he panted heavily. He looked deeply into her eyes as he reprimanded. \u201cFocus.\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was actually so domineering!</p><br/><p>This arrogant and domineering tone managed to allow Shui QianRou to cut through the fog in her mind. But instead of registering the dominance, she was panicking in her heart as she rapidly thought, \u201cHe wants me to focus? Focus on what?\u201d Thinking up to this point, she only managed to open her mouth and ask this silly question, \u201cWhat\u2026. focus?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat huh\u2026 focus on this.\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s tone had become rougher, and he bent his head once again, sealing up her lips with his\u2026</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou began to feel as though she was short for breath\u2026..</p><br/><p>It was only after a long period of time that Ling Tian finally let go of her, cuddling her in his bosom as he gazed at her shyly nestled within, huffing and panting with tightly shut eyes. He lightly smiled, before blowing into her ear, \u201cHow did it feel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou was immersed in the feeling of having her soul floating about the nine heavens, and had not returned back to earth. Thus she instinctively responded, \u201cWhat feeling?\u201d Moments later, she snapped back into reality, and her face immediately felt as though it was on fire. With a lovable moan, she immediately buried her face into Ling Tian\u2019s chest, not daring to look up.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian evilly grinned before using a hand to smack down on her buttocks before kneading them unceremoniously. Shui QianRou immediately moaned out loud, her body trembling as her eyes grew vacant once more.</p><br/><p>Savoring the texture and feel of softness on his hands, Ling Tian strongly resisted the urge to take her right there and then. He deeply breathed in, before putting her down.</p><br/><p>It was not that he had no desire to, but rather he could not afford to.</p><br/><p>Li Xue, Ling Chen and Yu BingYan were in another room not far from here, and if the three of them got impatient and rushed over, catching them in the act, Ling Tian could have a tough time trying to swallow these three vats of vinegar [1]\u2026</p><br/><p>Furthermore, this was a critical juncture, and it simply was not the time to fool around\u2026</p><br/><p>If he wished to consider their happiness, then he needed to think from a long term perspective, Ling Tian comforted himself inwardly. This caused little Ling Tian who was at full mast to slowly sound the retreat as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to take good care of yourself these few days. We might have to move off at any moment. As for the construction of the Shui Family Courtyard here at Sky Bearing, you can be assured, nothing will go wrong.\u201d Ling Tian lightly tousled her hair as he gently spoke.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou lay on the reclining chair as though she was totally boneless, and could only reply with a soft \u2018en\u2019. She was unlike Ling Tian, who had a \u2018daily exercise regime\u2019 every day. She was still a lady who had yet to be married, thus even the kiss they had previously was her first kiss! She was still enthralled within that feeling of bliss, to the point that her brain was still a little foggy. Whatever Ling Tian said, she would agree, and it was as though she had no brain cells left to think. Or else, with the intelligence of this great Miss Shui, how could she pose such a stupid question just now?</p><br/><p>Looking at Shui QianRou\u2019s lazy look as though she was still immersed within her dreams, Ling Tian felt a sense of happiness, and lightly held on to her as he whispered a few more endearing words before he finally left the room.</p><br/><p>It was a long time after Ling Tian left that Shui QianRou was finally roused from her messy thoughts. As she gradually recalled the bits and pieces that had happened, her face grew redder and hotter, and finally she moaned out loud, burying her head within the pillow as she pulled the blankets over her, as though trying to enclose herself in her own world. Just what was wrong with her today, this was just too embarrassing\u2026.</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian walked out of the room, he sighed towards himself. Regarding the matters in Heavenly Wind Continent, he really did not know how to handle it. There was only less than a year left before the Yu and Shui Families\u2019 sixty-year generational battle! Ling Tian was weighing his options. Would it be better for him to go over to Heavenly Wind Continent before the battle started, or after? Although, the generational battle had already lost its original meaning!</p><br/><p>If he went there before the battle, then relying on the messy situation of the Shui Family currently, he could borrow the strength and influence of the Sky Alliance to further his plans. However, right now the hearts of the Shui Family members were scattered from one another, but their foundations still maintained. If he wished to carry out his plans, then he would have to pay a humongous price to do so, and he wasn\u2019t willing!</p><br/><p>But if he were to head over after the generational battle, while the Shui Family would suffer from a drop in strength, his opponents would definitely obtain an overwhelming advantage in the generational battles and this would usher in a new age of the Shui Family. At that point, not only would their internal strife be solved, but they would also group together and become like a plate of steel. At that point, it would be hard for Ling Tian to succeed in his plan.</p><br/><p>To allow Shui QianRou to rise up was indeed a path of thorns.</p><br/><p>Shaking his head, Ling Tian still could not make up his mind in the end and walked with heavy steps towards the secret chamber. This problem could wait until he had purged the poison from Yu BingYan\u2019s meridians.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow are the preparations?\u201d The moment Ling Tian entered, he spoke in a stern voice, giving the three beauties a scare. They did not know why Ling Tian\u2019s tone would suddenly become so severe.</p><br/><p>How could they know that Ling Tian was doing a preemptive strike in order to hide his \u2018wrongdoings\u2019 earlier?</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no problem at all, we can begin at any time.\u201d Li Xue sized up Ling Tian with a suspicious look. Inside the room, the person who knew Ling Tian best was probably her! She clearly knew that something was up with Ling Tian, but she could not be bothered to expose him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot now,\u201d Ling Tian solemnly replied. \u201cSince you said that preparations are done, then take a look at this to see if we can use it for the purging of the poison. This is good stuff!\u201d As he spoke, his hand flipped over, and within his palm lay a round and smooth orb much like a goose egg. It had a bouncy texture, and a dim light could actually be seen emitting from within it, causing a clean fragrance to appear in the stone chamber.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is an inner pellet? Li Xue\u2019s expression grew solemn as well. She was more experienced than Ling Tian regarding such a thing, to the point that she recognized it at the very first glance. This was indeed an inner pellet! She could not help but jump in shock, as she never realized that there were divine beasts in this world capable of congealing an inner pellet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is indeed an inner pellet, it belongs to a scaled armored dragon, with it mainly comprised of Yang energy.\u201d Ling Tian hefted the pellet and asked, \u201cTake a look and see if you can use it, as well as how you would go about using it. You\u2019re more familiar than me in such matters, and I can only ask for guidance this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScaled Armored Dragon!\u201d Li Xue sucked in a cold breath of air, stretching out her hand to receive it and feeling the quality of the pellet. Her face changed immediately as she exclaimed, \u201cHalf of the pellet has already turned into solid form, this shows a cultivation of at least 2000 years\u2026 This should be a scaled armored dragon on the verge of turning into a true dragon! You\u2026 with your current strength, how could you even kill such a beast? Don\u2019t tell me this was done by you, I won\u2019t believe it, not even Justice could do so a thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could only bitterly smile. He knew that this lass was trying to put him down, hence he rubbed his nose and replied, \u201cIf purely based on results, then you could really say that I killed it, while it was hugely because of luck. Remember how I wanted to cut the river\u2019s flow that one time? In order to do so I had to blow up the entire mountain, and when it collapsed this poor creature was flattened to death, so I got it cheaply. That\u2019s how I conveniently got my hands on this thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cConveniently? What other good stuff do you have? Take it all out!\u201d Li Xue\u2019s eyes lit up and her little hand had already stretched out once more, directly under Ling Tian\u2019s nose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed bitterly.</p><br/><p>It was not that he did not wish to pass things over, but the problem was how to go about doing it. The skin of the scaled armored dragon could be used to manufacture protective vests, and the inner pellet could be given to whoever had the best knowledge of it. But the problem lay in the most precious treasures of the scaled armored dragon, the eyes, which were also known as night illumination pearls! There were only two, but three women here\u2026 whom should he give it to?</p><br/><p>\u201cHand it over!\u201d Seeing Ling Tian with a bitter smile on his face, Ling Chen and Yu BingYan could not help but giggle and exchange glances. Suddenly, two more hands appeared under Ling Tian\u2019s nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh heh, just the inner pellet? For a scaled armored dragon to have cultivated to such a level, its eyes could be considered as the highest grade of night illumination pearls, so where are they? Hurry and hand them out! Why, have you given them to someone else? No wonder you had a shifty look when you came in just now!\u201d Li Xue was akin to a loan shark who had come to collect the debts.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately started sweating, and he dejectedly took out the night illumination pearls that were as large as chicken eggs, stuffing them into Li Xue\u2019s hands as he anxiously replied, \u201cWhat shifty look? I\u2019ll hand these over but there\u2019s only two, so you can choose who to give them to. I have no opinions on this!\u201d The moment he passed her the pearls he immediately relaxed and began laughing out loud.</p><br/><p>When the night illumination pearls were taken out, the entire stone chamber was suddenly shrouded in a faint dusky light, elegant and pristine, as though untainted by mortal dirt. The rays of light let out were just like that of a fantasy world\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWah!\u201d Ling Chen and Yu BingYan immediately exclaimed in joy. Being females, they always had an attraction and thirst for such rare treasures. No matter if they were a lady from an aristocratic family or a daughter of a humble home, neither was an exception, and they were immediately enthralled by the pearls.</p><br/><p>Li Xue was also similarly stunned.</p><br/><p>With her intelligence, she immediately understood that the \u2018rent\u2019 she worked so hard to get had instantly turned into a hot potato in her hands!</p><br/><p>There was only two of them, so how should she divide them? Now that there were three of them, and this was not even counting Xiao YanXue, Shui QianRou, as well as Ling Tian\u2019s cousin back in the Ling Residence\u2026. Li Xue sighed, could it be that she would be forced to divide it using a knife?</p><br/><p>Ling Chen as well as Yu BingYan immediately realized this point and looked at the other party in embarrassment before suddenly taking a step back.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care anymore!\u201d In a panic, Li Xue immediately threw the two pearls back to Ling Tian, as though they were searing hot metal plates.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian hurriedly caught them, a helpless look on his face as he replied, \u201cI already said that I have no opinions, so what do you want me to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>All three ladies suddenly fell into silence. They evidently wanted it, but they did not dare to open their mouths, obviously wanting for Ling Tian to make the final choice. Who would this jerk choose in the end?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian did not know whether to laugh or cry. It was troublesome when one had too many wives. This matter of choosing who to give things to was really too vexing.</p><br/><p>If he were to choose to randomly hand it out, then the rest of them would definitely be saddened. In addition, the girl who received it would be overjoyed but also incredibly anxious, since she would be on the opposite side of the other ladies.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian viciously glared at Li Xue, his meaning clear: See! Playing punk with me, look at the trouble you\u2019ve caused!</p><br/><p>Li Xue guiltily looked away, before suddenly rolling her eyes at him as she lowered her head. In her heart she was sneering, Serves you right, who asked you to be such a womanizer, taking so many concubines? Now look, isn\u2019t this your retribution?\u201d</p><br/><p>The secret chamber fell into a moment of silence such that even a pin dropping could be heard.</p><br/><p>After a while, Ling Tian finally laughed bitterly. \u201cSince we cannot separate them, then how about I just smash them all apart and mix it with water, allowing everyone to drink it? I heard that this thing has beautifying properties, and everyone can get an equal share if it\u2019s ground into powder.\u201d Ling Tian even laughed, but his laugh was extremely forced and sounded more like he was crying out loud than laughing.</p><br/><p>The moment his sentence ended, the three beauties glared at him as though he was a monster. Such a perfect work of nature, a treasured night illumination pearl, and this b*stard actually wanted to smash it?</p><br/><p>The three of them immediately rushed forward, snatching the pearls away from him. After exchanging a glance with each other, Li Xue suddenly coughed and muttered, \u201cRegarding these two pearls, I have an idea.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at her interestedly, \u201cOh, what is it? How do you plan to solve it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese two pearls, while wondrous, only number two in the end. No matter which sister you give it to, it would be very inappropriate. As such, I have two ideas to solve this. The first would be that since these night illumination pearls came from the scaled armored dragon, they have the ability to absorb the surrounding energy of the atmosphere, and other than beautifying effects, it can keep illnesses at bay. That\u2019s the say, so long as one wears the pearl on them, their bodies will gradually improve. Although it is not as heaven-defying as having immortality, they can increase their lifespan by years without a problem. My first suggestion would be to give these two pearls to the two elders of the Ling Family, allowing both of them to wear one each.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s eyes lit up, and could not help but secretly nod his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second idea would be to take these two pearls as family heirlooms of the Ling Family. Since we\u2019re already in the midst of our great plan, and it will not be for long before Tian\u2019ge will sit on the throne, my meaning is to use these pearls as the jewelry when the emperor ascends his throne. The emperor will wear one, and the empress will wear the other.\u201d Li Xue slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe that no matter which idea it is, the pearls would not cause any unnecessary problems. What does everyone think!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth ideas are good, hehe, Sister Xue, you\u2019re really smart!\u201d Both Ling Chen and Yu BingYan praised, fully convinced of Li Xue wits.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then let me pass the pearls over to grandfather and grandmother. The two elders are already getting on in age, and need these pearls more than us.\u201d Ling Tian made the final decision, and could not help but feel a little guilty in his heart. To think that he was still their own grandson, but did not consider them at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, before this, the two pearls can be given to Sister BingYan to wear at her waist, at least for today.\u201d Li Xue spoke after some consideration. \u201cOnce we begin to purge the poison, if she wears this, then it can protect her meridians and prevent them from suffering too much damage. Secondly, the inner pellet of the scaled armored dragon will resonate with the pearls, allowing the medicinal strength to be better absorbed by the body. After treatment, it can also serve as an effective remedy to replenish the vitality in her body. It\u2019s not too late to pass the pearls over to the two elders after she recovers.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian expressed his agreement, before asking, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, I believe you have an idea of how much she will need to consume?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue, on the contrary, shook her head, \u201cHow can there be a prescribed amount? I can only suggest that we start off with the smallest dosage possible, then slowly test out the greatest amount her meridians can take at any one time. When the pure Yang energy fully dissipates, then we\u2019ll stop the dosage and immediately begin the purging. Oh, there\u2019s still another point, Sister BingYan\u2019s conception and governing meridians are not opened yet, and thus only can absorb the liquid portion of the inner pellet. If the medicinal strength is too vigorous, she will not be able to take it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue glanced at Yu BingYan with a smile as she continued, \u201cIf Sister BingYan is ready, then we can start. Now that we have this inner pellet, our chances of success will greatly increase, and I believe it will be easy to dispel this foul disease for good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan\u2019s face immediately turned white, and she backed off two steps like a frightened deer, tightly hugging onto Ling Tian\u2019s right arm as her body trembled.</p><br/><p>Divine Black Negative Meridians, this was the foul disease that had afflicted Yu BingYan for her entire life. It was also regarded as the number one incurable disease, and Yu BingYan had long given up hope to cure it. However, right now, knowing that there was a cure for it, Yu BingYan suddenly became frightened.</p><br/><p>If it was before she met Ling Tian, then she would not be afraid, but rather joyous at such a scenario. Curing it was a good thing, and if it could not be removed, it could be considered as a sort of release to her. Life and death did not matter to her that much during that point.</p><br/><p>However, after she accepted Ling Tian into her heart, Yu BingYan grew afraid. She was not afraid of dying but instead was afraid of leaving Ling Tian, of knowing that he would live his life in misery. She was even more afraid of losing the happiness she had just obtained. Even if it was just to enjoy it for one month more, one day, or even a minute, to use this happiness to gamble against her treatment was not something she was willing to do, even if the chance of success was infinitely close to 100%!</p><br/><p>She blankly stared at Ling Tian, tears beginning to brim in her eyes. But she refused to blink, as she felt that the moment she blinked, she would see less of Ling Tian. Even if she were to die, she wanted to see more of Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>Tears started to silently flow.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly lass, why are you even crying?\u201d Ling Tian gently wiped off the tears in her eyes as he spoke in a gentle tone, \u201cRegarding this treatment, I\u2019ve already prepared this for more than a year. Relax, nothing will go wrong! Believe in me! For a longer period of happiness, we have to overcome this illness of yours together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan continued to stare dumbly at him, her voice trembling as she spoke, \u201cTian\u2019ge, I\u2019m afraid\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ll never get to see you again. How about pushing this back for a few more days? Let me accompany you a few more days, even a day more would be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s heart twisted, yet he forced out a laugh, as though he was completely relaxed as he replied, \u201cWhat are you scared of?! Yan\u2019er, after today, we\u2019ll have a lifetime to spend with each other, growing older and being actual husband and wife. Didn\u2019t you already agree to that? You still promised to bear me children, don\u2019t tell me you aren\u2019t willing anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tears continued to drip down from Yu BingYan\u2019s face, as she choked in between sobs, \u201cI want\u2026 I really want to bear children for you, to grow old together, that\u2019s my greatest wish. But I\u2019m afraid\u2026 I\u2019m really afraid I don\u2019t have this fortune\u2026 what if\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are no ifs!\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s voice suddenly took on a stern tone. \u201cYan\u2019er, you\u2019re mine, Ling Tian\u2019s woman. I need you to properly live on, do you understand? Live on for me! Believe me, and also believe yourself. We will pass through this hurdle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan nodded, sprinkling the ground full of tears. \u201cTian\u2019ge, so long as you promise me something, we can begin right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to promise me that if, IF, if I don\u2019t make it\u2026. and die, you have\u2026. to quickly forget about me. I don\u2019t wish to have you feel sad over me, and even more than that I do not wish for you to miss me, to hurt yourself. You, as well as Sister Ling Chen and Li Xue must live on well without me, okay?\u201d Yu BingYan\u2019s lips trembled, and the tears flowed down unceasingly now.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt a heart-wrenching pain, and the words choked in his throat. He violently hugged Yu BingYan, lowered his head, gently kissing her on her lips, growing fiercer by the second. Yu BingYan\u2019s body trembled, and her elegant arms circled around Ling Tian\u2019s neck, tightly holding on while choking and sobbing sounds still sounded from her.</p><br/><p>The tears never once stopped flowing down her face, flowing down to where their mouths were intertwined. Ling Tian could clearly feel a faint salty and bitter taste\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and Li Xue were looking on by the side, but they actually had no jealousy in their hearts, but rather a sense of tenderness and pity towards Yu BingYan\u2026</p><br/><p>[1]: The Chinese slang for being jealous () sounds like vinegar.</p></div>\n</div>"}

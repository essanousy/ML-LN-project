Are you getting pleasure from seeing a naked guy? If you are done watching, quickly come and help me! Are you really that happy to see me suffer?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Ling Tian regained consciousness, Justice had already noticed it and could not help but lament in his heart, This fellow is Ling Tian indeed. Even after taking a spin in the gates of hell, he is still able to maintain such calmness. Apart from the time where he let you an unbearable groan after just waking up, he actually did not let out a second cry of pain. Just what kind of willpower would be required for that?</p><br/><p>Just when he was silently praising Ling Tian in his heart, he never expected to hear Ling Tian\u2019s sarcastic comments. Justice frowned and looked at Ling Tian with a tinge of dissatisfaction. What does this guy take me for? He actually dares to order me around now?! In the world today, who would have the guts to order me around like that? He is truly too bold! It seems like the pain he suffered isn\u2019t enough!</p><br/><p>Taking two steps forward, he grabbed onto Ling Tian\u2019s hair with one of his hand and began spanking Ling Tian\u2019s ass with his other hand. With every single spanking landing right on his wounds, Ling Tian took in a breath of cold air and his eyes narrowed. Just when he was about to start cursing, he heard a tearing sound as though the bark of a tree was being ripped apart from the trunk\u2026</p><br/><p>Justice pulled Ling Tian up mercilessly and the ripping sound was from Ling Tian\u2019s skin being ripped off from the stony ground\u2026 even his flesh was forcibly ripped out\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian, who was just about to let out a curse, began hissing in pain and almost fainted on the spot. His whole body immediately broke out in cold sweat and everywhere his sweat touched, it was as though the eighteen levels of hell was trickling down his body\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cF*********K!\u201d Ling Tian roared with anger, \u201cSiiiiii\u2026 who are you trying to kill?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to be a little more obedient now?\u201d Justice looked at Ling Tian in the eyes and said gently, \u201cWhy don\u2019t\u2026 I put you back down? I will respect your opinion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d Ling Tian immediately changed his attitude. Being on the losing end, he had no choice but to lower his head. \u201cIs the number one expert in the world, the Martial Order Medallion owner of Beyond Heavens, such a narrowminded person? Would a senior like you stoop down to the level of torturing someone? Hehehe\u2026 siiii\u2026 you\u2026\u201d Ling Tian was instead greeted with Justice\u2019s hands roaming around his wounds and replying with his smile, \u201cFlattery is useless against me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was enraged. \u201cI say, Justice, even if you are jealous about this young noble\u2019s assets, is there a need for this? A big grown man like you hugging my pure and untainted body. Don\u2019t you think that there is something wrong with this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice stared at Ling Tian coldly. \u201cIf you dare to spout another word from now on, I will definitely cut it off! The words of the Martial Order Medallion owner are no joke!\u201d Ling Tian immediately shut his mouth tightly. This killing maniac in front of him definitely wasn\u2019t joking and he would definitely carry out everything he said. If Justice is going to cut off Ling Tian\u2019s ****, regardless of whether or not he will be able to take his revenge in future, Ling Tian would only be able to train in the Sunflower Manual in the future.</p><br/><p>Justice dragged Ling Tian into the tent, and Ling Tian saw Xiao YanXue lying on the ground palely with a trace of blood at the corner of her lips. He could not help but let out a cry of surprise, \u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe suffered a shock thinking that you had died but her life isn\u2019t in danger.\u201d Ling Tian replied succinctly and heartlessly, \u201cWhere is the medicine?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the bag over there.\u201d Ling Tian grumbled, \u201cYou actually do not carry any medicine with you when roaming the pugilistic world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will never need to use it,\u201d Justice said calmly and took out the top-quality medicine that Ling Tian had prepared.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a bitter laugh. Even with his arrogance, he did not dare to roam the pugilistic world without medicine. However, with Justice\u2019s peerless martial arts, the need of medicine was far too rare. Even if he needed to use it, it would definitely be for someone else. Just when he was about to scold himself for being slow-witted, he suddenly felt his body being thrown and a cool feeling on his back. Justice had already begun to tend to his wounds.</p><br/><p>Justice\u2019s actions were extremely swift and when Ling Tian\u2019s body was still in midair, Justice had already swiftly applied the medicine on more than ten wounds on Ling Tian\u2019s back. While Justice did not bring medicine along with him, his medicinal application technique was definitely top-notch. At the same time, the medicine which Ling Tian had prepared was a secret formula from his previous life. While it couldn\u2019t be considered a saint medicine that is the best in the world, Ling Tian immediately felt a wave of comfort all over his body with the pain subsiding slightly. However, he suddenly felt his muscles cramp up as a wave of intense pain assaulted his body which was already in pain. The sudden wave of intense pain made Ling Tian almost tear up\u2026 Justice hung Ling Tian\u2019s body in midair while he used his other hand to apply the medicine all around Ling Tian\u2019s body\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAOOOO\u2026\u201d Being assaulted by both internal and external pain together with being caught off guard, Ling Tian finally cried out in pain as he glared at Justice who was gloating at his misfortune, \u201cThis daddy here will duel you! You b*st*rd! What are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI truly look forward to that!\u201d Justice threw Ling Tian on the blanket and completely did not look like he was dealing with a wounded person. He then threw the bottle of medicine to the side and said unsympathetically, \u201cThere wasn\u2019t enough medicine. It ran out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian eyes almost popped out of its sockets, \u201cBoss! More than half of my wounds aren\u2019t covered yet, and you finished it all?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis daddy here is confident that my medicinal knowledge is peerless in the world. I have applied medicine to all the critical areas, and the remaining parts are superficial wounds. I also stopped the bleeding of your wounds with my inner qi, and you will definitely not die! Just bear with it. Your wounds will recover in less than seven days.\u201d Justice spat out these words and left.</p><br/><p>Profanities flowed out from Ling Tian\u2019s mouth like an unending river and despite his cursing, Ling Tian also realized that his injuries were truly much better. Justice\u2019s medicinal prowess was something that even Ling Tian would admit his inferiority to. Dammit, is this old brat the number one expert in the world or the number one divine doctor? With such outstanding medicinal knowledge, he actually does not carry with him any medicine. Dammit\u2026</p><br/><p>A short while later, Justice\u2019s head stuck into the tent again as he lamented, \u201cYou are truly the number one scholar who shocked the world. After cursing for a full five minutes, you actually did not repeat a single phrase. Even with such serious injuries, you aren\u2019t even panting at all. I cannot help but admire you for something else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis daddy can scold you for a full day and night! You f**ker!\u201d Ling Tian lost his rationality from anger, \u201cA dragon would truly be bullied by a shrimp in shallow waters and a tiger will be bullied by a cat when it leaves the mountain! A cat which obtains victory will celebrate like a tiger and a leg feather of a phoenix can\u2019t be compared to a chicken. I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice chuckled while standing at the opening of the tent and looking at Ling Tian babbling on, he took out a small bottle from his embrace. After pouring out a white powder from it and tasting it, he asked Ling Tian with an amiable smile, \u201cThis is salt right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s mouth hung opened as he looked at the small bottle in Justice\u2019s hand without daring to say anything. With regards to Justice\u2019s idea that he had not said, Ling Tian naturally understood it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least you are tactful!\u201d Justice\u2019s expression suddenly turned cold, \u201cTend to your wounds properly, I have something to ask you later.\u201d he then let down the folds of the tent before walking out.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Ling Tian seemed to have thought of something and shouted out, \u201cF**k, Justice! You should at least give me something to cover myself with right? There is still a lady beside me\u2026\u201d However, not a single sound could be heard from outside the tent and Justice had already disappeared\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at his stark naked body helplessly and began muttering under his breath. It wouldn\u2019t matter if he didn\u2019t think about it, but after thinking about it, young noble Ling\u2019s dragon began to grow active again\u2026 this made Ling Tian completely dumbfounded. You are going to be so energetic even at such a time? Do you really want my life?</p><br/><p>Currently, there were only three parts of Ling Tian\u2019s body which were still mobile: his mouth, his eyes, and little young noble Ling\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian prayed in his heart, towards Buddha, towards Jesus\u2026 he prayed to every single deity which he knew. Miss Xiao, since it is so rare for you to be unconscious, please stay unconscious for a while more. If you are going to get up at this time, I will not have the face to face anyone else in future. It also wouldn\u2019t be good for you either\u2026</p><br/><p>Right when he was thinking about the thing which he feared most currently, Miss Xiao began to stir. Ling Tian rolled his eyes and was completely helpless. Alright then, if you aren\u2019t going to remain unconscious, I shall be the one unconscious\u2026 Young noble Ling then \u2018fainted\u2019 in his birthday suit with his face bright red, leaving behind an\u2026 upright pillar\u2026</p><br/><p>As Xiao YanXue gradually regained consciousness, the first thing she thought about what Ling Tian\u2019s death. She struggled to get up and was about to burst out crying. However, before she could cry, she saw Ling Tian lying down by her side and her tears immediately turned into joy and surprise. Following that, she gasped in embarrassment and bashfulness. She obviously saw Ling Tian\u2019s tall pillar and as a lady born in an aristocratic family, she naturally had an understanding of such things\u2026</p><br/><p>After which, she shouted out in shock, obviously noticing the horrible wounds on Ling Tian\u2019s body. Ling Tian then noticed the surroundings around him turning silent before hearing a silent sobbing by his side. Then, a pair of gentle hands stroked his body gently and carefully as though she was afraid of causing him pain\u2026</p><br/><p>A rustling sound could then be heard followed by a ripping sound as though Xiao YanXue ripped something apart and was looking for something. Then, her footsteps could be heard, and she walked to Ling Tian\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then heard Xiao YanXue\u2019s hesitant and shy voice, \u201cThankfully he\u2019s\u2026 unconscious\u2026\u201d Just when Ling Tian was wondering why Xiao YanXue would say that, he felt Xiao YanXue wrapping up his wounds and her soft lips moving around his wounds to apply a cool medicinal paste on his body. Throughout the whole process, Ling Tian actually didn\u2019t feel any pain at all despite his serious wounds! It could be seen just how gentle Xiao YanXue was. She could be said to be cautious to the extreme!</p><br/><p>Of course, Xiao YanXue\u2019s treatment methods could not be compared to Justice in terms of effect. Justice\u2019s treatment method was only concerned about saving Ling Tian\u2019s life and he could not be bothered about whether or not Ling Tian felt pain or how much pain Ling Tian felt. While Justice\u2019s treatment method was also extremely mystical and gentle, if Ling Tian had a choice, he would not be willing to allow another man to touch him all over. Although he might end up dying if he wasn\u2019t touched\u2026</p><br/><p>The injuries on Ling Tian\u2019s front were all taken care of carefully by Xiao YanXue, even his thighs, abdomen, and even toes\u2026 Xiao YanXue used her flower-like lips to gently and meticulously tend to all of Ling Tian\u2019s wounds. In order to prevent Ling Tian from feeling any pain, she even cleaned Ling Tian\u2019s wounds with her lips!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was covered in blood all over and was even stained by mud and grass in some places. His body was truly extremely dirty with his flesh being exposed and scars all over his body\u2026 Ling Tian truly could not imagine just how Xiao YanXue was able to do this! Just how was she able to do that?!</p><br/><p>Growing up leading a pampered life, how would this little princess of the number one financial magnate accomplish all of these without an extremely deep love for Ling Tian? Even among couples who spent all of their life together, how many of them would be able to treat their other half with such care and concern?!</p><br/><p>This pure love of hers was just too rare!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was extremely moved in his heart but also had a tinge of guilt!</p><br/><p>If he was still going to be suspicious of a lady like this who was willing to treat him in such a manner, then he was truly worse than a swine! After this round of Xiao YanXue treating his wounds, Ling Tian came to a conclusion in his heart. No matter what and no matter how tough the journey in the future will be, this woman is mine for sure! I must definitely treat her well, dote on her, love her and cherish her!</p><br/><p>Under Xiao YanXue\u2019s meticulous care, Ling Tian, who was originally pretending to be unconscious gradually felt a wave of sleepiness gradually overwhelming him. After finally being unable to bear with the enticement of the sleep demon, Ling Tian fell asleep gradually\u2026</p><br/><p>This incident had strained his usually powerful spirit to the extreme. After fighting with pain for such a long time, his last shred of strength was spent and he felt a wave of comfort in Xiao YanXue\u2019s embrace, falling asleep comfortably\u2026</p><br/><p>Justice sat down quietly outside with the Heaven Splitter in one hand and the mysterious jade pendant in his other hand. Studying it quietly under the sunlight, his brows were furrowed and even after studying it for a long while, he could not see through the mystery of the jade pendant still. Letting out a sigh, he put down the jade pendant.</p><br/><p>Looking at the tent silently, a smile could be seen on his face with a slightly complicated look! While Ling Tian may not know about the condition of his own body currently, how would Justice, who was a martial arts grandmaster, not be able to understand the condition of Ling Tian\u2019s body? After this incident, while Ling Tian\u2019s cultivation may not increase greatly, he definitely received a great benefit!</p><br/><p>Even though his injuries were so frightening!</p><br/><p>In truth, after Justice\u2019s treatment, Ling Tian\u2019s injuries were no longer an issue and were instead a blessing in disguise. After Ling Tian\u2019s meridians were almost shattered, while he had to endure an intense pain that no one else would be able to endure, Ling Tian had also gained benefits that no one else would be able to gain! At that moment, Ling Tian\u2019s meridians had expanded to an unprecedented width under the explosive pressure from last night!</p><br/><p>Even the width of Justice\u2019s meridians couldn\u2019t be compared to Ling Tian!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

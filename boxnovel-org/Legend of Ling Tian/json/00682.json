However, she quickly lifted her head up and her face returned back to her chilly self, \u201cThat\u2019s right! The First Pavilion Head roams unhindered in the world and is an unparalleled existence in the world. How can he belong to YouHan alone? There are numerous individuals who have such a hero in their hearts! Is it wrong for me to admire such an expert?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see!\u201d Ling Tian smiled, \u201cMiss, I have seen the First Pavilion Head who you were talking about before. It\u2019s true! I have even worked together with the First Pavilion before. From the few assassination missions that I arranged, it should be easy to tell that I have worked with the First Pavilion Head before. Ah ah\u2026 actually, it isn\u2019t too surprising for the member of a Great Family to meet the First Pavilion Head\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He then paused with a smile on his face which didn\u2019t seem like a smile. Xiao YouHan\u2019s eyes lit up immediately and she dashed over losing all composure, \u201cReally? Have you seen him before? How does he look like? He must be very handsome right? How tall is he? Is his face always frosty and expressionless? Does he have a dense and sharp killing intent all over him? Is he like an arrogant lotus resting at the peak of an ice mountain? He shouldn\u2019t be too young anymore and it would be best if he isn\u2019t more than 40\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough cough\u2026\u201d Ling Jian began coughing pathetically.</p><br/><p>Xiao YouHan\u2019s gaze swept past Ling Jian before she said to Ling Tian, \u201cYoung noble Ling Tian, how can your subordinate be so rude?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 errr\u2026 I will definitely teach him a good lesson.\u201d Ling Tian was caught off guard by the series of questions and his sides were already aching from holding in his laughter. \u201cI didn\u2019t notice all of these things but the First Pavilion Head is probably someone pleasing to the eye. He has quite the character and I don\u2019t think that he is even thirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nonsense, if he wasn\u2019t pleasing to the eye, why would I bother keeping him beside me for ten plus years to groom? He is indeed less than thirty years and probably no more than one to two years older than young noble Ling Tian. It seems like he is even less than 20!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian finally understood where this lass\u2019 frosty expression came from. It turns out that she heard about the First Pavilion Head\u2019s frosty personality and wanted to mimic him\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian wasn\u2019t the only one who guessed this and Ling Chen, Li Xue, and Xiao FengYang had a look of understanding on their faces. No wonder this lass had such a huge change in her personality a few years back! To think that the family assumed that Above Heavens had tortured her\u2026</p><br/><p>This celebrity chaser was truly too crazy! Ling Chen winked at Ling Jian and Ling Jian\u2019s face flushed completely red.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot even thirty? Wouldn\u2019t that mean that he is extremely young?\u201d Xiao YouHan\u2019s eyes glimmered as though she was shot by cupid\u2019s arrow. \u201cReally? Is he really so young???\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am certain about this! That First Pavilion Head is definitely less than thirty and may not even be twenty. Furthermore, he is still unmarried,\u201d Ling Tian said solemnly before adding on, \u201cFurthermore, I have never seen any ladies appear by his side before!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?!\u201d Xiao YouHan had the urge to jump up in excitement. \u201cThis is great! Hmph! I knew it! A hero like him would not have ordinary ladies in his eyes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YouHan had already gone into complete fan-girl mode and completely didn\u2019t notice that Ling Tian\u2019s words were pretty incoherent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, only a beauty like Miss would be a match for someone like the First Pavilion Head.\u201d Ling Tian said with sincerity.</p><br/><p>Xiao YouHan immediately squirmed with awkwardness and said expectantly, \u201cI\u2026 I also\u2026\u201d All of a sudden, her eyes lit up with a bright glow and she pleaded, \u201cYoung noble Ling, I wonder if you are able to give me the opportunity to meet him once? I really want to meet this amazing talent!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately frowned with frustration in his eyes as though he was extremely troubled, \u201cThis\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble Ling definitely has an idea, hehe.\u201d Xiao YouHan took up the teapot and began filling up Ling Tian\u2019s teacup with an expectant gaze.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian drank the cup of tea calmly and the moment he placed the cup back on the table, Xiao YouHan quickly filled it up again as though she was afraid that she wasn\u2019t taking care of Ling Tian properly.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian frowned, \u201cIt is difficult to talk to that person\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was speechless. While it isn\u2019t easy for others to talk to me, for young noble\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao YouHan almost burst out into tears.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ling Tian was going a little too far, both Ling Chen and Li Xue stretched their hands out to Ling Tian\u2019s waist and were about to pinch down with all their strength.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian pretended as though an idea came to his mind and quickly changed his tone, \u201c\u2026 however, it isn\u2019t as though there isn\u2019t a way at all. Since we are all of the same family, I shall just ignore this face of mine and help Miss with this matter! Besides, I believe that the First Pavilion Head will like someone as adorable as Miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you young noble Ling, thank you young noble Ling. You are really a good person!\u201d Xiao YouHan was filled with boundless joy and looked as though her long-standing wish was finally fulfilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d Ling Tian said with difficulty.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it is truly difficult for this brother of mine to assassinate Meng FanYun\u2026 Since Miss is extremely familiar with Above Heavens, I wonder if\u2026 you can give us some aid?\u201d Ling Tian said with embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026 this\u2026\u201d Xiao YouHan quickly came to a conclusion, \u201cNo problem! He is carrying out this mission for my Xiao Family and it is only right for me to help him! You can call me along when you are about to take action. Mmm\u2026 as long as he doesn\u2019t die on the spot, I will have a way to save him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian rolled his eyes. Before even starting the mission, this young Miss is already thinking of how to save me\u2026 doesn\u2019t she have too little confidence in her idol?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026 Thanks! I will definitely try my best to have the First Pavilion Head repay your gratitude!\u201d Ling Tian said with gratitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much.\u201d Xiao YouHan said in embarrassment before asking excitedly, \u201cThen\u2026 when will young noble Ling allow me to\u2026\u201d As though she thought of something, her face flushed completely red.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen this matter is over, I will immediately contact that First Pavilion Head.\u201d Ling Tian purposefully emphasized the words \u2018First Pavilion Head\u2019 and said with a righteous tone, \u201cMiss should know that I, Ling Tian, will never go back on my words.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 of course.\u201d Xiao YouHan seemed to have something else to say but decided to remain silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured Miss,\u201d Ling Tian promised, \u201cI am good friends with that First Pavilion Head and he treats my opinion with great importance. If I say anything, he will definitely consider it carefully. Even if I want to be a matchmaker, I believe that he will not reject me. I will definitely put in a few good words for Miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Xiao YouHan cried out with excitement and began her imagination, \u201cIf\u2026 if\u2026 it would be great\u2026\u201d She then suddenly lowered her head with her entire face red. At the same time, she did not forget to roll her eyes at Ling Jian. In order to see my idol, I can only let you off with some benefits! Hmph!</p><br/><p>By the side, Ling Jian was completely helpless and did not know where to hide his face\u2026</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cWAHAHAHA\u2026 this is too hilarious! She is too cute!\u201d Ling Tian burst out into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is so young? Do you really mean that he is still so young? He he he\u2026 he is still a young man??? This is great! Hmph, I knew that a hero like him will not place ordinary ladies in his sight!\u201d Ling Chen mimicked Xiao YouHan\u2019s voice and teased Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you seen him before? How does he look like? He must be very handsome right? How tall is he? Is his face always frosty and expressionless? Does he have a dense and sharp killing intent all over him? Is he like an arrogant lotus resting at the peak of an ice mountain? Is he\u2026 is he\u2026\u201d Li Xue burst out into laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two young Misses, I was wrong, please let me off\u2026\u201d Ling Jian almost wanted to find a hole to hide in.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the first time I realized that Ah Jian is an expert at picking up girls.\u201d Ling Tian and the others were naturally back in their own tent and they were speaking in hushed voices, \u201cHow magnificent! Without even saying a word, you already captured the beauty\u2019s heart. You are indeed the best example for lechers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is a pity that this lecher does not know how to date!\u201d Li Xue clicked her tongue and said, \u201cLing Jian, you are truly too useless. You actually treated her as your heart demon and even said that you wanted to kill her. Hahahaha\u2026 I am going to die from laughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment these words were said, all three of them burst out into laughter again.</p><br/><p>A long while later, Ling Tian finally managed to stop himself from laughing, \u201cAh Jian, I have already given you the chance. It is up to you to grasp it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian rubbed his head and said, \u201cYoung noble, you mean to say that\u2026 I really\u2026 like her? It isn\u2019t my heart demon making trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a long sigh and covered his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill your heart race when you see her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that she is extremely pretty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have the urge to hug her when you see her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 yes\u2026 a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really want to become closer to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there is someone who wants to bully her, beat her, or kill her, what will you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho dares to?!\u201d Ling Jian roared with killing intent exploding, \u201cI will dice the person into shreds!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she marries someone else and sleeps with someone in the same bed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d Before Ling Tian could even finish, Ling Jian\u2019s eyes turned red, \u201cShe is mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram! Scram scram scram!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter saying so much, let me ask you, is she your heart demon or do you like her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 I think that I like her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why aren\u2019t you going to scram?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Jian left pathetically.</p><br/><p>In the tent, Ling Chen and Li Xue were holding on to their stomachs as they panted heavily. \u201cHe is truly too\u2026 too amazing.\u201d Li Xue laughed to the point tears flowed out of her eyes as she rolled on the bed without the slightest appearance of a lady.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled and pounced on the two ladies like a starving wolf, pinning the two of them under his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAH!! Lecher!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScram hoodlum!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about it? Did you overestimate yourself and receive a scolding?\u201d Just when Ling Jian left the tent, a cold face looked at him with a tinge of disdain and delight in his misfortune. Xiao YouHan had returned to the cold appearance that she had picked up from the First Pavilion Head.</p></div>\n</div>"}

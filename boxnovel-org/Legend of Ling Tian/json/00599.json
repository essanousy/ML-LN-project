I thought that you were already an ascended being out of the world and would not be bothered by such pointless things as a reputation. I never imagined that you would still be tied down by the pursuit of reputation. My dear brother Justice, I am truly disappointed by you. It is my fault and I apologize to you.\u201d As he said that, Ling Tian shook his head as though he was truly disappointed.</p><br/><p>Justice was angered to the point he almost exploded. Even if I cannot be bothered about my reputation, it isn\u2019t for you to trample on it, right? Can this be considered an apology? Or are you trying to ridicule me?! Just when he was about to reply, Ling Tian continued, \u201cForget it, the lack of your mental state is an oversight on my part and I apologize for that. Don\u2019t you want to settle our debt? After this matter is over, I will find another two or three helpers and ensure that I will give you an explanation. I definitely won\u2019t allow you to suffer a loss. How about that?\u201d He then waved his hands with magnanimity.</p><br/><p>Justice had the urge to beat Ling Tian up on the spot!</p><br/><p>Little b*st*rd, this daddy was here to seek an explanation from you but ended up becoming a bodyguard for your Ling Family Courtyard. Now that you are back, you do not even bother to thank me? Even though this daddy can\u2019t be bothered about it, you also can\u2019t ridicule me as such right? Justice then snorted and his voice turned chilly, \u201cIf not for the fact that you are facing both internal and external troubles together with your weakened state, this daddy would definitely teach you a lesson right now. Do you still remember that crisp slap from a while back? That wonderful feeling was something that this seat remembers until now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Ling Tian clenched his teeth in resentment. All his life, he had never suffered from such loss but was smacked in the ass by the old brat in front of him. While Ling Tian did not have the time right now, he swore to take his revenge one day! When the matters here were settled and his inner qi was recovered, he would call on Ling Jian, Ling Chen, and Li Xue to join hands with him to beat Justice up into a pig head!</p><br/><p>Justice looked at Lei ZhenTian who was anxiously having a discussion with his aides and reminded Ling Tian by compressing his voice into a line, \u201cHow long more do you need? They are going to take action soon.\u201d In truth, the two of them were talking to each other just so they could buy some time for Ling Tian to recover his strength. With Ling Tian\u2019s return, Justice would not be able to aid the Ling Family Courtyard any longer in consideration of his Beyond Heavens\u2019 status!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian rolled his eyes before shutting his eyes to feel his inner qi which was weaving through his river-wide meridians. After a long while, he opened his eyes, \u201cIt\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Ling Tian returned, he immediately understood what Lei ZhenTian was thinking. Regardless of Beyond Heavens or Justice himself, Lei ZhenTian would naturally not want to offend them if possible. While Justice had already announced his stance and had even heavily injured the Second Master of his Lei Family, Lei ZhenTian still did not want to offend Justice. Recklessly offending the number one hidden sect in the world or perhaps the number one expert in the world would be akin to declaring his own death sentence. Ling Tian was also fortunate that Justice was present to awe the Lei Family troops, thus saving the lives of Ling Chen and his other subordinates. Even Ling Tian at his peak would not have the prestige to strike fear into the hearts of the Lei Family soldiers! Since that was the case, even if Ling Tian was able to wipe out all of the Lei Family forces, the severely wounded Ling Chen and the others would definitely perish in battle!</p><br/><p>That was why Ling Tian chose to start a conversation with Justice the moment he arrived. He knew that as long as he was talking to Justice, Lei ZhenTian would not dare to risk angering Justice by interrupting their conversation!</p><br/><p>The time spent talking to Justice was also the best opportunity for Ling Tian to recover his inner qi. Ling Tian\u2019s guess was truly extremely accurate. During the time where he was talking to Justice, Lei ZhenTian glanced at him a few times with impatience and viciousness but did not dare to make a single sound or order an attack,</p><br/><p>Ling Chen looked at Ling Tian sweetly with tears filling up her eyes. When she was in a state of complete hopelessness, her most beloved man appeared in front of her. It was just like many years back when a warm pair of hands appeared in the life of a hopeless little girl. At this moment, Ling Chen felt a boundless happiness and her nose began to turn sour. If she wasn\u2019t in front of everyone, she would have definitely burst out into tears.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled and stretched out his arms to pull the petite figure into his embrace. With tenderness in his eyes, he asked gently, \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen leaned in his warm embrace as though she was a bullied child who was in her parent\u2019s embrace. Just when she was about to start wailing, she remembered that she was in a public place with everyone staring at them. She suppressed her emotions but her body could not help but tremble as tears flowed down her cheeks and she said with a shaky voice, \u201cYoung noble\u2026 I thought\u2026 I thought that I wouldn\u2019t be able to see you again in this lifetime of mine\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sent out a warm inner qi through his hand which was placed on her waist and dotingly said, \u201cSilly lass, why wouldn\u2019t you be able to see me again? You still have to accompany me until our hair turns grey. Be good, don\u2019t cry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen felt a wave of warmth spread throughout her meridians and her previously severe internal injuries were immediately much better. The pain in her chest had also disappeared. Hearing Ling Tian\u2019s gentle voice, she nodded her head obediently before squirming in his embrace\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian adjusted the condition of Ling Chen\u2019s body silently and he glanced at the walls of the Ling Family Courtyard intentionally. The corners of his lips were then curved up in a smirk and he stepped forward with a loud roar, \u201cWho is Lei ZhenTian?! Get out here for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The troops of the Lei Family already couldn\u2019t stand the sight of the brat in front of them. Behaving intimately with a woman the moment he appeared and actually behaving in such a rude manner now. They were immediately incensed and a burly man scolded, \u201cLittle b*st*rd, what bullsh*t are you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could even finish, Ling Tian smiled and a silver light appeared suddenly without him even making a move. The silver light disappeared in a flash and the burly man cried out in agony before collapsing onto the ground with blood flowing down from his eyes. After rolling on the ground a few times, he then remained motionless and his breathing stopped\u2026</p><br/><p>Of the few thousand people present, only Justice and Lei ZhenTian could see the silver flashing light. The rest were completely clueless and only saw how the burly man collapsed onto the floor and died without any reason. Such a frightening and formless killing method made everyone gasp in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian? You were actually able to make it back on time?\u201d Lei ZhenTian\u2019s eyes narrowed as he looked at Ling Tian. He then burst out laughing viciously, \u201cSo what if you can return on time? Does the Ling Family Courtyard still have the strength to fight against my Lei Family army? HAHA, did you rush back to your death? I truly welcome you so I can wipe all of you out together! Since the Martial Order Medallion owner is also here to settle scores with you, this untalented Lei ZhenTian is willing to settle scores on his behalf!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian was a famed figure in the continent and despite facing the overbearing Ling Tian, he was still able to respond with a smile. At the same time, he tried to sow discord between Ling Tian and Justice with his words. After all, Justice was far too frightening. Even though Ling Tian\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t to be underestimated, it was still within Lei ZhenTian\u2019s expectations. Of course, this was only what he thought!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled in response, \u201cThe sky isn\u2019t dark yet but Family Head Lei is already dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian grinned malevolently, \u201cIt should be extremely clear just who is dreaming. What does young noble Ling think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed loudly.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the sound of galloping horses could be heard from all directions and they were the last minute reinforcements that Ling Tian had summoned. The sounds of the galloping horses were extremely disorganized and they obviously did not belong to the same commander. However, there were definitely plenty troops. A mocking smile could be seen on Ling Tian\u2019s face, \u201cI think Family Head Lei should be extremely clear about who is dreaming right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian\u2019s eyes widened in anger as he said hatefully, \u201cLing Tian, it is too early for you to be gloating! Attack!\u201d His final word was a command to his Lei Family warriors.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled cruelly, \u201cWhile Family Head Lei can\u2019t wait to kill me, I am an extremely benevolent person who will repay enmity with benevolence. Regardless of the cost, I will have to keep Family Head Lei\u2019s life here. Family Head Lei, Lei ZhenTian, old b*st*rd! Without my command, you won\u2019t be allowed to die even if you want to.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian said that, he waved his hand and two black figures wove into the formation of the Lei Family warriors like two ferocious beasts pouncing into a herd of sheep. A series of miserable groans sounded and in just a few short moments, more than seventy lives were gone!</p><br/><p>A portion of them had a red spot on their neck as they rolled on the ground with whatever remaining life they had. A portion of them had their bodies dismembered with their body parts scattering all around. Finally, the rest of them were frozen into ice sculptures with their body collapsing onto the ground lifelessly.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian and Li Xue had returned right on time.</p><br/><p>A short while after Ling Tian returned to the Courtyard, the two of them had also arrived at the Courtyard. Under Ling Tian\u2019s orders, they hid and adjusted their inner qi while waiting for an opportunity.</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian clenched his teeth and ignored the miserable groans behind him and charged at Ling Tian with his two remaining Elders! As long as he could kill Ling Tian, the objective of his mission would be accomplished. At the same time, he did not forget to roar, \u201cI hope that Sir will be able to maintain your neutral stance and not help any side. Lei ZhenTian will always remember your favor.\u201d In his heart, the most dangerous person was still Justice. But since Justice did not seem like he wanted to take action, Lei ZhenTian would naturally not provoke him.</p><br/><p>Justice snorted with a tinge of helplessness. This daddy here does not have the energy to interfere in that brat\u2019s affairs. With his sh*tty character, this daddy cannot be bothered!</p><br/><p>However, Justice could not be completely idle either as Ling Tian\u2019s voice sounded in his ears, \u201cMay older brother help me to look after my injured brothers. I know that older brother\u2019s medical skills are also unmatched in the world.\u201d Ling Tian then charged out before shouting out again, \u201cI have good wine! I will give older brother a jug after matters here are settled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice did not know whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>With just the price of some wine you want the number one expert in the world to be your bodyguard? Isn\u2019t the worth of the number one expert far too low? However, he also could not do anything about it. After all, he couldn\u2019t possibly settle his score with Ling Tian at this moment, right? Since Ling Tian called him \u2018older brother\u2019 at the very least, his attitude could be considered to be barely passable.</p><br/><p>Justice sighed with depression and unsheathed his sword. Using the tip of his sword to carve out a line along the ground, he ordered coldly, \u201cDeath to those who cross the line!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

To see through it? Would I be able to face it? Or accept it? Justice asked himself honestly, suddenly feeling a strand of guilt! In front of this dying youth who was his opponent, Justice suddenly felt that he did not possess the right to despise this person! Neither did he have the right to sentence this person to death!</p><br/><p>While he might be called Heavenly Justice, but to himself, did he really have the qualifications to call himself Heavenly Justice?!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had already given up. Be it energy or his state of mind, both had already reached their limits! He could no longer control the violent internal energy inside him, that much he knew. The next instant would be him imploding due to the excess of energy. However, Ling Tian was still extremely calm within his heart. While he regretted, while he had attachments\u2026. But\u2026 everything didn\u2019t matter anymore. Just start from the beginning once again!</p><br/><p>A secretive smile appeared on Ling Tian\u2019s face, and he slowly closed his eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>The internal energy in his body was still violently revolving, and when it finally reached maximum velocity, all the atmospheric energy that was entering Ling Tian\u2019s body like a whirlpool suddenly came to a screeching halt! After that moment of silence, one could see Ling Tian\u2019s exposed skin suddenly shrink before ballooning out rapidly. Popping sounds could be heard as his skin split apart in multiple places, giving a shock to anyone who saw it\u2026</p><br/><p>Justice sighed once loudly, turning his body around. He could not bear to look any longer. Never in his dreams would he expect that a genius rarely seen even in a millennium would actually be buried in this place!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a crisp \u2018ding!\u2019 sound could be heard, and a pale green ray of light flashed in front of Ling Tian\u2019s chest as a simple and unadorned jade pendant suddenly leaped out as though being pulled by an invisible hand. It mysteriously floated in mid-air, letting out little rays of light, accompanied by a faint fog, causing the scene to become blurry.</p><br/><p>Clang! The Heaven Splitter on the back of Justice suddenly shot out of its sheath on its own volition, letting out a cold light from its half-finished body. In the moonlight, it gleamed with resplendence, freezing in mid-air without falling back into the sheath. The cold killing intent exuded by the sword could be felt on the nape of Justice, causing goosebumps to form\u2026</p><br/><p>As for the rampaging violent energy that was about to blast Ling Tian\u2019s body to bits, it calmed down all of a sudden, and a hissing sound was heard, as a tiny black dot, squirmed into the jade pendant as though it had a life of its own\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had already slipped into unconsciousness, or else he would have recognized the little black dot as belonging to the jade given to him by Shui QianRou, the Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade, as flexible as water! After being shattered by Yu ManLou the other time, Ling Tian had conveniently scooped up the black dot\u2026 which was now boring into the other jade pendant he carried with him, Yu BingYan\u2019s token of love\u2026 as sleek as clouds!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had even voiced his suspicions before, that the heirlooms of the Shui and Yu Family were actually the same, as though they were made to be a pair\u2026</p><br/><p>The light glow from the jade pendant shone on Ling Tian\u2019s body, and the recklessly rampaging energy, as though receiving a command, obediently surged into the jade pendant. As the speed of absorption increased, the jade started to let out a faint red color. Finally, with an explosion of light, a beam shot out, landing on the Heaven Splitter behind Justice!</p><br/><p>The Heaven Splitter let out a shrill cry as it gave out resplendent beams of light, strangely suspending itself in mid-air. The sword tip pointed towards Ling Tian as it shot out a stream of white sword energy to link them together\u2026</p><br/><p>At this point, one man, one jade, and one sword actually formed a continuous and unbroken chain\u2026</p><br/><p>Blood, azure, and white. The three colors continuously changed places, restlessly revolving\u2026</p><br/><p>When the jade pendant first appeared, Justice had immediately recognized it as the heirloom of the Yu Family, the Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade! This piece of jade had already been passed through quite a few hands in the Yu and Shui Family, and being the cause of countless bloodshed, how could Justice as the Martial Order Medallion owner of the Beyond Heavens not recognize it? The jades were even kept within the Beyond Heavens Sect for a period of time! But what he never expected was for the jades to be on Ling Tian\u2019s body!</p><br/><p>The people who possessed knowledge of the jades were limited to only the Yu and Shui Families, as within lay a huge secret! However, even after a millennium, no one was able to actually crack the secret within. After a long time, it had turned into a mere keepsake heirloom, without anyone poring over it. To think that it could display such an effect on Ling Tian today!</p><br/><p>As for the Heaven Splitter, there was also the legend that with it one could rule the world, and it had similarly been passed down for a millennium! Could it be, that within these three, there was actually some sort of relation? Why had no one heard of it even after so long?</p><br/><p>Could it be that this millennium-old secret was about to be revealed today?</p><br/><p>What\u2026 what was this matter exactly?</p><br/><p>Justice was shocked as he watched this unexplainable scene occur in front of him. He only felt as though his worldview of whatever he learned in the past had been flipped upside down. Right now, all the knowledge in his brain had turned to mush. He tilted his head slightly, staring at the Heaven Splitter suspended above him, his eyes full of confusion.</p><br/><p>The sounds of \u2018xiu xiu xiu\u2019 given out by the beam continued to ring out, clear and distinct; Ling Tian was still in an unconscious state, and on his handsome face was a faint smile\u2026</p><br/><p>Justice could acutely feel that right now, the jade pendant, the Heaven Splitter, and Ling Tian, as well as heaven and earth, had combined to form one whole and that he had been excluded from it.</p><br/><p>This sort of feeling led to a sense of abandonment in his heart, and he could not help but let out a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Having such a fortuitous encounter, it was unknown as to whether Ling Tian\u2019s cultivation would receive yet another boost and allow him to break through once again. Justice\u2019s heart suddenly had a hint of anticipation. He had long confirmed that to Ling Tian this was an extremely dangerous situation, but also a once in a lifetime lucky chance!</p><br/><p>A secret that could not be unraveled for a millennium, how could it be ordinary?</p><br/><p>To think that he had spent so much effort, passed through so many places all in pursuit of Ling Tian, only to end up as his protector! Justice could not help but let out a mocking smile. D*mn his mother, how could this fellow\u2019s luck be so good?! If it wasn\u2019t for him coincidentally bringing the Heaven Splitter over, Ling Tian would have long ago turned into a pile of meat paste. But it was so at his moment of death, that Justice had spotted a hint of his life signature and ran over with his movement skill pushed to his maximum extent\u2026 what dogsh*t luck\u2026 d*mn!</p><br/><p>Based on Justice\u2019s eyes, he could naturally see that the Heaven Splitter was not something that could be excluded from this equation!</p><br/><p>Could it be that within this unseen world of spirits, everyone had their own destiny?</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Justice\u2019s face tightened as an incredulous thought surfaced in his mind. Could this\u2026 be the so-called Will of Heaven? The true Heaven\u2019s Will?!</p><br/><p>The calm and stoic face of Justice changed for the first time in a long while!</p><br/><p>If Justice were to make a move now, he was sure that he would be able to shatter the cycle of the three with just his strength, killing the defenseless Ling Tian under his palm! However, with his arrogance, how would Justice actually pull off such a deed? Even if he had to kill Ling Tian, he had to kill him openly!</p><br/><p>Heavenly Justice, this Martial Order Medallion owner who looked down on everyone in disdain, never stooped so low as to backstab someone!</p><br/><p>Even if Ling Tian were to rise to the same cultivation as me, so what? I, Heavenly Justice, have never been defeated before! How could there be an exception even if it\u2019s Ling Tian? A confident smile hung on the edges of Justice\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>A rustling sound was heard before, and Justice\u2019s heart jumped up as he subconsciously began to revolve his energy in preparation. While he did not care for any form of assassination, the current Ling Tian was someone that even a little kitten could disrupt and kill at this very moment. However, looking at the source, it turned out to be a frightened little rabbit that immediately scampered away. Justice laughed to himself, he really was reading too much into it. Since when had he actually began to really care about the life of this kid?</p><br/><p>Upon recalling the gaze of embracing one\u2019s incoming death coming from Ling Tian, Justice could not help but feel restless. Just what kind of realm had he reached in order to achieve that?!</p><br/><p>From the ancient times to the present, with the billions of people that were alive, including tyrants, scholars and martial arts experts, who was actually able to stare death in the face and smile as they walk from the light to the darkness? Who could be as unrestrained and easy as this youth in front of him? In this face, Justice could read Ling Tian\u2019s heart, and to the latter, dying was as casual as walking from one\u2019s room into the courtyard.</p><br/><p>It was not that he did not care, and neither had he seen through death, those two were still insufficient to explain his mentality. His was a sort of disdain, a contempt, treating it like just breathing.</p><br/><p>Justice stood quietly on the spot, staring at the sky without moving. Upon recalling the gaze Ling Tian sent towards him, he felt as though he was on the verge of touching the very core of the martial way. In an instant, he entered the state of \u2018No people, no me\u2019, forgetting about the two objects entirely\u2026 He seemed to have entered a mysterious realm at this moment, melding into both the heavens and the earth. While he seemed to be still standing in the same position, he gave off the feeling like he was part of the void itself\u2026</p><br/><p>As for the layer of energy surrounding himself, it suddenly ballooned out, forming a huge bubble that encased both him and Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>It was not known how long a time had passed, before the Heaven Splitter let out a clear cry and dropped down, the point stabbing smoothly into the hard rock of the mountain. The jade pendant also fell from the sky, landing beside Ling Tian on the ground. As for the three colors that revolved in the sky, they had mysteriously disappeared.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian quietly lay on the ground, still unconscious. As for Justice, he maintained his old position of looking up, without moving even a single inch.</p><br/><p>The clouds in the sky as well as the moon, coming and going, shed light on this scene, being the only two who bore witness to this mysterious scene happening.</p><br/><p>Time continued flowing like water, quietly and steadily, without a hint of stopping\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

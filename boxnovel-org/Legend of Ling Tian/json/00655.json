Because they are all heroes in the world! Such mutual respect is something that any accomplished individual would have and it isn\u2019t considered much. However, you only have Yu ManTian in your sights but do you have Yu ManLou? Aren\u2019t Yu ManLou\u2019s ambitious means something worthy of respect? What about the first elder of the Shui Family, Shui WuBo? Could it be that his martial arts aren\u2019t worthy of your respect? His martial arts were trained by him step by step and not raised by external medicinal substances like yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile friends are important in our lives, having an enemy who you can treat with complete sincerity is truly rare! Such an enemy will spice up your ordinary life and even if you end up losing, it will be a life worth living! Such an enemy is worthy of respect. When facing such an individual and when it is destined for both of you to be on opposing sides, it is best to kill him the moment you get the chance to do so!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKilling him would be giving the biggest respect to him!\u201d Ling Tian said in a carefree manner, \u201cJust like Yu ManLou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for Yu ManTian, he isn\u2019t someone like that and will never be our enemy.\u201d Ling Tian said slowly, \u201cThus, you shouldn\u2019t kill him. While he is a boorish individual, he is worthy of making him a friend. With the current complicated relationship between the Yu and Ling Family, if Yu ManLou ends up in defeat and death, Yu ManTian will definitely not lead the troops of the Yu Family in revenge. At that time, Yu ManTian would be the best choice to stabilize the situation in the north! He would also be the only choice! This is also the reason why I am willing to spend so much effort on the Yu Family! The Yu Family is different from the Shui Family and they are far too important to the north!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of BingYan, Yu ManTang should have been the most suitable person. However, he is no longer the most suitable person.\u201d Ling Tian then looked at Ling Jian and said, \u201cYu ManLou can die but Yu ManTian must never die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand.\u201d Ling Jian felt as though a huge weight was lifted off his shoulders. He truly did not wish to kill this past, or even current, friend. Since he did not need to meet this friend of his on the battlefield, that was naturally the best!</p><br/><p>Third Master Yu was truly shining with glory at this moment. Not to mention the fact that he was suppressing Shui ManCheng at the moment, he even had the spare energy to tease, \u201cLittle three, you even brought your armor out today. Don\u2019t think that this Third Master wouldn\u2019t recognize you with your armor on. I truly have to say, this armor suits you extremely well and you have some taste!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words of his had almost angered Shui ManCheng to death and the anger that he had just suppressed began to boil again! His moves naturally began to be messed up again!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian felt all the more pleased in his heart and became even more arrogant. Every fist that he sent out would be accompanied by his loud hollering and every kick of his would be accompanied by his loud roar. Whenever his fists or feet landed on Shui ManCheng, he would let out a loud wave of laughter. With that loud voice of his, every time he laughed, the whole mountain would be filled with nothing but his laughter.</p><br/><p>If someone from the outside didn\u2019t know what was happening, they would definitely think that there was a circus around here.</p><br/><p>With Shui ManCheng\u2019s martial arts and mental state being inferior to Yu ManTian, he was toyed around pathetically by Yu ManTian. Despite being infuriated by Yu ManTian\u2019s vulgar appearance and language, Shui ManCheng was completely helpless and could only try his best to avoid all of Yu ManTian\u2019s attacks. This battle which should have been a close fight had turned into a completely one-sided battle because of someone\u2019s fear of death.</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng was filled with complete regret. He originally intended to fight for the honor of his dead son by placing his life on the line but he never expected to end up fearing death!</p><br/><p>Together with his burly figure, Yu ManTian looked extremely ferocious as he roared out loudly! Ling Tian almost wanted to burst out into loud applause and let out a loud cry: Brother Tian, you are truly ferocious!</p><br/><p>\u201cPower Smashing Three Passes!\u201d Yu ManTian jumped up into the sky and after displaying a cool pose, his palm swung down like a gigantic ax cleaving a huge mountain. Shui ManCheng clenched his teeth and raised his palms to receive the blow.</p><br/><p>With a loud bang, Yu ManTian\u2019s figure made a somersault in mid-air before letting out a surprised gasp. He then let out an eccentric roar and cried out with excitement, \u201cSweeping the Four Seas!\u201d</p><br/><p>Violent winds bellowed all around!</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng\u2019s eyes reddened as he charged forward without a care for his life or death only to hear Yu ManTian\u2019s snarky laughter, \u201cLittle three, quickly call for your Third Master. If this Third Master is happy, I can spare you from death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng\u2019s original title was Third Master as well and upon hearing Yu ManTian\u2019s snarky words when he was already on the verge of losing, he was immediately angered to the point his inner qi almost suffered from deviation! His hands could not help but be delayed for a short moment.</p><br/><p>An inch of difference was akin to the difference of a thousand miles in an exchange between experts!</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang bang bang bang\u2026.\u201d The moment Yu ManTian spotted the opening, his palms strike mercilessly smashed onto Shui ManCheng\u2019s chest and his palm strikes sounded like beating drums!</p><br/><p>The moment Yu ManTian\u2019s palms landed onto his chest, Shui ManCheng could only see despair before him. Taking in a deep breath, he stretched out his arms in an attempt to reach for Yu ManTian! At this moment, he no longer hoped to turn the situation around, he only wished to drag Yu ManTian down into the afterlife with him!</p><br/><p>However, it was a pity that his dire circumstances wouldn\u2019t be so easily turned around!</p><br/><p>Siiii!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian\u2019s shirt was ripped apart together with his flesh and he immediately began bleeding.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou and Yu ManTang immediately roared out together in anxiousness, \u201cThird brother!\u201d While one of them was worried about the safety of Yu ManTian, the other was reminding Yu ManTian to not kill Shui ManCheng\u2026</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian let out a loud roar and ignored the roars of his brothers. Raising his leg, his kick smashed onto Shui ManCheng\u2019s abdomen. In a fit of rage, all of his strength was imbued into this kick of his!</p><br/><p>Shui ManCheng let out a miserable shriek and his body flew into the sky like a large ball. After flying seventy feet into the air, blood sprayed out from all seven of his orifices.</p><br/><p>In that instant, the whole battlefield became silent!</p><br/><p>Everyone watched the sky before slowly lowering their head at the lifeless body smashing onto the ground like it was a pile of dirt\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYu ManTian from the Yu Family is victorious. Shui ManCheng dies in battle!\u201d the eagle-nosed elder announced.</p><br/><p>With his chest bloodied, Yu ManTian stood up proudly as he walked out from the battlefield like a hero returning from battle.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s bear trembled in rage and he was angered to the point he could not say a single word. While he had the heart to reprimand his younger brother, he could not help but feel his heart ache upon seeing Yu ManTian\u2019s wound. Yu ManTian was his youngest brother after all! Letting out a sigh, he waved his hand to instruct someone to tend to Yu ManTian\u2019s wounds.</p><br/><p>Looking at the plaza, Yu ManLou could not help but feel a ball of fire in his chest. Not only did the warriors of his family turn into the tools for the Shui Family to fight for power, he even had to help the direct descendants of the Shui Family clean up their mess\u2026</p><br/><p>The faces of the Shui Family members who belonged to Shui ManCheng\u2019s faction were all ashen! Looking at the previously awe-inspiring Third Master lying on the ground like a dead pig, the immense change was something that none of them could accept!</p><br/><p>Looking at the Yu Family\u2019s camp cheering loudly at their returning hero, all of their eyes burned with fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu ManTian! Do you dare to fight me one on one?!\u201d Shui ManShu stood up with rage all over his face and tears in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack down!\u201d Shui ManKong let out a roar, \u201cThe generational battles between the two families are not your private battles! Life or death is up to the heavens! The winner has no enmity and the loser has no grievances! This is the ancestral teaching of our family. Are you going to forget our ancestral teachings?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui ManShu glared at Shui ManKong hatefully without blinking his eyes. After a long while, he let out a heavy snort before sitting back down.</p><br/><p>If such a matter happened in the Yu Family, just this action of his would be akin to offending the family head\u2019s prestige and it was likely for Yu ManLou to execute him on the spot!</p><br/><p>While the Shui Family Head, Shui ManKong, did not take any action, his eyes gleamed with a cold light. At the same time, he snorted to himself in his heart. After this generational battle, it will be time for your demise. I shall allow all of you to be arrogant for a while more.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the plaza was extremely strange. Yu ManLou who was the victor did not seem too happy but Shui ManKong who was the loser looked extremely elated. While Shui ManKong was obviously trying to conceal the joy in his heart, it was impossible for him to conceal it entirely!</p><br/><p>The joy from having his revenge! The joy of his enemy dying before his very eyes!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong would never forget that his own son had died a wrongful death in the hands of Shui ManCheng\u2019s son! He hated the fact that he could not personally slice off Shui ManCheng\u2019s head! With regards to Shui ManCheng\u2019s death, he was completely overjoyed to the point he did not even want to conceal it!</p><br/><p>In the next two battles, the Yu Family achieved victory without a hitch and two more battles remained.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou versus Yu BingYan.</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo versus Yu ManLou!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian and Ling Jian were only looking forward to and interested in these two battles!</p><br/><p>As the members of the Shui Family split apart and revealed a path, a black-dressed Shui QianRou floated out from the camp of the Shui Family. On the Yu Family\u2019s side, Yu BingYan had a slight smile on her face as she walked out from the crowd looking like a weak figure.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang shook his head with a sigh and pain was plastered all over his face. Yu ManTian\u2019s fists were clenched tightly as he glared hatefully at Yu ManLou as though he wanted to eat Yu ManLou alive.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou turned his head around with his gaze slightly lowered but his body remained firm like a mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister BingYan?\u201d Shui QianRou opened her mouth first and asked gently.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister QianRou?\u201d Yu BingYan responded with a smile as the two looked at each other.</p><br/><p>These action of theirs immediately made everyone around come to a realization: Oh, these two ladies do not recognize each other.</p><br/><p>However, those who understood what was going on sneered in their hearts with disdain. These two lasses truly know how to put on an act! The two of them have already slept together on the same bed but can still act as though they don\u2019t know each other so naturally!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou and Shui ManKong sat up straight at the same time together. At this moment, these two Family Heads from the two families actually had the same thought!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou will win for sure! Yu BingYan will lose for sure!</p><br/><p>Losing meant death!</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan will die for sure?!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou felt a tinge of anxiousness in his heart and even felt his mouth turning dry. This mysterious feeling was one that he had not felt in a long time. As long as Yu BingYan died here today in Shui QianRou\u2019s hands, the Shui Family and Ling Tian would have an irreconcilable enmity!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong also felt a tinge of nervousness. As long as Shui QianRou won today, she would quickly return to Ling Tian\u2019s side. She would return to Ling Tian\u2019s side for her lifetime of happiness and the future of the Shui Family!</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful little sister BingYan, I am going to make my move.\u201d Shui QianRou\u2019s sword appeared like the flowing winds.</p><br/><p>With her pristine white robes, she raised her sword as though it was a brush and put up her guard. With the demeanor of an expert, she replied with a smile, \u201cBig sister can instruct me with your moves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Big sister can instruct me with your moves! These words were the signal that the two ladies had agreed upon. It meant that Yu BingYan was ready and they could begin the show.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou let out a crisp battle cry and she floated up like she was drifting in the winds. After she floated up to a certain altitude, her sword exploded forth with a silver glow and the sky seemed to be filled with a silvery starlight waterfall.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan raised her head up and with her sword as a brush, she wrote the word \u2018one\u2019 in mid-air! While the word seemed extremely ordinary, anyone who understood calligraphy would be able to tell that the word was formed from the start until the end with a single stroke, concealing its sharpness from within.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the calligraphy that an individual would use to write! While it seemed extremely imposing, the myriad of changes within that single stroke was something that one could only understand by studying the calligraphy carefully!</p><br/><p>As the silver light that was charging down came into contact with this calligraphy word, it suddenly swerved to the side.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan brandished her sword again and it was as though she was holding onto a brush that weighed a thousand catties. Her strokes were heavy but flowed smoothly from defense to attack.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou seemed to have been startled and her swordplay also transformed into the endless spring waters as she quickly put up her defense.</p><br/><p>Witnessing the battle between the two ladies, everyone felt as though their eyes were opened. While the martial arts of these two ladies weren\u2019t spectacular in this crowd, Yu BingYan\u2019s technique was extremely fresh and something that even Shui WuBo had never heard of before!</p><br/><p>While it seemed like Yu BingYan was only leisurely writing calligraphy, the strength within her attacks was surprising! Such a mystical martial arts technique attracted the attention of all the experts present and they could not take their eyes off the battle.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Shui QianRou\u2019s grasp of the \u2018Shui intent\u2019 was also something that made all of them gasp in admiration. While Shui QianRou\u2019s cultivation was still shallow and she had only stepped into the small completion of the XianTian realm, the endless and ceaseless sword intent of hers was one that even an individual who did not understand martial arts could understand. Her swordplay was truly like the flowing water!</p><br/><p>In that short instant, the two ladies had already exchanged seventy to eighty moves and were actually evenly matched!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong felt his heart burning with anxiety. Could it be that Rou\u2019er will lose?</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was also filled with anxiousness! Could it be that BingYan has the ability to emerge victorious?! Are the martial arts manuals of Beyond Heavens truly able to defy the heavens?</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s swordplay transformed yet again. It transformed into the boundless ocean and the attacks came endlessly wave after wave.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan let out a light snort and her footwork transformed in response. Her sword danced around like an unfathomable dragon and she was actually able to defend against the endless stream of attacks. The two of them were actually locked in a stalemate at this moment!</p><br/><p>This time, everyone could see the swordplay that Yu BingYan was using.</p><br/><p>This was the Wild Manuscript Calligraphy!</p><br/><p>Victory and defeat would be determined at this moment!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong stood up abruptly and concern could be seen in his eyes. Yu ManLou\u2019s eagle eyes were locked on Yu BingYan\u2019s figure with dark clouds in his eyes!</p><br/><p>The two ladies figures were interwoven with each other and the clanging sound of their swords could be heard. Everyone felt their hearts tense up as they witnessed the intense battle between the two ladies. After a few moments, the figures of the two ladies finally separated.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan held onto her sword with beads of sweat rolling down her head as she panted heavily. Shui QianRou\u2019s face was pale and she was obviously exhausted. Even standing up seemed to be an extremely tiring affair for her and after she trembled for a moment, she collapsed on the ground.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Yu BingYan\u2019s sword left her hand and she fell to the ground\u2026</p><br/><p>Such an outcome truly shocked everyone present!</p><br/><p>They were actually exhausted at the same time!</p><br/><p>It had been a thousand years already! Such circumstances had never happened before!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong immediately felt as though a burden was lifted off his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was stunned on the spot with frustration burning in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen and the eagle-nosed elder from Outside Heavens were also dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>How were they supposed to determine the victor and loser?!</p><br/><p>Looking at the appearance of the two ladies, not to mention continuing the battle, it would probably be difficult for them to even move a finger\u2026</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang was overjoyed and Yu ManTian\u2019s mouth was wide open like a hippopotamus, looking as though he could swallow a cow. A low while later, he finally closed his jaw and his mouth began to cramp up.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Third Master Yu could not control himself from cursing, \u201cWhat\u2026. the\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although everyone found the matter to be extremely puzzling, none of them could see anything wrong with the fight. They could tell that the two ladies had obviously used all of their strength and unleashed all of their killing blows before being thoroughly exhausted. Even the spectators by the side could not help but suck in a breath of cold air on behalf of the two. How was it possible for anyone to know that this was a show that the two of them put on?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t their fault for having poor eyesight either. It was truly because Yu BingYan and Shui QianRou\u2019s show was just too well practiced. Furthermore, they even had the pointers of the number one expert in the world, Justice, and also the aid of Ling Tian who had five thousand years of martial arts heritage behind him. Justice had even admitted himself that if he didn\u2019t know that the two of them were putting up a show, it would be impossible for him to tell with his eyesight. For this grandmaster to admit that he wouldn\u2019t be able to see through the show, it would be impossible for the rest of them present to tell.</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong looked at Yu ManLou in the eyes and said in a low tone, \u201cThis battle shall be regarded as a tie. What does Family Head Yu think about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>From behind Shui ManKong, a loud shout could immediately be heard, \u201cHow can it be regarded as a draw? The ancestral teachings say that the generational battle must end in life or death! The victor will survive and the loser will die! How can it end as a draw?\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who shouted was Shui ManShu. Shui ManPing by his side also voiced out his agreement, \u201cIf we really treat this battle as a draw, wouldn\u2019t we be going against our ancestral teachings?\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

When he had first heard about the Yin Yang Banquet, he had already made up his mind to attend. Now that his cultivation and martial skills had recently broken through, his confidence was through the roof.</p><br/><p>How good a chance was this? Literally every single top expert in the two continents would come and line up during this banquet! If he managed to show his influence and strength on this stage, then in the future, who would dare to speak a single word regarding the matters of the Sky Alliance? This sort of intangible pressure was the greatest asset of a martial artist!</p><br/><p>This was especially so given that they came with a brazen objective, which was to find the HuangFu and Song Family heads. Yes, they had quite a few important matters to discuss with them. That way, they would have sufficient cause to send out their troops and do things more in line with his methods. There was nothing better than that!</p><br/><p>In regards to Ling Jian\u2019s plan, Ling One as well as the other brains of the team were rendered speechless. All of them had their intestines twisted in anxiety. The young noble did mention that when things reached a certain point, they would then look for the two family heads to negotiate and that they were not going to destroy both families this time. However, he did not give a definite timing as to when the \u2018certain point\u2019 was going to be. And neither did he mention that they would have to go to the Shui Family to find them!</p><br/><p>We just needed to look for HuangFu YanHan and Song TianQiao, so why do you have to take the bother to go for the Yin Yang Banquet hosted by the Shui Family and HuangFu Family?! That\u2019s a g*ddamned hornet\u2019s nest! You\u2019re taking too much of a risk, and it outweighs any potential benefits!</p><br/><p>But with Ling Tian not around the base, and furthermore disappearing to the point he was completely unreachable, they couldn\u2019t ask for instructions even if they wanted to! Furthermore, if the young noble was absent, then the next-in-line for command would be Jian\u2019ge! Ling Jian\u2019s eyes lit up at this, and he decided that he was going to use the excuse of this being the most optimal scenario during that point in time. So long as he insisted it was the best method, who would dare argue?!</p><br/><p>If we were to survey the Ling Family comprehensively as a whole, Ling Tian, Ling Chen, and Li Xue were the only ones that Ling Jian viewed as a taboo. The last one was someone whom he recognized in his heart, yet was unwilling to say it out loud. However, since they were not present, then it was akin to when the cat\u2019s away the mice will play! The Sky Alliance\u2019s helm thus became a dictatorship under Ling Jian!</p><br/><p>Therefore, Ling Jian jubilantly passed on the decision to proceed with his plan. There was no choice at all, as those who objected were all viciously beaten up. Those that were not convinced were also beaten till they were thoroughly convinced. This is what Ling Jian called convincing with reason. Then he passed down this threat: If the young noble returned and asked, they all had to say that this matter was discussed and arranged by all of them, with all of them agreeing to it. He as the senior tried to dissuade them, but because they were all so adamant, he had no choice but to also reluctantly follow, so as to protect them if danger befell them\u2026 If anyone happened to say something else other than the script above, then Ling Jian would thrash them!</p><br/><p>Ling One\u2019s , as well as Ling Nineteen\u2019s duo, had to keep quiet out of fear. The trio of Ling One, Two, and Four were well known for being hard-headed inside the Sky Alliance, but in front of Ling Jian, they were akin to pliable clay. As for Nineteen and Twenty, nothing more needed to be said. They could only whisper to themselves, \u201cWhy did this Jian\u2019ge suddenly change to become such a ferocious beast only after a few days of not seeing him? Just that last command of his, if they were to tell others about it, no one would believe it! And to think he said he was experienced and knowledgeable? If young noble were to catch wind of this, his head would have a row of swollen bumps!\u201d</p><br/><p>As such, Ling Jian was able to gallantly strut into the place, and because all the experts in the Shui Family were gathered in the banquet, there was no one that could spot Ling Jian and group as they walked in. Furthermore, Ling Jian even exchanged a few blows with the number one expert of the Shui Family, Shui WuPo, and in two palm strikes, managed to stand arrogantly at the entrance of the Yin Yang Banquet\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat martial skills! May I know your esteemed name?\u201d Shui WuPo\u2019s face turned warm as he praised, looking at Ling Jian. This bloke was not some easy fish, to be able to hit back and forth together with him and not be at a disadvantage. His sword draw was unbelievably quick, his moves crafty, and his movements ghostly. It was on a level he had rarely seen in his entire life! This greatly interested this martial fanatic, or else, given his status, how would he be so polite towards someone who did not possess any qualifications?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate is only a nameless pawn belonging to the Sky Alliance. Under the orders from the three leaders, I\u2019ve come over bearing a verbal message for the family heads of the HuangFu and Shui Families.\u201d Ling Jian stood unafraid and upright, speaking in a deep voice, \u201cMay I know as to whether the two family heads have come to a decision?\u201d</p><br/><p>Among the audience, everyone\u2019s eyes revealed a trace of anger! This was simply arrogance to the point of not putting anyone in his eyes! Strangely, the exception was the Shui Grand Elder, whom eyes flashed a hint of admiration. A person with ability should have such an imposing manner! This old man gives you a thumbs up!</p><br/><p>Both Yu BingYan and Shui QianRou had an odd expression and thought, Isn\u2019t that Ling Jian?! The two ladies did not just spend a day or two in the company of Ling Jian, and just by looking at the figure and tone they were able to easily tell that it was him. On the Yu Family\u2019s side, Yu ManTian twisted his neck from side to side, snorted as he rolled his eyes while looking up, following which he lowered his head and spat on the ground. He scolded, \u201cDammit, this exceeds all logic!\u201d Other than the ladies, he was another one who could tell Ling Jian apart immediately.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou sized up this black-robed masked person in front of him, unknowingly feeling a sense of familiarity! He suddenly recalled that night when the Yu Family had been infiltrated, as well as that peerless martial expert, the pavilion head of the First Pavilion. Be it figure or actions, they all somewhat resembled the pavilion head. It was just that their cultivation realms were too far apart. Even if the previous person had advanced in their cultivation, it did not seem too likely, because the disparity in strength was just too wide\u2026</p><br/><p>As for Yu ManTian who was close to Ling Jian, he naturally could tell that this little bastard was the brat he appreciated the most. This was the reason behind his anger and agitation. What bullsh*t is this? That kid was originally not even a match for me, but look at him now, even this daddy here can\u2019t even serve as his opponent! Now long had it been? To improve at such speed, was there still justice in this world?!!</p><br/><p>Of course, when Yu ManTian\u2019s words fell into the ears of others, it had a different connotation, which was: Even with 600-700 experts here, you still dare to come and cause trouble. Was there any reason left in this world?!</p><br/><p>The four from Beyond Heavens exchanged a glance, before surreptitiously smiling at each other before retaking their seats. They obviously recognized the number one expert under Ling Tian. How could they forget his cruel and vomit-inducing methods of killing? However, the four of them would, of course, choose not to reveal anything. Ever since Justice passed on the Heaven Splitter to Ling Tian, the Beyond Heavens Sect had already been roped inside Ling Tian\u2019s camp. Naturally, the members would not attempt to make things difficult for Ling Tian and company, revealing his classified information.</p><br/><p>To speak the truth, the entire Beyond Heavens Sect was also feeling a little heartache. That was the Heaven Splitter! The identity of the Master of all Under Heavens! To pass on such a tag to Ling Tian, and for him to actually have an expression as though he had been at a disadvantage, caused a few elders in Beyond Heavens to almost vomit blood when they heard about it\u2026</p><br/><p>Another infuriating matter that made everyone want to kill Ling Tian was that instead of using the Heaven Splitter to reap lives, he actually used it to cut stones apart\u2026 This was the Heaven Splitter, mind you!!</p><br/><p>As such, the Beyond Heavens people had a gut full of anger towards Ling Tian! Of course, Ye QingChen\u2019s temper was a little less compared to the rest. This was because he had received plenty of benefits from Ling Tian, and he had dined and feasted to his heart\u2019s content countless times at Ling Tian\u2019s place, even having takeaways!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s words had barely left his mouth, and even HuangFu YanHan and Song TianQiao did not have the chance to speak before a hawk-nosed elder from the Above Heavens side stood up furiously and lambasted, \u201cEgoistical brat! Who do you think you are, to come into this place to cause trouble! Are you looking for death?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian instead laughed mirthlessly, his eyes like two unsheathed sharp swords as they stabbed straight onto the elder\u2019s face. A moment later, he sighed before shaking his head and saying, \u201cOld brat, your standard is too trashy, this daddy here isn\u2019t interested.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hawk-nosed elder felt like vomiting a mouth of blood and fainting on the spot! He could only point a finger and star at Ling Jian with bloodshot eyes, \u201cYouyouyou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian coldly snorted as he stared at HuangFu YanHan and Song TianQiao, drawling, \u201cMy three heads said that they were not very happy with your performance thus far. They will only give you another day to decide whether you want to ally with the Sky Alliance, or to break the ice and disappear! You two had better make your decision on what path to take soon!\u201d His tone was no longer that of negotiation, but rather more of a superior ordering a subordinate. He even ignored the hawk-nosed elder that was off to the side!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was only a single person, yet he held his ground, full of confidence as his eyes swept around the room, not evening putting these 600 experts present in his eyes! In the eyes of bystanders, it was as though Ling Jian had behind him the support of over a thousand troops and soldiers, as well as a monstrous influence backing him!</p><br/><p>The elders from the Yu Family let out cold snorts, about to rush forth, but with a signal from Yu ManLou, they immediately snapped out of their fury, sitting back down. The black-robed man had trespassed into the Shui Family\u2019s courtyard this time, and furthermore was only looking for trouble with the Song and HuangFu Families. The more they fought, the better it would be for the Yu Family! Naturally, Yu ManLou would not allow his own people to stand up for the two families.</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong\u2019s expression darkened, as he coldly spoke, \u201cYou\u2019re from the Sky Alliance?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s black robes fluttered as though dissolving the aura of Shui ManKong\u2019s anger, as he coldly retorted, \u201cYou\u2019re the Shui Family Head, Shui ManKong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat guts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAudacious!\u201d</p><br/><p>The various members of the Shui Family immediately showed their discontent.</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong waved his hand, a look of deep contemplation on his face as he spoke, \u201cWith your current level of martial arts, how could you merely be a nameless pawn? Could it be that inside the Sky Alliance, you\u2019re actually not one of the heads?!\u201d Shui ManKong had begun to put up his guard. From his tone, one could immediately infer that this person was indeed here on orders! This mysterious person had skills that were no less than the Shui Family\u2019s number one expert Shui WuPo, but with such unrivaled skills, he was merely an underling! If that was the case, then to what extent had the abilities of the three heads reached? The more he thought about it, the more he realized that he was drenched in cold sweat! Shui ManKong\u2019s voice could not help but carry a few more hints of politeness.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian only smiled coldly in response, \u201cI have fulfilled my orders, so this subordinate will first bid farewell!\u201d Shui ManKong was, in the end, Shui QianRou\u2019s father, and with her already being recognized as a partner of Ling Tian, Shui ManKong could be said to be Ling Tian\u2019s father-in-law. As such, even with Ling Jian\u2019s natural arrogance, he did not dare to disrespect him. Thus, he did not flaunt his words of \u2018Your father\u2019 here and there!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian swept his black robes to the side, preparing to leave. In actual fact, he was extremely disappointed. During the confrontation, he could already see that while there were experts aplenty, no one really wished to take action. This might be the Shui Family\u2019s territory, but in the hearts of the two families, the upcoming battle between themselves was more important compared to himself!</p><br/><p>The remainder aside, the Beyond Heavens Sect would definitely not make a move. Whether the Above Heavens Sect made a move or stayed put did not matter, as Ling Jian saw with a glance that none of them was his match at all! Even if the three of them were to go against him, he could take them together. There would be no meaning in such a battle! If so, then what was the point in him staying?</p><br/><p>Anyways, since his main objective was already met. That was utter deterrence! After this matter was over, even if the Shui Family wished to oppose the Sky Alliance, they would still have to weigh the benefits properly! For someone like Ling Jian, who was able to go head on with Shui WuPo without any disadvantage, could be said to be as rare as phoenix feathers and qilin horns. In fact, their numbers probably could not even add up to five fingers on a hand! These were people that could not and should not be provoked!</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Shui WuPo suddenly shot out, \u201cIt won\u2019t be too late to leave after fighting once with me!\u201d His eyes were filled with the excitement of meeting an equal!</p><br/><p>\u201cSou!\u201d Ling Jian\u2019s rising body suddenly shot back down, floating slightly above the ground. With his body inclined forward, he drew out his sword and cut down. Shui WuPo retaliated by stabbing out, and as both swords neared, Shui WuPo\u2019s sword seemed to split into three and then another three, forming nine exquisite sword blossoms as they intersected each other, surrounding Ling Jian completely!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood move!\u201d Ling Jian shouted out, before violently waving the black iron sword in his hand. With a loud hum, a resplendent white ray of light lit up before everyone\u2019s eyes. This was actually sword energy that had been fully materialized, turning into something akin to a wall in midair!</p><br/><p>The nine sword blossoms from Shui WuPo\u2019s sword pierced the wall of sword light, urged on with the full strength of his cultivation!</p><br/><p>A loud explosion was heard before the sound akin to tinkling glass rang out. The white wall of sword light had shattered like a huge piece of glass, but yet there was nothing physical on the floor.</p><br/><p>The black-robed man originally standing at the door had already disappeared. Shui WuPo\u2019s sword had already been sheathed, and he was standing at the doorstep, with a crestfallen expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand Elder, how are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui WuPo\u2019s eyes were fixed on a certain direction outside the room, and his expression fluctuated irregularly, before he suddenly shouted loudly, \u201cAfter the generational battles, I wish to fight properly with you! Do you agree?!\u201d</p><br/><p>From afar floated a cold and monotonous voice, \u201cIf you\u2019re still alive three days later, it won\u2019t be too late to make an appointment. Better change your sword first, though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui WuPo snorted in reply before turning to walk back to his place. However, a clattering sound suddenly rang out from his sword sheath, causing his face to change greatly. His hand immediately darted to the sword hilt and tugged it out, only to see that the sword hilt was all that was left of his sword!</p><br/><p>His sword sheath slipped out of his hand and dropped on the floor. With a series of tinkling sounds, more than ten pieces of broken sword shards scattered all over the floor. Under the glare of the lights, it resembled the stars in a night sky, shining like a pair of bright eyes.</p><br/><p>Everyone instantly gasped in shock. At the exact point when they crossed swords, the opponent actually managed to shatter Shui WuPo\u2019s sword into bits! No wonder he would say, \u201cBetter change your sword first, though!\u201d As it turned out, the sword in that black-robed man\u2019s hand was actually a rarely seen peerless weapon!</p><br/><p>Everyone was aware that Shui WuPo had always stuck to using the most ordinary steel sword, because based on his own words, so long as his martial arts reached an extreme, even a flying petal or a floating leaf could all turn into peerless instruments of slaughter! However, today\u2019s episode totally changed the mindset of Shui WuPo at this moment.</p><br/><p>Looking at the strewn shards of his sword on the ground, Shui WuPo suddenly burst into laughter. He laughed long and hard, and waved his hand, causing all the shards to vanish. He returned back to his seat and calmly sat down, with a neutral expression, as though nothing had ever happened.</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan and Song TianQiao\u2019s expressions looked like sh*t. The duo never thought that even after reaching the most restricted area in the Shui Family, the Sky Alliance would still dare to come looking for them. Furthermore, they even chose to come knocking in such a brazen and arrogant manner, before easily leaving unimpeded!</p><br/><p>If that was the case, then even though the land below the heavens was vast, where would be a safe place for them to hide? There was nowhere! Could it be that they had to watch their hundred-odd years of foundations destroyed in their very own hands?!</p><br/><p>If they did not wish to be vanquished, then could it be that they had to surrender? Forever living as subordinates under someone, to be ordered around like mules?</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan and Song TianQiao glanced at each other, seeing the bitterness in each other\u2019s eyes. That was the bitter sensation of impending doom, but unable to do anything to prevent it!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou, on the other hand, had a contemplative expression on his face. Could it be that his conjecture was wrong? This person might not be the First Pavilion Head, but their martial arts obviously looked like they were from the same sect. This point was undeniable. Following this conjecture, could it be then that the First Pavilion actually did not belong to Ling Tian? And was actually the asset of the Sky Alliance? He himself had long heard of the fame of the Sky Alliance, but all along he simply treated them as an upstart. However, it seemed now that this bunch of upstarts actually possessed enough influence to change the playing field in the Heavenly Wind Continent! Actually, the strength the Sky Alliance now possessed could be said to be above that of the Shui Family with a millennium of accumulation. If they were to combine with the mysterious First Pavilion\u2026</p><br/><p>Could it be that in this great showdown of vying for supremacy, he had to add the Sky Alliance as another one of his opponents?</p><br/><p>The more he thought along this line, the more Yu ManLou started to panic and be filled with anxiety. As for whatever was mentioned in the meeting after, he basically did not pay the least bit of attention, and it was only after he realized that everyone was staring at him did he realize that the banquet had already begun.</p><br/><p>What followed next was the opponents who were supposed to face each other would come up and offer a toast to each other. This wine was termed as the Dissolving Grudges Wine, and after toasting and downing this cup, no matter who died in whose hands, there would be no grudges nor hatred. Life and death would be completely based on your own capabilities, as well as fate.</p><br/><p>Under everyone\u2019s gazes, two similarly heaven toppling beauties both cradled their wine cups as they stood up. Their eyes locked, and they stated their intentions at the same time, lifting their heads to down the cup in one go.</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong\u2019s eyes twinkled as he smiled, \u201cBrother Yu, is that your niece BingYan? Indeed a beauty, an outstanding one among her peers too!\u201d Shui ManKong had long found out that his daughter\u2019s opponent this time, the little princess of the Yu Family, was actually a cripple that could not learn martial arts. However, sweeping a glance at her showed that the lady was actually full of spirit, and even possessed a demeanor similar to that of a first-rate expert. Just how was this supposed to be a cripple? Even if one started to practice martial arts since they were young, it was still a momentous task to reach such a level! She was completely not inferior to even his daughter, Shui QianRou, whom he was proudest of!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, this is my humble niece Yu BingYan. BingYan, why are you still not greeting Uncle Shui?\u201d Yu ManLou naturally knew what was going on in Shui ManKong\u2019s mind, but he was not worried at all. He even cast a look of disdain towards Shui MaKong as he thought, \u2018My niece came this time to give her life away, what are you so afraid of?!\u2019 However, how could Yu ManLou have foreseen that concern breeds confusion? Shui ManKong actually intended to send his daughter back to Heavenly Star after the battles this time, for her to stay and live together with Ling Tian. How could he allow his daughter to be in such danger?!</p></div>\n</div>"}

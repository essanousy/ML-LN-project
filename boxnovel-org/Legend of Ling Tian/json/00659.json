Right after Justice carried Shui WuBo\u2019s body away, Yu ManLou had collapsed onto the ground unconscious. After the experts under Yu ManLou took him away to take a rest, they left without witnessing the final mixed battle.</p><br/><p>They estimated that Yu ManLou had probably escaped to the pier at that moment, leaving on the boat immediately\u2026</p><br/><p>He left without the slightest bit of hesitation!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s judgment was truly admirable.</p><br/><p>He did not consider whether or not Justice had spotted anything and did not dream that Justice would die from the venom in Shui WuBo\u2019s body. He made plans for the worst possible scenario and left immediately. He could not even be bothered about what would happen to his Yu Family in Heavenly Wind\u2026</p><br/><p>There was another possibility: Yu ManLou decided to leave the moment he saw Justice! Because Justice was one of the few in the world who had the strength to threaten Yu ManLou! The moment he realized something was wrong, he left without any hesitation and refused to take the slightest bit of risk!</p><br/><p>Resolute! This was the demeanor of an ambitious character!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian and Justice stood by the pier with worry on their faces.</p><br/><p>With this sudden change in the war for hegemony, the two of them felt their hearts turn heavy. With Yu ManLou leaving today, it would be difficult to find another chance to deal with him!</p><br/><p>\u201cWith things turning out this way, the only option available would be for us to defeat all of Yu ManLou\u2019s forces and force him into a corner before killing him with a single blow!\u201d Ling Tian said with a low tone, \u201cThis is probably the only way left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, we can also assassinate him!\u201d Ling Jian said with a serious expression, \u201cIf the few of us brothers join hands, I believe that we will be able to get rid of Yu ManLou!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must not!\u201d Justice and Ling Tian shouted together. Ling Tian looked at Ling Jian with a deep gaze. \u201cAh Jian, my previous judgment of Yu ManLou was insufficient. If I really allow you to try to assassinate him, I believe that even if all of you are able to successfully assassinate him, not a single one of you would be able to return alive! If the price of me ruling over the world is the lives of my brothers, then I rather allow Yu ManLou to rule over the world! Unless\u2026 I take action personally!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, no!\u201d The rims of Ling Jian\u2019s eyes turned red and he quickly turned around to prevent the two others from seeing the tears in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the price of me ruling over the world is the lives of my brothers, then I would rather allow Yu ManLou to rule over the world.\u201d Justice repeated those words and lamented, \u201cLing Tian, from the beginning to the end, I always thought that you were no different from Yu ManLou with your ambitious character and vicious means. In that case, regardless of who gains the world, it wouldn\u2019t be anything good for the commoners of the world. But after hearing the words \u2018unless I take action personally\u2019 from you, I finally understand that I have underestimated you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu ManLou wants to gain the world under his command even if he has to sacrifice his parents and family members. Anyone who blocks his way will be killed without mercy. In order to achieve his goals, apart from sacrificing his life, he is willing to sacrifice anything else! However, you, Ling Tian, are different. You have so many things that you aren\u2019t willing to give up. I am beginning to believe in you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a desolate smile. \u201cI never wanted to be a hero or become an ambitious individual. After all, it is too tiring to be a hero and there are far too many restrictions. An ambitious individual is too lonely and it is difficult for an ambitious individual to have family and trusted aides! There are far too many people in the world that I cannot abandon. Like my brothers, my family, and my women!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sighed as he lamented, \u201cI have far too many weaknesses for my enemies to target and so I cannot allow them to find out my weaknesses. Currently, everyone including you thinks that I, Ling Tian, am an ambitious character! When dealing with an ambitious character like Ling Tian, it would be useless to threaten him with his kin. As long as he is alive, there would definitely be endless troubles! I must attract all of their attention to myself. This is also something that I wanted!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like your acting skills are truly fantastic.\u201d Justice could not help but laugh, \u201cIt is truly a good idea for you to act like an ambitious character.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t an act!\u201d Ling Tian said with a serious expression, \u201cIt is truly more comfortable to be an ambitious character as compared to being a hero. I can do whatever I wish to and that is the most delightful way to live! Justice, do you think that a hero does not wish to do as they wish?\u201d Ling Tian burst out laughing, \u201cThey also wish to do so but they are entrapped by their title of being a \u2018hero\u2019! They have to suppress their desires and are unable to do as they wish. Can that still be considered a hero? They are just pitiful bugs!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA hero should be rated on whether or not his deeds benefited the entire world and not his means!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA false gentleman will never be a hero! If they cannot even do as they wish freely, how can they be considered a hero?\u201d Ling Tian burst out laughing, \u201cI am numb to killing and my methods are sinister. I will not treat my enemies with mercy and will wipe them out by the roots! When fighting for hegemony, I will resort to any means possible and scheme against the various aristocratic families! However, I have never harmed the commoners of the world! I have only killed those who deserved to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I am an ambitious character, when I unite the world and bring peace to the commoners, who would not say that I am a hero? Of all the monarchs in history, which one of them would be heroes to the very end? Not a single one! Not even half a monarch! If they continue leading a \u2018heroic\u2019 life, not a single one of them would be able to survive to the very end, not to mention ascending to the throne!\u201d Ling Tian turned around to look at Justice, \u201cDetermining who the hero is from one\u2019s actions? Only your Beyond Heavens would make such casual judgments!\u201d</p><br/><p>For the first time, Justice was rendered speechless. He never imagined that a casual joke of his would incite such a long speech from Ling Tian. But as he thought about it carefully, Ling Tian\u2019s words did indeed make sense.</p><br/><p>\u201cHero? Ambitious character?\u201d Justice muttered under his breath as he looked up at the sky.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it is time for Beyond Heavens to be disbanded, Justice thought to himself in his heart.</p><br/><p>The generational battle between the Shui and Yu Families was over but the storm in Heavenly Wind had only started to brew. The flags of the Sky Alliance were already fluttering proudly all around the continent. At the same time, the war for authority in the Shui Family had also begun!</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo\u2019s death had greatly affected the strength of the already dwindling side branch of the Shui Family. Just when the conflict between the two factions was extremely intense, Ling Tian appeared in the great hall of the Shui Family with his men!</p><br/><p>After witnessing Justice\u2019s departure like a free swallow, Ling Tian made his way to the Shui Family together with Ling Jian. With the generational battle over, the members of the Yu Family were packing up and getting ready to leave. Yu BingYan was naturally not part of this group.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had pondered about whether he should inform Yu ManTang and Yu ManTian about Yu ManLou cultivating an evil martial art. But after long consideration, Ling Tian decided to remain silent about it. With Yu ManTian\u2019s character, he would definitely interrogate Yu ManLou the moment he learned of this. At the same time, Yu ManTian would probably be the first to die in Yu ManLou\u2019s hands as well. At that time, Ling Tian would only be harming Yu ManTian.</p><br/><p>As for Yu ManTang, Ling Tian had only briefly mentioned it to him. Ling Tian only briefly mentioned that Yu ManLou\u2019s martial art was extremely evil with a heavy sigh of anger. After that, he did not say another word.</p><br/><p>With Yu ManTang\u2019s wisdom, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for him to guess why Ling Tian was beating about the bush. However, Yu ManTang hid everything in his heart and pretended that he did not hear or understand anything. After all, their Yu Family still has to survive from now on. Before the world was united as one, large aristocratic families such as the Yu and Shui Families would not disappear.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian had already made a decision in his heart. The moment peace is restored to the world and there are no longer wars, Ling Tian would not allow families like the Yu, Shui, and Xiao to continue being the local tyrants of their region!</p><br/><p>Before that day arrives, everything was just empty words.</p><br/><p>With regards to the authority of the Shui Family, Ling Tian had a long conversation with Shui ManKong. Ling Tian felt that since they intended to cleanse the Shui Family out of all oppositions, they should do it thoroughly.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had openly proclaimed his intention to unleash a massacre in the Shui Family. If the cleansing only happened with water, it would only be a matter of time before a relapse happens. The moment a relapse happened, it would be a tragedy for the Shui Family! Only by using the sharpest and reddest blood to cleanse the Shui Family would they be able to ensure that no relapse would occur!</p><br/><p>Being overly merciful would never allow one to accomplish anything!</p><br/><p>The only reason why the Shui Family ended up in its miserable straits was because of Shui ManKong\u2019s mercy! Even if he hated his enemy to the bone, he could not bear to uproot his enemies from the root.</p><br/><p>With regards to his character, Ling Tian was completely speechless. No wonder his daughter and son would think of going to Heavenly Star in an attempt to save their family.</p><br/><p>Helpless, Ling Tian could only agree to Shui ManKong\u2019s request. As long as Shui ManShu was wise enough, Ling Tian would only kill a few individuals to scare him. Upon hearing that, Shui ManKong felt a burden being lifted off his shoulders and quickly agreed.</p><br/><p>A pity Shui ManKong was wrong.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had already predicted that Shui ManShu and his gang would definitely not be wise. They wouldn\u2019t shed tears if they didn\u2019t see the coffin!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had already decided that regardless of Shui ManKong\u2019s choice, all of them would have to die!</p><br/><p>Indeed, Shui ManShu, Shui ManPing, and the others were even more foolish than Ling Tian had expected! Their words and actions went completely overboard and they were like beasts struggling in a cage!</p><br/><p>In Ling Jian\u2019s words, \u201cEven if a coffin is in front of these people, they won\u2019t be able to stop themselves from jumping into the coffin to test it out!\u201d</p><br/><p>The intense argument from within the Shui Family\u2019s hall was one that could be heard from even a mile away. This made Ling Tian who was seated in the side hall extremely impatient. This was originally a problem that could be easily solved with a simple massacre but Shui ManKong and Shui QianRou were both vehemently against that idea. However, these two individuals were people who Ling Tian had no choice but to show some face to.</p><br/><p>Both father and daughter felt that after Shui WuBo\u2019s and Shui ManCheng\u2019s death, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult for them to wrestle back the authority within the family. However, they never expected Shui ManShu and Shui ManPing would gather all of the Elders to question and provoke their authority.</p><br/><p>The \u2018incompetence\u2019 of the Shui Family had always been Shui ManKong\u2019s biggest flaw and Shui ManKong was also blamed for the internal mess within the Shui Family. In their mouths, everything that went wrong in the Shui Family was a result of their Family Head\u2019s incompetence and their family head should give up his seat!</p><br/><p>As such, emotions flared up and all the Elders of the Shui Family demanded that Shui ManKong fulfill the promise he made before the generational battle and give up all authority in the family before receiving the punishment of the family! The Elders in Shui ManKong\u2019s faction naturally refused to back down but were inferior in number. With the argument growing more and more intense, all of their faces flushed red and it seemed as though a chaotic battle was about to break out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Is this the thousand-year-old Shui Family or is this a market?\u201d Why does it seem like I came to the wrong place?\u201d A young voice sounded with disdain in his voice. While the voice wasn\u2019t loud, everyone in the hall could hear his voice despite the commotion. Furthermore, every one of them felt as though that young voice was directed at them.</p><br/><p>Just what kind of cultivation would be required? Just what kind of means did this individual have? After losing their number one expert, how could the Shui Family not be shocked!</p><br/><p>The entire hall immediately fell silent and everyone turned to look at the door.</p><br/><p>The door was opened and a young white-robed teen was standing outside the door with a smile on his face. At the same time, his eyes were filled with unconcealed disdain. Behind him, there were a couple of white-robed men standing upright in an orderly fashion. However, right at this moment, everyone in the hall could only see Ling Tian and not anyone else.</p><br/><p>Just like on a night with a full moon, regardless of how many stars there are in the sky, everyone\u2019s attention would immediately be captured by the moon the moment they look up at the sky! The brightest moon!</p><br/><p>This foreign white-robed teen was like the full moon in the sky!</p><br/><p>He was like a gigantic magnet attracting all of their gazes.</p><br/><p>By Shui ManKong\u2019s side, the eyes of the originally enraged Shui QianRou lit up immediately and she was overjoyed. With regards to the stunning effect that he created, Shui QianRou only felt pride! This is my beloved man! My beloved man who loves me!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Why do you dare to barge into my Shui Family\u2019s residence! Do you want to become enemies with my Shui Family?\u201d A middle-aged man asked with a solemn expression. He was Shui ManShu.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian! He is Ling Tian from the Ling Family!\u201d A young man cried out with a flustered expression. The one who cried out was Shui QianHai who saw Ling Tian back in Heavenly Star.</p><br/><p>Everyone was startled!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian, one of the two hegemons in Heavenly Star capable of being a match for Yu ManLou. He was also the widely known number one demon of killing who brought five individuals to fight his way through a million soldiers. To think that such a character would appear before their eyes!</p><br/><p>Of course, Ling Tian was also widely known for something else that everyone had already forgotten: He was the number one profligate son in Sky Bearing\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it is the arrival of young noble Ling. Please forgive this Shui for not receiving you.\u201d Shui ManYun cupped his hands and said with a smile. At the same time, he grumbled in his heart, One hegemon has just left and another is here again. For these two opponents of Heavenly Star to appear in Heavenly Wind at the same time, could it be a coincidence? Furthermore, what is Ling Tian\u2019s purpose for visiting Heavenly Wind?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2019Jian, was the one who spoke to this young noble Family Head Shui ManKong?\u201d Ling Tian raised his head up slightly pretending as though he could not hear Shui ManYun\u2019s words. Since he was here to seek trouble with them, how would he treat them politely?</p><br/><p>\u201cReporting to young noble, I heard that Family Head Shui is a heroic figure with an imposing disposition. A figure like him with a cunning pair of eyes would never be the family head of the Shui Family. At the very most, he can only belong to someone from the side branch. Someone like him will never have the rights to be a direct descendant of the family. Young noble, I am truly sorry! We would not have any information on such a figure. May young noble forgive me.\u201d Ling Jian rubbed his head and replied respectfully. Ling Jian naturally knew how to work together with his young noble to blow things up. After all, if he didn\u2019t blow things up and a fight didn\u2019t break out, wouldn\u2019t he have nothing to do?</p><br/><p>\u201cA figure like you dares to talk instead of the Shui family head? Is this the way a thousand-year-old family treats its guests?\u201d Ling Tian bellowed in anger before looking at Ling Jian, \u201cAre you becoming stupid? Why are you not chasing trash like him away? You made this young noble waste my saliva for no good reason!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis subordinate is in the wrong. This subordinate will do so immediately.\u201d Ling Jian acted like a flustered subordinate.</p><br/><p>As Shui ManYun heard the conversation of the two individuals, he was almost angered to death! His body trembled from head to toe with his previously fair face turning ashen from anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat who\u2026 I am sorry, I don\u2019t know your name,\u201d Ling Jian said apologetically but not a tinge of apology could be seen on his face. \u201cMy young noble wants to talk to your family head. Please step aside. Even if you are from the side branch, you are still a disciple of an aristocratic family. Why don\u2019t you know the basic rules? If this happened in the Ling Family, you would definitely be beaten to death for your crimes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui ManYun finally exploded! This wasn\u2019t the way to bully someone! His lips were trembling and even his tone changed, \u201cLing Tian! You actually dare to act in such an arrogant manner?! Even a slave of yours dares to humiliate an important member of my Shui Family? So what if you are a hegemon in Heavenly Star? We are now in Heavenly Wind and in the premises of the Shui Family! My status would only be higher than your Ling Family! What right do you have to say such words? What right do you have to humiliate me as such? If you do not give me a reason, my Shui Family will not let you off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian lowered his head and snapped his fingers. With a frown, he did not even lift his head up to look at Shui ManYun, \u201cReason? Not letting me off? Even a character like you can be considered an important member of the Shui Family? You can actually represent the Shui Family? What a fool! If the Shui Family is filled with characters like you, you are truly tarnishing the name of a thousand-year-old family!\u201d</p><br/><p>From Shui ManYun\u2019s faction, seven to eight elders stormed out angrily. \u201cLittle junior! Do you know the price of humiliating my Shui Family?! You are going to pay a price for your arrogance today!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

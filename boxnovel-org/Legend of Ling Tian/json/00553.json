Inside, Ling Chen had already warily opened her eyes as she sat up, \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>In a weird voice, Ling Tian cackled, \u201cLittle Beautiful, it\u2019s me. I\u2019m the serial flower thief, here to \u2018pick your beautiful flower\u2019 <sup>1</sup> , you had better not resist.\u201d Like a hungry tiger pouncing on its food, he immediately pinned the svelte body below his own, his two hands moving naturally on instinct to attack the defences, conquering the land until he reached the highest twin peaks. Ling Chen let out a yelp. She had already recognized Ling Tian\u2019s voice a long time ago, and was overjoyed yet embarrassed, so how could she retaliate?</p><br/><p>Following Ling Tian\u2019s ever brazen reactions, Ling Chen could only begin to moan as her body melted into Ling Tian\u2019s embrace. She opened her mouth with difficulty, as though wanting to say something, but Ling Tian was prepared and immediately sealed her tiny mouth with his. It was as though her brain got short-circuited, her entire self lost within the passionate kiss of her lover who she had not seen for a long time. Ling Tian\u2019s hands did not stop moving though, removing all the articles of clothing with a practiced hand, and the moment Ling Chen recovered her senses, she found out that her body was without a single thread, and under the demonic grip of her loved one, it was already trembling non stop\u2026</p><br/><p>Striving to keep her amorous eyes open, she held on to the offending hand that was currently around her chest, and pouted with a red face, \u201cYoung Noble is too hasty\u2026 Sister Yan is still by the side, and this is a really inconvenient time\u2026.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian received a shock, and his busy hands suddenly froze as he stretched his head out for a look. On the other side of the bed was precisely Yu BingYan, who was deep in sleep with slow breaths\u2026 as though she was not disturbed by Ling Tian\u2019s arrival\u2026.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face turned bitter, \u201cMy good Chen\u2019er, I\u2019ve\u2026 for four months now\u2026\u201d Ling Chen could only nestle embarrassedly on his chest as she whispered, \u201cHow about\u2026 we go to your room?\u201d</p><br/><p>In great joy, Ling Tian gave her ample chest a vigourous rub, before lowering his head and latching onto her lips as he mumbled, \u201cThis lady Ling Chen is indeed an agreeable person. Looks like this flower thief today will definitely get to pick your flower! My luck with women is indeed not a shallow one, hehehehe\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen could only let out a lovable moan as she gripped tightly on Ling Tian, breathing heavily as she replied, \u201cYoung Noble\u2026 Ling Chen has always belonged to young noble\u2026 since you want to pick my flower, then you can pick it however you want\u2026 Chen\u2019er also wants\u2026 young noble\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence was like a potent aphrodisiac, for Ling Tian immediately felt the blood in his entire blood rage, and he grunted, \u201cThen I\u2019ll not be courteous for today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s face turned redder, and her arms circled around his neck as she closed her eyes and moaned, \u201c\u2026.up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a low laugh, Ling Tian exerted some strength to carry Ling Chen, and vanished in another instant.</p><br/><p>On the bed, Yu BingYan\u2019s lashes suddenly trembled, as though wanting to open, and her face immediately started to turn a brilliant shade of red. What was she dreaming about? However, she suddenly flipped, and pulled the blanket over her head\u2026. It seems like this lass was actually dishonest about about sleeping soundly\u2026.</p><br/><p>Only late the next morning did our great noble Ling walk out of his room feeling extremely refreshed. He squinted his eyes towards the sun, comfortably stretching out his waist as he let out a brilliant smile.</p><br/><p>After living four months like a celibate, Ling Tian, as well as little Ling Tian, felt almost stifled to death. Last night, regardless of Ling Chen\u2019s protests and pleas, Ling Tian had wantonly ravaged her repeatedly, with the result being Ling Chen was still dead asleep on the bed even with such a profound cultivation, her body completely bereft of energy.</p><br/><p>Recalling Ling Chen\u2019s bashful fawning yesterday, Ling Tian suddenly felt his little brother jump up in excitement once again, and almost could not resist the temptation to return back to the room and begin another round immediately. He quickly breathed deeply, suppressing the heat in his abdomen. He found it depressing how his lust was raging more and more out of control in the recent times. In the past, there used to be such occurrences, but so long as he practiced the reverse sutra for his Divine Shocking Dragon Formula, then he could calm his emotions down. However, he found out that even if he could suppress it like so, the next flare up would be far more intense.</p><br/><p>He could only smile wryly to himself. If this were to go on, then his rule of having one wife would definitely be impossible. This was because one woman right now was definitely unable to take his vigorous stamina and strength. Just look at Ling Chen\u2019s situation. A day or two might seem possible, but a long period of time would only harm her body, and even with Ling Chen\u2019s strengthened constitution, she still could not take it, let alone others.</p><br/><p>Luckily I\u2019ve transmigrated to another life! Ling Tian resentfully thought. If it was the past him, he would only be able to marry one wife, and most likely, there would be no woman who would be able to endure this stamina, likely making him end up as a bachelor. It was better for him to have transmigrated!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s sensitive hearing next picked up a group of footsteps walking past. One pair hurried by, followed by another, then a next, as though they could not stand still.</p><br/><p>Nobody knew why there was now a cordoned off courtyard beside the secret chamber, but nobody raised any issues, as though it was a common occurrence.</p><br/><p>From afar came two other rushing over, and their conversation traveled into Ling Tian\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Tie, I heard that the new God of Wealth is not a simple character at all. Are you sure your side is fine? I just saw Old Qian and the rest walking out with an expression as though their mother just died, they must have been criticized the whole time, hahaha, how satisfying!\u201d A voice full of schadenfreude sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, who knows.\u201d Another helpless voice sounded, \u201cYou really have it easy, just requiring you to check out how many blades are freshly produced everyday, write a few strokes on the accounts and that\u2019s it. I\u2019m in big trouble, being the supervisor for one side of revenue and grain supply. The nitty gritty details can already destroy me, and I\u2019m hoping that this God of Wealth will go easy on me. Hais!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t get into trouble, who doesn\u2019t know that you, Old Tie, have always done things in a meticulous manner? Relax, you should be fine!\u201d Though the words sounded like reassurance, the tone of the voice was as though the person was awaiting a good show.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k your mom! You want to see me make a fool of myself! Dream on!\u201d The other guy ruthlessly cursed.</p><br/><p>Their voices grew fainter, and the first person seemed to have said something, followed by huge roars of laughter before they entered the secret chamber.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian finally realized that Xiao YanXue had finally started her job as the new financial controller. It seemed like those helpers in charge of running their businesses for him were in for some trouble. As the saying went, the new boss cracks the whip three times <sup>2</sup> , and our dear Miss Xiao had only cracked her whip once so far!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian pursed up his mouth as he thought, This girl really acts fast.</p><br/><p>He had to admit that this sort of swift and decisive reaction was something he admired. However, this could also be attributed to the fact that Xiao YanXue had left her post for quite an extended period, which made her hands a little itchy. Right now, after assuming her old trade, she would definitely be full of vigor, and with this being the foundation of her loved one Ling Tian, Xiao YanXue would definitely show more effort.</p><br/><p>But if that was the case, then this group of supervisors were in for a \u2018treat\u2019! YanXue\u2019s profession could not be hidden, and was not inferior in any aspect to his own mother, with some parts even surpassing her. While the supervisors mentioned about tidying up the accounts before hand, with some even better than the accountants themselves, there were still quite a few uneducated people who were placed in charge as the business expanded. Thus, Ling Tian could be sure that quite a few of them would walk out with swollen faces, oh, a good example would be that Old Tie that just went in\u2026</p><br/><p>Only by passing through Xiao YanXue\u2019s reorganization could the messy finances of the Ling Family Courtyard become stable and official. Ling Tian could imagine the type of foundation he was setting up, that what sort of huge benefits he could reap after the huge amount of finances, grain and military supplies went through Xiao YanXue\u2019s magical hands.</p><br/><p>What Ling Tian was unaware of was that ever since he set down this command, Xiao YanXue who was seated in the secret chamber had almost been frightened out of her wits! Never in her dreams did she imagine that Ling Tian\u2019s strength had already grown to such a frightening state in the dark! Even she who was used to huge sums of money, was still overwhelmed with shock at the accounts!</p><br/><p>The preparations made in all four directions by the Ling Family Courtyard was just on the surface. The fully compiled report made Xiao YanXue totally dumbfounded, unable to imagine that Ling Tian\u2019s subordinates could actually have such an efficient and fast method to gather resources, already outstripping even the Xiao Family\u2019s by more than half!</p><br/><p>However, what made her the most confused was that even with the crazy accumulation of wealth, as well as the immense project that was ongoing, there was actually no proper system of doing things as well as an extraordinarily messy accounting! In her eyes, it was as though a swarm of bees were doing work. They did not even separate the revenues from the expenditure, placing them together, and as for splitting by departments, don\u2019t even go there!</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue always thought that in order to rake in wealth, one had to have a huge brain behind everything, as well as many talents working together to create this miracle. She could not fathom just how Ling Tian had managed to rely on these riff-raffs to create such a huge family property!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, she had merely skimmed through the surface. The more frightening part was that within all the messy accounts, revenue and expenses, there was actually no signs of embezzlement present. Even with the influence of the Xiao Family, as well as the various talents under them, coupled with Xiao YanXue\u2019s talent, they too found it hard to prevent any form of embezzlement. Xiao YanXue was sure that embezzlement of funds was something impossible to prevent, and so long as it wasn\u2019t too obvious, they could let it slip. However, for Ling Tian\u2019s subordinates, such messy accounting was as good as a god-sent opportunity for them to get filthy rich, and yet, there was no such incidents happening.</p><br/><p>This was something impossible!!!!</p></div>\n</div>"}

As for Ling Chen, she is my\u2026\u201d talking about Ling Chen, Ling Tian\u2019s eyes were filled with warmth as he recalled the beautiful memories with her. I have not seen that lass for such a long time already. I wonder if she is doing well. Will she cry when thinking about me? I really want to go back immediately\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Li Xue let out a long breath and her eyes formed a crescent shape, \u201cNo wonder! I was thinking too far. Thankfully you are not\u2026\u201d Thinking about her previous ridiculous thoughts, Li Xue felt extremely amused and began to burst out laughing uncontrollably, \u201cHahaha\u2026 how funny\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian looked at the two of them with a puzzled expression, not knowing what Li Xue was laughing about. Could it be that my expression was too strict and I scared her silly?</p><br/><p>However, he did not know that this lady\u2019s strength should not be estimated. She definitely didn\u2019t place the First Pavilion Head, number one assassin in the world, Ling Jian, in her eyes!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could not help but also chuckle helplessly, \u201cShe is a crazy lass.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian came to a realization and said, \u201cNo wonder. What a pity, what a pity. What a waste of her beautiful looks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean about pity? I do not need you to evaluate my looks!\u201d Li Xue stopped laughing and scolded fiercely. At this moment, she could already predict that if she wanted to follow by Ling Tian\u2019s side, this cold block of wood would definitely be the biggest obstruction to her. To think that he would even feel jealous on behalf of his younger sister\u2026</p><br/><p>He isn\u2019t Jing WuMing indeed! Because Jing WuMing would never behave in such a manner!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian looked at her calmly and shut his eyes. Since his young noble said that she was a crazy lass, it meant that she must definitely be a crazy lass. What was the point of bickering with a crazy lass?</p><br/><p>Seeing the both of them bickering for no good reason, Ling Tian quickly changed the topic, \u201cIn your trip to the Yu Residence, you have seen the true strength of the Yu Family. What are your thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ling Tian\u2019s question, Ling Jian opened his eyes and thought for a moment before replying solemnly, \u201cPowerful! They are powerful to the point I shuddered in fear. I think that I will never have the courage to enter the Yu Residence again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are powerful indeed,\u201d Ling Tian agreed, \u201cI tried to overestimated the strength of the Yu Family but never expected that I actually underestimated them still. To think that they still have such a large strength being concealed. Thankfully, you unknowingly exposed their hidden strength in this trip of yours. If this trump card were to be revealed when our armies are facing each other and we do not make the proper preparations\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Ling Jian said unblinkingly, \u201cWe must definitely remove this hidden strength of the Yu Family as early as possible. Young noble only need to give the command and I will lead my brothers to execute them all. Rest assured young noble, we will only take action after ensuring a foolproof plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFoolproof plan?! How would it be so simple?\u201d Ling Tian smiled, \u201cNothing can be fully predicted in the world. If not for today, would you ever imagine the strength of the Yu Family to be so terrifying?! Presently, the Yu Family has already revealed twelve subdivision heads with each of them no weaker than Yu ManTian. Furthermore, behind every single one of them definitely lie a secret force. While we have not seen the force with our very eyes, they should be stronger than the ordinary Yu Family experts. It would definitely not be a simple task to get rid of them, not to mention getting rid of them without suffering any losses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be a total of fourteen!\u201d Ling Jian corrected. \u201cThere are still the two experts who concealed themselves last night despite the dire circumstances. However, their aura fluctuated multiple times last night as though they wanted to take action but did not take action in the end. According to this subordinate\u2019s senses, their strength is definitely no weaker than the twelve Yu Family experts. Furthermore, there are still Yu ManTian, Yu ManLou, and Yu ManTang. This means that there are at least seventeen XianTian experts in the Yu Family currently. However, this is only what we have seen so far and we wouldn\u2019t know how many experts are still being hidden.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere should be nineteen,\u201d Ling Tian corrected. \u201cThere are still two more people, the Soul brothers of the Yu Family are still outside trying to kill me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNineteen XianTian experts?!\u201d Ling Tian and Ling Jian looked at each other with a solemn expression. In the eight Great Families, the weaker families may not even have a single XianTian expert, such as the NanGong, XiMen, and Yang Families. It can be seen just how rare a XianTian expert is. However, the Yu Family was actually able to produce nineteen XianTian experts! While it can\u2019t be said that there are as many XianTian experts as cabbages in the Yu Family, it wasn\u2019t too far off.</p><br/><p>No wonder the Yu Family had such great ambitions! Probably no family with such a powerful force would be able to remain low profile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Jian, you are the only one who truly understands the strength of both parties. Make an estimate, if the First Pavilion were to face the Yu Family now, what are the odds of victory? I want to hear the truth!\u201d After pondering for a moment, Ling Tian asked.</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian had taken action personally, he left immediately after saving Ling Jian and did not cross blows with the other Yu Family\u2019s experts. However, Ling Jian had exchanged blows with every single one of them and thus Ling Tian would say that Ling Jian was the only one who understood the strength of both parties.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the current strength of the First Pavilion, if we were to fight them face on, it would be our loss for sure!\u201d Ling Jian said without hesitation, \u201cBut\u2026 if we were to assassinate them, things wouldn\u2019t be so simple\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian considered for a long while before giving an answer, \u201cIf we were to assassinate them, the final result would probably be to\u2026 exchange a life for a life, both parties perishing together! In fact, our loss will probably be greater.\u201d After saying that, Ling Jian\u2019s forehead was filled with cold sweat! While he had never blinked an eye when killing another individual, he was currently making a prediction about the lives of his brothers!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a refined smile and Ling Jian who was used to seeing this smile could not help but shiver slightly.</p><br/><p>Every time his young noble gave such a smile, someone would be in trouble! Furthermore, he would definitely be in big, big trouble. The last time Ling Tian smiled as such, the victim was XiMen Qing\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then it is best for us to find another plan.\u201d Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cSince we know that the chances for victory are slim, why should we allow our brothers to sacrifice for nothing? I have said this before: My future is meaningless without all of you beside me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Tian\u2019s refined smile, Li Xue frowned slightly and asked doubtfully, \u201cWhat a crafty smile! You didn\u2019t seem to have this habit in the past!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? Am I very crafty?\u201d Ling Tian rubbed his nose indifferently, \u201cI am only trying to seriously discuss a plan with the both of you. In what way am I being crafty? I am obviously extremely calm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was excited to the point his face turned red and let out two coughs. However, his wounds began to open up from the coughs, and he could not help but clench his teeth in pain as he asked, \u201cDoes young noble have a plan yet? Young noble plans to\u2026\u201d As he said that, he looked at Ling Tian with a burning gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I have my plans. Could it be that I am only taking a vacation in Bright Jade City?\u201d Ling Tian stood up with his hands crossed and said with a profound tone, \u201cThe hidden strength of the Yu Family has always been my greatest concern. Apart from investigating the trump cards of the Yu Family, I was afraid that all of you will launch an operation towards the Yu Family despite not knowing their full strengths, resulting in unnecessary losses. Being able to save you back this time is already the biggest fortune out of our misfortune. However, you will probably need a good month or two before you recover fully from your injuries. After infiltrating the Yu Family alone and almost losing your life, I believe that you will know how to be obedient from now on?\u201d Ling Tian chuckled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, please don\u2019t make a joke out of me. Young noble\u2019s words seemed to be incomplete? Could there be a third reason?\u201d Ling Jian\u2019s eyes shone brightly. After following his young noble for more than ten years, Ling Jian was certain that his young noble was extremely confident. Since his young noble already had a plan, there was no need for him to worry at all. All he needed to do would be to follow the plan. Could it be that his young noble\u2019s plan would possibly go wrong? Ling Jian felt his heart ease up. While his trip to the Yu Residence seemed extremely rash, it solved the greatest worry in his young noble\u2019s heart and wasn\u2019t a wasted trip.</p><br/><p>From the way Ling Tian spoke, even if Ling Jian hadn\u2019t taken action today, he would have done something similar in the future. Only when they truly understood the Yu Family\u2019s strength could they make further plans to rule the world. Thus, the extremely dangerous move of sneaking into the Yu Residence was something that could not be avoided. While Ling Jian suffered serious injuries from his trip, he was extremely satisfied with the trip. Thankfully, he was the one to visit the Yu Residence. If his young noble was to go without a proper understanding of the Yu family\u2019s strength and end up being surrounded, while they may not necessarily be able to capture his young noble, it would be a dereliction of his duty if his young noble was to suffer any injuries!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian rubbed his chin and said with a deep gaze, \u201cSince we cannot win with strength, we must win with tactics. Since we will suffer a huge loss if we take action personally, we must bring the trouble to another party. This young noble enjoys watching a dog-eat-dog show the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be easy right?\u201d Ling Jian said with a defeated tone, \u201cWith the present strength the Shui Family has in Bright Jade City, it wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to provide any trouble for the Yu Family. If they were to break out into a fight, it would definitely be a one-sided massacre. The remaining forces of the Shui Family in the city definitely don\u2019t have the ability to fight back. While young noble\u2019s plan is brilliant, it wouldn\u2019t be of much use before the Shui Family\u2019s reinforcements arrive. If we were to delay the plan by a few days, the situation will have changed again and we would have missed our opportunity\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Shui Family?\u201d Ling Tian burst into laughter, \u201cLing Jian, do you think that only the Shui Family is capable of matching the Yu Family? Don\u2019t forget that there is the number one financial magnate in the continent concealing themselves extremely well and waiting for an opportunity! Hehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

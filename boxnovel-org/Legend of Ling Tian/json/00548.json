Why does Miss Shui ask that question?\u201d Ling Tian laughed in his heart. As a soul that came from the 21st century, how would he be concerned about such a matter? However, he was also able to guess the thoughts of Shui QianRou through this question of hers. <em>It seems like this lass has truly fallen for this young noble!</em></p><br/><p>In fact, Ling Tian was extremely clear of Shui QianRou\u2019s present thoughts and had always known about Shui QianRou\u2019s feelings towards him. But under such circumstances, he couldn\u2019t be the first to make a move or even give any hints. After all, him offering Shui QianRou advice and also all the happenings within the Shui Family in this period of time were all within his plans. For the situation of the Shui Family to deteriorate so quickly, even if a large cause of that was because of the Shui Family themselves, his Ling Family Courtyard was also a huge reason. In fact, all of the losses the Shui Family suffered in Heavenly Star were because of Ling Tian and Ling Chen. One of them slaughtered mercilessly and reaped lives like a grim reaper while the other plotted a roundabout scheme to take advantage of the situation. All the plans of the Shui Family in Heavenly Star were ruined in the hands of these two individuals.</p><br/><p>If not for Ling Tian\u2019s all-out massacre, Ling Chen\u2019s following plans would have been useless. Even if Shui QianRou was aware of this, she did not have anything to say about it. If not for the Shui Family plotting against Ling Tian\u2019s father, how would Ling Tian launch a massacre? As for all of Ling Chen\u2019s plots, Shui QianRou was completely clueless about them. In fact, she was still grateful towards Ling Chen for rescuing her from the hands of the \u2018enemy\u2019. However, she was still clueless about the fact that her father\u2019s trusted aide who was sent to protect her had perished in the hands of her sister!</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Tian changed Ling Chen\u2019s plans slightly and offered Shui QianRou a plan to resolve the Shui Family\u2019s crisis. In fact, he also had his own motives for doing that. Under the current circumstances, no matter how thick Ling Tian\u2019s skin was and regardless of whether or not he had any goodwill towards Shui QianRou, he wouldn\u2019t be able to bring himself to start a relationship with her. Besides that, Ling Tian only admired her headstrong character and acknowledged her abilities. Apart from a tinge of admiration for her beauty, Ling Tian did not have many feelings for Shui QianRou. At the very least, his feelings for her could not be compared to his feelings for the other princess of a thousand-year-old family, Yu BingYan. One was true love while the other was just some fantasies\u2026</p><br/><p>The moment Shui QianRou asked the question, she immediately realized that she shouldn\u2019t have asked such a question and could not help but flush red. But upon seeing Ling Tian\u2019s calm response, her heart turned cold. Despite her putting down her pride and throwing all of her face away, he still\u2026 In that instant, Shui QianRou had the urge to burst out crying in grief. However, she was able to suppress the grief in her heart and regained her calmness. \u201cYoung noble Ling is truly a talented individual and this is definitely a plausible plan. As compared to the destruction of my Shui Family, this can be a possible path. May I ask young noble Ling, for young noble to aid me and my Shui Family as such, what do you want in return? I don\u2019t believe that young noble does not want anything in return. I hope that young noble will not insult my intelligence and spell out your true intentions!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIntelligent, you are intelligent indeed.\u201d Ling Tian continued, \u201cWith Miss Shui\u2019s intelligence, you should know what reciprocity means. For me to pay such a huge price, it would be impossible for me to not expect anything in return. If I do not have sufficient benefits, why would I do this? However, you can definitely give me what I want.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease speak,\u201d Shui QianRou said as though she was asking Ling Tian to extort her as he wished. However, her heart was aching at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to what I know, even with the rifts in the Shui Family, your Shui Family is still the number one family in Heavenly Wind. Be it in terms of martial strength or financial capabilities, your Shui Family is definitely at the top of the food chain. In fact, if not for your Shui Family being the number one family in Heavenly Wind, the situation of the Shui Family might not have deteriorated so quickly. I want the Shui Family to support my military actions in Heavenly Wind unconditionally in the future when I invade Heavenly Wind. I want the Shui Family to aid me in controlling Heavenly Wind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnconditional support? Wouldn\u2019t my Shui Family become your subordinates? This is impossible! How can I ever accept such conditions! Even if my father was here, he would never agree to it. This is no different from you swallowing my Shui Family. Impossible, this is impossible!\u201d Shui QianRou was enraged. She thought that Ling Tian was making a fool out of her and trying to hit their Shui Family when they were down.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible? Miss Shui, don\u2019t be so certain yet.\u201d Ling Tian replied, \u201cIf any other family heard my condition, they would only be ecstatic with joy. Why does Miss Shui say that it is impossible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou raised her head stubbornly. \u201cIt is a pity that my Shui Family isn\u2019t any other family. The disciples of the Shui Family can perish but will never be a lackey for anyone else! We would rather be destroyed than submit to another power! There isn\u2019t any room for discussion!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood spirit! You are indeed the descendant of a thousand-year-old family!\u201d Ling Tian clapped his hands, \u201cHowever, when did I say that I wanted your Shui Family to submit to me? When did I say that you guys were going to be my subordinates? Shui QianRou, Miss Shui, little princess Shui, acting rashly before understanding the full picture, this isn\u2019t the Shui QianRou that I know. I don\u2019t believe that you can\u2019t understand the huge benefits of my condition. As long as the Shui Family agrees to my condition, your Shui Family will only be stronger than before! Your Shui Family would not have any signs of decline! Can\u2019t you see the benefits that your Shui Family could obtain? Miss Shui, your reaction truly surprised me. You asked me to not insult your intelligence but you are the one insulting your own intelligence at this moment! Think about it for a while. If you are unable to understand the benefits behind it then there isn\u2019t a need for us to work together. I will not work together with a fool! My plans would only be ruined as a result!\u201d</p><br/><p>After getting reprimanded by Ling Tian, Shui QianRou grew a little frustrated. But after lowering her head to think about the matter, she was immediately enlightened. Even if Ling Tian unified the continent, he would need someone to rule over it. Ling Tian\u2019s foundations and roots were in Heavenly Star and it would be impossible for him to move to Heavenly Wind. Apart from a deeply rooted family like the Shui Family, there wouldn\u2019t be a better choice! Even if Ling Tian sent over dozens of officials, their prestige would not be able to match up to the influence of the Shui Family. At the very least, for the first few decades, their Shui Family would not face any dangers.</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Tian\u2019s suggestion was extremely ideal for the Shui Family and could even be said to be an extremely good chance.</p><br/><p>The reason why Ling Tian would choose the Shui Family was also because he had no other choice. The roots of the thousand-year-old Shui Family were far too deep in Heavenly Wind. In the past few years, they were almost like the sovereigns of the continent. If Ling Tian wanted to support another power to rule over the continent, it would take far too much time and it was also difficult to pick a right party. At the same time, the Shui Family would also end up becoming unified in the face of an external threat and Ling Tian definitely did not have the time and energy to deal with all of these.</p><br/><p>Thus, his choice was naturally the Shui Family. While the Shui Family was currently filled with storms and was on the brink of destruction, even if he did not make a promise with Shui QianRou, Ling Tian would not allow the Shui Family to be destroyed. Instead, he would choose a puppet to support within the Shui Family. However, such a method was time-consuming and might not necessarily be successful.</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Tian made the effort to persuade Shui QianRou today. First, Shui QianRou was a direct descendant and second, she had feelings for him. While Ling Tian was not certain how these feelings would hold up against her loyalty to the family, it was better than nothing.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou finally came to a decision in her heart, \u201cI agree! However, you have to agree to a few of my conditions!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cMiss Shui is straightforward indeed. Please state your conditions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou paused for a moment before saying, \u201cThe first condition is that my Shui Family has to pass through our crisis first and all the degenerates of the family must be wiped out before this plan can be carried out. What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without even a thought, Ling Tian replied, \u201cNaturally. Your Shui Family filled with internal strife is like a pile of loose sand. Even if I wanted to use your Shui Family in such a state, it would be useless to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou clenched her teeth and said, \u201cThe second condition is that this plan can only be carried out after you unify Heavenly Star. If you are able to unify Heavenly Star, this plan will be carried out. But what if you lose in the battle of hegemony in Heavenly Star? Our Shui Family would never send troops over to aid you. You have to understand this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian burst out laughing. \u201cOf course. If I end up losing the war, you can forget about this agreement with me. At that time, I would definitely be dead. How would I be able to invade Heavenly Wind? Your Shui Family can naturally continue to be the hegemon of Heavenly Wind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou felt her heart shake. Upon hearing Ling Tian mention his death, Shui QianRou felt a piercing pain in her heart and her face turned pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the third condition,\u2026\u201d Shui QianRou paused for a moment and suddenly said, \u201ccan I hold on to this third condition?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on to a condition?\u201d Ling Tian said with depression. He had already predicted that Shui QianRou would have her conditions and the first two conditions that she made were within his expectations. However, he never expected her to say that she wanted to hold on to a condition. On top of that, the two conditions that Ling Tian felt had the largest room for negotiation had not appeared!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, I can\u2019t think of it right now.\u201d Shui QianRou looked at Ling Tian. \u201cI will let you know when I think of it. I hope that you will not reject me at that time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian took two steps out of the door and turned around, \u201cAlright. However, I hope that you do not come up with unrealistic or unreasonable conditions,\u201d Ling Tian smiled brightly, \u201cbecause I will not accept them even if you mention them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou rolled her eyes at Ling Tian\u2019s shameless words. Even if she kept some room for future negotiation, Ling Tian also had the right to reject her. On this point, they had tied in this round of negotiations. However, Ling Tian\u2019s plan already had some initial success.</p></div>\n</div>"}

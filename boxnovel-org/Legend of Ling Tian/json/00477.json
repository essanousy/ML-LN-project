In just a blink of an eye, he had already traversed hundreds of feet and as he sprinted wildly, Ling Tian could even hear the sound of his body slicing across the air. The morning breeze which should have blown onto his face gently had actually turned into sharp blades pressing onto his face as he sprinted wildly!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian did not turn back! He did not dare to turn back!</p><br/><p>The instant he charged out of the mist, Ling Tian could feel a figure giving chase to him. This person was undoubtedly Yu ManLou! Apart from Yu ManLou, not a single person in the Yu Family would possess such mysterious cultivation! Not to mention the Yu Family, apart from Justice, Ling Tian had never met such a powerful opponent. Even Ye QingChen who he had met back then did not have such strength!</p><br/><p>The single palm strike he exchanged with Yu ManLou already allowed Ling Tian to fully understand Yu ManLou\u2019s strength! The inner qi of that palm strike was potent and unblockable! At the same time, it was like the waves of an ocean, forever crashing onto the shore!</p><br/><p>The instant darkness covered the earth, the Family Head of the thousand-year-old family, Yu ManLou, revealed his true strength that he had always concealed! He faced Ling Tian\u2019s confident palm strike and dispersed the force of Ling Tian\u2019s palm strike before infiltrating Ling Tian\u2019s meridians with his remaining inner qi causing Ling Tian\u2019s blood to boil! Ling Tian then could not help but feel a stuffy feeling in his chest and almost spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately understood that his previous estimation of Yu ManLou\u2019s strength based on Yu ManTian\u2019s strength was a huge underestimation of Yu ManLou\u2019s true strength. Even if he had started training from his mother\u2019s womb and trained the mystical Divine Shocking Dragon Formula, his less than twenty years of cultivation could not be compared to the decades\u2019 worth of Yu ManLou\u2019s cultivation. He did indeed live up to the name of being the Family Head of the number one martial family in the continent!</p><br/><p>The strength that he displayed was only slightly weaker than Justice\u2019s! How did a Family Head like him, who enjoyed riches all of his life, cultivate to such a level? Furthermore, a chilly and evil qi was hidden within Yu ManLou\u2019s pure inner qi and also caused Ling Tian huge trouble! Without this chilly and evil qi, Ling Tian would take a step back at the very most but with it, everything was completely different!</p><br/><p>It was because Ling Tian was unable to instantly get rid of this chilly inner qi with his own Divine Shocking Dragon Formula! Ever since he arrived in this world, this was a first for Ling Tian! Even when facing Justice\u2019s tyrannical and pure inner qi, his Divine Shocking Dragon Formula would be able to instantly rid his body of Justice\u2019s inner qi. While he would still be injured, it wouldn\u2019t cause him a great deal of harm.</p><br/><p>However, this wave of inner qi had stayed in Ling Tian\u2019s body for a long while and had even roamed around his meridians! This made Ling Tian extremely depressed in his heart. He had seen the inner qi of many Yu Family experts before; from Yu BingYan, from Yu ManTian and even from both Xue Leng and Xue Fei. The Divine Bright Jade Formula of the Yu Family should have been righteous and gentle, but definitely not chilly and evil as what he had experienced from Yu ManLou. As the Family Head of the Yu Family, why would Yu ManLou possess such an evil and sinister inner qi?</p><br/><p>Not only was Yu ManLou\u2019s inner qi extremely odd and vicious, it wasn\u2019t an upright and frank method. If Yu ManLou was to use it when engaging in a frontal confrontation with an opponent, he would be able to catch his enemy off guard for sure. However, if it was used in a war, there wouldn\u2019t be much of a use. This was something that Ling Tian knew in his heart. If given enough time, Ling Tian was also confident that he would be able to neutralize it.</p><br/><p>However, it was a pity that time was what Ling Tian lacked the most!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yu ManLou had already chased over like a shadow and was so close behind Ling Tian that Ling Tian did not even have the chance to unleash his hidden weapons! While it was because of Yu ManLou\u2019s sinister inner qi that caused Ling Tian\u2019s inner qi to be unable to flow smoothly and slowed Ling Tian down, it was also sufficient to show that Yu ManLou\u2019s movement technique was extremely close to Justice\u2019s!</p><br/><p>Both of them sprinted through the morning breeze like a shooting star and regardless of how Ling Tian circulated his inner qi, he wasn\u2019t able to open up the gap between them. Ling Tian\u2019s Divine Shocking Dragon Formula circulated quickly and Ling Tian resolutely fought the sinister inner qi in his body, slowly getting rid of it. As long as this sinister inner qi remained in his body, Ling Tian would never dare to fully unleash his movement techniques.</p><br/><p>If that was the case, this sinister qi might enter his meridians and that would spell trouble for him. At that time, it would take him more than ten times the effort to expel it from his body!</p><br/><p>Thus, the distance between them remained unchanged!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was also filled with doubt in his heart. He was extremely clear about the destructive force of that chilly inner qi. All of these years, there were many experts of the pugilistic world who had perished under his hands because of this infallible inner qi of his. He was certain that even Justice wouldn\u2019t be able to escape from this inner qi of his. Thus, this had always been Yu ManLou\u2019s proudest trump card! However, he could not help but be doubtful at this moment. His inner qi had obviously entered Ling Tian\u2019s body, but Ling Tian was still able to jump around so actively and run around so quickly. Could it be that Ling Tian wasn\u2019t afraid of losing his mobility the moment his internal injuries act up? To Yu ManLou, this was something that he could not understand!</p><br/><p>He had already unleashed his movement techniques completely but regardless of how he sped up, Ling Tian was able to keep seventy feet away from him. Even after sprinting for over ten miles, the distance between the both of them had not widened for the slightest bit! This was truly bizarre! If Ling Tian wasn\u2019t injured, wouldn\u2019t that mean that Ling Tian would be able to throw him off easily?!</p><br/><p>The thick city walls were already close, and a thick forest was in sight. This was also the reason why Ling Tian dashed forward at full speed without turning. As the guards on the city walls witnessed the two speeding figures, they could not help but flustered and a guard shouted out, \u201cWho goes there? Stop there!\u201d</p><br/><p>Carrying with him a powerful gust of wind, Ling Tian darted up the city walls and without a single trace of hesitation he sent the city guard flying with a kick. Following that, he flew down from the seventy feet high city walls and shot out fifty feet away, arrived beside the soldier who he sent flying. He then tapped on the body of the soldier and further propelled himself.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou, who was behind him, also did a set of similar actions. He shot up the city walls shortly after Ling Tian and with two kicks, two spears on the city wall went sent propelling towards Ling Tian\u2019s back. With another kick, he then sent a city guard flying and with a wave of his sleeves, his body shot out like a cannon and followed after Ling Tian with the exact same technique!</p><br/><p>With a single leap, Ling Tian had already traversed almost 200 feet from the city walls, and the force from his jump was exhausted. Right when he was about to land, a sharp shrill could be heard from behind him and the two spears which Yu ManLou had sent flying were right on his tail! What an accurate strike! What fabulous eyesight! If Ling Tian wasn\u2019t the person on the receiving end of these two spears, any others would have definitely perished!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian took in a deep breath and descended at full force. At the same time, his body straightened out horizontally in midair as though he was lying down on an invisible bed.</p><br/><p>With swooshing sounds, the two spears shot past his back. Ling Tian continued his descent and was a mere thirty feet away from the ground. He then grabbed onto one of the spears and stabbed in towards the ground, borrowing the force of his descent to speed up the spear like a landing meteorite. With a loud bang, the spear penetrated into the ground with more than half of the spear body being embedded within the earth!</p><br/><p>However, the force from Ling Tian\u2019s descent had not been completely nullified! Ling Tian took in a deep breath and made a split second decision. He imbued his inner qi into the spear and propelled his body forward while holding onto the spear firmly. The flexible body of the spear than curved into a beautiful arc and Ling Tian unleashed the inner qi which he had imbued into the spear. Through his powerful inner qi, a loud bang sounded and a large amount of soil was forcefully dislodged and sent flying towards the incoming Yu ManLou!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian finally nullified the force of his descent, and he rolled a few times on the ground before bursting forward at full speed again! From the start of being pursued by Yu ManLou until now, Ling Tian had yet to even take a glance back!</p><br/><p>Right when Yu ManLou was about the land on the ground, he saw a thick layer of soil flying towards him. His calm face revealed a trace of anger and with a fierce palm strike, his figure sliced through the soil wall like a hot knife cutting through butter. However, he never expected to be greeted by the spear that he had just sent towards Ling Tian! The spear was imbued with Ling Tian\u2019s powerful inner qi and was definitely not to be underestimated!</p><br/><p>However, this was definitely not an intentional move by Ling Tian but was completely because of Yu ManLou\u2019s \u2018good\u2019 luck. As long as Yu ManLou was a slight bit later, the force of the spear would be spent and it wouldn\u2019t be a threat. However, Yu ManLou was far too anxious and had met face to face with the spear.</p><br/><p>However, if Yu ManLou didn\u2019t give chase at full speed, Ling Tian would be able to shake him off with just a small delay!</p><br/><p>A loud bang sounded! Yu ManLou\u2019s palm smashed onto the spear\u2019s body and with a \u2018kacha\u2019 sound, the body of the spear was destroyed. However, Yu ManLou\u2019s figure was also slowed down by this powerful clash.</p><br/><p>A tinge of red could be seen in Yu ManLoud\u2019s eyes as he witnessed Ling Tian enter the forest! The killing intent in his eyes grew stronger and stronger!</p><br/><p>I have to kill Ling Tian today!</p><br/><p>Despite his young age, he has such achievements in his martial arts! He would definitely be a future calamity, and I must get rid of him!</p><br/><p>If I miss this opportunity today, I will probably not have a chance to get rid of him again!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou then barged into the forest, smashing away all the branches and leaves that got in his way like a giant crashing through a dense forest! The moment he entered the forest, Yu ManLou immediately fell into a daze.</p><br/><p>The situation before his very eyes was completely out of his expectations!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

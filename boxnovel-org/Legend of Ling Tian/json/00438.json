Since you have already consumed a spiritual herb and had a large improvement in your cultivation, this Great Cyclic Pellet is a useless item to you and there isn\u2019t a need for you to think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue responded with an \u2018Mmm\u2019 as she tied a final knot on Ling Tian\u2019s bandages, \u201cAll done!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at his own body and almost burst out laughing. With his attention being distracted by his conversation with Li Xue, he never noticed that his wounds were fully bandaged already. However, the way it was bandaged was just too\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a bitter laughter as he looked at Li Xue, \u201cLi Xue, the Dragon Boat Festival is over already and you haven\u2019t had enough dumplings?\u201d</p><br/><p>As Li Xue scanned Ling Tian\u2019s current appearance, she couldn\u2019t help but burst out into laughter at the uncanny resemblance Ling Tian had to a dumpling!</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Tian\u2019s depressed look, Li Xue chuckled and kissed Ling Tian on the cheek as she consoled, \u201cAlright, alright, even if I haven\u2019t had enough dumplings, I wouldn\u2019t swallow young noble Ling. Be good, don\u2019t be angry. Hehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bright Jade City.</p><br/><p>After Yu ManTang and Yu ManTian had bid farewell to their brother, they took a hundred-plus followers out from the western gate!</p><br/><p>Along the way, Yu ManTang was obviously extremely troubled and even the usually boorish and optimistic Yu ManTian was silent and depressed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother has really changed a lot recently.\u201d Yu ManTang looked at the red clouds on the horizon and let out a sigh, \u201cHe has changed to the point I can no longer recognize him. Is he still our big brother, Yu ManLou?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Yu ManTian asked in confusion, \u201cSecond brother, what nonsense are you spouting? Do you think that big brother is actually someone else in disguise? How can that be possible? How can there be such an amazing face changing technique in the world? While big brother has made many vexing decisions recently, he is still big brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou! You are truly clueless about everything! I am obviously not talking about someone disguising himself as big brother but how he has become overly ambitious and impatient recently. If it was in the past, it wouldn\u2019t be of any concern to me. But now, this may not be a good thing for our Yu Family.\u201d Yu ManTang glared at Yu ManTian as he thought to himself, Talking to this fellow is no different from a chicken talking to a duck. I wonder if I will go crazy from anger in this trip!</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t really think so. As that fellow grows older, his temper has become much better. He is much better towards you because you both like to scheme against others. In the past, it has always been both of you scheming against others together. If not for BingYan being involved this round, you would probably be on his side also!\u201d Yu ManTian pursed his lips in dissatisfaction, \u201cTowards me, I think he only knows how to beat me up! However, this daddy here can\u2019t fight back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you calling this daddy? You dare to call yourself daddy when talking to your second brother?!\u201d Yu ManTang flew into a rage. However, because he understood his third brother\u2019s character and didn\u2019t know how to reprimand Yu ManTian, he could only let things slide, \u201cThird brother, when are you going to change the way you speak? Big brother has scolded you about it countless of times already and you now dare to call yourself daddy in front of me? Do you believe that I will send you back right now? Isn\u2019t your daddy the same as my daddy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian chuckled with a \u2018what can you do to me\u2019 expression. But the next moment, he also let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>This fellow also knows how to sigh? Yu ManTang looked at his third brother curiously. Ever since his third brother was born, Yu ManTang had almost never seen him sighing before. Just what had happened to his third brother today? Even this boorish fellow knows how to feel depressed?</p><br/><p>Seeing his second brother\u2019s doubtful gaze, Yu ManTian urged his horse to move up faster but didn\u2019t say another word. In the past few days, he had been thinking of the six little brothers of his in Sky Bearing. Those days were truly wonderful\u2026 However, could they be the assassins of the First Pavilion? Their swordplay was truly made for killing. Especially that Ling Jian, capable of killing an individual without blinking his eyes!</p><br/><p>If those few brats are the assassins of the First Pavilion, just what should I do? Should I tell big brother about it? If I tell him, big brother will definitely kill them without a second word. He would rather kill the wrong person than risk letting the culprit go! However, what if they weren\u2019t from the First Pavilion? Wouldn\u2019t I be harming them? What good seedlings\u2026 Without them around, who would spar with me in future?</p><br/><p>Thus, Third Master Yu had been feeling extremely troubled for the past few days. While one of the reasons for him to volunteer to go to the Lei Family was to protect his second brother, it was also a way for him to escape from his frustrations. At the very least, it was better than him acting like a thief with a guilty conscience.</p><br/><p>With regards to the matter between the Ling and Yu Family, Third Master Yu felt that whether from the perspective of morals or reason, his family was the one in the wrong. However, he was trapped in the middle and felt extremely miserable about it. He definitely couldn\u2019t face his conscience if he were to help his own family and it would be impossible for him to help the Ling Family. If he chose not to help either party, he also felt extremely horrible. Thus, he decided to escape from everything for a period of time!</p><br/><p>With big brother\u2019s martial arts, as long as he doesn\u2019t meet that Martial Order Medallion owner, he will definitely be fine. With Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts, he would definitely be able to make it out alive. Just let them do whatever they want! Third Master Yu thought to himself.</p><br/><p>If Yu ManLou knew of his third brother\u2019s thoughts, he would definitely regret sending Yu ManTian away at such a critical moment. If there was someone in the world who would be able to make a full retreat from the elites of the First Pavilion, it would definitely be Third Master Yu! Furthermore, Third Master Yu was also the only person who could expose the relationship Ling Tian had with the First Pavilion!</p><br/><p>Was this the so-called, \u2018a thousand considerations by a foolish individual would definitely hit the spot somewhere\u2019?!</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 when the Lei Family wanted to enter Heavenly Star back then, they were stopped by our Yu Family. The Lei Family Head, Lei ZhenTian personally came to negotiate the matter with big brother but both you and I were not present. After that, the Lei Family retreated for some reason and never mentioned the matter of entering Heavenly Star again. However, the strength of the Lei Family was already not to be underestimated back then and after developing over the past few years, who knows how well developed they are now. Furthermore, they have close ties with the Moon Deity Empire and can be said to be a single entity. For us to invite their entry this time and being on the passive side, I really don\u2019t know if this is a blessing or misfortune\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares about that?\u201d With his attention being shifted, Yu ManTian returned to his usual boorish self, \u201cIf they dare to act unbridled, we just have to beat them back again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIdiot! Our Yu Family blocked them from entering back then and has already lost a great deal of face by inviting them in now! At that time, do you expect us to chase them out again?\u201d Yu ManTang felt his blood boiling. \u201cFurthermore, the present situation is extremely odd. With so many things happening in our family currently, why would big brother want to send the both of us out? If it was only for this matter, I wouldn\u2019t believe it for sure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian held onto the reins with a single hand as his head drooped down sleepily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think big brother\u2019s arrangement is to avoid us, so he can deal with Ling Tian without any obstructions.\u201d Yu ManTang let out a long sigh with his brows furrowed, \u201cWe can only hope for that child to have good fortune and deal with the matter himself. Even if we stay behind, we wouldn\u2019t be able to change anything and would be stuck in a dilemma. Big brother\u2019s actions can also be considered kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>After letting out a self-depreciating chuckle, he looked towards Yu ManTian.</p><br/><p>A loud roar sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu ManTian! You b*st*rd! This daddy is talking to you, and you dare to doze off!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 who hit this daddy? Ah\u2026\u201d Amid Yu ManTian\u2019s goans, two horses sped up suddenly and a loud roar could be heard, \u201cYou little brat had better not run away! When I catch up to you, I will beat you to death! You darn b*st*rd!\u201d</p><br/><p>At a position not too far away, a male and female were hidden in the bushes, witnessing the troops gradually leaving their sights. The white-dressed male then muttered, \u201cStrange, with the storms stirring in the Yu Family, why would Yu ManLou send both of his brothers out? If he was afraid that Yu ManTian would ruin his affairs, that would still be an acceptable explanation. However, that Yu ManTang is a wise individual and can be considered as one of the few strategists in the continent currently. Why would Yu ManLou send him out at such a time and further thin out the strength of his Yu Family? Could it be that Yu ManLou has something else to rely on? Could it be that he has other trump cards?\u201d</p><br/><p>By his side, the blue-dressed lady twitched her lips, \u201cWhy bother thinking so much about it? You just need to go in and ask. Furthermore, this can be considered something good for you, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The white-dressed man nodded and a smile surfaced on his lips, \u201cLi Xue, we are about to enter Bright Jade City and we definitely can\u2019t enter with our original appearance. What should we do? Do you want to dress up as my maid or study attendant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are both of my character choices your servant?\u201d Li Xue snorted, \u201cAren\u2019t you a little too good at taking advantage of me? I won\u2019t choose either one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how do you want to go in?\u201d the white-dressed man was naturally Ling Tian. With their speed, they had arrived at Bright Jade City in a short half a day. After a night of rest, they were brimming with energy, and Ling Tian had finally tidied up his meridians up to the ninth stage with the correct Divine Shocking Dragon Formula.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do I want to go in?\u201d Li Xue thought for a moment before giggling, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you dress up as my maid?! With your elegant appearance and fair skin, I would definitely take pity on you! If not we can dress up as a husband and wife pair and sneak into the city. Wouldn\u2019t our disguise be even more perfect? There definitely isn\u2019t a better idea than these two! You can choose one of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough cough\u2026\u201d Ling Tian began coughing incessantly\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

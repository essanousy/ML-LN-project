Right now, Xiao YanXue was in an emotional state of mind, and she couldn\u2019t be provoked any further. \u201cThe reason why I can\u2019t decide right now is because of three things. First, your emotions are not stable yet, and I\u2019m afraid that you will regret this decision in the future. Second, you should also be aware that your identity is too sensitive. The moment it gets leaked, then you will receive the condescending stares from the rest of the world. Can you bear with that? Would you be willing to? As for the last point\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian took a deep breath, as though finding a way to phrase it. After frowning for quite a while, he finally spoke with difficulty, \u201cThe last point, regarding this matter, while the Xiao Family did sacrifice your happiness, I\u2019m also the same by throwing stones at you while you\u2019re down, attempting to create a rift between you and your family. While my words might have been real, but my motive is indeed to destroy your relationship between you and your family. That much I will not lie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue opened her eyes wide, staring at Ling Tian. Upon hearing his last sentence, her eyes started to gleam.</p><br/><p>After speaking, Ling Tian felt as though his heart was opened up. \u201cAs such, I really don\u2019t dare to use you! I\u2019ll give you some time, think over it carefully before making a decision. I will never force you. If after considering it thoroughly you still have the same choice, then I\u2019ll be very happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Stroking her silky hair, Ling Tian smiled tenderly at her. \u201cLittle lass, there are some things that can\u2019t be put down so easily. You might not have considered it clearly, but while your family looks as though they have abandoned you, harming you, they are in the end your blood relatives. You helping me is akin to pitting yourself against your own family. This sort of torture, if you\u2019re not prepared for it, will drive you crazy. I indeed hope that you will be able to help me, but I\u2019m not prepared to make you suffer a lifetime as a consequence!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tears dripped down from Xiao YanXue\u2019s face, but the look in her eyes had already calmed down a lot as compared to before. Looking at Ling Tian with gratitude, she hoarsely enunciated word after word, \u201cThank you for your candidness, Ling Tian!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian warmly smiled, stretching out a finger and dabbing on her nose as he replied, \u201cOnce all is clear, you will feel comfortable and I will also feel happy. Days that are spent scheming and plotting against one another are the worst to go through. I understand that, and I\u2019m sure you do too, right?\u201d He then sighed, posing exaggeratedly as he continued, \u201cSeems like being a nice person is better, at least you feel so much more comfortable in your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue only let out a small smile, as she held on to one of Ling Tian\u2019s finger. She whispered, \u201cAfter we bade farewell that day at Sky Bearing, I never thought of scheming or plotting against you anymore. To hear you say that actually fills me with happiness.\u201d Pausing for a moment, she broke into a cheeky smile as she continued, \u201cSeeing you speak so frankly, aren\u2019t you actually scheming something? It\u2019s just that your scheme this time is a flawless one if you\u2019re able to perform as such.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed out. Thinking about it, YanXue\u2019s words really made sense. Right now, given that her mood was at rock bottom, his explanations would give her a sort of reassurance in her heart.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a self-mocking laugh, \u201cIt seems like I have been scheming too much. Any casual statement of mine has such a deep scheme hiding behind it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue pursed her lips and grunted, \u201cYou are not a good person at all; a big baddie from head to toe.\u201d She then let out a bright smile, \u201cActually, ladies need to be coaxed. As for coaxing them, it is actually no different from lying to them. However, if you can lie to a lady to bring her joy for a lifetime, even if she knows that you are a liar, she would still be willingly lied to. If you are able to achieve that, you would undoubtedly be an accomplished liar.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she wiped away her tears, Xiao YanXue was suddenly in a great mood and she pecked Ling Tian on the cheek before saying shyly, \u201cLing Tian, I am truly happy. Even if you want to lie to me, lie to me for a lifetime.\u201d She then let go of Ling Tian and lowered her flushed head.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was filled with warmth in his heart. Xiao YanXue was probably glad about him not scheming against her right? After patting her head lightly, he walked out without saying a thing.</p><br/><p>Closing the door, he could hear Xiao YanXue\u2019s lovable whining, \u201cPig head! A pig head who doesn\u2019t know how to read the atmosphere!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but stumble as he grumbled in his heart, I have already been holding it in for a few months and you still dared to entice me as such. It is not that I don\u2019t know how to read the mood but the moment I start, the heavenly lightning would definitely descend and the earthly flames will burn. At that time, your chastity would definitely not be kept. Do you think the matters between a man and a woman are just kissing each other on the cheeks?</p><br/><p>After Ling Jian and Li Xue left, Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of loneliness. However, he also had fewer burdens to be concerned about. As such, he immediately began his operation.</p><br/><p>Everything had to be completed before that third young noble Yu steals the Snow Jade Sky Reversal Pellet if he wanted to watch a good show. If their deal is completed, the people from Above Heavens would definitely escape and he would lose his protagonist for the show!</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Second young noble Yu walked out of the room comfortably as he stood in the courtyard with a set of pristine white robes. Thinking about the wild night he had last night, the soft body in his arms, the fragrant aroma\u2026 that pleading sound filled with ecstasy\u2026 Yu LiuFeng couldn\u2019t help but replay the many scenes in his head and he suddenly felt a wave of heat in his abdomen. He couldn\u2019t help but have the urge to charge back into the room and go for a second round.</p><br/><p>A black-robed figure walked over and stood behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Yu LiuFeng didn\u2019t turn back and plucked off a wooden hibiscus from the tree in front of him as he thought, If I placed this beautiful flower in front of Chun Xiang, would the flower or human be more attractive?</p><br/><p>\u201cThird young noble Yu returned extremely late last night and actually beat Old Seven Lu up. Not only was his arm broken, his nose was also fractured.\u201d The black-robed man hesitated for a moment before replying.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was the reason behind beating up Old Seven Lu?\u201d Yu LiuFeng\u2019s eyes gleamed, and he unknowingly crushed the flower in his hand. \u201cWhere did third brother go? Why was he back so late?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird young noble probably went to his Jasper Flower Courtyard. On the way back to the Yu Residence, Old Seven Lu wanted his signature and he\u2026 However, in the past few days, third young noble didn\u2019t stay the night in the courtyard.\u201d the black-robed man said respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t stay the night?\u201d Yu LiuFeng raised his eyebrows and said doubtfully, \u201cHe is like a hungry ghost among lechers and he can actually hold himself back?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-robed man couldn\u2019t help but be filled with awkwardness. He looked at his young noble who had obviously just come out from his beauty\u2019s embrace with a trace of lasciviousness still lingering in his aura, yet had the cheek to say that his brother was like a hungry ghost among lechers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese two days, there have been many people coming in and out from second young master\u2019s residence. Third young noble had requested to search them but was rejected by the Head Deacon.\u201d The black-robed man lowered his head and said, \u201cThus, third young noble has been extremely displeased with the black-robed disciples of the Deacons Hall and thus found an excuse to vent his anger\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu LiuFeng sighed and the look of viciousness between his brows grew. \u201cWhat did Head Deacon say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHead Deacon didn\u2019t say a thing and there isn\u2019t anything to say in the first place.\u201d The black-robed man raised his head, and a tinge of dissatisfaction could be seen in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course I know.\u201d Yu LiuFeng waved his hands, \u201cLittle Madam\u2019s relatives from the countryside are here to find a job. They are only ordinary folks, and third brother will never be able to topple me with this small reason. What an idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-robed man didn\u2019t leave and after hesitating for a long while, he finally said, \u201cThere seem to be unknown characters entering and leaving the Jasper Flower Courtyard\u2026 however, we aren\u2019t very certain. Perhaps we made a mistake or perhaps the martial arts of the unknown individual is too high.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Yu LiuFeng\u2019s lit up for a moment before pacing around in thought, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-robed man then bowed respectfully and took his leave. As Yu LiuFeng looked at the black-robed man\u2019s departing figure, a strange glow shone in his eyes as he clenched his fists as though he made a resolute decision.</p><br/><p>Yu LiuFeng then waved his sleeves and left hastily.</p><br/><p>A long while later, a figure shook in the shadow of the bushes and Ling Tian\u2019s smiling face gradually appeared. A petite figure then walked out of the room and after the both of them looked at each other and gave each other a nod, Ling Tian broke out into a bright smile and disappeared again.</p><br/><p>The sun was setting and another day went by. Darkness then gradually ate away the sunlight.</p><br/><p>In the room, Ling Tian held onto a strange item and his right hand was holding onto some flour-like substance, both soft and sticky. It was as though he was sticking something onto Xiao YanXue\u2019s face before carefully sanding it smooth. A short while later, Xiao YanXue\u2019s face became puffy and chubby. Her originally slim and narrow jawline turned into a watermelon. Her lipid eyes were also turned into vicious looking triangular eyes under Ling Tian\u2019s makeup.</p><br/><p>Finally, Ling Tian took out a small jade bottle from his bosom and poured out a bit of powder from it before keeping it away in a treasured manner. He then added some water to the powder before applying it to Xiao YanXue\u2019s face, arms, neck and any place where her skin would show.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue sat there with shyness as she felt Ling Tian\u2019s gentle movements and his warmth on her face. The warmth of his arms seemed to have permeated through her skin and warmed her soul\u2026 She couldn\u2019t help but shut her eyes and let out soft moaning sounds as though she was muttering something.</p><br/><p>However, Xiao YanXue never noticed that wherever Ling Tian\u2019s palm rubbed across, her skin would turn dark and crude. A beautiful lady had turned into a completely ugly lady who a beggar wouldn\u2019t even take a second glance\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then stood up and took two steps back to admire his own piece of work with satisfaction in his eyes. This made Xiao YanXue feel even more embarrassed as she thought to herself, Looking at the admiration in his eyes, I should probably be extremely beautiful at this moment\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

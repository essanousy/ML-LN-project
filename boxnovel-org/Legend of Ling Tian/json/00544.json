There isn\u2019t a need for you to find it strange. The moment both his brothers sent him flying with their swords, I could tell where the problem was.\u201d Ling Tian replied, \u201cThe three of them should be cultivating the Joint Attack Formula. Only when the three of them are as one will they be able to unleash their strongest attacks. However, you only faced a single person and thus naturally found that his moves were incomplete. However, if you ever meet the three of them together, you must not underestimate them! You should avoid them if you can! With the three of them working together, even Li Xue wouldn\u2019t be able to easily win against them!\u201d As he said those last words, Ling Tian\u2019s tone became heavy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey will never get the chance to join hands again.\u201d Ling Chen smiled and a tinge of depression could be seen in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Ling Tian was a little surprised, \u201cWhy so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause I killed him already.\u201d Ling Chen said with her body trembling slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYOU KILLED HIM?!\u201d Ling Tian stood up abruptly and startled all the rest present in the meeting. They then saw Ling Tian stretching his head out and looking at Ling Chen closely, \u201cMy goodness, you actually killed him? This\u2026 how is this possible?!\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s words were filled with incredulity as though he saw a female cat being picked up by a male mouse\u2026</p><br/><p>It was also no wonder that Ling Tian was so surprised. When he left, while Ling Chen\u2019s martial arts were extremely high, she did not even dare to kill a mouse. Who would have thought that after being away for a few months, it was as though Bodhisattva turned into the devil? Regardless of how flexible Ling Tian could be in his thinking, he just wasn\u2019t able to wrap his head around the matter.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing the delighted expression on Li Xue\u2019s face beside him, how could Ling Tian not understand what was going on? He could not help but take in a breath of cold air. To train Ling Chen to such an extent, she must have suffered from quite a bit of shock right? If he was still around, he definitely wouldn\u2019t bear forcing her as such.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s face flushed red as she leaned back slightly. Currently, the two of them were not alone in this room and Miss Li Xue was crossing her arms and watching happily by the side. On top of that, Ling Jian and the rest were also watching them like a show. After all, Ling Tian had always remained calm and steady in all situations and would never react in such an exaggerated manner\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble\u2026 what are you doing? Everyone is watching us\u2026\u201d Ling Chen tried to lean back as far as she could and her back formed a beautiful crescent shape with her face bright red. Ling Tian\u2019s body was hovering over her body and was a few short feet away from her. Ling Chen could only try her best to lean back as much as she can\u2026 While she had the urge to push Ling Tian\u2019s head aside, she could not bear to do so in her heart. Feeling Ling Tian\u2019s warm breath on her face, she became all the more distressed and embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian finally settled the shock in his heart and at the moment, Ling Chen was almost forced to the ground. Looking at Ling Chen\u2019s adorable appearance of being reluctant to push him aside, he felt a heat in his abdomen and could not help but give her a smooch.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen immediately let out a shriek. She never imagined at her young noble\u2019s skin would be thick to the point that he would kiss her in front of everyone else. Her embarrassment reached its peak and the breath that she was holding was finally released as she collapsed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Everyone burst out laughing in unison. Even the usually zombified Ling Jian was also all smiles at this moment.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen quickly got up with a shriek and flew out of the room as though she was escaping. However, everyone could clearly see that her usually fair ears were bright red in color\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stood up without a change of expression and said with an innocent tone, \u201cI can\u2019t be blamed, right? Who would have thought that a martial arts expert like her would fall down so easily?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe let out a few dry coughs, \u201cCough cough\u2026 of course\u2026 young noble can\u2019t be blamed\u2026 cough cough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue walked over to Ling Tian\u2019s side and snorted, \u201cBingYan is already extremely familiar with melding martial arts into her paintings. She has also achieved elementary accomplishment in melding her paintings into martial arts and you should go and visit her when you have the time. Right, your Divine Shocking Dragon Formula should be at the tenth level already, right? Me, you, and little sister Ling Chen should find a time to take care of her Heavenly Negative Locked Meridians. It is a hidden disaster waiting to happen, and with the three of us joining hands, we should have a 90% chance of getting rid of it. It wouldn\u2019t be good to rely on the Great Cyclic Pellet to suppress it all the time. If the Great Cyclic Pellet is consumed in excess, BingYan\u2019s meridians wouldn\u2019t be able to endure the potent medicinal effects of the Great Cyclic Pellet after her Heavenly Negative Locked Meridians are removed. It is best for us to take care of it as soon as possible,\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian nodded his head in agreement and he had also thought about this matter before his return. He originally intended to join hands with Ling Chen to help remove the Heavenly Negative Locked Meridians for Yu BingYan. Now that he had another Li Xue and the fact that Li Xue\u2019s attainment of the Divine Ice Formula was no weaker than Ling Chen, the risks of removing the Heavenly Negative Locked Meridians would naturally be much less. On top of that, his own cultivation had also improved greatly and the success rate should be more than 90%.</p><br/><p>Li Xue then glared at Ling Tian and said, \u201cJust wait for younger sister Ling Chen to settle the score with you tonight.\u201d She then walked away proudly, not forgetting to look at Ling Jian with disdain as though she was looking at someone who wasn\u2019t her match.</p><br/><p>This gaze of hers was akin to adding fuel to the fire and a fierce glare shot out from Ling Jian\u2019s eyes. His battle intent soared to the heavens and almost wanted to challenge Li Xue on the spot!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian rubbed his chin and grinned, \u201cI would love for her to do that.\u201d However, no one replied to him and he could not help but be puzzled.</p><br/><p>Looking around, Ling Tian realized that the only person left was the fuming Ling Jian. Meng LiGe and Feng Mo had already escaped from the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2019Jian, after a life and death encounter, your swordplay seems to have improved greatly.\u201d Looking at Ling Jian standing by his side solemnly as though he wanted to say something, how could Ling Tian not know what he was thinking about? However, Ling Tian could not bear to let Ling Jian get abused by Li Xue and thus changed the topic by praising Ling Jian while preparing to make his escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, please allow me to fight her!\u201d Ling Jian\u2019s voice was resolute with his battle intent roaring.</p><br/><p>One of Ling Tian\u2019s foot was already halfway out the door as he replied, not knowing whether to laugh or cry, \u201cAh\u2019Jian, we are all on the same side. Why not forget about it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face turned cold as he said with a grievance, \u201cYoung noble may not know. When I was injured, this demoness placed goldthread into my medicine and if I didn\u2019t drink it, she would add earthworms into the medicine\u2026 along the way back, I drank a full nineteen bowls of medicine filled with goldthread! I\u2026 I\u2026 I must definitely give her a good beating! I seek young noble\u2019s understanding!\u201d When talking about his nightmarish experience, Ling Jian\u2019s teeth was grit and his veins began to bulge. He had an extremely fierce expression on his face and no longer looked like the cold assassin he usually was.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was stunned for a moment and could not help but laugh bitterly. He never imagined that Li Xue would prank Ling Jian in such a manner. No wonder Ling Jian would act as though he had a life and death enmity with her. He then let out a sigh and said helplessly, \u201cAh\u2019Jian, it seems that you drank these nineteen bowls for nothing. Why is your martial arts the only thing that is improving and not your brains\u2026 she is a lady after all and a loss would be extremely embarrassing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe will not be embarrassed and I will not go overboard. She is a lady after all. I only need young noble to approve this battle of ours!\u201d Ling Jian was filled with confidence and a smirk could be seen on his face. At this moment, he had completely forgotten about the painful experience of losing under Ling Chen\u2019s hands. He then added on with delight, \u201cThe person who loses must drink nineteen bowls of goldthread water. Regardless of victory or defeat, this matter will be resolved after the battle!\u201d Ling Jian took a step forward anxiously and said, \u201cYoung noble, I have already prepared the goldthread.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>She definitely wouldn\u2019t be the embarrassed party. I was trying to say that you will be extremely embarrassed if you get beaten by a lady. You even prepared the goldthread?! Prepared it for yourself to drink? </em>Ling Tian speechlessly looked at Ling Jian\u2019s excited expression. At the same time, he could not help but muse in his heart, <em>Poor chap! Just wait to suffer! You are trying to dig a grave for yourself\u2026 this is no different from jumping off a cliff!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, I must fight her no matter what!\u201d Ling Jian insisted. In front of Ling Tian, this was the first time Ling Jian was so insistent on something. It was enough to see just how scarred he was by Li Xue\u2019s actions!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a sigh and said with schadenfreude, \u201cAlright then\u2026 goldthread can also be considered a rare medicine. This is something that will only grow in the wild and tastes pretty good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian left excitedly.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stood in a daze for a long while before shaking his head. <em>It seems like Ling Jian was addicted to drinking goldthread. There are truly too many wonders in the universe. To think that someone would actually get addicted to drinking goldthread\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Ling Tian sighed and walked around in the yard. This yard was connected to the exit of the secret chamber and was an independent existence from the rest of the Courtyard. This was a place that was built under Ling Jian\u2019s orders. There wasn\u2019t a single soul around this place and the only people who were allowed into this yard were all the highest ranking individuals of the Courtyard who would not divulge any secrets. Since Ling Tian intended to remain in hiding for another month, he needed a place to keep himself concealed.</p><br/><p>The moment he entered the yard, Ling Tian felt as though he was in prison. Li Xue, Yu BingYan and the newly added Xiao YanXue would usually coop themselves up in a secret chamber and it would be impossible for ordinary members to see them. In the eyes of the outsiders, both Ling Chen and Ling Jian were the ones with true authority in the Courtyard.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian never imagined that his work would pile up immediately after his return. His plan to take a few days of off for leisure was completely foiled. There was Shui QianRou\u2019s affair, the Shui Family\u2019s affair, Yu BingYan\u2019s affair, and also the fact that Ling Jian insisted on fighting Li Xue\u2026</p><br/><p>At the north, Yu ManLou had already gathered his troops and sought to rule over his half of the continent. He wanted to first pacify any chaos in the southeastern region before sending his troops up north. Only after ensuring that his own backyard is peaceful would he be at ease to set off to conquer other lands. As such, the flags of war were raised in the southeastern region and battle seems to be breaking out at any moment.</p><br/><p>How many more days of peace would he have? Ling Tian let out a long sigh. The biggest headache was the fact that he had to return to the Ling Residence tonight. Who knows how his grandparents and mother were going to torture him? After all, he truly made them worried this time around and he didn\u2019t think that they would let him off so easily. Should he feign injury? Ling Tian began thinking about his little tricks.</p><br/><p>As for the matters with regards to the Ling Family Courtyard, things are much simpler. Ling Tian had already come up with the order by which he would complete his tasks. First, he will settle the problem with Shui QianRou and the Shui Family. After settling them down, he would arrange the battle between Ling Jian and Li Xue. Finally, he would help Yu BingYan remove her Heavenly Negative Locked Meridians.</p></div>\n</div>"}

A thousand years ago, Beyond Heavens experienced boundless glory and chose to hide from the world. While Beyond Heavens is still capable of awing the world, its prestige is no longer the same as before. How does the Beyond Heavens of today compare to Beyond Heavens from a thousand years ago? It is probably worlds apart right!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile Beyond Heavens still has the number one expert and medical saint, and may perhaps be the leading force in the world, how many people in the world have heard of the name Beyond Heavens? The glory of a thousand years ago does not mean your present glory! If this continues for a long period of time, I am certain that Beyond Heavens will not be able to escape the fate of being wiped from the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s words were extremely direct but Justice was not angry in the slightest. He also did not attempt to retort what Ling Tian had said but fell into thought instead,</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Justice, what do you think about what I just said?\u201d Ling Tian asked with a smile that was obviously trying to force Justice into a response.</p><br/><p>Justice fixed his gaze afar and after a long while, he suddenly let out a carefree laugh, \u201cPerhaps Beyond Heavens will disappear from the world after a few generations, but what has that got to do with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am not a moralist and do not have the ambition to save the world from their suffering either. Even in the sect, I am also someone who would never manage anything. The only thing under my management is to exchange a talisman for a life! In this life of mine, I have my own targets and I only seek to pursue the peak of the martial path. My life has been exciting enough and I only seek to live up to my conscience and do as I wish. Why do I have to worry about something that could happen a few decades or centuries later? That shouldn\u2019t be my concern! Furthermore, the Martial Order Medallion has already been trashed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Ling Tian burst out into laughter and clapped his hands, \u201cYou are Justice indeed and do not disappoint me. You are truly carefree!\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone then changed, \u201cThat\u2019s right, there isn\u2019t a need for us to concern ourselves with the future generations. Even if we can leave a legacy for our future generations and have the confidence that our future generations will follow in our footsteps and creating an everlasting legacy, so what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the founding Emperors of history who fought for their territories hoped for their legacy to be continued on forever. However, despite the efforts that they put in, how many empires were able to survive for more than a thousand years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the future generation is useless, even if you hand him an army of celestial beings, he wouldn\u2019t be able to escape the outcome of defeat. If the future generation is capable, even if you don\u2019t leave anything to him, he would be able to use his empty hands to create his own legacy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs everyone in the world born with the riches in their hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s hearty laughter sounded, \u201cIf you are still concerned about the legacy of Beyond Heavens, then there wouldn\u2019t be any hope for you to reach the peak of the martial arts world! Having something to tie you down in your heart is the biggest taboo for someone to pursue the limits! I only wish for my life to be full of excitement and without regrets! So what if the floodwaters cover the entire world after my death?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s bright laughter pierced through the clouds. He then flicked his sleeves and said, \u201cThree days from now, Ling Chen, Li Xue, BingYan, Ling Jian, Ling Chi, Feng Yun, and Lei Dian will be here to fight Justice! This battle will definitely create peerless world experts and will be a legendary battle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s figure had disappeared but everyone remained motionless. Ling Tian\u2019s words had truly shocked them all!</p><br/><p>Justice looked at the leaving Ling Tian with a glow in his eyes. Ever since he met Ling Tian, Ling Tian had given him countless surprises. Both of them had their fair shares of going on offense and defense. With Justice\u2019s peerless martial arts and wisdom, he usually had the upper hand. However, he felt a sense of weakness today for some reason.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t lose out in terms of martial arts but truly saw Ling Tian in a different light because of his words.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Justice truly felt that he could understand Ling Tian\u2019s true feelings!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s objective wasn\u2019t just to rule over the entire world! Ruling over the entire world was no more than a huge game in Ling Tian\u2019s life. Thus, Ling Tian was never afraid of loss and always had a calm disposition!</p><br/><p>He only hoped that he didn\u2019t have any regrets in this life of his! He wanted to lead an exciting life and do as he wished! Regardless of life or death, victory or defeat, it wasn\u2019t much!</p><br/><p>Everything else wasn\u2019t important!</p><br/><p>The only important thing was to lead an exciting life!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I cannot play with the world in my palms, what else is worthy for me to play with in this life?\u201d In the mountains, Ling Tian\u2019s tyrannical and carefree laughter could be heard.</p><br/><p>Loneliness!</p><br/><p>At this moment, only three individuals could feel the endless loneliness that Ling Tian felt in his heart!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I cannot accompany young noble, what is there for me to do in this world?\u201d Ling Chen\u2019s eyes were hazy as she looked in the direction that Ling Tian had disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I do not have you, so what if I am able to tour the celestial palace?\u201d Li Xue\u2019s eyes turned sour and a myriad of emotions filled her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I cannot pursue the peak of the martial arts, there really doesn\u2019t seem to be any other goals in my life.\u201d Justice was filled with stubbornness in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not wish to wield authority within my hands or the peak of the martial arts. I only wish to be your woman and accompany you by your side, watching you every day. Currently, my wish is already fulfilled and I no longer have any other wishes.\u201d Yu BingYan was filled with satisfaction and happiness in her heart. She did not raise her head but Ling Tian\u2019s carefree figure was already imprinted in his heart.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Ling Family Courtyard was bustling with activity!</p><br/><p>Orders were given out one after another that determined the fate of half the continent. At any time and place, there would be rivers of blood and mountain of corpses because of a command given out from the Courtyard.</p><br/><p>Eastern Zhao and Southern Zheng were both stabilized and the management plan for both the empires was carried out orderly. All of the officials who were sent out from Sky Bearing had begun their new jobs and the various departments in the empire began to function normally again. The aftermath of war was slowly being cleared up and the various empires gradually looked as though they were on their way to prosperity.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao and Shen RuHu\u2019s army began to march towards the east.</p><br/><p>Old Master Ling Zhan who was the nominal monarch of Sky Bearing led a leisure life at home. He took care of his plants, reared some fish, and ignored everything else. He left everything else to the Ling Family Courtyard and the Ling Family Courtyard did not fail his expectations either. They settled everything in an orderly and neat fashion.</p><br/><p>The Yu Family\u2019s control of Western Han was also on track and their battle with the Wu Empire was at its peak.</p><br/><p>As compared to the intense battles on the west of the continent, the commoners in Ling Tian\u2019s half of the continent were already walking out from the shadows of war.</p><br/><p>With regards to the borders of Northern Wei, Western Han, and the Wu Empire, Ling Tian sent his army to guard the borders in order to ensure that nothing would go wrong. At this moment, the accumulated wealth of the Ling Family Courtyard had finally shown its might.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s mother, Chu Ting\u2019er, was also invited to the Ling Family Courtyard by Ling Tian to assist Xiao YanXue. With the two fortune deities working together, every single tael of silver was being utilized to its fullest potential. The immense assets of the Ling Family were completely taken out to make plans for the future! They had to ensure that the army would be able to function normally and ensure that future battles would go smoothly.</p><br/><p>All of this was carried out swiftly and efficiently.</p><br/><p>The information net which Ling Tian had laid out in all directions together with the elites of the Crystal Pavilion was deployed by Ling Tian towards the northwest. They had to make ample preparations to deal with the Yu Family!</p><br/><p>To the two parties who were vying for hegemony in Heavenly Star, every second was extremely precious and the situation was extremely tense. Right at this moment, everyone in the Ling Family Courtyard was training their martial arts to improve the strength. They seemed to be even more relaxed than usual\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Seeing the battle in the plaza, Ling Tian cheered.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian, Ling Chi, and the rest had ended their seclusion and walked out of the secret chamber.</p><br/><p>Just as Ling Tian had expected, Ling Jian\u2019s Divine Shocking Dragon Formula had been cultivated to the eighth level and he was the one who improved the quickest. Of course, the pain and tempering that he went through were also the most.</p><br/><p>The powerful energy of the flood dragon inner pellet was indeed extraordinary. It would probably be impossible for anyone in the world to endure the immense energy contained within the inner pellet alone. With Ling Tian\u2019s and Li Xue\u2019s analysis and breakdown, the inner pellet was split into ten parts of different sizes for Ling Tian, Ling Jian, Ling Chi, Ling Feng, Ling Yun, Ling Lei, Ling Dian, Ling Nineteen, Ling Twenty, and Ling Twenty-two.</p><br/><p>With the injection of this immense medicinal effect, Ling Chi had also broken through into the seventh level of the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula. As for the rest, they broke through into the sixth level. The strength of the Ling Family Courtyard had risen by two whole levels at the very least. Such a rapid improvement was enough to shock any martial arts practitioner!</p><br/><p>When Ling Tian appeared from his seclusion, both Li Xue and Justice could immediately feel the change that Ling Tian had gone through. Justice could originally see through Ling Tian\u2019s cultivation level easily but Justice felt as though he could no longer see through Ling Tian any longer. It was as though Ling Tian had transformed into a bewildering fog and there was something blocking his senses.</p><br/><p>Following that, Justice had also noticed the changes in Ling Chi and the rest and could not help but be shocked. Ling Chi and the rest were beaming with a divine light in their eyes and it was obvious that they had recently achieved a breakthrough in their cultivation levels. It was only because they weren\u2019t able to retract their inner qi fully that such a situation would happen. Just what was going on here?!</p></div>\n</div>"}

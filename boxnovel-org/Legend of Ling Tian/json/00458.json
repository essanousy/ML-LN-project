However, I am definitely one of us.\u201d</p><br/><p>This Floating Fragrance Pavilion was one of the secret intelligence bases of the mysterious intelligence organization, Crystal Pavilion. As for Miss QianQian in front of them, she was the person in charge of this secret base. While the Floating Fragrance Pavilion seemed to belong to someone else on the surface, Miss QianQian was the true authority of the place. In the Crystal Pavilion, there were only a few core members who knew that the Crystal Pavilion actually belonged to Ling Tian. As for this QianQian, she was one of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You mean to say that you are not Zhao DaFu?\u201d QianQian had already regained her calm from the previous shock and immediately understood what Ling Tian meant. She then said with an alluring smile, \u201cNo wonder, everytime Zhao DaFu appears here, he would definitely harass Little Guai for a while\u2026 it turns out that you are a different person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Harass that Little Guai? Ling Tian was truly speechless. This Zhao DaFu truly had a unique fetish\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder which ambassador this sir is?\u201d QianQian went back to the main topic and asked with a trace of nervousness and curiosity.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled at her and pointed above his head with a finger, \u201cAbove the heavens!\u201d</p><br/><p>Pa! The teacup in QianQian\u2019s hands fell to the ground and she exclaimed, \u201cYoung noble actually made a personal appearance?\u201d Her expression was then filled with ecstasy and her face turned red from excitement!</p><br/><p>To her, the young noble was a legendary figure too far above her! From a profligate son of a nouveau riche family, he actually managed to leave behind a mark in the world that belonged solely to him. In the news of the Crystal Pavilion, their young noble had actually used the identity of a profligate son to run amok in Sky Bearing, creating wind and rain with the flip of his palm. He fought with the Yang Family, destroyed the imperial family, schemed against the XiMen Family, trapped the NanGong Family and obliterated Northern Wei! While the enemies standing in front of the young noble grew stronger and stronger, his steps remained calm and not a single person was able to stop the steps of their young noble! Every single piece of news regarding their young noble was a legendary deed!</p><br/><p>Up to now he had used his own strength to face the number one expert in the world, the Martial Order Medallion owner Justice! Instead of facing the other small families, their young noble was now facing the largest families in the world today such as the Shui, Yu and Xiao Family!</p><br/><p>His wisdom was not the only respectable point, and his martial arts were even more spectacular! Furthermore, their young noble was still the publicly acknowledged number one scholar! Be it poetry, music, chess, zither, painting or calligraphy, their young noble had achieved a stunning height in all of these things!</p><br/><p>What kind of a genius was this! This was truly a well-rounded genius!</p><br/><p>On top of that, young noble Ling Tian was famous for his suave appearance that would melt the heart of any maiden! He was truly the prince charming of any maiden and the name \u2018Ling Tian\u2019 had turned into a beautiful sweet dream for any maiden!</p><br/><p>When would she be able to meet the young noble? This had turned into the biggest wish of QianQian!</p><br/><p>With her wish finally coming true in front of her, QianQian was agitated to the point she could not think clearly. She felt her heart thumping rapidly as though it was about to jump out of her chest. She then felt her body trembling as her tears almost flowed down from the corner of her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble!\u201d A long while later, QianQian finally came to her senses as she said with a choking voice, kneeling down and kowtowing to Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled calmly and said, \u201cThere is no need to stand on ceremony.\u201d Lifting his arms up lightly, a formless energy enveloped the kneeling QianQian and helped her up.</p><br/><p>A trace of disappointment flashed past QianQian\u2019s eyes. She originally thought that she would be able to feel her young noble\u2019s presence up close if he wanted to help her up. However, she never imagined her young noble could easily help her up from three feet away.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been tough on all of you over the years.\u201d Ling Tian said warmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank\u2026 young noble, this servant\u2026 it isn\u2019t tough.\u201d QianQian was overwhelmed with emotions and the rims of her eyes turned red. With this single phrase of warmth from their young noble, the many years of her hard work were all worth it! Her tears dripped down uncontrollably and feeling how she couldn\u2019t control herself, QianQian could not help but be embarrassed. Just when she was feeling flustered, a clean white handkerchief was sent in front of her.</p><br/><p>Raising her head up, she saw her young noble\u2019s warm gaze with a trace of tenderness. His arm was stretched out and he held onto a clean handkerchief in his hand.</p><br/><p>Receiving the handkerchief with a pair of trembling hands, QianQian could feel the warmth that Ling Tian left behind. After dabbing it lightly on her face to wipe off her tears, QianQian then folded it up carefully and kept it into her bosom.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian originally thought that QianQian would return the handkerchief to him after using it and right when he was about to raise his hand to receive it, he saw QianQian keeping the handkerchief into her bosom. Thus, his hand which was about to stretch out could only be retracted and used to rub his nose. Why do all ladies have such a weird habit? It was Li Xue first and now QianQian.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe main reason for my appearance is to understand the latest news in Bright Jade City and find out where Above Heavens is presently residing. Above Heavens should have more than ten experts gathered together in the same spot. Being in the Yu Family\u2019s territory, they would not dare to split up their forces. Thus, it shouldn\u2019t be too difficult to find them!\u201d After finally being able to settle down this lass\u2019s emotions, Ling Tian quickly expressed his purpose for coming. If he were to allow this lass in front of him to continue crying, he would probably be drowned by tears in no time at all. In less than ten minutes, this lass had already cried twice and was probably catching up to Li Xue already\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, if that\u2019s the case, may young noble wait for a moment.\u201d Talking about business, QianQian was extremely serious. \u201cThis servant will go and get it for young noble.\u201d After which, she turned and walked out.</p><br/><p>A short while later, she carried a huge box and walked in unsteadily. She obviously made use of this time to touch up her makeup and had actually changed into a new dress. Her silk-like hair was tied up into a bun, with her brows like the distant mountains and eyes like the spring waters. The low cut dress which she was wearing displayed the full beauty of her snow-white neck and fully exhibited her curvy figure. She also seemed to have calmed down as she placed the box in front of Ling Tian and said, \u201cAll of the news which we have gathered about the Yu Family over the past two months are in this box. May young noble take a look at it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After pausing for a moment, she said with a trace of guilt, \u201cYoung noble, as for Above Heavens, we do not have concrete news about them right now and we do not have much news about the Xiao Family either. However\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever what?\u201d Ling Tian flipped through the files in front of him and asked distractedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, all the families that behaved oddly have been recorded in this file. Young noble can take a look at it and there may be some important information.\u201d QianQian bent down and took out a file from the box. As she bent down, her snow-white peaks that were compressed had almost popped right out. \u201cThis file contains information of all the martial arts experts who entered the city and other oddities. It contains information up to yesterday afternoon. In this file, we discovered no less than six top-notch experts who snuck into Bright Jade City. Currently, we only have a rough estimate of their location and are unable to pinpoint their exact location. As for whether or not they are from Above Heavens, we are clueless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, this is sufficient.\u201d Ling Tian comforted. With regards to the beautiful scene that QianQian had displayed before his very eyes, he only took a glance before focusing on the file in his hands as though he did not see anything. Upon noticing that, QianQian could not help but have some resentment in her eyes as she thought, I have always been proud of my beauty but could it be so worthless in front of the young noble? Am I not pretty enough or are the young noble\u2019s standards too high?</p><br/><p>As though Ling Tian knew what she was thinking about, he said without lifting his head up, \u201cIt definitely isn\u2019t an easy thing for you to keep your chastity in a brothel. Regardless of who is in front of you, you are still QianQian. Why is there a need for this? Save it for your Mister Right.\u201d How could Ling Tian be unaware of the lass\u2019s thoughts? After going through two lifetimes, how could he be unable to control himself? Furthermore, QianQian was acting no different from those idol chasers in his previous life. If he were to ruin her chastity because of a moment of lust it would truly be a sin.</p><br/><p>QianQian\u2019s eyes turned red and she felt a sense of warmth in her heart. Repeating the words that Ling Tian had said to her, she fell into a daze.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian continued to browse through the files in front of him and was suddenly attracted by something. Yu ManTang and Yu ManTian left for the Lei Family under the orders of Yu ManLou to invite the Lei Family into the continent. The details of the affair were unknown.</p><br/><p>Lei Family? The Lei Family of the Eight Great Families? Ling Tian\u2019s attention was fully captured by this piece of news as he frowned and thought to himself, Why would Yu ManLou want to invite the Lei Family into the continent? Could it be that the Yu Family has a secret agreement with the Lei Family? Or perhaps\u2026 the Yu and Lei Families are closely related? Why was there no news of this in the past?</p><br/><p>No matter what, if the Lei Family was to enter the continent now, they would definitely come into conflict with the various powers of the continent. At that moment, the current balance would definitely be broken! As for whether or not it was a good or bad thing, it was too difficult to predict right now! If the Yu and Lei Families joined forces\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although he was being reprimanded, he felt a sense of bliss and warmth in his heart!</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Yu ManTian was extremely displeased. \u201cOi, who are you talking about? White dressed brat, who are you calling a clumsy bear? This Third Master is just exhausted from my battle with that brat, thus letting you gain the upper hand. Do you really think that your martial arts are higher than this Third Master? What a naive joke! When this Third Master\u2019s injuries are healed, I will exchange pointers with you again to let you know my prowess! Did you hear that brat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Ling Tian said with a mocking smile, \u201cThen was I mistaken just now? Wasn\u2019t the one pathetically running for their life while rolling on the floor you, Third Master?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou b*st*rd!\u201d Yu ManTian stood up in anger. While his life was in the hands of the other party, Third Master Yu was the kind of person who would scold when he wanted to without the least bit of restraint. \u201cWhen this Third Master\u2019s injuries are recovered, I will let you know my prowess! I will let you know why the flowers are red!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Master? So you are the third in line? I wonder what family you belong to?\u201d Ling Tian said with a smile. This \u2018Third Master\u2019 title reminded Ling Tian of some memory, making him think about a falcon in the mountain. [1]</p><br/><p>\u201cI am Third Master of\u2026 why do you care who I am?\u201d Yu ManTian raised his head up proudly. Just when he wanted to reveal his own family, he remembered that he had just been beaten up badly. If he were to reveal his identity, wouldn\u2019t that end up disgracing his Yu Family? Thus, he swallowed the words which were at the very corner of his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, if that\u2019s the case, I won\u2019t say anything more. You treasure my brother, and my brother asked me to spare you. This young noble will not make things difficult for you. Goodbye.\u201d Ling Tian calmly said and walked to Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Yu ManTian quickly called out to them. What a joke, if you are going to leave like that, how am I going to find you when my injuries are recovered? \u201cIt isn\u2019t a problem if you want to leave. You have to first tell me what your name is. What is your brother\u2019s name? Where do you stay at? Where can this Third Master find you brothers?\u201d Yu ManTian asked in a bossy manner. He hadn\u2019t noticed that his body was covered in mud with his clothes in tatters from rolling on the ground. He looked extremely pathetic, and a beggar on the streets was probably better dressed than him!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, Third Master, everyone else calls me \u2018young noble\u2019. You can call me that as well.\u201d Ling Tian said calmly without turning back. Calling yourself \u2018Third Master\u2019, you have already exposed your identity completely and you still think that we don\u2019t know about it? If that\u2019s the case, this young noble will let you have a taste of your own medicine to frustrate you to death!</p><br/><p>Err! Yu ManTian was filled with depression! Thinking about it, it also made sense to him. He refused to answer the other party previously, and the other party would obviously not answer him either.</p><br/><p>Who would be so foolish to expose their identities to their enemy?</p><br/><p>After that short meditation, Yu ManTian felt himself recover a little already. Seeing that Ling Tian was about to leave, he couldn\u2019t help but approach them and say, \u201cThis Third Master here has nothing else better to do, seeing that you are bringing a casualty along, why don\u2019t I protect you guys along the way. Anyway, this person was\u2026 injured by me. Since you guys have already let me off, this Third Master wouldn\u2019t feel good if something happened to you along the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yu ManTian said that, not to mention Ling Tian, even the heavily injured Ling Jian could not help but be dumbfounded. This was the first time they saw someone as thick-skinned as this Third Master Yu!</p><br/><p>He was obviously the one who was beaten up so badly just now, and he actually had the cheek to proclaim that he could protect others!</p><br/><p>As though he also felt slightly embarrassed, Yu ManTian rubbed his head and said, \u201cLet this Third Master tell you, you were only able to gain the upper hand previously because I was exhausted and agitated by this black dressed brat. I am not trying to brag, but if you let this Third Master recover fully, hehe, you will definitely not be my opponent! This Third Master\u2019s inner strength is far denser than yours! Brat, do you dare to admit that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian and Ling Jian stared at each other and couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing! It was as though they had heard the biggest joke in the world, laughing until their bodies rocked back and forth.</p><br/><p>With injuries on his body, Ling Jian began to cough after laughing for a moment. However, he just couldn\u2019t stop himself from laughing, laughing to the point his face was pale.</p><br/><p>Preposterous! Yu ManTian shouted out, \u201cWhat\u2019s so funny? Shall we have another fight now? This Third Master\u2019s inner strength is definitely denser than yours. If I cannot win against you\u2026 if I cannot win against you\u2026\u201d After stuttering for a long while, he just couldn\u2019t complete the sentence. He was well aware of his own condition and he knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to win for sure. While Yu ManTian\u2019s inner strength was indeed denser than Ling Tian\u2019s, it was only limited to his cultivation. As for the other aspects such as martial skills or movement techniques, the two of them were not even on the same level. Even if they were to only compete in inner strength, Yu ManTian might not win. Previously, Ling Tian was able to fight Ye QingChen to a standstill in terms of inner strength. While Yu ManTian\u2019s inner strength was profound, he was still a far cry from Ye QingChen!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian said with a smile, \u201cIf you are not able to reduce me to a state where I am not as suave and carefree as I currently am, will Third Master admit his loss?\u201d As Ling Tian said that, Ling Jian found it even more difficult to control his laughter. The tongue of his young noble was just far too sharp. He was just too good at mocking someone!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian responded with a spitting sound. While he did think that this brat in front of him was suave and carefree, it was impossible for him to admit that fact.</p><br/><p>After a while, Ling Tian said, \u201cSince Third Master doesn\u2019t want to admit his loss, you can just follow us. When you are fully recovered, this young noble will exchange pointers with you again! How about that? Since this brother of mine also seems to think highly of Third Master.\u201d</p><br/><p>In Ling Tian\u2019s heart, he also admired Yu ManTian\u2019s martial arts. The sturdiness of this Third Master was indeed frightening. After fighting Ling Jian for such a long time, being riddled with injuries and having his Inner Qi exhausted, Yu ManTian was still able to withstand three palms from himself! After that, Yu ManTian only spat out a small mouthful of blood and rolled a few times.</p><br/><p>After a short meditation, Yu ManTian was able to jump back up with vigor. The sturdiness of his body could be easily witnessed.</p><br/><p>Ever since Ling Tian was born into this world, apart from Yu QingChen, this Third Master Yu would probably be ranked second amongst all the people he had met!</p><br/><p>Ever since Ling Jian said that he was probably the Third Master of the Yu Family, Ling Tian had immediately guessed his identity. He was originally worried that the colors of this Sky Bearing Gathering would be less vibrant without the Yu Family, but he never expected this Third Master Yu to appear from out of nowhere! To Ling Tian, this was just like a golden ingot that fell from heaven, smashing right into his head! If he didn\u2019t make use of this precious resource, he wouldn\u2019t be called Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>Rejecting Yu ManTian\u2019s desire to follow them had been a lie in the first place. Seeing that he was really anxious, Ling Tian would definitely not chase him away! Instead, he displayed the intentions to befriend him.</p><br/><p>Three people rode on two horses, Ling Tian and Ling Jian on one and Yu ManTian on another. Along the way, the three of them recovered from their injuries as they joked together. With Ling Tian\u2019s eloquence, he was naturally able to easily encourage conversation with Yu ManTian. Yu ManTian was filled with smiles along the way, talking about the national affairs of the continent and completely forgetting how he had just suffered a loss in Ling Tian\u2019s hands! Along the way, they chatted about the various characters on the continent and discussed the different martial arts with a kind of, \u2018heroes of the world, who else can they be but us\u2019, feeling. However, Yu ManTian\u2019s many years of experience were indeed not empty words, and both Ling Tian and Ling Jian felt like they had received plenty from their conversations.</p><br/><p>Along the way, Ling Tian and Ling Jian both joined hands to probe about the Yu Family from Yu ManTian. Of course, they only asked some surface-level questions and Yu ManTian never noticed that the both of them were trying to probe for information. The straightforward Yu ManTian then opened his mouth and talked without restraint about the things he knew.</p><br/><p>The three of them then traveled along slowly, with two wise guys acting foolish and another completely foolish fellow, moving harmoniously towards the Sky Bearing City.</p><br/><p>By the time they arrived at the Sky Bearing City, the three of them were already close to the point of addressing each other as brothers\u2026</p><br/><p>The night was dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cErr, I say, martial arts expert Third Master, do you want to stay at this young noble\u2019s residence? Anyway, this young noble does admire an expert like you, how about that?\u201d Ling Tian was obviously trying to be hypocritically friendly.</p><br/><p>However, this completely described the saying, \u2018despite the thousand considerations of a wise man, he will definitely fail once!\u2019 Ling Tian did not think about what kind of person Yu ManTian was. Even if Ling Tian was just asking out of courtesy, he would definitely take it for real!</p><br/><p>Indeed, as Yu ManTian heard that, he was filled with a temptation to accept Ling Tian\u2019s offer. Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but cry out bitterly in his heart: If this foolish Third Master can\u2019t see the true meaning behind my words and chooses to accept the offer, it will really be \u2018the luck of a foolish man\u2019. What should I do? Bring him to the Ling residence? That obviously isn\u2019t a practical solution!</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Yu ManTian mulled over the matter for a long time before saying with regret, \u201cThank you, but I need to find my niece first and I also have something important to do. Brother, where do you stay at? Why not tell me so we can have a good fight after my injuries are recovered? I really do admire you and that black dressed brat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian rolled his eyes and said, \u201cHehe, Third Master, my house is in this Sky Bearing City and it isn\u2019t time for me to tell you yet. When you are able to find me, we will be considered friends. At that time, I definitely will comply if you want to have a fight! How about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian let out a laugh and said, \u201cAlright, it\u2019s a deal!\u201d At the same time, he thought to himself, In such a small place, wouldn\u2019t it be an extremely easy thing to find someone? Besides, with your martial arts prowess, there will definitely be many who know you in the city.</p><br/><p>[1]: This is a reference to the movie \u2014 The Taking of Tiger Mountain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

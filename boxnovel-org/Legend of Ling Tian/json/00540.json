However, even after eating such a bitter pill this time around, none of the over hundred members dared to even make a squeak!</p><br/><p>On top of the tree, Li Xue let out a light laugh as she said, \u201cI never realized this in the past, but Ling Jian\u2019s words are actually this incisive! For him not to change his occupation to be a bandit, the underworld is really losing out!\u201d</p><br/><p>In contrast, Ling Tian shook his head regretfully, \u201cLing Jian still hasn\u2019t fully mastered it, and can\u2019t speak well. If it was me, I would make sure that all of them would be angered to death after two sentences from me! To think that he only made them faint from anger, how useless!\u201d</p><br/><p>This caused Xiao YanXue to open her mouth in silent shock, as her eyes bulged.<em>Even with Ling Jian\u2019s standard, he still wasn\u2019t satisfied? What sort of person was this guy?!</em></p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao YanXue\u2019s expression, Li Xue couldn\u2019t hold in her laughter. She interjected, \u201cSeems like this sister still doesn\u2019t know the situation. Our dear young noble Ling here takes extreme joy in driving people to their graves by angering them. When you know him long enough, you will realize that any word spoken by this jerk here can cause the dead to start jumping within their graves in anger!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue could not help laughing too. However, her face suddenly turned red as she said in embarrassment, \u201cHow could I not know? I\u2019ve long ago had a taste of it, this jerk is not a good man.\u201d Li Xue nodded her head repeatedly in common understanding, sighing as she replied, \u201cYou make a lot of sense here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stared at them in return. \u201cWhat sort of nonsense are you two silly little girls talking about? How am I not a good person? Just look at me, how could you find someone like me, who\u2019s handsome, elegant, refined, master of brush and sword, an instantly likable person, naive and kindhearted but also pure and without flaws? All those words you said to this young noble were basically to slander and insult me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaive and kindhearted? Pure without flaws?\u201d The two ladies laughed until the branches of the tree started to shake. Using such embellishments on Ling Tian was basically smearing the reputation these few compliments had!</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, this matter still has some loopholes.\u201d After laughing for a moment, Li Xue turned the topic back on track, \u201cIf Yu ManLou finds out about today, he would immediately connect the fact that the First Pavilion has joined the war. This will inevitably reveal the relationship we have with the First Pavilion.\u201d As she spoke, she let out a sigh. \u201cLing Jian shouldn\u2019t have killed the people from both families, for other than us, what other family would have the ability or the influence to benefit from this? Furthermore, with the agreement between you and Yu ManLou agreeing not to infringe each other\u2019s territory within the five years, he will use that to blame you for foul play!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe otherwise!\u201d Ling Tian laughed out. \u201cEven if Yu ManLou were to suspect anything, it would only be a suspicion. He after all still does not have any sort of concrete proof to pinpoint the blame towards our Ling Family. Besides, the time between mine and Justice\u2019s bet still has over a month to go. Within this month, everyone would believe that I\u2019m busy escaping for my life. How would I even have the strength to go about planning such a big event? Thus, Yu ManLou\u2019s thoughts would only stop at suspicions, and based on his mistrustful attitude as well as his habit of doing things after planning everything out, he would not rashly move at this point. After all, he has already started moving towards the Western Han army. Why would he initiate a war on another front? Isn\u2019t that looking for trouble?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithout me at the helm, the Ling Family\u2019s strength would be pushed down in Yu ManLou\u2019s heart. Besides,\u201d Ling Tian suddenly let out a strange smile. \u201cThe most interesting part about this matter is that five hundred first-tier experts from the Above Heavens sect secretly entered the compound of the Yu Family, likely to seek revenge. If we put the two things together, I believe Yu ManLou will definitely start to overthink things. After all, in this age, it\u2019s hard to have an expert, let alone three like those black-robed men. And linking it with the once glorious Above Heaven\u2026 hehehe\u2026\u201d Ling Tian started to maliciously laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s such a matter?\u201d Li Xue furrowed her brows in deep thought. \u201cEven if that\u2019s the case, we still cannot be too careless. Cautiousness will allow a ship to sail for ten thousand years! While Yu ManLou might have suspicions toward Above Heavens, he will still keep a lookout on us. After all, Above Heavens is still half a pugilistic sect and is different from how we operate. We have to guard against this point.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian nodded his head, saying, \u201cThis does make sense. We need to tighten our security then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue was however still pondering about his words, and suddenly asked, \u201cYour meaning just now was that, before the half year bet is up\u2026. For the next month or so you will not show your face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone in the world knows that I\u2019m being pursued by Justice, so why should I risk it and show my face?\u201d Ling Tian sniggered, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be better if I pulled the strings from behind the scenes? Don\u2019t forget our objective, that is to let every single enemy die of anger without knowing why. That\u2019s our greatest joy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of logic is that?!\u201d Li Xue annoyedly huffed before laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re really getting too used to being treacherous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m innocent!\u201d Ling Tian put on a bitter expression, \u201cI\u2019ve also busied myself for so many years, and spent this half a year in countless dangers. Can\u2019t you let me take this month\u2019s time to have a holiday for myself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a holiday? I\u2019m afraid it would make more sense if you were busier this month instead!\u201d Li Xue laughed with some schadenfreude. \u201cInside the Ling Family Courtyard, I believe there are tons of matters waiting for your attention\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be?\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s face changed like he just ate a bitter pill. \u201cI even wanted to take this chance to pick up some chicks\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn your dreams!\u201d \u201cGo and die!\u201d Two offended hmphs were heard, and two hands caught Ling Tian\u2019s ears, one on each side, twisting with force. Ling Tian screamed out in misery, begging humbly to be spared.</p><br/><p>It seems as though this ancient tool of women was highly effective even when against an expert of martial arts!</p><br/><p>Below them, the various warriors of the Ling Family unrestrainedly picked up the jewels and gold strewn all over the place, slowly categorizing them and placing them within the boxes prepared. They even wiped down each object before placing them in, really paying attention to all details.</p><br/><p>As for the Shui Family, after a short period of rest, they began to collect the bodies of their partners, burying them. Both sides had their respective jobs, and no one interfered in the other, making the process seem extremely streamlined.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian stood in his white robes at the side, his arms crossed with an icy expression on his face. The Elders of Shui Family seemed to wish to speak with him, but every time they walked near him, they would give up on their thoughts and return to their original location without a single word. Ling Jian\u2019s posture fully displayed his attitude: No bargaining or negotiations! While the Shui Family was unsatisfied, looking at someone of Ling Jian\u2019s caliber, they could only pinch their noses in resentment.</p><br/><p>Finally, the Shui Family woodenly finished their jobs, carrying stomachs full of pain as well as the resentment towards the Ling Family as they returned to the city. Before they left, they did not even bother to bid farewell to Ling Jian and the rest.</p><br/><p>As Ling Jian watched them leave, his face grew colder, and the killing intent thicker. The aura on his body fluctuated nonstop, and it was after a long while that he finally snorted coldly, turning his back to them.</p><br/><p>If not for the sake of the plan, just their lack of politeness was enough to make Ling Jian slaughter all of them! Ling Jian had zero good impressions towards this group of Shui Family members, feeling that this group was just too untactful!</p><br/><p>After a long time, the Ling Family warriors gathered most of the missing treasure, categorizing it into the different wagons. They actually filled up three huge wagons! This even made Ling Tian exclaim from the trees. He could not help but praise the conscientious efforts of the Yu Family members. They really embodied the point of \u2018becoming rich through one\u2019s own efforts\u2019!</p><br/><p>Li Xue twisted her mouth, nodding her head below, \u201cLook clearly, that great assassin there had actually brought ten wagons here today!\u201d Ling Tian smiled, and craning his neck down, he saw Ling Jian gazing at the other empty seven wagons, an expression of not knowing whether to laugh or cry plastered on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy can finally reveal a human expression! Furthermore, he seemed to have gazed a few times toward our location, with respect in his eyes! Could it be that he had discovered your presence?\u201d Li Xue looked at Ling Tian in astonishment. \u201cHow did he achieve that? He could not discover me but actually managed to discover you. Isn\u2019t that weird?\u201d</p><br/><p>After promoting further in his cultivation, Ling Tian\u2019s movement techniques had already outstripped that of Li Xue\u2019s, and not just by a small amount. However, Ling Jian could actually detect the presence of Ling Tian! This was an oddity that was difficult to explain.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian only smiled deeply as he slowly spoke, \u201cWhen two people have come into contact with each other often enough, there would be some mysterious resonance between both parties. Through this resonance, which we usually call telepathy, two people can detect each other around a certain distance. Little lass, do you understand now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh! What telepathy, you\u2019re talking about intuition, right? Do men even have intuition?\u201d Li Xue turned her nose up. \u201cThat\u2019s the specialty of us women!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong! Not only do men have some sort of intuition, but their intuition is largely accurate!\u201d Ling Tian rebuked. \u201cAs for the intuition of women, it lies mainly within the domain of relationships, and is extremely unfathomable! But the telepathy I\u2019m talking about regarding two people is not an intuition, but rather a mysterious sort of sense. It\u2019s difficult to put into words, but it definitely exists. If not for the fact that Ling Jian deeply respects me from the bottom of his heart, there would not be such a response. This part has to do with this young noble\u2019s charm! Are you guys surprised, envious maybe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the display of shamelessness coming out of Ling Tian, he immediately suffered the wrath of two angered ladies.</p><br/><p>Underneath, Ling Jian saw that the mission had been accomplished, and sent the order to leave. In accordance with Ling Tian\u2019s expectations he indeed left behind a carriage parked in a clearing within the forest, and imperceptibly bent his body towards their direction, before leaving in large steps.</p><br/><p>The young noble was back, but since he chose not to show himself, he definitely had his reasons. So long as he knew that Ling Tian was safe, that was the best news for Ling Jian!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was clear about what he could and could not do, thus he knew what move he was supposed to take next!</p></div>\n</div>"}

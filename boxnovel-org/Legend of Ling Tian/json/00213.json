If we delay the purging of the poison, then the consequences will be disastrous! Dare I ask Your Majesty something? If anything untoward happens to Consort Ling, then will the Empress be willing to bear the responsibility?!\u201d A hint of warning revealed itself in her tone, especially focusing on the words \u2018then the consequences will be disastrous!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Madam Ling, your words are too severe. This Empress doesn\u2019t know anything about the purging of poison, so what\u2019s wrong with going in to take a look? My relationship with Sister Ling has always been good, don\u2019t tell me Old Madam Ling is unwilling to even let me see my sister? What kind of words are you speaking?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the great blessings from the Empress herself, my aunt narrowly passed the doors of death. She is out of danger now.\u201d Following this voice thick with fatigue, Ling Tian stepped out from inside the room, a frightening smile hung on his handsome face. A portion of his hair, still matted with sweat, hung on his face, and while he looked a little bedraggled, his eyes were bright and clear, full of an awe-inspiring brilliance.</p><br/><p>Empress Yang Xue locked gazes with Ling Tian. As the empress of a nation, she was already used to giving looks of contempt to those under her, but what she saw in Ling Tian\u2019s eyes today gave her palpitations. That penetrating, frosty gaze seemed to be able to see through all her secrets, throwing her into disarray.</p><br/><p>\u201cTian\u2019er, how\u2019s your aunt? Are she and her child safe?\u201d Long Xiang rushed up, stretching his head to peer into the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth mother and child are out of the woods,\u201d Ling Tian spoke, and after sweeping Yang Xue with a look, he indifferently continued, \u201cHowever, my aunt\u2019s body is still weak, and the most important thing is to nurse back her health using tonics; the tonics can\u2019t be too strong or too Yin in nature. Another matter is that this incident is definitely not an accident, and there\u2019s a very well hidden plot inside this whole scheme. Royal Uncle, to think that there\u2019s actually someone inside the Royal Palace that dares to harm your consort, as well as your Royal Child\u2026 hehehe, our Ling Family finds this matter inconceivable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Your majesty, while Ran\u2019er is only a consort, she is still the daughter of the Ling Family. To actually meet with such a matter inside the Imperial Palace, this really fills the old woman with apprehension.\u201d Hearing that her daughter was fine, Old Madam Ling felt the burdens in her heart suddenly lift. \u201cYour Majesty, our Ling Family has always been loyal and devoted towards you, but to think that someone actually plots to assassinate our daughter here! Will your Majesty please be the judge, and help to find the culprit!\u201d As she finished, Old Madam Ling actually kneeled and kowtowed to the Emperor, her face filled with tear streaks.</p><br/><p>Long Xiang emotionally replied, \u201cOld Madam, please rise. This matter is all this Emperor\u2019s fault due to being too lax with the security. Rest assured, We will issue an arrest warrant for that Su HuaiRen as well as the palace maid Little Chrysanthemum, to give an answer to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Old Madam Ling stood up and unhappily said, \u201cYour Majesty must be joking, how could a mere imperial physician as well as a palace maid even dare to plot against the Royal Consort? There must be a mastermind behind all this! And the mastermind should have considerable power in the Imperial Palace! If we can\u2019t unveil the true identity of the mastermind, then these incidents will happen again, putting everyone in danger! If the core of the city is not safe, then how can the country remain unmoved in times of crisis?!\u201d Old Madam Ling\u2019s words were scalding, partly due to the fact that her daughter almost passed through the door of death, and partly because she sensed that the Emperor was trying to soothe down this matter.</p><br/><p>The few sentences of Old Madam Ling was as good as putting a target board on Empress Yang Xue\u2019s head! Yang Xue was never on good terms with Ling Ran, with the two of them constantly warring underground. Yang Xue was a petty person, easily jealous, so how could Long Xiang not be aware of it? If anything untoward happened to the Royal Consort, the biggest benefactor would be the Empress! As such, given the relations between the two families, how could the Ling Family not take the chance to viciously target the Yangs now?</p><br/><p>Long Xiang was also clear that there was at least a ninety percent probability that Yang Xue was behind this, but he was at his wit\u2019s end when facing the two behemoths!</p><br/><p>Now that Sky Bearing was in an unstable situation, with all sort of experts converging here, he wasn\u2019t able to guard against everyone harboring ill intentions! Only by borrowing the power of the Ling and Yang families would he be able to resist the other great families, making the other powers hesitant to take advantage of this situation.</p><br/><p>Of the three major powers in Sky Bearing, the imperial, Yang and Ling families, the Yang Family had always been the most powerful. Thus, Long Xiang made use of the Ling Family in order to restrict and control the Yang Family. Other than showering Ling Ran with more love, he was also very protective of the Ling\u2019s 3rd generation heir, Ling Tian. Ling Tian, with his arrogance and domineering attitude, could survive until today not only because he didn\u2019t go overboard, but because of the Emperor\u2019s shielding! This was the way of ensuring the loyalty of the Ling Family to maintain balance in the Empire.</p><br/><p>However, the current times had changed, and the winds of fortune had begun blowing another way. By thwarting the Western Han\u2019s expansion plans again and again and achieving many military merits, the soldiers started to call Ling Xiao the \u2018God of War\u2019. In addition, Chu Ting\u2019er had become a mover and shaker of the commerce world with her sharp intellect, earning her the title of \u2018Goddess of Fortune\u2019. Recently, there was even a rumor claiming that they had a relationship with the otherworldly hidden sect \u2018Beyond Heavens\u2019, which gave Long Xiang a sense of fear.</p><br/><p>If it had stopped there, it still would have been acceptable since the Ling Family didn\u2019t have any intention of expanding their influence. However, of all times the marriage alliance between the NanGong and the Yang families just had to collapse, turning them into enemies. With the Yang Family\u2019s influence suddenly waning, the balance of the three could no longer be maintained, and this gave Long Xiang many worries.</p><br/><p>Of all the times, this sort of assassination had to then take place! While the Ling Family was definitely the victims this time, he could not immediately deal with Yang Xue as she was his only link to the Yang Family! If the Yang Family were to be unhappy and turn rogue, then in such sensitive times, how could the Sky Bearing Imperial Palace be able to withstand the external pressure?</p><br/><p>But if he didn\u2019t deal with this matter, then how could he give the Ling Family an answer? With their current power and influence, how would they be willing to suffer in silence? All of a sudden, Long Xiang could feel a headache brewing.</p><br/><p>At the side, Empress Yang Xue\u2019s expression changed, commenting in an icy voice, \u201cDoes Old Madam Ling believe that this Empress is the perpetrator behind all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling merely sniggered, \u201cHow would this old woman dare to accuse the Empress? If your majesty doesn\u2019t have anything to do with this, then why would you be in such a hurry to defend yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Empress Yang Xue\u2019s retort was stuck in her throat. Old Madam Ling\u2019s words hinted that she had a guilty conscience, which sent her mental state into a panic. She however stubbornly tried to twist the logic, saying, \u201cBut by all means, your words are not what a subject of the imperial court should say. How the matter is to be dealt with would be completely up to the Emperor himself, but Old Madam Ling\u2019s words are actually coercing the Emperor. As a subject, to despise the Emperor, that is an unforgivable crime!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian interjected in at this point with a grim smile, \u201cMy grandmother\u2019s words a moment ago were akin to a suggestion made by the commoners. There is a need to uphold righteousness in the world, and whether or not is is reasonable, the suggestion would still be heard by the country. Now the Emperor hasn\u2019t opened his mouth, but as Empress of the country, you have actually retorted first, meddling in the country\u2019s affairs. Then where do you place the Emperor? Doesn\u2019t that mean you don\u2019t respect his authority?! As for the unforgivable crime Your Majesty mentioned, who then is guilty of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>As a person who had seen two lifetimes, how quickwitted was he? In a flash, he had escalated an internal court matter to the affairs of the country, and added in the tag of \u2018Empress overriding her husband\u2019s authority\u2019 to Yang Xue! How could Yang Xue be as quickwitted as Ling Tian? She was left gaping like a fish, unable to utter a single word!</p><br/><p>Seeing the two families verbally attacking each other, and actually quarreling in front of him, Long Xiang felt a huge sense of powerlessness. When he suddenly saw how Ling Tian effectively shut Yang Xue up with a single sentence, an idea sprouted up in his heart, giving him a plan to temporarily maintain the balance of the two families, as well as dissipate the Ling Family\u2019s hate.</p><br/><p>He coughed once to interrupt them, before saying, \u201cThis matter has not been fully unveiled yet and who is the actual culprit remains to be seen. The accusations can wait until we actually get ahold of our suspects. However, to actually get a concubine without letting your royal uncle know, you make me very sad, Tian\u2019er. I couldn\u2019t even get a cup of wine to drink from your wedding, and for that you need to be punished!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started in shock. The Emperor actually forcefully diverted the conversation to the topic of marriage, why did he do that? This change was too abrupt, but he was the Emperor, so what could they do?</p><br/><p>The Old Madam was a wily old fox and could tell that the Emperor didn\u2019t want to get tangled up in this matter just yet. Luckily, both mother and child were safe so they currently had an advantage. She didn\u2019t continue to speak because the timing was also unsuitable for them to rise up against the Empress. However, she knew that she would not let it rest just like that. The Ling Family never allowed anyone to take advantage of them!</p><br/><p>Seeing that his grandmother had calmed down, Ling Tian naturally understood that his grandmother had her schemes, and thus laughed while replying, \u201cRoyal Uncle is always preoccupied with so many national affairs, how would Ling Tian dare to invite you over every small matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Long Xiang laughed heartily as he responded, \u201cBut to take a concubine before you even have an actual wife is rather eccentric. How about this, Old Madam?\u201d He turned to Old Madam Ling with a warm smile on his face, \u201cUsing my authority, I\u2019ll betroth Jiao Yue over to Ling Tian, allowing her to be his official wife. I wonder if Old Madam would agree to this arrangement?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

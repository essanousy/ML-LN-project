Furthermore, even after the waterway is unblocked, the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass would no longer be the natural barrier that it was. At the same time, Ling Tian would never give the Xiao Family a chance to stage a comeback. Ling Tian would definitely seize this strategic location and the Xiao Family\u2019s natural barrier would be transformed into the Ling Family\u2019s battle station!</p><br/><p>After losing a large number of soldiers and causing their people to lose their wealth, the Xiao Family would not have any ability to contend with the Ling Family!</p><br/><p>As long as Ling Tian cleared up the current mess, he would be able to stably sit on half the continent.</p><br/><p>A flood which should have never happened had actually created such a huge effect!</p><br/><p>His victory with Yu ManLou\u2019s five-year bet was determined!</p><br/><p>No wonder their young noble would spend so much effort to dam up this huge river! Thinking about the benefits that diverting the river brought them, Ling Jian finally understood what Ling Tian\u2019s plan was!</p><br/><p>However, only their young noble had the ability to make such a plan into reality. Even if someone else was able to come up with such a plan, how would they have the ability to dam up the river?</p><br/><p>Looking at Ling Tian who was standing by the cliff, everyone could not help but be filled with reverence in their hearts!</p><br/><p>A human was actually able to perform such a miracle that only a deity can perform!</p><br/><p>\u201cI never imagined obtaining such unexpected gains.\u201d After carefully studying the water level, Ling Tian was finally at ease. With both the mountain peaks collapsing, it was like a gigantic dam separating the upstream from the downstream. The water level of the upstream increased and the downstream\u2026 the downstream no longer had any water and was drying up.</p><br/><p>At the highest point of the dam, it was still about a hundred feet away from the water. It was impossible for the river water to rush through the dam because it had already begun flowing in all different directions and towards the battlefield\u2026</p><br/><p>The many members of the Xiao Family would definitely receive a huge \u2018surprise\u2019!</p><br/><p>Being at ease, Ling Tian could finally study that \u2018aboriginal\u2019 gigantic snake.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian never imagined that this explosion would give him such a unique complimentary gift. The head of the snake in front of him was as thick as a water tank and the body of the snake was probably 50% thicker than the head. For a snake to grow to such a humongous size, at least 800 to a thousand years would probably be required.</p><br/><p>Such a gigantic snake was enough to be called a demon. If he didn\u2019t dissect this gigantic snake, it would be a waste of the heaven\u2019s blessing.</p><br/><p>This gigantic snake was also extremely unlucky. It was originally having a good rest after its meal but was rendered unconscious by the sudden explosion. After finally regaining consciousness, it tried fleeing towards the outside. In the end, the cave over its head collapsed down and a gigantic boulder smashed on its weakest point\u2026 In all of its life, it probably never dreamt that it would die such an unjust death\u2026</p><br/><p>If it chose to hide in the cave obediently, even if the mountain collapsed, it would only suffer some injuries and fall back into the river. However, it was frightened by the previous explosion and had tried to escape from the cave\u2026 as such, the tragedy unfolded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn! What a gigantic snake!\u201d Ling Chi finally snapped back from his daze and realized that there was another unlucky fellow near him. This fellow was already addicted to Ling Tian\u2019s barbecued food and upon seeing a live animal, he was used to thinking, \u2018Is it fat? Is it yummy?\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>With a \u2018hmph\u2019, Ling Tian lifted up his sword and sliced off the head of the snake without a single shred of mercy. The purplish blood of the snake spurted out and apart from a dense fishy smell, there was actually a fragrant plant scent.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian quickly took out a jade bottle from his embrace and licked the blood of the snake. In Ling Tian\u2019s memories, even though snake\u2019s blood was a supplement, this was the first time Ling Tian had seen such a gigantic snake. Before he could be certain of whether or not there was venom in the blood, Ling Tian would not allow Ling Jian and the rest to drink it. If he were to test it first, even if there was venom in the blood, he would be able to endure it with his inner strength of the tenth level of the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula. However, the others may not be able to endure it.</p><br/><p>As the snake blood went down his throat, it was not as spicy as Ling Tian imagined it to be but had a freshness to it instead. Knowing that the blood had no venom, Ling Tian stopped suppressing it with his inner qi and used his inner qi to speed up the absorption of the snake\u2019s blood instead. After a complete circulation, Ling Tian\u2019s inner qi returned to his inner core and Ling Tian felt a slight wave of heat surging through his body before quickly dissipating. At the same time, his spirit was also lifted.</p><br/><p>Not only did the snake\u2019s blood not contain any venom, it was also rather beneficial. Ling Tian had consumed the best spiritual herbs before and the top quality Great Cyclic Pellet. It was difficult for ordinary herbs to have a large effect on Ling Tian anymore but the snake\u2019s blood was actually capable of creating a reaction in his body. The effect of the blood was naturally extraordinary!</p><br/><p>After coming to a conclusion, Ling Tian opened his eyes, \u201cEveryone is in luck. All of you should drink some of the snake\u2019s blood. Not only is the blood not venomous, it is beneficial to one\u2019s cultivation. But even if it is beneficial to the body, it wouldn\u2019t be good to drink too much of it. Everyone should be limited to a single bowl.\u201d Although there wasn\u2019t venom in the blood, Ling Tian was still worried. Snake\u2019s blood had an aphrodisiac effect, and even the blood of an ordinary snake was a great supplement. All of Ling Tian\u2019s subordinates who followed him here were all young and vigorous men. If their hormones were to go out of control right now, it would be an unbearable feeling for sure. Being in the depths of the mountains, there wasn\u2019t a place for them to vent their urges\u2026</p><br/><p>The moment they heard that there wasn\u2019t venom, everyone was immediately energized and rushed forward to swallow the snake\u2019s blood. With such a beneficial supplement in front of them, how could they be bothered about the one bowl limit that Ling Tian said? Each person quickly swallowed a couple of bowls.</p><br/><p>After drinking a couple mouthfuls, Ling Tian took out two jade bottles and filled them up. Thinking about how his body felt a wave of warmth when consuming the snake\u2019s blood, Ling Tian wanted to bring it back to see if it was beneficial for Divine Black Negative Meridians.</p><br/><p>With the combined efforts of everyone, the gigantic boulder that was pressing down on the snake was moved. Only after a full hour of effort were they finally able to uncover the huge snake.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy goodness, is this still considered a snake?\u201d a burly man shouted as he looked at the gigantic corpse in amazement. \u201cThis fellow is far too big! I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this fellow can swallow a cow whole! I dare to make a bet that even three to five cows aren\u2019t enough to feed this snake. No wonder we didn\u2019t see any large beasts along the way here. All of them were probably eaten up by this fellow.\u201d</p><br/><p>According to Ling Tian\u2019s estimates, the thickest cross-sectional area of this fifteen meter long snake was at least two square meters and the overall weight of this snake was two to three thousand catties at the very least!</p><br/><p>Everyone was astounded.</p><br/><p>Just how did a snake grow to such a size? When Ling Jian was drifting around the continent, he had once killed a three to four hundred-year-old snake. The body of that snake was also extremely large but in comparison to this gigantic snake, it was akin to comparing a rabbit to a pig!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re rich!\u201d After seeing the layer of exquisite scales on the snake, Ling Tian tried pulling one off with his hands. Seeing that it wouldn\u2019t budge, Ling Tian put away his Heaven Splitter and grabbed the blade of one of his subordinates. Swinging it down on the snake, he was only able to make a small mark on the snake\u2019s scales.</p><br/><p>Even though the blade was forged from ordinary iron, the edge of the blade was tempered by Black Iron. Together with Ling Tian\u2019s strength, even if he didn\u2019t use all of his might, it was enough for him to slice through steel like it was mud. However, Ling Tian was only able to make a small mark on the snake! The toughness of the snake\u2019s skin was unimaginable!</p><br/><p>With the gigantic body of this snake, just how many pieces of soft armor would they be able to make?! If Ling Tian could equip some of his Ling Family Courtyard subordinates with this armor and also forge a top quality armor for his father, he wouldn\u2019t need to always worry for his father\u2019s safety. Especially Ling Jian and the other assassins of the First Pavilion, if they put on a soft armor of this quality, they would be virtually unkillable when carrying out an assassination! With Ling Jian\u2019s assassination standards, if he had such a heaven-defying piece of equipment, how many people in the world would be able to escape from him?</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Ling Tian almost wanted to let out a loud roar of excitement!</p><br/><p>The Heaven Splitter left its sheath again and Ling Tian carefully peeled off the skin of the snake; only this ancient sword would be able to damage this extremely tough snake skin. Ling Tian then carefully cut it up into more than ten pieces and commanded his subordinates to carry it on their backs before continuing to dissect the snake in seek of treasures.</p><br/><p>With regards to dissecting a snake, Ling Tian was extremely familiar with it. He first made an incision at the seventh part of the snake where the gallbladder and other goodies of the snake lay.</p><br/><p>The first thing which Ling Tian retrieved was the gallbladder. The gallbladder of such a mythical creature was definitely a sacred item that could cure poison and Ling Tian would definitely not let go of it. Holding the gallbladder in his hand, Ling Tian gasped at the weight of it as it was close to the weight of three bear gallbladders.</p><br/><p>After keeping the gallbladder of the snake into a purse of his bag, Ling Tian continued dissecting the snake. However, Ling Tian\u2019s expression gradually became intent this time around. After searching throughout the body of the snake countless times, Ling Tian finally stood up with frustration.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Why isn\u2019t there an inner pellet?! Isn\u2019t this too exaggerated? An old monster like this should be the king of snakes at the very least, right?! There isn\u2019t anything else that\u2019s of value other than the skin and meat?\u201d Ling Tian looked at the snake and cursed, \u201cAren\u2019t you a little too useless? You actually didn\u2019t condense an inner pellet? How can it be missing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Young Noble Ling looked thoroughly enraged as though he was furious that this snake did not condense a powerful inner pellet. The tone with which he cursed the snake was as though the snake owed him a living. He was just far too shameless\u2026</p><br/><p>The more he looked at the snake\u2019s corpse, the more enraged Ling Tian was and kicked it furiously, \u201cSlice of the meat of this fellow and we are going to have a snake banquet tonight! After having a good meal, we will carry the rest away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone cheered loudly with Ling Chi\u2019s voice being the loudest. Knowing that they were going to have a feast, they all pounced forward like starving wolves.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Noble, what is an inner pellet? This subordinate has never heard of such a thing before. May Young Noble instruct me,\u201d Ling Jian asked with a tinge of frustration. This was a question that everyone pondered about but only Ling Jian had the right to ask Ling Tian about it!</p><br/><p>\u201cInner pellet? How\u2026 how should I explain this? Wild beasts that are alive for a long time have a powerful life force and will not die easily. When this life force accumulates to a certain point together with them swallowing the essence of the heaven and earth, a mystical essence similar to the essence of heaven and earth would be formed in their bodies. This would also be the quintessence of the beast. This quintessence of the beast is extremely beneficial to all living beings! It is even more beneficial to martial arts practitioners. Most beasts that have been alive for a few hundred years will form such an essence but this snake that is more than a thousand years old actually did not form an inner pellet. This is also extremely strange.\u201d Ling Tian scratched his chin and looked at his subordinates slicing off the flesh of the meat while sinking into deep thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I see,\u201d Ling Jian nodded his head with understanding. \u201cI killed a gigantic black snake before and sliced its head apart with my sword. There was a small black stone within it but it was a little soft\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can\u2019t be right, the inner pellet of a snake should be condensed at its weakest point and is usually at the seventh part of a snake. Why would it be at the head of the snake?\u201d Ling Tian asked with doubt and looked at the head of the snake which was already cut off. \u201cLet\u2019s give it a try anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian lifted up his sword and walked over while asking casually, \u201cHow did you deal with that snake? A black snake is good stuff and a black snake that is capable of forming an inner pellet is even more extraordinary.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face reddened and he lowered his head, \u201cI threw that thing to Old Feng when I returned to the Courtyard and Old Feng brewed a jug of wine with it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat! Using an inner pellet to brew wine?!\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s eyes widened in shock and looked at Ling Jian with his jaw wide opened, \u201cWas Old Feng not afraid of being bloated to death? Dammit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Talking about that, Ling Jian replied with a smile, \u201cDuring that period of time, Old Feng was extremely energetic and continuously ran to the brothel for two months. Every time he went, he would spend a full day there and the ladies there did not dare to receive him alone\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s veins bulged and his eyes glowed with malevolence. \u201cAn extremely rare inner pellet of the black snake was used by Feng Mo as an aphrodisiac??? Dammit, he is truly trampling on such a heavenly item.\u201d The more he thought about it, the more furious Ling Tian got. \u201cAh\u2019Jian, I really want to smack you to death for your idiocy. Did you know that if I guided you in consuming the inner pellet, it would be equivalent to two Great Cyclic Pellets and it would not conflict with the medicinal effects of the Great Cyclic Pellet? In a single night, you would be able to gain sixty years worth of cultivation! It would be equivalent to two of you bundled together! However, you actually gave it to Old Feng to brew wine?! I am utterly impressed with the two of you! What is called a waste of heavenly treasures?! This is a waste of heavenly treasures!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian almost puked blood and had completely forgotten slice open the snake\u2019s head, \u201cThat Old Feng is also too much! Since he didn\u2019t know how to use it, he should know how to ask at the very least, right?! He could come and ask this young noble instead of pretending that he knew how to use it! Even if he wanted to brew it in wine, he actually chose to vent the medicinal effect in the brothel after consuming it\u2026 He truly wasted this heavenly supplement on a bunch of prostitutes. I\u2026 I am really going to puke blood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian listened with his mouth wide open with shock and his face transformed from red to white before turning ashen. He jumped up in utter regret and started scratching his head as though he had turned crazy and turned around two times on the spot. He then sat on the ground with his soul in despair without saying a single word!</p><br/><p>He had actually given away such a rare treasure and brushed by the chance to become an unparalleled expert! To Ling Jian who pursued the peak of martial arts, such news was as good as the heavens collapsing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI once had the chance to turn into an unparalleled expert in a single night but I didn\u2019t treasure it. By the time I understood it, I was filled with utter regret. If the heavens would give me another chance\u2026\u201d Ling Jian muttered under his breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Ling Tian kicked Ling Jian, \u201cWhere did you learn this from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian raised his perplexed eyes and let out a soulless sigh, \u201cWhen I was injured in Northern Wei and sent back to Sky Bearing by Miss Li Xue, I heard her mumble these few words. I didn\u2019t think much about these few words back then but now that I find about this matter, haiz\u2026 I truly understand the meaning of those words\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>As someone from the modern generation, Ling Tian naturally knew where these words came from. However, he never expected Ling Jian to pick it up from her and copy it word for word.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry!</p><br/><p>However, what Ling Tian didn\u2019t know was that Li Xue\u2019s abuse of Ling Jian had started from these words. When Li Xue was recalling these words, she thought about the many events of her previous life and became extremely depressed. As she muttered these words, Ling Jian who was in a bad mood from being injured mocked her and it became the beginning of Ling Jian\u2019s nightmare. Not anyone in the world can mock the demoness and even Ling Tian didn\u2019t have the guts to do so\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at Ling Jian\u2019s soulless expression, Ling Tian could not bear to continue reprimanding him and sighed, \u201cThis is life and fate. If you do not have the fate, you cannot force it. Old Feng originally had the fate but he wasted it. Let us see if there is an inner pellet in this snake\u2019s head. If there is one, we can make up for your loss slightly. If there isn\u2019t, you will just have to cultivate slowly and occasionally become the sandbag of me and Li Xue\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will definitely be one.\u201d Hearing this suggestion, Ling Jian\u2019s eyes narrowed and his body trembled slightly. His gaze was fixed firmly onto the head of the snake with a fiery gaze as though he was looking at his dream come true. The malevolent head of the snake was suddenly so beautiful in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian turned around and slashed his sword down at the snake\u2019s head.</p></div>\n</div>"}

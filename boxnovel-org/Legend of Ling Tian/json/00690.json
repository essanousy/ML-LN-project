It was a complete joke from the beginning to the end! With Xiao YanXue\u2019s cultivation, she probably didn\u2019t even have the ability to go anywhere near the battle!</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Jian stand in the middle of the hall like a celestial with his sword suppressing the dozens of Above Heavens experts around him without a single person daring to make a move, Xiao YanXue had a sudden sense of pride in her heart!</p><br/><p>This is the man who she had eyes for!</p><br/><p>In the world today, how many of such men would there be?</p><br/><p>But after feeling a sense of pride, she had endless fear in her heart. Regardless of how spectacular Ling Jian\u2019s martial arts were, he was only a single person. While he seemed to be suppressing the experts of Above Heavens at the moment, the moment he killed Meng FanYun, there wouldn\u2019t be the slightest bit of chance for him to escape!</p><br/><p>If Ling Jian didn\u2019t kill Meng FanYun and attempted to make a full retreat, the countless Above Heavens experts may be able to keep him from leaving!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Jian couldn\u2019t leave! Even if he wanted to leave, he had to first kill Meng FanYun before leaving!</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue was extremely flustered in her heart. Just what should she do? Just how could she save this fellow after he completed his assassination?</p><br/><p>Meng FanYun looked at Ling Jian with his eyes gleaming and suddenly said, \u201cSir Pavilion Head, at this moment, both of us are extremely clear that none of us dares to make a move! If my experts make a move first, I will definitely be the first to take a step onto the yellow springs road and this is something that my Above Heavens cannot accept. If Sir makes a move first, even if I die, you will definitely not be able to leave alive! Under the combined attack of fifty to sixty XianTian experts, even if you are Justice, so what?\u201d</p><br/><p>He then said with a smile, \u201cThe way I see it, why don\u2019t we each take a step back and make friends with each other?\u201d Meng FanYun had misjudged the situation and thought that Ling Jian didn\u2019t attack because he was afraid of being trapped in an encirclement. Thus, this Above Heavens Sect Master attempted to negotiate with Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian seemed to be in deep thought, pondering over what Meng FanYun had said. Meng FanYun was elated and continued, \u201cPavilion Head roams unhindered in the world and there isn\u2019t a single person who doesn\u2019t admire your name. I have already been severely injured by Pavilion Head and even if Pavilion Head leaves now, it wouldn\u2019t leave a stain on Pavilion Head\u2019s majestic name! Pavilion Head is an intelligent man and should naturally know how to make your choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Two cold beams shot out from Ling Jian\u2019s eyes and he said coldly, \u201cThere are something that you are right about. If your men make a move first, you will die! If I make a move first, you will die! Regardless of which party makes a move first, you will definitely be the first to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng FanYun snorted, \u201cHowever, the second to die will definitely be you!\u201d</p><br/><p>A tinge of laughter could be seen in Ling Jian\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Meng FanYun thought that he had persuaded Ling Jian and heaved a sigh of relief, only to hear Ling Jian say, \u201cNot necessarily!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng FanYun flew into a rage and said, \u201cNot to mention the First Pavilion Head, even if the number one expert in the world, Justice, was standing in your place, he would definitely be dead in the face of the full strength of my Above Heavens!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? What big words! Is that really the truth?\u201d Ling Jian said coldly.</p><br/><p>At the same time, another voice drifted in from outside the hall, \u201cSect Master Meng\u2019s words are truly bold. This seat is extremely interested to find out what kind of strength is capable of killing this seat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng FanYun\u2019s face changed! <em>Why would he be here?!</em></p><br/><p><em>Martial Order Medallion owner Justice! He is here!</em></p><br/><p><em>The heavens want my death!</em></p><br/><p>Meng FanYun never imagined that his luck would be so terribly bad! In order to persuade the number one assassin in front of him, he had mentioned the number one expert in the world as an example. It was only normal for the number one expert in the world to be superior to the number one assassin. However, who would have thought that he would have summoned the number one expert in the world with those words of his!</p><br/><p><em>I am truly too unlucky! </em>Meng FanYun almost had the urge to give himself a few tight slaps for spouting such nonsense!</p><br/><p>However, it was already too late for Meng FanYun to regret! At this moment, Ling Jian who had heard this voice made his move!</p><br/><p>Like a bolt of lightning!</p><br/><p>His target was Meng FanYun!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian raised his sword and charged forward, dashing through the crowd like a ghostly figure. A series of enraged roars sounded immediately and countless blade lights were slashed down towards Ling Jian!</p><br/><p>Countless palm strikes were sent out mercilessly towards the ghostly figure! The entire hall was thrown into chaos!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face remained calm and was completely indifferent towards the incoming attacks. In his eyes, he could only see a single person, Meng FanYun!</p><br/><p>Meng FanYun let out a loud cry and tossed out the sword in his right hand. At the same time, he sent out seventy-nine palm strikes as his figure retreated backward rapidly!</p><br/><p>Meng FanYun retreated a hundred feet with a flash and his back was already up against the wall of the hall!</p><br/><p>He could not retreat any further!</p><br/><p>Despite the entire hall being filled with the blade lights of the Above Heavens experts, such an extravagant attack and luxurious lineup did not give Meng FanYun the slightest bit of security!</p><br/><p>His eyes suddenly jerked with his eyeballs spinning around in all directions. His throat let out a few choking sounds as he tried his best to take in fresh air. However, it was useless! On his chest at the position of his heart, a little red dot could be seen with blood oozing out of it!</p><br/><p>He had already suffered from a sword strike! A strike capable of taking his life! A strike sending him to the yellow springs!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s figure was like a fish in water as he weaved through the crowd. However, he could feel a burning sensation on his legs and he had already suffered an injury. The wind from Meng FanYun\u2019s palm strikes blew fiercely before him and Meng FanYun\u2019s palm strike had arrived. Tilting his body to the side, Ling Jian nimbly avoided the palm strike and his sword stabbed out at lightning speed before it was retracted equally quickly!</p><br/><p>Under the mutual lock-on of their auras, regardless of where Meng FanYun escaped to, Ling Jian would be able to find him even with his eyes shut!</p><br/><p>After Ling Jian successfully assassinated Meng FanYun, he made use of his nimble and mystical movement techniques to avoid the desperate final attack from his opponent. However, it was a pity that he couldn\u2019t avoid them all and suffered two palm strikes to his left shoulder.</p><br/><p>He then halted his footsteps abruptly and a brilliant ball of sword light was formed with a wave of his sword. Before the experts in the hall could react, the ball of light exploded into sword rays shooting out in all directions and a series of wails could be heard!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s mystical movement techniques appeared again!</p><br/><p>The next instant, Ling Jian\u2019s figure was already back to his original position: the middle of the hall!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s clothes were tattered all over and sword cuts covered his body! With this single advance and retreat, there were more than ten people who collapsed on the floor!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Jian could not avoid the numerous blades and dozens of sword cuts covered his body! The strangest thing was the fact that apart from the wounds on his legs that were bleeding, the other wounds on the upper half of his body weren\u2019t bleeding in the slightest!</p><br/><p>In the gaps where his black robes were tattered, a glowing gold light could be seen!</p><br/><p>A trace of gratitude could be seen in Ling Jian\u2019s eyes. Protective vest! Ling Tian had made use of the flood dragon\u2019s hard skin to craft a dozen or so protective vests and Ling Jian had received one.</p><br/><p>Initially, Ling Jian insisted on rejecting the protective vest, thinking that the vest would be completely useless and would even affect his mobility and flexibility. In the end, Ling Tian flew into a rage and gave a strict order to force Ling Jian to put on the vest. Who would have thought that the vest would save his life today?</p><br/><p>\u201cProtective vest! This b*st*rd has a protective vest!\u201d A white-haired elder was angered to the point he almost vomited blood! He initially thought that the other party would have been reduced to mush under their flurry of blades but never expected him to have such a treasure!</p><br/><p>No wonder this fellow would ensure that there were no other openings to any part of his body apart from his chest and back! It turns out that he had nothing to be afraid of! However, just what kind of material was the protective vest made of?! It was actually able to receive the attacks of dozens of XianTian experts without being damaged!</p><br/><p>With just his martial arts alone, the First Pavilion Head could look down on the world proudly! Together with this protective vest\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at the numerous sword cuts all over Ling Jian\u2019s body, Xiao YouHan felt as though a large hammer hammered down on her chest. She almost blacked out and she felt her innards burning on fire!</p><br/><p><em>He is injured! He is injured </em>\u2026 her heart was filled with those words and she felt an explosion going off in her head. She could not consider anything else and she almost died from the heartache.</p><br/><p>Only until the white-haired elder let out a roar did Xiao YouHan snap out from her grief. Looking at Ling Jian standing in the middle of the hall unharmed, Xiao YouHan was overjoyed and had the urge to dive into Ling Jian\u2019s embrace and burst out crying! However, she couldn\u2019t. If she really pounced forward into his embrace, she would only become his burden and may even be the accomplice to kill him!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian remained silent and his sword stabbed out again.</p><br/><p>Only at this moment did Meng FanYun\u2019s body which was leaning against the wall slide down onto the ground. His eyes were wide open in disbelief and regret could be seen in his eyes!</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Master has passed away! Sect Master has passed away!!!\u201d A loud roar could be heard and the eyes of the experts in the hall all turned red as they pounced forward at Ling Jian!</p><br/><p>\u201cTake revenge for Sect Master!\u201d Someone cried out at the top of his lungs!</p><br/><p>\u201cAHHHH!!!\u201d Everyone charged forward as though they had gone mad.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian immediately felt the pressure increasing many times and he could no longer deal with the never-ending stream of attacks. Clanging sounds could be heard whenever his enemy\u2019s blades came into contact with his protective vest. While they weren\u2019t able to destroy his vest, the powerful force from their XianTian inner qi was enough to make Ling Jian miserable. Even if he didn\u2019t seem injured on the surface, he would definitely have some internal injuries.</p><br/><p>With the burning pain on his left shoulder, he almost could not lift up his left hand anymore. The two palm strikes from Meng FanYun weren\u2019t so easily taken! While he had his protective vest and inner qi to protect his body, the desperate strike of this peerless expert had still caused great injury!</p><br/><p>Brandishing his sword a few times, another Above Heavens expert lay on the floor dead. At the same time, Ling Jian received another blow to his left shoulder because of its stiffness.</p><br/><p>His black mask had already disappeared and Ling Jian\u2019s face was filled with calmness. Not a single emotion could be seen on his face and killing intent exploded forth from his entire body! He reaped the lives of those around him with every sword strike but also began suffering from injuries one after another.</p><br/><p>Ever since he entered the hall, Ling Jian had not looked at Xiao YouHan again! He was afraid! While Ling Jian wasn\u2019t afraid of death, he was afraid that his heart might falter if he saw that beautiful appearance and his resolution would waver!</p><br/><p>Shuah! His right leg suffered another sword strike. Ling Jian\u2019s body slanted to the right and almost collapsed on the ground as his sword stabbed out mercilessly at the one who injured him!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was already in a miserable situation!</p></div>\n</div>"}

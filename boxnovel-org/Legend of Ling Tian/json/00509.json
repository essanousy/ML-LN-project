With a vulgar expression on his face and a long strand of drool hanging from his mouth, our young noble Ling lifted his head up\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue walked over slowly, wiping her head of wet hair. In the lush greenery of the forest around them, it further amplified the glow and bearing of Xiao YanXue\u2019s skin, causing the hearts of any who looked to be mesmerized. She crept behind Ling Tian, wanting to give him a good scare, but she suddenly found out that there was something wrong with his face, and with him muttering incessantly to himself, she could not help but feel curious.</p><br/><p>Tiptoeing to his side, she only saw Ling Tian with a lecherous expression, and a long line of drool coming out from his mouth, as though he was sleeping\u2026 Xiao YanXue almost laughed out loud, Ling Tian\u2019s look totally resembled that of a starry-eyed infatuated fool\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s not right! Xiao YanXue immediately woke up with a start. How\u2026 how could he be like this? Could it be\u2026 she immediately started to have doubts and suspicions\u2026.</p><br/><p>At this point, she suddenly heard Ling Tian murmur to himself, \u201cPity, what a pity\u2026\u201d His voice was thick with regret, full of melancholy, as well as frustration.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue sidling up to him like a dream, before softly whispering, \u201cWhat pity?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lost in his fantasies, Ling Tian did not realize a thing and unconsciously replied, \u201cWhat a pity, such a white and big butt, but marred by small black birthmark\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack birthmark?\u201d Xiao YanXue repeated with her head full of fog. Her gaze slowly shifted to her own buttocks, and she suddenly blushed a deep red, before letting out a piercing scream. The sound split the silence like how a hot knife cut through butter, and she immediately burst into a rage directed at Ling Tian, \u201cAHHHHHH LING TIAN\u2026. You darned lecher, smelly pervert, disgusting rogue!\u2026\u201d Her elegant demeanor instantly transformed into that of a raging dinosaur, pouncing on Ling Tian with teeth bared. Her arms were like windmills as they pounded rapidly on Ling Tian, as though she had forgotten that he was grievously injured\u2026</p><br/><p>Lost within his beautiful daydream, with a sunny smile on his face, Ling Tian in his dream had put out both his hands, squeezing the air as though he had grabbed onto something\u2026 in an instant, his fantasy was horribly shattered, and before he could process exactly what happened, he felt a few heavy blows land on him, making him scream out in misery. He opened his eyes, blearily yelling, \u201cXiao YanXue! What are you doing?!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I doing? What am I doing???\u201d Her face flushed red like a tomato in shame and anger. With a killing gaze, Xiao YanXue replied, \u201cWhat did you say just now? What\u2026. What birthmark?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Ling Tian was stunned speechless. He knew that his secret had been exposed and that he was in big trouble. Seeing that lass pouncing on him with claws outstretched and teeth bared, he could only curl up like a ball using his hands, \u201cSpare me\u2026 please\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought you were unable to move because of your injuries? Even needing me to feed you water and food\u2026 so it turns out\u2026 it turns out\u2026 you b*st*rd! Jerk! Jerk\u2026 you lied to me, played with me, you\u2026 you\u2026 how could you treat me like this? How am I supposed to face anyone in the future? Do you still have a conscience?! Wuwu\u2026 wuwu\u2026\u201d As Xiao YanXue continued to hammer him, she felt all the more wronged, and suddenly stopped her actions, covering her face and bursting out into tears.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was at a loss as to what to do, and could only stammer repeatedly, \u201cThis\u2026. This\u2026 ehhh\u2026 ummm\u2026.\u201d He hemmed and hawed for half a day, but nothing proper could come out. For him who was most afraid of a lady crying, he was totally shocked stiff to the point his brain stopped processing\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing his expression, Xiao YanXue began to cry even harder, \u201cYou\u2026 you disgusting lecher\u2026 wuwuwu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s eyes turned as he thought of something. Immediately, he berated loudly, \u201cWhy are you crying for? What\u2019s so good about crying? Didn\u2019t I only take a look?! It\u2019s not like you lost a piece of flesh! These last few days, didn\u2019t you see everything on my body, and even touched it? Did I even shed a tear? Really!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing his roguish tone, Xiao YanXue began to tremble uncontrollably, and she gritted her teeth as she viciously spat, \u201cLing Tian! You, say that again! How could you be like this? Did you think that I was willing to look at you, touch you? If not for the fact that you\u2026 I\u2026 I really misjudged you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sniggered suddenly as he replied, \u201cSince it\u2019s something we were going to see sooner or later, what\u2019s the harm in looking right now? You\u2019ve already seen mine, so there\u2019s no harm in me doing the same, unless\u2026 you don\u2019t want to let me see? You\u2026 want to let someone else see?\u201d He winked a few times, suggestively saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and die!\u201d Xiao YanXue was filled with conflicting emotions of shame, happiness, anger\u2026 she immediately executed a flying kick, sending him flying into the river. With this sentence from Ling Tian, she knew that the person in her heart had finally accepted and acknowledged her, and could not help but feel a sense of sweetness. However, she was unwilling to get the short end of the stick, and pouted, \u201cBut you shouldn\u2019t have lied to me\u2026 saying that you couldn\u2019t move\u2026 did you know how worried I was?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, her face reddened once again. If she knew that Ling Tian could move, with her conservative character, how would she be so brazen as to strip completely naked and jump into the nearby river to take a bath? The more she thought about it, the more she thought about how her entire process of bathing must have been seen completely by that lecher, and she could not help but feel her body grow hot with shame. Suddenly, she moaned in despair, collapsing weakly on the ground. She felt as though she could not face anyone in the future\u2026</p><br/><p>Dripping wet, Ling Tian stood in the water, showing only his head as he giggled, \u201cSince someone\u2019s going to be my wife sooner or later, what does it matter if I take a look now? Hehehe, actually, it\u2019s still really white, no need to worry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue was completely angered and begun to pick up any object she could find within reach to fling into the river, Stones, rocks, mud all flew towards Ling Tian, who let out a yelp and submerged himself completely at the bottom. His movements were quick and fluid, unlike someone who had been injured and could not even move.</p><br/><p>The more she threw, the angrier Xiao YanXue got, to the point that she threw everything around her vicinity and began to look for more. She swore internally that she would only stop when that jerk\u2019s head was full of lumps.</p><br/><p>\u2018Hua la\u2019, came the splashing of water, as Ling Tian leaped out from the river and grabbed Xiao YanXue in one go. In her anger, Xiao YanXue immediately started to struggle.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian drew close to her ear, blowing inside, \u201cSilly lass, how could I, Ling Tian, be that sort of despicable lecher to not take responsibility? If I had evil designs on you, then during this period of time, how many chances would I have gotten? Hmm? I may not be a gentleman, but if it\u2019s not a lady that likes me, I will not even take a look at her. Since I\u2019ve already gazed at you, then I\u2019ll take responsibility and make you my wife, heheheh\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue snorted at this, angrily replying, \u201cWho\u2019s your wife? Don\u2019t be shameless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian blinked, asking in confusion, \u201cYou really don\u2019t want to let me look?\u201d</p><br/><p>All he received was a vicious replied, \u201cOnly ghosts would let you see their bodies!\u201d</p><br/><p>Scratching his head, he maintained the bewildered look as he slowly spoke, \u201cThen\u2026. If you don\u2019t want to let me see, who do you want to show it to then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to\u2026.\u201d Xiao YanXue started, before she realized that she had fallen into his trap once again. She could not help but beat him in anger, \u201cYou\u2019re a baddie! Pig head!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut you haven\u2019t replied me, who do you want to show it to?\u201d Ling Tian unforgivingly stuck close to her, slowly breathing onto Xiao YanXue\u2019s skin, causing it to heat up. Xiao YanXue only sensed her body heating up, after which she lost all strength and could only weakly reply, \u201cYou\u2026 let go of me\u2026 first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet you go? How could I bear to?\u201d Ling Tian leered at her, before suddenly sticking out his tongue to slowly lick her ear as he whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you can bear to let me go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue trembled and melted into his embrace. She suddenly felt as though she did not even have the strength to breathe, her pupils dilated as she moaned, \u201cHow\u2026 how could I bear to do so? Ah\u2026\u201d She let out a soft yelp as Ling Tian nipped at her earlobe with his teeth, putting it in his mouth and using his tongue to tease it. His hands began to perform a \u2018pincer attack\u2019, each slipping under her skirt and collar respectively, occupying the \u2018mountains and valleys\u2019, wantonly kneading them.</p><br/><p>Because Xiao YanXue had just finished her bath, her robes were rather loosely tied around her body, allowing Ling Tian unimpeded access to roam around and attack. Xiao YanXue only felt Ling Tian\u2019s hands playing hanky-panky all around her body, and her pure and untouched maiden body was trembling non-stop under his assault. Her face flushed red as though it was burning up, and her body lay weakly like putty on him, her eyes giving off a drunken look even as soft moans escaped her mouth.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian suddenly whispered in a low voice, \u201cLook.\u201d Mustering all the strength in her body, Xiao YanXue looked down, only to see Ling Tian\u2019s hands unknowingly having swum inside her robes, parting them as each of his hands held on to a white jade bunny firmly. From the robes that were still covering those parts, one could see it continuously changing shape as his hands kneaded them like dough\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 want to see!\u201d Xiao YanXue put up a token resistance, but it was to no avail, and she could only resort to squeezing her eyes shut to the embarrassing truth in front of her, both her hands gripping tightly on top of Ling Tian\u2019s to prevent him from moving around. However, feeling the heat being transmitted from his large hands to her jade globes, she felt as though her body was about to float away into paradise\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s mouth slowly trailed down from her ear, following the curves of her face to her slender neck. He then trailed back up, finally latching on her cherry red lips, drawing them into his mouth. Upon receiving the brunt of the attack, Xiao YanXue exclaimed in surprise but was taken advantage of by Ling Tian to stick his tongue into her mouth, lawlessly playing with her tongue\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue let out a surprised moan, suddenly feeling as though her emotions were set on fire. Ling Tian seemed to have dragged out the most primitive desires hidden inside her, and suddenly she stretched out a jade arm, tightly clasping on his neck as she squeezed her eyes shut, allowing Ling Tian to violate as he wished\u2026</p><br/><p>Their lips parted. Ling Tian gazed at the dreamy-eyed Xiao YanXue who was gasping for breath, pulling her into his embrace as he whispered in her ear, \u201cIn the future, are you going to let me see?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue was still hyperventilating, her brain in a mess. Before the sentence could register, she had already subconsciously nodded her head.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

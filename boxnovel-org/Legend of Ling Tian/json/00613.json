If you two overdo things, it will only backfire and your loses will far exceed your gains. The two of you should understand the meaning of more haste less speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen ate her porridge silently and looked at Ling Tian silently like a child who had just been reprimanded.</p><br/><p>Li Xue held onto a large bowl of porridge and drank a big mouthful of porridge. Feeling the warmth in her tummy, she rolled her eyes and said, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t know how to spout nice logic like this. Where are we going to find such a good opportunity? Besides that, you should let us absorb all of the frosty qi in this place at least right? The whole mountain is already covered in frost and if we don\u2019t get rid of the frost in the mountain, how are we going to use this place in the future? An ordinary person would not even be able to last two minutes in this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>This lass still doesn\u2019t want to give up. Ling Tian felt amused in his heart but put on a stern appearance, \u201cYour bodies are already filled with the XianTian qi of the Divine Black Negative Meridians. Even if you refine it all, it is only a ball of energy in your body and still wouldn\u2019t be your strength completely. Under such circumstances, what is the point of absorbing all of the frosty qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them fell into deep thought and Li Xue who had a deep understanding of the Divine Ice Formula seemed to have understood something.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was right. The frosty XianTian in their body was only a ball of energy but was not something which belonged to them completely. It had not merged with the inner qi of their own Divine Ice Formula yet. They needed to absorb it fully and merge it into their own bodies. While the situation before them was rare, they would still have such a chance again in the future. As long as they found an ice peak that would never melt, the environment would probably be extremely similar. If that\u2019s the case, what was the point of being reluctant today?</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the purest XianTian qi of the Divine Black Negative Meridians had already been absorbed from Yu BingYan\u2019s body into their own. For them to absorb the external frosty qi, it wouldn\u2019t be of much use to them and might even create chaos in their meridians.</p><br/><p>As for the issue about this place being unusable in future, that was completely ridiculous. Without a source, all of the frosty qi in this place would be dispersed after lighting up piles of charcoal in the room for three to five days!</p><br/><p>However\u2026 seeing such a pure frosty qi before their eyes but being unable to absorb it truly left them with reluctance.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cAfter today, it is time for the two of you to be the guards. I will be going into seclusion together with Ling Jian and the rest soon and we will need two days at the very least. At that time, with our pure Yang inner qi, even if this place doesn\u2019t turn into a volcano, it shouldn\u2019t be too far off\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeclusion? Why are you guys going into seclusion?\u201d Li Xue grabbed a piece of meat and enjoyed it with delight. The three of them had truly been starved badly over the past few days.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat for? After you punctured a few holes into the flood dragon inner pellet, it would be impossible for us to keep it for a long period of time. Besides that, the two of you cultivate the Divine Ice Formula and will not be able to absorb the pure Yang qi of the inner pellet. If not the two of you being on guard duty, who should be the one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Li Xue agreed lazily. At this moment, both Ling Chen and Li Xue realized that Ling Tian\u2019s expression seemed a little funny, as though he was sneakily looking at something on their bodies. What was there to see?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s there to see?\u201d Ling Chen looked at Ling Tian doubtfully. She then looked at Li Xue and\u2026 \u201cAHHHH!!!\u201d Ling Chen let out a loud shriek and the chopsticks in her hand fell onto the floor. She quickly covered her chest with her hands and her body shrunk up with her face completely red\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still looking?!!!! AHHH\u2026 scram scram scram!! You scoundrel! You lecher! You b*stard!!\u201d Following that, Li Xue also noticed it and stood up while sending a flurry of fists to Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>Young noble Ling Tian was currently looking at the two ladies with a lecherous smile and just when he was still in his fantasies, he received a series of attacks. He was currently at his weakest state and even if he wasn\u2019t at his weakest, would he dare to retaliate? He could only let out a miserable shriek and escape pitifully.</p><br/><p>Over the next few days, after Li Xue and Ling Chen consolidated their cultivation, they started to train Yu BingYan. Yu BingYan had a sudden surge of inner qi in her body and she was like a three-year-old child who suddenly had the strength of an adult. She did not know how to control it properly and was naturally teased by the other two ladies.</p><br/><p>Naturally, all of this was accomplished within the mountain and anyone on the outside was clueless.</p><br/><p>As for Ling Jian and the others, they were summoned by Ling Tian for training\u2026</p><br/><p>Over the next few days, the members of the Ling Family Courtyard felt as though the seasons had cycled through the year and they had experienced all four seasons. From the cooling weather at the start to the bitter cold. The temperature then increased rapidly again and after half a day of spring, it seemed to be the blazing summer\u2026</p><br/><p>The temperature was still increasing and everyone was crying out bitterly!</p><br/><p>They just changed out of their thin clothes into their fur coats and were shivering before the fireplace. However, they quickly felt the temperature going back up and they had to take off all of their fur coats and change back to their thin clothes. However, that wasn\u2019t enough and even if they stripped down to their birthday suit, it still wasn\u2019t enough!</p><br/><p>Just what was going on?!</p><br/><p>Almost everyone was filled with doubt as they grumbled.</p><br/><p>The reason why it was \u2018almost\u2019 was that there were exceptions. Like\u2026</p><br/><p>Justice stood under the tree leisurely and looked at the three ladies who were sparring with interest. He was definitely an exception.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and Li Xue took turns to spar with Yu BingYan, hoping that she would be able to swiftly increase her combat ability. What surprised Justice the most was Yu BingYan\u2019s speed of improvement. Even describing it as traveling a thousand miles in a day wasn\u2019t enough to describe her speed. Of course, he was only surprised. As a medical saint, he naturally understood that after uprooting her Divine Black Negative Meridians, unblocking her Conception and Governing Vessels, and being taught by two experts, it would be strange if her improvement was slow. Although her current rate of improvement was indeed a little absurd.</p><br/><p>If Ling Tian were to describe it with an analogy, he would say: She was still in kindergarten two days ago and she was in primary school yesterday. As for today, she is already studying for her bachelors, and maybe tomorrow she will be studying for her masters. Perhaps she would be going for her doctorate after that\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, this was her speed. In the eyes of an ordinary individual, it was definitely frightening. While both Ling Chen and Li Xue had just achieved a breakthrough in their martial arts realm and their speed of improvement could be said to be extremely swift, their speed was completely incomparable to Yu BingYan.</p><br/><p>While this was because Yu BingYan\u2019s starting point was low and she had the fortune of consuming a few precious herbs together with her Conception and Governing Vessels being unblocked, Yu BingYan herself was a huge reason as well!</p><br/><p>After so many years of struggling with her Divine Black Negative Meridians, Yu BingYan was unable to cultivate any high-level techniques. She was the only martial arts cripple in the gigantic Yu Family but had never given up on herself. She felt that even if she couldn\u2019t cultivate a high-level technique, she could still seek another path. Thus, Yu BingYan immersed herself in various books. Yu BingYan could memorize various martial arts theories and cultivation methods forward and backward. She had even taken martial arts manuals apart word by word and tried piecing them together in a different manner, hoping to find an unexpected method to treat her illness.</p><br/><p>However, she had never managed to find any solution to treat her illness. On the contrary, she had already memorized the various martial arts theories completely. She was like a living library or perhaps she was like a botany professor. However, she was a botany professor who did not have any experience with planting plants. As long as she had the chance to grasp, understand, and apply all of these theories, it would be an extremely easy matter for her to apply her knowledge. She only needed to practice at the moment.</p><br/><p>What interested Justice the most was the fact that every casual move which Yu BingYan used would be completely flawless as though it was naturally formed by the heavens and earth. Furthermore, her moves had the elegance of a noble and the slight fragrance of the books. It was as though she wasn\u2019t fighting but writing a poem or painting. All of her actions were filled with the charm of poetry and painting. What was undeniable was the fact that all of her moves were extremely powerful. When it was unleashed with Yu BingYan\u2019s powerful inner qi, it wasn\u2019t something to be underestimated.</p><br/><p>What an interesting lady!</p><br/><p>Even with Justice\u2019s knowledge, he was entranced by the scene before him. While Yu BingYan\u2019s level of martial arts wasn\u2019t worth much to him, it was a completely new and elegant martial art that greatly attracted Justice\u2019s interest. In this instant, it was as though there was a new door being opened to him!</p><br/><p>Surprise, a great surprise!</p><br/><p>Justice shut his eyes slowly and replayed all of Yu BingYan\u2019s moves again in his mind. The moves that Yu BingYan wasn\u2019t fully familiar with were automatically refined within Justice\u2019s mind. All of her moves were connected from the start to the end without looking as though it was being forcefully connected. It naturally formed a full set of complete martial arts and there were naturally a lot of moves which originated from Justice\u2019s boundless martial arts knowledge. However, the foundations of those moves were still based off Yu BingYan\u2019s original creativity.</p><br/><p>Every move of hers seemed to carry with it the natural laws of the heaven and earth!</p><br/><p>Becoming one with the world!</p><br/><p>Justice gasped in his heart. While the moves of this lass weren\u2019t fully developed yet, it already had the foundation of a martial arts grandmaster. It was only a matter of time before she became a peerless expert! Someone who no one could ignore! With her talent, her accomplishments wouldn\u2019t be below Ling Chen or Li Xue!</p></div>\n</div>"}

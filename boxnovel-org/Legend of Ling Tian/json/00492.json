Empress?!\u201d Ling Chen was astounded, \u201cHow can it be? I\u2026 I am only a maid. I\u2026 I have never thought about that\u2026 I only want to be by my young noble\u2019s side and even being young noble\u2019s concubine is a status far beyond my reach! How can I be the Empress?\u2026\u201d In agitation, Ling Chen began stuttering and completely lost her cool!</p><br/><p>Li Xue chuckled and said with mysterious wisdom, \u201cBecause of Ling Tian\u2019s profligate behavior when he was young, there aren\u2019t many ladies by his side and there are also far too few ladies capable of moving his heart. Up until now, you are the only one who truly moved his heart. As for BingYan, Shui QianRou, Xiao YanXue, Princess JiaoYue, or at the very most Wei XuanXuan; however, Wei XuanXuan is too far at the borders and she can be ignored. Of these few people, who would have the right to become the Empress?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue then let out a warm smile, \u201cThe title of Empress is not the same as the status of being the First Wife. If you are just marrying an ordinary aristocratic family disciple, your status will probably be of concern and could result in obstruction. In fact, it may even be a stain in your life in the future. However, things are completely different when it comes to being an Empress of a new empire. The Empress is the mother of the empire and this status has a huge meaning to the situation of the world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu BingYan has the background of the Yu Family, Shui QianRou has the background of the Shui Family, Xiao YanXue has the background of the Xiao Family and JiaoYue has the background of the previous Sky Bearing imperial family. Regardless of how virtuous any of them are, none of them have any hope of becoming the future Empress! Even though any one of them has the status to become Ling Tian\u2019s First Wife, none of them can become the Empress of a new empire! Thus, there are no suitable candidates other than you. Even if you aren\u2019t willing to become the Empress, you will definitely be pushed onto the throne after Ling Tian unites the continent. This is something that I am absolutely sure of! If not, why would he not hand over the Courtyard to anyone else but you? Do you still not understand his intentions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 even if BingYan and the rest aren\u2019t suitable, there is still you. How can this little sister fight with elder sister?!\u201d Ling Chen said carefully. She wasn\u2019t trying to be pretentious but she was truly apprehensive of the title and didn\u2019t think that she had the ability to be the mother of the continent.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Li Xue burst out laughing, \u201cYou are probably unaware of this. Even if you give Ling Tian a thousand guts, he would never dare to make me his Empress! Even the background of the four added together would not make Ling Tian as wary as my background! As long as Ling Tian is willing to keep me by his side, I will be satisfied!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d Ling Chen covered her mouth in shock. To think that my elder sister Li Xue has such a terrifying background! However, what kind of a background could she have? There doesn\u2019t seem to be such a power in the world! Even more frightening than the four of their backgrounds combined\u2026 my goodness! What kind of a background would that be?! Ling Chen took in a breath of cold air. However, even after running through her memory plenty of times, she could not think of any power capable of rivaling the four families added together!</p><br/><p>\u201cHaiz, no matter what, all of these are things for the future. Victory and defeat are not determined yet and it is far too early to talk about it! Let us go. It seems like the NanGong Family isn\u2019t ready yet. We have probably overestimated their strength.\u201d Li Xue ended this pointless conversation.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ling Chen recovered from her shock and immediately remembered the NanGong Family\u2019s plans. Her mind regained clarity and she said, \u201cPerhaps not. Even though we pretended to conceal ourselves when coming out, the NanGong Family must have definitely received news of us. The chess piece that young noble had planted half a year ago is finally exhibiting its use. Thus, I estimate that the NanGong Family has already begun their operation and are on our return journey route.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen said with absolute confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf NanGong Yu is truly wise, she would choose to stop this operation right now and insist on the retreat of her NanGong Family. She should hide in the deep mountains to recuperate and build up the strength of her NanGong Family. In the eyes of the ignorant, we would be seemingly letting our guard down but if one thinks through things carefully, a big loophole would immediately be spotted. Why is it such that our defensive net was previously so tight, but after the NanGong Family decided on their plan, our defenses became so loose? With such an obvious opening, how can there not be a trap hidden?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue analyzed calmly and accurately pointed out the flaw of Ling Chen\u2019s plan, \u201cIt is as though there was a pillow magically appearing when you want to sleep, and your enemy stretching his neck out for you when you want to kill him. Aren\u2019t things going too smoothly? If it was you, wouldn\u2019t you find it dubious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen pondered for a moment and could not help but be a little disappointed, \u201cThat\u2019s right, while there aren\u2019t any flaws in my plan, a plan without any flaw is the biggest flaw in itself. I was taking things for granted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue chuckled before saying, \u201cThus, I estimate that it is very likely for our plan to fail. If NanGong TianHu is the one in charge of this operation, then we will definitely succeed. However, NanGong Yu is probably rushing here right now to stop NanGong TianHu from acting rashly so it is unlikely for our plan to succeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then, we can only make another plan in future.\u201d Ling Chen smiled calmly, \u201cThere will always be chances.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, it doesn\u2019t really matter. So what if they give up their plan? Can\u2019t we find them at their doorstep?\u201d Li Xue sneered, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, NanGong TianLong was the one who attacked us first and we can use that as an excuse to take revenge. We will definitely be in the right and no family would possibly speak up for a declining NanGong Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen replied with a smile and walked out of their hiding spot. The two of them then got onto their horses and returned to the Ling Family Courtyard. For their meticulous plan to fail so easily, while the both of them seemed extremely casual on the surface, they could not help but feel a tinge of discomfort in their heart. It was as though their full powered fist strike had landed in midair. Thus, the two of them had a gloomy face and did not say anything on the way back.</p><br/><p>After making a corner, the Ling Family Courtyard\u2019s majestic buildings were in sight and they were only a couple of miles away from the Courtyard. Ling Chen then let out a sigh, \u201cIt seems that this NanGong Yu is truly intelligent. She is a worthy opponent indeed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue agreed, \u201cThat\u2019s right, we have underestimated the intelligence of our enemy and it is our biggest mistake today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish her sentence, Li Xue\u2019s mouth was already wide open in shock as an unladylike curse could be heard, \u201cF**k! What are they doing here? This is their intelligence?! Aren\u2019t they too intelligent?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s face turned red as she thought to herself, Everything is good about this elder sister Li Xue. Her graceful figure is like a deity and charming appearance like a fairy. However, why must she speak in such an uncouth manner? She then followed Li Xue\u2019s line of sight and could not help but be astounded as well. An indescribable feeling rose in her heart and in excitement, she almost copied Li Xue, \u201cF\u2026\u201d Before the word could leave her lips, Ling Chen swallowed it back with great difficulty! However, the expression on her face was an extremely odd one.</p><br/><p>Because\u2026</p><br/><p>At the foot of the mountain in front of them, a large gang of troops stealthily appeared. There were more than a hundred men and they blocked the path completely. At the same time, there were plenty of figures moving about in the shadows and their rustling footsteps could be heard. It was apparent that another group of people was sprinting to cut off their escape route\u2026</p><br/><p>The person in the lead was a burly man with a full curly beard. His shoulders were broad but his tummy was round and he glared at Ling Chen ferociously\u2026 he was NanGong TianHu!</p><br/><p>Behind NanGong TianHu were three well-built men, guarding NanGong TianHu like he was a precious treasure. They had a confident smile on their face and looked at Ling Chen with undisguised hatred. At the same time, there was another individual overflowing with enmity and killing intent; she was the intelligent person that Ling Chen had just praised: NanGong Yu!</p><br/><p>Both Li Xue and Ling Chen never imagined that the plan that they originally felt was hopeless had actually succeeded. Furthermore, it was an overwhelming success and everyone who they wanted to draw out was right in front of their eyes. This huge and sudden surprise rendered both the ladies speechless with their mouth and eyes wide open\u2026</p><br/><p>But in the eyes of the NanGong Family members, the shock of the two girls looked like extreme fear!</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ling Chen, it has been long since we last met.\u201d NanGong TianHu said with delight as though victory was already within his grasp. His tone was extremely lofty and he acted in a hypocritical manner. Seeing the look of shock on the faces of these two ladies, NanGong TianHu was ecstatic! It was impossible for them to be acting. If they were acting, then their acting skills were far too mystical!</p><br/><p>\u201cSecong Master NanGong, what are you doing? Are you trying to stop me from returning home?\u201d Ling Chen was careful not to let her excitement show on her face, in case they would feel something was wrong and escape the trap.</p><br/><p>NanGong TianHu laughed, suddenly feeling as though he was a big cat playing with two poor mice under his claws. In his eyes, Ling Chen\u2019s was only trying to put on a brave front. He gave out a lascivious smile and said, \u201cWhat do I want to do? What else do you think I will be doing? Could I be doing anything else?\u201d He then obscenely moved his hands in a suggestive manner to indicate the outline of her body while following her curves with his eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Xue Leng\u2019s fist smashed onto the door frame and almost let out a groan. Not a groan of pain but one of frustration. A boorish man like Yu ManTian wouldn\u2019t understand proper etiquette and it would be a wonder if he didn\u2019t screw things up. Perhaps, the marriage of their little princess would be turned into a complete joke because of him! My dear family head, you are wise for your whole life but foolish for a single moment. How can you hand such an important matter into the hands of Third Master Yu?! Xue Leng looked at the direction Yu ManTian left and spat out a mouth of spittle and let out a curse that he will never dare to say in front of Yu ManTian, \u201cF**k!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yu ManTian came to Ling Tian\u2019s courtyard, Ling Tian was under the rack of grapes admiring Yu BingYan painting. Under the aid of the Great Cyclic Pellet, Yu BingYan had also achieved a breakthrough in her bodily functions. Apart from a huge increase in her cultivation, her body was as good as healthy in the short run. Furthermore, she was able to fully control her inner qi as her heart desired. With Ling Tian\u2019s meticulous teachings and her good mood, her improvements were extremely swift, and she had already reached the realm of \u2018heart and mind as one, heart and intent as one\u2019 in her painting skills. The way Ling Tian saw it, as long as she could reach the realm of \u2018heart and martial arts as one\u2019, she would be able to meld her martial arts and painting together! As long as she makes a breakthrough into that realm, it would be the time when Yu BingYan was completely transformed! Then, as long as Ling Tian\u2019s Divine Shocking Dragon Formula reaches the tenth stage, he would have the confidence of uprooting Yu BingYan\u2019s ailment!</p><br/><p>Bang! Third Master Yu did not display any courtesy as he pushed opened the door of Ling Tian\u2019s courtyard and slammed the doors shut. The three people in the courtyard were immediately startled, and Ling Tian said while shaking his head, \u201cThird Master, ever since your arrival, I have already changed the doors to my courtyard three times. It seems that I will have to change them into metal doors soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat bullsh*t door? This daddy here has pressing matters! A happy occasion! Who cares about your door?!\u201d Third Master Yu began shouting with spittle flying all over, \u201cYou brat, you are going to become a groom!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian\u2019s shocking words thundered in Ling Tian\u2019s head and both Ling Chen and Yu BingYan both turned their heads around and looked at Yu ManTian in shock. Ah? My beloved one is about to be married? Why don\u2019t I know about that?! Who is the bride?! Ling Chen was still able to remain calm but definitely not Yu BingYan. She knew that while her third uncle usually tended to shoot his mouth, she knew that he would never tell lies. With her hands trembling, a large blotch of black ink was smeared over her painting.</p><br/><p>Satisfied with the commotion he caused, Yu ManTian said with a wide smile, \u201cLittle brat, your fortune has arrived! My big brother has given the order to let this Third Master propose a marriage to your Ling Family, to let this lass BingYan become your wife. Come and pay your respect to your third father-in-law! Have you turned foolish from joy?\u201d Yu ManTian said with his chest stuck out and hands on his hip, looking as though he was really the \u2018third father-in-law\u2019.</p><br/><p>Third father-in-law?! Was there such a title?</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d A black line was seen on Ling Tian\u2019s face! It was the first time in his life where he was completely speechless!</p><br/><p>After a moment of loss, Ling Chen suddenly covered her mouth and laughed to the point she was swaying from side to side.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2026 third uncle!\u201d Yu BingYan who was stunned silly began stomping her feet as tears began to fill the corner of her eyes!</p><br/><p>She had never seen someone so idiotic! Yu BingYan was both angered and embarrassed in her heart. Such a joyful affair was turned into a complete joke by her dear third uncle! She had never seen anyone who proposed a marriage to the groom instead of the groom\u2019s parents! Wasn\u2019t he trying to embarrass himself? According to the etiquette of the current generation, as long as the Ling Family was dissatisfied, her marriage would become an impossibility!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, even if he wanted to find the groom himself, he still shouldn\u2019t do it in front of the bride herself! I\u2026 I am also a party involved in this matter!!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Yu ManTian scratched his head in ignorance and was completely puzzled by the reaction of the three people in front of him. He suddenly thought he understood what was going on and flew into a rage, \u201cYou darn brat aren\u2019t willing? You are actually unwilling to marry BingYan?!\u201d The more he thought about it, the more he felt his guess was correct and he sent out a palm strike. \u201cD*mmit! You dare to be unwilling?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird uncle!\u201d Yu BingYan stomped her feet and stood in between both of them. Her face turned completely red as tears filled her eyes, \u201cYou, you, you will really anger me to death\u2026. Wuwuwu\u2026\u201d Yu BingYan then covered her face and burst out crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Master, Third Master\u2026\u201d Xue Leng rushed over in frustration, \u201cThird Master, you shouldn\u2019t be finding young noble Ling to discuss such a matter! You should be proposing the marriage to Duke Ling or Old Madam Ling. Why aren\u2019t you following the rules?!\u201d Xue Leng stomped his feet in frustration. He had arrived a step too late and a fight had almost broken out! Who would propose a marriage in such a way? Can this be considered proposing a marriage?! This was no different from forcing a marriage! If this matter were to spread out, the Yu Family would definitely lose a great deal of face!</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026\u201d Yu ManTian awkwardly retracted his palm strike and began to ruffle his messy hair. He then suddenly burst out into an outrage, \u201cDarn b*st*rd! Why didn\u2019t you tell me earlier? You caused this Third Master to lose face! Are you happy now?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Leng was completely speechless as he thought to himself, You disappeared in a flash and I didn\u2019t even have the time to finish reading out the Family Head\u2019s message. How would I have the time to tell you about that?</p><br/><p>\u201cLead the way, this Third Master will go and find Duke Ling\u2026 to err, promote kinship between us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian almost fainted! You are going to promote kinship with my grandfather?!</p><br/><p>Seeing Yu ManTian leaving while cursing Xue Leng along the way, Ling Chen\u2019s eyes bent into two crescent moons, \u201cCongratulations young noble! Miss BingYan is tender and wise, and furthermore fully devoted to you. She is definitely a good match for young noble and the pair of lovers have finally come together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a \u2018hmph\u2019 and said, \u201cChen\u2019er, do you really think that way? Don\u2019t you have any other thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen let out a gentle smile and said tenderly, \u201cWhat is young noble talking about? While this matter definitely isn\u2019t as simple as it seems on the surface, young noble and sister BingYan being in love is a truth. No matter what the agenda of the Yu Family, young noble and sister BingYan can finally have a happy ending.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a chuckle and suddenly grabbed Ling Chen into his embrace, \u201cChen\u2019er, what\u2026 what is your opinion? Do you really not have any thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe?\u201d Ling Chen was stunned for a moment, \u201cWhat do young noble mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t jealous at all?\u201d Ling Tian asked, \u201cIf you are not jealous at all, this young noble is going to be angry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s eyes sparkled as she replied, \u201cYoung noble is the most beloved person to me and your happiness is mine as well. Why will\u2026 Chen\u2019er is still a lady after all and I will definitely be a little bit jealous\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ah ah, you acting like this makes me happier!\u201d Ling Tian laughed and rubbed Ling Chen\u2019s head dotingly. He then changed the topic, \u201cI wonder what Yu ManLou\u2019s intentions are? Why do I feel as though there are many dangers hidden within and this proposal of his reeks like a scheme?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, there must definitely be something fishy going on,\u201d Ling Chen nodded her head as she said with thought, \u201cThere isn\u2019t any news from the north yet and we cannot make an appropriate decision. We can only play it by ear at the moment. At the very least, this marriage proposal is a good thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, this is definitely a win-win situation. However, with the status of the Yu Family, why would they lower their status and take the initiative to propose the marriage? Furthermore, why would they place a boorish man like Yu ManTian in charge of such an important thing? Furthermore, even if Yan\u2019er\u2019s father, Yu ManTang, doesn\u2019t make a personal appearance, they should still send an elder of the Yu Family down to discuss the details!\u201d Ling Tian said with a frown as he paced around, \u201cBut from Yu ManTian\u2019s reaction, this matter is definitely true. Yan\u2019er is only sixteen right? Why would Yu ManLou make such a decision?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid something happen in the Yu Family?\u201d An inspiration flashed in Ling Chen\u2019s head, \u201cDoes the Yu Family need the aid of young noble? But they cannot ask for aid openly and so they proposed a marriage. They want to seek aid from young noble under the guise of a marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnlikely,\u201d Ling Tian shook his head, \u201cwhile there are some possibilities to this, they shouldn\u2019t be so anxious if that was the case! There isn\u2019t a need to rush about it and they can definitely plan the matter slowly. Just what did I miss out? This matter isn\u2019t simple!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling\u2019s response was very simple. \u201cI have to ask Tian\u2019er first. As long as he doesn\u2019t object to it, we can accept the proposal.\u201d Old Madam Ling could naturally tell that Yu BingYan was already deeply in love with Ling Tian and Ling Tian also had her in his heart! The way Old Madam Ling saw it, even if there was something fishy about this matter, they should still accept this proposal!</p><br/><p>As for Ling Xiao and Chu Ting\u2019er, they naturally didn\u2019t have any objections! Chu Ting\u2019er was originally frustrated over her son\u2019s marriage. Knowing that even the number one family of the continent was here with a marriage proposal and even seemed like they wanted the marriage to happen as soon as possible, Chu Ting\u2019er felt extremely good in her heart. She couldn\u2019t wait to go out and publicize the matter. Mmm, who was it who said that my son was a silkpants? Not even letting me see your daughters as though guarding against a thief? Hmph, hmph, can you even be compared to the Yu Family?</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er felt extremely proud of herself right now.</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling originally wanted to send a maid to fetch Ling Tian over so they could discuss this matter as a family. After all, Yu ManTian was here to propose a marriage and he belonged to the Yu Family. However, when she said that she had to seek the opinion of Ling Tian, she never imagined that Yu ManTian would shout out, \u201cI will go and ask him!\u201d Slapping himself on the chest, \u201cRest assured Old Madam, you can leave this matter to me! Will that Ling brat dare to say no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian\u2019s words stunned Old Madam Ling silly! Once the marriage was decided, this Third Master Yu would become their in-law. Furthermore, he was still Ling Tian\u2019s senior! Was he really going to become the matchmaker with his status?</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t matter if you want to become the matchmaker for your own niece! But you actually want to be the matchmaker for both parties?! Especially when she heard Yu ManTian say, \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t agree, I will beat him up!\u201d These words had made both Old Madam Ling and Duke Ling raise their hands in surrender.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

All of a sudden, he felt extremely moved and a sense of affection overwhelmed him. He could not help but take a step forward and pull Ling Chen into his embrace. Before Ling Chen had a chance to say anything, she already felt Ling Tian lowering his head and kissing her on the lips!</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s body went frozen as her heart grew flustered. Following which, a sense of warmth and sweetness filled her heart. She knew that Ling Tian could not restrain himself in excitement and also felt the joy in Ling Tian\u2019s heart! She could not help but relax her body as her slender arms wrapped around Ling Tian\u2019s waist, hugging this man who she was deeply in love with. Let me share his happiness at this moment\u2026</p><br/><p>With a creaking sound, the window opened quietly again as Ling Jian\u2019s neck stretched into the room. The moment he saw such a scene, he quickly retracted his head and said flusteredly, \u201cI didn\u2019t see anything, I didn\u2019t see anything at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen was completely embarrassed as she pushed Ling Tian to the side. She panted softly as her face turned red, almost wanting to dig a hole to bury herself. Her eyes were filled with embarrassment and frustration but also joy and other mixed emotions, all at the same time.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian never imagined Ling Jian to come back at such a critical moment. He could not help but shake his head with a bitter laughter, \u201cLing Jian, you had ruined my joy, come in and accept your punishment. Look at how you are like now, head in the house but body outside. Isn\u2019t this bothering about your head but not your bum? Chen\u2019er, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen managed to barely suppress her feeling of embarrassment as she looked towards the window. She then could not help but burst out into giggles. But after a while, she felt that she should not have been laughing and so she stomped her foot angrily. She then turned around and ran away with her face all red\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Jian then entered the room and laughed, \u201cYoung noble, this is the first time I saw Chen\u2019er act like a little girl. Young noble\u2019s means are really powerful.\u201d Ling Jian grew up with Chen\u2019er since they were young. While they were not blood siblings, they were much closer than ordinary siblings. He had long known about how Ling Chen felt about Ling Tian. Seeing that Ling Chen\u2019s wish finally came true today and had someone to rely on in the future, together with the fact that the person was his most respected young noble, Ling Jian naturally felt happy for Ling Chen in his heart!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then grunted, \u201cWhile she looks cute now, when she calms down tomorrow, you will find that she is a hundred times cuter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian then snapped into realization as he pleaded, \u201cYoung noble, the sun is about to rise. I think that I should make my way back quickly. If Chen\u2019er that lass is going to see me in the morning, I will be in trouble. Young noble save me!\u201d This cold blooded killer would only display such a human-like side when he was beside Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then chuckled, \u201cThat\u2019s your problem. Besides, if you don\u2019t let her vent her anger, she will vent it on me, Ah Jian, for your young noble, just sacrifice yourself for once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian then groaned in agony as he escaped hastily\u2026</p><br/><p>Northern Wei, imperial palace.</p><br/><p>The crown prince, Wei ChengPing, turned around, \u201cWhat did you say? The little princess of the Yu family is in the Sky Bearing Empire? Is this news accurate?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Crown prince your highness! This is a piece of news which I only managed to get after great effort. The little princess of the Yu family, Yu BingYan, is indeed in the Sky Bearing Empire!\u201d A middle aged guard bowed in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ah ah, Yu BingYan, Sky Bearing\u2026 Hehe\u2026 Not bad, not bad. But what is she doing in the Sky Bearing Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that she is in the Ling family now and is extremely close to the young noble, Ling Tian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian?! General Ling Xiao\u2019s silkpants son?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! He is the one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that silkpants is infamous all across the world for being extremely mischievous and incorrigible. He is nothing to be feared. He probably has nothing more than a suave face and isn\u2019t worth much. If I am really going to be calculative with him, that would be thinking too highly of him.\u201d Wei ChengPing smiled, \u201cPlease invite Mister Meng over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, crown prince your highness.\u201d The guard responded.</p><br/><p>Mister Meng, or Meng LiGe, was Wei ChengPing\u2019s number one strategist. He was extremely shrewd, careful and full of ideas. He was Wei ChengPing\u2019s capable assistant and most trusted aide!</p><br/><p>A while later, Meng LiGe rushed over hastily. He was wearing a long scholarly robe with his black beard swaying gently in the wind. But, he was only a 40 plus year old middle aged scholar. He then cupped his fists in respect, \u201cI wonder what urgent matters the crown prince has?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ah, Mister Meng need not be so polite. I indeed require Mister\u2019s abilities for a matter today, to help me think of a plan for the Sky Bearing Empire.\u201d Wei ChengPing knew that this scholar in front of him was extremely wise and was a top notch character in the world today. If he does not make his request in person, Mister Meng may not accede to his request. Thus, he did not dare to be the slightest bit rude.</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe then sat down calmly as he looked towards Wei ChengPing with a smile, waving his feather fan calmly like a well refined poet. If Ling Tian saw his current appearance, he would definitely exclaim, \u201cSir, are you the godly Mister Zhuge? If not, why would you have a feather fan?!\u201d [1]</p><br/><p>Wei ChengPing then smiled, \u201cI just received news that the little princess of the Yu family is touring the Sky Bearing Empire, having a close relationship with the silkpants Ling Tian. Mister Meng is extremely clear about how I feel towards the little princess, Yu BingYan. Thus, I have found Mister to discuss a plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe laughed, \u201cI see,\u201d he then frowned, \u201cwhen the crown prince made a marriage proposal the last time, you were rejected by the Yu family already, right? The little princess of the Yu family is not the only beauty in our Northern Wei. The crown prince has a status high above everyone else in the Northern Wei, who would you not be able to marry? Why do you have to be so stubborn about the little princess of the Yu family? After all, the little princess is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe looked towards Wei ChengPing with a smile which did not seem like a smile. He naturally knew the real reason for Wei ChengPing to pester Yu BingYan. It was just that he had to hint to Wei ChengPing subtly \u2014 since you want me to help you, it is best that you are honest with me. There are some things which others will be able to tell even if you do not say. If that\u2019s the case, things would lose its meaning.</p><br/><p>Wei ChengPing\u2019s face turned slightly red, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Mister\u2019s wisdom far outshines others and is extremely knowledgeable. How can my thoughts be hidden from Mister\u2019s sharp eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>After pausing for a short while, Wei ChengPing sighed, \u201cThe world today is about to be embroiled in chaos soon. As one of the seven empires on the Heavenly Star Continent, we will definitely be dragged into this wave of chaos. At that time, it will be unknown as to who will emerge the victor. From the way every power has their own strengths currently, no one will be able to proclaim themselves the victor for sure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe then straightened his back and asked, \u201cSo, the crown prince wants to pull the Yu family over?\u201d</p><br/><p>[1]: Mister Zhuge is a famous character, Zhuge Liang, from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

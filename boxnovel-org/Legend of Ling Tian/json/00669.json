Everyone\u2019s spring is coming! Take a look, aren\u2019t the willow trees all about to bud?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian retreated in complete defeat. For the first time in his life, he truly felt helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoss Ling Jian, I am talking about you. YOUR spring is here. You obviously fell in love at first sight! You fool!\u201d Ling Tian could not help but pull Ling Jian\u2019s ears, \u201cYou want her to be your wife! You\u2026 haiz, I don\u2019t know what to say about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho wants to be his wife?\u201d As the voice sounded, Gu XiYan walked over with a smile on her face and a look of curiosity.</p><br/><p>The moment these words were said, everyone in the room burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>Gu XiYan looked around at the young teens and her face suddenly flushed red. Could it be that they are talking about me?</p><br/><p>Ling Jian fell into a daze as he muttered, \u201c\u2026wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu XiYan squealed and escaped as she scolded with embarrassment, \u201cSir Ling Jian should respect yourself. Who is your wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone burst out laughing again.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>In the Ling Family\u2019s guest hall.</p><br/><p>The piping glasses of hot tea were placed on the table with three people seated with solemn expressions. They were Old Master Ling, Old Madam Ling, and Xiao FengYang.</p><br/><p>A long while later, Old Master Ling said with a heavy voice, \u201cThis is a big matter and we have to inform Tian\u2019er immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang said with worry on his face, \u201cCurrently, Above Heavens is watching us carefully and the moment news gets leaked out, we will be facing destruction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling nodded her head in agreement, \u201cThis matter is truly grave and we do not have a way to solve this matter. However, Tian\u2019er has a stomach full of naughty ideas and this may not be a big problem for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang nodded his head with depression and said, \u201cSister-in-law, what do you think about Xue\u2019er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling frowned and said, \u201cThis matter is a no-go! Even if we want to forcefully interfere, Tian\u2019er may not agree and things may take a turn for the worst instead.\u201d She then shook her head and let out a sigh, \u201cSince you knew that things might turn out in such a manner, why did you perform those acts in the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang let out a sigh and did not say anything else.</p><br/><p>Old Master Ling asked doubtfully, \u201cSince the Xiao Family is already in such a state, why are you only talking about this now? Wouldn\u2019t things be much simpler if you had said so earlier and both of our families joined hands together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang coughed awkwardly and his old face turned red. He wasn\u2019t willing to say that he was blinded by the allure of authority. After all, who wouldn\u2019t be willing to be the ruler of the entire world? Even if they were only a puppet on the throne, the throne would still belong to their Xiao Family! If not for the strength of Above Heavens being heavily affected and the Xiao Family\u2019s army dwindling, how would they be willing to seek aid from the Ling Family?</p><br/><p>While they were all extremely clear about this in their hearts, not a single one of them would say it.</p><br/><p>In the courtyard where the Xiao Family envoys were staying.</p><br/><p>The grey-faced elder said with a solemn expression, \u201cWhere is Second Master Xiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Master just went out.\u201d A Xiao Family teen replied, \u201cBefore he left, he said that he was going to make a trip to the Ling Family. The two families have close ties after all and Family Head is sworn brothers with Old Master Ling. It would be rude of him to not visit if he is in Sky Bearing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand all of this and I do not have the energy to listen to all of your explanations.\u201d The grey-robed elder waved his hands with impatience before patting his chest and coughing. His internal injury was still extremely severe. The reply of this teen diminished half of his doubt. If Xiao FengYang left sneakily without anyone knowing, he would suspect that Xiao FengYang was up to no good and may harm his Above Heavens. But since Xiao FengYang went to the Ling Family openly, he did not have anything else to say.</p><br/><p>Waving his hands, he instructed, \u201cYouHan, inform me when Second Master is back.\u201d He then gave an eye signal to the others. The others immediately understood what he meant and followed him into the room.</p><br/><p>Xiao YouHan nodded her head with a slight frown but her cold appearance remained emotionless. It was as though she was completely indifferent towards her companion\u2019s distrust.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefore coming to Sky Bearing, I knew that this mission would definitely be a challenging one. However, I never imagined it to be so challenging. This old man no longer understands what the sect master is thinking about,\u201d the grey-robed elder said with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does Second Martial Uncle mean?\u201d a skinny middle-aged man asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sect sent a total of seven individuals out this time. But apart from this old man, the martial arts of you five are only passable. However, in a battle against experts, the aid that the five of you can provide is negligible. This is the number one puzzle. Furthermore, it is even more absurd to send Xiao YouHan to monitor Xiao FengHan!\u201d The grey-robed elder said with worry, \u201cWhile Xiao YouHan is a member of our sect, she is still a member of the Xiao Family after all. Regardless of how the sect brainwashes her, it is difficult to change this fact. If our sect ends up in a war against the Xiao Family, regardless of how loyal Xiao YouHan is to our family, it would be impossible for her to stand on our side. This is the second puzzle.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird, what use would it do to send out such a weak force? However, the sect master still chose to assign us such an important mission. This is truly baffling!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026\u201d The grey-robed elder suddenly stood up with his hands trembling and blood seeping down from the corner of his lips again. He was thoroughly frightened by a sudden thought of his, \u201cXiao FengYang is our decoy and Xiao YouHan is Xiao FengYang\u2019s decoy. Could it be that we are a decoy as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other five looked at each other with their expressions ugly.</p><br/><p>The north gate of Sky Bearing.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian rode on a large horse and his large body like a bear seemed to be crushing the horse underneath him, making it difficult for the horse to even take a step. Behind him was a long trail of carriages.</p><br/><p>Three white-robed elders were riding on top of horses as though they were Buddhist monks. Beside those three elders were seven black-robed individuals. They had chilly expressions on their faces with their appearance withered as though they were dead. Even though they were only riding the horses, they looked like formless and shapeless spirits in the eyes of others and were extremely eerie.</p><br/><p>Above the city walls, Ling Chi stood up straight as he watched the Yu Family envoy party and muttered to himself, \u201cCould this be the mysterious force of the Yu Family, the three souls and seven bodies? Why do I feel that something is extremely wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Waving his hand, Ling Feng and Ling Yun rushed over in response. Ling Chi pointed at the Yu Family envoy and instructed, \u201cArrange for some manpower to keep a close watch on these ten individuals. Not a single person can be left out.\u201d The two of them disappeared into the city walls the moment they received their orders.</p><br/><p>Ling Chi took another two steps forward and was still feeling uneasy. Calling Ling Lei over, he instructed, \u201cFind a few bandit kings who are here to test these three old men and those seven black-robed individuals. If necessary, they can start a fight to understand the strength of the other party. Let Feng and Yun take note if there are any other experts other than Third Master Yu and these ten individuals. If there are other hidden experts, report it to young noble at the very first notice.\u201d</p><br/><p>If the Yu Family was only using the three souls and seven bodies to hide something, then the hidden individual would not be someone that Ling Feng or Ling Yun would be able to deal with!</p><br/><p>Ling Lei left with his orders.</p><br/><p>Outside the city gates, another large troop arrived. Ling Chi\u2019s eyes lit up and he quickly descended from the city gates. Blocking the way, he ordered coldly, \u201cStop! Check!\u201d</p><br/><p>The three individuals at the front were Ling One, Ling Two and Ling Four. Ling Nineteen and the others were hidden among the troops. Hearing Ling Chi\u2019s voice, they immediately stopped their horses.</p><br/><p>Ling Chi\u2019s face remained cold as he checked the troops carefully. While he was performing his checks, he discreetly handed over a strip of paper into Ling One\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Ling One received the strip over without a change in his expression. He then said with feigned impatience, \u201cThis daddy has not been checked a single time after passing through so many cities. How outrageous! We are guests here to offer our blessings after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chi did not respond and continued his checks. After finishing his checks, he retreated to the side and said, \u201cSince there aren\u2019t any prohibited items, we will naturally let all of you in. Please!\u201d He then moved aside to make way.</p><br/><p>Ling One snorted coldly and entered the city.</p><br/><p>The Yu Family\u2019s imperial palace.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou held onto a piece of paper in his hands with a cunning smile on his face. As long as Above Heavens sends out all of their forces and joins hands together with my Yu Family, we will definitely be able to create a huge mess at the Ling Family\u2019s ceremony. While it will be insufficient to damage the Ling Family, it is enough to make the Ling Family\u2019s ceremony become a huge joke!</p><br/><p>For Meng FanYun to suggest working with me, he has obviously given up on the Xiao Family. If I can make use of this opportunity to recruit Above Heavens under me\u2026 even if I won\u2019t be able to prevent the Ling Family from setting up their empire, it would be worth it.</p><br/><p>I believe that Ling Tian will probably be extremely anxious this time, right?</p><br/><p>In Sky Bearing City, the dragons were mixed together with the fishes and there were still many more entering the city.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian gave strict orders for all of his information organizations to start a full-scale operation! They must not allow any oddities to happen during the ceremony! He also proclaimed that the responsibility for any oddity would fall upon every individual in the intelligence organizations!</p><br/><p>The four intelligence organizations together with the Violent Wind Gang sprang into action. Ling Jian coldly added another bit of instruction. Any stranger from outside of Sky Bearing needs to have at least three spies following them! Furthermore, all of their identities must be dug up and it would be best if they can check up to eight generations!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Ling Jian ordered, \u201cLet the little brats also get moving!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the city, the relaxed atmosphere gradually became more and more tense!</p><br/><p>Within three days, without alerting anyone, the Ling Family Courtyard had caught hundreds of captives. In the Courtyard, Feng Mo led a few hundred malevolent looking Blood Iron Warriors to interrogate the captives.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s present concern was naturally the Yu and Xiao Families. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say the Yu Family and Above Heavens.</p><br/><p>Among the people caught, there were fugitives, thieves, bandits\u2026 but not a single person from the Yu Family or those from the south-east.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian ordered calmly, \u201cInvestigate again!\u201d</p><br/><p>A while later, \u201cInvestigate carefully!\u201d</p><br/><p>After taking two steps, he looked at Ling Jian and ordered, \u201cInvestigate thoroughly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was visibly moved and hurriedly issued the order.</p><br/><p>In the past few years, Ling Tian had never used the words \u2018investigate thoroughly\u2019 and finally used these words today! These words had a completely different meaning!</p><br/><p>Even when he ordered the investigation of the person who harmed Consort Ling, Ling Tian had never used the words \u2018investigate thoroughly\u2019. Even when he was dealing with the Yu Family previously or Justice, Ling Tian had never said these two words!</p><br/><p>Investigate thoroughly! To Ling Tian\u2019s intelligence organizations, these two words were akin to an army\u2019s alert red! These two words signified that the enemy was close and they were about to engage in a brutal head to head slaughter.</p><br/><p>In the upcoming ceremony, Ling Tian was about to officially imprint his name into the history of this foreign world, the Divine Prefecture Empire! From today onward, the entire world would be ruled by the descendants of the yellow people!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian wanted to overwhelm all of his guests with the majesty of the ceremony! Since he was about to set up an empire, he wanted to rule over the entire world!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian would never allow anyone to create trouble at such an event!</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether it was a powerful organization or peerless expert!</p><br/><p>Not a single person or organization will be an exception!</p><br/><p>Those that attempted to create chaos shall be destroyed!</p><br/><p>When this order was given, even Ling Jian who killed to the point he turned numb felt nervous!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yu ManTian and the Yu Family envoy encountered trouble.</p><br/><p>To Yu ManTian, coming to Sky Bearing City was the most enjoyable place to be in. He would naturally have to find Ling Tian, Ling Jian, and the other five little ones to have a good fight. Of course, the most important thing for him to do would be to drink Ling Tian\u2019s fine wine. Apart from Sky Bearing City, he would not be able to find such enjoyment anywhere else!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian, Ling Jian, and the five little ones were extremely busy recently and Third Master Yu was naturally an understanding individual. He would definitely not visit at this moment just to be neglected by the other party. Even if they didn\u2019t say it out in the open, they definitely wouldn\u2019t be too glad. There would always be another time for him to visit Ling Tian and the others. Since it wasn\u2019t convenient for him to visit the Ling Residence, Third Master Yu naturally thought about the other place which gave him an extremely deep impression, the Smoky Thea Tower.</p><br/><p>Third Master Yu could still clearly remember composing a poem in front of all the scholars in the world and creating a commotion. Ever since that day, he no longer had the inspiration and could naturally not compose any other poems. Without the appropriate stimulus, it was impossible for him to compose another poem. This time, Third Master Yu was naturally going with the intention of seeking a stimulus to compose another poem.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis daddy has a sword in my hands\u2026\u201d He recited the very first poem which he created and brought the Yu Family envoy into the Smoky Thea Tower.</p><br/><p>After asking, he found out that someone had already reserved a room for him before his arrival. Furthermore, it was the same room which he stayed at the previous time. Even the accommodations of his followers were all prepared nicely. Yu ManTian was overjoyed. He knew that this must definitely be Ling Tian\u2019s arrangements as only Ling Tian would be so meticulous!</p><br/><p>He also did not bother about why Ling Tian was so sure beforehand that he would definitely be the one visiting! He also did not bother about how Ling Tian got the numbers right without missing a single one of his followers. What Third Master Yu cared about was Ling Tian\u2019s effort and thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a good look! This Third Master isn\u2019t only a third master at home. I am also well taken care of when I am out! Even before this Third Master\u2019s arrival, everything had already been prepared. When you little brats can attain my level, it would be a life worth living!\u201d Yu ManTian walked out of the room with his followers and demanded alcohol and food.</p><br/><p>Just as he was eating, a commotion could be heard from the outside. Ten or more people then walked into the hall and filled up two tables. They all had the aura of bandits and were probably a bunch of head bandits. While they weren\u2019t too old, their aura was imposing.</p><br/><p>A white-robed teen then walked forward the Yu ManTian\u2019s table, \u201cHow have you been, Third Master? An old friend is looking for you.\u201d This white-robed teen was Ling Feng.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian\u2019s eyes lit up and he stood up, \u201cOld friend? What bullsh*t old friend? You are this Third Master\u2019s old friend! Eat slowly little brats, this daddy is going out for a moment.\u201d He then left without waiting for a reply.</p><br/><p>Behind him, the ten individuals looked at each other and could not be bothered by Yu ManTian\u2019s actions. While this Third Master was nominally the leader of the group, he was no different from a figurehead. The secret plans that they had would be accomplished by the others and Third Master Yu did not have the slightest inkling of those plans. If not, why would they send someone who had extremely close ties with Ling Tian to lead the envoy?</p><br/><p>Everyone knew that if Yu ManTian found out about their plans, it would be great if Yu ManTian did not hand them over to Ling Tian. Furthermore, even if Yu ManTian could keep from spilling the beans, Ling Tian would probably be able to easily tell from Yu ManTian\u2019s expression. The only way to keep the secret would be to keep everything hidden from him right from the very start.</p><br/><p>The wine and dishes were served and without Third Master Yu around, the ten \u2018followers\u2019 ate merrily.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Yu Family? What Yu Family?\u201d A loud voice sounded. Even in this noisy hall, this voice could still be heard clearly. The ten individuals of the Yu Family immediately turned around to take a look at the person who was talking. One of the youths in the bandit gang continued excitedly, \u201c\u2026hahaha, what thousand-year-old family. They are no more than dog sh*t! Do you understand? Half a year ago, this daddy here entered Bright Jade City openly and did a few \u2018business transactions\u2019 there before leaving easily. Even if it was the main camp of the Yu Family, this daddy here was still able to come and go as I wished! Calling them dog sh*t is already flattering them! I think that they are less than dog sh*t!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at his appearance, it was obvious that these business transactions required no capital at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d One of the black-robed men was about to stand up but the bearded elder in the lead shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to brag with just your little abilities?! Coming and going from Bright Jade City is a big accomplishment? You are truly a frog in a well!\u201d The other bandit stood up without any signs of weakness and began describing vividly, \u201cJust seven days ago, this daddy couldn\u2019t see eye to eye with those Yu Family brats and in a single night, I stole the grain that was supposed to be for their 200,000 man army! I sold it all at a copper coin for thirty kilograms and made a fortune out of it. I heard that the Yu Family issued a bounty for me but this daddy does not give a damn about that bounty! It would be a great big joke if those cowardly scum would be able to catch this daddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>As these words were said, flattery could be heard from all around.</p><br/><p>The faces of the ten individuals at the Yu Family\u2019s table changed completely.</p></div>\n</div>"}

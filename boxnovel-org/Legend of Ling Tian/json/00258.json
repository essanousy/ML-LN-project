Number one poet! Unprecedented talent! Young noble Ling Tian! The cheers from the almost one thousand of them flooded the Smoky Thea Tower like a tsunami!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was shocked and he quickly stepped out and gave a bow to Rong ZhiYu, \u201cMister, you think too highly of Ling Tian. With my young age, how can I be worthy of such a title? I implore Mister to reconsider your decision. Ling Tian is really undeserving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rong ZhiYu chuckled, \u201cAge isn\u2019t important in the scholarly circle and the wiser individual is the senior. Young noble Ling doesn\u2019t have to be so humble. Young noble\u2019s talent is far beyond your peers with a stunning flair for poetry. Everyone present today can be the witness to that! You definitely deserve the title of number one poet! All of the scholars present are cheering from their hearts to display their sincerity and there wouldn\u2019t be a reason for young noble to reject the title.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but let out a bitter laugh. He never imagined that he would end up with the title of number one poet from his display today! At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but exclaim in his heart, Li Bai is Li Bai indeed! A random poem which I picked out had actually created such an intense reaction. If I were to recite all of Li Bai\u2019s poem, wouldn\u2019t I become a poetic sage? 1</p><br/><p>The moment Ling Tian presented his poem, no one else dared to come forward to disgrace themselves! As such, the first day of the scholarly meet had come to an end. While it was an abrupt end, everyone was extremely energized and excited from the first day alone as they all felt that this was a worthwhile trip. None of them would have imagined that the supposed number one scholar, XiMen Qing, would have been defeated so thoroughly today. Furthermore, Ling Tian had displayed his talent and greatly shocked everyone in the audience! All of the scholars then decided that they must definitely come early the next morning to enjoy the interesting meeting which awaited them.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Jian and the five other assassins were completely bored from this meeting and told Ling Tian that they wouldn\u2019t come again after today. As it was also Ling Tian\u2019s intention, he immediately agreed to it.</p><br/><p>Seeing everyone bidding their farewell and leaving the Smoky Thea Tower, Ling Tian held a small banquet in the Heavenly Fragrance Chamber with Mister Qin and Meng LiGe. Afraid that her service would be lacking, Gu XiYan served all of her best dishes and wine.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had become world famous today and was right in the limelight. Naturally, the person who was the happiest was Mister Qin. Mister Qin\u2019s eyes were already a thin line from the wide grin on his face and he seemed as though he was floating on cloud nine. Even if he were to die right here and now, he would surely have no regrets in his life.</p><br/><p>As Mister Qin and Meng LiGe entered the chamber, they realized that only Ling Tian and Yu BingYan were present while Ling Chen, the country-toppling beauty, was missing from the table. Both of them were secretly depressed in their hearts as they wondered where Ling Chen went. But being seniors, how could they possibly ask about the female companion of their disciple? Thus, they could only hide the disappointment in their hearts.</p><br/><p>After a few rounds of wine and dishes, everyone began to warm up to each other. What startled Ling Tian the most was the fact that Meng LiGe was knowledgeable in all aspects, be it geography, astrology, religions and etc. Furthermore, he had his own unique take on many different things which immediately stirred Ling Tian\u2019s interest. Thus, Ling Tian purposefully asked him some obscure questions and Meng LiGe was actually able to answer them rather accurately. While the bulk of the answer was just a deduction, Ling Tian was still amazed by Meng LiGe\u2019s knowledge and immediately had a different impression of him.</p><br/><p>No wonder the world said that he was a wise man. It was true indeed! Just his knowledge alone was worthy of everyone\u2019s respect. His knowledge wasn\u2019t inferior to Ye QingChen, and he was probably more knowledgeable than Mister Qin!</p><br/><p>The topic suddenly changed to the various Great Families and Mister Qin was the first to ask a question, \u201cTian\u2019er, since when did you become so popular? For that Third Master Yu to speak up on your behalf, I am not too surprised. Even for the DongFang Family to want to build good ties with you, it is still something within expectations. But since when did the NanGong Family also come to your side? This is what makes me the most puzzled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed and explained his alliance with the NanGong Family. As they heard that the head of the NanGong Family, NanGong TianLong, actually suffered a loss under Ling Tian, everyone couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>Ever since the start of the banquet, Meng LiGe had been observing Ling Tian and everyone else in the banquet and couldn\u2019t help but be startled! He had never seen such a harmonious relationship between teacher and student before. This Ling Tian was really a special breed! The way Mister Qin looked at Ling Tian, how did that seem like a teacher looking at a student? Mister Qin obviously looked like he was talking to his closest grandson. His face was full of love, joy, and gratification. At the same time, Mister Qin was also completely relaxed, without a trace of fear or reservedness when talking to this future family head.</p><br/><p>Such a master and subordinate relationship was something which Meng LiGe had always desired. When serving Wei ChengPing, this was something that would never happen! Comparing Ling Tian and Wei ChengPing, the difference was obvious. Ling Tian was trying to win over Mister Qin\u2019s heart for the purpose of winning over his heart, while Wei ChengPing was winning over his heart for winning over his strength! While the ending was similar, the difference in process was as wide as the heaven and earth! The former was like the gentle winds and light spring drizzle, gradually moistening something without even a trace. As such, one would be able to unknowingly accept serving his master with joy. As for the latter, it was like a fierce thunderstorm, with speed as the number one priority! While the former required a great deal of time, the effects were long-lasting. As for the latter, because of the short time spent building their relationship, there was a risk of betrayal after a period of time! Meng LiGe and Wei ChengPing were a fine example of this.</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Meng LiGe\u2019s began to look at Ling Tian with a look of praise.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian suddenly looked towards Meng LiGe and said seriously, \u201cMister Meng, I believe that you should already know your present circumstances and I will not beat about the bush in front of a wise man. Ling Tian is extremely worried about Mister\u2019s safety and will speak candidly. I hope that Mister will not blame me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe could vaguely guess what Ling Tian had to say and replied with a smile, \u201cYoung noble Ling can feel free to speak your mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian continued, \u201cWith Mister\u2019s wisdom, you were actually willing to serve under Wei ChengPing\u2019s wings. Ordinarily, such a thing shouldn\u2019t have happened with Mister\u2019s keen eyesight. This is something which Ling Tian is puzzled about and I seek guidance from Mister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe let out a bitter laugh before saying, \u201cYoung noble Ling is unaware of something. Many years back, my teacher owed the imperial family of Northern Wei a favor. Right when I had finally graduated from my teacher\u2019s teaching, the imperial family of Northern Wei came to find my teacher to seek a disciple to aid Northern Wei. Originally, my knowledge was far too shallow to take on such a task. However, I was the only one by my teacher\u2019s side at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, Meng LiGe shook his head and downed a glass of wine before continuing, \u201cMy teacher had always placed great emphasis on one\u2019s promises and my teacher just couldn\u2019t ignore Northern Wei. At the same time, he was also unwilling to ruin my future. Thus, he let me make the decision. As a disciple, how could I ignore the worries of my teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mister Qin suddenly stood up and gave a bow to Meng LiGe. Meng LiGe wanted to avoid the bow but was stopped by Mister Qin, \u201cJunior Brother, you cannot avoid this bow. This is something that you deserve. This is a bow from this foolish brother to thank you for your sacrifices. This brother is really guilty.\u201d As Mister Qin said that, tears filled his face.</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe let out a sigh, \u201cHow could I not repay the kindness from our teacher? For Senior Brother to say this, you are making me embarrassed.\u201d After pausing for a moment, Meng LiGe continued his story, \u201cWhen this little brother first arrived at Northern Wei, I realized that Crown Prince ChengPing was extremely narrow-minded but was capable in his means. He was resolute and ruthless in his actions, a talent to rule the nation! This little brother then thought that if he can treat me well and listen to at least half of my teachings, it wouldn\u2019t be a bad thing for me to stay in Northern Wei. However, I never imagined that he\u2026\u201d As Meng LiGe said that, he shook his head bitterly before suddenly letting out a carefree smile, \u201cHowever, that\u2019s also good. This little brother actually benefited from it and I no longer have to involve myself in the political whirlpool of the continent. It is really a blessing in disguise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian nodded his head and began to think carefully. Meng LiGe\u2019s final sentence was obviously being spoken to him. Meng LiGe was obviously trying to hint to Ling Tian to not rope him in. Thus, Ling Tian let out a smile, \u201cMister is straightforward with your words and how can Ling Tian possibly force you. While Ling Tian may not have any other abilities, I do have some principles for sure. How would I dare to force Mister to do what you don\u2019t want to? When the storm subsides, Mister can choose to leave if you want to. However, please remember that the door of the Ling Family will be open forever. Even if you can\u2019t stay for long, it would also be good if you can come and take a rest for a short while when you are tired from touring the continent. While the Ling residence isn\u2019t very reliable, it will be able to fend off the storms and rain for Mister. I hope that Mister will not reject me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe cupped his fists in reply, \u201cThank you young noble!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian gave a carefree smile and raised his glass, \u201cMeeting each other shows that we are fated. I wonder if Mister can discuss the situation of the continent with me? Just take it as a casual conversation in the banquet and you can feel free to say as you like. Ling Tian is all ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe shook his head with a laugh, \u201cYoung noble Ling is really crafty!\u201d After falling into deep consideration for a moment, Meng LiGe suddenly looked up at Ling Tian seriously, \u201cBefore this, I want to ask young noble a question. I hope that young noble will reply me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian said seriously, \u201cFeel free to ask; as long as I can answer it, I won\u2019t hold anything back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe stared at Ling Tian and asked with an imposing manner, \u201cI wish to ask young noble what are commoners to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCommoners?\u201d Ling Tian laughed, \u201cMister, with regards to what commoners are, it is dependant on the status of the person judging their worth. With a different status, the way they judge commoners would definitely be different. Does Mister agree with me? Does Mister really think that I will answer you freely at this moment and place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe frowned and replied, \u201cWill young noble enlighten me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian twirled the wine glass in his hand and smiled, \u201cIf Mister has a question, I will naturally have to be honest. In my eyes, the commoners of the world are no more than ants!\u201d</p><br/><p>The faces of everyone present changed immediately! None of them expected Ling Tian to reply in such a manner! Mister Qin began to frown with a face of displeasure.</p><br/><p>As though he understood something, Meng LiGe began to probe Ling Tian, \u201cYoung noble seems to have something else to say. How can this be freely speaking your mind?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed and said with a deep tone, \u201cThat\u2019s right! If I am a commoner, then the commoners of the world will be like flesh and blood to me. However, I am now born in a Great Family and if there are no other changes, commoners are no different from ants in my heart. This is indeed what I feel! Does Mister not believe me?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

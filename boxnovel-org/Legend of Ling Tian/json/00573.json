He then glared at Ling Chi fiercely and waved his fists around.</p><br/><p>\u201cYellow\u2026 err, Seventeen, do you have some trouble?\u201d Ling Jian was too used to using Ling Seventeen\u2019s nickname and had almost blurted it out without thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t \u2018some trouble\u2019 at all but it is a huge trouble,\u201d Ling Seventeen said with a depressed look. \u201cI have never been afraid of death but am afraid that my death wouldn\u2019t be sufficient to complete the young noble\u2019s mission. That would be horrible and extremely embarrassing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ling Jian looked at Ling Seventeen with a smile which didn\u2019t seem like a smile. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a need for you to rush, young noble is here already. Let me tell him now that Ling Seventeen does not have the ability to complete this mission. I believe that the young noble will understand you for sure.\u201d Ling Jian\u2019s voice suddenly turned cold and he turned and walked away.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t\u2026 brother Jian, ancestor Jian\u2026\u201d Ling Seventeen\u2019s burly figure pounced forward and grabbed onto Ling Jian\u2019s calves and was dragged by Ling Jian along the ground for a short few feet, \u201cMy dear ancestor, please don\u2019t play with me. I will die\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sat on a smooth rock with a bunch of burly men seated opposite him respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak, what kind of difficulties do you have?\u201d Ling Tian looked at the ape-like Ling Seventeen in front of him and could not help but be shocked. When he was in the courtyard, Ling Seventeen could already eat more than the others and had a larger built as compared to his peers. In just a short few years, Ling Seventeen had grown horizontally and currently looked like a rectangle. In a couple of years, who knows if he would turn into a square.</p><br/><p>Especially his extremely boorish face and his needle-like beard. No one would ever be able to imagine that this boorish man who looked as though he was more than thirty years old was actually less than eighteen! Ling Tian almost suspected that Ling Seventeen had taken steroids.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, this subordinate wants to launch an ambush to capture the surrounding twenty or so lookout stations before sending men to guard the ends of the two roads. The others will then dig up this segment of the road and sister Chen\u2019s mission would be complete.\u201d Ling Seventeen scratched his hair and a handful of dandruff fell off as he said helplessly, \u201cIt is a pity that we do not have enough manpower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPuchi!\u201d Ling Seventeen was greeted with a face full of water and never expected that his young noble would spit out his mouthful of water.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had just received the gourd which Ling Chi offered him and drank a mouthful of water but was choked by the words that Ling Seventeen said. \u201cWhat did you say? Ambush more than twenty lookout stations? Guard the two ends of the road? Dig the road up??\u201d</p><br/><p>Lling Tian stood up and kicked Ling Seventeen\u2019s burly shoulders with exasperation. \u201cDammit! Without 5000 soldiers at least, it would be impossible to attack more than twenty lookout stations at the same time. On top of that, if you want to guard the two ends of the road, you would need 50,000 soldiers at the very least and even then, you guys may not be able to guard the road! As for digging the road up, while the idea isn\u2019t bad\u2026 the road is filled with iron and rocks two feet underground. How do you plan to dig it up? You only have a mere thousand soldiers and you actually came up with such a huge plan? I really don\u2019t know if I should call you a genius or idiot! If I were to really go with your plan, I might as well bring all of our soldiers over to have a final battle with the Xiao Family. What is the point of talking about disrupting their resupply route? To think that you really came up with such a plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026 yellow gold is truly pigheaded!\u201d Ling Chi gloated by the side.</p><br/><p>After being sent rolling by Ling Tian, Ling Seventeen stood up foolishly with a few leaves stuck onto his bird nest like hair. He then blinked his eyes with doubt and asked, \u201cErr\u2026 sister Chen was the one who said that\u2026 we need to destroy the resupply route. If we don\u2019t dig up the road, how should we destroy it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaiz!\u201d Ling Tian let out a long sigh and had the urge to bang his head on the rock. He was truly playing music to a bull.</p><br/><p>\u201cPig! Do you really need to touch the road to destroy the resupply route?\u201d Ling Jian let out a flurry of fists, hating the fact that Ling Seventeen had truly thrown his face. \u201cSetting fire to burn it is destroying the resupply route. Killing them all is also destroying the resupply route. Dammit, even if you guys infiltrate the Xiao Residence to kill them all cleanly, it would still be destroying the resupply route! Do you understand?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Seventeen used one hand to cover his face and the other to guard his two important parts, implementing the battle philosophy which Ling Tian had taught him back then, \u201cCover his face, hug his balls and allow the other party to punch and kick as they like!\u201d His body began shaking from left to right as he begged for mercy, \u201cBrother Jian\u2026 I will pick some soldiers to infiltrate the Xiao Residence to kill\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k!\u201d Ling Tian was completely speechless!</p><br/><p>The saying of \u2018a disciple truly takes after his master\u2019 was truly right. Ling Jian\u2019s idea was truly completely rotten and wasn\u2019t any much better than Ling Seventeen\u2019s plan of guarding the ends of the road and digging up the road! To think that he would have a look of righteousness on his face, scolding his subordinate for being a pig. In actual fact, he wasn\u2019t any much better than Ling Seventeen.</p><br/><p>Kill everyone? If they really killed everyone, what was the point of destroying the resupply route? Wasn\u2019t this akin to taking off his pants to fart?!</p><br/><p>A few hundred thousand soldiers, even if they stood still and allowed you to kill them, you would require a few months to complete the task!</p><br/><p>\u201cStop fooling around! All of you are a bunch of pig heads! Pot calling the kettle black!\u201d Ling Tian grunted, \u201cShow me the map of the surrounding area!\u201d</p><br/><p>It seems like I will still have to rely on myself. Ling Tian sighed helplessly. It was completely nonsensical to rely on a bandit and assassin to destroy a military resupply route! Just what was Meng LiGe thinking about? You have to know, every occupation has a specialty\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Jian finally stopping his attack, Ling Seventeen carefully removed his hands from his head and crotch. To the thick-skinned Ling Seventeen, this round of beating was truly nothing much. Turning around and seeing his subordinates look at him in a daze, he immediately flew into a rage, \u201cDidn\u2019t you guys hear that young noble wants the map? Aren\u2019t all of you b<em>st</em>rds going to fetch the map? A bunch of pig heads without any reaction! Are you guys going to wait for my whip to teach you guys a lesson?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a loud bang, the bandits scattered like the birds and hurriedly ran to fetch the map\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian frowned and let out a sigh. In order to fetch a map which was a mere few grams, more than a hundred people were required to fetch it\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Seventeen turned around in embarrassment and scratched his head foolishly, \u201cYoung noble please don\u2019t be anxious\u2026 err, the children are going to fetch the map and it would arrive soon. Hehehe\u2026 these fellows are a little slow\u2026 it isn\u2019t much, I only need to give them a good beating\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at the bushy face in front of him and was speechless. At the same time, he felt his stomach churning in disgust before sighing and saying weakly, \u201cSeventeen, I finally understand why you unloaded the yellow gold into your pants back then and also completely understand Ling Jian\u2019s mood when training you. It isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Seventeen was dumbfounded with his jaws down in shock. He completely could not understand how this matter was related to his embarrassing past. Besides that, what has this got to do with his boss Ling Jian? What wasn\u2019t easy for Ling Jian? Their young noble\u2019s words were truly deep and profound and he was truly a well-learned individual.</p><br/><p>Feng Mo, Ling Jian, and Ling Chi looked at the dumbfounded Ling Seventeen and their faces contorted from holding in their laughter.</p><br/><p>The sound of footsteps broke Ling Seventeen\u2019s doubt and snatched the map from the hands of his subordinate. He then turned around and presented the map with both his arms raised as though he was presenting a treasure to the king, \u201cYoung noble, hehe, the map is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSssss\u2026\u201d In a moment of anxiousness, a large hole was torn in the fragile map and Ling Tian who witnessed it was about to blow up.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram to the side!\u201d Ling Jian kicked Ling Seventeen in the ass and cursed.</p><br/><p>Ling Seventeen held onto his ass and stood by the side shamelessly. At the same time, he winked at Ling Chi, \u201cHehe, dog egg, hehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chi rolled his eyes and looked to the side. Facing a shameless person like Ling Seventeen, Ling Chi was truly helpless. Of course, there also wasn\u2019t a need for him to flare up at Ling Seventeen as flaring up at Ling Seventeen was just a waste of effort. Even if you went completely bonkers from anger, Ling Seventeen wouldn\u2019t understand why you were angry.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian frowned and looked at the gigantic map carefully. After considering for a long time, he finally made up his mind and pointed to the map, \u201cIt shall be here!\u201d He then revealed a helpless smile. Ling Jian could clearly feel that there was a dense feeling of pity in Ling Tian\u2019s eyes and he could not help but be stunned. Why? Why would Ling Tian be acting in such a manner?</p><br/><p>Looking at where Ling Tian\u2019s finger was pointing at, Ling Jian saw a large lake on the map with a blue stream beneath it. Following along the stream, Ling Jian noticed that it was surrounded by two tall peaks by the side with a large road in the center. Following that, there was a sturdy looking castle and it was the number one perilous location of the southeast, the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass! This was also the Xiao Family\u2019s natural barrier towards invaders!</p><br/><p>After going through the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass, they would be greeted with three thousand miles of fertile land and that was where the true territory of the Xiao Family was. It was also the reason why no other power was able to infiltrate into the Xiao Family\u2019s territory for the past 500 years!</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether the Xiao Family wanted to send out armies or the outside world wanted to invade them, it was necessary to pass through the Heavenly Water Ravine Passing and there wasn\u2019t a second path! The mountains which spanned across a couple of thousand miles and the precipitously steep slopes that were high up in the clouds made it impossible for any army to surmount it!</p><br/><p>This Heavenly Water Ravine Pass was truly capable of blocking ten thousand soldiers with a single man! At this place which only required 2000 soldiers to defend steadily, the Xiao Family actually sent a whole ten battalions!</p><br/><p>Ten thousand men!</p><br/><p>This was only counting the ordinary troops and did not include the various personal guards, cavalry and other various troops. If all of these were to be added in, there would be 20,000 soldiers at the very least! Regardless of how terribly the Xiao Family loses on the outside, as long as they were able to protect this place, the three thousand miles of territory behind it would always be theirs! Even if all of their soldiers on the outside perished, the Xiao Family only needed a few decades of rest before they would be able to produce tens of thousands of soldiers again and rule the world!</p><br/><p>The grain of the Xiao Family was sent out from this place and the defense of the resupply route was watertight. There was no place for them to take action and even if they only wanted to cut off the supply of food for three days, it was an extremely challenging task! This was only possible if they could grasp control of this ancient pass within their hands! Apart from that, the Xiao Family would be able to repair any form of damage that they created in a short day or two. As for harassment tactics, that was completely useless.</p><br/><p>In front of this massive obstacle, all of Ling Tian and Meng LiGe\u2019s plans were armchair theories!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian resolutely decided that things probably wouldn\u2019t end at just disrupting the resupply routes of the Xiao Family!</p><br/><p>Since they wanted to play, they should increase the stakes and bring forward the final battle!</p><br/><p>A crazy battle intent burned in Ling Tian\u2019s heart! It is either this half of the continent becomes peaceful from now on or the whole continent shall break out into chaos!</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes young noble want to seize the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass?\u201d Ling Jian took in a breath of cold air. Even the reckless Ling Jian could not see any hopes for this plan to work out. The generals guarding this pass had always been the direct descendants of the Xiao Family and would be loyal to the Xiao Family to the very end. At the same time, they were also all experts among experts!</p><br/><p>How would it be an easy task to take over the pass in one swoop!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was certain that if he and his young noble wanted to infiltrate the pass, they would be able to do so with a couple of martial arts experts and their movement techniques. However, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for them to retreat fully after infiltrating the pass, and as for seizing the control of the pass\u2026 even with Ling Jian\u2019s arrogance and faith in Ling Tian\u2019s strength, he felt that it was no more than a joke!</p><br/><p>A mysterious smile could be seen on Ling Tian\u2019s face, \u201cWith our strength, it would indeed be a dream for us to capture the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass. But what if I said that we want to destroy it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian had the sudden urge to roll his eyes with disdain. If not for the fact that Ling Tian was a deity-like existence to Ling Jian, Ling Jian would definitely blurt out: Young noble, do you have a fever? If there is really a way to destroy this pass, would the experts of the continent allow it to remain for a few hundred years?!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could naturally tell what Ling Jian was thinking about and smiled, \u201cUnder normal circumstances, my idea would be no more than a dream. However, there isn\u2019t anything absolute in the world. Ling Jian, have you seen these two mountain peaks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian looked at where Ling Tian was pointing at and said, \u201cThese two mountain peaks lie behind the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass and are the two highest points of the ridgeline. What does this have to do with our plan? Does young noble have other plans? However, how could these two mountains be moved by human strength?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sneered and traced out the azure river with his finger and said with a devilish smile, \u201cEven if our human strength is lacking, the forces of nature are unparalleled. A large amount of river water flows past these two mountain peaks and after thousands of years of weathering, a precipice has been formed. The road which the Xiao Family has been maintaining for a thousand years is on the other side of the mountain. Even though the road is broad, there is only a single road with steep mountains on both sides. If these two mountains were to collapse, it would definitely cut off the flow of the river. At that time, where will all the water flow to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe river water will definitely flow into the mountain road and may even drown the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass. If that\u2019s the case, not to mention three days, even if the Xiao Family was given three months they may not be able to redirect the river water. If that happens we would have destroyed the food resupply route and even sending out a single soldier would be of great difficulty. If that\u2019s the case, the 450,000 soldiers on the outside would be left without any reinforcements.\u201d Ling Jian shook his head with a depressed look, \u201cHowever, why would the mountain peak collapse without a reason? It probably wouldn\u2019t be completely destroyed even if lightning strikes it. As for causing the mountain to collapse with human force, there isn\u2019t even a need to think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI naturally have a plan!\u201d Ling Tian smiled with confidence before his face turned serious, \u201cSend my orders!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone immediately straightened their backs and sat up attentively.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Seventeen, pick out a few guides familiar with the place to be the guides of these troops. Feng Mo\u2019s troops are to be split into five groups and will take turns to harass the lookout stations. Regardless of whether or not they are successful, they are to retreat after a single wave of attacks and are not to drag out the battle. However, the attacks must happen frequently and this matter cannot be delayed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the rest, collect large amounts of sulfur, saltpeter, and charcoal. The more the better! I have my own use for them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Mo, immediately send a message to the Courtyard to ensure that the soldiers\u2019 morale is high. Regardless of the price, they are to defend against the attacks of Southern Zheng and the Xiao Family and wait for my good news.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides that, inform the advisor to mobilize all of our troops. Apart from those at the Southern Zheng\u2019s battlefield, all other troops are to be sent to the east.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommand Shen RuHu is to take a roundabout route to get here. They are to fortify their defenses and prepare for a bitter battle! Tell the general to get ready to swallow up the Xiao Family\u2019s 400,000 man army! Over the next few days, the Xiao Family\u2019s army will definitely fall into chaos!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSend my orders to my father\u2019s army. The moment we start the battle with the Xiao Family on the east, they are to swallow up Southern Zheng in the quickest time possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Jian, order the remaining forces of the First Pavilion stationed in the Courtyard to go down south and listen to my father\u2019s orders. They are to assist the army to the south and I allow them to carry out assassination missions. Within half a month after battle breaks out in the east, I want to receive news of Southern Zheng being captured! They will then send their army up north and towards Eastern Zhao!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInform DongFang JingLei to create chaos in Eastern Zhao within three days. Even if he has to sacrifice all of his men, he is to complete this mission! Tell DongFang JingLei that regardless of how much he loses, I will pay him back double! But if he does not complete the mission, not a single member of the DongFang Family will be left alive! I will not go back on my word!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Jian and Ling Chi, pick out a hundred elites capable of scaling this mountain and await my orders! They should be prepared to go past the mountain and I will have further orders for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t any room for negotiations and all of these orders are to be carried out immediately! Those who defy my orders will be dealt with by military law!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then looked at the two tall peaks afar with killing intent in his eyes and muttered under his breath, \u201cSince we want to play, let us go all in! Let me see how the Xiao Family army is going to survive after losing their food supply.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn three months time, I will unite my half of the continent and only leave the Xiao Family\u2019s territory alone. At that time, the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass will be in my hands and the Xiao Family won\u2019t be a cause for concern!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian grinned ferociously, \u201cI originally didn\u2019t want to do this but since the Xiao Family has this natural indestructible obstacle that no power is able to threaten, hehehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s chuckle filled with killing intent made everyone present feel their backs turn cold and hair stand.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that Miss Li Xue wasn\u2019t present today. Only Li Xue would be able to guess what was going on in Ling Tian\u2019s head. If Li Xue was present today, she would also be laughing and looking forward to the scene in future\u2026</p><br/><p>Even though none of the members present in this meeting could understand the rationale for Ling Tian\u2019s orders, they still swiftly carried it out because of the faith they had in Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian thought about everything that Ling Tian had said and could feel his blood boiling with excitement. Although he didn\u2019t know what Ling Tian wanted to do, based on his understanding of Ling Tian, this plan of his must definitely be one that will shake the heavens and will definitely succeed!</p><br/><p>If the young noble wants to do something, how would it possibly fail!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian had a sudden premonition that the whole continent would be transformed because of Ling Tian\u2019s orders today!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stood up at the peak of the mountain and his gaze swept past the surroundings. Even with Ling Tian\u2019s eyesight, the barracks beneath the mountain looked like small little soybeans.</p><br/><p>The sky seemed to have been cleaned of all its clouds and it was blue for ten thousand miles!</p><br/><p>The cold breeze swept past Ling Tian\u2019s face and his black robes fluttered in the winds. His black hair drifted in the winds and Ling Jian stood guard behind him silently. Looking at the tall and slim back view of Ling Tian, Ling Jian suddenly felt a deep reverence.</p><br/><p>Even though they were only a couple of steps away from each other, Ling Jian felt as though Ling Tian was high up in the skies! In this life of his, Ling Jian felt that he would never be able to achieve such heights!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s silhouette was clearly outlined by the sun and it seemed as though there was a layer of golden light covering him.</p><br/><p>A thousand mountains and rivers were all beneath his feet!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe world is like a painting, who will rise and who will fall?\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s eyes were narrowed and a bloody killing intent flashed past his eyes. Despite only muttering a single phrase quietly, a powerful killing intent was suppressed within it! This was something that Ling Jian could clearly feel.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

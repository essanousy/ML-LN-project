Looking at both Ling Jian and Li Xue, she could not help but chuckle and said softly, \u201cYoung noble, since everything has been prepared, you should give the order. Ah\u2019Jian has always looked down on ladies and after losing to me previously, he remains unresigned in his heart up until now. It would also be a good thing for sister Li Xue to show him her prowess. She can show him what it means for there to always be someone more powerful than him!\u201d The second half of her words were said to Li Xue.</p><br/><p>Li Xue broke out into a bright smile and she intentionally swept her gaze past Ling Tian\u2019s face before saying confidently, \u201cYounger sister Ling Chen, I will definitely make you satisfied today! A while later, I will show this master assassin how a pig head is created. Master assassin Ling, First Pavilion Master, it seems like you are already addicted to drinking goldthread water\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian replied with a smirk, \u201cIt is still undecided just who will be the one drinking the goldthread water! What is the point of bragging at this moment?!\u201d Following that he shouted, \u201cMen!\u201d Following which, Ling Chi, Ling Lei and Ling Dian entered together carrying a large tub of water, dried leaves, and nine huge bowls!</p><br/><p>The three of them gave a respectful bow to Ling Tian before busily getting to work. Their actions were extremely well-coordinated and they must have practiced before this for sure. It seems like Ling Jian was truly well prepared. Not only did he prepare the goldthread, he even called three of his brothers over as witnesses.</p><br/><p>In just a short few moments, a large stove was set up in the corner of the yard and a metal pot hung over it. Following that, a large bucket of water was poured into it and Ling Jian delightedly threw in a large packet of goldthread.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could not help but be stunned as he burst out laughing, \u201cAh\u2019Jian, you are truly well prepared. Regardless of who the victor is, I will be greeted with a good show! Hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian remained calm and replied respectfully, \u201cYoung noble has taught Ling Jian that I must definitely make sufficient preparations before taking action!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed to the point he could barely breathe, \u201cAlright, you indeed lived up to my teachings and your preparatory work is truly sufficient. Since both of you refuse to back down and so much preparation has already been made, I am also willing to witness a good show.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue looked at the metal pot with a smile that didn\u2019t seem like a smile. She then looked at Ling Jian calmly without an expression.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian cupped his fists and the delighted expression of being able to take his vengeance could be seen. \u201cMay young noble give the order and allow us to battle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian exchanged gazes with Ling Chen and Li Xue before replying, \u201cSince the two of you insists on fighting, then the two of you shall fight here and now! Ling Chi, raise the fire! The time taken for the water to boil will be the time limit of your fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the two of you are going to fight, there must be a few rules. Number one, you are not allowed to leave this yard. Number two, you are not allowed to affect the fire. Number three, I allow both of you to go all-out. Injuries are fine but death is forbidden!\u201d Ling Tian looked at the two of them and said slowly.</p><br/><p>These three conditions were extremely loose. Regardless of whether it was Li Xue or Ling Jian, they would both aim to kill the moment they took action. Furthermore, Ling Jian had the advantage in this aspect. If his killing moves were restricted, Ling Jian\u2019s battle prowess would be largely restricted and it definitely wouldn\u2019t be fair. Thus, Ling Tian decided to let them go all out. As for the second rule, it was actually biased towards Ling Jian. With Li Xue\u2019s Divine Ice Formula, she could easily freeze the flames and the water of the pot would never boil! Of course, this was something that Ling Jian would never know.</p><br/><p>A violent glow exploded forth from Ling Jian\u2019s eyes and he looked at Ling Tian with gratitude before taking a few steps back.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s expression was solemn and with every step he took, it was as though there was a mountain resting on his shoulders becoming heavier and heavier. The black robes that he was wearing fluttered like there was a wind and after seven steps, Ling Jian\u2019s clothes fluttered like he was standing on a mountain peak! At this moment, the whole yard was filled with silence and even the trees in the distance were completely motionless.</p><br/><p>This form of extreme silence was extremely strange.</p><br/><p>With just the momentum of walking backward, Ling Jian was able to accumulate his aura to the peak! At this moment, Ling Jian was like the boundless ocean, steady and impenetrable!</p><br/><p>Looking at Ling Jian\u2019s fluttering clothes and hair despite the lack of wind, a look of praise could be seen in Ling Tian\u2019s eyes. Even Ling Tian didn\u2019t expect that Ling Jian\u2019s improvement was so huge! It was truly out of his expectations!</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Chen said something well: There was always someone stronger!</p><br/><p>Li Xue chuckled and seemed to be completely unaffected by the huge pressure that Ling Jian was emanating. She then took a few casual steps back and the distance between the two of them widened to fifty feet. As she looked at Ling Jian in the eye, her white robes were completely still. The powerful pressure and violent winds stirred up by Ling Jian\u2019s inner qi seemed to be completely neutralized when it was in front of Li Xue.</p><br/><p>Li Xue still had a leisurely expression as though she did not do anything at all. Facing Ling Jian who had unleashed his aura, she undoubtedly had the upper hand!</p><br/><p>Ling Chi, Ling Lei, and Ling Dian could naturally understand the phenomenon before their eyes and could not help but be shocked. Despite their confidence in Ling Jian, they were inevitably worried for him. It seems like brother Jian\u2019s opponent was extremely powerful!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Tian let out an order, \u201cRaise the fire!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Ling Chi lit up the dry wood and leaves under the pot and the boiling heat filled the yard!</p><br/><p>With a clanging sound, Ling Jian drew his sword. However, there was something extremely strange about his actions. Before his sword had fully left its sheath, the sky was filled with the sound of his treasured sword leaving its sheath. The moment Ling Jian stretched his arms out, it was as though there were countless swords leaving their sheaths at the same moment!</p><br/><p>Before his sword left its sheath, the powerful sword qi had already enveloped the whole yard!</p><br/><p>Li Xue took in a deep breath and her expression remained the same. However, the leisurely look in her eyes was replaced by one of seriousness. Although she did not make a single move, the impression which she gave off was one that she had already moved. It was as though her snow-white figure was levitating in mid-air with her cold gaze being locked onto Ling Jian!</p><br/><p>The moment Ling Jian drew his sword, he successfully climbed out from his disadvantage and the sound of countless swords being drawn sliced through Li Xue\u2019s inner qi which was locked onto him!</p><br/><p>From this moment, victory and defeat were difficult to predict.</p><br/><p>Ling Chi, Ling Lei, and Ling Dian heaved a sigh of relief together. Their brother Jian was truly magnificent. As long as he had a sword in his hand, he would be the asura! How would a lass be able to block such an aura?</p><br/><p>In their eyes, since their brother Jian was no longer at the disadvantage, victory would definitely belong to him.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt Ling Chen\u2019s soft palm holding onto his hand and a nervous voice in his ears, \u201cYoung noble, who do you think will emerge victorious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Both Li Xue and Ling Jian\u2019s cultivation weren\u2019t below Ling Chen\u2019s and she couldn\u2019t accurately point out who had the upper hand!</p><br/><p>With his eagle eyes, Ling Tian studied every little action of the two and said in a soft voice, \u201cAh\u2019Jian\u2019s improvement over the past few months is truly stunning and beyond my expectations. However, that would be depending on who he is compared against. From the start of the battle, Li Xue had the upper hand in the competition of their auras. Despite Ling Jian wiping out his disadvantage by drawing his sword, he had already lost the initiative.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen whispered, \u201cDoes young noble think that Ah\u2019Jian will lose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled, \u201cThis would depend on Ling Jian\u2019s confidence and willpower. The larger his confidence and willpower, the harder he would fall. If Ling Jian was not so confident and eager of his victory before the start of the battle, things would be easier for him instead. However, Ah\u2019Jian is currently on the passive side. If not, with his current strength, it wouldn\u2019t be easy for Li Xue to attain victory and it would be extremely difficult for her to do so before the water boils!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen replied with an \u2018Oh\u2019 and fell into thought.</p><br/><p>With the flash of a white light, Ling Jian\u2019s sword was finally out of its sheath and a brilliant splendor emanated from it.</p><br/><p>Before his sword was fully out of its sheath, it let out a heaven-shaking commotion as though there were ten thousand horses galloping through the grasslands. But at the actual moment when the sword left its sheath, it was completely silent!</p><br/><p>This was an extreme change!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian gasped, \u201cLing Jian\u2019s talents truly leave me in admiration. However, it is truly a pity. If he is able to take another step, he would be comparable to Li Xue and the outcome wouldn\u2019t be his miserable defeat. It is a pity that he is still missing a single step.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen was stunned, \u201cIf he is only missing a single step, there shouldn\u2019t be a huge gap between them right? Is he truly unable to escape from the plight of a miserable defeat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled, \u201cChen\u2019er, you can be considered a martial arts grandmaster as well. Why are you making such an amateurish remark? Don\u2019t you know the logic of \u2018The difference of a single centimeter can seem like a thousand miles\u2019? In terms of cultivation, confidence, and strength, Ling Jian wouldn\u2019t be too far away from Li Xue. However, there is still a gap between the two of their realms. If this was before Ah\u2019Jian went to Northern Wei, there wouldn\u2019t be a need for this competition at all. However, even with a huge improvement to his strength, Ling Jian is still lacking in his realm. Thus, Ling Jian is sure to lose!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s eyes narrowed and her right foot took half a step forward. With her skinny figure leaning forward slightly, Ling Jian suddenly felt an immense increase in pressure and the dirt on the ground was stirred up. The dirt and dust on the ground then rushed towards Ling Jian like the waves striking a beach as though there was a commander leading it.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen praised, \u201cThis technique of elder sister Li Xue is truly beautiful. I surely wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s long sword slashed down and he struck an empty spot with a lightning-fast motion without the slightest bit of wind. While this sword was as fast as lightning, it had a mysterious phenomenon in the eyes of everyone else present.</p><br/><p>The others present witnessed an extremely strange sight. The long sword was initially lifted up above Ling Jian\u2019s head and this was already extremely strange in the face of an enemy. This slashing motion of Ling Jian had started from above his head and everyone could actually clearly see how the slashing motion was broken down into a few parts.</p><br/><p>Slashing down from the top of his head was the first action. Falling further was another action. His sword elegantly descending to the height of his shoulders with the tip of his sword pointed out was the last. On the ground, the dust and dirt beneath him also formed a half-foot wave and rolled forward in both a speedy and gentle manner.</p><br/><p>The moment Ling Jian\u2019s wave of dust rolled forward, Ling Tian frowned and shook his head slightly before letting out a soft sigh.</p></div>\n</div>"}

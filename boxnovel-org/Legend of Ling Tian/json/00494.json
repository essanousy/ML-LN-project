However, what would a little maid be able to do?</p><br/><p>The moment NanGong Yu issued her command, the \u2018burden\u2019 had suddenly disappeared as though she had never appeared before\u2026 The moment the maid disappeared, the temperature of the surroundings seemed to have dropped and a cool wind began blowing. At the same time, muffled groans sounded softly in the rear, but the men who were blinded by lust completely ignored those sounds\u2026</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s figure was like lightning, weaving through the surroundings of the battlefield and her dagger gleamed in the sun. One by one, the many guards of the NanGong Family hiding in the dark and the experts surveilling the area died under her dagger. In just a short few moments, more than 15 people died under Li Xue\u2019s hands. At the moment, Li Xue no longer looked like an ordinary maid and her eyes were filled with coldness. Not a single speck of dust could be seen on her dagger and not a single drop of blood remained on it. It was like a sacred jade tree in the imperial palace, untainted by even a single speck of dust.</p><br/><p>After the dagger was pulled out of a person\u2019s throat, it would be swiftly stabbed into another person\u2019s heart. Li Xue rhythmically reaped the lives of the many experts like she was a farmer, reaping the harvest of her crops with joy and even a tinge of excitement. Li Xue was extremely focused at the bloody task at hand, and she even felt that it was filled with art.</p><br/><p>In fact, she did not even look back for a moment as though she wasn\u2019t worried in the slightest about Ling Chen facing over a hundred experts alone. Li Xue knew that their mission today wasn\u2019t to wait for reinforcements but to annihilate their enemies! In the first half of the battle, her own mission was to completely wipe out the NanGong Family experts who were in the periphery!</p><br/><p>Not a single NanGong Family member who assaulted them today would be allowed to leave!</p><br/><p>They must all die today! Not for the reason of concealing their secrets but because of the words that NanGong Yu had said previously. Those words of hers had sentenced the NanGong Family to the fate of being wiped out and erased from the world forever!</p><br/><p>Behind her, Li Xue could feel an exploding ball of cold and the blistering hot seventh month seemed to have turned into the chilly winter! Li Xue revealed a smile on her face; this present scenario was intentionally created by her and Ling Chen finally revealed killing intent! Furthermore, she revealed her newly cultivated eighth level of the Divine Ice Formula from the start! It was sufficient to see the depth of hatred she had towards NanGong Yu and the other NanGong Family members!</p><br/><p>For Ling Chen to not send out a signal to Ling Lei and the rest who were already hidden in ambush, it meant that she wanted to personally take care of the people in front of her! This was the result that Li Xue wanted to see the most! The thing which Ling Chen lacked the most would be forced out by Li Xue during the period when Ling Tian wasn\u2019t here! If not, Ling Chen would still face some dangers in the future!</p><br/><p>The thing that Ling Chen lacked the most was undoubtedly the intent to kill! Currently, it seemed like Li Xue was extremely successful.</p><br/><p>All of these years, Ling Tian and Ling Jian were like two tall mountain peaks guarding in front of Ling Chen. While Ling Chen had a set of outstanding martial arts, she never had the chance to fight someone to the death. In recent times, the only chance she had was when she faced Ye BaiFei, but she was unable to kill her opponent at that time! Thus, Ling Chen\u2019s hands were still clean up until now and she had never touched the blood of anyone else.</p><br/><p>Today, when her most beloved man was being chased by a peerless expert and her closest brother was heavily injured, the NanGong Family decided to hit them when they were down. The NanGong Family first tried to ambush Ling Tian and after being killed by Ling Tian instead, the remaining people actually had the cheek to seek revenge with the Ling Family instead of finding a place to hide from the Ling Family\u2019s revenge! They were shameless to the extreme! Furthermore, they even came with such despicable and vile thoughts in their heads!</p><br/><p>This was the first time that Ling Chen was truly furious! Her killing intent could no longer be suppressed and the ten plus years of hidden killing intent was unsealed and unleashed! With the young noble absent and Ling Jian absent, I, Ling Chen, will still be around in the Ling Family Courtyard!</p><br/><p>I will not be the one to shame young noble\u2019s majesty!</p><br/><p>All of you can use your lives to fully enjoy my rage!</p><br/><p>Ling Chen glared at the NanGong Family members who were pouncing over and her glare turned cold. Her jade-like hands were then revealed from her sleeves and a layer of barely visible frosty white fog emanated from underneath her feet. On the ground, a layer of white frost quickly spread out in all directions swiftly with Ling Chen as the center! Ling Chen remained at the same spot and stood in the middle of the white frost like a jade sculpture. She looked at her enemies coldly, and a merciless, ruthless, and even cruel glow could be seen in her eyes!</p><br/><p>Before the NanGong Family members could even reach Ling Chen, the rapidly expanding layer of frost had already extended behind NanGong Yu. Everywhere the frost expanded to seemed to have formed a special domain and everyone within the domain could not help but shiver uncontrollably!</p><br/><p>Without an exception!</p><br/><p>A thunderous roar sounded, and NanGong TianHu descended from the sky with a violent gust of wind. He launched a powerful palm strike towards Ling Chen and before his palm strike even landed, the winds generated from his palm strike had already sent the dust and vegetation flying! With his acute senses of a XianTian expert, NanGong TianHu could vaguely feel that Ling Chen wasn\u2019t someone easily provoked. This lass was definitely not someone easy to deal with! Thus, he used almost all of his strength in this palm strike of his and his previously teasing look had completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen lowered her head and her body remained motionless like a mountain. She then lifted up her right hand calmly and when she had raised it halfway, she suddenly flipped her palm up towards the sky and sent out a powerful strike! All of her actions were extremely slow and each of her actions could be clearly seen by everyone. Coupled with her beautiful appearance, she looked like a fairy dancing beautifully on the moon.</p><br/><p>However, it was her slow actions that restrained NanGong TianHu\u2019s lightning speed! With a loud bang, both of their palms connected!</p><br/><p>The result of the clash was completely unexpected!</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s dress fluttered in the wind and her feet sank into the ground up to her ankles. At the same time, her face flushed red and her beauty at this very moment was definitely soul-shaking. She then waved her left hand slowly and when she waved it halfway, a bright light suddenly shone in her palms and a long sword appeared in her hands. With a brilliant and sharp sword ray, it shot through the air!</p><br/><p>Despite there being so many people around, none of them were able to see when her sword was unsheathed, how it appeared in her hands and where it was kept before this!</p><br/><p>As the brilliant sword light sliced through the air, the frosty ground was suddenly filled with more than ten bloody scars! The fresh blood splashing all over the snow-white ground was like bright red flowers blooming all over! The more than ten warriors of the NanGong Family who were in the first wave retreated pitifully with mournful groans and blood sprayed out in all directions from their many wounds.</p><br/><p>In the end, Ling Chen still could not bear to kill them all directly. She only made them lose the ability to walk by slicing all of the tendons in their ankles or rupturing the arteries on their thighs. The accuracy of her strike and control of her strength was at the level of perfection and made one gasp with admiration!</p><br/><p>This was the first time Ling Chen launched such a vicious attack!</p><br/><p>The moment NanGong TianHu\u2019s palm strike connected with Ling Chen, he felt an extremely cold ball of qi assaulting his body! He felt the meridians on his body freezing up and an extremely powerful force striking on his palm. His descending figure then let out an odd groan and he retreated thirty feet away with a midair backflip. When he landed on the ground, his face first flushed red before it quickly turned completely pale. His burly figure then shivered vigorously as he spat out a mouthful of blood. However, this mouthful of blood immediately froze upon him spitting it out.</p><br/><p>A layer of frost covered his right arm and it was as though he had just taken a bath in the ocean and the salt crystals were left on his body after the water evaporated\u2026</p><br/><p>NanGong TianHu took in two deep breaths and circulated his inner qi a few cycles around his body before he was able to regain movement in his right arm which was sealed up by the icy-cold qi. However, the movement of his right hand was still rigid and when he wanted to clench his fists lightly, cracking sounds were continuously heard! NanGong TianHu raised his head and looked at Ling Chen\u2019s beautiful figure with a look of extreme fear in his eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>Who said this woman didn\u2019t know any martial arts or only had little accomplishment in her martial arts? This darn misinformation is going to cost all of our lives! The martial arts that she has displayed are already above Yu ManTian who had beaten me up badly! It may even be higher than that!</p><br/><p>NanGong TianHu\u2019s judgment was extremely accurate. After Ling Chen consumed the Great Cyclic Pellet, her cultivation was raised to the extreme small success XianTian stage and was definitely comparable to Yu ManLou. After Li Xue arrived and taught Ling Chen earnestly, Ling Chen achieved another breakthrough and had reached the strength Ling Tian displayed before leaving Sky Bearing. Not to mention the fact that Li Xue was around as reinforcement. Even if Ling Chen was alone, it was more than enough to deal with everyone present!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Chen did not have the interest to think about NanGong TianHu\u2019s feelings. She had already treated him as a dead man and she would never allow someone who had humiliated her young noble to remain alive in the world! Regardless if it was for herself or for her young noble\u2019s prestige!</p><br/><p>The next moment, Ling Chen stamped her foot, and the ground beneath her began cracking with a loud bang. She then raised her right leg and stamped down again. The soil beneath her feet immediately shot out in all directions, carrying with it her frosty inner qi! Every single fragment was as fast as lightning and they smashed into the formation of the NanGong Family warriors!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Ling Tian was flaunting my knowledge in front of the true experts previously and I seek your forgiveness!\u201d Without waiting for the elders to reply to him, Ling Tian walked out of the room.</p><br/><p>In the room, the six \u2018true experts\u2019 looked at Ling Tian\u2019s departing figure with their mouths open in speechless shock. A long while later, a series of curses exploded forth from the room, and the elders were even better at it than the little hoodlums on the streets\u2026</p><br/><p>If their resentment could kill, even a dozen Ling Tian\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be sufficient. If their flames of rage could burn, Sky Bearing would definitely be engulfed in a sea of flame right now.</p><br/><p>A long while later, Yu XiaoRan collapsed into the armchair weakly and said, \u201cOld Five and Six, the two of you are to return to the family at top speed to inform the family head. You must inform us of his decision at the fastest possible speed. This old man no longer has the face to meet family head and I do not wish to stay in this place for a second longer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian whistled as he walked in the snow feeling extremely delighted. Upon thinking about Yu ManLou\u2019s expression after seeing his letter, Ling Tian could not help but be filled with delight. As he walked in the snow, he suddenly remembered that Yu ManLou took in a new concubine under his urging. Who knows if this Yu Family Head was diligent during this period?</p><br/><p>Thinking about that, Ling Tian\u2019s body began to heat up and his little brother seemed to be raising his head. He immediately stopped walking and changed his direction towards Ling Chen\u2019s office. As he walked over, he began fantasizing about having some office romance in the snow\u2026</p><br/><p>His saliva began drooping down from the corner of his lips!</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t anyone in the room!</p><br/><p>Young noble Ling who had a belly full of lust had no place to vent it. Seeing Ling Chen\u2019s office empty, he rubbed his nose for a moment before another idea sprouted in his head. He then walked towards Yu BingYan\u2019s room but was disappointed again.</p><br/><p>How strange. In the freezing winter, where would these two lasses be? Ling Tian scratched his head in doubt. Haiz, if I am unable to find anyone, I shall go and tease the little beauty of the Xiao or Shui Family. Even if I cannot have a real battle with them, it would be fun to tease them still.</p><br/><p>Making a loop around the Courtyard, Ling Tian stood in the snow with depression. He wasn\u2019t able to find a single one of them!</p><br/><p>He still hadn\u2019t checked Miss Li Xue\u2019s room. However, Ling Tian would not go to Li Xue\u2019s room at this moment as that demoness was still at the peak of her anger. She definitely had a belly full of jealousy last night and he still teased her this morning. Then, she was further angered by Yu XiaoRan in the afternoon\u2026</p><br/><p>Currently, Li Xue was like a volcano on the verge of erupting. Wouldn\u2019t he be seeking trouble for himself if he found her now? It was best that he didn\u2019t tease her now lest he ended up burning himself.</p><br/><p>Of course, Ling Tian still had another solution in the Courtyard and he turned towards the little yard where Ling Jian and the other assassins of the First Pavilion stayed. Since Ling Tian had nothing else better to do, he could vent his frustrations on those little brats and train them at the same time. Just a while ago, Justice had trained Ling Feng, Yun, Lei and Dian until he was addicted to the feeling and the four of them would run whenever they see Justice! Ling Tian could also experience such a feeling!</p><br/><p>From afar, Ling Tian could hear loud laughter and the owner of the laughter was obviously laughing heartily. Ling Tian immediately went forward to take a look\u2026</p><br/><p>Currently, all of the assassins were excitedly seated around the fire as they heard Ling Jian describing how he made fun of the Yu Family elders. They were all filled with laughter and did not notice that their young noble who was at the peak of his frustration walking over.</p><br/><p>When Ling Tian walked over, Ling Jian was at the climax of the story, \u201c\u2026 when I gave that old fogey a tight slap to the face, that old fogey flew into a rage\u2026. then\u2026 at this moment, young noble suddenly appeared\u2026\u201d Ling Jian paused for a while intentionally to build up the suspense.</p><br/><p>The few of them who were eager to hear the continuation of the story asked eagerly, \u201cWhat did young noble say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian chuckled and stretched lazily, \u201cTake a guess.\u201d</p><br/><p>The few of them burst out laughing together and a few others said together, \u201cIs there still a need to guess? The thickness of those old fogies\u2019 skin would be like the thickness of the Ling Family Courtyard\u2019s wall at the very most. However, our young noble\u2019s skin is as thick as two rounds of our Ling Family Courtyard\u2019s walls! He would only need to use 30% of his ability and make an unreasonable statement! Those old fogies would immediately be rendered speechless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d Everyone burst out laughing together as they slapped their thighs. A few of them laughed to the point their tears were oozing out.</p><br/><p>The few of them did indeed understand Ling Tian very well. However, they were just too unlucky\u2026</p><br/><p>With a loud bang, the door of the room flew open and young noble Ling Tian stood outside of the door with a blackened expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs my skin very thick? Is it that the thickness of my skin is enough to go two times around my face? Half of my face stands for my shamelessness and the other half my impudence?! Can someone answer me clearly!\u201d Ling Tian clenched his teeth and said slowly.</p><br/><p>Pin-drop silence!</p><br/><p>Everyone had a look of despair on their faces. Ling Chi looked at Ling Tian and his mouth cramped up without daring to say a single thing. He did not dare to say a thing as he stood up pitifully with his head lowered. The rest of their faces were also completely pale\u2026</p><br/><p>A short while later a couple of figures were punished to stand outside in the snow with their heads lowered. According to young noble Ling\u2019s original words, their laughter was too loud and assassins should know how to maintain their cool. Thus, they need to cool down in the snow before copying a thousand-word essay a hundred times\u2026</p><br/><p>The few of them wanted to cry but had no tears. Why were they so unlucky? It was one thing to stand in the snow but copying a thousand-word essay a hundred times\u2026 that was 100,000 words!</p><br/><p>Their tears began rolling down the corners of their eyes and onto the ground!</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a single person in the room who dared to plead for mercy!</p><br/><p>******</p><br/><p>At this moment, Li Xue\u2019s room was filled with laughter and chattering. In the room, everyone present was a unique beauty and were all like fairies. They were the beauties who young noble Ling was unable to find. All of them were gathered together in the circle being filled with laughter.</p><br/><p>On the table, there were ten different snacks and a few jugs of wine. Mmm, the wine was the \u2018Maiden\u2019s Heart\u2019 which Ling Tian treasured the most. However, a full five jugs had appeared in this room!</p><br/><p>The window was open and the snow drifted into the room. At the same time, there were three peach blossoms swaying in the wind.</p><br/><p>In actual fact, the reason for all of their disappearance was extremely simple. They were gathering together to enjoy the snow and blossoms. Who could be bothered about young noble Ling?!</p><br/><p>The faces of the five beauties were pinkish and they had obviously drunk a fair bit of wine. Occasionally, a joke from one of them would cause the five of them to burst out into laughter. Their arms were hanging on each other\u2019s shoulders and they looked extremely lazy. None of them had the disposition of a little princess, well-mannered lady, or chivalrous expert!</p><br/><p>If Ling Tian was present and witnessed this scene, he would probably turn into a wolf on the spot\u2026</p><br/><p>Her rosy red lips took a sip of wine and even Li Xue who was supposed to be sober seemed a little drunk, \u201c\u2026when that little boy was bathing, his clothes were all stolen by someone. He did not even have a cloth to cover himself and could only squat in the water naked. Looking around, he used his hands to cover his\u2026\u201d Li Xue stood up and demonstrated the action.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d The ladies burst out laughing together and Xiao YanXue spat out a mouthful of wine.</p><br/><p>If Ling Tian was present, he would definitely be angered to the point he vomited blood. The little boy which Li Xue was describing was Ling Tian who was pranked by her in their previous life! It was also no wonder why the lass could remember the details so clearly as she animated every single scene.</p><br/><p>At the very end, the few ladies laughed to the point their sides ached and the story ended.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou laughed as she asked, \u201cThe little boy in sister Xue\u2019s story seems to have left a deep impression on sister Xue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue was already pretty drunk and replied without thinking, \u201cNonsense, of course he left a deep impression on me. Isn\u2019t he\u2026\u201d As she said that, she suddenly regained clarity and stopped.</p><br/><p>Looking at the other ladies awkwardly, she laughed dryly, \u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this. Come, everyone drink.\u201d She then lifted up her glass to propose a toast.</p><br/><p>All of the ladies present were extremely sharp individuals and immediately looked at Li Xue with a profound gaze. After letting out a long \u2018ohhhh\u2019, they said in unison, \u201cThat little brat must be sister Xue\u2019s lover right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue was immediately reduced to a pathetic state as she scolded, \u201cHow could he be?! All of you little scoundrels, all of you only know how to think in such a crooked manner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen frowned in thought, \u201cHow can he be sister Xue\u2019s lover? All of you may not know but I am extremely certain that sister Xue\u2019s lover is young noble. However, young noble grew up with Chen\u2019er and the little boy in the story would never be young noble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen who is the little boy?\u201d The few of them began guessing.</p><br/><p>For some reason, Ling Tian\u2019s figure drifted in Ling Chen\u2019s head and she recalled Ling Tian\u2019s lonely gaze\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s body shook as she gasped in disbelief, \u201cCould sister Xue be talking about young noble? But\u2026\u201d As her words left her mouth, all of the ladies had the same thought and they looked at Li Xue with doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could it be possible?\u201d Li Xue forced a smile, \u201cYounger sister Chen has already said that Tian\u2019ge accompanied her when he was young. I did not have the fortune to meet him then.\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

After the arrival of the Shui Family experts in Sky Bearing, they would have major or minor conflicts with the local powers almost every day. In fact, they also had a number of confrontations with the Yu Family as well. In such an important period, Ling Chen disappeared completely and refused to see anyone!</p><br/><p>Why would her sister who paid her frequent visits in the past disappear suddenly? This made the already anxious Shui QianRou bite her lips to the point blisters could be seen.</p><br/><p>Just what should I do? The battle with the Yu Family is right in front of my very eyes and if we do not have the support of the Ling Family at this moment, wouldn\u2019t we as guests be eaten alive by the Yu Family? After all, they were flying blind in the Heavenly Star Continent and if they were to meet a true crisis, they wouldn\u2019t even know which direction to flee.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Shui QianRou\u2019s cousins would use every method up their sleeves to seek trouble with Shui QianHuan, and the past few miserable days were like years to Shui QianRou. While Ling Chen did send a Ling Chi as reinforcement for them, it was no different from paying her lip service. The only thing Ling Chi would do would be to ensure that no harm came to Shui QianHuan. However, the vicious remarks, despicable teasing, and endless mocking would not stop. Shui QianJiang and his brothers weren\u2019t fools either. Even if Shui QianHuan made a grave mistake, he was still the only son of the present Family Head and they would not dare to harm him directly. However, mocking him from the side definitely didn\u2019t count as harm. The three brothers took turns to tease and mock Shui QianHuan, humiliating him in every way possible. This made the already injured Shui QianHuan suffer a huge mental blow, and his unrecovered injuries worsened even further. Shui QianHuan ended up puking blood for many days in a row and was skinny like a branch with his life on the line\u2026</p><br/><p>Before she received instructions from Ling Chen, Shui QianRou would definitely not dare to take her Shui Family members to find Ling Chen hastily. She would pay a visit to the Ling Family Courtyard every day alone but not to mention Ling Chen, she could not even see Li Xue. The person who would accompany her every day was her fated rival and newly sworn sister, Yu BingYan!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou felt like she was going crazy!</p><br/><p>If Ling Chen did not appear soon, her own brother would probably be angered, humiliated and trampled to death by her cousins\u2026</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the recent actions of the Yu Family were also extremely odd. It was as though they were trying to prepare for something. They were very obviously trying to accumulate wealth as though they wanted to swallow whatever they could before pulling out\u2026 With an important part of the Yu Family members being present in Sky Bearing, together with the fact that both her Shui and the Yu Family weren\u2019t in their own territory, this was the best time for their Shui Family to weaken the Yu Family. How would Shui QianRou be willing to let go of such an opportunity?</p><br/><p>But without Ling Chen making an appearance, Shui QianRou did not dare to make a decision on her own. As for the few Shui Family elders, they would naturally not be able to suppress the Yu Family who were the natives to Heavenly Star. In order to be safe, all the elders agreed to wait a moment before making a decision\u2026 However, if they were to continue waiting, the already roasted duck would probably fly away\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the eleventh time Shui QianRou entered the Ling Family Courtyard!</p><br/><p>It was also the eleventh day of the Shui Family experts entering Sky Bearing!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou held onto a glass of tea and sat on the chair in a complete daze and at a loss. Ever since she was born, when had she felt this way before? She asked herself over and over again if something went wrong. She could not understand why Ling Chen did not want to see her. Could it be that Ling Chen was dissatisfied at her Shui Family\u2019s misinformation about the number of troops coming to Heavenly Star? Could it be that Shui QianRou was enraged at her cousins\u2019 attitudes? Regardless of the reason, it didn\u2019t seem good for their Shui Family.</p><br/><p>Being in a state of anxiousness and panic, regardless of what Yu BingYan said, Shui QianRou did not hear a single word and only gave perfunctory replies.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan was originally trying her best to create a conversation after seeing Shui QianRou\u2019s troubled appearance, but hearing her perfunctory replies she let out a bitter laugh and decided to shut her mouth. The two of them then sat in the room staring at each other to the point their eyes widened. Or perhaps, it would be more accurate to say that Yu BingYan looked at Shui QianRou who was in a daze. As for Shui QianRou, she did not even know what she was thinking about anymore\u2026</p><br/><p>Outside the door, barely audible footsteps could be heard, and Ling Chen\u2019s apologetic voice sounded, \u201cI really have to apologize to younger sister Rou. There were just too many things that happened in the past few days. After making a trip out of the Courtyard, I suffered some injuries and that resulted in the delay of a few days. I am really sorry! Younger sister Rou must be anxious from waiting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou stood up immediately as though she had just heard an imperial decree and replied with a smile, \u201cIt\u2019s alright, the most important thing is that elder sister is back safely.\u201d As she raised her head up, she could not help but be shocked.</p><br/><p>While Ling Chen looked like she was healthy and energetic, Shui QianRou could tell that Ling Chen was far skinnier than she was ten days ago! Her cheeks were slim to the point her cheekbones could be seen. Her eyes also seemed to be slightly larger with the veins being faintly visible. Her originally frail appearance looked even more pitiful at the moment and she looked as though she could be blown away by a light gust of wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister, what\u2026. what happened?\u201d She originally suspected that Ling Chen was only giving her an excuse to shut her up but upon seeing Ling Chen\u2019s appearance, Shui QianRou no longer had the heart to feign courtesy. She felt her heart ache and shot towards Ling Chen\u2019s side and asked with concern all over her face, \u201cWhat happened exactly? Why would you lose so much weight?\u201d She then suddenly felt her heart sink as she thought, Could it be\u2026 that something happened to him? Thinking about that, she felt a sharp pain in her chest as though it was being hammered down with a large hammer. Her face turned pale as she took two steps back and her eyes seemed to have lost all color.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it is fine already.\u201d Ling Chen said with a smile, \u201cThere was something that happened that required my personal attention. On the way back, I met with an assassination attempt by the absolute elites of the NanGong Family, and I almost didn\u2019t manage to make it back. However, I have delayed younger sister\u2019s affairs, and I hope that younger sister wouldn\u2019t blame me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026\u201d Shui QianRou felt a load off her shoulders before saying with self-blame, \u201cSince elder sister is injured, why aren\u2019t you taking good care of yourself? This younger sister\u2019s presence has disturbed elder sister\u2019s resting time and this younger sister should be the one in the wrong.\u201d Looking at Ling Chen who was in front of her, Shui QianRou could vaguely feel that while Ling Chen was still the same Ling Chen who she was familiar with, Ling Chen seemed to have an additional charisma but yet seemed to be lacking something as well. It was as though Ling Chen underwent a huge transformation over the past few days and Shui QianRou could not help but feel the Ling Chen in front of her to be extremely foreign\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Ling Chen smiled warmly and sat down, \u201cFor younger sister to come here today, there should be something important right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou smiled bitterly and a frustrated look could be seen on her face, \u201cShui QianJian and the others have gone too far. These few days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen replied with doubt, \u201cDidn\u2019t I send Ling Chi over? Why? They actually don\u2019t want to give my Ling Family face? They really dare to make things difficult for your brother?!\u201d As Ling Chen\u2019s tone changed, an eerie feeling also emanated out from Ling Chen and a tinge of bloodiness could be felt.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou felt difficulty breathing all of a sudden and forced herself to take two deep breaths before continuing with a forced smile, \u201cWhat is elder sister talking about? My Shui Family naturally has to be extremely respectful to the Ling Family when we are in Sky Bearing. However, their words are truly nasty and with my brother\u2019s arrogance and his unrecovered wounds, his injuries have inevitably been influenced by their words.\u201d Shui QianRou could not help but gasp in shock internally. In just a short few days of not seeing Ling Chen, while Ling Chen\u2019s actions and words weren\u2019t any different, her aura had completely transformed! Just the eerie and bloody aura being emanated previously was something that even a soldier who had been through many battles wouldn\u2019t be able to match! It was truly frightening!</p><br/><p>Ling Chen replied with an \u2018oh\u2019 before smiling again, \u201cA precious sword has to be sharpened and the blossoms need to endure the harsh winter. I believe that after this incident, young master Shui would definitely have a deeper understanding of all matters and it isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou laughed bitterly in her heart, Even if it is a good thing for him, he has to first pull himself through this event. Looking at how Brother is acting, he probably won\u2019t be able to last for long\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, Family Head Yu ManLou suddenly took in a concubine three days ago and the Yu Family army seems to be congregating as though something huge is about to happen.\u201d Shui QianRou said worriedly, \u201cAt the same time, the members in the Yu Family stationed in Sky Bearing seemed to have received some news and are all packing up their luggage and amassing as much wealth as they can. They look as though they are going to make an immediate retreat and if we drag matters for too long, I am afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan stood up hastily and her face turned ugly. Her tone then suddenly turned distant as she said hoarsely, \u201cI am feeling unwell and will return to the secret chamber first.\u201d She then turned around and left.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou felt her face burning in embarrassment and realized that Yu BingYan was the princess of the Yu Family. To think that she would discuss with Ling Chen about their plans to deal with the Yu Family right in front of her\u2026 Am I out of my mind? Why didn\u2019t I think of that?</p><br/><p>With Shui QianRou\u2019s intellect and upbringing, it was impossible for her to forget about such an important point. However, she was far too troubled over the past few days with her intestines twisting up from worry and thus overlooked the matter. Besides that, it was also because Shui QianRou truly treated Yu BingYan as her own sister and did not guard against her at all. Thus, such a scene unfolded today.</p><br/><p>It was also extremely strange. After Yu BingYan and Shui QianRou became sworn sisters, the relationship between these two individuals who were fated to be life or death rivals was actually the closest. They were far closer to each other than to Ling Chen who was the one who initiated to become sworn sisters. It was as though the two of them did not consider the identity of the other party and this was something that made both Ling Chen and Li Xue astounded. Now that Shui QianRou spelled out her worries without any wariness in front of Yu BingYan, it was because she truly didn\u2019t guard against Yu BingYan in the slightest bit. Even Shui QianRou herself didn\u2019t know when such a huge change occurred in her heart and it was truly unfathomable.</p><br/><p>This was something that both Shui QianRou and Yu BingYan were extremely clear about. However, Yu BingYan was still sandwiched in the middle and was stuck in a dilemma. Especially when she heard about the news of Yu ManLou accepting a concubine. The three ladies were completely flabbergasted, and Yu BingYan had the urge to dig a hole to bury her head underground.</p><br/><p>Only Ling Chen and Shui QianRou were left in the room and after a long while of facing each other, Ling Chen suddenly began giggling before pointing at the awkward Shui QianRou, \u201cHahaha\u2026 truly a fated pair of sisters!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou opened her mouth awkwardly, but not a word came out. She then let out a sigh which was filled with both bitterness and joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith regards to the Yu Family, I was already informed about it. However, there have been some recent changes, and it wouldn\u2019t be convenient for my Ling Family to make an appearance. We are after all the in-laws of the Yu Family. Even if we are eager to accomplish something, we cannot change that fact!\u201d Ling Chen said slowly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSome recent changes? In-laws? Is your Ling Family going to make peace with the Yu Family?\u201d Shui QianRou asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen went silent for a moment as she thought about the newest piece of news that her young noble sent. She then replied in a vague manner, \u201cWe are still sisters after all and I do not want to hide anything from you. The young noble sent news that with regards to the Yu Family, our Ling Family can only aid you in the dark but not aid any of you openly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou let out an \u2018oh\u2019 and relaxed. As long as the Ling Family does not join hands with the Yu Family, it wouldn\u2019t matter whether or not the Ling Family work in the dark or light. This wouldn\u2019t affect their alliance and the present situation wouldn\u2019t change.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen muttered under her breath for a moment before suddenly saying, \u201cAccording to my estimates, the Yu Family will be pulling out from Sky Bearing over the next few days. The opportunity that all of you have been waiting for may arrive very soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s eyes lit up and she said, \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen blinked her eyes and said with a smile, \u201cI have already sent orders for my men to not stop the Yu Family from taking whatever they wanted. Thus\u2026 the Yu Family\u2019s troops would definitely be extremely huge and slow\u2026 ah ah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister you are too naughty!\u201d Shui QianRou laughed and immediately became energetic, \u201cUsing such a method to slow them down and reduce their strength considerably\u2026 what a brilliant plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>A smile could be seen on Ling Chen\u2019s face as she said, \u201cA human\u2019s selfishness and greed is endless. Especially these little subordinates of the Yu Family. While gold and silver may be no different from ordinary rocks in Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes, to ordinary experts of the Yu Family, it is their basis of survival. Thus, even if Yu ManLou issued an order, these men will only leave when their pockets are full.\u201d Ling Chen turned around and said with a tinge of mockery, \u201cThe moment greed and selfishness blind their eyes, our opportunity will arrive. The moment they leave Sky Bearing will also be the moment that heavenly lightning will descend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s breathing turned heavy and her eyes shone brightly, \u201cOur Shui Family members would definitely intercept their troops along the way to return a favor to the Yu Family members. We have to repay them for the debt of obstructing me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen looked at Shui QianRou and said, \u201cWe will provide you with detailed information of the Yu Family\u2019s route and the most accurate information! We will even include the martial skills that the leaders of the Yu Family specialize in, their combat strength, how much jewelry they are carrying and all other factors that may affect their combat strength. It would definitely not miss out a single point. However, we are unable to participate in this ambush and every single detail of the attack shall be planned fully by you. We will not interfere in the matter at all. Is there a problem?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem at all!\u201d Shui QianRou said brimming with confidence, \u201cIf we are still unable to give the Yu Family a huge blow despite our advantage, we do not deserve to share the same reputation as the Yu Family!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

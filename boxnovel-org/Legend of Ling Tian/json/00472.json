This old man was in my prime forty years ago and roamed the pugilistic world for decades, so why have I never heard of that name? Who in the world would dare to have such a nickname?!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then glared at Ling Tian with rage, \u201cBrat, just who are you? You actually dare to come and play a fool in Bright Jade City? How bold! Apprehend him! If he dares to resist, kill him without mercy!\u201d The final part of his sentence was an order given out to the Yu Family experts.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompassion is in my heart and killing is sinful. I didn\u2019t want to engage in killing, but all of you want to force my hand!\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s old voice sounded, \u201cForget it, why is there a need to talk to all of you juniors? This old man shall take my leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then turned around heavily like an old general who spent his life in the battlefield being forced to leave the battlefield, with his heroic career ending in loneliness and desolation. Anyone who saw this heavy figure of Ling Tian\u2019s would definitely feel their hearts turn heavy.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had already made a decision in his heart. If all else fails, he would have to take personal action to lead the Yu Family experts over.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop him!\u201d The Head Deacon roared.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 old senior Qin\u2026\u201d that White Jade expert was still in a daze.</p><br/><p>\u201cPa!\u201d A crisp slapping sound could be heard and the Head Deacon was enraged to the point he trembled, \u201cPig head! What old senior Qin? He is no more than a spy! Why can\u2019t you have some brains? If he was truly a friend of the Yu Family, would he come in the night sneakily without daring to show his true appearance? Darn b*st*rd!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who block me will die!\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s voice changed and was filled with boundless killing intent. His advancing figure suddenly stopped and he made an action. His hand came out from his sleeves and after circulating his Divine Shocking Dragon Formula, it turned into a pure Yang cultivation formula. All of a sudden, his palms seem to be giving out a strange glow which gradually grew brighter and brighter like a miniature sun in the darkness.</p><br/><p>Everyone stopped in shock. Just what kind of a martial art is this?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian raised his hand up into the sky and with a swing of his arm, the fireball was shot out and a huge hole was blasted in a gigantic tree 30 feet away. Following that, black smoke could be seen coming out from it and it burst out into bright flames but shockingly remained standing.</p><br/><p>He was actually able to send out fire from his palms! Not to mention seeing it before, none of them had even heard about such an ability!</p><br/><p>What shocking martial arts!</p><br/><p>The Head Deacon felt his face cramp up and a look of disbelief could be seen in his eyes. If one\u2019s own martial arts achieved an extremely profound depth, one would naturally be able to create fire by touching wood. This was something that the Head Deacon knew as a martial arts expert. Besides that, he himself would be able to set dry wood on fire if he touched the wood with his palms. However, which expert in the world would be able to set a tree on fire with a palm strike from 30 feet away?</p><br/><p>This impossible miracle had happened right before his very eyes!</p><br/><p>Even the publicly acknowledged number one expert in the world probably wouldn\u2019t be able to perform such a feat! However, this black-masked man in front of him was able to light up the tree with a flip of his palms. Furthermore, as the Head Deacon thought about the glowing ball of light on the black-masked man\u2019s palm, he couldn\u2019t help but be filled with unease. Could this black-masked man truly be a hidden martial arts expert?</p><br/><p>If this black-masked man was truly an expert who secluded himself from the world, regardless of whether or not he knew their old Family Head, it was definitely not wise for them to offend him. Thus, the Head Deacon was rooted to the spot and didn\u2019t know what he should do.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian lowered his palm down and the few thunderbeads had been kept back into his embrace. This was something which Ling Tian had extorted from Li Xue. This lass had specially created the Tang Sect\u2019s thunderbeads and in his world where gunpowder had not been discovered yet, no one would even imagine that firearms such as thunderbeads would exist. Thus, the Head Deacon of the Yu Family would suspect that he is an otherworldly martial arts expert. However, Ling Tian was extremely dissatisfied with the invention of the gunpowder. While it was a great mark of the progress of human civilization, it had also caused a frightening calamity to the human race.</p><br/><p>If this world had gunpowder as well, it would definitely be like his previous life, where more and more destructive weapons were created one after another, causing a greater number of casualties in wars.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was never an individual who would be concerned about the wellbeing of the commoners. He would make use of the knowledge and experience from his previous life to ensure that he could enjoy the largest number of benefits. However, this gunpowder that every transmigrator would create was something that he strictly prohibited. As long as gunpowder appears, the technological advancement of gunpowder would take place in a short few decades. At that time, the world would definitely shift towards feudalism and slavery, leaving no way out for the commoners.</p><br/><p>There were still swordsmen who would roam the pugilistic world to get rid of evil right now but when gunpowder or cannons are developed, an ordinary individual who has not trained in martial arts before would be able to kill an expert like Justice under certain conditions. Furthermore, gunpowder would definitely end up in the hands of those with authority.</p><br/><p>At that time, what would be the point of bitterly training in martial arts for decades? From a certain viewpoint, Ling Tian absolutely hated the invention of gunpowder. If not for gunpowder making the Chinese feel that martial arts were useless, how would a China filled with experts ever suffer from the Eight-Nation Alliance humiliation? How would the darn Japanese be able to invade their nation for a full eight years? The decline of martial arts and the rise of gunpowder had caused millions of their Chinese comrades endless suffering!</p><br/><p>While not all of these were caused by gunpowder, and it was also because of corrupt officials and incapable politicians, it was undeniable that gunpowder had caused Chinese martial arts to wane over the years.</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Tian had decided. Even if gunpowder would eventually be invented in this world, it must not come from his hands. Since he was in this world, he should at least keep to the rules of this world and respect the effort that thousands of years of experts had put into the refinement of their martial arts!</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Tian had very seriously warned Li Xue to not create anymore thunderbeads or any gunpowder related weapons. Mmm, if she were to accidentally make a batch in future, only Li Xue and Ling Chen would be allowed to use it. No one else would be allowed to use it or even come into contact with it. Because of this, Li Xue had looked at Ling Tian at disdain and cursed that he was trying to act so angelic despite trying to fight a war of hegemony. The outcome: Ling Tian spanking Li Xue in a fit of rage.</p><br/><p>However, taking the gunpowder out at this moment was truly effective in scaring the Yu Family experts.</p><br/><p>Looking at the nervous Yu Family experts in front of him, Ling Tian put on the demeanor of an otherworldly expert and said with pity, \u201cIt is best for all of you to not follow me. This old man truly does not want to kill anyone from the Yu Family.\u201d At the same time, he thought to himself hatefully, While this daddy here really wants to kill all of you guys from the Yu Family, I can\u2019t do that now!</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that Sir will give our Yu Family some face when you are in the city. At the very least, please give the late old Family Head some face. If not, even if we know that we aren\u2019t a match for Sir, we will have no choice but to fulfill our responsibilities.\u201d After witnessing the heaven defying martial arts of the \u2018senior\u2019 in front of them, the Head Deacon gave in. Even if he had some doubts about the status of the person in front of him, his attitude took a huge turn.</p><br/><p>Even if he knew that the other party was lying to him about being a friend of his Old Family Head, it was best to just play along with the other party. After all, Bright Jade City was currently in a mess and if they were to provoke this expert in front of them, the consequences would be unimaginable! Offending such an expert would spell endless troubles for their Yu Family!</p><br/><p>\u201cEn? That old man TianShan has passed on already?! This old man feels that I can stay alive for a few more years. Why did he go onto the next life first?\u201d Ling Tian lamented.</p><br/><p>The Head Deacon replied respectfully, \u201cIf Sir a friend of our Old Family Head, you are naturally someone who has great fate with our Yu Family. Since you are here in Bright Jade City, allow us to play the part of a proper host!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian didn\u2019t give a reply and his figure drifted into the air like a feather in the wind. Only when he was in midair did his voice travel over, \u201cWhat kind of fate do I have with you guys? Since Yu TianShan is no longer around, this old man has no more friends in Bright Jade City. If you want this old man to give your Yu Family some face, your Yu Family will have to show this old man some face first!\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s voice resounded in the ears of the Yu Family experts but his figure had disappeared from their sights.</p><br/><p>The Head Deacon looked at the direction where Ling Tian disappeared towards as he lamented over Ling Tian\u2019s unbelievable palm strike. To think that such frightening martial arts would actually exist in the world! He then turned around and asked, \u201cLi Gang, who did you say he was?\u201d Li Gang was the White Jade expert in the lead.</p><br/><p>Li Gang hurriedly took a step forward and said respectfully, \u201cThis old senior Qin did indeed say that he was a friend of the old Family Head. His nickname is even more shocking: \u2018Immortal-like, deity-like, devil-like, unprecedented expert who grasped the three islands, five mountains, and everything in all directions\u2019. This subordinate does not know if it is true or false.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Head Deacon responded with an \u2018Mmm\u2019 before saying seriously, \u201cHe is truly an otherworldly expert and it is best for us to not become enemies with him. Continue your patrols and this old man will go back to the Yu Residence. An expert suddenly appearing in the city is something that I must report to the Family Head immediately.\u201d As he said that, he was about to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHead Deacon,\u201d an old man who followed the Head Deacon hurriedly called out, \u201cIf Head Deacon is going back to the Yu Residence, should our plan tonight\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Head Deacon pondered for a moment before replying, \u201cHow can we ignore second young noble\u2019s detailed plan? Delay the plan for two hours and this old man will be back soon.\u201d With a flash, his figure had appeared in front of the previously burning tree and after staring at it for awhile, he disappeared into the night sky.</p><br/><p>After traveling a short distance, Ling Tian looked behind and there was indeed no one following behind him. He couldn\u2019t help but let out a delighted smile as he thought, I wonder how Yu ManLou will react to this matter? I wonder if this identity that I spontaneously created will be of any use? Or perhaps I can use it further\u2026</p><br/><p>After deliberating for a moment, Ling Tian took off his black mask and retrieved a human mask from his bosom. After putting it on, he flew towards the direction of third young noble Yu\u2019s courtyard.</p><br/><p>The Yu Family.</p><br/><p>\u201cQin ShiHuang?\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s brows were furrowed and his eyes were in deep thought. After a long while, he shook his head, \u201cOld Family Head\u2019s friend? Furthermore, his martial arts have achieved such a height? This old man has not heard of someone like this in the world. Could it be a fake name?\u201d</p><br/><p>As though he was reminded by Yu ManLou, the Head Deacon slapped his thighs, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Family Head\u2019s vision is truly sharp. This old man had racked my brains just now but was unable to come up with anything. Family Head is brilliant indeed. Ah ah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou looked at the Head Deacon with a smile and was seemingly unmoved by his flattery. However, this glance from the Family Head made the Head Deacon\u2019s face burn in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou paced around and asked, \u201cBurning wood with his inner qi from thirty feet away. Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t dry wood but fresh living wood. Head Deacon, with your understanding of martial arts, just what kind of heights must one achieve in order to perform such a feat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of heights?\u201d The Head Deacon frowned and said with difficulty, \u201cAccording to what this old man knows, there isn\u2019t a martial arts realm capable of performing such a feat. Perhaps this old man is ignorant and has never heard of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnorant?\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s voice was slightly chilly, \u201cHead Deacon has studied martial arts for plenty of years and has studied countless cultivation techniques in the world. You entered the Deacon\u2019s Hall ten years ago and have studied those martial arts that exist in the legends. I believe that even Beyond Heavens wouldn\u2019t have a larger martial arts collection than our Yu Family. If Head Deacon is ignorant, then there wouldn\u2019t be anyone worthy of calling themselves knowledgeable in martial arts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou turned around and placed his hands behind his back as a smile surfaced onto his lips, \u201cI wonder if Head Deacon has thought of the matter from this angle: if this person is truly able to light up a tree from 30 feet away, he would probably be considered an immortal and far superior to the Martial Order Medallion owner, Justice. How would it be possible for such a heaven-shaking figure to be completely unheard of in the world? Doesn\u2019t Head Deacon find this matter strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps he has appeared before but used another name? Or perhaps\u2026\u201d The Head Deacon\u2019s voice became softer as he understood what Yu ManLou meant. Regardless of what his identity was, such a character would definitely be world famous. As long as he had previously appeared in the world, even if he did not leave behind his name, he should still be remembered by the world.</p><br/><p>However, there had never been such a figure who appeared in the past thousand years. What did this mean?</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou smiled and came to a conclusion, \u201cThus, this person must definitely be someone we know who is trying to play us like a fool. As for burning the tree from 30 feet away, while it seems like an impossible feat, it would be achievable if he made some tricks on the tree beforehand. There isn\u2019t anything impossible in the world. I would never believe that someone would be able to achieve such martial arts height in the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou paused for a moment and looked at the Head Deacon, \u201cThe truth is that you were most likely tricked!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Head Deacon\u2019s drying up old face has suddenly turned as red as a baboon\u2019s behind! A ball of fury burned in his heart! He had roamed unhindered in the pugilistic world for decades and was actually tricked by someone in his old age. He was completely ashamed and wanted to find a hole to hide in. He was not a foolish individual and after hearing what Yu ManLou had said as well as the depth of his martial arts knowledge, he realized that it was truly something unrealistic!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this person isn\u2019t Ling Tian, he should be someone from Above Heavens. I think that the former is more likely.\u201d Yu ManLou said with a smile and analyzed, \u201cIn any case, he will not be Justice and Beyond Heavens wouldn\u2019t play such a trick. It is very likely that he isn\u2019t too old either, and that\u2019s why I think that it is more likely to be Ling Tian.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat little animal Ling Tian! If this old man catches him, I will definitely rip him to shreds!\u201d The Head Deacon clenched his teeth and puffed angrily. After rushing back to make a report to Yu ManLou, he had not only missed the best time for the plan but was also completely played like a fool. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. Thinking about the actions and bearing of the other party, the Head Deacon also felt that Yu ManLou\u2019s conjecture must definitely be accurate.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t rush this matter.\u201d Yu ManLou shook his head, \u201cSince Ling Tian has the courage to appear, he would have definitely made preparations and will definitely have a follow-up action. Perhaps he does not have any goals besides putting on such a play and only did it in a fit of excitement. Or perhaps he was afraid of us messing up his plans and thus making such a risky move as a stop-gap measure. Regardless of what it is, his gamble has paid off.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head is trying to say that Ling Tian will definitely take action tonight?\u201d The Head Deacon asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! Not only will he take action, but his action won\u2019t be a small one for sure.\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes gleamed, \u201cWhen facing this teen, you must not be careless. You can return first and monitor the entire city. This old man will immediately gather all the subdivision heads and order them to join you. Tonight, this old man will definitely make Ling Tian become a victim of his own smartness! Taking a risk and leaving things up to luck will never amount to great things!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Family Head.\u201d The Head Deacon acknowledged and wanted to walk out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Yu ManLou waved his hands, \u201cIf Ling Tian appears with the status of this Qin ShiHuang again, you should pretend to believe him and stall for time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Head Deacon felt startled as he thought, With his goal accomplished, why would he use this status again? However, he didn\u2019t dare to rebut Yu ManLou\u2019s words and left after acknowledging that order.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou looked out towards the night sky and muttered to himself with delight, \u201cLing Tian is probably feeling extremely delighted over being able to scare the Head Deacon with this little trick of his. Since he is feeling delighted, how would he not use this status to show off his prestige again? Regardless of how wise he is, he is still a fifteen-year-old teen!\u201d With a sneer, Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes turned cold and filled with killing intent, \u201cA young man is just too tender!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then walked towards the door and shouted, \u201cMen! Gather all the subdivision heads to meet me now! There must be no delay!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>There were still a few lamps being lit in Yu LiuShui\u2019s courtyard and someone was still awake.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was dressed in black and hidden in the vegetation. His eyes were fixed on the light spilling out of the window and a dense killing intent filled his heart.</p><br/><p>Above Heavens, since you guys want to take my life, I will give all of you an unforgettable lesson! As the moon climbed up into the sky, Ling Tian estimated the time in his heart. Yu LiuShui\u2019s action is probably starting soon, right?</p><br/><p>The night sky was filled with drifting clouds and wasn\u2019t cloudless like last night. Thus, this was also the time when the night was the darkest and the best time for the \u2018nightwalkers\u2019 to appear.</p><br/><p>Painful groans could be heard coming out from the window and while it was extremely soft, it spread out far in the silent light. It was as though someone was trying to bear with an extreme amount of pain.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s eyes were shut lightly as he leaned on the tree branch and enjoyed the night breeze. As the branch swayed slightly in the winds, Ling Tian looked extremely carefree and didn\u2019t have a trace of anxiousness. If was as though he was playing on a swing and looked extremely contented.</p><br/><p>From afar, a few \u2018sou sou\u2019 sounds could be heard and there were many nightwalkers approaching his location. Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curved up slightly but he remained stationary.</p><br/><p>The sounds of figures breaking through the air stopped from afar and more than forty Yu Family experts appeared in Ling Tian\u2019s divine sense, forming a circle and slowly surrounding this area.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian praised in his heart. This Head Deacon\u2019s commands are truly commendable. Knowing that he would alert the enemy if he were to openly approach the courtyard, he slowly formed an encirclement. While it was slower, it was the most effective method.</p><br/><p>The one closest to Ling Tian\u2019s hiding spot was now no less than 500 feet away and the one furthest away was about 700 feet away. The time is about right. Ling Tian began to count down in his heart, \u201cThree, two, one\u2026\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s figure then slid down from the tree branch and his figure appeared in front of the wall of the courtyard without a sound. Circulating his inner qi, Ling Tian flipped over the wall nimbly without even a change in the shadows of the surroundings.</p><br/><p>Everything happened silently, and Ling Tian was like a ghost entering the courtyard without moving a single blade of grass or leaf.</p><br/><p>The painful groans still sounded from the room with the lamp lit and at this moment, a cloud drifted past and covered the moon. The surroundings immediately turned dark and Ling Tian had made use of this momentary darkness to cover 60 feet of distance, sticking himself below the window of the room like a lizard.</p><br/><p>Raising his right hand up, a black short blade gleamed in his hand. Listening carefully, there didn\u2019t seem to be any other sounds apart from the painful groans of the person bearing with pain. Ling Tian no longer hesitated and with a swing of his blade, the window was slid open. After Ling Tian flipped into the room and entered the building, the room fell completely silent.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

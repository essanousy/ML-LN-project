YOU?!\u201d Xiao YanXue gasped with her hands covering her mouth and a look of incredulity. Following that, the gossiping nature of a lady erupted\u2026 after all, this was the gossip of the Yu Family Head\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry hurry hurry hurry\u2026 tell me, what happened? How did you egg him on?! Amazing! Hehehe, I think that you can become a matchmaker.\u201d Xiao YanXue\u2019s breathing became ragged as she grabbed onto Ling Tian\u2019s arm and shook it vigorously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt happened like this\u2026\u201d Ling Tian said with conceit. After all, not anyone in the world would be able to render Yu ManLou speechless with pent-up grievances. He then began to slowly illustrate what had happened.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue burst out laughing and her eyes were narrowed to the point they formed a slit.</p><br/><p>However, she suddenly stopped laughing at the very end and her expression also grew serious. She then looked at Ling Tian with a solemn expression and said coldly, \u201cAre you very delighted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 err\u2026\u201d Ling Tian said awkwardly as he looked at Xiao YanXue while wondering what was up with her again. Why would there be such a drastic change in her expression in such a short instant? No wonder there was a saying: A woman\u2019s heart; needle in the ocean. Just the way her expression changed so rapidly was something that an ordinary person wouldn\u2019t be able to bear.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian lamented in his heart, Women! Women! A species that just cannot be understood!</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue was both angered and anxious as she tapped on Ling Tian\u2019s forehead lightly, \u201cHaiz, you were wise for a lifetime but foolish for an instant.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian suddenly felt that something was definitely wrong and grew solemn as well. \u201cCan I seek your teachings?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaiz.\u201d Xiao YanXue let out a sigh, \u201cIf you were Yu ManLou and the son with the brightest future had passed away with only two wastrels left behind, how would you feel? The three miseries of life: death of parents when young, death of spouse during the middle-aged days, and death of son when old. Yu ManLou can already be considered to be an old man and such a blow was something that not many people would be able to endure! Even if Yu ManLou had great control over his emotions, his state of mind would definitely be affected because he could no longer see any hope.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrue.\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s face grew ugly. It seems like he had unknowingly made a huge mistake! He had given his biggest opponent a glimmer of hope!</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrently, the most important thing to a person like Yu ManLou isn\u2019t the extension of his life but for his family lineage to carry on.\u201d Xiao YanXue said hatefully, \u201cYu ManLou originally did not have any thoughts about that and only wanted to live the last segment of his life with brilliance. He originally did not have any hope for the younger generation of the Yu Family but you actually gave him such a huge hope at this period! You reminded him that he can have another child\u2026\u201d Xiao YanXue\u2019s face blushed slightly and she continued, \u201cWith Yu ManLou\u2019s status and age, he would not have thought of that for sure. However, you in an attempt to give him a blow, you gave him a huge reminder!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis reminder of yours helped him to walk out of the trap he would have never walked out of. Furthermore, he will be filled with even greater fighting spirit to gain hegemony over the continent. You gave him a new hope and target while filling up his originally fatigued heart again. This opponent that was already difficult to deal with will become even more troublesome! As long as someone has a change in the state of his mind, there would definitely be a huge chain effect!\u201d Xiao YanXue glared at Ling Tian angrily, \u201cAnd you are still feeling delighted over your actions!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue was indeed a genius who was able to deduce such frightening consequences from Ling Tian\u2019s short description! At the same time, Xiao YanXue could not help but grow anxious. The stronger Yu ManLou was, the more Ling Tian and her Xiao Family would be in danger. It was impossible for Xiao YanXue to let go of these two families!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was visibly impacted and he let out a sigh, \u201cThat\u2019s right, it was my mistake indeed. A grave mistake!\u201d From the moment he told Yu ManLou those words, he could vaguely sense that something was wrong. However, he just didn\u2019t know what was wrong. After Xiao YanXue broke down the matter for him in such detail, he truly realized his mistake! Furthermore, such a grave mistake!</p><br/><p>The considerations of a wise man would definitely miss something.</p><br/><p>However, even if he realized his mistake, it was far too late already. Yu ManLou was already like a reborn phoenix under his provocation and walked out of hopelessness. While there was a trace of regret in his heart, Ling Tian was filled with more craziness and excitement!</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Tian admit his mistake, Xiao YanXue felt her heart ache and consoled, \u201cEven if this is the case, it wouldn\u2019t be too serious. Let the generals block the soldiers and damp block the flood. We may not end up losing to Yu ManLou. Furthermore, he is almost turning fifty already and would it be that easy for him to have a child? Perhaps it may be a daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a chuckle and said with ease and even excitement, \u201cNothing is absolute in the world. However, so what if Yu ManLou can walk out from his hopelessness? Don\u2019t you think that things are more interesting that way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMore interesting?\u201d Xiao YanXue glared at Ling Tian, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d She was only trying to console Ling Tian but she was truthfully the person who felt the greatest regret!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian crossed his arms and said proudly, \u201cWe are in chaotic times and this is also the time when heroes are born. Every time such chaotic times spread throughout the continent, what follows after it would definitely be the unification of the continent. Just as the saying goes, what splits up will join back eventually, what is joined together will split up eventually.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 what has this got to do with Yu ManLou?\u201d Xiao YanXue blinked her eyes and asked with doubt.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cSince the world is going to be united, there will definitely be a peerless ruler emerging and sweeping through the continent, am I right? This is also the pattern by which history develops right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. How would a mediocre individual be able to unite the world and call himself sovereign?\u201d Xiao YanXue said with a \u2018you don\u2019t say\u2019 look.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, how can an individual display his extraordinary capabilities?\u201d Ling Tian pointed up towards the sky, \u201cHe can only do so when there are other heroic, ambitious, villainous and special characters in the world, fighting them to the bitter death while treating the world as his chessboard! If one is able to rule over the world without a hitch, that would only mean that he is extremely lucky and does not mean a thing.\u201d Ling Tian smiled proudly, \u201cOne would only be able to display how extraordinary he is when facing a powerful opponent!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe life without an opponent is extremely boring.\u201d Ling Tian sighed, \u201cRather than win a war without challenge, I would rather die in a vigorous large-scale battle! Yu ManLou will be the biggest whetstone in my life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s eyes glowed with radiance, \u201cOnly when this whetstone is hard enough can the sword be sharpened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Ling Tian\u2019s sudden majestic display, a trace of intoxication flashed past Xiao YanXue\u2019s eyes. However, she asked with ridicule on the surface, \u201cOh? If that\u2019s the case, you are trying to say that you are the hegemon who is going to unite the continent?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d Ling Tian raised his head up arrogantly. \u201cIn this world, I, Ling Tian, will be the main character! The main character! I am Ling Tian and I want to rule over the world! My purpose in the world is to rule over the world!\u201d He then mused in his heart, If I am not the main character, why did I transmigrate into this world? This is transmigration; it would be even weirder if I transmigrated into this world to sell cabbages in the market!</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh!\u201d Xiao YanXue snorted with disdain and turned around without saying a thing.</p><br/><p>A long while later, Xiao YanXue turned back and said with frustration, \u201cThere is something that I still don\u2019t understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Even the wise and valiant Miss Xiao is puzzled?\u201d Ling Tian said in a teasing tone.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue grunted before saying with a frown, \u201cIf Yu ManLou only wants to raise an offspring, why can\u2019t he find a random maid to be concubine from his Yu Residence? With the huge size of the Yu Residence, there should be at least a hundred ladies, right? Could it be that he can\u2019t even pick one out? He really had to humiliate the former prime minister of Northern Wei? After all, the prime minister\u2019s family is considered a huge family not to be underestimated!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumiliate?\u201d Ling Tian looked at Xiao YanXue with an odd expression, \u201cIs this a form of humiliation? Shouldn\u2019t it be boundless glory? Since you can deduce so many things, why can\u2019t you understand that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, how should I put this? Could it be that it is considered glorious for a former prime minister like him to marry off his daughter to an old man in three days?\u201d Xiao YanXue said with her lips pouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course it is a huge glory!\u201d Ling Tian cried out, \u201cI believe that prime minister is probably jumping for joy at the moment! A prime minister should probably have some brains after all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJumping for joy? I think he should be hopping in anger instead!\u201d Xiao YanXue snorted, \u201cHis only daughter being taken in as a concubine by an old man nearing fifty! Furthermore, it wasn\u2019t even a choice for him. What can he be happy about?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly lass, this is the scheme of a monarch and was Yu ManLou\u2019s intention. As long as the prime minister understands that, he would only feel glory and not the slightest bit of grievance.\u201d Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cSince the prime minister was once the prime minister of Northern Wei, he would have lived his life for nothing if he can\u2019t understand something so simple.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

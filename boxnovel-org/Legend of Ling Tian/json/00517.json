Am I supposed to wait for my death without doing anything? I am not resigned!\u201d DongFang JingLei grew anxious as he looked at Ling Tian with a burning gaze. \u201cBrother Ling, even if their forces are strong, it is impossible for them to be stronger than you. As long as you are willing to help me, my situation will not be completely hopeless! As long as you help me today to tide through this difficult time, anything can be discussed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stood up and paced around slowly with a frown. Currently, DongFang JingLei was no longer in the right state of mind and had laid out all of his cards! If DongFang JingLei could become the Family Head of the DongFang Family, just what would happen? Would such an outcome be a good or bad thing for him? Furthermore, were there any other benefits he could get out of this matter?</p><br/><p>After a few rounds, he unknowingly noticed Xiao YanXue looking at him with a frown, and his eyes shone with an idea.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian quickly returned to his seat and looked at DongFang JingLei, \u201cI long had the intention to form an alliance with you and I am not a despicable individual who would go back on my word. Even if you are in dire straits now, my words are still valid! I can promise you that I will help you ascend to the position of the DongFang Family Head!\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang Jing Lei exclaimed and thanked Ling Tian profusely. Today, he was almost at his wit\u2019s end, and Ling Tian was basically his last hope. If Ling Tian were to reject him, DongFang JingLei would have no choice but to live in seclusion for the rest of his life! Furthermore, that is provided that he could ensure that he wasn\u2019t discovered by the DongFang Family!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do you need me to do? The forces under my command currently are extremely limited!\u201d After a wave of agitation, DongFang JingLei finally regained his cool and wisdom. Based on what he knew about Ling Tian, DongFang JingLei was certain that Ling Tian was definitely not a helpful and selfless individual. DongFang JingLei was certain that Ling Tian would only give him aid if there were benefits! But it was also because he knew that Ling Tian was such a person that DongFang JingLei was extremely assured. In DongFang JingLei\u2019s heart, regardless of how good a comrade was, the moment one loses his worth, there wouldn\u2019t be a point to form an alliance anymore. In fact, DongFang JingLei was extremely thankful that he was of some worth to Ling Tian thus resulting in this cooperation. In any case, it would be much better than escaping for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I need you to do?\u201d Ling Tian smiled profoundly, \u201cMy future DongFang Family Head, what do you think you can do with your current strength?! Before the situation stabilizes, there isn\u2019t a need for you to do anything. However, I hope that you will not hesitate when it is time for you to do something. Do you understand? Not a single shred of hesitation!\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei fell silent. He could naturally understand the hidden meaning behind Ling Tian\u2019s words. This person obviously had a huge ambition towards Eastern Zhao and the DongFang Family! DongFang JingLei pondered in his heart if it was worth for him to make such a decision.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sat by the side in a leisure manner and was not anxious in the slightest. After all, the one who needed to be anxious now was DongFang JingLei. Thus, Ling Tian gave him ample time to consider the matter.</p><br/><p>A long while later, DongFang JingLei said with difficulty, \u201cDongFang\u2026 Fa\u2026mily\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe DongFang Family will not perish!\u201d Ling Tian interrupted, \u201cBrother DongFang, you should know that even if I do not have a chess piece like you, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for me to achieve my goal. I would only need to spend a little bit more time. At the same time, time is something that I am not lacking at the moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are right! I promise you!\u201d DongFang JingLei clenched his teeth, and the look on his face was that of a gambling addict going all-in. At this moment, the look on DongFang JingLei\u2019s face seemed slightly malevolent.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian went silent for a moment before bursting out laughing, \u201cBrother DongFang, we are only having a conversation and not fighting for our lives. For you to have such an expression, it looks as though I am trying to bully you! I am trying to help you here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble must be joking,\u201d DongFang JingLei said with a bitter laugh as he thought in his heart, Isn\u2019t this considered bullying me? You have bullied me to the point I cannot fend for myself anymore! After taking this step today, I can no longer turn back and will have to walk with you down this path all the way! But even though he knew all of these in his heart, DongFang JingLei still changed the way he addressed Ling Tian and no longer dared to address Ling Tian as an equal. From the moment I change the way I address him, I will be serving under a lord and no longer have the right to speak to him as an equal. If I want to have authority in my hands, I will definitely have to pay a huge and heavy price.</p><br/><p>Hearing the way DongFang JingLei addressed him, Ling Tian\u2019s eyes glowed and a trace of elation could be seen in his eyes. He knew that DongFang JingLei was still unresigned in his heart despite already being at his wit\u2019s end. However, Ling Tian was certain that he was capable of making DongFang JingLei submit to him completely in future! He was confident that he would be able to show DongFang JingLei how worthless he was without him!</p><br/><p>However, this was not the right time to subdue DongFang JingLei.</p><br/><p>After pondering for a moment, Ling Tian said slowly, \u201cI will command Shen RuHu to coordinate with you and put up a show. But before that, you have to enter the headquarters of the DongFang Family secretly and stand out when there is a change!\u201d His calm eyes suddenly seemed to have transformed into a piercing dagger as he stared at DongFang JingLei with a threatening glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cChanges?\u201d DongFang JingLei asked with a depressed tone before suddenly gasping with shock, \u201cYoung noble, are you thinking of\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian nodded his head, \u201cWhy, do you have any questions? Since you have already decided to plant your carrots on this plot of land, we must first uproot the original radishes. If not, where would you find the space to plant your crops?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he is still my older brother\u2026\u201d DongFang JingLei said with a hint of apprehension.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at DongFang JingLei silently before laughing in an eccentric manner. He then glared at DongFang JingLei coldly causing DongFang JingLei to feel a wave of discomfort.</p><br/><p>A short while later, Ling Tian said coldly, \u201cDongFang JingLei, you can save this show for DongFang JingTian\u2019s funeral! Putting on such a show in front of me is akin to winking to a blind man! You are truly not a good actor at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei\u2019s face flushed red.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian snorted, \u201cYour big brother? Since when did you treat him like a big brother? You are probably hoping for his death at this very moment! You are just helpless at this moment! For you to act as though you care dearly for your brother at this moment, aren\u2019t you only trying to make it seem as though you are extremely loyal and compassionate to give yourself more chips in the future? Do you think that such tricks of yours are meaningful?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian flicked his sleeves, \u201cLet me give you a warning. Don\u2019t play these little tricks in front of me! Since you are going to become a prostitute, you better erect a huge signboard and be open about it! Don\u2019t try and act as though you are still a chaste virgin! It is best for you to not erect a chastity arch. Right, this little act of yours is still useful. You should put up this show at your brother\u2019s funeral!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s words were extremely barbed, and DongFang JingLei simmered with anger. After forcefully suppressing his anger, DongFang JingLei lowered his head and said, \u201cYoung noble\u2019s teachings are right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian went silent for a moment before saying, \u201cI shall be leaving now. After this matter is settled, I will return to Sky Bearing and will not return anymore. In future, Eastern Zhao will be in your hands. If there isn\u2019t a need, I will not find you in the future. You will still be you, the future DongFang Family Head and only spokesperson of the DongFang Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>After standing up, Ling Tian let out a long breath and said without turning back, \u201cDongFang JingLei, you are extremely intelligent and scheming. Your foundation isn\u2019t weak, and you are pretty talented. I do not have anyone else capable in Eastern Zhao and so I can only benefit you. Thus, you are actually pretty lucky!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if you want to protect the DongFang Family, then let me give you a warning: Do not make me fearful of you! You should know that what accompanies my fear would be your death!\u201d Ling Tian said with undisguised killing intent, \u201cYou must understand that killing you is as easy as flipping over my palms!\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei burst out in a cold sweat and acknowledged Ling Tian\u2019s words repeatedly. He then suddenly remembered what Ling Tian said and could not help but ask, \u201cYoung noble will return to Sky Bearing immediately?\u201d He should not have asked this question but still ended up asking it! This was because Ling Tian\u2019s bet with Justice still had two more months to go. At the same time, the outcome of this bet was extremely important to DongFang JingLei!</p><br/><p>He was longing for Ling Tian\u2019s death a while ago, but he was now praying for Ling Tian\u2019s survival. At the very least, Ling Tian must not die before he could unite the DongFang Family! At this moment, Justice was the biggest variable.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian revealed a trace of a smile. He had been intentionally avoiding this question because he was waiting for DongFang JingLei to bring it up. Indeed, DongFang JingLei did not disappoint him.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian responded with an \u2018oh\u2019 before saying calmly, \u201cYes, back to Sky Bearing.\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei asked with incredulity, \u201cThen young noble\u2019s bet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is already invalid!\u201d Ling Tian replied calmly, \u201cJustice has given up on the bet! He gave it up willingly!\u201d</p><br/><p>AH?! DongFang JingLei was flabbergasted! Justice had given up the bet willingly? What did this mean? Could it be that Justice didn\u2019t have the strength to kill Ling Tian? Or could it be that Ling Tian\u2019s strength was already at Justice\u2019s realm? Thus, Justice would give up willingly?</p><br/><p>If that was the case, wouldn\u2019t that mean that Ling Tian was invincible? Could it be that there wasn\u2019t anyone capable of killing him?!</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei\u2019s heart was thrown into a mess as he looked at Ling Tian speechlessly with his mouth wide opened.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian knew that DongFang JingLei was thinking about and did not bother explaining anything. This was the effect he wanted and thus intentionally replied DongFang JingLei with ambiguity. With such a shock, DongFang JingLei would not dare to have any malicious thoughts!</p><br/><p>At the same time, Ling Tian could not help but snicker in his heart, Justice\u2019s reputation is still the best! Is this considered borrowing his prestige?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian nodded his head before holding onto Xiao YanXue\u2019s hand and walking out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble have a safe trip. JingLei sends young noble off.\u201d Behind Ling Tian, DongFang JingLei\u2019s tone was completely different. It was now filled with fear, respect, and even reverence!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian placed his hand on Xiao YanXue lips and with a gasp, the two of them disappeared from DongFang JingLei\u2019s sight!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

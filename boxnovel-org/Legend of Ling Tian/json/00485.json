Why must he marry a lady from a big family? This is so that his future child would have sufficient status and foundation to ascend the throne in future including a sufficiently powerful mother clan! Do you understand? The more he chooses a lady from a prestigious family, the more he doesn\u2019t place any hope in the two sons of his! His anxiousness represents the importance which he places in this matter. Furthermore, his action would also mean that Yu ManLou was extremely satisfied and regarded this former prime minister greatly. Why shouldn\u2019t he be happy? If Yu ManLou united the continent in future, his grandson would be the future ruler of the world and his family would be carried to new heights as well! Can all of these benefits not outweigh a single daughter of his?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then added with a mocking smile, \u201cBesides, a daughter will have to be married out eventually. If you were in his shoes, would you rather your daughter be the empress or even the empress dowager? Or would you rather your daughter marry a poor scholar? As long as Yu ManLou can unite the world, then the imperial throne would not escape from them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the world today, is there a family which is even stronger than the Yu Family?\u201d Ling Tian scoffed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 no wonder\u2026\u201d Xiao YanXue suddenly lowered her head with depression. After understanding all of these, she thought about how her family wanted to force her into a marriage and could not help but feel dejected.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao YanXue\u2019s expression, Ling Tian naturally knew what this lass was thinking about. He could not help but let out a sigh and smile. \u201cWhy? Seeing an old cow like Yu ManLou eat fresh grass is making Miss Xiao feel regret? Miss Xiao can\u2019t wait to get married off? Should I go and inform Yu ManLou? After all, the princess of the Xiao Family would definitely have a much higher status than the former prime minister\u2019s daughter! I believe that Yu ManLou would definitely change his mind. After all, he should be willing to listen to my opinions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian you\u2026 you\u2026 why don\u2019t you just go and die!\u201d Xiao YanXue was embarrassed and angered by Ling Tian\u2019s words and did not even have the time to feel any form of self-pity. She quickly grabbed the teacup and flung it towards him.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian burst into laughter and avoided it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you snatch Yu ManLou\u2019s bride\u2026\u201d Xiao YanXue suddenly said with a flash of inspiration.</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k!\u201d Ling Tian was shocked out of his wits, \u201cBig sister, you should just take those words as a joke. Don\u2019t count on me to be so crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue let out a bright smile filled with grace and elegance. Ling Tian felt his head go dizzy as he almost fell into the beauty\u2019s trap.</p><br/><p>Three days later, the news of the Yu Family having a wedding had spread all across the world. Just as Ling Tian had expected, that former prime minister, Su JianYan, jumped for joy and sent his daughter over gleefully with his whole residence celebrating secretly. In such chaotic times, their family had managed to cling to the strongest family on the continent!</p><br/><p>Just when the bride\u2019s sedan entered the Yu Residence, Ling Tian leisurely rode out of the city with Xiao YanXue.</p><br/><p>Nobody knew why Ling Tian only left today or what he had done in the past three days. This secret made Yu ManLou frustrated for a long time after he found out about Ling Tian\u2019s whereabouts. It was only until many years later that Yu ManLou found out just what Ling Tian had planted in these three days. The things that Ling Tian had done and planted in these three days almost wiped out the Yu Family in a single night! At that time, everything was different and everything was too late\u2026</p><br/><p>The sun gradually set, and mist began to rise from all directions. However, two horses continued to walk along the road at a steady pace as though they weren\u2019t afraid of not having a place to stay for the night.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are we going? Why are you always giving me a perfunctory reply!\u201d The crisp voice of a young lady could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss, this is the seventh time you have asked me this question.\u201d A helpless reply could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you do not always reply to me with a \u2018haha\u2019 without telling me where we are going, would I be pestering you? Since you don\u2019t want to reply to me, of course I have to continue asking! I will keep asking until I get my answer,\u201d the young lady reprimanded with dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLaugh\u2026just keep laughing\u2026 you darn idiot who only knows how to laugh! I heard that you want to go towards the DongFang Family?\u201d Her doubtful voice sounded, \u201cIt seems like you have some agreement with DongFang JingLei? According to our current route, we are definitely headed towards the DongFang Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 Miss Xiao is indeed an intelligent lady, and your guess is pretty accurate!\u201d A laugh could be heard, \u201cI heard that the Eastern Zhao crown prince proposed a marriage to the Xiao Family. I am about to send the precious princess of the Xiao Family to get married so that the Eastern Zhao Empire can be my stepping stone to power. Is this plan of mine fantastic?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 annoying! You b*st*rd! You baddie! You\u2019re too bad!\u201d The young lady began whining, and the conversation topic was successfully changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d Noticing the horse of the young man stopping, Xiao YanXue turned behind to see an odd expression on the young man\u2019s face. His smile didn\u2019t seem like a smile and even seemed a little\u2026 vulgar.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am thinking\u2026\u201d Ling Tian rubbed his chin and revealed a thoughtful look as a mischievous glow flashed past his eyes, \u201cI am thinking\u2026 what do you think Yu ManLou is doing tonight\u2026 it really makes my imagination roam!\u201d Ling Tian said with a cheeky smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is Yu ManLou doing tonight? Why would you think about that\u2026 AHH! Ling Tian you baddie! Can\u2019t you be more serious?!\u201d Xiao YanXue\u2019s face turned completely red as though her whole body was on fire.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then looked at Xiao YanXue with a smile which didn\u2019t seem like a smile as his eyes roamed around her body with two devilish chuckles. Looking at her in the eyes, Ling Tian then let out a devilish grin.</p><br/><p>What was Yu ManLou doing? What else could Yu ManLou be doing? On their wedding night, other than consummating their marriage, could he be planting cabbages instead? As long as he had the heart and strength, he would definitely be having a good time. Of course, if Yu ManLou had the heart but not the strength\u2026 Ling Tian\u2019s smile became even weirder.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Xiao YanXue\u2019s body turned soft from Ling Tian\u2019s odd glare and she was both embarrassed and angry in her heart. Of all things to think about, Ling Tian had to think about Yu ManLou consummating his marriage. At the same time, Ling Tian actually looked at her with such an odd expression while thinking about that. If that\u2019s the case, weren\u2019t his thoughts extremely clear?</p><br/><p>Understanding Ling Tian\u2019s lecherous thoughts, Xiao YanXue\u2019s face flushed red and her eyes were lit on fire. She immediately waved her horse whip around and charged at Ling Tian viciously.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian burst into laughter and sprinted away on his horse. As he escaped from Xiao YanXue, he shouted at the same time, \u201cI forgot about something else. What would an old antique like Yu ManLou know? Even if he has the heart and strength, he may not be able to please his new wife well. If he can go for a few remedial lessons first by watching some p*rn, it should be of great help to him\u2026\u201d Ling Tian lamented with regret, \u201cIf that old man realizes that his spear is no longer sharp at the very last minute and is unable to break through the city\u2026 hahahaha\u2026\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s malicious thoughts were completely revealed at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, you\u2026 gangster! You you you\u2026 ruffian!\u201d Although Xiao YanXue didn\u2019t know what p*rn was, she knew that it definitely wasn\u2019t something good. Thus, her face turned even redder as she chased after Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian escaped on his horse, he began to laugh lasciviously. He then suddenly thought to himself, If the \u2018pa pa\u2019 sound of him whipping the horse was placed outside the bridal room as a sound effect\u2026 it could probably pass off as the real thing, right? Hahaha\u2026</p><br/><p>The young man and lady then gradually disappeared into the darkness. As for where they intended to go, it was still unclear at the moment\u2026</p><br/><p>Southern Zheng!</p><br/><p>Gold Jade City.</p><br/><p>In the NanGong Family, the sound of crying could be heard at every corner and white banners were seen everywhere. The news of their Family Head\u2019s death was akin to the sky falling down!</p><br/><p>\u201cEndure?! When should we continue enduring until? Big brother is already dead, and you still want me to continue enduring?!\u201d NanGong TianHu paced around the room like a tiger trapped in the cage as he roared with bloodshot eyes, \u201cI can\u2019t endure any longer! I CAN\u2019T!!!\u201d He then waved his fists around with spittle flying in all direction as his loud roar caused the roof to tremble slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to endure either, but we have to endure! Endure what others can\u2019t endure! If we don\u2019t, we will die! The whole family will perish! It doesn\u2019t matter if you or I die, but can second uncle really sacrifice the lives of the thousand people in the NanGong Family?!\u201d A crisp voice came out from the frail lady by the side, and the rims of NanGong Yu\u2019s eyes were red. \u201cSecond uncle, this is not the time for you to be rash. Your rashness will only bring us destruction!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, Yu\u2019er, you are truly calm and composed.\u201d NanGong TianHu sneered, \u201cBoth your father and brother are dead and the authority of the family is held in your hands. Of course you are able to remain calm and you are probably feeling ecstatic at the moment right?! You are even thanking the culprit who murdered your father right? You don\u2019t even want to take revenge for your biological father?! Good! Good! Good!\u201d NanGong TianHu nodded his head and was filled with grief and indignation, \u201cWhat a filial daughter indeed! What a filial daughter indeed! It is a pity that up until his death, big brother never noticed how \u2018filial\u2019 you truly are!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond uncle! What nonsense are you spouting?\u201d NanGong Yu was angered to the point she stood up trembling, \u201cThe enmity of my father\u2019s death will never be reconciled! How will I ever let Ling Tian off? But do we have the strength to take revenge now? Do we have the strength to chase after Ling Tian? Even if we were to bring out all of our NanGong Family\u2019s troops, we will not be a match for Ling Tian! Have you not understood the strength of the Ling Family through the rebellion in Sky Bearing? Do you want our whole family to perish before you give up the idea of revenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t! What strength does the Ling Family have? I do not know and have not seen it!\u201d NanGong TianHu roared with agitation, \u201cHowever, we must take revenge for big brother! Even if the whole family is destroyed, we must ensure that the little brat is buried with us!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This was something that Li Xue had come up with and it could be mixed with an individual\u2019s blood or smeared on an individual\u2019s clothes. It was colorless without smell and difficult to detect. But if the chaser applied a special medicinal powder on his nose, this odorless smell would then be extremely distinct even from a thousand miles away.</p><br/><p>It would be extremely pungent!</p><br/><p>After wiping the special medicinal powder on his nose, he could immediately detect the trail of the nine individuals. It was as though he was following a garbage man with a leaking garbage truck.</p><br/><p>It can be imagined just how smelly the entire journey was!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian felt as though he was walking in a large pool of shit. At the same time, he cursed Li Xue in his heart many times over. She was indeed a demoness and even the medicine that she created was so disgusting. However, he did indeed have to admit that this medicine did indeed have a mystical effect when it came to tracking someone. It was just\u2026 too smelly!</p><br/><p>What Ling Jian did not know was that the \u2018medicinal powder\u2019 that he smeared on his nose was the feces of scorpions. It was also the only medicinal powder that was extremely pungent and was made especially for him. The powder that Ling Chi and the others smeared on their nose had a faint fragrant smell. Turning that faint fragrance into something so pungent required ten times the effort!</p><br/><p>In order to accomplish this, Li Xue had put in a great deal of effort. She initially intended to let Ling Tian enjoy such a treatment but never expected that Ling Tian would slack off today\u2026 As such, she could only let Ling Jian enjoy such a privilege.</p><br/><p>Ling Chi and the others naturally did not know about this. They only felt as though it was currently spring with the fragrance of flowers all around them. Tracking down the enemy suddenly seemed like a joyous event and they no longer felt any fatigue.</p><br/><p>As compared to the other assassins who were searching for a \u2018fragrant beauty\u2019, the number one assassin in the world, Ling Jian, was searching for a stinky old man!</p><br/><p>A short while after he gave chase, Ling Jian could clearly detect three pungent smells returning along the same road after making a round. This also meant that there were six others who were still out. All the assassins were pursuing the Yu Family members carefully. At this moment, the six had already left the city and went towards the east and south.</p><br/><p>After a short distance, another three individuals made a large round before returning to Sky Bearing City. There were only three left.</p><br/><p>Following that, after another 30 miles, the six assassins gathered together. At this moment, there were only two Yu Family members left. Furthermore, they were proceeding down the same path.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Jian\u2019s appearance was extremely miserable and he was already panting heavily from the odor of the tracking powder. Even with his perseverance, there were many times where he almost couldn\u2019t stop himself from puking. Looking at the other five assassins with a look of comfort on their faces as they took in deep breaths as though they were enjoying the scent, Ling Jian was extremely puzzled!</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t I know that these brats have a fetish for something so stinky? What is going on?</p><br/><p>Before Ling Jian could even ask anything, Ling Chi already felt that something was wrong. It was just far too obvious. The five of them seemed to be enjoying themselves greatly but Ling Jian looked as though he had just eaten a full bucket of shit!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Jian, is there anything wrong? Why is your face so ugly? Were you too hasty in your cultivation and your qi deviated to the wrong meridian?\u201d Ling Chi asked with worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it all because of this tracking powder!\u201d Ling Jian cursed in frustration, \u201cIt is just far too smelly and unbearable!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Smelly? Unbearable?\u201d Ling Chi gasped in shock, \u201cHow is this possible! Brother Jian, is there anything wrong with your nose?!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, after he tried the medicinal powder that Ling Jian used, Ling Chi was also thoroughly disgusted. He hurriedly took in deep breaths of his own fragrant powder to clear his nose of the pungent and unpleasant smell. The two extremes were far too frightening! Thinking about how Ling Jian had given chase all the way out of the city by following such a smell, Ling Chi looked at Ling Jian with a look of worship. \u201cBrother Jian, I truly admire how you were able to be so persistent in the face of this unbearable stench! You are truly far too amazing! Ling Chi is full of admiration\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian almost fainted from anger.</p><br/><p>He then used the fastest possible speed which he could muster to exchange the tracking powder for the one that Ling Chi and the rest were using. Only then did he fully understand the misery which he had just gone through. It was akin to the difference between heaven and hell! From the stench to the fragrance, it was like going from hell to heaven!</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face was no longer bitter but thoroughly darkened. At the same time, killing intent gushed out from his body and Ling Chi was frightened silly without daring to open his mouth. At this moment, the person who opened his mouth would definitely be seeking trouble!</p><br/><p>The path was dark and there seemed to be a small village before them. This village would not house more than 200 families and would have a population of 600 at the very most. Such a small village wasn\u2019t a rare sight around Sky Bearing City.</p><br/><p>As the two Yu Family members arrived here, their figures disappeared and the faint fragrance was all over the city.</p><br/><p>The entire surrounding was pitch black and Ling Jian could instinctively feel that something was wrong. Lifting his hand up, all six of them stopped giving chase.</p><br/><p>On top of a small hill, Ling Jian thought to himself carefully. Why would this village give him such an odd feeling?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is too quiet!\u201d Ling Chi said softly and pointed out the greatest oddity.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the two of them went in, there isn\u2019t even the sound of dogs barking!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot a single animal sound could be heard.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis village does not even have a single person snoring!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the doubtful points were raised and the six of them looked at each other. Even with their experience, they could not help but have goosebumps! The village before them was far too strange! Just what kind of a village was this?! Why would there be such a deathly aura around it?!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Jian, based on our experience, there is only a single possibility.\u201d Flames of rage could be seen in Ling Chi\u2019s eyes as he came to a conclusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone is dead?\u201d Ling Jian said softly. He also understood that this was the only reasonable explanation or such a scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not all.\u201d Ling Chi grit his teeth and his eyes gleamed coldly. \u201cBreathing can still be heard in the village and there is a faint layer of fog in the night sky. Such a scene can only appear if there are humans present. Furthermore, the village must be densely populated. Based on my estimates, not only are all the villagers dead, there are troops disguised as villagers living within this village.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, all of these troops are extremely well disciplined and definitely do not belong to an ordinary army. They are probably members of Above Heavens or the Yu Family!\u201d Ling Jian nodded his head slowly, \u201cThis village is probably their little nest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMassacring an entire village and not leaving behind even the animals!\u201d Ling Chi said with a heavy tone, \u201cThey then seized the houses of others for themselves and did not even spare the young or old! How vicious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut after killing so many people, there should be a dense smell of blood in the air.\u201d Ling Feng asked, \u201cHowever, the surrounding area obviously does not have any bloody smell. How do you explain this?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTime.\u201d Ling Jian spat out coldly and rage could be seen in all of their eyes.</p><br/><p>Annihilating an entire clan was something that any one of these six individuals had done before. However, all of those they killed deserved to die! None of them had massacred an entire village of innocent villagers before!</p><br/><p>Such an action was no different from being beasts!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the entire village is our enemy, we would be too big a target if all of us enter.\u201d Ling Jian said softly, \u201cAll of you wait here for me and I will go in alone. Let me find out more before making further plans.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful brother Jian.\u201d Ling Chi and the others had no objections. Be it cultivation or movement techniques, Ling Jian was naturally the most superior and naturally the most suitable candidate!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s figure slid out and his shot forward like a bolt of lightning. After a couple of breaths, he was already at the outermost wall of the village. He then climbed up the wall like a lizard and the moment his head was above the wall, he slid down the wall like a snake without bones. He then infiltrated the village and followed the two faint sense of fragrance.</p><br/><p>On top of an ordinary looking brick house, Ling Jian stopped and retracted all of his aura. At the same time, he extended his senses to the biggest possible range.</p><br/><p>Nothing can go wrong at this moment!</p><br/><p>After four powerful divine senses swept past his body, Ling Jian could not help but be startled! Their defenses were so tight! It was already close to daybreak but the people inside still kept their guard up so high!</p><br/><p>The sound of soft chattering could be heard, \u201c\u2026 the preparations are about to be completed. Rest assured\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 the faster the better! The time is arriving and nothing can go wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of the herbs have been prepared and we are only waiting for them to be delivered. At that time, we just have to see the wind direction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, that\u2019s the best. We can begin our operation and we should cease contact for the time being. We only need to move according to the plan when the time comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you need me to send you a couple of hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou do not need to worry about this. Just accomplish your own task well!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>As the conversation in the room finished, the sound of a rooster crowing could be heard and the east seemed to be getting brighter.</p><br/><p>Two black figures drifted out from the room without anyone sending them out. A short while later, a couple of figures appeared from all directions. After looking around to make sure that nothing was wrong, they disappeared back into the darkness.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s figure disappeared like a gust of wind.</p><br/><p>The next day, Ling Family Courtyard.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian who had not slept for the entire night stood in front of Ling Tian brimming with energy.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s slender finger rapped on the table as he looked as though he was in deep thought, \u201cLing Jian, the entire village is filled with our enemies? There are many experts? Is this information accurate?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will not be wrong for sure! There are 500 people in the village at the very least and no less than 20 XianTian level experts. Furthermore, there are four top-notch experts at the very least.\u201d Ling Jian said solemnly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, you heard them mention something about herbs?\u201d Ling Tian asked with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! In large quantities!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, immediately arrange for manpower to spy on the village. Report to me the moment something is transported into the village.\u201d Ling Tian said softly with his eyes brimming with killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! Young noble, what about the manpower?\u201d Ling Jian asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, me you, Ling Chen and Li Xue shall take action together! Ling Chi and the fifty of them shall all participate in this mission! Not a single person shall be allowed to escape!\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s palm sliced down like a blade.</p><br/><p>\u201cKilling innocent villagers and massacring the young and old are actions not tolerated by the heavens!\u201d Ling Tian stood up with his face solemn, \u201cThose who kill shall be killed! Make sure to capture them alive and after burying the corpses of the villagers, we shall perform a living sacrifice with these culprits!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter must be carried out in secret and the members of the Yu Family in the city cannot find out about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

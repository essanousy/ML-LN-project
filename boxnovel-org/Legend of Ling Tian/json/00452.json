Furthermore, there are only a handful of people aware of the shape and design of the jade pendant. Apart from the core members of the Yu Family, there shouldn\u2019t be anyone else aware of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, everyone couldn\u2019t help but be extremely moved. Yu ManLou\u2019s words were also akin to displaying how much he trusted everyone present. They all couldn\u2019t help but be extremely grateful and moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then things are truly bizarre.\u201d Everyone began to frown in deep thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that he wanted to save the First Pavilion Head but didn\u2019t have anything else with him and thus had no choice but to use the jade? However, he never expected that Family Head would be able to snatch it and in his anxiousness, he decided to destroy the jade to protect his identity.\u201d</p><br/><p>After discussing the matter for a long time, everyone felt that this was the only reasonable explanation and nodded their heads in agreement.</p><br/><p>No matter what, everyone was certain that the Shui Family was definitely behind the mission tonight! Not a single one of them doubted this conjecture.</p><br/><p>Everyone was filled with indignation as they cursed the Shui Family for their despicable actions. They were filled with hatred towards the Shui Family for the actions they hired the First Pavilion to perform!</p><br/><p>As all of them cursed the Shui Family, someone suddenly remarked, \u201cFamily Head, could it be that the First Pavilion was set up by the Shui Family? Would an ordinary power dare to pit themselves against our Yu Family? While it is true that assassins are only hired by money, they would need to have the life to spend it! Regardless of how powerful they are, an ordinary assassin organization shouldn\u2019t dare to provoke our Yu Family for some silver, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>When this bold conjecture was raised, everyone present was immediately silenced. Even after their long discussion, none of them had actually thought in that direction. They all treated the First Pavilion as an independent organization because the First Pavilion was just too famous for the past few years! None of them were willing to believe that the Shui Family was able to nurture such a powerful side branch. Furthermore, the Shui Family which had the First Pavilion by their side would be extremely difficult to evaluate.</p><br/><p>\u201cI originally thought so as well. However, I thought about another possibility as well that would solve all of our previous doubts!\u201d Yu ManLou said.</p><br/><p>Everyone bowed, \u201cMay Family Head instruct us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe, or perhaps, I jumped to a conclusion far too quickly. That black-masked man may not be the legendary First Pavilion Head!\u201d Yu ManLou said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it possible? If he isn\u2019t the First Pavilion Head, how could his concealment technique be so exceptional? He managed to hide from us all and his killing methods are extremely terrifying. If you were to say that he wasn\u2019t the best assassin in the world, I wouldn\u2019t be able to believe it!\u201d the Firmament Charging Pavilion Head, Yu ZhanFeng, said. Out of the many experts present, the person who wanted to kill Ling Jian the most was undeniably Yu ZhanFeng ! 1</p><br/><p>\u201cThe black-masked man who had fought all of you had undoubtedly achieved exceptional heights in his inner qi, martial arts, and movement techniques. Furthermore, his concealment technique is unfathomable and thus I jumped to the conclusion that he was the First Pavilion Head!\u201d Yu ManLou explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen are there any more doubts?\u201d Yu ZhanFeng asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are many suspicious points. First, I originally didn\u2019t want to form enmity with the First Pavilion and even had the intention of subduing them. Thus, I promised them generous conditions at the start. If he was truly the First Pavilion Head, even if he wouldn\u2019t agree to my demands, he shouldn\u2019t have remained silent. In fact, as long as he pointed out the power which hired him, I would have immediately let him off. It was a pity that he didn\u2019t say anything from start to end! Could it be that it was because he didn\u2019t have the authority to make such a decision?\u201d Yu ManLou said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this is the only suspicious point then it can be easily explained. An elite assassin wouldn\u2019t open his mouth and as the First Pavilion Head, he definitely has a great deal of pride. It is reasonable for him to remain silent!\u201d the Head Deacon said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the second suspicious point which I wanted to point out. What does everyone think about the first person\u2019s movement techniques?!\u201d Yu ManLou asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was like a formless shadow and his movements were completely unpredictable. I have never seen such a weird movement technique!\u201d While Yu ZhanFeng hated Ling Jian to the bone, he felt a lingering fear when thinking about Ling Jian\u2019s martial arts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is where the second suspicious point is. I exchanged a few blows with the second black-masked man and the exquisiteness of his movement technique is even above the first black-masked man! If the first person is like a shadow, the second person has exceeded the realm of a shadow! Furthermore, both of their movement techniques definitely belong to the same origin! This is undeniable!\u201d Yu ManLou said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to what Family Head said, the second black-masked man definitely belongs to the Shui Family. If that\u2019s the case, doesn\u2019t that prove that the First Pavilion belongs to the Shui Family?!\u201d The Head Deacon argued.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot necessarily. Since the second masked man belongs to the Shui Family, the first masked man must definitely belong to the Shui Family as well. However, the first masked man may not necessarily be the First Pavilion Head like what I had deduced. In fact, he may not even belong to the First Pavilion! Comparing both of their martial arts, it is more likely that the second masked man is the First Pavilion Head. However, would a Shui Family member who is holding onto the ancestral treasure of the Shui Family risk himself to save a partner that he is working with? If he isn\u2019t careful, he may very well perish in the process. Thus, I deduce that while the both of them would definitely belong to the Shui Family, they may not necessarily belong to the First Pavilion!\u201d Yu ManLou concluded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, the strength the Shui Family has stationed in Bright Jade City can\u2019t be underestimated. With the presence of such an individual, our previous arrangements have to be adjusted, lest we suffer a loss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a good suggestion.\u201d Yu ManLou agreed, \u201cThe Head Deacon shall be in charge of the adjustments. As for the First Pavilion\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy conjecture is no more than a conjecture. Regardless of whether or not the First Pavilion is related to the Shui Family, they are definitely our enemy. Which power they belong to isn\u2019t that important.\u201d Yu ManLou stared at the shattered jade pendant in front of him and fell into deep thought. Waving his hands, he said, \u201cYou guys may take your leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone bowed to Yu ManLou and silently retreated.</p><br/><p>When Ling Tian threw out this piece of jade, he never imagined that the jade that Shui QianRou gave him had such an important origin! In fact, even Shui QianRou herself may not have known about it! If Ling Tian knew about the origin, he surely would never have used the jade pendant.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian never imagined that his originally flawless plan was riddled with holes because of this mysterious jade pendant! He never imagined that due to the great origins of this piece of jade, the Yu Family would come up with so many explanations because he destroyed it.</p><br/><p>However, with every loss comes a gain. The loss of the precious jade pendant was definitely a huge loss but where was the gain?</p><br/><p>Under the dim glow of the lamp, Ling Jian\u2019s bloodied unconscious body lay on the bed with his eyes closed.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s hands worked swiftly to the point that after images could be seen. Stopping his blood, poking his acupoint, cleaning his wounds, applying medicine, bandaging them\u2026 Seeing the busy Ling Tian, Li Xue who was walking in with a tub of hot water asked, \u201cYour subordinate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. He is my brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he training in the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula? You are truly so good to this brother of yours. His cultivation formula is almost complete and should be the same as yours right? You actually didn\u2019t hold anything back?!\u201d Li Xue asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is a brother in this life of mine. Why would I give my brother an incomplete cultivation formula?!\u201d Ling Tian stood up and wiped off the sweat on his forehead, \u201cOne of my objectives in entering Bright Jade City was to give them the completed Divine Shocking Dragon Formula. This matter can\u2019t be delayed. After all, they aren\u2019t like me who had the experience of cultivating the formula once. It is far too easy for something to go wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Li Xue turned around and said, \u201cHis martial arts are truly exceptional. Are you treating him like Jing WuMing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJing WuMing?\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s eyes narrowed, \u201cJing WuMing was just a slave of ShangGuan JinHong. How can he be compared to Ling Jian? Let me repeat myself, Ling Jian is my brother! My brother for all eternity!JinJ \u201d 2</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, hmph.\u201d Li Xue grunted, \u201cEvery single move of his is obviously a killing move. Furthermore, they are the sharpest and cleanest way to kill someone. Actually, would it be a bad thing to have a subordinate like Jing WuMing? A fiercely loyal individual who would follow his master regardless of right or wrong? This is a servant that all ambitious figures would hope to have!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a bitter laugh and didn\u2019t say another thing. It would be extremely difficult to change the mind of this stubborn lass. Furthermore, during the initial phase of him training them, he did indeed work towards that direction. It was only after the many years of interaction and sincerity by Ling Jian which changed his mind. From then on, Ling Tian truly treated Ling Jian as a brother. This was something that was better left unsaid.</p><br/><p>Li Xue let out a chuckle and tactfully changed the topic. Seeing Ling Tian busily tending to Ling Jian\u2019s wounds, she stood by the door and asked, \u201cYou changed your cultivation formula slightly when in the Yu Family right? From afar, I didn\u2019t notice a huge commotion in the battle and it was obviously extremely different from your usual style.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian revealed a bright smile, \u201cThat was the Shui Family\u2019s cultivation formula. I tried my best to emulate it.\u201d As he said that, he sliced off a piece of curled up flesh on Ling Jian\u2019s back. Despite still being unconscious, Ling Jian\u2019s back very obviously trembled in pain.</p><br/><p>After letting out a long \u2018oh\u2019, Li Xue said profoundly, \u201cIt seems like someone is scheming something again. No wonder.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

My granddaughter risked her life to save me and she is still suffering in Ling Tian\u2019s hands today. For Elder Meng to say these words now, I wonder what your intentions are? Is this Xiao not a member of the Xiao Family? Will I speak on behalf of my Xiao Family\u2019s enemy?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng FanYun snickered, \u201cSecond Master said some incorrect things and was correct on some others. While Second Master may not betray the Xiao Family, it is difficult to say the same about others. Everyone in the world is aware that Miss Xiao YanXue holds a large amount of authority in the Ling Family Courtyard. She aids Ling Tian in managing his grain, money and transportation routes. How would she be suffering? Is Second Master treating Meng FanYun as an idiot? Could it be that Miss Xiao YanXue does not have the surname of Xiao and isn\u2019t a part of the Xiao Family? However, who knows which side she is actually on?! If you want me to believe that you have not surrendered to the enemy, the only way would be for you to give an order to to the armies to attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang flew into a rage, \u201cMeng FanYun, I respect you as a senior and shall not be so calculating with you. However, you better not go too far! This is the Xiao Family and the million soldiers on the outside are the sons of my Xiao Family! The decision to send out the army will be made by my brother and me! Even if you are the sect master of Above Heavens, you are only a guest in my Xiao Family. I don\u2019t think you have the authority to discuss military affairs! If Senior does not have anything else, you may take your leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Family, what a good Xiao Family! Is this an eviction order?!\u201d Meng FanYun sneered. He then raised his arm up and a powerful suction force was emitted from his palm. Despite being ten feet away from Xiao FengYang, he easily grabbed Xiao FengYang by the neck. With Xiao FengYang\u2019s neck in his hands, a cold gleam could be seen in his eyes and he said in a flat voice, \u201cXiao FengYang, even if you are the number two figure in the Xiao Family, this old man can easily turn you into ashes if you frustrate me! Do you think this old man doesn\u2019t dare to do that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan was startled and hurriedly attempted to mediate. \u201cMay Senior Meng quell your anger. Second brother suffered from great humiliation during his captivity and his emotions aren\u2019t stable. I hope that Senior Meng can show mercy for his rudeness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng FanYun snorted before saying coldly, \u201cMy Above Heavens has hidden in the south-east for four generations and aided your Xiao Family with all of our might. We aided your Xiao Family to rise up from a small insignificant family to a financial magnate capable of influencing the entire continent! Why did we bother doing all that? Isn\u2019t it so that our Above Heavens would be able to regain our status as the number one hidden sect in the world? If not for this, how would your Xiao Family be able to enjoy such favor from my Above Heavens?! I believe that Family Head Xiao is extremely clear about that! Now that the arrow is nocked, you guys still want to protect yourselves and cease battle? How would there be such a nice thing in the world? Since Above Heavens is able to help your Xiao Family to rise up, we can also destroy your Xiao Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan let out an apologetic laugh, \u201cWith Senior\u2019s mystical prowess, FengHan naturally believes in Senior\u2019s capabilities. We will definitely fight this battle. But before that, I have already sent people to Sky Bearing to investigate just what is the Ling Family\u2019s secret weapon. The might of that weapon is too powerful and we have no choice but to guard against it. If we hastily go out to battle and suffer a huge loss, it will be too late to regret it at that time. I believe that Senior Meng already has a plan in your heart so there isn\u2019t a need to continue joking.\u201d He then chuckled.</p><br/><p>Meng FanYun chuckled coldly and said, \u201cSecond Master is someone who understands the art of war. The truth is hidden within the lies and the lies are hidden within the truth. This old man has been rude. I hope that Second Master will not blame me.\u201d He then let go of his grip and took two steps back.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang touched his throat and coughed a couple of times with his face reddened. His throat had already been bruised from Meng FanYun\u2019s grip and after sitting down, he looked at Meng FanYun and forced out a smile, \u201cSenior Meng is too polite. However, such a joke is not something that anyone would be able to endure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng FanYun let out a feigned smile, \u201cSecond Master, you must believe this old man that if there is another time, this joke could become true anytime.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan hurriedly cut in the conversation, \u201cSenior Meng, my second brother and I were just discussing that we should send an envoy to congratulate the Ling Family. This is a good chance to investigate the foundations of the Ling Family. However, I am afraid that second brother may miss out some things. Senior Meng has countless experts under your charge and it would be best if Senior can send a few of your experts to guard second brother in the open while spying on the Ling Family in secret. Apart from the peerless experts in Above Heavens, no one else would be able to accomplish such a mission.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng FanYun looked at Xiao FengYang for a long while before snickering, \u201cThat\u2019s right, how can I be at ease without sending anyone to accompany Second Master? I will naturally send someone to follow Second Master. I hope that everything will go\u2026 smoothly!\u201d He then snorted coldly before leaving the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cOutrageous!\u201d Fire seemed to be spewing out of Xiao FengYang\u2019s eyes as he looked at Meng FanYun\u2019s departing figure with hatred in his eyes. \u201cBig brother, are we going to allow the Above Heavens faction to continue being so arrogant? So what if we gain the world? Can\u2019t you hear it from his words? While he seems to be obeying your words on the surface, his intention of sending men along with me is obviously to spy on me! Above Heavens is truly too unbridled and arrogant. We cannot tolerate them any longer!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if we cannot tolerate them? If we truly become enemies with them, Above Heavens has the strength to easily wipe out our Xiao Family!\u201d Xiao FengHan suppressed his voice and reprimanded, \u201cIt is best for you to watch your words in future and make sure to be more tolerant!\u201d A cold gaze shot out from Xiao FengHan\u2019s eyes as though he made a resolute decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, why did you take the initiative to get old devil Meng to send men to Sky Bearing with me? Aren\u2019t you obviously asking him to spy on me? Could it be that even big brother does not believe in this little brother\u2019s loyalty?!\u201d Xiao FengYang was extremely dissatisfied.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother has misunderstood me. With your intelligence, you should be able to understand that I had no choice but to do so. However, such an arrangement is also for the best. The only way to prevent my Xiao Family from being eradicated is to allow them to watch over you.\u201d Xiao FengHan\u2019s face was chilly. \u201cHowever, you will be the envoy of our party on the trip to Sky Bearing. At that time, you can act at your own discretion!\u201d The last few words were said in a barely audible volume.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang\u2019s eyes lit up and replied, \u201cI understand! I will definitely act carefully.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan chuckled and comforted Xiao FengYang with a pat on the shoulders, \u201cRest assured second brother, while the members of Above Heavens are all martial arts experts and even ten of our Xiao Family members wouldn\u2019t be a match for a single Above Heavens expert, but in terms of politics and schemes, ah ah, you are the true expert in the family.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two brothers looked at each other and burst out laughing together. However, their laughter was filled with a bone-chilling cold and dense killing intent!</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother, follow me. I received a piece of treasure a few days ago. Come take a look at it.\u201d Xiao FengHan said.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang laughed and replied, \u201cI truly want to take a look at big brother\u2019s collections.\u201d The two brothers then walked away together.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The horses were sprinting with the gusting wind welcoming them in the face. Xiao FengYang had a bitter expression on his face. Xiao FengHan\u2019s words echoed in his mind word by word, and the scene of Xiao FengHan frowning flashed by.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother, your current trip to Sky Bearing will determine the survival of our Xiao Family and you have to be more tolerant! The Ling Family is sufficiently powerful and it would be best if we can borrow their strength. We still have some relationship with the Ling Family after all. The only reason why they have not dealt with our Xiao Family over the years is probably because of my big brother and sister-in-law. All these years, I have forgotten their benevolence and truly owe them too much! I no longer have the face to meet them. While I should personally make a trip to the Ling Family to give my apologies, a pity\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember that I had a bet with sister-in-law back then and her words still ring in my ears. In your trip to Sky Bearing, you can help me to inform sister-in-law that I admit my defeat in that bet! I have long known that I lost but I just did not dare to admit it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of our ambitions, we were restrained by Above Heavens and had no room to advance or retreat. Our brotherly ties back then were also harmed because of this and I even gave up the position of little Xue being empress! If not for us annulling the marriage back then, little Xue would be the undisputed empress today! It seems like Xue\u2019er is the one with the greatest foresight in the entire Xiao Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that we have lost the bet, while Xue\u2019er can still be together with Ling Tian, she lost her greatest advantage and will no longer have a chance to become empress. At the very most, she can only be a consort in the future and this is a result of our Xiao Family\u2019s ambitions and selfishness. You can talk to sister-in-law to let Xue\u2019er have her wish and see how big brother and sister-in-law reacts. No matter what, I believe that they will not trouble you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides that, if we can accomplish this matter, our Xiao Family would definitely be facing an even greater danger. Above Heavens is like a cleaver above our neck and we have to get rid of them. You can find Ling Tian for this matter and see if he can aid our Xiao Family in this matter. Haiz, he is probably the only person capable of saving our Xiao Family from this tribulation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe times today are different from the past. I truly regret! I truly regret!\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about the tone of his big brother and desolate profile, Xiao FengYang\u2019s feelings were indescribably complicated!</p><br/><p>The dark clouds approached and a humid wind blew past. The boundless spring rains covered the entire world like the dense mist.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Master, it is raining. Shall we find a place to take shelter from the rain and continue our journey after the rain is over?\u201d Seeing Xiao FengYang lost in his thoughts and not noticing the weather, an Above Heavens expert finally could not help but open his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright then.\u201d Xiao FengYang snapped out of his thoughts and ordered his subordinates blandly. Looking at a young lady beside him, Xiao FengYang said dotingly, \u201cYouHan, how are you? Can you still take it? If you are tired, we can rest for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>This black-robed young lady had bright eyes and white teeth but her face was like a block of ice that rejected everyone miles away. Even when Xiao FengYang was talking to her, her face was still frosty. \u201cI am fine.\u201d She then refused to say another word.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>This young lady was the clan sister of Xiao YanXue, Xiao YouHan. She was one of the few Xiao Family disciples who had the fortune to enter Above Heavens. However, the Xiao Family had actually raised her up as a cold-blooded killer and taught her the art of killing. After a long time, she naturally developed a cold character. Her entire body emanated a dense killing intent that made an individual tremble when approaching her.</p><br/><p>Every time Xiao FengYang saw her, he would let out a sigh. A good lady was trained by Above Heavens into an ice mountain. While the other female disciples were cold, they would not be frosty when facing their family members. However, this Xiao YouHan would not even smile when facing her family members.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang never expected that of the six experts which Above Heavens sent out, Xiao YouHan was also sent. This made the Xiao Family members extremely puzzled.</p><br/><p>Along the way, Xiao FengYang had tried to create small talk with Xiao YouHan, hoping that he would be able to find out the plans of Above Heavens from her. However, he never expected Xiao YouHan\u2019s lips to be completely sealed and her personality to be like a complete block of ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbove Heavens has truly harmed many people!\u201d Looking at this distant granddaughter of his like an ice mountain, Xiao FengYang let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>In Sky Bearing City, the original Sky Bearing imperial palace was being renovated and busy figures could be seen all around.</p><br/><p>With regards to the upcoming ceremony, the three generations of the Ling Family seemed extremely casual about the entire event. Old Master Ling had even instructed, \u201cJust fix the palace up and ensure there are no leaks. There isn\u2019t a need to spend so many resources and money on these houses. What a waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>While the three generations of the Ling Family were casual about the event, how would the various ministers be willing to deal with the matter casually? This was the imperial palace and not some pig sty! This was the pride of the entire empire and no ordinary individuals would be staying there.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian added another condition to the instructions. \u201cYou guys can build the palace as you wish but you must not get a single tael of silver from the commoners.\u201d This condition of his had immediately stumped the various ministers. As such, Ling Jian came up with a brilliant plan and ordered the various ministers to make a donation. He had even taken the initiative to donate all of his assets, a full 36 taels of silver.</p><br/><p>Everyone cursed Ling Jian in their hearts, Isn\u2019t this assassin going too far? Despite guarding a mountain of gold and silver, he still dares to claim that his wealth only consists of 36 taels of silver?</p><br/><p>However, they did not know that Ling Jian truly did not have the slightest bit of silver on him. He even found banknotes a complete burden to have and had already given everything he gained to his young noble. Even the 36 tales of silver that he donated was snatched from the personal stash of Ling Chi.</p><br/><p>All of the old men in the palace were completely helpless. Taking out money? They were penniless. But if they didn\u2019t take any money out, were they going to allow the palace to remain at its current state? All of them could not help but let out a long sigh. Since ancient times, there hadn\u2019t been a single emperor that did not bother about the appearance of the palace. However, there were a total of three now!</p><br/><p>They hated the fact that they did not choose to enter the army back then and chose the wrong path. If they had abandoned their brushes and entered the army back then, they could have gained some fortune from war. How would they be in their current dilemma? Before the empire was established, the salary of the ministers was naturally non-existent. They were all eating into their savings already and would naturally not have any excess money to donate. Even if they had money, they couldn\u2019t bear to donate it either. After all, the palace had nothing to do with them.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s intelligence net had investigated the reactions of all the various ministers and placed their report on top of Ling Tian\u2019s desk. It couldn\u2019t be helped, as Old Master Ling wasn\u2019t willing to bother about anything. He only wanted to be the titular emperor and enjoy his fortune. As for political affairs of the empire, that would be discussed by Ling Xiao and Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao had already sped back to the front lines and refused to return. As such, all the political affairs of the empire were sent to the Ling Family Courtyard!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian went crazy again!</p><br/><p>However, after the donation affair that Ling Jian had stirred up, Ling Tian was extremely satisfied with the results of the investigation. The majority of the ministers were still considered clean. With the strength of Ling Tian\u2019s information net, even the brocade guards from his previous life would probably be incomparable! They managed to investigate all the details without the slightest commotion and they probably knew the number of rats every family had, not to mention having mountains of silver or gold. Their efficiency was truly stunning!</p><br/><p>Of course, there were a few wealthy individuals among the ministers and they were all singled out by the investigations. The former minister of internal affairs was guarding a large mountain of gold that was almost turning moldy. He actually learned to act like an honest official and donated 20 taels of silver while dressed in tattered robes. Before Ling Tian could even say anything, Ling Jian had already led his men to raid the former minister\u2019s house. He had raided more than a hundred thousand taels of silver and a few thousand taels of gold. To think that the former minister even argued that he was only corrupted under Long Xiang\u2019s rule and was completely honest right now. In a fit of rage, Ling Jian cleaved him in two without any mercy.</p><br/><p>As such, before the new emperor had even ascended to the throne, a bunch of memorandums were piled on Ling Tian\u2019s desk criticizing Ling Jian for doing as he wished and his arrogance. Ling Tian immediately had a huge headache! When he called Ling Jian over to question him, Ling Jian had replied with a cool tone, \u201cIf this fellow can climb back out from the gates of hell, I will cleave him in two again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k!\u201d Ling Tian was thoroughly speechless and was completely helpless when facing Ling Jian. Ling Jian was an assassin who he had personally trained. He could only wave Ling Jian away with a long sigh. This imperial throne is truly a hot potato! Will I be able to do as I please and settle my grievances as I like?!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Jian\u2019s thunderous methods also had a stunning effect. During the time when Ling Jian was overseeing the investigations, not a single official dared to engage in any corrupt acts!</p><br/><p>In just a single day, Ling Tian got the talented ladies of his harem to aid him. He then took out a large sum of silver and paid the various officials half a year\u2019s worth of salary. This action of his elated all of the various officials in the empire.</p><br/><p>However, this action of his gave Chu Ting\u2019er and Xiao YanXue a large headache. They dragged Ling Tian before them to reprimand him before nagging at Ling Tian about the lack of money for the next few days. In a fit of rage, Ling Tian immediately summoned Ling Jian over to issue his new instructions. Regardless of whether they were bandits or robbers, there wasn\u2019t a need for any other gifts. Silver and gold would be the best gift and the more the merrier!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian left with his orders and after discussing the matter with Ling Chi, they made contribution ranking list with 50 names on it. The top few on the ranking list were Ling Jian, Ling Chi, Feng, Yun, Lei, and Dian. They had all generously written a number beside their name to set a standard for the others.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian: 5,000,000 taels of silver. Ling Chi: 3,000,000 taels of silver. Ling Feng and the others: 1,000,000 taels of silver each. They then spread the notice out.</p><br/><p>The three continents were immediately sent into a frenzy!</p></div>\n</div>"}

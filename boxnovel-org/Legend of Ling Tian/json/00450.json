Yu ManLou matched Ling Tian\u2019s stab without retreating and continued to charge forward instead. After spinning around to disperse Ling Tian\u2019s inner qi, Yu ManLou was even nearer to Ling Tian. Yu ManLou knew that if he were to slightly let up on his attacks, it would be impossible to capture the two black-masked men tonight!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Ling Tian\u2019s figure which was about to sink back down suddenly began floating up strangely. Following that, a green light that was tied to his body suddenly slipped and fell.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou swiftly twisted his body and caught the green light. Upon coming into contact with the ball of green light, Yu ManLou could feel a tinge of warmth in his palms. It was actually a piece of top-grade warm jade! Furthermore, there was a pulling force as though something was tied onto it.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s drifting figure suddenly approached Yu ManLou rapidly and his sword cleaved down at the empty space between the both of them. Yu ManLou then felt the tugging force disappear completely as though Ling Tian had cut something off. The distance between them was then completely opened up. The force from Yu ManLou\u2019s jump was spent, and he let out a sigh. Just when he was about to make a backflip to land on the ground, Yu ManLou suddenly felt a strong gust of wind approaching him and Ling Tian\u2019s palm strike struck towards his right hand! To think that his opponent would take the initiative to launch an attack!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou sneered and welcomed the palm strike with his own. Only then did he remember that he was still holding onto the jade pendant. He then threw out the jade pendant towards Ling Tian with his full strength. If Ling Tian was to catch the jade pendant, it would be like receiving a full strength palm strike from Yu ManLou. Furthermore, Yu ManLou added some spin to the jade pendant to ensure that it would return to him if Ling Tian avoided it. After sending the jade pendant out, Yu ManLou sent out a palm strike of his own.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yu ManLou looked at his opponent\u2019s gaze and felt that something was wrong. His opponent actually had a trace of delight in his eyes. Why? What was he delighted about? Could it be that he was scheming something?</p><br/><p>Just when Yu ManLou was full of doubts, Ling Tian had actually welcomed his own palm strike without avoiding it at all. After a low grunt, Ling Tian sent out a finger strike and the jade pendant was smashed into pieces with the fragments sent flying in all directions.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou immediately realized that his opponent\u2019s objective was to destroy this piece of jade! Why? Could there be something wrong with this piece of jade?!</p><br/><p>Jade pendant!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou suddenly thought of something and his expression changed drastically!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian didn\u2019t say a single word, and just when he was about to leave with Li Xue\u2019s aid, he realized that there was a small black dot from the exploded jade pendant shooting towards him. Ling Tian quickly caught the black dot and his figure shot towards the sky the next moment.</p><br/><p>While Yu ManLou\u2019s cultivation was extremely profound, it was impossible for him to remain in midair for such a long time. He had no choice but to drift slowly onto the ground. Below him, a powerful gust of wind created by the many weapons shot towards Ling Tian. The eleven top-notch experts of the Yu Family took action together!</p><br/><p>With a few \u2018dang dang dang\u2019 sounds, Ling Tian swiftly deflected all of the weapons and his figure left the Yu Residence. After landing on a tree, both Li Xue and Ling Tian immediately took their leave. By the time the various experts of the Yu Family arrived at the top of the wall, both of their figures had already disappeared into the dark!</p><br/><p>Despite being trapped in the Yu Residence and encircled by the Yu Family\u2019s experts, their enemy actually managed to escape!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s countenance was ashen!</p><br/><p>\u201cGather the broken fragments of that jade and piece them together! Don\u2019t even miss a single piece! I want to have an answer before daybreak!\u201d Yu ManLou issued his command angrily. Upon thinking about how his opponent willingly suffered a palm strike to destroy the piece of jade, Yu ManLou was certain that something was fishy! Perhaps the piece of jade may have a secret!</p><br/><p>While the black-masked figure who arrived later obviously didn\u2019t unleash his full strength, his martial arts were obviously not any much lower than Yu ManLou\u2019s. In the world today, how many people could achieve such a height in their martial arts? Ling Tian? Thinking about that name, Yu ManLou shook his head and chuckled. While Ling Tian was powerful, he should not have reached such heights yet. Even if he were to train from his mother\u2019s womb, it would be difficult for him to achieve such heights.</p><br/><p>When his third brother, Yu ManTian, came back, Yu ManLou had questioned him about Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts in detail. According to Yu ManTian\u2019s description, while Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts were shocking and even better than Yu ManTian, it definitely wasn\u2019t by a huge margin. Together with him personally witnessing Ling Tian\u2019s performance on the battlefield, Yu ManLou had a good estimation in his heart. Based on Ling Tian\u2019s age, the cultivation that he had displayed was already considered astounding and he was definitely a once in a thousand years genius. However, Ling Tian was definitely far from being a match with this black-masked individual!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, from the way Yu ManTian described Ling Tian, Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts should belong to the pure Yang path which was obviously different from this black-masked individual. If that\u2019s the case, it was obvious which power this black-masked man belonged to!</p><br/><p>Thinking about the few clashes with the black-masked man and the familiar feeling, Yu ManLou fell into a deep consideration. In their few exchanges, the black-masked man had split his inner qi into a few different waves and his attack was like the never-ending waves of an ocean.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, this was not the only feeling Yu ManLou felt. When Yu ManLou exchanged palm strikes with the black-masked man, he felt as though he was in the waters and couldn\u2019t plant his feet firmly on the ground.</p><br/><p>His opponent\u2019s martial arts obviously belonged to the soft and gentle path but yet seemed to be hiding something\u2026</p><br/><p>The coverup only made it more obvious!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou snorted and a chilly gaze shot out from his eyes. Do you really think that I am a fool?</p><br/><p>However, just what was the item that aided their escape? Even if a rope was tied to his waist, it should be obvious and impossible to hide from his eyes. Furthermore, just how thin could a rope be that could hold two people? Despite that, he just wasn\u2019t able to spot the rope!</p><br/><p>From today onward, they would have to guard against the brutal revenge of the First Pavilion! Thinking about that, Yu ManLou couldn\u2019t help but let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head.\u201d The eleven subdivision heads gathered together with their faces flushed red in embarrassment. Under the encirclement of almost all the Yu Family\u2019s experts, not only was many of their men injured, their enemy had escaped! All of them were completely embarrassed and infuriated! It was as though someone had slapped them on the face. The Pavilion Head of the Firmament Charging Pavilion held onto his foster brother\u2019s corpse with hatred in his bloodshot eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cComparing martial arts, there are at least four of you above the First Pavilion Head. Comparing numbers, we were far superior.\u201d Yu ManLou sighed and said solemnly, \u201cDespite having such an overwhelming advantage, we still allowed the enemy to escape. Do all of you feel embarrassed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Guilt could be seen on all of their faces, and they lowered their heads.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been too peaceful for too long and problems are inevitable.\u201d Yu ManLou remarked gloomily, \u201cThankfully, we weren\u2019t completely destroyed this time. Everyone should continue to work hard and the time will come soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s faces changed and they knelt down. \u201cMay Family Head punish us.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet up!\u201d Yu ManLou let out a sigh and shook his head, \u201cI am very disappointed.\u201d He then turned his back to them all and left. While he wasn\u2019t able to capture the two people, it was still a good thing to give his subordinates a good warning through this incident. The moment his subordinates felt that they were number one in the world, they would eventually suffer a huge loss! After this lesson, all of his subordinates should be more careful and it would definitely be a good thing for them in the upcoming war.</p><br/><p>Not too long later, Yu ManLou\u2019s voice sounded, \u201cCarry out the extermination plan that we had discussed earlier on! Search the whole city! Send the jade piece into my study after it is pieced together! I don\u2019t want to see a single fragment missing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone felt their heart tremble and acknowledged in unison. They knew that their Family Head was truly enraged by the event tonight. They had never seen their Family Head lose his cool as such for more than ten years. If the extermination mission didn\u2019t satisfy the Family Head, all of their good lives would definitely be over. Thinking about the possible punishment they might face from their Family Head, everyone couldn\u2019t help but tremble slightly.</p><br/><p>Everyone had yet to leave and a white-dressed individual rushed out hastily. After giving a bow, he said, \u201cThe Family Head instructed for the Vice Pavilion Head\u2019s family to be brought into the Yu Residence and taken care of by the family. As for his funeral, the Pavilion Head and Head Deacon should be in charge of it, and the Family Head will be there. From today onwards, if anyone dares to humiliate the Vice Pavilion Head\u2019s family, they will be executed without mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI thank the Family Head for his benevolence!\u201d Everyone felt regret, hatred, and gratitude in their hearts as they thought, If we were to fail in our mission despite the Family Head treating us so well, we are better off dead! Yu ZhanFeng was touched to the point tears filled his face and even if Yu ManLou were to command him to die right now, he would definitely carry out that order!</p><br/><p>However, none of them knew that after Yu ManLou entered his study, he slammed the table and roared, \u201cWater! Of! Heavenly! Wind!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Yu ManLou couldn\u2019t help but be filled with doubts.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that the First Pavilion\u2019s partner is actually the Shui Family? Furthermore, the second black-masked figure definitely had exceptional martial arts but was restraining himself to hide something. However, I have accumulated many records of the Shui Family\u2019s martial arts over the many years and that black-masked figure\u2019s martial arts obviously walked the soft and flexible path. How could such martial arts be so easily hidden?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

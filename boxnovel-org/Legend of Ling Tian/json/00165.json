His head which was originally stretched out proudly retracted back into his neck, and the words he wanted to say were swallowed.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou let out a grunt and said with a solemn gaze, \u201cThird brother, I am going to say this once more. While profound martial arts can solve many problems in the world, not everything in the world can be solved by martial arts. The only reason why Beyond Heavens is so powerful and a head above the rest is because of the logic of not fighting. This is something which all the other powers are not able to do. The reason why our Yu Family is incomparable to Beyond Heavens is because we will have to fight eventually! So, I do not want to hear you underestimating or slandering Beyond Heavens. Furthermore, this is also the same with Ling Tian \u2014 you can treat him with contempt, but you must never underestimate or ignore him. Do you really know his true strength? You must never let your guard down against an unknown enemy! Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian then nodded his head obediently in response. While he still looked unconvinced, he did not say another word.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou then looked at Yu ManTang and said, \u201cSecond brother, you know about Ling Tian as well. Do you really think that things are so simple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang hesitated for a moment before replying, \u201cBig brother, I am extremely worried about BingYan\u2026 After all, for Wei ChengPing to send men to the Sky Bearing City, his main motive will probably be BingYan. Regardless of how the situation in the Sky Bearing City is, I want to make a trip there.\u201d As he said that, he looked towards Yu ManLou with a resolute gaze, \u201cBingYan is my only daughter, but she contracted an incurable disease since young and do not have much time left. I do not want to let my daughter experience anymore hurt in her short and miserable life! I also wish to fulfil all of her wishes as far as possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou became silent for a moment before letting out a long sigh, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, I will write a personal letter to Ling Tian, and get the Second Elder to send it personally. As long as our Yu Family doesn\u2019t participate in this matter, I believe that Ling Tian will still show our Yu Family some face. He is a smart person, and the Yu Family is not something which he is able to offend presently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang broke out into a smile and was finally at ease, \u201cThank you, big brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou then frowned, \u201cWithout a doubt, this matter was definitely planned by Ling Tian! While I still do not know what his true motive is, I am very sure that he has his own plans! For him to boldly approach BingYan, I believe he wants to use her as bait to drag our Yu Family in because of concern.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he began to relax for a bit, \u201cNow that our Yu Family isn\u2019t involved in the whole affair, all of his plans are useless against us. So, he has no choice but to give us some face! But if our Yu Family really involve ourselves in this matter, he may not even place me in his sights!\u201d</p><br/><p>While he said that, a mysterious smile could be seen on Yu ManLou\u2019s face as he thought to himself, \u201cBrat, you are still trying to test us, right? This old man will tell you that I have already found out about your existence. The eyesight of this old man is definitely much better than most others. This time, it is my turn to watch by the side to witness your true strength; at the very least, a portion of your true strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>That very night, a black figure stealthily left the residence of the Yu Family with Yu ManLou\u2019s handwritten letter! A short while later, another figure left the residence at high speed and disappeared into the darkness.</p><br/><p>Dawn, in Yu ManLou\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Yu ManLou questioned with a fiery gaze as he looked at the Second Elder in front of him, \u201cThird brother took the letter from you? He went to Sky Bearing alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>The white-haired Second Elder was startled, \u201cThat\u2019s right. First, Third Master said that it was your intention. For this trip to the Sky Bearing City, there must be someone with sufficient competence to take charge of the matters there! He then gave a strict order for me to not follow him. Since this old man cannot defy him, I can only come back to report this matter to you. Second\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As the old man gave his explanation, his moustache was also twirled up from anger. That brash fellow is obviously trying to say that I am not competent enough! In what way is this old man not competent? In the eyes of the Family Head, is this old man incomparable to that fool who is foolishly in love with martial arts? While\u2026</p><br/><p>For him to report the matter back, half of it was because of his suspicions and the other half was because of indignance. At the same time, his words were also a way to question the Family Head, \u201cNo matter what, this old man is still one of the elders in the Yu Family! My martial arts can also be considered to be the middle white jade class, and I will not lose out to anyone else in shrewdness. In what way am I incomparable to that martial arts fanatic? Even if you are biased towards your own younger brother, your words are far too crude! Besides, from the perspective of the family, we should definitely not send a brash fellow who does not know how to scheme at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard! Unable to accomplish anything but always spoiling my plans!\u201d Yu ManLou almost fainted from anger! He only wanted to send the Second Elder there to drop the letter and return immediately! They must definitely not take part in the affairs of the Sky Bearing City for sure! Furthermore, this was also a way for him to demonstrate his prowess to Ling Tian and give him a warning.</p><br/><p>Besides that, regardless of how the matters in the Sky Bearing City turns out, as long as his Yu Family does not appear, Ling Tian will definitely be warier in future! Yu ManLou will then be able to achieve his goal of impeding Ling Tian! Even if Ling Tian becomes the biggest victor, he would not be able to achieve complete victory.</p><br/><p>The moment Yu ManTian goes there, the situation would be completely different! While Yu ManTian plays no part in running the family, he was still one of the heavyweights in the Yu Family! Regardless of whether he brings men with him or not, his appearance in the Sky Bearing City would signify the participation of their Yu Family! If Ling Tian, or anyone else, made use of Yu ManTian\u2019s rash personality to create trouble, their Yu Family will no longer be able to stay out of the mess!</p><br/><p>With Ling Tian\u2019s top-notch wisdom, how would he let go of this chance given by the heavens?! Regardless of how profound his third brother\u2019s cultivation was, he was still like a bull in a china shop! If someone wanted to make use of him, how would he be able to avoid that?!</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother Yu! You, you, you\u2026 you are really going to anger me to death!\u201d Yu ManLou flew into an outrage and let out a loud roar! Ever since he became the head of the Yu Family, this was the first time he flew into such an outrage! He really felt heartache at the actions of his third brother.</p><br/><p>The familial ties within the Yu Family was extraordinarily strong and this was something which cannot be seen in the other Great Families. Because of his anxiousness from concern, he\u2026</p><br/><p>The second elder lowered his head without saying a word, but was secretly relieved in his heart, \u201cSo it was that rash fellow making his own decisions! But with that rash fellow\u2019s martial arts, there shouldn\u2019t be any problem, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a loud \u201cPeng!\u201d, the red sandalwood table in front of him was reduced to dust! Yu ManLou then stood up and paced around the room with his brows furrowed.</p><br/><p>The Second Elder was startled as he thought to himself, \u201cThe Family Head usually conceals himself very well. I never expected his Inner Qi to be developed to such a profound level! It seems that his is already at the middle gold jade class! So, it isn\u2019t just third brother Yu\u2026 even the Family Head has reached such a profound level! I should probably just keep all my other thoughts and just mind my own business!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, Family Head do not need to be so worried. Third Master achieved another breakthrough in his martial arts recently, and this old man is incomparable to him. If Family Head isn\u2019t at ease, this old man can gather a few experts and rush to the Sky Bearing City through the night to aid Third Master.\u201d Knowing that it wasn\u2019t Yu ManLou\u2019s intention to revoke his mission, the anger of the Second Elder was quickly appeased. Instead, he began to worry for Yu ManTian! This was the Yu Family! If such a thing happened in any other family, it would definitely not be settled so peacefully.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s face was calm as he paced around the room twice. After a long while, he said, \u201cForget it! For him to go alone, we will still be able to salvage the situation if something happens to him. But if we were to send more men there, it may only cause more chaos! It would also be a good thing to let third brother suffer a bit! At the very most, no one would dare to take his life with our Yu Family as his backing! Besides that, the letter in his hands would be his best protective talisman when it is sent to Ling Tian\u2019s hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>In Yu ManLou\u2019s heart, the gathering of all powers in the Sky Bearing City cannot be a mere coincidence! It must definitely be arranged by someone! This person can only be him and Yu ManLou had never suspected anyone else!</p><br/><p>Apart from the little fellow, Ling Tian, who he had never been able to see through, it was impossible for anyone else to lay out such a plan! Although Yu ManLou was uncertain about Ling Tian\u2019s motives, he had long made a decision in his heart! Because he was uncertain, Yu ManLou was extremely cautious! He would never step into that little fellow\u2019s plan rashly! But for his third brother to go to the Sky Bearing City, it was equivalent to his own Yu Family stepping into the mess! This made Yu ManLou feel as though he had just lost the upper hand. While it wasn\u2019t his error, he was still extremely depressed!</p><br/><p>However, it was also for the same reason that Yu ManLou wasn\u2019t worried about Yu ManTian. As long as Ling Tian was the one running the scene in the background, Ling Tian would definitely not kill Yu ManTian at the risk of offending the whole Yu Family! Even if the other powers wanted to do so, Ling Tian would definitely stop them! Thus, there was no need to doubt Yu ManTian\u2019s safety at all!</p><br/><p>After thinking things through, Yu ManLou let out a long sigh as he lifted up his head to the white clouds and muttered, \u201cThird brother! When can you make me not worry about you? Since you love martial arts, isn\u2019t it enough for you to just spend your time studying it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Second Elder stood by the side and heard Yu ManLou mumbling to himself. Then, he thought about something, \u201cFamily Head, this old man forgot to report something important to you. Third Master\u2019s martial arts had already advanced into the gold jade class. The speed of his improvement is really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Yu ManLou thought about the matter for a while before saying, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then\u2026 ah ah ah, it may be a good move for third brother to go there!\u201d Yu ManLou suddenly seemed to be at ease as he revealed a mysterious smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

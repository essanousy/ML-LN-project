The both of them made Chu Ting\u2019er as well as Ling Chen so heartbroken that they kept crying.</p><br/><p>The two women were completely puzzled, just what was wrong with the two of them? They would hardly exchange a word for months, and now they\u2019re suddenly drinking wine together like best buddies? And they even got themselves drunk!</p><br/><p>Recalling their expressions, Chu Ting\u2019er and Ling Chen were fuming, yet secretly found it funny.</p><br/><p>Just when both of them started to see double, Ling Xiao had suddenly performed a military salute, before speaking.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao patted Ling Tian on his shoulder, staring at him with his drunken eyes, \u201cNot bad, urrrppp, brother, you\u2019re not bad at all. This elder brother really\u2026 looks up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was equally in a mess, replying, \u201cWhat\u2019s that nonsense\u2026 We\u2019re brothers, why should we look up to each other. Come, cheers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao: \u201cToday\u2019s wine\u2026 tastes good to this elder brother! I\u2019ll drink my fill!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian: \u201cHmph! This wine\u2026 This younger brother has much of it\u2026 drink as much as you want!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao: \u201cHahaha\u2026 brother is really\u2026 easy-going\u2026 later, give this brother\u2026 some\u2026 of your wine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smacked his chest: \u201cNo\u2026 no problem!\u201d</p><br/><p>Listening to their antics, the entire great hall went into hysterics. Old Madam Ling laughed so hard she coughed out the wine that she just drank; while Chu Ting\u2019er spat out the mouth of wine she had just taken onto Ling Chen, leaving her dripping wet. Ling Chen was laughing so hard she had unknowingly upended her cup, spilling the wine all over the table\u2026</p><br/><p>Even the moody and depressed Ling Zhan couldn\u2019t help but crack out a smile, kicking Ling Xiao\u2019s body, \u201cD*mn you b*st*rd! What nonsense are you spouting? He\u2019s your son!\u201d However, due to Ling Xiao\u2019s sturdy build, coupled with his drunken state, this kick had totally no feeling, only managing to knock him off his chair where he immediately started snoring on the floor\u2026.</p><br/><p>When the rest turned to Ling Tian, they unexpectedly found out that he had long planted his handsome face into a bowl of fish soup, steadily and slowing breathing\u2026 this was definitely the highest stage of drunkenness; silently fading into darkness\u2026</p><br/><p>On the journey back previously, both father and son had a long talk about a lot of issues and had opened up to each other. Both were equally pleased; the son thought that having such a father was a blessing to him, while the father felt that having such a son was a matter to be proud of! Thus they were very happy and ended up drinking a little more than expected.</p><br/><p>However, on the morning of the second day, the happiness between the two was broken!</p><br/><p>Because he was too happy, Ling Tian had brought out his own wines for the banquet. The men were given the Luna Fragrance and Hero\u2019s Blood, while the women drank the Maiden\u2019s Heart. Everyone indulged in the heavenly wines.</p><br/><p>However, on the morning of the next day, after freshening up, Ling Tian had, as per normal, sat under the grape racks to meditate and recuperate. In a moment, Ling Xiao strolled in, impolitely opening his mouth and saying, \u201cSon, those wines that you took out last night, give your old man another thousand jars. I\u2019m thinking of bringing them to the army for the lads to enjoy them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne\u2026 ONE THOUSAND??!!\u201d Ling Tian jumped up as though he was a cat that just had its tail stepped on, even his voice went up by an octave, \u201cFather, do you think this is a mountain pebble? One thousand jars, even if you behead me I can\u2019t take out that much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Such good wine, it\u2019s good that I even let you gorge yourself at home for free, but to think you want to bring it over to the barracks to reward your soldiers! And to think you ask for a thousand jars the moment you open your mouth! Ling Tian thought in fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then five hundred jars should do; that settles it.\u201d Ling Xiao also felt that a thousand was pushing it and generously reduced it to half.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t even have five jars, let alone five hundred!\u201d Ling Tian snorted in anger. To think that he was so touched that he broke into tears yesterday, but how come he reverted to his old ways so soon?</p><br/><p>\u201cB*ast*rd!\u201d Ling Xiao also flared up. \u201cHow many do you still have? Take them all out for your old man!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are only two left.\u201d Ling Tian nimbly drew out two jars, and spreading out his hands, he put on the attitude of a hoodlum. \u201cI don\u2019t have any left. Not even a drop. If you want it, just take it. Else the deal is off.\u201d Want to take my wine to give to the troops of that dogsh*t emperor? Forget about it!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little brat, do you think that you\u2019ve all grown up now?\u201d Ling Xiao grabbed onto Ling Tian\u2019s collar with a hand, sneering in anger, \u201cIf this old man doesn\u2019t beat you up today, you probably won\u2019t know I\u2019m your father! I\u2019ve raised you for so many years, but you are calculating with me over a few jars of wine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the two of them were about to come to blows, Ling Chen stood by the side worrying helplessly, but she couldn\u2019t do a thing. On the other hand, Yu BingYan was curiously looking at her prospective father-in-law with a look of disbelief on her face as she spoke, \u201cSister Chen, that\u2019s Ling Tian\u2019s father, the Sky Bearing God of War? Ling Xiao?! Grand Marshall Ling?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 yes, yes he is, haiz!\u201d Ling Chen tried to divert the topic but failed, and could only admit it. She couldn\u2019t help but feel embarrassed for Ling Tian. Between family members it would be fine, but you just had to do it with two of your future daughters-in-law spectating by the side; in the future, how are you going to be a fatherly figure? This was the saying, \u2018throwing away your face, throwing it all the way outside your country\u2019!</p><br/><p>Seeing that the situation was not in his favor, Ling Tian immediately wriggled free and made a break for it. Ling Xiao hesitated for a while, eventually picking up the two jars of wine and chasing after him, hollering all the while. Just like that, the Ling Residence was plunged into chaos in the early morning.</p><br/><p>The chase of the father and the running of the son finally caught the attention of all the higher ups!</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling and Chu Ting\u2019er immediately came out to put a stop to it. After asking about the situation, they immediately berated Ling Xiao and severely warned Ling Tian never to hand over any of his wines to Ling Xiao, ever! Ling Xiao was only allowed to drink a few cups during celebratory occasions, and even had to go through approval by Old Madam Ling! Ling Tian was all smiles when he heard that, nodding his head repeatedly like a hen pecking for food.</p><br/><p>As for Chu Ting\u2019er, she was even crueler. She immediately wrestled the two jars of wine away that Ling Xiao was holding in his bosom, making him so heartbroken he kept grinding his teeth. However, he had no say in this matter, and could only stare.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had obtained an overwhelming victory this time. Just as he was delightedly going back to his little courtyard, a servant rushed up to them. \u201cReporting to Old Madam, Sire, Madam and the Young Noble! The XiMen family has sent an invitation over!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling glanced drily at Ling Tian, \u201cProbably some mess you created, right? Go solve it yourself.\u201d She then dragged Chu Ting\u2019er, together with the two jars of wine and left the scene.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao stared wistfully at the two jars being taken away and could only let out a long sigh. Seeing that the servant was staring at him, he snapped, \u201cWhoever created the trouble should go solve it, so why are you looking at me!\u201d After which he stared daggers at Ling Tian, \u201cLittle brat, you wait for this old man, see how I take care of you!\u201d Then he walked away looking like a rooster which was just defeated!</p><br/><p>However, this phrase of Grand Marshall Ling had been repeated for at least a few hundred times, but he never carried it out once!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could only bitterly laugh and accept the invitation.</p><br/><p>Returning to his little courtyard, a faint smile hung on his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, what are you so happy about?\u201d Ling Chen asked as she approached him with Yu BingYan in tow. Yesterday, the two ladies had fled like frightened rabbits back into the carriage when they had heard the pitiful wailings and did not see the actual bloody scenario, so their mental states were particularly good. This was especially so for Yu BingYan, who considered herself privy to the internal matters of the Ling Family, and could already be considered approved by the Lings, thus she was in her own land of happiness.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s because of this. Take a look.\u201d Ling Tian passed over the invite, and the two ladies huddled closer, craning their necks to take a look.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 thus all talented heroes under heavens, converge like bright gems;</p><br/><p>the golden opportunity of a lifetime goes to them.</p><br/><p>Taking step by step for a thousand miles, boiling tea at Smoky Thea;</p><br/><p>how much of a pleasure it would be if all heroes were to swap sword for pen to challenge me!</p><br/><p>I\u2019ve long heard that young noble is well-versed scholarly, and creative in wit, truly a talent of Sky Bearing! If I could get the young noble to grace me with his presence, and exhibit your graceful demeanor, I believe this scholarly meet would be enriched by twofold! Young Noble has a refined temperament, which leaves us desiring to raise our heads to look at you as well as to hear your poetry! Yours Sincerely, Junior XiMen Qing!\u201d Ling Chen read out loud, and before she had finished reading, both the ladies\u2019 eyes were already shining!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey! Brother Tian, it\u2019s a scholarly meet! Let\u2019s go let\u2019s go!\u201d Yu BingYan immediately stepped forward, grabbing onto Ling Tian\u2019s arm and swinging it back and fro. \u201cI really want to see all the literary experts gather together and see how much poetry they can write that will be passed down for eternity!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen, whose hand was clutching onto the invite, also smiled sweetly at Ling Tian, the desire in her eyes apparent.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could only shake his head helplessly. He already predicted that the scholarly meeting would be a hard to resist temptation for the two ladies, and he was right! He couldn\u2019t help but think, Seems like poetry and songwriting are popular no matter which world we\u2019re in. No wonder those main characters from reincarnation books can have droves of females throwing themselves at them with just a sentence! Wait a minute\u2026 does that mean that this young noble can also give it a try\u2026? Heheheheheheheh! Stroking his chin, he began to wickedly smile to himself. The two ladies by his side immediately got the goosebumps when they saw his smile!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

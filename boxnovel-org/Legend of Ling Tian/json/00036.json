This whole matter was created from a moment of his anger and thus could not be blamed on others.</p><br/><p>A brief spell of depression struck him as his eyes wandered around. Seemingly feeling as though something was missing, it suddenly struck him as his face turned frosty and he raged, \u201cWhere\u2019s your darling grandson?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Zhan was also puzzled for a while; he just saw the little fellow not too long ago, how did he disappear in a blink of an eye? Carrying some suspicions, he looked towards Ling Xiao, \u201cWhere did Tian\u2019er go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Kong, who was standing by the side, was rejoicing in their misfortune. At such an important scene, that good for nothing was actually not at the scene! Was this not looking for trouble?</p><br/><p>As both the Ling father and son were tongue tied, an old man wearing a green robe hurriedly walked out from the inner courtyard, \u201cHahaha, I heard the Xiao family\u2019s great chariot is here, so this old man shamelessly came to welcome you too. After so many years, I trust the Xiao family head is still well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan took a glance, and received a shock and asked as he hurriedly stepped forward to meet him, \u201cBrother Qin? Why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Both Ling father and son rejoiced inwardly and took this chance to bring the various guests into the reception hall of the Ling residence. Ling Zhan gave a look to the attendant behind him, causing him to hurriedly sneak away to find Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>Mister Qin was shaking hands while chatting happily with Xiao FengHan, looking as though they were bosom friends.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan purposefully walked slower than the rest, and as the crowd started to pull away from them, he pulled Mister Qin\u2019s hand and said, \u201cBrother Qin, this Xiao has a matter to consult you with. Please stay with me.\u201d The black robed bodyguards all knew that their family head had something to consult Mister Qin with, and all of them surrounded the two of them from the view of the crowd, without so much as a single sound being made.</p><br/><p>Mister Qin of course knew the reason as to why he was being held back. Subconsciously, he gained a whole new level of respect for the frightening intellect that Ling Tian held. This little fellow could actually predict the steps Xiao FengHan would take and moreover, without the slightest amount of deviation! How many mortals in the area under the heavens could achieve that?</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan whispered, \u201cSince Brother Qin is tutoring here, this Xiao shall get straight to the point. Can I know how the Ling young master is like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, it came! Mister Qin gave a laugh inside, but his facial expressions were wondrous to behold. While shaking his head, his face changed constantly, from shame to disbelief and a sad sigh, finally speaking in a pained tone, \u201cAi! Brother Xiao, I will not hide from you anything. For this matter, it\u2019s hard to explain in just a few words! Based on this Qin\u2019s knowledge, I\u2019m ashamed to be his teacher!\u201d Shaking his head some more, his face looked as though he was about to burst into tears!</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan\u2019s face turned cold as he slowly spoke, \u201cIf you say it like this, then what I\u2019ve heard from the grapevine definitely has some form of truth! Luckily, this old man came a few years earlier! Or else\u2026\u201d the latter could not help but feel a sense of fright.</p><br/><p>Mister Qin was tongue-tied. Ling Tian had long guessed what Xiao FengHan\u2019s reaction upon hearing the rumors would be. Now that the person in question opened his mouth, to think it was as though he was repeating from a script that Ling Tian had crafted, with the most difficult part being that not one word deviated from the original one by Ling Tian! It was as though a parrot was mimicking. In order to hide the smile that threatened to surface, Mister Qin\u2019s mouth curved to a strange angle. In his heart, a wave of hooting laughter flooded up, threatening to explode out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>Whatever Mister Qin had said was apparently right but wrong for different types of people who heard it as they would have different interpretations! In actual fact, Mister Qin was speaking the truth; he was indicating that his knowledge was insufficient, being his teacher in vain. But his words, upon entering Xiao FengHan\u2019s ears, based on his first impression, he would definitely come out with a completely different reasoning.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan snorted once, before flicking aside his sleeve as he walked towards the great hall. Mister Qin could not help but cough a few times softly before falling into step behind him.</p><br/><p>The great hall was already a mass of activity. The womenfolk had long left, only leaving Madam Ling holding onto the hands of a little girl, affectionately huddling together, not knowing what they were saying.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan came over with a black face. Glancing around the hall, he found out that the young master of the Ling family had yet to make his appearance even till now. This caused him to be even unhappier, calling out deeply, \u201cXue\u2019er, come to grandfather\u2019s side.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl, Xiao YanXue, gave a sound of acknowledgement, and climbed down from Madam Ling\u2019s embrace using both her hands, before skipping and jumping towards her grandfather\u2019s side. Her mouth seemed to be chewing on something, as she stretched out that jade-like white wrist of hers as though to present a treasure, \u201cGrandfather, look, this is the present from Madam Ling to me!\u201d It was actually a jasper bracelet, looking pure and clear as water without the slightest hint of impurities. A blood red phoenix could be seen vividly on the bracelet surface, following the movements of the bracelet, as though it wanted to break through and soar off.</p><br/><p>A look from Xiao FengHan told him that the Blood Phoenix was in no way embedded into it, but rather, naturally formed. Such a treasure was hard to obtain even with ten thousand gold, but Madam Ling actually casually gave it away to his granddaughter! Obviously, she had already treated her as she would with her daughter-in-law! Thinking about this, Xiao FengHan could not help but let out an agonized smile.</p><br/><p>As for the bracelet, Xiao FengHan naturally understood that this was the heirloom of the Ling family, the \u201cBlood Phoenix Jasper Bracelet\u201d, and its price was beyond compare, treated as a priceless treasure. Wearing it would cause a person to always be calm and collected, indeed a treasure without rival! Xiao FengHan could not help but stutter, thinking to himself, Looks like I have to really sever through the tangled hemp quickly, or else it will reach the route of no return.</p><br/><p>Outside the hall, the voice of a guard travelled over, \u201cYoung master, please follow this little one along, the sire has already been waiting for quite a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following which, the melodious sound of a child erupted in violent fury, \u201cBastard! You dog slave, are you looking to die? I told you long ago not to call me Young Master! Get the f**k lost! What\u2019s so good about seeing that old Xiao? I\u2019d rather go feed the birds!\u201d This was followed with a \u201cpu!\u201d sound, presumably from the servant enduring a beating from the young master.</p><br/><p>In that moment, the audience in the hall all had wondrous expressions to behold! It was so silent, you could hear a pin drop!</p><br/><p>Both Ling Zhan and Xiao FengHan wore a face of black lines, so full of rage that it was on the verge of spilling out.</p><br/><p>Old madam Ling was about to bring a cup of tea to her mouth, yet upon hearing the sentence, the teacup ended up falling to the floor, smashing into bits! Her eyes were filled with disbelief as she looked at the entrance.</p><br/><p>Even Mister Qin, who had known that Ling Tian would perform a \u201cmiraculous feat\u201d today, did not expect such a dominant and aggressive play, and his eyes opened wide as bells!</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao was apoplectic with rage, and with a bellow, his body shot forward as though he was flying. This was followed by a series of slapping sounds, before a little child\u2019s crying could be heard. This was closely followed by Ling Xiao returning, holding on to a bruised and battered Ling Tian! From Ling Tian\u2019s face, one could see that his beating was not light, and both his cheeks were swollen.</p><br/><p>With a swing, Ling Xiao threw his child onto the floor, yet still breathing heavily. Although Ling Zhan opened his mouth a little, he concluded that this was not the appropriate place to discipline his grandchild, and only bellowed out, \u201cUnfilial creature! Why haven\u2019t you come up to pay respects to your grandfather Xiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laboriously standing up limb by limb, Ling Tian was cursing in his heart: This time, your father, I, was conveniently so viciously hit! Rubbing his huge swelling on his once delicate face, he saw that the great hall now had an extra stranger dressed in green robes, carrying a beautiful little girl in his bosom. The stranger gave an expression as though he was about to eat him alive when he saw him. He was most likely the Xiao family\u2019s head, XIio FengHan.</p><br/><p>Wiping off the tears that he had forcefully squeezed out, he strode towards Xiao FengHan. Just when the crowd thought that he was about to pay his respects to Xiao FengHan, Ling Tian suddenly gave a sound of exclamation, then turned his eyesight while increasing his pace, saying, \u201cWah! This lass is my wife right? Heh heh heh, she is so pretty, come come, let me give you a kiss! Wahahaha\u2026\u201d The audience was petrified! Such a scene made people not want to look on, unable to withstand such a wicked behavior from such a young child.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan was so angry that his entire body started to tremble, and he could not wait to punch that jerk to death with one blow right there and then! He hollered in anger, \u201cScram!\u201d The little girl, Xiao YanXue, was so frightened that she turned tail and threw herself into her grandfather\u2019s embrace, not daring to show her face again.</p><br/><p>Grandpa Ling nearly died there and then due to his anger. Gritting his teeth, he spoke, \u201cEvil creature, Ling Xiao! Bring the family law book for this old man! Today, I shall cleanse the house!\u201d</p><br/><p>The boiling Ling Xiao who was about to move forward to deal with his son suddenly had a change in his expression, stopping in his steps! The originally deathly white face of old madam Ling suddenly trembled as she screamed: \u201cYou dare!\u201d She dashed down and grabbed Ling Tian into her bosom, saying, \u201cTian\u2019er is still small! At such a small age, what can he know? How can you subject him to the family law?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Zhan bristled up his beard and said, \u201cStill small? All of you used to keep saying so, but look at what pampering the child has brought to you! Even if this old man will be deprived of descendants, I shall take care of this little bastard today! Move aside!\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

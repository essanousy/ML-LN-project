His cultivation was fully activated and ready to take action at any moment. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but have praise in his heart.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was actually able to maintain his composure up until now and there wasn\u2019t a single fluctuation in his aura. Such concealment techniques and such accomplishment in his temperament were something extremely rare. If one wanted to achieve great things, staying calm was extremely important and victory would only be achieved when one stayed calm. This was something that Yu ManLou had always believed in. In the younger generation, Yu ManLou had never witnessed someone who was this capable in controlling himself before.</p><br/><p>However, he also knew that daybreak was the final chance for Ling Tian to escape! The moment the sun was up in the sky, it would be impossible for Ling Tian to escape the encirclement of his many experts unless he had martial arts like Justice! However, if Ling Tian had such martial arts, he would have long escaped regardless of daylight or night time! Who would dare to block him? Who would be capable of blocking him?!</p><br/><p>Thinking about his own two sons, Yu ManLou couldn\u2019t help but burn in anger. As compared to Ling Tian, his two sons were completely useless! He couldn\u2019t help but lament in his heart, Why can\u2019t such an outstanding individual be my son? What right does an idiot like Ling Xiao have to give birth to such an outstanding son?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian who was supposed to be extremely anxious remained calm and steady. He knew that growing flustered would only worsen his situation!</p><br/><p>He was waiting!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was waiting for a chance and a time! This time was something that Yu ManLou would never know regardless of how wise and capable he was!</p><br/><p>That was the darkness before daybreak!</p><br/><p>The final few minutes before daybreak was the darkest point in the night. While it was only an extremely short period of time, all of the darkness in the night would be gathered to unleash their final burst. While it was only a short few minutes and the sun would be out after those few minutes, these few minutes were more than sufficient for Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>It was enough for him to escape his current predicament!</p><br/><p>In fact, Ling Tian only needed a short few seconds! Thus, Ling Tian was fully confident in his ability to escape!</p><br/><p>In the distance, a bright firework suddenly exploded and it was the emergency signal of the Yu Family.</p><br/><p>Everyone immediately noticed this situation and while they were under their Family Head\u2019s orders to remain still, they couldn\u2019t help but look over with puzzlement.</p><br/><p>All of them had the same question in their heart. Why was their Family Head so certain that the other party was still around? Didn\u2019t they just search the place thoroughly? Could it be that they were all useless?! If they were to wait for daybreak and realize that they had waited the whole night for nothing, wouldn\u2019t their Yu Family become a huge laughingstock?</p><br/><p>However, how would any of them dare to voice their opinions in the face of Yu ManLou\u2019s prestige? The majority of them did indeed feel this way. Now that they witnessed the emergency signal of their Yu Family, all of the Pavilion Heads were extremely eager to make a move as the same thought surfaced in their head: Wouldn\u2019t it be great if they could make use of this opportunity to leave? If things were just like how they had guessed and they end up waiting for nothing, their Family Head would lose face for sure and all of them would end up in a difficult situation.</p><br/><p>What the eye doesn\u2019t see, the heart doesn\u2019t grieve over!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Yu ChaoRan was already filled with anxiety in his heart and was eager to find out what had happened afar. Could it be that second young noble made a move towards third young noble? My little ancestor, please don\u2019t make a rash move, or you will be killing me!</p><br/><p>Before anyone could open their mouths to seek an instruction, they heard Yu ManLou\u2019s calm voice, \u201cNone of you are allowed to say a thing or make a move! Anyone who moves will be killed without mercy! There will be no exceptions!\u201d As he said that, he looked towards the direction of the emergency signal and his eyes narrowed again.</p><br/><p>Could anything be more important than killing Ling Tian?! Everything was insignificant before the possibility of killing Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>If Yu ManLou knew what was happening in the distance, even if he felt that killing Ling Tian was of extreme importance, he would have probably sent some experts over as well. However, he was not a deity and he didn\u2019t know what had happened.</p><br/><p>After he realized what had happened, this decision of his made him regret for a very long time!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t manage to pick up a watermelon and ended up losing the seeds! Furthermore, it was a huge seed!</p><br/><p>This emergency signal was the signal sent by a Yu Family agent because he had discovered Shui QianHuan\u2019s hiding spot! Shui QianHuan finally managed to make use of Ling Tian. While the both of them were unaware of this matter, Shui QianHuan was undoubtedly only able to escape because of Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>The sky suddenly turned dark and the stars in the night sky seemed to have been covered at this moment!</p><br/><p>The moment which Ling Tian had been bitterly waiting for, the darkest moment before daybreak, was finally here!</p><br/><p>The time was right!</p><br/><p>This sudden moment of darkness caused Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes which were already accustomed to the darkness to feel slight discomfort. He couldn\u2019t help but blink his eyes and was completely lost about what was going on.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, something happened!</p><br/><p>A dark figure sprinted towards the wall like a gust of wind and speed of lightning!</p><br/><p>Before everyone could even react, the figure had already pounced up the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d The Pavilion Head of the River Mountain Pavilion who was the nearest pounced forward and with the momentum of his pouncing action, he circulated his inner qi and sent out a powerful palm strike!</p><br/><p>This palm strike of his had the slight intention of perishing together with his enemy! After witnessing his partner of decades pass away previously, the Pavilion Head of the River Mountain Pavilion wanted to take revenge for his partner at all costs!</p><br/><p>The moment he came into contact with the \u2018enemy\u2019, he realized that he was tricked! The only thing he struck was a soft piece of black robe! However, the Pavilion Head had already unleashed his full force palm strike and could no longer withdraw it. Thus, he had no choice but to tear apart the black robe and smash his palm strike onto the ground!</p><br/><p>The ground was already in complete chaos at this moment. As everyone\u2019s attention was focused on the flying black robes, Ling Tian\u2019s figure darted around like a demon and he sent out three palm strikes. Three black-robed Yu Family experts were then sent flying into the sky! Before they could even let out a shriek, they were shot dead like a porcupine by the archers on standby!</p><br/><p>When Ling Tian had just made his move, Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes shone with a violent glow and with a single leap, he appeared behind Ling Tian and smashed his palms down! Ling Tian turned his body around nimbly and the exquisite movement technique of his avoided Yu ManLou\u2019s attack at the final moment. At the same time, he sent all the black-robed experts in front of him up to the skies.</p><br/><p>In the sky, one black-robed figure after another had become a human porcupine and landed down on the ground like dead pigs. In the surroundings, the archers\u2019 faces were cold as they mechanically nocked a new arrow and continued firing downwards to take the lives of their brothers!</p><br/><p>They would rather kill a thousand wrongly then let their enemy off! Regardless of whether it was their enemy or ally!</p><br/><p>Another few figures swiftly appeared in front of Ling Tian. They had long noticed Yu ManLou chasing after Ling Tian but the swift movement techniques of the two individuals rendered them incapable of spotting the Yu ManLou and Ling Tian\u2019s exact location.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then let out a chuckle and said, \u201cIt has been a tough night guys!\u201d He then waved his sleeves and spun around oddly on the spot. Following which, the sounds of metal slicing through the air could be heard and thousands of silver lights shot out from Ling Tian\u2019s body. All of the hidden weapons that Ling Tian had accumulated on his body was sent out together! From afar, Ling Tian\u2019s figure was like a bright sun which flashed for an instant!</p><br/><p>This time, this flash was fatal!</p><br/><p>Everyone was immediately startled as they brandished their weapons in an attempt to protect themselves.</p><br/><p>A wave of mournful wails could be heard all over the place! How could Ling Tian\u2019s trump card be so easily blocked? After all, they were not Justice! How could there be a second Justice in the world?</p><br/><p>\u201cHong!\u201d Ling Tian turned around and with something in his palm, he suddenly matched a palm strike with Yu ManLou! With a loud bang, a black mist spread out the surroundings with an odd smell.</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable!\u201d Yu ManLou cursed. Afraid that there may be poison in the mist, he quickly held his breath and retreated back. Through that single palm strike, he could feel his body actually shaking slightly from the powerful inner qi of his opponent! To think that his opponent actually had such profound cultivation! Even if his opponent was slightly weaker than him, it wasn\u2019t by too much!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian also retreated two steps and after sending out a couple of palm strikes, balls of mist could be seen spreading from all directions. The next moment, the whole courtyard was filled with a thick mist, rendering them incapable of seeing beyond 30 centimeters!</p><br/><p>\u201cHold your breath! There may be poison in the mist!\u201d The Head Deacon hurriedly shouted.</p><br/><p>With a few pounding sounds, a few miserable groans could be heard from the wall and the sound of a few heavy objects landing on the ground could be heard. With a loud roar, Ling Tian immediately escaped.</p><br/><p>The cool morning breeze blew away the mist, and the sky was bright!</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other with complete disbelief! Who would have imagined that despite the dense encirclement of countless experts, their enemy was still able to escape and played them all for a fool! Just a moment ago, all of them were still full of confidence and felt that no one apart from Justice would be able to escape this encirclement of theirs! However, the cruel reality had destroyed all of their confidence as this person was obviously not Justice!</p><br/><p>Seeing the many corpses like porcupines on the ground, everyone couldn\u2019t help but feel bitterness in their heart! Their enemy\u2019s martial arts, composure, resilience, and perfect planning were at a mystical level! To think that there would be someone like this in the world apart from Justice!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is the Family Head?\u201d Yu ChaoRan calmed himself down and asked after looking around.</p><br/><p>With his reminder, everyone realized that the Family Head and his two guards had actually disappeared.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

During this time Justice had thoroughly enjoyed himself. He treated people however he wanted to, practiced whichever medical skill he deemed fit, and his words were akin to law. Ling Feng and Ling Yun had long recovered from their wounds. Before this, they had only respected Ling Jian, but now his position was gone, replaced by Justice! Other than helping the group to treat their injuries, Justice had taken the opportunity to develop them further on the pretext of healing. Not just the duo, but also the other group of soldiers that were previously injured had to suffer through Justice\u2019s \u2018treatment\u2019. While they screamed in misery, their overall capabilities seemed to have undergone an improvement.</p><br/><p>However, in the minds of all those in the Ling Family Courtyard, the word Justice was now synonymous with unreasonable. What did they mean? Simply put, Justice was an abuser. Whatever grudges he had against Ling Tian were immediately vented out on these people, and who exactly would be able to handle the rage of the top expert in the world?</p><br/><p>As such, for a long period of time afterward, every time the name Justice was mentioned a certain group of people would have expressions as though they had seen a ghost\u2026</p><br/><p>On a particular day, following a high-pitched squealing, the door of the secret chamber of the Ling Family Courtyard finally yawned open. Ling Tian finally revealed his head, and it was to naturally understand the situation around the area for the past few days. However, the moment he heard the reports, he nearly lost his head and ran off to find Justice!</p><br/><p>In one of the empty courtyards, Justice was currently \u2018checking on\u2019 Ling Feng and Ling Yun\u2019s physique!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian strode over, and the moment the duo saw Ling Tian, they replied with aggrieved voices as though they were kids that had seen their parents, \u201cYoung Noble!!\u201d These two words were filled with a lot of grief, and it made one wonder just how much torture they had been through!</p><br/><p>When Ling Tian focused, he stared in shock. It had only been a few days, but Ling Feng and Ling Yun\u2019s martial skills seemed to have had risen in strength! Furthermore, this increase seemed to have been natural. While it was a cause for happiness, by looking at their aggrieved faces Ling Tian immediately understood that it was because Justice could not find him and used them in his place to vent his frustrations, leading to this situation.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Tian\u2019s flustered and discomfited look, Justice laughed to himself, \u201cKid, how dare you take this old man as your worker? I\u2019ll definitely show you the repercussions, and this is just the beginning!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice suddenly stepped forward to hold onto the lapels of Ling Tian\u2019s shirt, before speaking in an exaggerated manner, \u201cLing Tian! You bastard! What do you take this man as?! Are your buttocks feeling itchy once more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I take you as? What, what did you say you did?\u201d Ling Tian was completely dumbfounded by Justice, not knowing what was going on.</p><br/><p>Justice huffed and panted in anger, \u201cI did your mom! You merely dusted off your butt before running into the secret chamber, while this man was left out here to work to the bone for you! I had to practice medicine, save people, and even help you to train them. This is the first time I\u2019ve taken such a great loss since I came onto the martial scene! Ling Tian, you better give this man an answer. If I\u2019m not satisfied, then this man will take care of you! And this time, it won\u2019t be as simple as slapping you on the buttocks twice!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Ling Feng and Ling Yun were stunned silly. \u201cAh?! This old man had even dared to \u2018train\u2019 the young noble? Then we have no need to feel aggrieved!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could feel a headache coming on, and he scratched his head fiercely, before his expression turned fierce as well, \u201cBoss, I only invited you to help heal those injured and dying! Do you have to be so emotional? You\u2019ve depleted close to a decade\u2019s worth of my accumulation of herbs, who am I supposed to go to for recompense?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBullsh*t, this daddy is damn good to help you help your subordinates. Isn\u2019t it just using a few herbs?\u201d Justice angrily stared at him. \u201cThis daddy here did not even stop working once during these past two weeks!\u201d In his \u2018anger\u2019, Justice even changed his self reference from \u2018this man\u2019 to \u2018daddy\u2019.</p><br/><p>However, during the last two weeks Justice really had not stopped working once. Not just the original injured were treated, as with Meng LiGe\u2019s \u2018assistance\u2019, he had gathered every mother, father, and child of the Ling Family Courtyard. They were then passed to Justice with only a respectful sentence of, \u201cMy young noble mentioned that since Martial Owner plans to use his magical hands to bring these injured and dying back to life, that he should take the chance and help to treat all these people as well. My house\u2019s young noble will forever remember your kindness, and will not allow Martial Owner to walk alone in the front any longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>To tell the truth, Meng LiGe was sweating profusely when he spoke this sentence. He knew just how frightening his Martial Order Medallion owner could be, and in addition, Ling Tian\u2019s words were just too outrageous, especially the last sentence. What did he even mean?! However, Ling Tian had insisted before entering seclusion that he had to repeat word after word of whatever he said to Justice\u2026</p><br/><p>This sentence made Justice not know whether to laugh or cry, and he was extremely depressed in his heart. He originally intended to just treat the wounds of Ling Feng and Ling Yun, but now that Meng LiGe had lumped all the injured together, be it one or all, he would still have to make a move, thus he might as well do it. Besides, he had been pretty bored recently\u2026</p><br/><p>As such\u2026</p><br/><p>With only five days of work, under Justice\u2019s miraculous hands and the use of expensive herbs, everyone could have said to have recovered fully from their wounds. As for Ling Feng and Ling Yun, the seriously injured few under the relentless care of Justice, they were more than halfway recovered. This was truly a heaven-defying skill of treatment. The famed physician of the Ling Family who had rushed over could only sigh ceaselessly in praise, lamenting about how he had lived his life in vain, only being able to see the true essence of a fine doctor just now!</p><br/><p>Of course, while Justice\u2019s skill in medicine could be said to be peerless among those of his generation, the result could also be attributed to the great stock of herbs present in the warehouse of the Ling Family Courtyard! It was to the point that even a peerless medical saint such as Justice felt as though he had walked into a treasure trove! In the past, in order to refine the Great Cyclic Pellet, Ling Tian had literally activated all of his forces to search for all kinds of precious medicines. This was especially so for the bandits, who had robbed and pillaged on more than one occasion, sending cart after cart into the Ling Family Courtyard. After a long period of accumulation, this resulted in the beautiful scenario inside the warehouse of the Ling Family Courtyard. If one were to use Ling Tian\u2019s words, it would be: Any random kick in there would be able to unearth a ginseng or lingzhi\u2026</p><br/><p>With his second identity as a medical practitioner, Justice was of course thrilled to discover such a medicinal warehouse. This was also the root cause as to why Justice had worked so tirelessly. The end result was obvious. More than half of the stock inside the medicinal warehouse was depleted, with the rare and precious herbs totally wiped clean. This was also the reason why Ling Tian wanted to cry yet had no tears coming out\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing how Justice, in order to take revenge, had willfully plundered and used all the precious herbs of heaven and earth and yet was still acting so haughty, to say that Ling Tian did not feel some heartache would be a lie. However, this very person was the one who had saved his family and his relatives, and he couldn\u2019t bring himself to say anything. Furthermore, the reason why he gathered so many herbs was also to save his own brothers, was it not? Ling Tian\u2019s eyes rolled as he suddenly changed his tone, \u201cAiya, we\u2019re all good friends, so why are we even harping on such trivialities? I\u2019ll remember this favor from you! Besides, I seem to see something different about you now, have you broken through recently? It seems like I really need to find some more people for you to practice on, and everyone can take this chance to discuss and debate further. This should be enough, right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence perfectly scratched Justice\u2019s itch. His eyes immediately lit up as the anger in his heart faded. He had already had a pleasant surprise when he entered the Ling Family Courtyard this time around. First was this lady Ling Chen who actually could rely on her own strength to resist Lei ZhenTian. This already earned praise from him. Then Ling Jian\u2019s penetrating Sword and Body as One which was akin to severing the heavens and earth caused his eyes to light up even more. In addition, the unrestrained manner and ice-cold killing intent that Li Xue exuded when she performed her Sword and Body as One skill already caused him to exclaim endlessly. Finally, it was the fact that Ling Tian actually forcefully broke through under the heavy pressure exerted by the Unlimited Will of Heaven\u2026</p><br/><p>Right now, inside the Ling Family Courtyard, those people that could catch his eyes were only these four! Add in the still-developing Ling Chi, as well as Ling Feng and Ling Yun whom he was personally training now, and Justice could imagine that if he continued to spar with these people it would be a great help to his own cultivation!</p><br/><p>Within this group, Justice was most interested in Ling Jian and Ling Tian! The killing intent exuded by these two was no less than his own, and Ling Jian\u2019s killing intent was actually sharper than him!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just that Ling Jian and Ah\u2019Xue still have to recuperate for a few more days to heal their wounds. If we act now, I\u2019m afraid it would cause irreparable damage to their bodies. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware that if your killing intent polluted their spiritual consciousness, it will not be something that can be removed in a short period of time\u2026\u201d Ling Tian put out an embarrassed look.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s alright!\u201d Justice heartily agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s no big deal to wait a few more days. Let them heal to the best of their abilities! Oh right, this is for you.\u201d As he spoke, he tossed a jade bottle over to Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d Ling Tian asked as he opened the stopper. In an instant, a wondrous medicinal fragrance assailed his senses!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026. this should be the Heaven Reversing Restoration Pill?\u201d Ling Tian sniffed a little, before suddenly opening his eyes wide and becoming speechless. If this was truly that pill, then his debt would really be too heavy. This was the ultimate panacea for healing and was said to even be able to save a man on his last breath, as well as regrow flesh on bare bones. Consuming this pill would aid a person in attaining 10 years worth of cultivation time, and this was a divine pill that could not be sought or found just because one wanted to!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Noble, you recognize this pill? What is this Heaven Reversing Restoration Pill? Both Ah\u2019Yun and I have eaten one already!\u201d By the side, Ling Feng interjected.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed the Heaven Reversing Restoration Pill. Otherwise, how do you think that these two kids would recover from their wounds so quickly? With their injuries, it probably had already reached deep into their bones and tendons. Other than using the Heaven Reversing Restoration Pill, how else would I be able to restore their bodies without their cultivations decreasing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian suddenly executed a deep bow, almost touching the floor as he exclaimed, \u201cI\u2019ll thank Senior on behalf of those two kids!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice stared in shock. He naturally did not expect Ling Tian to be so touched just by helping him. What was this about?</p><br/><p>But Justice was not aware that Ling Tian had always treated these kids like his own brothers. While Justice had saved the entire Ling Family Courtyard, it was not necessarily the issue that weighed on Ling Tian\u2019s heart. Instead, by saving Ling Chen, Ling Feng, Ling Yun and the rest, it was enough to earn the eternal gratitude of Ling Tian instead!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pull this stunt with me. Suddenly being so polite to this old man here, I\u2019m really not used to it. Okay, take the Heaven Reversing Restoration Pill and give it to the two brats as well as the lass!\u201d Justice replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, now that there\u2019s this miraculous panacea, this is the best time to use it. They\u2019ll definitely recover quicker than expected.\u201d Ling Tian breathed in deeply. Once their injuries have fully healed, I\u2019ll make the arrangements, be it one on one or as a group, and we\u2019ll have a good battle. Say, older brother, do you still have any more Heaven Reversing Restoration Pills? It would be good if I could get a few more\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think these are candy?! Get lost!\u201d Justice\u2019s blood was actually boiling when he heard that there would be a group battle, but after hearing Ling Tian\u2019s avaricious request, his expression immediately soured.</p></div>\n</div>"}

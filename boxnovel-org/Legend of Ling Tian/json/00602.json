The immense pain caused Ling Tian\u2019s body to contort for a moment before it subsided. After that, a sharp pain could also be felt from his left leg. It turned out that his left leg was also injured. Ling Tian\u2019s attention was then diverted to his left leg and as he took a look at the injuries of his left leg, the pain on his left shoulder seemed to have decreased\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was stunned for a moment before quickly coming to a realization. Because his attention was focused on his left leg, he naturally ignored his left shoulder. It did not mean that the pain in his left shoulder was no longer there but because his attention was diverted the pain felt less.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt as though he had received sudden enlightenment. Because I placed all of my attention on Lei ZhenTian, I was pressured by the sudden explosion of his aura. As long as I shift my attention away from him, I won\u2019t be feeling that miserable. However, how should I avoid his attacks after shifting my attention away? It is already difficult for me to avoid his attacks while being fully focused on him, how would I be able to do so if I shifted my focus? Wouldn\u2019t I be opening myself up to all his attacks?</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian looked at Ling Tian with a malevolent grin and mocked, \u201cLing Tian, what are you thinking about? Are you thinking about which layer of hell you will be in after your death? Hahaha\u2026\u201d Under the lock of his aura, Lei ZhenTian could clearly feel every movement of Ling Tian\u2019s muscles. Under such circumstances, Lei ZhenTian was extremely certain that he would be able to kill Ling Tian. He even felt that Justice wouldn\u2019t be a match for him.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a figure flew past his eyes and a loud laugh could be heard. Ling Tian who was in front of him had escaped from the lock of his aura! Furthermore, Lei ZhenTian\u2019s aura did not follow Ling Tian\u2019s trace!</p><br/><p>However, his eyes told him that Ling Tian was obviously thirty feet away from him! Just what was going on?</p><br/><p>Just when Lei ZhenTian mentioned the word \u2018hell\u2019, inspiration was born in Ling Tian\u2019s mind. When a human\u2019s soul entered hell, it would be reduced to primal chaos before being restructured into a new soul for reincarnation.</p><br/><p>Primal chaos was a method to meld his body into the surroundings. What was primal chaos? Being one with the world? Or perhaps\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt a knot untie in his heart and was immediately enlightened. He then let out a hearty laugh before easily escaping from the lock of Lei ZhenTian\u2019s aura. His figure was extremely carefree and unrestrained! Since Ling Tian had already been enlightened, while Lei ZhenTian\u2019s aura would still be a huge threat to him, it wouldn\u2019t be enough to kill him.</p><br/><p>Justice who was watching secretly from the side also laughed with satisfaction. Based on his judgment, he was certain that Ling Tian would definitely be able to survive Lei ZhenTian\u2019s \u2018Unlimited Will of Heaven\u2019 with the agility of his movement techniques, ever-changing Divine Shocking Dragon Formula, and his body full of hidden weapons. While Ling Tian would be severely wounded after that, he definitely wouldn\u2019t die. At the same time, it would also be a positive form of pressure for Ling Tian to consider how to break out of such a situation. If Justice took action to kill Lei ZhenTian, Ling Tian would never be able to walk out of the shadow of this incident! Instead, Ling Tian had actually unexpectedly experienced a breakthrough at this moment!</p><br/><p>Every technique definitely had a way of being broken. While Lei ZhenTian\u2019s inner qi increased five times after using his Unlimited Will of Heaven technique, his realm had not changed the slightest. If Justice was the one fighting Lei ZhenTian, he would still be able to easily take care of Lei ZhenTian. This was a difference between one\u2019s realm. While Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts were indeed above Lei ZhenTian, both of their martial arts realm were of similar levels. Thus, Ling Tian could be trapped in such a sticky situation!</p><br/><p>There was a huge difference between experiencing a breakthrough after a long accumulation of experience and suddenly experiencing enlightenment during battle. Even Justice who was the number one expert in the world had never seen or even heard of such an event. Justice could even feel that Ling Tian had already reached his realm when he was chasing after Ling Tian back then. What a good brat who truly knew how to give him surprises.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s body seemed to have turned into a formless green smoke, weaving around Lei ZhenTian at an extremely high speed. With Lei ZhenTian\u2019s eyesight, he was actually unable to lock on to Ling Tian\u2019s exact location!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian was also crying out bitterly in his heart. While he had just experienced a breakthrough in his martial arts realm and would not exhaust much inner qi when displaying his movement techniques, he did not dare to go too far from Lei ZhenTian. The might of Lei ZhenTian\u2019s Unlimited Will of Heaven technique was truly terrifying and he may be caught by Lei ZhenTian at any time. Regardless of where Ling Tian tried to hide, the place would definitely be destroyed. Under such circumstances, Lei ZhenTian was like an atomic missile and Ling Tian was like the trigger.</p><br/><p>If the atomic missile must be ignited no matter what, Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t want any of his subordinates to be harmed. However, he who was the trigger would definitely have to pay a price because he was just too near.</p><br/><p>As compared to Ling Tian, Lei ZhenTian was even more anxious. He had already unleashed all of his inner qi and the surging inner qi had already accumulated in his body to the point it was about to explode. If he didn\u2019t unleash it in soon, he would probably end up exploding on the spot. But at this moment, Ling Tian had suddenly escaped from the lock of his aura. Under Ling Tian\u2019s swift and agile movement techniques, Lei ZhenTian\u2019s eyes were filled with countless figures of Ling Tian. He just did not know which direction to attack in.</p><br/><p>However, he did not dare to launch a probing strike. The accumulation of his inner qi had been complete and his lifetime\u2019s worth of inner qi was already on the verge of explosion. As soon as he made a move, his whole body would definitely explode! There wasn\u2019t a chance for him to launch a probing strike at all.</p><br/><p>If he unleashed his Unlimited Will of Heaven recklessly, with Ling Tian\u2019s movement techniques, Ling Tian would only be severely injured but not killed. Lei ZhenTian\u2019s eyes were completely red from anger but he was completely helpless.</p><br/><p>With one of them rapidly sprinting around while the other staying still, their battle fell into a stalemate.</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian seemed to have gained an upper hand by leaving behind thousands of after images to surround Lei ZhenTian, it would be impossible for him to keep this up for long periods of time. As soon as Ling Tian couldn\u2019t keep up his speed and Lei ZhenTian managed to find Ling Tian\u2019s true body, Lei ZhenTian had complete confidence in killing Ling Tian with a single blow.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Lei ZhenTian had recklessly unleashed his Unlimited Will of Heaven technique and his inner qi was already on the verge of explosion. If Ling Tian wasn\u2019t able to keep up his agile movement techniques, he would be the first to enter the afterlife. But if Lei ZhenTian couldn\u2019t control his raging inner qi, Ling Tian would be the one to emerge victorious!</p><br/><p>While it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for Ling Tian to escape from Lei ZhenTian with his current realm and movement techniques, Lei ZhenTian would definitely vent his frustrations on the members of the Ling Family if Ling Tian were to escape at this moment. If Ling Chen, Yu BingYan or anyone else were to perish because of this, Ling Tian would definitely regret it for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that not many people on the battlefield could tell that while Ling Tian seemed to have the upper hand, he actually had his hands tied.</p><br/><p>Of course, there were still some who had keen eyesight such as Li Xue and Ling Jian. Seeing Ling Tian\u2019s difficult situation, they immediately took action!</p><br/><p>The only one who could truly identify the crucial point of victory was Justice! Apart from him, there wasn\u2019t anyone else who understood that Ling Tian didn\u2019t want anybody to interfere in the battle!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian first let out a loud roar before making a somersault in mid-air. A brilliant sword ray then appeared in mid-air and formed a ball of light that shone even brighter than the sun! As Ling Jian sword let out a loud shrill, he suddenly shot down towards Lei ZhenTian in a beautiful arc like a flaming arrow! It was as though a dragon had descended from the sky!</p><br/><p>Justice who was still treating the casualties had witnessed this scene. Looking at the splendor in the sky, a look of praise could be seen in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Good moves!</p><br/><p>What a good \u2018man and sword as one\u2019!</p><br/><p>Feeling the danger that Ling Tian was in, Ling Jian circulated all of his inner qi to unleash the most perfect \u2018man and sword as one\u2019 technique that he could muster! The strength of this strike had even shocked the number one expert, Justice!</p><br/><p>From this moment on, the number one assassin in the world, Ling Jian, had also entered the sights of Justice!</p><br/><p>At the same time\u2026</p><br/><p>Li Xue also let out a battle cry and her sword was brandished with a bloody light. Amid the spraying blood, more than ten Lei Family warriors collapsed onto the ground with their innards flying in all directions. Li Xue then charged up to the sky riding on her sword ray and shot down towards Lei ZhenTian like a comet. When she was halfway towards Lei ZhenTian, her whole body had already turned into a creamy white sword light!</p><br/><p>She had also unleashed the same \u2018man and sword as one\u2019 technique but she was obviously superior to Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>Justice looked at Li Xue with a trace of surprise in his face before shaking his head with regret. While her martial arts were superb, it was a pity that she as a lady. Justice was filled with regret in his heart as he shook his head.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of this expert, a lady was a lady. Even if her comprehension and talent were top-notch, she was destined to go through childbearing and raise her children. Justice was a male chauvinist and had a deeply rooted prejudice towards ladies. He had never taken a lady to be an opponent. While Li Xue\u2019s martial arts were above Ling Jian and enough to draw his interest, he still disdained to fight her.</p><br/><p>If only she was a man, Justice grumbled in his heart.</p><br/><p>At the same time\u2026</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian saw that both Ling Jian and Li Xue wanted to save him, he became extremely anxious. Their timing truly couldn\u2019t be worse. He had just made a breakthrough and was at his aura was at its peak. While he was currently in a precarious situation, Ling Tian had the confidence of turning the tide around. If Lei ZhenTian were to unleash the Unlimited Will of Heaven technique at any one of them right now, the person would be dead for sure!</p><br/><p>They wanted to attack Lei ZhenTian so that they could exchange their life for Ling Tian\u2019s survival! However, they did not know that this would disturb Ling Tian\u2019s mental state. The moment Ling Tian\u2019s mental state was disturbed, the one who would die would definitely be Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>After all, Ling Tian was Lei ZhenTian\u2019s true target!</p></div>\n</div>"}

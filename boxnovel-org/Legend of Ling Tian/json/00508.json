What Martial Order Medallion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was speechless.</p><br/><p>Justice laughed even harder, \u201cLing Tian, even without the Martial Order Medallion, I will find you for a fight when I feel like it.\u201d He then suddenly glared at Ling Tian fiercely. \u201cIf you are unable to accompany me up the tortoise\u2019s back five years from now, I will really kill you! Someone who is unable to walk by my side isn\u2019t worthy to be alive!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian rolled his eyes and grumbled, \u201cSo it turns out that the death penalty still exists but has only been delayed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell Ye QingChen that I will have nothing to do with Beyond Heavens from today onward! Tell them to also disperse themselves, there isn\u2019t a meaning for their existence!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice then shot into the air with a bright laugh and disappeared from the tent. Only the violent flapping of the tent\u2019s flaps could be seen, and Ling Tian completely could not tell how Justice disappeared. Justice\u2019s voice then sounded from afar, \u201cI am going to find the tortoise and it is best that you climb faster\u2026 I will be at ease if the Heaven Splitter is by your side\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be at ease if the Heaven Splitter is by your side.\u201d Ling Tian repeated under his breath and tried to understand what was the meaning behind those words. He then suddenly burst out laughing, \u201cGaining the world by gaining the Heaven Splitter?\u201d Ling Tian snorted, \u201cI wonder how these pig-headed people are thinking! Even if it is extremely sharp and can slice through a thousand armies with a single wave, so what about that? It is still a sword! If anyone were to believe that rumor and raise the banners of war because of this sword, he would definitely be ripped into shreds in less than ten minutes! What a big joke!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue could then be seen peeking into the tent again with doubt, \u201cWhy is he finding a tortoise? Why do you have to climb faster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at her for a moment before complaining while burying his head into the blanket. \u201cThat fellow actually left a seriously wounded patient in the depths of the forest\u2026 how heartless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue could not help but be tickled, \u201cIt is already a miracle that he didn\u2019t kill you. Did you expect him to become your bodyguard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cAs long as he stays by my side for a few days, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for me to dupe him into becoming my bodyguard. What a pity, what a pity!\u201d He then suddenly let out an \u2018eh\u2019 before saying, \u201cHow fragrant. What\u2019s this smell?\u201d Ling Tian then took in a deep breath with the blanket near his nose and had a face full of intoxication.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue\u2019s face turned red and was completely embarrassed. She had been using the blanket for the past few days, and the smell was naturally the fragrance of a young maiden. Looking at Ling Tian\u2019s look of enjoyment, she could not help but roll her eyes and growl, \u201cIdiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed out loud and winked his eyes in a sneaky manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue covered her mouth and giggled beautifully. With Justice gone, the death looming over Ling Tian\u2019s head had also disappeared, and Xiao YanXue could finally be at ease. She suddenly felt as though the scenery around her was extremely enchanting and her mood was incomparably good.</p><br/><p>A day later, Ling Tian, whose injuries were largely recovered, leaned against a rock by the stream and carefully studied the jade pendant in his hand.</p><br/><p>His jet-black hair was loose, and it was actually tied up in a fancy style which was naturally the doing of Miss Xiao YanXue. When Miss Xiao was washing Ling Tian\u2019s hair, she realized that Ling Tian\u2019s hair was actually black, thin and extremely supple. She thus could not control herself from dolling him up.</p><br/><p>After Xiao YanXue tied up Ling Tian\u2019s hair, she was blown away by her own work and praised that if Ling Tian put on a dress, he would definitely be able to capture the attention of the birds and beasts, have a beauty exceeding that of the natural world and capable of making anyone who saw him want to dote on him with pity. This exaggerated remark made Ling Tian not know whether to laugh or cry. While Ling Tian was a martial arts expert, the recovering him could not even beat a small, little child. He naturally fell into the hands of Miss Xiao and was subjected to her torture and enjoyment.</p><br/><p>When \u2018capture the attention of the birds and beasts\u2019 and \u2018have a beauty exceeding that of the natural world\u2019 is used to describe a lady, it would naturally make one\u2019s imagination roam. But if it was used on a man\u2026 Ling Tian was certain that he would have to visit Korea for plastic surgery first before going to Thailand for another surgery\u2026</p><br/><p>The jade was still in its original form and apart from its original form, what kind of a form was it supposed to be in? Ling Tian studied it under the light for a good long while but was still unable to see anything odd about it. In truth, ever since Yu BingYan and Shui QianRou handed the pieces of jade to him, Ling Tian had always kept it in his embrace but never taken a good look at it before. After studying it carefully now, he realized that Yu BingYan\u2019s Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade was in the shape of half a leaf. Ling Tian could also remember that Shui QianRou\u2019s piece of jade was also in the same shape but forming the other half of the jade.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian casually picked up a rock and made a half-leaf shape based on his memory. After placing both the jade pendant and rock side by side, it was obvious that both of the jade pieces should form a whole and will also form a heart shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder it\u2019s called the Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade. It turns out that it really form the shape of a heart.\u201d Ling Tian mumbled before laughing, \u201cHowever, only half of this heart is left.\u201d Thinking about this, Ling Tian thought about the black dot that fell out from the jade pendant that Yu ManLou shattered. Upon reaching into his embrace to search for it, his expression could not help but change!</p><br/><p>That hexagonal shaped black dot had actually disappeared! Could it be that it went missing when his inner qi went berserk back then?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed out bitterly and thought to himself, Since it has already been shattered, what is the point of keeping it. Letting out a self-mocking chuckle, he could not help but be filled with a tinge of disappointment. He then continued to study the jade pendant in his hand further and after a while, a thought suddenly flashed past his head and he slapped his head bitterly.</p><br/><p>Since Shui QianRou\u2019s jade had a small black dot within it, Yu BingYan\u2019s jade pendant should also have one. However, after exposing the jade pendant to the sun for a whole day, the whole jade pendant turned dark and was obviously an extremely pure piece of jade. Not to mention a black dot, there wasn\u2019t a single flaw within it!</p><br/><p>Besides that, how was it possible for a black dot to exist in such a pendant? Furthermore, that black dot wasn\u2019t small at all and if it could be easily seen, wouldn\u2019t it tarnish the jade pendant?</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian was completely clueless about the origins of this jade pendant, he knew that a jade with impurity definitely couldn\u2019t be considered top quality. Could it be that the black dot was only present in Shui QianRou\u2019s jade but not Yu BingYan\u2019s?</p><br/><p>He then suddenly remembered what Justice had said before leaving: \u201cI have already tried to study it with my inner qi but could not get a reaction. Your inner qi is probably the only thing capable of forming a connection with it.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, Ling Tian felt that the words Justice had said were extremely strange. How could the inner qi that he had painstakingly cultivated ever form a connection with a jade pendant? At the same time, Ling Tian began to curse Justice for not being clear with his words before leaving.</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian had the intention to input his inner qi into the jade pendant to take a look, he just could not make up his mind. A top grade jade stone like this one usually has something special within it. If he were to input his inner qi into the jade pendant recklessly, it may be destroyed or even explode on the spot. In his previous life, he had read in the martial arts novels that experts enjoyed embedding their inner qi into jade swords to fight their opponents. Upon trying it himself, he found out that most jade stones would end up exploding if he wasn\u2019t careful.</p><br/><p>After trying it multiple times, Ling Tian was certain that it was no more than a writer\u2019s fantasy for inner qi being able to send out sword rays from a jade sword.</p><br/><p>However, Justice had clearly told him that his inner qi was able to form a connection with this jade pendant and this threw Ling Tian into a dilemma. Shui QianRou\u2019s jade pendant was something that he got by being a scoundrel and it wouldn\u2019t matter if it was destroyed. However, Yu BingYan\u2019s jade pendant was their official token of love. If it was really destroyed, that depressed lass will probably end up overthinking.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a frustrated sigh and placed the jade pendant by the side. Currently, his inner qi was only half recovered, and while he was able to circulate his inner qi normally, he was still far from being able to control his inner qi as freely as he liked. It would be best for me to try it after my control over the inner qi has been fully regained. If something were to really go wrong, it would be bad if that lass ends up crying and wailing every day.</p><br/><p>The bulk of wounds on his body had already formed scabs, and Ling Tian could not help but admire Justice\u2019s treatment methods! His external wounds were recovering at a rapid rate but his internal injuries were healing slowly. The inner qi that Ling Tian had gathered over a day and night was slowly mending his meridians bit by bit. Only after his meridians were mended would his inner qi take a small step forward. Its speed was as slow as a snail, and even with Ling Tian\u2019s resolute willpower he could not help but grumble endlessly. But after each portion of his meridians were healed and Ling Tian used his inner vision to take a look at it, he would be filled with an immense sense of satisfaction! After Ling Tian had finally circulated his inner qi in a full cycle, Ling Tian was surprised to realize that the benefits he had gained this round were just as Justice had said and far exceeded his expectations!</p><br/><p>With a single thought and before Ling Tian\u2019s limbs could even react, his inner qi had already arrived at the designated point of attack and he could unleash it by just raising his hand. The speed at which his inner qi was gathered had rendered the already prepared Ling Tian dumbfounded!</p><br/><p>As his inner qi circulated throughout his meridians, a layer of black greasy and smelly substance also began oozing out from Ling Tian\u2019s skin. It was excreted from all parts of his body without a single inch of his skin being an exception. This made Xiao YanXue who was in charge of helping him clean up whine incessantly and she had repeatedly cursed him for being a pig head throughout the whole day.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian bore the hardship with equanimity and when Xiao YanXue came over to help him clean up, he would intentionally rub the greasy substance onto Xiao YanXue causing her to scream in both shock and anger. Following that, Xiao YanXue would then sneakily enter the mountain springs to take a bath after helping Ling Tian wash up. Mmm, at that time, the still immobile young noble Ling would then be as fit as a fiddle and would unleash his top-notch movement techniques to follow stealthily behind Xiao YanXue despite his pain. He would lay hidden nearby to admire the bathing beauty and become the legendary peeping tom. Err, in Xiao YanXue\u2019s eyes, young noble Ling was naturally seriously injured and still completely immobile\u2026</p><br/><p>Was he truly so despicable?!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian would return with drool flowing down the corner of his lips and be delighted with himself for a full half a day with a wretched look plastered all over his face. Xiao YanXue\u2019s figure was not just ordinarily good. Her supple chest, narrow waist and hourglass figure were just unforgettable. Especially her creamy white skin would make Ling Tian\u2019s saliva drip down subconsciously and he had the urge to turn into a wolf in the moonlight!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

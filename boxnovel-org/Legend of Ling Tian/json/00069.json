He could not help but receive a shock, inwardly scolding himself for dealing out such a heavy hand towards his son.</p><br/><p>Both Chu Ting\u2019er and Ling Ran had their eyes filled with unshed tears, and pounced forward at this time, cradling Ling Tian in their bosoms. This darling of theirs was screaming out, and seeing how Ling Tian\u2019s buttocks were intermingled with blood, both women could not help but start tearing. They simultaneously focused their glares at Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Ran did not even bother with manners, and immediately started berating, \u201cBrother, you are unreasonable! Tian\u2019er is just a little child, is there a need to hit him so hard? What can a child of his age know? The top beam is not straight, the lower beams will be crooked.[1] Even if he did anything wrong, why should you vent your frustrations on him?\u201d When she thought of how she finally got a chance to visit her parents, she hurriedly ran over to play with her long missed nephew. Who would have known that this would result in Ling Tian getting a severe beating!</p><br/><p>Hearing such words, Chu Ting\u2019er seemed to have turned red with embarrassment. She immediately carried her child and ran inside the room, ordering the servants to bring ointment as well as clean bandages over.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao turned around in embarrassment. Although his heart was full of regrets, he still did not wish to put himself down to admit his wrongdoings. Furthermore, what Ling Xiao was angry about in actuality was not about the fiasco created by Ling Tian. For such a small kid, even if he clowned around, what about it? What could actually happen? What really blew Ling Xiao\u2019s top was that with so many people seeing his son acting so wretchedly, it was impossible for him to hide it.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao could imagine that this matter would travel through the entire capital and provinces in the next few days, and he would most likely end up as a laughingstock in the entire imperial court. The Ling\u2019s Young Noble who was a silkpants was most assuredly going to resound throughout!</p><br/><p>Ling Kong and son, rejoicing in the misfortune, only offered a few conciliatory phrases to Ling Xiao before leaving in a joyful mood. Right now, it was no longer suitable for them to continue staying any longer.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao turned around, carrying a black face, and came face to face with a bunch of giggling Blood Iron Warriors. Because of frequently mixing around with them, they had Long become brothers in arms. Seeing their bedraggled looks, he could not help but lift up a brow and ask, \u201cWhat are you all doing? Why do you all look so worn out?\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd in question turned silent, no one had forgotten those steely words that Ling Tian had spoken that day: \u201cNo one should even think about revealing my matters to others!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Ling Xiao\u2019s face was growing all the more black, and his eyes looked akin to a storm brewing. \u201cTo think even his subordinates were not bothering to answer his question?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the situation was not going well, Feng Mo scratched his head and said: \u201cOoh\u2026 this\u2026 errr\u2026. this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao blew up once again. \u201cWhat this and what that! Quickly spit it out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Mo could only recite prayers in his heart as he spoke: \u201cThe Young Noble made us go running.\u201d Inside himself, he thought: \u201cThis should not be considered as revealing his secret, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRunning?\u201d Ling Xiao revealed some suspicion, \u201cRun for what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Feng Mo scratched his scalp in embarrassment. \u201c\u2026the Young Noble said that running was very fun\u2026\u201d After mulling about it for half a day, Feng Mo this sort of upright and honest man finally came out with his first lie, making him red with embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cFUN?!\u201d Ling Xiao jumped out of his skin once again, furiously hopping on his feet and snarling, \u201cThis daddy here worked so hard to train up the Blood Iron Warriors, to create warriors of the country that would win a hundred battles and more, to create heroes on the battlefield! This bastard actually dare to ask you go to run for fun??! What\u2026 what a d**che bag!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the group of Blood Iron Warriors, Ling Xiao spoke in shame, \u201cFellow brothers, I was the one who caused this to you. Because of me, you have to suffer the torture of this little bastard and his antics. Please rest assured, brothers, I will think of a method to return you guys back to the military!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd looked at each other in dismay, all wisely choosing to remain silent.</p><br/><p>While they were touched by Ling Xiao\u2019s sense of brotherhood, the crowd could not help but be worried \u2014 if Ling Xiao were to really get his way, they would all be recalled back to camp! In this half a month, the thirty six of them could clearly feel that be it in energy or physique, all of them were experiencing growth once again, and even to a point where it was unbelievable. This was just in half a month! The Young Noble even said, that this feeling was only the beginning, and was just a test. The real method to strength increase was far from this!</p><br/><p>With such a golden opportunity and good master in front of them, who would choose to return to that dark and hopeless future of an army camp? Unless, that person\u2019s head had been kicked by a mule! Immediately, everyone\u2019s heads turned towards Feng Mo; if his simple two sentences would make everyone else lose this chance, then they would definitely want to peel off his skin alive!</p><br/><p>Being the target of the piercing stares, Feng Mo\u2019s head started to sweat profusely and he forced a smile to say, \u201cGeneral does not need to worry, we little ones are also quite happy to stay here right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao let out a Long sigh, the rims of his eyes wet with tears. He patted Feng Mo\u2019s shoulder, lowly saying, \u201cBrothers, I know you all desire to keep me out of trouble. You all need not say more, all of you brothers can wait for my good news.\u201d As he finished, Ling Xiao turned and left, his expression solemn and his steps heavy.</p><br/><p>All those behind him were stunned silly! As they looked on the disappearing back of Ling Xiao, all of them walked towards Feng Mo with gritted teeth. Everyone started to clench their fists, the \u2018Kaka\u2019 sounds sounding unceasingly.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the situation had taken a turn for the worse, Feng Mo hurriedly retreated while drying laughing, \u201cBrothers, let\u2019s sit down and talk it out, hahaha, I was also forced to a corner\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeat him up!\u201d No one knew who first shouted, but immediately, a deluge of black clothed people covered Feng Mo in an instant. Feng Mo turned to run, but it was already too late. The sound of anguished wailing sounded, even worse than what Ling Tian had given out previously.</p><br/><p>Inside the room, Ling Tian who was regulating his inner Qi while listening to the conversation of the crowd, let out an expression of satisfaction. He now knew that this group of Blood Iron Warriors was really beginning to lean towards his side.</p><br/><p>A tiny shadow dashed out from Ling Tian\u2019s residence, this was precisely Ling Jian. The moment Ling Jian returned to the residence and heard that Ling Tian had gotten punished, he had panicked and rushed in without even cleaning his face.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Jian coming out, all of the Blood Iron Warriors gathered around him to listen to the latest news, leaving behind a Feng Mo on the brink of death\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey, Ling Jian ah, how is the Young Noble right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYa ya, Jianjian, what did the Young Noble say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYa ya, it has already been half a month, has the Young Noble said that we passed yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian looked towards all of them with a trace of pity in his eyes which was gone in a flash. He wore a strange look on his face, half laughing and crying. For a long while, he looked at them without talking which caused them to panic and have the sudden urge to rush forward to grab that slender neck to force every word out of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026 Cough\u2026\u201d Ling Jian cleared his throat as though he was about to talk. The audience suddenly held their breaths as they pricked up their ears.</p><br/><p>However, no one expected that after he finished coughing, he shook his shoulder and frowned, saying: \u201cMy shoulder is sore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey, is it sore? Let me massage it for you!\u201d A Blood Iron Warrior which seemed to have flames spitting out of his eyes rushed forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough\u2026 thigh hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll massage for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough cough\u2026 whole arm feels sore too, actually both arms feel sore.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll massage for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll massage for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, Ling Jian rolled his neck once in satisfaction before saying: \u201cThe Young Noble took the chance, while the Madam and the Consort Ling Ran was not around, to give me a few instructions for you guys!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of them tensed up, eyes focused without blinking onto Ling Jian\u2019s mouth, as though they were afraid to even miss one word.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian further coughed once, before saying: \u201cYoung Noble\u2019s original words were\u2026\u201d Then he smiled at them and actually stopped talking.</p><br/><p>The group\u2019s anger shot up towards the sky, all starting to rub their fists as if they wanted to teach him a lesson.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the situation was taking a turn for the worse, Ling Jian contracted his neck and mimicked Ling Tian\u2019s voice to say, \u201cMmm, actually you all should have passed. But seeing as how you guys watched this young noble get beaten up today, with none of you even attempting to intervene, and even gloating in my misfortune! Thus this young noble has decided that you are not yet ready to pass!\u201d Ling Jian winked and smiled.</p><br/><p>The group let out a long sigh, seeming as though they drained out all the air in them.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian suddenly continued: \u201cRelax, I\u2019ve not finished.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, everyone was on full alert once more.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I\u2019ve thought about it, and decided to give all of you one more chance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWahahaha\u2026. Long live the Young Noble!\u201d Came a series of joyous chorus.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian coldly eyed the group of idiots as he thought, \u201cDid you think that the Young Noble is so nice? How can you expect to reap any benefits without first suffering? That would be ridiculous!\u201d Then unhurriedly spoke, \u201cThus, for tomorrow\u2019s test, only those who passed may stay.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, tomorrow is the last test, easy, this is gonna be easy!\u201d The group was ecstatic.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian coldly announced, \u201cTomorrow\u2019s test consists of each person carrying an azurite stone, to walk two rounds from the entrance of the Ling mansion to the Ling Family Courtyard. The journey is around 160 miles and you have to finish the 2 rounds before lunch to pass!\u201d The azurite stones in this era weighed at least 10 catties each, and were thick and broad.</p><br/><p>\u201cAAHH?!\u201d A cry of despair sounded. At the same time, the thirty six of them seemed to have collapsed totally. The bitterness on their faces seemed as though it could be squeezed to form juice\u2026.</p><br/><p>One of them saw the look of smugness on Ling Jian\u2019s face, and could not help but counter him, saying: \u201cWe can\u2019t maintain this sort of thing, don\u2019t tell me you Little Jian can? Hehehe, hurry and go plead for leniency from our young noble!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone thought the same way, and started to clamor.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian however sniggered, saying: \u201cSorry to tell you but I\u2019ve already tried to plead leniency, and the Young Noble was kind enough to exempt me for tomorrow\u2019s exam! Hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The crowd felt like they had just suffered a crushing defeat!</p><br/><p>[1] If a leader sets a bad example, subordinates are likely to follow suit.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

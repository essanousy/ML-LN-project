Just a moment ago, it was as though he was on a battlefield and a moment later, it was as though he was basking in the gentle moonlight by the riverside. This drastic change in atmosphere caused even a steady person like Yu ManLou to fall into a daze.</p><br/><p>About forty to fifty feet in front of him, a young teen was standing under a tree and looking at him with an amiable smile. He had a graceful and steady disposition and every move of his seemed to carry with him an unrestrained and carefree aura. As the wind blew past, the leaves gradually floated down from the tree and looking from afar, this elegant young teen looked like a young noble who was out on vacation.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian didn\u2019t continue to escape but actually waited for Yu ManLou calmly! As Yu ManLou walked into the forest, Ling Tian greeted with a smile, \u201cYou have arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tone of Ling Tian\u2019s voice was as though he was greeting a friend who was joining him for tea. There was even a tinge of joy within it as though a martial arts expert who stood at the peak of the world finally found a peer to exchange pointers with him. This was the loneliness of standing at the peak of the continent and also the mutual appreciation between individuals who stood at the peak. This was also the greatest respect one had for a worthy opponent!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Ling Tian only had a single phrase in his heart. This phrase was not flattery or nonsense but Ling Tian\u2019s true feelings!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I were to search the whole world, the only heroes in the world would be you and I!\u201d Ling Tian finally understood CaoCao\u2019s loneliness when he had said these words . 1</p><br/><p>Just a moment ago, he was still chasing after Ling Tian and trying to exhaust all of his means to kill Ling Tian. But at this moment, Ling Tian\u2019s attitude had changed completely and this drastic change of attitude had shocked even the unshakable Yu ManLou.</p><br/><p>Just what was this young brat Ling Tian up to again? Could it be that he didn\u2019t know that facing the Family Head of the Yu Family up front in such a manner was an extremely dangerous move that could cost him his life in an instant?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s \u2018You have arrived\u2019 made Yu ManLou not know whether to laugh or cry and also made him feel that something was definitely wrong. Just what was Ling Tian relying on to treat him in such a manner? Furthermore, Yu ManLou was also very curious why Ling Tian was so certain that he wouldn\u2019t deal with him. After all, he was just chasing after Ling Tian in an attempt to take his life just a moment ago. Up until now, Yu ManLou couldn\u2019t even think of a reason why he shouldn\u2019t kill Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>With Yu ManLou\u2019s acute senses, he could naturally deduce Ling Tian\u2019s state of mind based on Ling Tian\u2019s words and expression. An odd feeling surfaced in Yu ManLou\u2019s heart and he revealed a smile. Following that, he swept off the dust on his robes as though he was a guest entering his host\u2019s residence. He then walked forward and said calmly, \u201cLing Tian, you are truly bold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian asked with his head slanted, \u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou replied with an amiable smile, \u201cFrom our previous exchange, even if you were at your peak, you would still be slightly weaker than me. Now that you have been hit by my special inner qi, you are definitely not a match for me right now. As long as I continue giving chase to you, you will not have the chance to treat your inner injuries and force out the poison. As time goes on, you will definitely die under my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s eyes gleamed and he replied with a warm smile, \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou placed his hands behind his back and looked at Ling Tian with an undisguised look of appreciation. \u201cCurrently, my subordinates should have already informed the surrounding Yu Family experts and regardless of which direction you escape towards, there will definitely be someone watching you. You will receive definitely suffer different levels of obstructions and while they wouldn\u2019t be able to block you, I would be following closely behind you. Thus, you are dead no matter what. After all, the surrounding thousand miles is the territory of my Yu Family! However, you actually chose to stop at this moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou smiled and said with a crisp tone, \u201cNot only did you stop, you even displayed such a casual attitude obviously with the intention to have a conversation with me. If I were to reject having a conversation with you right now, I would be lacking in demeanor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian broke out with a wide smile. \u201cYou are indeed the head of a family and a character with the hope of ruling the world. Those little thoughts of mine can\u2019t be hidden from you at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou shook his head as he laughed. \u201cDon\u2019t try and flatter me. Even though your words sound extremely nice, I know that you are an eloquent individual who can turn black into white and round into square. However, your eloquence is completely useless to me! Speak your true intentions! What do you want to say? What bargaining chips do you have up your sleeves?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRight, let me make something clear first. Regardless of what you say, you will never change my mind. You will definitely be killed by me today, and this is something that will never change.\u201d Yu ManLou let out a leisurely smile. \u201cYou are truly exceptional and I will never believe any of your promises. I will only be truly safe if an enemy like you dies. I believe that you also understand this point. In this world, there aren\u2019t many people capable of making me wary of and completely out of my control!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian replied with a smile, \u201cFamily Head Yu\u2019s words are true and I thank Family Head for your praise!\u201d</p><br/><p>A glimmer shone in Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes and he asked calmly, \u201cThen why did you stop? I don\u2019t believe that you would do something useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a smile and with a wave of his palms in a slicing motion horizontally. Two trees by the side were then sliced cleanly from three feet up without a single sound. With a single hand, Ling Tian controlled the body of the two trees using his inner qi and placed the two trees onto the ground lightly. He then dusted his hands and said with a carefree smile, \u201cAn esteemed guest has come from afar, please take a seat.\u201d He actually ignored Yu ManLou\u2019s question and raised his arm to welcome his guest.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou glared at Ling Tian for a long while with a sharp gaze before breaking out into a smile suddenly, \u201cInteresting, interesting indeed! To think that the bloodthirsty death god Ling Tian would be such an interesting person. It is a pity that there isn\u2019t any wine present at the moment or I would definitely offer a toast to you.\u201d He then walked forward slowly and sat down on the master\u2019s seat. Ling Tian was the host of this banquet with Yu ManLou being the guest. However, Yu ManLou had actually taken the master\u2019s seat obviously with the intention to overwhelm the host.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled and said, \u201cFamily Head Yu is being too impatient. The battle between us is no longer a matter of mere territorial borders but will affect the situation of the whole continent. Before the situation in the world is settled, the position of guest and host is of little importance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes flickered for a moment before saying, \u201cWe are in the territory of the Yu Family and I am the master here! Regardless of what happens in the future, that would be my status and this will be my seat! Over the many years, there have been many who wanted to take this seat of mine but they have all died without exception.\u201d Yu ManLou used his chin to point at Ling Tian, \u201cThere has been no exception, you will not be one and there wouldn\u2019t be any in the future as well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a silent chuckle and raised his head. \u201cFamily Head\u2019s words make sense. I am indeed a foreigner of this land, and I should be the guest instead.\u201d After that, he took a few steps back and sat down on the other tree stump.</p><br/><p>While they had not exchanged a single blow, the confrontation between them had already started. In this first round of confrontation, Yu ManLou had gained the upper hand, and Ling Tian who was seated in the guest\u2019s position was naturally on the losing end.</p><br/><p>The sound of the leaves rustling in the wind could be heard and two experts shot over at high speed.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at Yu ManLou with a calm smile and apart from a slight trace of ridicule and mockery, Yu ManLou couldn\u2019t read the deep thoughts in Ling Tian\u2019s eyes. Yu ManLou frowned and shouted, \u201cThe two of you are to wait outside. No one will be allowed to enter!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sprinting figures stopped outside the forest and a respectful voice sounded, \u201cYes!\u201d They then didn\u2019t enter.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian gave a calm smile and said with a trace of mockery and praise, \u201cWith a single command from Family Head, your subordinates don\u2019t dare to make a single move. You are indeed a wise ruler and this point alone is to be praised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou watched Ling Tian calmly with gentleness like a caring elder looking at his descendant. He then chuckled, \u201cI think I have an idea what you want to talk to me about already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian said, \u201cOh? Even with Family Head\u2019s brilliance, you may not be able to guess my thoughts right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou smiled, \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the two of them burst out into laughter together and there was no need for words.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou said with a bright laugh, \u201cThis atmosphere is indeed a mystical feeling. I think that there haven\u2019t been many people since the ancient times who would have the chance to face their enemy and have such a peaceful conversation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled and said, \u201cLing Tian does not feel that there is anything mystical about this. After all, I am still your in-law in name. While we may not have much time to converse as such in the future, we are relatives after all.\u201d After that, he looked at Yu ManLou with a profound smile, \u201cAs long as you are willing to go to Sky Bearing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s brows furrowed and sneered, \u201cIt is a pity that not a single father-in-law would be able to feel assured with such a son-in-law! Such a son-in-law like you will only swallow the bones of your father-in-law without even spitting out the bones or skin. This old man has no choice but to guard against you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed to the point he couldn\u2019t breathe before replying, \u201cFamily Head must be joking\u2026 ah ah\u2026 but is this really the case?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou remained motionless as though he didn\u2019t find what Ling Tian was laughing at funny, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unknowingly, the second confrontation ended and while it seemed to have ended in a tie, Ling Tian had the slight upper hand. However, he had to make use of Yu BingYan\u2019s name before gaining this slight upper hand.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

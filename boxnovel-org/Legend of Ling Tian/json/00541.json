On top of that, he even helped you to arrange everything appropriately.\u201d Li Xue looked at Ling Tian with widened eyes. \u201cThis is truly amazing. If I didn\u2019t know that you had just returned, I would have thought that the two of you were in contact before this. I really cannot understand that telepathy that you are talking about.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed bitterly. What he told Li Xue was indeed the truth. He and Ling Jian had been together since they were young and were extremely familiar with each other. Even biological brothers would probably be not as close as them.</p><br/><p>In fact, it wouldn\u2019t be an exaggeration to say that to Ling Jian, Ling Tian was a support that he could not do without and also a sense of security. As long as Ling Tian appeared near Ling Jian\u2019s area of senses, Ling Jian would be able to feel a sense of unknown security. This was an extremely mysterious phenomenon that even Ling Tian who had been through two lifetimes could not explain.</p><br/><p>Apart from Ling Jian, Ling Chen also had such a feeling. However, both of them were mutually in love with each other and had even joined as a single entity before. Thus, it wasn\u2019t surprising for such a phenomenon to occur. However, such a phenomenon happening with Ling Jian was truly odd.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys\u2026 can\u2019t possibly be homosexuals right? Didn\u2019t you already do that with younger sister Ling Chen? Could it be that he is pure but you will accept anything that comes your way?!\u201d Li Xue\u2019s mouth widened in shock as she looked at Ling Tian with the urge to puke.</p><br/><p>\u201cScram!\u201d Ling Tian mercilessly spanked her. \u201cYou are the one who will accept anything that comes your way! Don\u2019t forget that Ling Jian and I cultivate the same martial arts formula and have attained a certain level in it. Furthermore, we also grew up together! More importantly, Ling Jian has absolute loyalty and trust towards me! All of these are the factors that cause this mysterious phenomenon. That little brain of yours is always thinking the wrong way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue let out a shriek. Being caught off guard, she suddenly felt a burning pain on her behind and could not help but twitch her lips with dissatisfaction. \u201cI was only making a casual remark. Can\u2019t you even take a simple joke\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not allowed to even joke about it! You aren\u2019t even allowed to think about it!\u201d Ling Tian glared at her and bellowed, \u201cTo think that a lady like you would be able to think of something so disgusting\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the three of them had already come down out of the tree and were walking towards the carriage. Behind Ling Tian, Xiao YanXue used her hands to cover her mouth and nose. The bloody remains on the battlefield scared her to the point that her face turned pale and her body turned weak. After finally reaching the carriage, Xiao YanXue was the first to sprint up into it. Even if the bloody smell was still present, at least she couldn\u2019t see the bloody scene in front of her.</p><br/><p>From far off, a white shadow broke through the air and arrived carrying someone on her back at a lightning-fast pace. It was almost as though there was a puff of white smoke slicing across the sky and appearing in front of them. Ling Tian immediately stopped walking and a look of gentleness could be seen on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble\u2026\u201d Ling Chen said with a choking tone. She did not even bother putting down Shui QianRou who was on her back and dove into Ling Tian\u2019s embrace without any hesitation. Her face was filled with a surprised smile but tears had already begun flowing down her eyes. After looking at Ling Tian\u2019s face for short while, she suddenly buried her face into his embrace and her body began trembling as she started sobbing.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian knew how much this frail lady in front of him had given up for him. He patted her shoulders dotingly and allowed this beauty in front of him to vent all of her grievances, pain, and fatigue!</p><br/><p>By the side, Li Xue\u2019s eyes also became wet. There was joy, gratification, and a tinge of envy on her face but not a trace of jealousy could be seen. She knew just how much Ling Chen had given up for Ling Tian and knew the burden she had to endure over the past few months. Thus, she naturally wouldn\u2019t be jealous of this lady who was smitten with love. She walked forward quietly and took Shui QianRou off Ling Chen\u2019s back before entering the carriage and allowing these two lovebirds the space to have their reunion.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian hugged Ling Chen\u2019s soft body tightly as though he wanted to merge both of their bodies together. From the moment Ling Chen\u2019s beautiful face plunged into his embrace, Ling Tian felt his soul shaking and his body trembling. At the same time, a sense of warmth sprung forward from deep within his heart. This was his most beloved lady!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian raised Ling Chen\u2019s head up gently and looking at her moist eyes, his eyes burned with passion as he kissed the tears on Ling Chen\u2019s cheeks. Feeling Ling Chen\u2019s lips trembling, Ling Tian could no longer control himself and gave her a kiss on the lips. Ling Chen\u2019s body shook and she stretched out both her arms to lock around Ling Tian\u2019s neck. At the same time, she closed her eyes and enjoyed the love that she had not experienced for the last four months. At this instant, both of them felt as though their souls became light and were drifting among the clouds.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s tongue greedily roamed around and his tongue was curled up tightly with Ling Chen\u2019s as though he wanted to compensate her for the last few months of his absence. Ling Chen received all of Ling Tian\u2019s approaches and coiled her tongue back in response as though she wanted to present all of her body to her beloved man. After almost half a year of worry and longing, all of her emotions were released through this single kiss. A wave of ecstasy and happiness welled up within her chest.</p><br/><p>This kiss lasted for a long time until the skies turned dark and even the bloody smell dissipated. Ling Chen could no longer catch her breath but was still unwilling to separate from Ling Tian, allowing him to enjoy her as he pleased. Her eyes were intoxicated with joy and her face was flushed red like a beautiful rose.</p><br/><p>A long while later, the two of them finally separated from each other and Ling Chen leaned her head on Ling Tian\u2019s chest with her fingers playing around with Ling Tian\u2019s neck. Her body seemed to have lost all strength as she lay weakly in Ling Tian\u2019s embrace but her very being exuded with satisfaction and elation. At the same time, she had a languid demeanor which made her all the more alluring.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian used his cheek to gently sweep across Ling Chen\u2019s hair and the silkiness of her hair made him drunk in comfort to the point he almost let out a soft moan. He then asked her softly, \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Ling Chen nestled in Ling Tian\u2019s embrace and greedily took in her lover\u2019s scent. Without even thinking for a moment, she replied Ling Tian\u2019s question.</p><br/><p>\u201cSilly lass.\u201d Ling Tian stretched out his finger and tapped her lightly on the nose. He then hugged her tightly with his arms and lifted her off the ground. After spinning around on the spot, he said with heartache, \u201cYou\u2019ve become lighter. You have lost three catties in weight. Why have you become so skinny? Didn\u2019t you eat well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen raised her head up and looked at Ling Tian emotionally, \u201cAs long as young noble is able to return and still has Chen\u2019er in his heart, not to mention three catties, so what if it is thirty catties? Even if I lose more weight than that, Chen\u2019er will also be willing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was extremely moved in his heart and he rubbed Ling Chen\u2019s forehead with his own. With their eyes meeting, he reprimanded her gently, \u201cIt is your problem if you are willing but why don\u2019t you think about me as well?! Didn\u2019t I say before I left that no one in the world is capable of killing me? As long as you do not see my corpse, you should not believe that I am dead. Why do you have to torture yourself in such a manner? Don\u2019t you know how much heartache I would feel upon seeing you become skinny? Quickly go and eat your fill and regain all of your weight! Do you understand? Silly lass!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen smiled gently with an incomparably resolute gaze in her smile, \u201cChen\u2019er naturally knows that there isn\u2019t anyone capable of dealing with young noble in the world. Chen\u2019er was just worried and Chen\u2019er really missed you. I\u2026\u201d Before she could finish what she wanted to say, her mouth was covered by Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>A short while later, Ling Tian said softly, \u201cWe shall not separate from each other again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen nodded her heads gently and was filled with a satisfied smile. She leaned onto Ling Tian\u2019s chest and said with a dreamlike voice, \u201cYes, we shall not separate from each other again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them lay in each other\u2019s embrace silently as though no one else was round. In the middle of this bloody battlefield, all of the bloodiness seemed to have disappeared in the eyes of these two individuals leaving behind only silence and happiness\u2026</p><br/><p>In the carriage, Xiao YanXue and Li Xue were both waiting silently and did not say a thing. Occasionally, they would look at the two entwined figures with envy and longing in their gazes. Occasionally, the two of them would have suddenly thought about something and their faces would flush red\u2026</p><br/><p>A long while later, Ling Chen suddenly jumped up in shock, \u201cI\u2026 I forgot that younger sister Rou is still\u2026\u201d Upon reaching out to her back, her expression changed, \u201cEh? Where did she go?\u201d The moment Ling Chen saw Ling Tian, she ignored everything else. Despite her cultivation, Li Xue was actually able to take someone off her back without her feeling anything\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at her adorable appearance, Ling Tian could not help but pull her back into his embrace, \u201cSilly lass, your sister Li Xue had already taken her away. She helped us create a little world of our own but you\u2019re still in your dreams. You are truly a silly lass from head to toe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? Elder sister Li Xue was here\u2026\u201d She then suddenly realized that Li Xue would have witnessed everything that had just happened. She could not help but flush red with embarrassment as she snuck a look at the carriage not too far away. A small opening could be seen in the carriage and Li Xue revealed a mischievous smile, \u201cCough cough, I truly had a good feast for the eyes. How fiery and passionate\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen faced burned with embarrassment and she dove into Ling Tian\u2019s embrace while stomping her feet.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s skin was naturally incomparably thick and Li Xue\u2019s teasing could not affect him in the slightest. He hugged Ling Chen up the carriage and the carriage was thankfully big enough to hold all five of them. After they all got on the carriage, they suddenly realized that there wasn\u2019t a coachman\u2026</p><br/><p>( )</p><br/><p>Everyone looked at each other and apart from Shui QianRou who was unconscious and Ling Chen who was still in Ling Tian\u2019s embrace, Xiao YanXue and Li Xue looked at each other before pointing at Ling Tian, \u201cYou go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Ling Jian, even though he is attentive, he is still lacking.\u201d Ling Tian grumbled under his breath as he looked at the four beauties in the carriage reluctantly. Li Xue did not forget to remind him, \u201cDon\u2019t forget to conceal your appearance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI shall not trouble old ma\u2019am for your concern!\u201d Outside the carriage, Ling Tian\u2019s frustrated voice could be heard.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

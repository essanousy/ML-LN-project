At the same time, the old men behind them had their eyes closed as though they were asleep and did not hear anything.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou was angered to the point her lips trembled and her eyes were about to spew out fire. She then said with a chilly tone, \u201cSince the three of you think that you are better than me and my brother, then we shall see how the three of you will be able to salvage the situation!\u201d Her words were said with an unyielding tone, and it was obvious that she was unwilling to back down.</p><br/><p>With Yu ManLou and Ling Tian\u2019s means, as well as the fact that they were not in their own territory, as long as the three of them were slightly careless, they would definitely die a horrible death. However, the three of them were still acting in such an arrogant manner and not placing Yu ManLou or Ling Tian in their sights.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou originally felt that since they were from the same family, as long as they did not go too far in the way they treated her and her brother, she would still give them timely reminders to ensure a route of escape. That way, she would have fulfilled her duty as a daughter of the Shui Family. However, the only emotion that filled her heart right now was anger and she no longer had any compassion towards the fate of these people in front of her!</p><br/><p><em>Let me see how all of you will die!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWe will definitely show you our abilities. At the same time, we must also put on a good show for the family!\u201d The three teens laughed in unison as they looked at the enraged Shui QianRou with mockery. At the same time, the teen in the middle even looked at her with a weird expression that carried a tinge of lasciviousness\u2026</p><br/><p>On the cliff, Ling Chen and Li Xue\u2019s expressions turned ugly as their gazes turned cold.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if the three of them wanted to insult Shui QianRou and Shui QianHuan. However, they should not have humiliated Ling Tian in their speech. This caused the two ladies on the cliff to burn with killing intent.</p><br/><p><em>After humiliating my beloved man, the three of you still want a \u2018good\u2019 show? If that\u2019s the case, I will definitely ensure the Shui Family\u2019s satisfaction! I will show them a good show that will make everyone in the Shui Family put on mourning clothes!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThe relationship between the younger generation of the Shui Family is \u2018fabulous\u2019 indeed.\u201d Li Xue clenched her teeth and looked at the three arrogant young men while coldly saying, \u201cThe three of them will definitely not make it back to Heavenly Wind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe three of them deserve to die!\u201d Ling Chen gnashed her teeth in rage.</p><br/><p>One of them said that the three of them wouldn\u2019t return while the other said that they would die. Unknowingly, the fate of these three individuals had been determined in that Heavenly Star Continent would be their final resting place.</p><br/><p>However, they did not notice anything as they racked their brains to come up with more sarcastic remarks to provoke and mock Shui QianRou. They tried to display their insignificant abilities by mocking their own cousins\u2026 Shui QianRou finally could not hold in her anger any longer and whipped her horse to speed up.</p><br/><p>Amid laughter and teasing, the 1,200 Shui Family members entered Sky Bearing City under Shui QianRou\u2019s lead! However, not a single one of them felt anything out of the ordinary, and they did not know that they had just entered the gates of hell\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that a family with such characters could be around for a thousand years. There isn\u2019t justice in the world anymore.\u201d Li Xue watched the departing figures of the Shui Family members and remarked, \u201cTo think that Shui QianRou is still able to think about the bigger picture and the interests of her family despite growing up in such an environment! Even I am filled with admiration!\u201d Li Xue then let out a sigh and thought to herself, From the ancient times until now, all of these so-called aristocratic families would make use of a lady\u2019s attachment and loyalty to the family and make them sacrifice themselves for the family. However, they had never thought about letting the males of the family make sacrifices for the family. Just how many ladies have been destroyed because of this?</p><br/><p>Even if a man were to sacrifice himself for the family and marry a woman who he doesn\u2019t love, he would still be able to take his beloved lady as a concubine or keep her as a mistress. At the end of the day, he would still be able to gain what belongs to him.</p><br/><p>But what about a woman in the aristocratic family? The moment she sacrifices herself and marries someone she doesn\u2019t love or even harms the one she loves, would any form of reparations be able to make up for her sacrifice? Women are emotional creatures after all, and after giving something out, it was impossible for them to take it back. After losing something, it would be impossible for them to regain it. Thus, beautiful women suffering unhappy fates is an unchangeable fact since the ancient times!</p><br/><p>Li Xue let out a sigh in her heart. Her admiration for Shui QianRou was one that came from the depths of her heart. In her past life, she was also like Shui QianRou who was tied down by the interests of her family and had to go against her own character and wishes! She did not have a single shred of freedom! In fact, she was even more resolute than Shui QianRou! Thus, Li Xue\u2019s enthusiasm could not help but be put out and a wave of heartache accompanied it.</p><br/><p><em>Is he currently safe?</em></p><br/><p>\u201cThe Shui Family is a thousand-year-old aristocratic family after all. The foundation of a thousand years is not something that the will of a woman would be able to go against.\u201d Ling Chen said with consideration.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi\u2026\u201d Li Xue sneered, \u201cWhat thousand-year-old aristocratic family? Little sister, even though you are extremely intelligent, you have only seen the strength of the family and the depths of its foundations. However, you have never thought about what was truly hidden within all of its glory. You have not truly experienced what goes on within an ancient aristocratic family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe inner secrets that are hidden within the shadows are dirty and ugly to the point people cannot imagine. The pain and torture that one goes through is something unbearable. They have been alive for a thousand years and have fought for a thousand years. At the same time, they have also decayed for a thousand years! There is no need to be afraid of them! There is nothing to be wary about! As long as we light a fire within their family, it will be enough to burn them all to death!\u201d Li Xue said with disdain towards the so-called thousand-year-old aristocratic family.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this be? It is impossible, right? They are a family that has been around for a thousand years after all!\u201d Ling Chen looked at Li Xue with shock and was completely dumbfounded. At the same time, the words that Li Xue had just said were still resounding in her mind, and she was unable to digest them. She could not help but think to herself, <em>Even if I have not truly experienced the inner workings of an aristocratic family, could it be that you have experienced it yourself?</em></p><br/><p>Ling Chen had never doubted Li Xue and the more she interacted with her, the more she felt that Li Xue was extremely unfathomable! Such a mysterious feeling was something that she had only felt from Ling Tian. Just what was the origin of this Miss Li Xue? Why was she so mysterious?!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it impossible?\u201d Li Xue pointed at the Shui Family members in the distance. \u201cFrom the conversation between the four of them and the silent attitude of the Shui Family elders, I can see that the inner conflict in the Shui Family has evolved to the point where it is a life and death struggle. It has evolved to the point where it can\u2019t be solved by a party taking a step back or compromising! Their current trip to Sky Bearing was definitely a decision of the next family head, and the party before our eyes is probably the party who has the upper hand in the Shui Family conflict. From this alone, it is obvious that it is far easier to deal with the Shui Family. After all, they do not have an iron-fisted family head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Yu Family has the ambitious Yu ManLou to suppress all parties with his cold-blooded and ruthless means. At the same time, he has the aid of his two brothers who are without ambition. However, the Shui Family does not have all of these. As such, there is no need to fear the Shui Family. Besides that,\u201d Li Xue said with a cunning grin, \u201cthey think that as long can come to Heavenly Star to produce some results, the position of successor would definitely be in their hands and they would be able to suppress Shui QianHuan for good. However, they never imagined that their appearance here is a part of Ling Tian\u2019s multi-layered plan and that it will be impossible for them to return alive. If it was just Shui QianRou and Shui QianHuan, the losses of the Shui Family wouldn\u2019t be too huge and they wouldn\u2019t be at the risk of destruction. At the same time, once the matters in Heavenly Star are concluded, the internal conflict in Heavenly Wind would definitely come to a conclusion as well. Despite that, to think that they would be foolish enough to send so many elites and three successor candidates as reinforcements. This was no different from seeking their doom! Why is there a need to fear such characters?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s face revealed a smile as she silently listened to Li Xue\u2019s analysis.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that I am an ignorant lass. Even though you look extremely honest, you have many tricks and schemes up your sleeves. As a capable aide personally groomed by Ling Tian, how honest could you possibly be?!\u201d Li Xue looked at Ling Chen and chuckled, \u201cIf not for your own plans to supplement Ling Tian\u2019s plans, even if the Shui Family was ambitious, they would not have sent so many reinforcements and definitely not successor candidates!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen revealed a smile and said, \u201cIn such chaotic times, I am only serving my lord. The young noble always said that the most important thing was for the people around him to be happy! In this life of mine, as long as young noble is able to lead a happy life, all of my sacrifice and effort will be worth it!\u201d Then she let out a long sigh as she looked towards the horizon, \u201cElder sister is right. I have not experienced the life in an aristocratic family, and in my heart, the heavens, earth, all of my actions, and all of my thoughts are only for young noble alone. I do not, and will not, place anyone else in my heart. This is what I think the happiness of a lady truly is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Li Xue looked at Ling Chen with envy, \u201cYou are truly luckier than any other lady in the world. Although you are only Ling Tian\u2019s maid, who would dare treat you like a maid? Your life and status in the Ling Residence are only second to Ling Tian and you have even more freedom and authority than those so-called \u2018little princesses\u2019. In the future\u2026\u201d Li Xue smiled mysteriously, \u201cDo you know what you will be doing in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I will be doing in the future?\u201d Ling Chen looked at Li Xue with bewilderment, \u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter Ling Tian unites the entire world, what do you think you will be doing?\u201d Li Xue replied with a bright smile, \u201cApart from you, who else would be fitting to have the title of Empress?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

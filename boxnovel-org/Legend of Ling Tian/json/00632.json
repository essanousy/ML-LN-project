How about we just rent a small boat and let you row us across?\u201d Ling Tian let out a snort as he joked towards Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>An embarrassed expression appeared on Ling Jian\u2019s face as he replied, \u201cI\u2019ve indeed not put enough thought into this. However, if we follow behind them, it will result in inconveniences on our part. Are we just going to tolerate it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian only let out a long sigh as he gazed at Ling Jian with the eyes used to look at an idiot. \u201cAh\u2019Jian, why is it that your IQ seems to have fallen to rock bottom today? If we swagger onto the continent just like that, wouldn\u2019t we end up as live targets? Even if your capabilities have reached the state of being on par with Justice, you still can\u2019t fight off an entire continent\u2019s worth of people, right? Heavenly Wind Continent is also the territory of the Shui Family, tens of thousands of people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian finally failed to rein in his emotions and turned red with embarrassment and shame as he hung his head down. However, this made him neglect the sly look that passed through Ling Tian\u2019s face at this moment. How dare this Ling Jian try to act cool in front of me. It\u2019s already good that I don\u2019t beat you to death on the spot! However, in this present age and time, probably only Ling Tian and a few other people would actually dare to insult the number one assassin like that!</p><br/><p>After waiting for another couple of days, Shui QianRou brought the remaining 400 odd members of the Shui Family as they sped towards Ling Tian\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou was at the vanguard, and her snow-white fur coat fluttered in the cold wind which matched her expression. Her eyes continuously roamed around her surroundings, as though searching for something.</p><br/><p>Just by looking at the position Shui QianRou was in currently, one would immediately understand that inside this group of 400 people, Shui QianRou had already obtained absolute authority over them. After the great battle that day, the remaining four elders as well as Shui QianHai and Shui QianHu no longer posed any threat towards her.</p><br/><p>With a whistle, all 400 men stopped their horses orderly. Shui QianRou straightened her back, anxiously looking around in her surroundings. A disappointed look flashed across her eyes and she waved her hands. A few of the Shui Family disciples withdrew long bugle horns, before blowing hard into them. The blare of the bugle sounded from all around them, traveling to the horizon.</p><br/><p>After a while, in the midst of the lush shrubbery of water plants, three huge ships slowly appeared, navigating towards where the Shui Family members were. At the same time, the flag on the ship was hoisted, and a huge \u2018Shui\u2019 word was proudly displayed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Princess, the ships are here, please board.\u201d A burly man jumped off the boat and saluted from afar.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou hesitated. That damned guy, why wasn\u2019t he here yet? Where did he run to this time? After this, the scenario would no longer be in her control!</p><br/><p>Having agreed with Ling Tian to meet him at this place, Shui QianRou could not help but feel a sense of loss at not even being able to catch a glimpse of his shadow. Tears threatened to flow out of her eyes at this point.</p><br/><p>However, a sudden teasing voice sounded softly near her, \u201cLittle Princess, the ships are already here. What are you waiting for? Could it be that you\u2019re waiting for your lover, hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou immediately flared up, but the next moment, her body stiffened as she turned around. Beside her, a foot soldier with a waxy complexion wagged his brows at her as he laughed, revealing a perfect set of pearly white teeth.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou heavily snorted, and putting on an angry expression, she spat, \u201cWho do you think you are, to question me as to when I want to board the ship? I\u2019ll personally come out with a punishment for you later! You will not be spared so easily!\u201d Saying this, she commanded, \u201cElders, board the second boat, and my two cousins the third. As for the disciples, a hundred of you will follow me to the first boat!\u201d</p><br/><p>The few elders sighed as they quietly walked towards the second boat. All of them were wily old foxes, so how could they not tell that Shui QianRou had already lost all respect for them in her eyes? However, this was them reaping what they sowed, and they could not blame it on anyone else.</p><br/><p>Shui QianHai evilly smiled as he spoke, \u201cLittle Sister, we\u2019re finally going back. Are you prepared?\u201d Before the ship came, he would not dare to say these words even if he were to be threatened with death. One had to know that in this year or so, Shui QianRou had perfectly cemented her position as the absolute head in Heavenly Star Continent, and if he dared to step out of line, Shui QianRou would not hesitate to take care of him!</p><br/><p>Originally, Shui QianHai thought that since their family\u2019s ships had arrived, then the final say would return to the elders. That was why he dared to open his mouth!</p><br/><p>However, Shui QianRou merely gave him a glare as she replied, \u201cWho are you to ask what I plan to do? I\u2019ll count to three, if by then you\u2019re not done with your nonsense and on the boat, then I\u2019ll leave you here to fend for yourself. See if I dare!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianHai flushed red with anger and embarrassment, and in his moment of impulse, wanted to rush up towards her to attack.</p><br/><p>At this time, Shui QianRou merely lifted up her right hand as she coldly spat out, \u201cOne!\u201d</p><br/><p>A tremor passed through his body when Shui QianHai saw her icy cold expression. Upon thinking how she had killed so ruthlessly in this period of time, he knew that if he did not choose the soft way and instead wanted to go head to head against her, Shui QianRou would definitely throw him down here. Viciously snorting, he turned around to board the third boat.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou stood outside her own room, staring frostily at the soldier who misspoke previously. In a stern voice, she snapped, \u201cThat brat who doesn\u2019t know how to respect his superiors, stay here! The rest of you, leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>The group immediately tucked their heads in, casting glances of pity at the unlucky fool and praying for him in their hearts. What luck, to anger the little princess just as they were returning\u2026</p><br/><p>No matter what was the case, they could not afford to lose themselves in joy. Everyone came to the same conclusion and shook their heads in schadenfreude as they left.</p><br/><p>There was a jerk and a shift and the sea began to churn as they moved off. The sails of the three ships were unfurled high up, fully catching the wind as they produced flapping sounds.</p><br/><p>Closing the room door, the fear on the waxy warrior\u2019s face suddenly vanished as he grinned, \u201cI\u2019ve come as promised. I\u2019m not sure how little princess plans to punish me? Are you going to treat me a lesson now? As to who is the master and who is the servant?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou returned the stare angrily, before suddenly bursting into laughter as she stepped forward and threw herself into his chest. Her tiny fists hammered repeatedly on his chest as though punishing\u2026 although it was completely ineffective\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that you would really not turn up\u2026 It scared me to death!\u201d With reddened eyes, Shui QianRou pouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I did not turn up\u2026 then wouldn\u2019t little princess not have anyone to punish in the first place?!\u201d That waxy faced person was actually Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Even if you came\u2026 I, I must still punish you! Who allowed you to scare me? Isn\u2019t it right that I get to punish you?\u201d Her head still stuck within his bosom, Shui QianRou threatened.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, when has our Princess Shui ever been wrong? This subordinate willingly accepts his punishment. Quickly punish me then!\u201d Ling Tian lecherously spoke. Following that, he immediately bent his head down and captured those tiny cherry lips of hers, and his hands moved to slither into her robes like a snake, caressing her smooth skin and capturing two proud and lofty rabbits.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s body softened, and she collapsed into Ling Tian\u2019s chest as though she did not have a single bone within her body. Her face was completely red, and her mesmerized eyes lightly closed shut even as her mouth vigorously responded\u2026</p><br/><p>It was only after a long time did the muffled voice of Ling Tian sound out, \u201c\u2026do you still wish to punish me? Little Princess, just how are you going to punish me, I\u2019m so scared thinking about it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026You, you\u2026 baddie!\u201d Shui QianRou was totally breathless at this point, her eyes dazed.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately applied some pressure to something in the middle of his fingers, and Shui QianRou immediately let out a breathy wail, her eyelashes fluttering.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo think that the proud and lofty little princess actually sent all her men on board after, so she could have an affair with her subordinate\u2026\u201d Leaning down towards her ear, Ling Tian lightly whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 that\u2019s not the case, don\u2019t\u2026 make blatant assumptions. I didn\u2019t do anything\u2026\u201d Shui QianRou still tried to resist.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo? Then what are we doing now?\u201d Ling Tian lightly bit onto her earlobe as his tongue flicked on it. His left hand was left caressing her chest as his right hand slowly explored down her smooth back, before suddenly and fiercely grabbing onto her pert buttocks, and giving in a good squeeze and knead.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou immediately let out a moan, and her legs clamped together. Her body lurched forward all of a sudden from the momentum, and her lips locked onto Ling Tian, her face drunken with pleasure.</p><br/><p>Tackling her from three different angles, Ling Tian now felt as though he was holding onto a ball of soft fluffy dough. He could not resist but whisper temptingly into her ear, \u201cLittle Princess, to have this subordinate serve you personally, do you feel good?\u201d</p><br/><p>The lady in question wiggled around sinuously like a snake, gripping him tightly as she stabilized herself on his body before moaning softly, \u201c\u2026feels good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you still dare to punish me in the future?\u201d Ling Tian immediately pressed his advantage</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 I don\u2019t dare anymore\u2026 I won\u2019t do it anymore\u2026!\u201d Shui QianRou was close to losing her sanity.</p><br/><p>\u201cEn, that good. In the future, only I can bully you and punish you! Who\u2019s the master and who\u2019s the servant, are you clear now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUp\u2026 to you. You can bully me however you want\u2026 and punish me\u2026 however you want\u2026\u201d The moment she finished speaking, her body suddenly tightened and went taut. Her mouth opened and bit hard onto Ling Tian\u2019s shoulder in order to stifle her moans, even as her body began to convulse\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt a sharp pain, and he did not know whether to laugh or cry as he looked at the beautiful woman in his arms. How could this be? He had barely started, and had just touched her a few times, as well as spoke a few words, but she actually\u2026 surrendered just like that?</p><br/><p>She\u2019s really too sensitive. Listening to the crash of the waves against the ship from the outside, a fire suddenly lit up in the depths of his eyes. Stretching out his hands, he manhandled the still panting Shui QianRou up into his arms as he walked towards the posh bed in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cN\u2026no!\u201d Shui QianRou could acutely feel what Ling Tian was attempting and immediately began to panic and struggle. \u201cRight now\u2026 we can\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re already comfortable, but I\u2019m feeling extremely pained\u2026\u201d Ling Tian stared at her with deep eyes, as he enticed. \u201cYou must know, this\u2026 I\u2019ve held it in for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill a no!\u201d Shui QianRou\u2019s face flushed red, but her expression remained resolute. \u201cIf I lose my maidenhood now\u2026 when I return, the family will immediately realize it, and that wouldn\u2019t be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what do we do?!\u201d Ling Tian felt as though his smaller self down below was on the verge of exploding. He wanted to cry but no tears would come out, if he knew this was going to happen, then he wouldn\u2019t have approached her to do such a thing! But now he was akin to an arrow nocked on a bowstring\u2026 She was probably going to kill him through blue balls!</p><br/><p>However, his eyes twinkled as a thought ran past his mind. He immediately put on an agonized expression as he cried out, \u201cIf we can\u2019t do that\u2026 then how about\u2026 you use\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Shui QianRou flushed red all the way to her neck, retorting on shame and embarrassment, \u201cNo way, how could I use\u2026\u201d She could not even say the final word before she buried herself into Ling Tian\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this won\u2019t do, and that won\u2019t do either, you\u2026 are you trying to murder your husband here?!\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s eyes displayed anxiety. What the f**k, could it be that even though this daddy here has so many peerless beauties by his side, he still had to use his five ladies [1] to do the job?</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it really\u2026 that painful?\u201d Shui QianRou bit on her full lips, hesitating for a long while before she finally lowered her head, whispering in a mosquito-like voice, \u201cThen\u2026 just this once.\u201d Her voice was barely a whisper, to the point if Ling Tian had not advanced in cultivation, he would definitely be unable to hear her speak. Even so, Shui QianRou was completely red the moment this sentence slipped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d Ling Tian was overjoyed. Hehe, after once, the moment there is a precedent, there will definitely be a second time!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s body began to tremble a little. \u201cThen\u2026 how do I do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me teach you. First, you kneel down\u2026 sitting will also do.\u201d Ling Tian could not wait to begin\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>After a long time, Ling Tian slowly walked out feeling refreshed, leaning on the railings of the ship as he watched it sail through the sea that was like a huge piece of blue-green jade. His emotions were extremely relaxed at this moment.</p><br/><p>From behind him, disorderly footsteps sounded as Shui QianRou walked over. The blush on her face had not faded even till now, and she coughed twice with her head lowered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Did you choke on something? It can\u2019t be that you\u2019re expecting, right? Am I going to be \u2018promoted\u2019?\u201d Ling Tian put on a face of concern.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs if it wasn\u2019t because of you\u2026 you baddie!\u201d Shui QianRou angrily threw him a glare, before her hand shot like a hidden weapon to his waist and pinching it hard. Then she decided it was insufficient to quell her anger, and immediately twisted the flesh she was holding.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face scrunched up together into a pile as he gritted his teeth and screamed, \u201cPAIN\u2026 you\u2019re too vicious! This punishment is too ruthless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou snorted hatefully, before coming up to his side. She allowed the wind to freely tousle her hair as she gazed at Ling Tian with a look of pride on her face, saying, \u201cHave you seen the ocean before? It\u2019s majestic, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seen the ocean before? Ling Tian felt a little giddy at the thought of this question. Lass, who do you think you\u2019re talking to? This young noble here even swam across the Pacific in his past life! Did you think that I had never seen an ocean before?</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I haven\u2019t. I was still thinking that it looks like a large river.\u201d He rubbed his nose, feeling a little miffed.</p><br/><p>\u201cRiver?\u201d Shui QianRou laughed so hard, her eyes turned into crescents. \u201cCould the river at your territory be so vast and without end? You bumpkin.\u201d She flirtatiously flicked at Ling Tian\u2019s head playfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cLass Rou, you might not think it true, but in at most five years, this ocean here will become a river, and I\u2019ll name it Quicksand River!\u201d Ling Tian replied a little matter-of-factly. However, a cunning gleam went unnoticed in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Shui QianRou spoke with absolute confidence. \u201cAn ocean is an ocean, so how could it turn into a river? Are you dreaming?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about we make a bet?\u201d The hint of a scheme grew even stronger in Ling Tian\u2019s smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine! Why would I not dare to bet on something that I\u2019ll win?\u201d Shui QianRou was smug. What a joke, even a god couldn\u2019t turn an ocean into a river, what more Ling Tian who was a mortal!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! If you win, then I\u2019ll listen to whatever you want to do in the future.\u201d Ling Tian grinned as he stroked his chin, expectant of the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if I lose?\u201d Shui QianRou\u2019s eyes gleamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you lose,\u201d Ling Tian let out an evil laugh, \u201cThen, whatever happened within the room just now, you\u2019re to provide it to me whenever I ask for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>[1] Five ladies refer to the fingers on one\u2019s hand.</p></div>\n</div>"}

They were Yu ManLou\u2019s two brothers: second brother Yu ManTang, and third brother Yu ManTian.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, is there really no need for us to send anyone to the Sky Bearing City? This is a one in a lifetime opportunity!\u201d The youngest of the three, Yu ManTian, was 30-plus years old man, with a face full of facial hair and straightforward looking appearance. He was the most impatient of the three and said hastily, \u201cAccording the Xue Leng\u2019s news, even those from \u2018Beyond Heaven\u2019 have arrived at the Sky Bearing City. Furthermore, all the different powers are treating the Sky Bearing City as a big chance and have sent their men there. If we do not make a choice, it will be too late. Big brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeyond Heaven?!\u201d Hearing this name, a chill gaze flashed past Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes, \u201cSo what? Just because Beyond Heaven is there, our Yu Family has to be there as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Idiot! Yu ManTang glared at Yu ManTian. You are really an idiot! Knowing that Beyond Heaven has always been a thorn in big brother\u2019s heart, you still had to pick such an unsuitable time to mention it! Even if big brother had the intention to send someone to the Sky Bearing City to appease us, it would probably be ruined by this single phrase of yours!</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother,\u201d Yu ManTang said carefully, \u201cit is extremely peaceful here and there isn\u2019t any news from Heavenly Wind. Furthermore, we have to guard against the news which we received from the palace a few days ago. The crown prince failed in his marriage proposal but still sent a large number of troops to the Sky Bearing City. I am afraid that he will harm BingYan. Why not you send us two brothers to infiltrate into the Sky Bearing City secretly with minimal followers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrown prince ChengPing?\u201d Yu ManLou sneered, \u201cHe is just a dancing clown and there is no need to fear him! If we treat him as a crown prince, he would be the crown prince. If we don\u2019t treat him as a crown prince, he would be nothing! He thinks that a rotten Martial Order Medallion will be able to protect him? That\u2019s nothing more than a dream! While other families may fear Beyond Heaven, our Yu Family has no need to fear any other power in the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides,\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s voice gradually became calm as the anger from hearing the words \u2018Beyond Heaven\u2019 disappeared, \u201cthe Sky Bearing City is filled with dangers and storms. I am still unable to understand the full situation, and it will be a huge risk to join in the fray rashly. I am even thinking if I should pull BingYan and the rest back to the Yu Family, and the both of you actually want to jump into the fray. Are all of you idiots?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, the matters in the Sky Bearing City is only a coincidence!\u201d Yu ManTian said with indignance, \u201cFor someone in the NanGong Family to die in such a sensitive period, it is definitely a coincidence. The powers from all over are going there to muddy the waters so they can get a share of the benefits. Just like what big brother said, the strength of our Yu Family is without any rival. As long as we appear, who would dare fight with us? We will definitely be the biggest winner! Big brother, how can you not consider the matter at all?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCoincidence? The Yu Family will be the biggest winner if we join in the fray? Preposterous!\u201d Yu ManLou pointed his finger at his third brother with anger and disappointment, \u201cYou, you, you\u2026 just when are you going to change this rash personality of yours? Whose territory is the Sky Bearing City? Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t know something so simple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhose territory? Isn\u2019t it that Yang KongQun\u2019s territory? What\u2019s the big deal about that? When this little brother here went to the Sky Bearing City back then, he even showed me magnificent hospitality. All these years, this little brother has been wanting to expand into the Sky Bearing Empire, but big brother has always been apprehensive about the matter. Is it really so important for us to keep the name of being a Great Family who does not have any ties to the empires? If we are able to enter the Sky Bearing Empire, the might of our Yu Family will definitely go up another level. At that time, what can that Beyond Heaven do\u2026\u201d Yu ManTian was full of conceit, rambling on about his opinions. However, he didn\u2019t manage to finish what he had to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up! You idiot!\u201d The usually calm and poise Yu ManLou was enraged to the point the veins by his temple bulged. With regards to this insensitive and rash brother of his, Yu ManLou was completely speechless! \u201cDid the both of you see the documents which I gave you a few days ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen it. Big brother, you mean\u2026\u201d Yu ManTang frowned. It was precisely because he had seen that document that he was so worried about his daughter in the Sky Bearing City.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich document? Errrrr\u2026 I\u2019ve seen it. Big brother, you are talking about the one regarding the Xiao Family, right?\u201d Seeing Yu ManLou blowing his top, Yu ManTian tried his best to appease his rage, letting out a feigned sigh, \u201cI really never expected that the strength of the Xiao Family would grow so quickly. The world is really like a chess game, difficult to predict what would happen next\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>By the side, Yu ManTang\u2019s face was completely ashen! He looked towards Yu ManTian with a face full of pity as he could not help but sigh in his heart, \u201cThird brother, forgive your second brother for being unable to help you. You have really smashed into the hornet\u2019s nest this time! Haiz, even if you don\u2019t know what is going on, you should not spout nonsense. Now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c&amp;)[email\u00a0protected]*[email\u00a0protected])\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes were already as wide as saucers. The usually composed and well-tempered Yu ManLou would always be driven mad by this dear brother of his! After a long while, he roared, \u201cBastard!! Who asked you to see that?! If not for the fact that the three of us are the only ones of our generation, I would really want to take out the family laws to teach you a good lesson!\u201d</p><br/><p>This roar was comparable to the \u2018Lion Roar\u2019 of the Shaolin Temple from Ling Tian\u2019s previous life! The whole mansion of the Yu Family shook from the roar!</p><br/><p>While Yu ManTian was extremely unbridled, he had a lot of respect for his big brother. He also knew that his big brother was at least a hundred times better than him. Thus, he conceded in both his mouth and heart immediately! Without asking for the reason, he lowered his head to seek forgiveness. In actual fact, he was completely ignorant as to where he went wrong!</p><br/><p>Looking at this third brother of his which gave him so much headache, Yu ManLou let out a weak sigh and waved his hands for the both of them to be seated. He then glared at Yu ManTian, \u201cYou better sit down there quietly without saying a single word. If not, you can scram!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian replied with an \u2018err\u2019 as he was depressed in his heart. At the same time, he thought to himself, \u201cDespite the momentum of my cultivation, I read the news which you sent to me without delay. I really did read everything that you sent me\u2026\u201d All of a sudden, his body shook and thought about how someone did indeed send him some document to read when he was cultivating. However, he was in meditation and so he commanded for it to be placed by the side. In the end, he was too engrossed in his cultivation and had completely forgotten about the matter. Could it be that document? Thinking about that, he did not dare to say a single word, sitting by the side like an obedient kitten.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou then looked towards Yu ManTang and said, \u201cSecond brother, you know about the matter. What opinions do you have with regards to the Sky Bearing City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang thought about the matter carefully before replying, \u201cNanGong Le\u2019s death is definitely not a mere coincidence. I believe that someone must have intentionally instigated the whole affair to reap benefits from the whole matter. However, the person, or power, who instigated this affair is still unknown. But despite that, this is definitely a huge chance to the various powers! This is without doubt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou let out a sigh and looked at both his brothers. One was rash and addicted to martial arts. The other one was sharp when it came to small matters but muddled when it came to large affairs. He then said with a serious tone, \u201cAll of you! Haiz!\u201d Turning around to look outside the window, he said with a mellow tone, \u201cThis is definitely a good opportunity. It is definitely a huge opportunity! You guys are not the only ones to think about this. All the other powers would have definitely thought about this as well. Thus, they are all running to the Sky Bearing City like flies seeing candy! However, have you even wondered if there is someone controlling this whole affair from the background? If there is really someone controlling the whole affair, who would this person be? What is his motive? Why would he be so kind-hearted to create such an opportunity for all the various powers? What exactly are his intentions? Have you guys ever thought about these things?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang blinked for a moment before replying, \u201cBig brother, I know that you are suspecting that silkpants. However, this little brother thinks that this matter may not be controlled by him. How will he be able to control such a huge affair with his capabilities. Perhaps it may just be a mere coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said it before, you are not allowed to call him silkpants!\u201d Yu ManLou flared, \u201cIf he is a silkpants, what can you two be considered to be? It is extremely foolish for you to underestimate an enemy like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr, big brother, second brother, who are you guys talking about?\u201d Yu ManTian could not help but ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian, grandson of Ling Zhan, son of Ling Xiao.\u201d Yu ManTang replied softly. Yu ManTian was speechless for a short while before replying, \u201cBig brother, both you and second brother have your talents. I only like martial arts and my brain isn\u2019t very clear. However, what is there to discuss about that little fellow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was speechless again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is definitely something which we are still unable to understand. Even if we can\u2019t understand it, I can feel that this so-called chance may be a huge trap!\u201d Yu ManLou frowned, \u201cFurthermore, I suspect that this trap is laid specially for our Yu Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, big brother, in the world today, who is capable of plotting against our Yu Family? Even those fellows from Beyond Heaven may not be able to do so. Furthermore, even if someone dares to plan against us, can they possibly succeed? At the very most, this little brother here will take a few white jades over to destroy the Ling Family!\u201d Yu ManTian shouted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou?\u201d Yu ManLou glanced at his own third brother, \u201cEven if you bring all of your purple jade and white jade men under you, I won\u2019t be surprised if all of you won\u2019t be able to leave the Sky Bearing City!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

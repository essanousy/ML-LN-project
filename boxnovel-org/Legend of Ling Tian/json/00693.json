Besides, Miss Xiao only turned out this way to save you\u2026 Of course, if you feel troubled, we can forget about this matter! You can allow her to enter her afterlife with her chaste body. It shall be your own choice!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face flushed red as he stammered, \u201cI\u2026 how am I someone like that? Miss Xiao turned out this way in order to save me, how can I watch by the side without doing anything? Wouldn\u2019t I be worse than a beast?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was overjoyed in his heart and was waiting for those words from Ling Jian. He then continued calmly, \u201cWhat are you waiting for? This matter cannot be delayed! The longer you drag it out, the more dangerous her internal injuries will be. Quickly follow me and find a quiet place for you to treat Miss Xiao\u2019s injuries. I will guard the two of you. The most important matter at hand would be to treat her critical injuries!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice was about to be done with matters and with his wisdom he would definitely be able to see through this plot. Ling Tian wasn\u2019t willing to let this medical saint interfere in his plans.</p><br/><p>Besides, while Xiao YouHan\u2019s injuries were severe, they definitely weren\u2019t fatal. If she ends up waking up\u2026</p><br/><p>Indeed, the moment Ling Tian said those words, Ling Jian became anxious. Looking at Xiao YouHan\u2019s complexion, Ling Jian felt as though her complexion took a turn for the worse and her breathing became heavier\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJust this alone wouldn\u2019t be enough and it would only be able to save her life. If things go wrong, there may be severe repercussions and she may be paralyzed for life!\u201d A crisp voice could be heard. However, the voice seemed to be holding something in with great difficulty. This voice belonged to Justice. He then said slowly with the sagacious aura of a medical saint, \u201cIf you want to ensure that she makes a full recovery, you have to adjust her Yin with your Yang, the heavens and earth becoming one, and ensure that both vital Yin and vital Yang becomes one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was startled, \u201cAh? Really?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian glared at Justice and scolded, \u201cLecher!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice smiled in response, \u201cYou are talking about yourself right?! Ling Jian let me tell you, actually\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian quickly corrected himself and interrupted Justice, \u201cLing Jian, it was my oversight previously and Senior Justice\u2019s words are right. Quickly follow me and find a quiet place to save her in case anything goes wrong.\u201d He then pulled Ling Jian out and did not bother saying anything else to Justice.</p><br/><p>When the two figures departed, Justice\u2019s solemn face suddenly burst out into laughter as he muttered to himself, \u201cThis Ling Tian is truly too\u2026 talented!\u201d</p><br/><p>In a small room at the Above Heavens sect, the windows and doors were shut tight. Ling Tian was currently patrolling the vicinity as he eavesdropped on what was going on in the room.</p><br/><p>In the room, Ling Jian seemed to be hesitating before the sound of clothes being taken off sounded. Ling Tian\u2019s brows were raised in excitement and he could not help but clap his hands. A long while later, Ling Jian\u2019s heavy breathing could be heard as though he was exerting a great deal of force. Ling Tian held onto his stomach and laughed soundlessly until his sides ached.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden a \u2018PA!\u2019 sound could be heard as though someone was slapped hard in the face. An embarrassed cry could then be heard, \u201cLecher! What are you doing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s flustered voice could be heard, \u201cI.. I\u2026 I\u2026 I am trying to\u2026 to save\u2026 save you\u2026 don\u2019t misunderstand\u2026 you are severely injured and\u2026 this is the only way to save you. I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWu wu wu\u2026\u201d The sound of whimpering could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 that\u2026 I\u2026\u201d Ling Jian sounded like he wanted to give an explanation but couldn\u2019t say a thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow will I have the face to meet anyone in the future? Wuwuwu\u2026 I\u2026 I don\u2019t want to live anymore! Wuwuwu\u2026\u201d The lady\u2019s voice was full of grief.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian gave her a thumbs up. Fantastic! She is truly fantastic! These are truly the best words to say at this moment.</p><br/><p>After stammering for a long time, Ling Jian finally managed to force some words out, \u201cI.. I was really trying to treat your injuries\u2026\u201d His voice became softer and softer, knowing that he was in the wrong. At this moment, Ling Jian finally realized that he had never heard about such a treatment method before\u2026</p><br/><p>However, Ling Jian was previously too flustered with worry and could not be bothered about whether the treatment method was logical\u2026</p><br/><p>Hearing those words, the voice of the woman became louder and was filled with grief and anger, \u201cTreat my injuries? For you to treat my injuries in such a manner, you are defiling my innocence. I might as well die! Wu wu wu\u2026 I am the daughter of a good family. How can I let you trample over my innocence like that? You\u2026 you lecher!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am really not a lecher!\u201d Ling Jian was truly exasperated, \u201cI\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2026 why don\u2019t I\u2026 I take responsibility for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cResponsibility? How will you take responsibility?\u201d The female voice continued. Ling Tian who was on the outside was full of praise.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 how about I marry you? Would that be enough?\u201d Ling Jian\u2019s pitiful voice sounded. Without even looking, Ling Tian knew that this subordinate of his was definitely had a face covered with sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 lecher! You\u2026 you\u2026 why does it seem like you are suffering a huge loss?! Do you think this Miss cares about that? Hmph! If you are so unwilling\u2026\u201d The woman\u2019s voice whined with a tinge of embarrassment and anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 no.. it isn\u2019t a loss, it isn\u2019t a loss.\u201d Ling Jian said, \u201cI\u2026 I earned\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice of extreme embarrassment sounded as she reprimanded, \u201cAre you doing a business deal? What do you mean by earning or losing? Fool!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026 hehehe\u2026\u201d A wave of foolish laughter could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cTurn around!\u201d Xiao YouHan\u2019s voice sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Ling Jian was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I am going to put on my clothes!\u201d Xiao YouHan flew into a rage, \u201cTurn around, you pig!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr err\u2026 oh oh oh\u2026\u201d Ling Jian hurriedly nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Following which, the sound of clothes rustling could be heard followed by a long period of silence. Following which, the two of them whispered to each other but Ling Tian couldn\u2019t hear those words clearly. Just when he was about to circulate his inner qi to eavesdrop, he heard a wave of \u2018pa pa pa\u2019 sounds.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately retreated a couple of feet away and covered his ears with disgust, \u201cIsn\u2019t their progression too fast? The sheer speed of their progression is superior to even this young noble\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian hid in a corner sneakily as he looked around carefully. If someone found out that the world famous young noble Ling Tian was eavesdropping on his number one subordinate, he would truly be embarrassed!</p><br/><p>A long while later, the door creaked open and Ling Jian walked out full of energy. He didn\u2019t seem as though he had just been through a large battle and was full of energy with his spirits high. He looked as though he would be able to defeat two elephants even they were placed before him!</p><br/><p>Xiao YouHan followed behind with her face flushed red as she twiddled with the corner of his shirt. Her face was lowered as she looked at her dressing carefully afraid that her clothes would look messy and get teased by others. While her lips were pouted angrily, the joy in her eyes betrayed her true emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, young noble, are you still there? Miss Xiao is alright. I have saved her already. Young noble\u2026\u201d Ling Jian cried out gleefully the moment he exited the room. How could he not share such a joyful matter with the young noble?</p><br/><p><em>Pig! You are a pig! </em>Ling Tian cursed in his heart. <em>How could Ling Jian call out for him the moment he comes out? Isn\u2019t this akin to openly saying that there was someone keeping guard on the outside when her injuries were being \u2018treated\u2019? How would a lady like her be able to face anyone in the future?</em></p><br/><p>If Xiao YouHan had some doubts and asks a few questions, she would be able to easily find out this matter was Ling Tian\u2019s doing. From the beginning to the end, it was all part of Ling Tian\u2019s plans. At that time, things would truly be awkward\u2026</p><br/><p>However, since Ling Jian had already cried out for him, it would be even more suspicious if he didn\u2019t appear. Helpless, he could only reluctantly walk out. \u201cI am over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAH?!!!\u201d Indeed, a loud gasp could be heard and Xiao YouHan\u2019s face changed color as she looked at Ling Tian, \u201cYoung noble Ling\u2026 Crown Prince Ling\u2026 was outside? Then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian had a big smile on his face as he continued, \u201cIf not for young noble guarding the place for us, your injuries wouldn\u2019t have recovered so quickly. Senior Justice had even asked me to ensure that the heavens and earth become one but you were okay before I even did so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPIG! You are a pig! Stupid pig!\u201d Xiao YouHan\u2019s face was completely red and she began pinching Ling Jian all over in frustration and embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 ah ah\u2026 cough\u2026 you two continue\u2026 Mmm, you guys continue and I shall take my leave.\u201d This was naturally the best time for him to make his escape. After leaving behind those words, Ling Tian escaped.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face contorted in pain as a pair of dainty hands pinched him all over his arms, shoulders, back, thighs\u2026 360 degrees in a single pinch\u2026 180 degrees\u2026 720 degrees\u2026</p><br/><p>Err\u2026 some details are best left out\u2026</p><br/><p>The next day morning.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the Green Ripple Immortal Park still had smoke rising up from many areas and the previously beauty of the place was completely destroyed! There wasn\u2019t the slightest bit of elegance from before!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stood on top of the wall and let out a long sigh as he looked around.</p><br/><p>After a full night of battle, not only was Above Heavens wiped out from the face of the continent, the Xiao Family was also wiped out alongside it! The past number one financial magnate in the world had been reduced to such a state!</p><br/><p>Both Ling Chen and Li Xue walked over like two fairies. In the battle last night, the three of them had split up to watch over a separate district. Looking at the expression on both of their faces, Ling Tian knew that nothing went wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the battle last night, everything in the Western Courtyard went well! Of the 313 Above Heavens disciples, not a single one escaped alive. Two hundred and ninety of them were killed on the spot and 23 captured. However, about a hundred odd individuals from the Western Courtyard died. Thankfully, the few important individuals were safe.\u201d Li Xue said calmly.</p></div>\n</div>"}

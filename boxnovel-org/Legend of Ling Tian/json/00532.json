At that time, there will definitely be men from Bright Jade City coming to fetch them. As such, our operation will also be set to two days later. You will bring the Shui Family experts to attack the Yu Family while I make use of that opportunity to search for the three Shui brothers. When you return, I will hand them over to you and allow you to determine how to deal with them. You can also fulfill your brother\u2019s final wish at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s fists clenched up tightly and her thin veins could be seen protruding out from her fair skin. At the same time, a dense killing intent shot out from her eyes!</p><br/><p>Ling Chen heaved a sigh of relief in her heart and smiled sweetly, \u201cYounger sister Rou, take good care of brother QianHuan. With regards to ambushing the Yu Family two days later, your Shui Family can come up with the plan yourselves. At that time, I will send someone to give you accurate information! I will be leaving now.\u201d She then waved her hands and left without waiting for Shui QianRou\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>On the third morning, the First Elder, Yu ZhanShui, and Third Elder, Yu ZhanKong, came to the Ling Residence to exchange pleasantries. They first thanked the Ling Family for their care in this period and made a sincere apology for the actions of their Yu Family during this period. After that, they then tactfully requested approval to bring back all of their earnings in Sky Bearing to Bright Jade City. Then, they emphasized how both the Ling and Yu Families were in-laws and would always be friendly towards each other for generations to come. Finally, they requested for the Ling Family to take good care of the Yu Family\u2019s little princess and instructed that they must definitely go to Bright Jade City with Ling Tian and Yu BingYan after the grand wedding\u2026</p><br/><p>The two Ling Family elders were not simple characters either and also said the necessary pleasantries. They first hosted the two Yu Elders with great hospitality before urging them to continue their stay with great sincerity. After the two Yu Elders insisted on their departure, the two Ling elders then swore that their Ling Family would always be on friendly terms with the Yu Family for generations to come and that they wouldn\u2019t allow the Yu Family\u2019s little princess to suffer any grievances. After which, they offered to set up a banquet to send the two Yu Elders off and after the two Yu Elders rejected them politely, the two parties bade their farewells unwillingly and with great reluctance. The touching scene of the two groups parting with reluctance seemed to have come completely from the heart and was an extremely moving sight. Everyone watching from the side could not help but praise the elders for being extremely emotional individuals!</p><br/><p>The eyes of all the elders had all turned red as though they were truly the best of friends. Old Madam Ling even mentioned the fact that they were all turning old and after the parting this time, they may no longer be able to meet each other again. These words made the few elders extremely sentimental as they almost hugged each other in grief.</p><br/><p>After finally sending off the Yu Family\u2019s troops and seeing them disappearing in the distance, Old Madam Ling turned around and all signs of grief disappeared completely. She then threw away the ginger slice that she had hid in her sleeves and a malevolent look could be seen in her eyes. After spitting out a ball of spittle, she cursed the old fellows of the Yu Family for being shameless b<em>st</em>rds. It wouldn\u2019t matter if they only came to Sky Bearing to eat and live for free. But after freeloading off their Ling Family, these Yu Family b<em>st</em>rds had almost shifted the whole Sky Bearing City away! She then swore with agitation that she must definitely snatch back every last copper coin that the Yu Family stole! If there was even a copper coin short, she would definitely fight her way to Bright Jade City and seek an explanation from Yu ManLou! Chu Ting\u2019er who had watched the whole process could not help but break out in cold sweat and was filled with admiration towards her mother-in-law\u2019s valor. No wonder her father-in-law didn\u2019t dare to have a single concubine! Her mother-in-law was truly the role model for all ladies!</p><br/><p>Of course, with regards to how Grand Marshal Ling didn\u2019t have a single concubine, Chu Ting\u2019er would not attribute it to her fierceness. She attributed it to the fact that Ling Xiao had an extremely high level of self-awareness and even if he was surrounded by three thousand beauties, he would only remain loyal to her. As compared to her frivolous son, her husband was far better. When that brat eats what is in the bowl, he would think about what is in the pot. When he is looking at what is in the pot, he would think about what is by the side of the pot. When looking at what is by the side of the pot, he would be thinking of what is far off. Err, in comparison, her own Ling Xiao was the role model for all guys in this aspect.</p><br/><p>Of course, after Yu ZhanShui and Yu ZhanKong stepped out of Sky Bearing City, their fictitious expression could finally be relaxed as they began cursing the two Ling elders for being extremely difficult to deal with. The hypocritical smile that was plastered all over the Ling elders\u2019 face made all of their hair stand up in disgust. Even if you want to feign sadness and grief, why did you have to use a slice of ginger? Even if you had to use it, why did you have to drag the conversation on for such a long time causing the smell of the ginger to spread all around and causing our eyes to suffer as well? How irritating, despicable and shameless! At the same time, the two Yu Elders were also extremely delighted. After all, they had swept away a large fortune from Sky Bearing in their present trip.</p><br/><p>The treasures that they had raked in through every possible means was almost comparable to half a year of revenue for the Yu Family! With this fortune by their side, their Yu Family would definitely have a larger chance at ruling over the world! Their merit this time definitely couldn\u2019t be overlooked!</p><br/><p>As such, amid the delighted cheering, the more than a thousand Yu Family experts chattered happily along their journey back home with immense satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Their return journey to Bright Jade City was only 1200 miles and their family would send someone to fetch them back halfway. There was no risk or danger involved and they would definitely have a smooth journey home! The Yu Family\u2019s experts were already planning their future marriages and fantasies that they had never able to fulfill\u2026 As such, every now and then, lecherous laughter could be heard among the Yu Family\u2019s troops. None of them could be bothered about the fact that their horses were already exhausted from the heavy load of their riches.</p><br/><p>From time to time, there would be a few brothers incapable of controlling their excitement and would let out a loud wolf-like howl to the heavens. The rest of the Yu Family members would then laughingly scold those crazy fellows. There were even a few fellows who would hop onto the back of their horses, take of their pants and whip out their tool. While shaking their ass and making a funny face, they would then shoot a water arrow at the Sky Bearing City afar. After a wave of laughter, there would be some others who would even mimic such an action\u2026 There was someone who had even claimed that even if there was a piece of leather in front of him, he wouldn\u2019t need any hands or feet to puncture a hole within it. All he had to do was to raise his waist\u2026</p><br/><p>The wheels of the carriages go round and round, with the horses all in misery and gold hanging down from all the passengers. After returning from Sky Bearing, they would all be able to choose their wife from a hundred ladies\u2026</p><hr/><br/><p>In front of them was a relatively long and narrow mountain pass. After passing through it and making another turn, they would be at the Black Pine Forest!</p><br/><p>The Black Pine Forest wouldn\u2019t be too far from the Nine Swallow City and after the Nine Swallow City, they would be in the Northern Wei territory!</p><br/><p>The sky was gloomy and it looked as though it was about to rain at any time. But in the hearts of the Yu Family members, they only felt the cool winds and thought that it was the best possible weather. Thus, the gloomy skies did not dampen any of their high spirits as they excitedly continued on their journey.</p><br/><p>At the peak of a tall pine tree that could reach the clouds, a black figure silently concealed herself. This position was the highest point in the surrounding few miles and was a full three hundred feet above the ground! If one were to look down from this high vantage point, one would truly be able to see everything in the surrounding miles without anything escaping one\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>The black-robed figure was extremely skinny and was flexible as though she did not have bones. In her bright eyes, it was as though the starry night could be seen and she was Li Xue!</p><br/><p>Originally, Li Xue didn\u2019t intend to take action this time but she just could not be at ease to leave Shui QianRou who was overall in charge of the mission alone. Thus, she stealthily followed the troops after they left in order to prepare for the worst. No matter what, nothing must happen to Shui QianRou!</p><br/><p>The most amusing thing was that a dozen feet away from Li Xue, there were three \u2018first-rate\u2019 experts of the Shui Family lying in ambush. They each had a bow in their hands as they observed the road nervously. They had arrived at their spot before Li Xue, and Li Xue had even passed by over the top of their heads, but the three of them did not notice the slightest bit of oddity. The way Li Xue saw it, they were like the hero Qiu ShaoYun who would not move even if they were being burned by fire.</p><br/><p>The sound of the Yu Family troops laughing heartily and teasing each other could be heard from afar. Mmm, the Yu Family\u2019s experts were slowly approaching the Black Pine Forest and facing the dense and thick forest, the troops entered without the slightest bit of hesitation. It was as though they never imagined there to be a life-threatening ambush hiding within at all!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou was clad in black robes and hiding at the top of another pine tree. She gripped her sword tightly and her palm was already covered in a layer of sweat. Just a few months ago, she was chased by Justice in this very forest because of a treasure before being ambushed by two Yu Elders. All of her capable subordinates had perished in this very forest and Ling Tian then appeared to kill the two Yu Elders before making her and Die\u2019er his captives.</p><br/><p>It seems like her interaction with Ling Tian had also truly begun here!</p><br/><p>After a few months, the situation was completely different. The one lying in ambush now was Shui QianRou and the victims were the Yu Family\u2019s experts! However, the location had not changed and the time also seemed to be the same. The miraculous happenings of the world truly cannot be predicted. Would Ling Tian who had made a sudden appearance the last time appear again today? If he appears today, would he help her?!</p><br/><p>Thinking about Ling Tian, Shui QianRou\u2019s originally hopeless heart suddenly softened before she felt a tinge of pain. Just where are you? If you appear in front of me right now, I would definitely admit my mistakes and stubbornness before asking you for some advice about what I should do right now. What can my Shui Family do to prevent destruction? I am really extremely fatigued and can no longer see hope before my eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>The leading troops of the Yu Family had entered the dense forest and the back of the Yu Family troops also slowly entered the forest! However, the thousand plus troops still acted as in an extremely carefree manner as though they were here on vacation. On top of the tree, Li Xue could not help but be amazed at just how brainless these more than a thousand Yu Family\u2019s troops were. She had seen brainless people before but had never seen a thousand of them gathering together at the same spot. What a magnificent scene\u2026 In such a dangerous place, they were actually bold to the point that they did not send any scouts to sweep the area once. It was about as smart as kicking their own heads around like a football! Miss Li Xue\u2019s horizons were truly broadened this time!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He then looked at Justice and asked, \u201cI wonder what you think?\u201d Seeing that Justice remained silent, he smiled before retreating into the Lei Family\u2019s camp. With his arms spread open, he shouted, \u201cYou should be extremely clear about the situation of the battle already. The Ling Family no longer has the ability to defend themselves but my Lei Family still has 1800 Death Warriors left. Death Warriors who are absolutely loyal to my Lei Family! The Ling Family Courtyard must be destroyed today! Even if you take action, how many people can you save? Even if you are the number one expert in the world, can you fight a thousand experts alone?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice looked at Lei ZhenTian with a tinge of playfulness and said casually, \u201cYou mean to say\u2026 this seat\u2019s words aren\u2019t worth anything?\u201d While his tone was casual, his immense aura gushed out uncontrollably and everyone present could feel Justice\u2019s roaring rage.</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian\u2019s eyes darted around for a moment before finally making a decision, \u201cThe Ling Family Courtyard is going to be destroyed today. Forgive Lei ZhenTian for not being able to obey your orders.\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice laughed from extreme anger and said coldly, \u201cAlright then, let me take a good look. With me around today, who dares to touch the Ling Family?! While I cannot fight a thousand people alone, I will definitely be able to reap the lives of everyone who takes action. So what if I am not able to kill all of you today?! Does Family Head Lei really think that this seat is incapable of that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian\u2019s countenance was cold but his tone was filled with a tinge of bitterness, \u201cLing Tian is extremely despicable and is the common enemy of everyone in the world. He is the biggest plague to the world and had even boasted about killing you. Why do you have to befriend your enemy and aid him in his misdoings? Our Lei Family is helping the world seek justice today to wipe out this venomous Ling Tian for the good of the world! We naturally do not need to be apprehensive about our means. As long as you do not interfere with matters today, be it my Lei Family or Northern Wei\u2019s Yu Family, we will be eternally grateful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian finally chose to bring out the Yu Family as well. If Lei ZhenTian were to stop now and retreat his forces, the Ling Family Courtyard would definitely be able to regain their strength in a short amount of time and the dangers would be endless. The most frustrating thing was the fact that Lei ZhenTian was initially extremely full of confidence and wanted to wipe out the Ling Family with the smallest possible price. However, he never imagined he would lose five elders the moment the fight began! Currently, even after losing almost half of his forces, the fight was still in a stalemate and he was unable to take down the Ling Family Courtyard! If he was unable to wipe out the Ling Family Courtyard after paying such a huge price and sacrificing his son, he would no longer have the face to meet his Lei Family and the rest of the world. Besides that, if he was unable to live up to his end of the deal, the Yu Family would not take him seriously anymore.</p><br/><p>After finally gaining the upper hand in the battle and when victory was almost in his grasp, his son died a mysterious death and the Martial Order Medallion owner Justice had even appeared to support the Ling Family.</p><br/><p>As the family head of the Lei Family, how would Lei ZhenTian not know the strength of Justice? Even the powerful and arrogant Yu Family didn\u2019t dare to let out a single sound when their number one expert was killed by Justice! Lei ZhenTian definitely did not dare to, nor did he have the ability to provoke Justice! Since he was unable to retreat either, he could only play the Yu Family card. After all, the Yu Family had already taken over half the continent and was no longer the same. He hoped that Justice would be able to consider the combined strength of both their families and take a step back. Of course, if Justice still refused to take a step back, Lei ZhenTian would have no choice but to gather his experts to tangle with Justice while the rest of his Lei Family troops finished off the remnants of the Ling Family Courtyard. As long as the brains of the Ling Family Courtyard were destroyed, so what if Justice could fight a thousand people alone?</p><br/><p>As long as he could wipe out the Ling Family Courtyard, even if he had to offend Justice, it would still be worthwhile. At the very least, he would be able to take revenge for his son. Furthermore, as long as the Yu Family could rule over the continent, their Lei Family could borrow the strength of the Yu Family to amend their ties with Beyond Heavens in future.</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable! You are obviously the one trying to take advantage of our demise and you can actually speak with such self-righteousness? Lei ZhenTian, there isn\u2019t a need for a despicable family like yours to remain on the continent!\u201d Ling Chen stood up straight with fire burning in her eyes as she announced, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, the Ling Family will accept your battle! I, Ling Chen, as the temporary Ling Family Head will swear on behalf of my husband Ling Tian: Regardless of the results of the battle today, the Lei Family will no longer have any place in three months time! Three months from today, there won\u2019t be anyone in this world with the surname of Lei!\u201d</p><br/><p>None of them could imagine that such vicious words would actually come out from the usually gentle Ling Chen. Her words were filled with blood-lust and everyone who carried the surname of Lei would have to face the bloodiest revenge from the Ling Family from today onward! Even if the Lei Family was willing to retreat right now, the Ling Family would not let the matter rest so easily!</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian humiliating the Ling Family and Ling Tian had already ignited the frightening killing intent in Ling Chen\u2019s heart!</p><br/><p>Justice himself was also puzzled as he murmured, \u201cThis lass looks extremely wise. Why would she make such a silly mistake? I am only capable of instilling some fear into the Lei Family troops but if we were really going to fight, while no harm would fall upon me, the Ling Family members who are all exhausted would surely not be able to escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when Justice was about to make his stance known again to pressure the Lei Family members, he was stunned for a moment as he extended his senses. He then could not help but smile as he thought, \u2018No wonder this lass took such a hard stance. It turns out that their true master is back. This brat\u2019s movement techniques have also quickly improved and he was almost able to hide from my ears.\u2019</p><br/><p>A clear voice, with some fatigue and boundless killing intent, sounded, \u201cWell said! From today on, there won\u2019t be a Lei Family on the continent! May the heavens and earth be my witness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this voice, all the remaining survivors of the Ling Family Courtyard cheered loudly in unison!</p><br/><p>All of the fatigued and injured soldiers, regardless of how severe their injuries were, as long as they could move, they stood up with their comrades supporting them. Looking at this figure, their eyes blazed with fighting spirit!</p><br/><p>Under the thick layer of protection by the Ling Family troops, both Shui QianRou and Yu BingYan hugged each other with tears of joy. They who were already completely worn out finally collapsed onto the ground as though they were relieved of a great burden and had entered a sanctuary. The immense pressure had vanished. The fear of death had also vanished. Only the dense fatigue was left behind and everything else would be left to that person to handle. The only thing that they had to do was to rest. This was the hope that he brought.</p><br/><p>Ling Lei, Ling Dian and the rest were all riddled with injuries and already on the brink of collapsing. But the moment that voice sounded, it was as though they had steroids injected into them and they all got up from the ground and cheered gleefully!</p><br/><p>A black figure slowly floated down from the walls of the Ling Family Courtyard as though he was weightless. The scorching noon sun was blocked by this black figure and while he was alone, his presence seemed to have brought darkness to the entire world. It was as though his very existence was superior to even the sun up in the sky!</p><br/><p>This black figure drifted a full three hundred feet without even touching the ground and landed in front of Ling Chen. His brows like swords were furrowed and his killing intent shot to the heavens! The one who had such superior movement techniques was naturally Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had returned!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s robes were still covered with dried-up bloodstains from the previous night\u2019s battle. He had rushed over without even changing out of his dirty robes. After entering the city, he first paid a visit to the Ling Residence to check on his family members who were hiding in the secret underground chamber. He did not even have the time to comfort them before immediately leaving for the Ling Family Courtyard.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face was currently slightly pale. After experiencing a huge battle last night he switched horses three times along the way just so he could rush over. For the last ten miles of the road, his horse died from fatigue and he had no choice but to use his supreme movement techniques to rush over at full speed. His speed was akin to a shooting star but the exhaustion of his inner qi was also a great burden to his body.</p><br/><p>At this moment, this was perhaps the frailest moment of Ling Tian\u2019s life! Even when he fought Justice in both strength and wit, he had never been so exhausted and weak!</p><br/><p>Seeing how Ling Chen and the rest who he had been worried about were all alive despite being filled with injuries, Ling Tian could finally heave a sigh of relief. But upon seeing the pathetic state of the Ling Family Courtyard and the corpses of his many soldiers, the rage in Ling Tian\u2019s heart began to burn again.</p><br/><p>In this lifetime, this was the first time Ling Tian suffered from such a huge loss! How could he not be frustrated?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smirked as his gaze swept the Lei Family members. At the same time, his inner qi was circulated all around his body so that he could recover his inner qi at the fastest possible time.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to kill his opponents effectively, he must first have sufficient strength!</p><br/><p>He then turned to look at Justice, \u201cYou are here.\u201d His calm tone and greeting were as though he was saying hello to an old friend. While Ling Tian\u2019s expression was unchanged, the feelings of these simple words were like the mountains!</p><br/><p>Justice could naturally understand what Ling Tian was thinking. With Justice\u2019s lonesome character, if Ling Tian were to thank him profusely right now, he would probably leave immediately with a flick of his sleeves. A favor should be remembered in the heart and it was useless to talk about it.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a need to say thanks! At their realm, it would be strange if they would still thank each other superficially. Thus, Justice did not find Ling Tian\u2019s attitude odd at all.</p><br/><p>Justice nodded his head and said calmly, \u201cYou came back pretty quickly\u2026 However, before you settle this matter, you have a debt that you owe me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled, \u201cI don\u2019t think I owe you anything, do I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice snorted coldly, \u201cYou are probably the only one who has the guts to feign ignorance in front of me. Do you want me to settle the debt with you right here and now?!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

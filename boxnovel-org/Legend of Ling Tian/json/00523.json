Crown Prince having feelings is perfectly normal, it proves that the Eastern Zhao Crown Prince is actually a perfectly normal person!\u201d Ling Tian still had that friendly smile on his face as he took a step forward. \u201cAs a man myself, I completely agree with Crown Prince\u2019s thoughts, and thus, I\u2019ll give you this chance for you to plunder a beauty. Come on, I\u2019m just a poor and weak scholar. So long as you can kill me, you can hug the beauty in your arms. No one will stop you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian kept his smile as he approached step by step, his gentle voice, expression and kind face now morphed into a pressuring force akin to a lofty mountain. It followed the rhythm of his footsteps, slowly crushing DongFang XingChen!</p><br/><p>DongFang XingChen seemed to have encountered a vicious spirit as he fearfully screamed, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 don\u2019t come any closer!\u201d However stupid he might be, he would also understand when Ling Tian exuded the pressure that he was no weak scholar without the strength to truss a chicken, but rather a peerless expert of the pugilistic world! He trembled as he commanded, \u201cYou\u2026 you dare to touch me? This prince is the Crown Prince of Eastern Zhao, the future monarch of a country! If you dare to touch a single hair of mine, you\u2019ll meet with the revenge of the entire country! You\u2026 stand still\u2026 for this prince!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sarcastically laughed out, \u201cOh, I\u2019m really scared\u2026 your identity has been revealed just now. If that was the case, would I still have been discussing with my wife just now?\u201d As he spoke, he suddenly did an exaggerated shiver, holding his arms together as he smiled at DongFang XingChen, \u201cCrown Prince of Eastern Zhao? Do you want to guess whether I dare to touch you? Hahaha\u2026 Crown Prince, what a noble identity!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a putong sound, DongFang XingChen finally became scared out of his wits. He felt his entire body bereft of strength as he slipped off from his horse. He immediately rolled and crawled towards the back, trying to find a safe place to hide\u2026</p><br/><p>DongFang Hen could only sigh in response. Previously, he did not make a move because he was hoping that this mysterious scholarly character would be restrained by the fact that they were in Eastern Zhao\u2019s territory, and that this was the Crown Prince of Eastern Zhao. After all, the pressure he exuded was not ordinary, and if there was no need to make enemies, he would rather they part on good terms.</p><br/><p>However, this scholarly looking guy had already made it clear that he was going to make a move towards DongFang XingChen. If he still did not move, then whatever happened, he would not be able to escape responsibility. Thus, he immediately put himself between the both of them, saying, \u201cSire, you\u2019re a cut above the rest, and since we\u2019ve already paid the lives of eight people, while your wife remains unharmed, is that not enough for you? Why not you just stop at this, and everyone part as friends. This would make life easier for all of us, and all of Eastern Zhao will owe you a favor. How does that sound?\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang Hen was naturally not very good at talking with people. However, the prowess that Ling Tian showed had caused a great fear within DongFang Hen, to the point that he realized he wasn\u2019t a match for the youth in front and had to soften his approach.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake friends? Damn old fart! Are you a f**king idiot?\u201d Ling Tian hooted in ridicule. \u201cYour Crown Prince over there wanted to snatch my wife and even silence me! Make friends? Damn old fart, if your wife was being stolen by someone, would you go and look for the perpetrator to make friends? How about I make friends with your mother?! If I didn\u2019t possess any martial arts, then would you even bring this topic up?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could not help but be incensed and start to scold unceasingly. He was not angry over DongFang XingChen\u2019s sexual urges, because so long as he was present, he would be able to thwart all attempts. He was angry over the fact that his plan had almost been foiled, thus he was angry, a depressed sort of anger!</p><br/><p>Being lashed out at, DongFang Hen was naturally not in a good mood and angrily replied, \u201cYoungster, this old man is saying this for you own good! My house\u2019s Crown Prince might not be the best example, but he is in the end the Eastern Zhao Crown Prince! With just the strength of one person, how can you resist? Can you resist the force behind a whole country? You really do not know what\u2019s good for you! This old man is advising you, but you\u2019re looking for death instead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei!\u201d Ling Tian spat in disdain, followed by another round of scolding, \u201cEastern Zhao\u2019s Crown Prince? What sh*t does that count for? Old cuckold, why don\u2019t you scram to the side for this daddy right now! Daddy here doesn\u2019t want to kill you, and thus similarly, you should be more obedient! Scram! If you still continue to make this daddy unhappy, I\u2019ll make short work of you first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have my own duties. I\u2019m sorry for offending, but this DongFang Hen from the DongFang Aristocratic family will seek advice!\u201d Having been called an old b*st*rd, then an old cuckold, however good DongFang Hen\u2019s temper was, it had already reached the limit. He slowly drew his sword as he solemnly spoke.</p><br/><p>Even though he spoke thus, DongFang Hen knew that if the opponent did not even put the Imperial Family in his eyes, there was no way he would do the same for the DongFang Family. He was only grabbing straws, trying to see if his own history and backing would cause some fear in his opponent.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuty? Is your duty to help your master snatch other people\u2019s women? Offending? You tell me how offended you would be if I tried to steal your wife! But even that isn\u2019t the same as I\u2019m not interested in your wife at all!\u201d Ling Tian laughed out sarcastically. \u201cAs for the DongFang aristocratic family? Hahaha, that DongFang Family! What a joke\u2026 you had better go back quickly for the funeral, instead of tangling with me over here. What a joke!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFuneral?\u201d A bad feeling rose inside DongFang Hen\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ll naturally know once you return. I don\u2019t have any interest to speaking rubbish to you anymore. Since you\u2019re not willing to move aside, then let me help you with that!\u201d Ling Tian darkly smiled, and his figure flashed. DongFang Hen loudly shouted and his sword thrust straight forward, but found out that he was suddenly surrounded by eight Ling Tians all around him. Every single image was distinct and real, even to that cruel smile on their faces. All of them had their palms outstretched, ready to blast him away!</p><br/><p>DongFang Hen lost all color in his face. He knew that this was because of the rapid movement of this peak level expert that had left behind the various afterimages, thus he immediately thought of retreating. He knew that this skill of his opponent wasn\u2019t something he could break at his level. However, just as the thought occurred, three dull thuds were heard as his body received three palm strikes in a row. He rolled away like a calabash upon falling on the ground, vomiting copious amounts of blood as he did\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian said he would make him scram, and it turned out that DongFang Hen was really made to \u2018roll\u2019 1 away. While his injuries were serious, they were not life threatening. Ling Tian was being merciful this time, because there was some use to his life!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t come over\u2026 Ah~~~\u201d DongFang XingChen let out a pitiful scream, as he was kicked down on the ground by Ling Tian the moment he managed to get to his feet. Ling Tian\u2019s face hung a devilish like smile, as he applied some force and tore DongFang XingChen\u2019s robe off, while he grinned, \u201cYour Highness Crown Prince, today, this daddy will let you feel really good! Your luck can be considered good, for this daddy here will leave you with your life! I\u2019ll leave your life behind, and I won\u2019t go back on my promise!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that Ling Tian would not kill him, DongFang XingChen became more relaxed. However, he suddenly felt a breeze brushing across his body, and realized that he was completely nude in the open. Behind him, Xiao YanXue let out a squeal, and closed her eyes as she scolded, \u201cDamn pervert, smelly hooligan, who asked you to do this\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was depressed as he thought to himself, If I don\u2019t strip him, how am I going to perform the operation? Wasn\u2019t that your commands, Miss? Why am I being scolded as a pervert even though I\u2019ve done as you asked?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 what do you want to do?\u201d DongFang XingChen used his hands to cover his important parts, suddenly feeling as though something was wrong. Could it be that this expert had some homosexual fetish, and suddenly fell for him? If not, why would he strip him of his clothes?!</p><br/><p>If Ling Tian knew his thoughts, most likely he would have slapped down straight!</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh! Such a toothpick-like small object, yet you\u2019re protecting it like some treasure. It should have been removed a long time ago, to save you on the embarrassment.\u201d Ling Tian looked down, wrinkling his nose in distaste. \u201cI\u2019ll do you a favor today, and please remember not to bring it out the next time to embarrass yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before DongFang XingChen could show any reaction, Ling Tian\u2019s hands had flashed, and small and exquisite dagger had appeared in his palm, unhesitatingly slashing down.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2014\u2014Ah\u2014\u2014\u201d DongFang XingChen\u2019s screams could be heard echoing throughout the entire area, his mournful screams reaching the maximum. Below his thighs, blood had already formed a pool, starting to spread out. A pair of tiny egg-shaped things was thrown off from the edge of Ling Tian\u2019s dagger. Thinking for a while, Ling Tian decided that he did not have enough fun and poked his dagger again, removing another portion\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it just a small operation? Look at you, screaming and wriggling so intensely. Be calm! You need to endure, you know that?\u201d Ling Tian cast a look of disdain, as he wiped his dagger on several places all over his body, in the process creating over ten different trails of blood\u2026 before he finally put away his dagger.</p><br/><p>It looks like, other than running in the nude, our Crown Prince had no other way to go back to the city\u2026.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian slowly straightened his back, speaking in a stately voice, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you are inside the palace, or else it would be difficult for you in the future. Talk to the workers in the palace more often, on how to relieve yourself and so on. It will definitely be different from the past.\u201d DongFang XingChen already had a forehead full of sweat, without even the strength to call out\u2026 however, Ling Tian had infused a small amount of energy to him, such that he remained clear headed without the ability to faint even if he wanted\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing their master get castrated and turned into a eunuch in front of them, all the guards started to sweat profusely. Over a hundred pairs of legs started shaking at once, as though someone was using their legs to play the lute\u2026 they knew that once this matter was reported, it would spell their deaths, but none present dared to lift a finger to deal with this frightening scholar\u2026</p><br/><p>A few of the more frightened ones even lost control of themselves, and started to wet their pants. Sounds of trickling water could be heard\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian heartily laughed out, floating up without looking back and landing on his own horseback, as he shouted out, \u201cDelightful! Truly delightful! This is the outcome for those who want to steal the wives of others!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

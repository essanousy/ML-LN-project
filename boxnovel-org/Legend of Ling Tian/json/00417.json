How would that be something easy? No one was clear about Ling Tian\u2019s current aptitude, but just his performance in moving unhindered within 400,000 enemy troops and killing at will was already enough to tell them that at most 30% of them might survive after this trip, with the least being less than 10%!</p><br/><p>This task was simply a suicide mission! Everyone was on high alert, warily observing their surroundings. Any form of movement, even that of the wind rustling the grass, would be met with an uproar.</p><br/><p>This was really being panicked at the slightest movement, ready to treat everyone as an enemy!</p><br/><p>During this high-pressure scenario, a light blue figure suddenly appeared. However, her presence also heralded a bombardment of attacks like thunder in a thunderstorm. Shrouded in the mysterious and strange energies, the men felt as though their bodies had sunk into an icy cold hell. However, under their long preparation, all of them immediately stood up and surged forwards like a tsunami.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the sound of a bugle broke the silence!</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian is here! Ling Tian has come!!\u201d A voice that sounded like it was crying sounded, and it could be inferred that the person was probably crying about there being no tomorrow\u2026</p><br/><p>The name Ling Tian was like a death god\u2019s name that had imprinted itself on the hearts of every single one of the DongFang guards! This was something that they couldn\u2019t mask their fear about!</p><br/><p>The guards rushed crazily from all directions towards the blue colored figure.</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s illusory figure drifted around the battlefield, not unlike a specter, weaving in and out of the human crowds, seemingly calm and unruffled!</p><br/><p>With a light wave of her palm, two guards in front of her were covered in frost, already unable to move. However, Li Xue did not stop just from this, she borrowed the repulsion force to soar backward, once again knocking out another two, then bouncing off to another direction. Just like that, she appeared within another crowd\u2026</p><br/><p>What an exquisite movement technique! What mystical body movements!</p><br/><p>Even if it was Ling Tian himself, it was unlikely that he could do better!</p><br/><p>She rebounded all over the place, in a ceaseless cycle, without even stopping for a moment. The DongFang Family had a lot of experts, but meeting someone with such an extreme speed as her, they had no way to effectively surround and attack her, which resulted in a complete and disastrous loss!</p><br/><p>However, after the initial chaos, someone shouted out loudly, \u201cEveryone, take three steps back, and ensure that you do not stand together with someone. Swords face front, no need to panic!\u201d Under the leadership of this voice, the guards of the DongFang family suddenly rallied and formed a hollow circle. On the outside, there were more and more guards surging over.</p><br/><p>Li Xue was originally here to create chaos, and as such, the more chaotic it was, the better for her, as this would allow Ling Tian to benefit and gain more time. She also believed that, even if she were to be completely surrounded, she would still have the ability to escape from any encirclement, thus she did not make a fuss at all, allowing them to surround her completely.</p><br/><p>At this point, everyone could clearly see that the intruder was no Ling Tian, but rather a lady, and an extremely strong one at that! Seeing that it was not the death god himself that had come, everyone felt more at ease. Seeing that she was completely surrounded gave them more confidence that she would be unable to escape even with her strong martial skills! Everyone felt their spirits being lifted, and a few of the more vulgar ones even began to lasciviously speak, \u201cWhere has this slut come from? To dare to make a mess in this grandfather\u2019s place! Little slut, are you here to find a strong man! Do you have a need, hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeat this slut to death! Trying to scare all of these daddies here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, quickly capture her, and tear down that veil of hers! Look at her body, if everyone works hard, we\u2019ll have some happy times tonight!\u201d The voice sounded like one of their leaders.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral Xia, let\u2019s not take down the veil. Her face is probably full of pimples, that\u2019s why she\u2019s covering it up. If we were to see it, then all the brothers here will be too disgusted to do anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone started to laugh and hoot, \u201cMakes sense, a covered face adds to more excitement, hahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s face turned frosty and she immediately accelerated. With a \u2018pa\u2019 sound, the last person who was hooting ate a vicious slap to his face, and under the force, he actually spun a whole 360 degrees before landing on the ground in a daze. His mouth gaped, and numerous teeth actually fell out! His head continued to spin where he fell, an indicator of the force used.</p><br/><p>Being offended by this vulgar man\u2019s words, Li Xue\u2019s slap was no doubt vicious and loud. It could be considered a miracle she did not take his life! With her identity of the past and present, if she was not accommodating Ling Tian this time, just this sentence would probably make her pile up corpses into a mountain!</p><br/><p>This loud and crisp slap sent a shock to all of the DongFang guards present. All of them simultaneously realized that what they were facing was not a young and weak lass, but rather an unfathomable female expert. Immediately, the laughs and verbal abuse halted, as though a knife had sliced through all noise!</p><br/><p>A killing intent shot forth from Li Xue\u2019s eyes as she looked at the men surrounding her slowly. At this point, two men walked out from the encirclement. The moment Li Xue saw them, even with a bosom full of rage, she almost burst out into laughter.</p><br/><p>The two of them were twins and completely identical ones at that! Both of them had repulsive faces; the same broomstick brows, slanted eyes, and upturned noses. Then there was that huge hippopotamus-esque mouth of theirs, the same pockmarked faces, and weird goatees that looked like a messy chicken\u2019s nest! The part that made Li Xue want to laugh the most was not their similar features, but rather the fact that both of them had the same huge, ugly red boil in the middle of their brows!</p><br/><p>In contrast, their bearings were elegant like a scholar, their mannerisms polite as they seriously cupped their fists in front of Li Xue, speaking the same words.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person is He ChuLai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person is He ChuQu.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know the honored name of this miss, and your purpose of coming here today?\u201d</p><br/><p>The first two sentences were said separately by both brothers, but the third was spoken at the exact same time. From the opening to the closing of their mouths they were perfectly in sync. Even the tone used by them as well as their voices sounded similar, to the point that if one did not look at them speaking, they would have thought that only one of them was speaking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue stared with her mouth agape at this scenario, then suddenly bent her waist and burst out into laughter.</p><br/><p>The disturbance from the fight naturally was heard by DongFang JingLei, but they only exchanged a look before remaining where they were.</p><br/><p>Because if it was Ling Tian himself, the disturbance would not be limited to this. If the person was not Ling Tian, then with a thousand experts outside, if they could not solve such a small problem then they all could just use a piece of tofu to commit suicide!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, there were the twin experts who were holding the fort outside!</p><br/><p>Thus, the two of them felt extremely assured!</p><br/><p>As such, they only listened to the noises and chaos outside, which made them even more relieved. As it turns out, it was a lady! They became even more relaxed.</p><br/><p>However, the two of them were unaware that the lady outside, while she might not triumph over Ling Tian, was likely on the same level. If she really were to put in her all to annoy the DongFang Family, then even with DongFang JingLei and DongFang HuaHu participating, they would probably still be unable to pin her down! Just relying on the people outside would be completely useless.</p><br/><p>DongFang HuaHu laughed out, taking joy in the unknown lady\u2019s misfortune as he spoke, \u201cThese few days, He ChuLai and ChuQu have also been complaining that they have nothing to do and that they were about to be bored to death. My ears have been ringing non-stop from their voices, and now, at least they have some exercise to work themselves on.\u201d</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei laughed along, \u201cJust a lass, I\u2019m afraid they might not even get the chance to properly work their muscles.\u201d</p><br/><p>HuaHu smirked in reply, \u201cWho knows, maybe they might have to fight among themselves to decide who would be the first to face off, hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The thought made JingLei smile, \u201cWhat an interesting pair, bringing them out really helps to relieve quite a bit of boredom.\u201d Little did the two of them know that the twins He ChuLai and He ChuQu were not even interested in competing among themselves. Facing this blue-robed lady, they felt as though their hearts were about to freeze over, their bodies almost being encased in ice. Both of them were actually sweating non-stop at this moment!</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Master DongFang, we haven\u2019t seen each other after bidding goodbye a few months before. How are you right now?\u201d A carefully articulated and gleeful voice suddenly sounded from the outside. If anyone heard it, they would only think that the speaker was in an incomparably good mood, to the point that he was grinning from ear to ear.</p><br/><p>However, DongFang JingLei\u2019s face took on a change, immediately beginning to put out a cold sweat. Completely contrary to the person\u2019s mood outside, DongFang JingLei only felt endless fear, as though he had suddenly sunk into a nightmare. As for his mood, let\u2019s not even mention it!</p><br/><p>Him bringing all his men from afar was just to hunt down this person speaking right now. However, upon hearing his voice now, JingLei concluded that he\u2019d rather not have heard this at all! This demonic character, why wasn\u2019t he going over to tangle with the Martial Order Medallion owner, but rather running over to pester him! With the Yu, Xiao, and XiMen Families, so many of them present, why him?!!</p><br/><p>DongFang JingLei suddenly felt an extreme hatred for Justice as he thought, What sort of sh*t are you eating as the Martial Order Medallion owner, Justice?! To think that you can allow your target to sashay into my camp like that, are you not even pressuring him?!!!</p><br/><p>Seeing DongFang JingLei turn pale upon hearing the voice, DongFang HuaHu could not help but feel a little uneasy, and whispered, \u201cWho is the person? Is he an enemy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian!\u201d DongFang JingLei\u2019s eyes were riveted straight ahead, staring at the entrance of the tent. He did not know if he was answering HuaHu, or greeting the person who had just walked in. All he felt was an endless fear!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even if I know that what I am doing isn\u2019t right, I am unable to throw away the decades of brotherly ties I had. While it isn\u2019t a righteous decision, my feelings compel me to do so. I will not let big brother face your millions of soldiers and numerous experts alone!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause he is my big brother forever! Because I will always be a member of the Yu Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps you may think that I am foolish or unable to see through right from wrong. However, now that BingYan has someone to spend the rest of her life with, I do not have any more burdens in my heart. Thus, even if this decision of mine is wrong and it would be against my conscience, I can make this decision without any hesitation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith BingYan in your hands, everything that my brother wanted her to do is in the past. Regardless of how my big brother erred, perhaps he made the wrong choice or had the wrong thoughts, in my heart, he is doing everything for the Yu Family! This is something that I have no doubts about!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang chuckled and he turned around with his eyes glowing, \u201cThe gentleman is Ling Tian, my good son-in-law, please take good care of my daughter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive her happiness!\u201d When these few words sounded, Yu ManTang\u2019s figure had already disappeared from Ling Tian\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian took two steps back and sat back on his chair with Yu ManTang\u2019s words echoing in his ears.</p><br/><p>Figures flashed and Ling Jian and Ling Chi appeared by the door with a look of deep thought on their faces. Obviously, they had both heard what Yu ManTang said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes young noble think that Second Master Yu\u2019s words are difficult to understand?\u201d Ling Chi asked.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shook his head bitterly without saying a thing. He was naturally able to understand what Yu ManTang was saying, but despite that, he still felt as though his entire head was in a complete mess.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian smiled and said, \u201cIn truth, Second Master Yu\u2019s words are easy to understand. Second Master Yu\u2019s actions are one of a sentimental individual. Just like how us brothers will always follow young noble. Regardless of what young noble does, we will always support you. Even if your actions go against the heavens, cause the destruction of nations, go against the entire world, or even incite the rage of the heavens and earth. We all have a moral compass in our hearts and can tell right from wrong. However, as long as young noble makes the decision, regardless of the mistake, we will follow young noble to the very end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf young noble chooses to be a benevolent individual, we will be a living Buddha. If young noble chooses to be a vile individual, we will be your slaughter blade! This has nothing to do with right and wrong. The key is young noble\u2019s choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of us are living for young noble and everything we do in this world will be for young noble. Thus, it is impossible to talk about good and evil. If there isn\u2019t young noble in this world, so what if we become living deities or unparalleled heroes in the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe this is how Second Master Yu feels about Yu ManLou as well!\u2019 Ling Jian chuckled, \u201cThe feelings of us brothers towards young noble will only exceed that of Yu ManTang\u2019s feelings towards Yu ManLou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chi nodded his head in agreement, \u201cWhat brother Jian said is also what I wanted to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s mind cleared up immediately as though he was enlightened.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, this is indeed the case!</p><br/><p>Foolish loyalty!</p><br/><p>It can be said that this is the manifestation of an individual\u2019s charisma.</p><br/><p>Everyone understood what was justice and righteousness. The line between good and evil was also something that everyone was clear on. It is also because of such stubbornness that the human world was filled with so much excitement. It is also because of this that there would be countless heroic legends!</p><br/><p>A warrior will die for one who understands him!</p><br/><p>This was probably the case!</p><br/><p>The one who understands him may not be a benevolent or righteous individual!</p><br/><p>However, there may still be many who will be willing to sacrifice their lives for him.</p><br/><p>Just like in the history books, when General Yue Fei of the Southern Song dynasty died, there were many generals under his charge who committed suicide upon hearing the news. This was probably the reason!</p><br/><p>Who didn\u2019t understand the importance of life? Who wouldn\u2019t be able to tell right from wrong? It was a road of no turning back the moment they stepped on it!</p><br/><p>However, they still chose to do so!</p><br/><p>They were foolishly respected, foolishly cute, and their foolishness could be praised!</p><br/><p>Slapping Ling Jian and Ling Chi on the shoulders, Ling Tian walked out without saying a word. His originally heavy footsteps also became strangely light at this instant.</p><br/><p>After the solemn conversation with his father-in-law, Ling Tian had almost forgotten that today was the day of his wedding! He still had six beauties waiting for him. While the banquet in the palace had already been finished, the entire palace was still bustling with excitement.</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian walked into the palace, many eunuchs and maids would greet him along the way.</p><br/><p>The eastern palace was up ahead and it was the palace of the empress, the place where Ling Chen was staying!</p><br/><p>After asking, Ling Tian was shocked to realize that the palaces of the ladies were in all four directions. Upon hearing that, Ling Tian could not help but feel a tinge of rage. Why do they have to be so far apart? Could it be that I have to run all the way from the east to the west in the middle of the night? This is too much! How can a single person be able to satisfy this Emperor?!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian thought as he walked and his footsteps suddenly paused, \u201cFind someone to expand my bedroom tomorrow. Mmm, let the head butler find me with his proposal.\u201d</p><br/><p>A eunuch by his side hurriedly knelt down and accepted the decree. Ling Tian immediately felt a wave of depression. It truly wasn\u2019t easy to be an emperor. Wherever he walked, he would be accompanied by a bunch of kowtowing bugs. It was truly too annoying. No wonder his grandfather and father hated the idea of being emperor. They were truly the most intelligent ones. It seems like I must hurry up and make a little Ling Tian so that I can get rid of all these darn rules.</p><br/><p>After finally making his way to Ling Chen\u2019s eastern palace, Ling Chen welcomed him in with her face completely reddened. After a short two sentences, she then resolutely chased him out of her palace. As the Empress, she could not possibly have Ling Tian to herself on their wedding day. After all, Ling Tian still had to pay a visit to her other sisters and do what he had to.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian rubbed his nose and could only back out of the palace helplessly. With Ling Chen sending him out with a bright smile on her face, Ling Tian had no choice but to change his route. As the slightly depressed Ling Tian thought about Li Xue\u2019s proud and cold beauty, he felt his heart ablaze. It doesn\u2019t seem like a bad idea to subdue this demoness first as well. Since you always like to tease this young noble, this young noble shall show you what it means to roam unhindered with a single spear. As he fantasized what was about to come, Ling Tian could not help but let out two strange chuckles. Imagining the look of Li Xue pleading under him, Ling Tian could not help but grow eager.</p><br/><p>When he arrived at the door of the Imperial Consort, Ling Tian was thoroughly stunned.</p><br/><p>He was actually greeted with a shut door!</p><br/><p>The monarch of an empire was greeted with a shut door!</p><br/><p>The two palace maids were trembling as they knelt on the ground, reporting to Ling Tian that the Imperial Consort was tired and had fallen asleep!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian became incensed. Isn\u2019t this the palace? I am the current Emperor and the ruler of this land! Is there still a place that I cannot go to in the palace? How ridiculous! Ling Tian raised up the hem of his robes and was about to barge in.</p><br/><p>The two palace maids hurriedly kowtowed profusely in fear but actually refused to move out of the way. At the same time, they cried out to Ling Tian to give the decree to execute them if he really wanted to meet the Imperial Consort. Upon asking, Ling Tian realized that the Imperial Consort had given a strict order for them to just commit suicide if they allowed the Emperor to enter\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian halted his footsteps angrily as he puffed angrily. He couldn\u2019t possibly execute two palace maids just because of such a small matter after all! Letting out a snort, he turned around to walk towards Yu BingYan\u2019s palace. Yu BingYan has always been a gentle lady and she should not reject me outside of the door, right?</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan lived up to Ling Tian\u2019s expectations indeed and did not reject Ling Tian outside of the door. After welcoming him warmly into the palace, she then told Ling Tian with a strangely resolute tone: There are still many younger sisters who are waiting for Your Majesty tonight. In any case, she was implying that Ling Tian couldn\u2019t spend the night there!</p><br/><p>Before Ling Tian could even warm his seat and finish a cup of tea, he was sent out by Yu BingYan respectfully.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was furious.</p><br/><p>With Ling Tian\u2019s unparalleled movement techniques, he was naturally able to endure the running around. However, the pitiful ones were the eunuchs following behind Ling Tian. They had run around to the point their legs were almost broken and were all panting heavily. After all, not everyone was a peerless expert.</p><br/><p>After a short while, Ling Tian arrived at Xiao YanXue\u2019s place. Xiao YanXue naturally welcomed him respectfully but had also resolutely and politely invited Ling Tian to the palace of her other sisters!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>However, he refused to give up and went to find Shui QianRou. In the end, his treatment and the reason she gave was the same\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, even Ling Tian began to feel tired with his unparalleled movement techniques. He barged into princess JiaoYue\u2019s room and refused to leave.</p><br/><p>But in the end, Ling Tian was still chased out with a helpless look on his face.</p><br/><p>It was for no other reason but because princess JiaoYue had taken out the biggest weapon a woman could have: tears!</p><br/><p>This weapon was one that Ling Tian was most afraid of. Seeing the tears of his cousin fall flow down from her cheeks, all of Ling Tian\u2019s fantasies were immediately thrown out his mind. Even his energetic little Ling Tian had lost all of its energy and Ling Tian could only walk away in defeat.</p><br/><p>Dejected and depressed, Ling Tian took a stroll in the imperial garden as he let out a long sigh. Turning around and looking at the eunuch Xiao De\u2019Zi who was panting to the point his tongue was sticking out, Ling Tian asked, \u201cXiao De\u2019Zi, have you ever seen an emperor with such bad luck? I married six beauties in a single day but cannot find a place to sleep on my wedding night!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao De\u2019Zi panted heavily with sweat all over his face and he did not dare to say a single word. At the same time, he truly did not have the strength to say anything either. In this short span of time, they had run around the entire palace and with even Ling Tian feeling tired, Xiao De\u2019Zi who did not have any martial arts was naturally exhausted.</p><br/><p>Feeling bored, Ling Tian sat down on a stone table under a tree and said, \u201cGo back and rest, don\u2019t bother about me.\u201d He then chased all of the eunuchs by his side away and sat down with a sigh.</p><br/><p>Having no place to sleep on his wedding night, this was truly a queer sight. Was this the logic of a single monk will scoop water from the well but many monks has no water to drink?!</p><br/><p>If all of you push this daddy to the limits, I shall go and find a prostitute! Ling Tian thought hatefully. Just when he was in thought, he suddenly felt a strange fluctuation in the air which indicated the appearance of experts in the palace.</p></div>\n</div>"}

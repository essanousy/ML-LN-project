Because there was no shame in him losing! Know yourself and know thy enemy, only then can you emerge victorious! In the battle just now, it was his opponent that had understood him completely, even his temper and innate disposition, to the point where he could predict every single reaction he would make based on that. However, he was absolutely clueless about his opponent! Thus when his opponent had already come knocking, he still arrogantly chose to underestimate him!</p><br/><p>With deep thoughts and meticulous planning, coupled with an arrogant opponent who had let down his guard, if one still could not win, that would be the biggest joke on earth!</p><br/><p>A strip of black shadow noiselessly appeared behind Xiao FengHan at this time. Xiao FengHan did not turn back, but rather, let out a bitter laugh, \u201cThe matters just now, you saw them all, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black shadow was a skinny middle-aged man. Upon hearing Xiao FengHan speak, he merely nodded his head slightly, refraining from talking.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan laughed mockingly at himself, \u201cDo you find me laughable?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a serious expression, the black shadow replied, \u201cThis child, no matter his wisdom or shrewdness, all are beyond ordinary. He is definitely a rare genius.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan could only sigh, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s right, this old man feels this way as well. Today\u2019s annulling of the marriage could be said to be a mistake of epic proportions. If we had been able to nurture this sort of person into an adult, then he could bring us assistance of unimaginable proportions! Ai, what a pity!\u201d</p><br/><p>The black shadow, however, muttered to himself irresolutely for a while before unhurriedly replying, \u201cI don\u2019t see it this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan let out a cry of surprise, \u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The black shadow continued, \u201cFrom the surface, Family Head, you have utterly lost! However, if we were to observe from a bigger point of view, it is indeed a cause to rejoice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan seemed to have grasped hold of something, saying, \u201cElaborate more.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black shadow said, \u201cFrom the immediate point, annulling the marriage and losing a genius; even being extorted and losing the military workshop and throwing a wrench in all our plans, it seems to be a thorough disaster. However, even though this plan was a failure, if we were to look at the long term effects, we have just avoided a danger that could potentially result in the Xiao family being annihilated!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan muttered to himself, \u201cAnnihilated\u2026 annihilated\u2026\u201d His eyes suddenly lit up!</p><br/><p>The black shadow unceasingly continued, \u201cFor someone like him who is head and shoulders above all others since childhood, showing extraordinary talent, his actions would definitely be firm and ruthless without hesitation. How could such a person be willing to be shackled down, living under someone\u2019s rule? If the marriage problem remains unsolved, then if a problem were to occur, the Ling family would definitely stand with our family, and this sort of person would definitely become the nucleus of our great army. After a long while, given the intellect and stratagems of such a person, hahaha\u2026\u201d The black shadow did not continue after saying this point, only using his laughter to complete the sentence.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengHan\u2019s eyes lit up at this, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s right! Hahaha, in the end he\u2019s still a kid and his thinking is not mature enough; if he continues to endure silently, not purposely showing off his silkpants side, then the marriage will proceed as per normal. When he grows up and marries Xue\u2019er, then he could use the entire Xiao family to open up a new rule under him\u2026 hahaha, how dangerous! How dangerous!\u201d Though his mouth was saying how dangerous it could have been, his facial expression revealed he was actually happily laughing without any worries.</p><br/><p>It was a mere two years of effort, but in the process, he had inadvertently gotten rid of a cancerous tumor! Xiao FengHan exchanged a look with the black shadow, both letting out a smile, their hearts shouting in celebration. Even losing the military workshop which served as a base of operations suddenly felt as though it was worth it.</p><br/><p>For quite a while, the black shadow\u2019s concentration was placed towards the direction in which Ling Tian had left. His heart was filled with suspicion: Was that smile that he gave as he left directed at me? Though that smile was gentle and felt like a spring breeze, from the black shadow\u2019s point of view, it looked like a flash of lightning, piercing through his defences at the least he expected it. That smile was obviously\u2026 a warning! A severe warning! Don\u2019t tell me, he can really sense me? In this world, outside of my sect, are there really still people who have mastered such mystical skills? The black shadow was filled with doubts.</p><br/><p>Due to him not being able to confirm if Ling Tian had really spotted himself, moreover, deep in his heart, he felt that it was impossible for a mere five-year-old child to actually see through his disguise. Arrogance long ingrained within made him push this matter to the back after a brief moment of suspicion and doubt.</p><br/><p>In reality, in this world, the black shadow felt that things that were capable of letting him place within his heart were but few. As such, he did not mention this matter to Xiao FengHan. However, little did he know that his arrogance today would lead to his own sect literally being extinguished!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s mood was joyous. With this sort of capital in his hands, he could finally be able to attack, albeit with difficulty. Today\u2019s events went like a rehearsed play, completely according to how he had expected it to be as though he had arranged it methodically. The ending was perfect beyond his expectations. Not only did Ling Tian get what he wanted, but also an unexpected bounty. And that was that Madam Ling had also joined Ling Tian\u2019s faction. With his grandmother\u2019s support, this gave Ling Tian the confidence to carry out the next step of his plan.</p><br/><p>Mister Qin was by his side, and from start to end, he silently watched the whole process without talking once. From the time Ling Tian walked into the room, his arrogant and disrespectful attitude successfully roused the hate of Xiao FengHan, followed by his effortless control of the entire conversation, knowing when to press and when to relax. All of this inexorably led Xiao FengHan to an unrecoverable trap, finally succeeding.</p><br/><p>The whole process went like moving clouds and flowing water, with Ling Tian firmly holding onto Xiao FengHan, playing this ruthless character around the palm of his hand. This sort of feeling was difficult to describe. Mister Qin found out that Ling Tian\u2019s intellect was more and more akin to the vast ocean; no wonder he was the chosen one sent from heaven! This caused Mister Qin\u2019s eyes to shine with a pious light.</p><br/><p>The most ingenious method from Ling Tian would be the fact that he separated himself from the Ling family step by step; this was incredibly funny. Ling Tian rode on the name of the Ling family, using their status to negotiate with Xiao FengHan. But in the end, Xiao FengHan was reduced to the point that he did not even have the right to look for trouble with the Ling family\u2026 Once Xiao FengHan realized this point, he would definitely be overcome with depression!</p><br/><p>Seeing that Mister Qin was silent throughout, Ling Tian curiously asked, \u201cMister, what are you thinking that makes you so entranced?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mister Qin let out a full breath of admiration and was just about to speak before he remembered a point, \u201cTian\u2019er, if you do it like this, this will result in a huge blow to the relations between both families! In the end, you\u2019re still Duke Ling\u2019s grandson. If Xiao FengHan goes to look for your grandfather to condemn him and explains this matter, I\u2019m afraid we will not know how Duke Ling will react.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled in a relaxed way, \u201cMister is overthinking. I dare to guarantee that for this matter, Xiao FengHan will not be able to announce it and can only let it rot in his guts!\u201d</p><br/><p>In confusion, Mister Qin asked, \u201cWhy is that so? Such a huge loss, and with you, the Ling family would rise to the pinnacle. How could he swallow such a matter so easily?\u201d</p>\n</div>"}

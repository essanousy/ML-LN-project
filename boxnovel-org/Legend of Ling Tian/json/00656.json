It would be best to consider it a draw.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian\u2019s boorish voice also sounded, \u201cIt is obviously a draw, what is the point of discussing this matter? Are all of you guys blind!\u201d</p><br/><p>The judges of Beyond Heavens and Outside Heavens stared at each other with odd looks on their faces.</p><br/><p>How strange!</p><br/><p>The moment the Shui Family Head made such a suggestion, the two brothers from the Yu Family agreed without any hesitation. On the other hand, the two brothers from the Shui Family refused to agree with the suggestion. Just what is going on?</p><br/><p>The otherworldly experts lamented together, They are truly thousand-year-old aristocratic families. The intricacies within this type of family are truly such a headache.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian who was already extremely worried about his niece\u2019s safety jumped out furiously and cursed at Shui ManPing and Shui ManShu, \u201cWhat are the two of you b*st*rds considered? Your boss already came out to say that the battle is a draw. Where did the two of you tortoises come out from? The two of you still dare to say that the fight isn\u2019t a draw? What rights do the two of you have to interrupt? Come come come, let this Third Master teach you what it means to respect your elders!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he cursed, Third Master Yu flicked his sleeves and charged forward like a peasant worker.</p><br/><p>Shui ManShu and Shui ManPing were thoroughly enraged. With their old enmity and new hatred added together, the two of them charged out together!</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough! Stop embarrassing yourself!\u201d Yu ManLou roared, \u201cRegardless of whether it should be a draw or whether they should continue fighting, the judges will make the decision. What are all of you arguing for? Stop making a fool of yourselves! Do any of you still have the appearance of a thousand-year-old aristocratic family?!\u201d His words were extremely jarring. Not only did he criticize Yu ManTian, he had even scolded both Shui ManShu and Shui ManPing!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong looked at Yu ManLou with an odd expression. Hearing those words, it was obvious that Yu ManLou wanted the two ladies to continue fighting each other. No matter what, Yu BingYan is still your biological niece, aren\u2019t you afraid of her life or death?</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan had been plagued with illness since a young age and it was already a miracle for her to achieve a draw. If the two ladies were allowed to recover their inner qi, the first to recover would definitely be Shui QianRou without a doubt! Under such circumstances, the first one to make a move would definitely be the victor!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong naturally did not know that Yu ManLou indeed had such intentions!</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen truly understood what Yu BingYan meant to Ling Tian and also understood Yu ManLou\u2019s intentions. However, he would never allow things to go according to Yu ManLou\u2019s intentions. He knew that if he took the initiative to proclaim the fight a draw, the eagle-nosed elder would intentionally go against him and insist on the two ladies to fight. Thus, Ye QingChen chose to remain silent and glanced at the eagle-nosed elder.</p><br/><p>The eagle-nosed elder was extremely delighted in his heart and was certain that Ye QingChen did not notice any oddity. However, since the eagle-nosed elder was from Heavenly Wind, he would naturally stand on the side of the Shui Family. As for the plans of the Yu Family, why would he have to care about them?</p><br/><p>Coming to a decision in his heart, his stern voice sounded with fairness in his voice, \u201cBoth parties no longer have the strength to continue the battle. The battle shall end in a draw!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice of authority! Such a feeling truly felt good!</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen immediately echoed, \u201cThat\u2019s right, this battle should be treated as a draw!\u201d At the same time, he inwardly laughed with delight.</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong and Yu ManTang walked into the battlefield together to support their own daughters. Standing up together, they looked at each other with a sincere and friendly smile before supporting their daughters down.</p><br/><p>In a corner where no one noticed, Shui QianRou blinked her eyes with wisdom and Yu BingYan winked mischievously. The two of them were extremely satisfied with the performance that they had just put on.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian frowned as he thought to himself: The acting skills of these two ladies truly deserve the Oscars award. However, they truly exhausted all of their strength and if any accident were to happen, how would they protect themselves? With a flick of his fingers, a pill landed in Ling Feng\u2019s palms. Ling Feng immediately understood Ling Tian\u2019s intentions and walked forward to feed the pill to Yu BingYan. By the side, Shui QianRou also had someone to care for her and she consumed a snow white pill. If these two pills were placed beside each other, it would be extremely obvious that these two pills were completely identical!</p><br/><p>The Shui Family. Shui WuBo stood up emotionlessly and he looked at Yu ManLou, \u201cSince this battle is going to end in a draw, Family Head Yu, only the battle between us is left. WuBo has been looking forward to this battle for more than ten years! I hope that Family Head Yu will not be stingy with your teachings! Please do not let Shui WuBo down.\u201d</p><br/><p>While Shui WuBo was of a senior generation, Yu ManLou was the Family Head of the Yu Family. Although Shui WuBo was a martial idiot, he would treat those with strength with sufficient respect!</p><br/><p>Despite Shui WuBo standing there calmly without doing anything, the spectators felt as though there was a gigantic mountain erected in the plaza; a mountain made completely of sword qi!</p><br/><p>He was clad in black robes all over with his sharp battle intent overflowing! The atmosphere around him was visibly trembling as though he was a bloodthirsty sword yearning to drink the blood of the enemy!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s eyes lit up and he turned around to say, \u201cAh\u2019Jian, look carefully. What Shui WuBo has is something that you are currently lacking the most! This is truly a good opportunity and there will only be a single chance. You must watch this battle closely! This battle will allow your swordplay to attain newer heights!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s attention was already fixed on Shui WuBo and a powerful glow could be seen in his eyes. Hearing Ling Tian\u2019s words, he asked, \u201cOnly a single chance? Why? Could it be that Shui WuBo does not have any chance of emerging victorious and will not be able to retreat with his life?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a sigh and replied, \u201cWhile Shui WuBo\u2019s aura is majestic, his strength can be determined with our vision. However, Yu ManLou\u2019s cultivation is already like the depths of the ocean and is truly profound. While the two of their strengths are close, the superior one between the two is obvious. Since this is a life or death battle, the loser will definitely die. Furthermore, Shui WuBo obviously looks as though he is on the verge of a breakthrough with his swordplay about to reach the level of perfection. Do you think Yu ManLou will leave behind such a threat who can take his life in the future? The outcome is obvious!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian felt his heart shiver! That\u2019s right, if he was in Yu ManLou\u2019s shoes, he would definitely not give up the chance to kill an enemy like Shui WuBo! It wasn\u2019t enough to even cripple him. As long as Shui WuBo could open his mouth, with his experience and knowledge, he would be able to raise a batch of experts for sure! These experts would definitely threaten the safety of the Yu Family!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian could not help but regret. Why didn\u2019t he agree to Shui WuBo\u2019s battle appointment? In the world today, apart from Shui WuBo, how would he be able to find another expert in the sword?</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou chuckled and stood up with a calm smile, \u201cI have long heard that brother WuBo is the number one expert in Heavenly Wind. Your majestic name truly resounds in my ears and it is my honor to exchange blows with brother WuBo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Walking step by step in the plaza, Yu ManLou\u2019s footsteps were filled with immense confidence. His aura was like the boundless ocean, melding together with the heavens and earth.</p><br/><p>The two of them looked at each other with their gazes locked together.</p><br/><p>With the clash of their auras, the spectators present could not help but take a few steps back and the battlefield seemed even more spacious.</p><br/><p>Both of them did not retract their auras and the collision of their auras reached an even higher peak. Very obviously, the two of them intended to gain the upper hand in their very first exchange.</p><br/><p>Would the immense mountain fill up the ocean or would the vast ocean overwhelm the mountain?!</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo and Yu ManLou had solemn looks on their faces without a trace of joy or surprise. Their robes and hair fluttered in the winds and all of the spectators could also feel the violent winds.</p><br/><p>All the experts who had the eyesight to perceive the profoundness of the battle had their eyes glued to the two experts. The clash of two peerless experts was a fortune that could be found but not searched for! If they could comprehend something from the battle, their cultivations would definitely take a huge step forward!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian frowned as he looked at the battlefield with impatience. The way he saw it, the two of them were only trying to act cool. They should just fight if they want to instead of trying to fight each other with their auras. What was the point of doing so when they were experts of the same level? It would be impossible for them to suppress the other party in any case.</p><br/><p>Of course, only Ling Tian had the rights to say such words. After all, he had already scaled higher peaks.</p><br/><p>Just like what Ling Tian had predicted, after having a standoff for a long while, the two of them realized that it was impossible for them to cause any harm to the other party with just their aura. With a loud roar in unison, the two of them retracted their auras.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the spectators all let out a sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe number one expert of Heavenly Wind lives up to your reputation indeed. Seeing you is even better than hearing about you in the rumors.\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s face was solemn and his eyes were chilly. It seems like he had no choice but to bring out his trump cards today.</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo\u2019s face was expressionless as he lifted up his sword, \u201cFamily Head ManLou, please!\u201d</p><br/><p>He stood straight without moving with his sword pointed at Yu ManLou. Despite his sword point not moving even the tiniest bit, everyone could feel that Shui WuBo\u2019s sword had transformed into a large ocean, rushing rapidly towards Yu ManLou!</p><br/><p>A moment before, he was an imposing mountain. At this moment, he turned into the vast ocean. The transformation of the world was so near yet worlds apart!</p><br/><p>\u201cGood sword! Good move!\u201d Yu ManLou bellowed and he walked forward with his arms empty. His boundless aura seemed to have been condensed into a gigantic steel ship, charging fearlessly at the stormy waves!</p><br/><p>The same method, transforming his boundless aura into a powerful assault. Transforming from formless to something with form, how majestic was that!</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo let out a battle cry in response and a sword light exploded forth from the tip of his sword. At this moment, everyone felt as though they were in the pitch darkness with the star-littered sky crashing down like meteors!</p><br/><p>\u201cShower of Milky Way!\u201d In the Shui Family\u2019s camp, someone let out a gasp of shock. No one in the Shui Family would be a stranger to this move and they would have practiced the move as well. However, not a single one of them would be able to unleash the move with such beauty and power!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou spread out his arms and a resplendent sword suddenly appeared in his empty right hand. With a loud roar, he charged into the boundless milky way as though he was a moth flying into the flames!</p><br/><p>The sounds of metal clashing immediately sounded like raindrops splattering on the window. The spectators could no longer see the figures of the two clearly but could only see two balls of lights clashing with each other and feel the boundless sword qi in the place!</p><br/><p>The thousands of spectators in the plaza could feel the boundless sword qi from the resplendent beams of light!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about it?\u201d Ling Tian looked at the plaza and asked.</p><br/><p>While Ling Tian did not turn back to look at him, Ling Jian knew that his young noble was questioning him. He looked at the two individuals and took in a deep breath, \u201cVery powerful. They are truly very powerful. While I would be able to fight them, the outcome would not be optimistic!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a low grunt and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Ah\u2019Jian, you can finally understand your own strength. While you have reached their realm, you are unable to conceal your edge and reach the realm of reverting to simplicity. If you were the one in battle, while your moves would be more vicious than theirs and you might be able to end the battle in a few moves, you are gleaming with killing intent and sharpness but lacking in stability and dullness. Thus, your chances of victory wouldn\u2019t be high against either of the two!\u201d</p><br/><p>After pausing for a moment, Ling Tian smiled, \u201cOf course, regardless of who faces you, they would definitely have a huge headache. Especially the few minutes at the start of the battle! The most likely outcome would be you ending in mutual destruction with the two of them! However, there is a small difference. If you face Shui WuBo, the two of you will not have a chance to survive and mutual destruction would be the only outcome. But if you face Yu ManLou, it is very likely to end in your death and with him being heavily injured!\u201d</p><br/><p>After finishing those words, Ling Tian pondered for a moment before saying with certainty, \u201cI am at least 80% confident in my estimates.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian said in agreement, \u201cEven if I face Shui WuBo in battle, I will probably be slightly inferior to him. However, young noble\u2019s exquisite swordplay and movement techniques would be able to cover up for this gap.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled slightly and said, \u201cThe swordplay of these two individuals has already reached a bottleneck. This bottleneck would be letting out their sword qi! They have already stopped at this realm temporarily. If Shui WuBo is able to survive this battle, he may be able to break this bottleneck of his!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLetting out their sword qi?\u201d Ling Jian was a little puzzled, \u201cThis is already the peak of being one with the sword. Why does young noble say that it is a bottleneck? Also, didn\u2019t young noble say that Shui WuBo isn\u2019t a match for Yu ManLou? Why would Shui WuBo achieve a breakthrough first?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian said with a clear voice, \u201cCultivating sword intent is the first step. From sword intent to sword qi is the next step. But when sword qi reaches its peak, it needs to revert back to the origin. This is sword qi being restrained! The clash of these two experts is earth shattering and heaven shaking. If anyone from the audience suffers from the aftershock of the sword qi, they would definitely be injured. However, if the two experts are able to restrain their sword qi, they would be able to target whoever they wish and lock their sword qi on only a single person! This lock of their sword qi would be able to achieve the accuracy of a hair\u2019s breadth! At that time, it would be the true accomplishment of the sword art!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see.\u201d Ling Jian came to a realization and a look of yearning could be seen on his face, \u201cSo that is the peak of the sword way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong!\u201d Ling Tian corrected, \u201cThat would be the peak of the sword art at the most but not the peak of the sword way! Even if one is able to attain such heights in sword arts, it would only be the door to the sword way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face flushed red immediately and his eyes began glowing with a burning gaze, \u201cSword way? Just the door?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian replied with a calm smile, \u201cYou will understand when you reach such a realm. Explaining too much to you now would only be detrimental to your cultivation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian immediately acknowledged with a nod of his head, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then continued, \u201cShui WuBo is a martial fanatic and is extremely talented. He dedicated his life to the study of martial arts and the sword way and he has already caught a glimpse of the door to the sword way. If he can see through life and death, he would definitely be able to attain a higher realm. While Yu ManLou\u2019s talent is superior to Shui WuBo, it is a pity that he is bogged down by the matters of the Yu Family. Furthermore, he also learned too many miscellaneous arts and it is impossible for him to take another step forward. While Shui WuBo\u2019s strength is inferior to Yu ManLou, his dedication to the sword would give him a chance to achieve a further breakthrough. Thus, Yu ManLou\u2019s sword art will only stop at this level!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian immediately understood the intricacies of what Ling Tian had explained and felt as though he had learned plenty!</p><br/><p>The battle in the plaza had already reached its peak with sword qi running rampant and the sound of their swords clashing becoming extremely dense.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s brows furrowed as he said, \u201cYu ManLou is going to unleash his killing blow.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Ling Jian wasn\u2019t able to spot anything and asked, \u201cKilling blow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s gaze turned solemn, \u201cShui WuBo\u2019s martial arts are beyond Yu ManLou\u2019s expectations. In order to win against such an opponent, Yu ManLou will definitely have to take out a trump card capable of suppressing Shui WuBo. Furthermore, Yu ManLou\u2019s complexion is turning green and slightly black. This is definitely the prelude to a killing blow. With Yu ManLou\u2019s martial arts, if not for the fact that he wants to unleash an evil art, there shouldn\u2019t be a reason for his complexion to have such an odd change! Look carefully! Right at this moment!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after Ling Tian\u2019s words, a loud roar could be heard in the plaza and a gray shadow shot up towards the sky with a resplendent sword glow! Yu ManLou!</p><br/><p>Shooting up to the sky!</p><br/><p>A hint of doubt flashed past Shui WuBo\u2019s eyes but he did not hesitate in the slightest. He was extremely clear that Yu ManLou\u2019s next move wasn\u2019t one that would be easy for him to guard against! Retracting his sword, a large blue colored lotus bloomed in the middle of the plaza and rapidly expanded upwards!</p><br/><p>Shui WuBo\u2019s figure also transformed into the stem that supported the gigantic lotus flower.</p><br/><p>In mid-air, Yu ManLou\u2019s roar had not ended and none of them had noticed when his body spun around. He held onto his sword with both his hands and he seemed to have transformed into a gigantic spear, stabbing downwards mercilessly! Apart from the slight glow on the tip of his sword, he was clad in complete darkness!</p><br/><p>The boundless killing intent together with the chilliness of the underworld filled the entire place. This was a sword filled completely with death!</p><br/><p>In this instant, everyone felt their hair stand up on edge! At this instant, it was as though the evilest entity had descended upon Mount Vacant! It was as though they were in a ghost town of the yellow river with the sound of ghosts whispering in their ears! It was extremely terrifying!</p></div>\n</div>"}

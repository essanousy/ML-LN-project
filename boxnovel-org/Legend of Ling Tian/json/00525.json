Then, he suddenly pulled Xiao YanXue over from her horse and gave her a kiss on the cheek. At the same time, he kicked his horse and roared out loudly, \u201cI, Hu HanSan, am back again\u2026 \u201d 1</p><br/><p>Amid Xiao YanXue\u2019s complaining, the two horses gradually disappeared into the distance.</p><br/><p>If Li Xue was really mad, the consequences would be dire! Ling Tian knew that someone would definitely be in trouble for sure! This great aunt\u2019s methods were truly devious and merciless. Anyone who provoked her would definitely not have a good ending. Ling Jian was cool enough but was toyed with to the point that he almost cried. Ling Chen\u2019s status was high enough, but she was still forcefully trained! Even if Ling Tian was around, if he accidentally provoked her, he would definitely be taught a good lesson as well!</p><br/><p>A ferocious character like her was one that no one dared to provoke\u2026</p><br/><p>In this period of time, the horrendous behavior of the Shui Family members made Li Xue and Ling Chen to be fed up to the extreme. These two women had truly witnessed first hand what the saying \u2018incapable of accomplishing anything and only capable of ruining things\u2019 meant! If not for the fact that the two ladies had to consider the effects these people had on Ling Tian\u2019s plans, the two of them would have definitely slaughtered all of the Shui Family members! The two ladies had actually agreed on this point with complete harmony!</p><br/><p>At the same time, under the patient guidance of Li Xue, Yu BingYan also had some accomplishment in melding martial arts into painting and painting into martial arts. She was currently in a state of sudden enlightenment and was cultivating in seclusion. It wasn\u2019t surprising to see her disappear for a few days, and she was fully focused on her painting and martial arts only. This carefree lifestyle of hers had made both Ling Chen and Li Xue extremely envious.</p><br/><p>After Ling Chen and Shui QianRou had fixed the plan in the Courtyard, Shui QianRou excitedly returned to where her Shui Family was residing and gathered her cousins and elders to discuss the matter. After describing the plan of working together with the Ling Family to ambush the returning Yu Family\u2019s forces, she never imagined that her three cousins and the six elders were completely disinterested in the matter. It was as though she had been doused with a bucket of water.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince both of our families are working together, why won\u2019t the Ling Family send any men? If our Shui Family is to be fully in charge of assaulting the Yu Family\u2019s troops, wouldn\u2019t it be equivalent to working for the Ling Family? Are you trying to trick a little child?!\u201d These were the original words of Shui QianHu.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we are working together, both parties must display their sincerity. On what basis can the Ling Family not send any men but only provide us with information? Do they take us to be blind and deaf, incapable of getting information on our own? Don\u2019t they know that we can also send out our scouts? What is the point of working with the Ling Family if they aren\u2019t going to contribute anything?\u201d These were Shui QianJiang\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, the Ling and Yu Families are in-laws in name, so how would we know if this is just a plan to trap our Shui Family? We have to be extremely cautious at this moment, and it doesn\u2019t pay to be careless!\u201d This was Shui QianHai.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if their information is extremely accurate and they have the sincerity to work with us, the Ling Family is only a nouveau riche family that we can wipe out with a snap of our fingers. What right do they have to work with us? Alliance partners? Is their Ling Family even worthy? QianRou, you and your brother made a mistake when deciding to form an alliance with the Ling Family. We are a family that has been around for a thousand years and not any random family is fit to work together with us! The two of you have truly thrown the face of our Shui Family!\u201d This was what a few of the elders said. These old men were obviously still holding onto the former glory of the Shui Family and were unfamiliar with the present circumstance of the world!</p><br/><p>Only the fifth elder did not say anything nasty but said in a solemn tone, \u201cWe are in the midst of chaotic times and this matter must be discussed further. We cannot make rash decisions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou felt an endless grief and disappointment. For herself, for the people in front of her, and for the Shui Family! A thousand-year legacy, a thousand years of glory, and a thousand years of stability. Why have things developed to such a state? Why doesn\u2019t anyone in the family have any foresight? Why are they all so arrogant and full of themselves? Such a family was far too different from the ideal family that she was loyal to in her heart!</p><br/><p>Complete disappointment! This was her only feeling. The Ling Family isn\u2019t worthy? Then who is? In truth, probably the Ling Family is the one who has the right to say \u2018you aren\u2019t worth to form an alliance with my Ling Family\u2019 in the Heavenly Star Continent. To think that her Shui Family actually had the cheek to say that the Ling Family wasn\u2019t worthy. Wasn\u2019t that too foolish of them?!</p><br/><p>Who was the one who isn\u2019t worthy?!</p><br/><p>Discuss the matter further? The Yu Family members would retreat in three to five days time! How long were they going to discuss the matter? Discuss the matter until the point where the Yu Family is safely tucked into their beds in Bright Jade City before taking action? What was the point of the mission then? Was it for us to go out and be slaughtered?</p><br/><p>The Shui Family had a thousand years of foundation and was the number one family of the Heavenly Wind Continent. When were they reduced to such a state? Was it because they could rule over the Heavenly Wind Continent smoothly without anyone to oppose them? Were they no longer used to forming an alliance of equal status?!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou even heard the suggestion to wait for Ling Tian\u2019s safe return to Sky Bearing before talking about an alliance!</p><br/><p>When she heard those words, Shui QianRou really felt helpless to the extreme! If they were to wait for Ling Tian to return, perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be an alliance anymore but their Shui Family would be toyed with in the palm of Ling Tian\u2019s hand from the beginning to the end! At the end of the \u2018alliance\u2019, all of them might end up having to stay behind in Sky Bearing forever!</p><br/><p>Was Ling Tian someone who was so easily dealt with?</p><br/><p>Admittedly, while the Ling Family did indeed have the upper hand in the current alliance with her Shui Family, the circumstances before them forced them to accept such terms and they were helpless against it. First, their Shui Family troops had to rely on the Ling Family for food, a place to stay, and the concealment of their whereabouts. To put it in a nasty way, if their Shui Family were to leave the Ling Family, even if they had a multitude of martial arts experts, they were blind and deaf in the Heavenly Star Continent! Furthermore, Shui QianRou still needed to rely on the Ling Family to protect her brother, Shui QianHuan. Just based on these two points alone, Shui QianRou was definitely willing to accept slight losses to form this alliance with the Ling Family.</p><br/><p>Apart from these two points, there was a third, most important, point. The ones who they were forming an alliance with currently was the Ling Family Courtyard with Ling Chen at the helm. While Ling Chen wasn\u2019t someone easy to deal with either, it was still far easier to deal with her than Ling Tian. After all, she was now sworn sisters with Ling Chen and everything could be discussed. Even if she were to suffer some losses, it wouldn\u2019t be because of some insidious scheme. Thus, Shui QianRou did indeed wish for Ling Tian\u2019s return to be delayed. The moment Ling Tian returned to Sky Bearing, things definitely wouldn\u2019t be the same anymore. That person was at least a hundred times more frightening than Ling Chen! Even if that guy went crazy and killed all thousand of their Shui Family troops, Shui QianRou wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was someone who had never played his cards in a normal way! At the same time, Shui QianRou had never seen him suffer a loss before!</p><br/><p>But when she reported everything to the members of the Shui Family in front of her, including everything that had happened, had not happened, or would possibly happen, they all mocked her for exaggerating the facts to cover up her faults. They still felt that Ling Tian was just the infamous profligate young noble of Sky Bearing\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing the people in front of her talking about the situation of the continent with a face full of confidence, with their spittle flying in all directions and ambition oozing out of their every action, Shui QianRou\u2019s final glimmer of hope disappeared completely. At this moment, this strong and stubborn lady felt an endless despair and helplessness!</p><br/><p>Just when Shui QianRou felt tired of all this and wanted to leave the premise quietly, Shui QianHu looked towards her with a profound look. \u201cYounger sister Rou, I heard that this number one profligate young master in Sky Bearing is extremely charming and has an exceptional elegance. I wonder if this is truly the case?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou looked at him and replied emotionlessly, \u201cWhat does second cousin mean by that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianHu chuckled and a look of mockery could be seen in his eyes, \u201cI heard that younger sister Rou had met young noble Ling Tian on multiple occasions and hated the fact that you did not know him earlier. The two of you would usually talk through the night and were inseparable like glue. I believe that younger sister Rou must be very worried about him upon hearing the news that he is being chased by the Martial Order Medallion owner,\u201d Shui QianHu said with an eccentric tone.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou raised her head up and retorted, \u201cRubbish!\u201d At the same time, tears began welling up in her eyes. For the family, I did so many things that went against my conscience and even personally attempted to assassinate my beloved man. On top of that, I even plotted against his family and was scolded by him in my face while witnessing his killing intent and hatred for me. The rift between the two of them had fractured to the point it was irreversible, and all of this filled Shui QianRou with despair and grief. The only thing that kept her going was the loyalty towards her family! However, to think that someone from her family would actually accuse her in such a manner?!</p><br/><p>A trace of jealousy could be seen in Shui QianJiang\u2019s eyes as he said coldly, \u201cNonsense? Younger sister Rou, we must have struck your sore spot right? For you to be so stubborn about working with that small and insignificant family as well as how you fought so hard for the benefits of the Ling Family, do you already treat yourself as a member of the Ling Family? Are you trying to be a virtuous daughter-in-law of the Ling Family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou was angered to the point her body began trembling and her eyes turned red. \u201cShui QianJiang! The lot of you better not malign me! I have always been open and upright in my actions and I would never be so despicable as to betray the family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDespicable? Hahaha\u2026\u201d Shui QianHuan laughed evilly, \u201cThis matter has already spread throughout the family in Heavenly Wind and there isn\u2019t anyone unaware about this matter! You also know that this is a despicable action? How can you even have the face to say those words? Just how much energy and resources did the family exhaust to groom you for the past ten-plus years? How many precious medicines and herbs did the family use to raise your strength? Now that your wings are fully grown and you have found a groom do you remember what it means to betray the family? Do you dare to say that you aren\u2019t fond of that profligate Ling Tian?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy heart has not changed, and I have never done anything that betrayed the interests of the family! I, Shui QianRou, swear to the heaven that if I did anything that betrayed the family, I will be willing to face the family punishment of being torn apart by five horses and die a horrible death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026 what a good oath! You are the daughter of the present family head. When would the punishment of being torn apart by five horses be used on you? You actually dare to take out such a pitiful oath to scare us! Shui QianRou, why don\u2019t you dare to answer my answer directly. Do you know that your current words are extremely despicable?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

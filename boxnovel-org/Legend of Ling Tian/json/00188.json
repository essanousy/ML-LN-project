Today, Third Master Yu was destined to have his name dragged through the mud for the next ten thousand years. A martial arts expert whose opponents could be numbered on his two hands, a brilliant star, actually took the initiative to challenge a weak scholar with no cultivation background! Even those strong bullying the weak weren\u2019t like this! Yu ManTian suddenly felt that he was a despicable and shameless bastard!</p><br/><p>At this point, Yu ManTian was between a rock and a hard place for the first time in his life! He suddenly felt as though he was a fool, a complete fool! He only heard from his brother how extraordinary this guy was, and how outstanding he was, which made him so unconvinced that he ran over here immediately. But did he even ask what point he was outstanding in? A grand total of a thousand miles of road! [1] He had sat on a horse till his buttocks ached, and even met two lunatics and tasted his first defeat, though he had his fill of fighting! Ai! What a tough journey.</p><br/><p>But now, what could he do? Compare martial skills? He could forget about it, his opponent didn\u2019t even have the ability to protect himself! Then what about the Four Arts? He might as well take his own life!</p><br/><p>Of course, Ling Tian would definitely provide Yu ManTian a way out of this mess! Seeing how Third Master Yu stood there dumbly without doing anything like a maligned boy not knowing how to solve the problem, Ling Tian resisted the urge to laugh, and thinking quickly he replied, \u201cAnyway, before we talk about competing or not, it is only right for me to host you well for coming a long way here. While I, Ling Tian, don\u2019t have much that could catch your eye, I do have a few good jars of wine. I wonder if Third Master would be interested?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment wine was mentioned, Third Master Yu immediately woke up from his stupor, and looking at the two empty jars of wine held in his hands, he immediately opened his mouth, \u201cThere\u2019s more of this kind of wine? You should have said so earlier! Where is it, I\u2019ll go and grab it!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the time it took to finish his sentence, Third Master Yu\u2019s expression went through an astonishing change, from shame and embarrassment to a greedy and voracious look! His tongue that had just tasted the heavenly wine was already starting to peek out, tracing his lips.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan forced out another smile. That Third Uncle of hers was really a piece of art, and she couldn\u2019t even say that she didn\u2019t know him anymore, how embarrassing!</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh!\u201d Ling Tian revealed a look of disdain, \u201cHow is that considered good wine! That\u2019s for the servants to indulge. As for the actual top grade ones, this junior definitely isn\u2019t lacking!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian had long forgotten his previous shame and humiliation, immediately taking a step and appearing in front of Ling Tian as he waved his hands in excitement, \u201cHahaha, brother, are\u2026 are you serious?\u201d In his jubilation, he didn\u2019t even realize that he was here to cause trouble, and even called Ling Tian brother!</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Master, please have a seat, I\u2019ll bring the wine!\u201d Ling Tian turned to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cPa!\u201d Third Master Yu gave Ling Tian a smack on his shoulder as he laughed, \u201cGood! This brother really is generous! Please bring more jars over!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed in response and walked away. The insensitive Third Master Yu never noticed how Ling Tian seemed to be unaffected by his good-natured slap on the shoulder! Given Yu ManTian\u2019s strength, this affectionate gesture he saved for his pugilistic world friends wasn\u2019t something a weak scholar could take, even though there was no internal energy involved!</p><br/><p>Gazing at his silhouette, Third Master Yu\u2019s face broke into all smiles, \u201cThis guy sure is generous!\u201d Turning around, he caught sight of his niece, holding onto the table for support for her dear life as she continued laughing madly. He felt his face heat up, and couldn\u2019t help but put on a stern expression of a berating senior as he hollered, \u201cWhat are you laughing at! Haven\u2019t you seen your Third Uncle drink before? To think that you are unaware of decorum, disgraceful! You\u2019re tarnishing our family\u2019s name!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan stood dumbly as she heard that. What was her uncle talking about? Talking about tarnishing our family\u2019s name, do you even need me? Why don\u2019t you ask all the people on the scene, and see if whatever I did actually tarnished our family\u2019s reputation?</p><br/><p>Having said this, Yu ManTian came to a stop once again as he remembered his original objective for coming here. It was to obstruct his precious niece from interacting with the famed silkpants of the continent. So why did he address Ling Tian as brother already?</p><br/><p>Having thought about it for a while, he threw it at the back of his mind by comforting himself, thinking, Let\u2019s think more after I\u2019ve drunk his wine. His wine was really good, really fragrant! The more he thought about the wine he was going to get, the more comforted he felt and happily settled down on a bamboo chair, with the chair groaning, on the verge of totally collapsing.</p><br/><p>A few minutes passed when Ling Tian was seen briskly walking back. At his back was the head of the Residence Guards, Wang Tong, with each hand holding on to two large jars of wine, carrying them as though he was shifting furniture.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian leaped up from his chair, laughing, immediately appearing in front of Wang Tong. With a flick of his arms, he cradled all four jars in his bosom, akin to a child who had just gotten its beloved toy. That movement and speed was enough to prove that his skill was of high caliber.</p><br/><p>Wang Tong only felt a blur pass by before the four jars disappeared into someone else\u2019s bosom. His pupils shrank, revealing a gaze as sharp as a blade as his hands secretly stretched towards his own blade!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian stopped him with a slight shake of his head, lightly waving his hands. Wang Tong understood the meaning immediately and bowed once before taking his leave.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian laughed at the scene. Seeing Wang Tong\u2019s retreating figure, he grinned as he said, \u201cThat guard\u2019s martial arts doesn\u2019t seem too bad. Why didn\u2019t you let him try me out?\u201d Yu ManTian might be insensitive, but that didn\u2019t refer to his senses for danger! While Wang Tong\u2019s moves were stealthy and well hidden, how could it slip past Yu ManTian\u2019s senses?</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Master is here as a guest, so how could I be disrespectful? The family servant was being impolite!\u201d Ling Tian merely replied indifferently, as he smiled. \u201cFurthermore, I\u2019ve long heard that Third Master\u2019s martial arts are unparalleled, so how could you place a mere guard in your eye?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian beamed so hugely that his eyes were almost covered. If not for his hands holding onto the wine jars, he would have patted him on the shoulder once again. \u201cHahaha, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right, this Third Master will not lower myself to his level.\u201d Walking to the table, he gingerly placed the jars down, before opening one of the cork seals. A heady fragrance wafted out, letting him close his eyes, breathing in the fumes in bliss.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s white robe billowed as he came to his side. Fishing out one of the jugs, he smiled widely at the ladies as he said, \u201cThis jar was prepared specially for you ladies. Today is a happy day, and calls for celebration!\u201d As for what he was happy about, or what he was celebrating, Ling Tian didn\u2019t say. Only Ling Chen understood the reason for his happiness, and her face immediately blushed a crimson red as she quickly turned her face to the side. However, a pink tinge that lingered in her eyes betrayed her current mood.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian guffawed with laughter as he opened the cork in one smooth move. An ephemeral and illusory fragrance filled the air, like the stuff that dreams were made of. This was Ling Tian\u2019s invention, his unique wine the \u2018Maiden\u2019s Heart\u2019!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian specially poured a cup for each of the three ladies present, carrying the cups to them. Yu BingYan and Wei XuanXuan stared on with curious looks, wondering why Ling Tian was so eager to snatch away Ling Chen\u2019s job? However, the moment they took a sip, all coherent thoughts flowed away as they were conquered by the illusory fantasy they experienced from the wine. All they could do was continuously sip the wine while praising it.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian walked over to Ling Chen, approaching her ear as he teased in a low voice, \u201cChen\u2019er, how does the wine taste?\u201d</p><br/><p>Though it seemed impossible, Ling Chen\u2019s face got redder from his words. Stretching out a hand smooth as jade, she nimbly and ruthlessly tugged at Ling Tian\u2019s waist and twisted. Ling Tian was left to grin and bear it, as he couldn\u2019t let out any sound, which resulted in him having a weird expression. He couldn\u2019t help but inwardly regret digging his own grave. However, his heart was filled with the strands of love, resulting in a contradictory moment of feeling happiness amidst suffering\u2026</p><br/><p>Off to the side, Yu ManTian wasn\u2019t one to be polite, and before the three ladies had even finished their cups he had already downed five to six of the same size cups. Only then did he breathe out in satisfaction, praising, \u201cGood wine!\u201d He paused a while, pondering, before continuing, \u201cEven better than the previous wine! But there\u2019s no way to compare it, all the fine wines I\u2019ve ever tasted were all dog sh*t compared to this!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could it not be good? This was the \u2018Drunken Immortal Soul\u2019 that Ling Tian had used to personally receive Ye QingChen! Under the vast heavens, only at Ling Tian\u2019s place was it possible to sample it. This privilege was restricted only to their house and none others! Other than Ling Chen and Ling Tian, absolutely no one knew of its existence, let alone drank it!</p><br/><p>Now that Yu ManTian was indulging in wine, he looked more refined, almost like a prince amongst wines! Other than drinking it a little faster than others, he displayed none of the coarseness he normally brought with him. This was indeed \u2018refinement within boorishness\u2019, and you could even say that it was the epitome of refinement!</p><br/><p>One could only see Third Master Yu carefully lifting up the wine jar, cautiously pouring it into the cups, and then gingerly taking up the cup to drain it in one shot, not even wasting a single drop!</p><br/><p>[1] The Chinese mile (li) is 500 meters, so a thousand miles is 500 kilometers or 300 standard miles.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

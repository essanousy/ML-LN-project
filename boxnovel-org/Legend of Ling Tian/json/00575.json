In his thirty years of command, he had never received such huge losses as well! This was furthermore the first time he had sacrificed so much, and still not achieved a victory!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis will go down in history as the most miserable and desperate battle!\u201d Beside Xiao FengYang, an old man clad in gold battle armor solemnly stared at this sight, before saying in a heavy tone, \u201cIn my entire wartime experience, never have I seen such a miserable battle like today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSound the drums to retreat!\u201d Xiao FengYang was shaken awake by his words. While the mountain pass had been broken through, allowing his troops to advance, the mountain pass was also completely destroyed before they could use it. By retreating, he could still reduce his losses by a bit. He could utilize his elite troops to be the vanguard in conquering it! Unless the Ling Family was willing to hold a decisive battle here with his troops, there was no other meaning for them to continue to hold the fort.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander, the optimal time has already been lost!\u201d The golden armored general regretfully shook his head. \u201cWe can only send down the command, telling those who have yet to engage to retreat. As for those that had been sent out, we cannot pull them back anymore. None of them are able to listen to orders anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir mental states have already been scrambled by the massacre. As a result, the gong of retreat is as good as the signal to charge further.\u201d The general sighed. \u201cThis is also the reason why a crazed battlefield will never produce any cowards. Once the war gets heated up to such a state, even if I were to throw the world\u2019s number one coward inside, he would also become iron blooded warrior ready to sacrifice himself at any point! A pity that this war has already taken the lives of 20,000 of our hot-blooded sons of the Xiao Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!!\u201d Xiao FengYang screamed with reddened eyes and heavy breathing, \u201cRetreat! Sound the retreat!! Get everyone back!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A startling drumbeat reverberated through the battlefield, but the Xiao Family troops facing the Ling soldiers did not even bat an eyelid in response. All of them actually did not even acknowledge the sound at all!</p><br/><p>Their senses were already fully focused inside this frantic slaughter-fest! Other than annihilating the opposite party, no other thoughts existed inside their heads anymore!</p><br/><p>More and more reinforcements from the Ling Family came out, and one by one, red flags started to be hoisted up amid the sea of corpses!</p><br/><p>From afar, the thunderous sound of hoofbeats ceaselessly sounded. The faint blood-red flags fluttered like an azure dragon soaring in the sky. That was the sound of the Ling Family\u2019s reinforcements!</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang let out a drawn-out sigh. Now that he knew the overall outcome of the situation, he closed both his eyes tightly as two streams of tears suddenly flowed out, \u201cA whole 45,000 troops! 45,000 troops!!! Just because of this old man\u2019s carelessness, countless people are laid to rest in this spot. This old man deserves death! Why did I even place the Southeast sector in my eyes? How am I going to face the cries and wails of those widows and mothers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Master doesn\u2019t need to worry. Since time immemorial, what war did not have sacrifices? To be gentle and not bring troops to war means that one will never be able to wield wealth. We\u2019re still waiting for Second Master to take charge of the general situation!\u201d The old man consoled.</p><br/><p>A thick scent of blood wafted through the skies in the battlefield, pervading ten miles around the area!</p><br/><p>This bitter and desperate killing had finally drawn its curtains and come to the end!</p><br/><p>Outside Sobbing Ghost Mountain, corpses were disorderly strewn about lying on the ground. There were no injured men during this battle, only dead or alive! Normally on a battlefield, the aftermath would be filled with groans and screams of misery, yet this area was devoid of sound!</p><br/><p>As for the corpses lying on the ground, none of them were whole! Under such circumstances, it would be an impossibility to have someone who could walk out alive. Only the heads of the soldiers remained staring at the sky, their eyes still wide open in killing intent and anger, staring at the heavens themselves.</p><br/><p>As for where the entrance of the mountain pass was supposed to be, all the bodies had already been mashed into chunks of flesh and blood paste. Enemies and comrades could not be told apart. The brave warriors from both sides who had staked their lives just a few moments ago were now intertwined with each other, without any way to distinguish between them whatsoever!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this ironic?</p><br/><p>This was war. The bloodiest, most desperate war!</p><br/><p>Fresh blood flowed unceasingly, pooling together. They slowly merged to form a river of blood, and under the rays of sunlight, they painted the entire mountain pass a scarlet red, overriding all other colors present!</p><br/><p>Silence reigned between heaven and earth!</p><br/><p>The gloomy and suppressive killing atmosphere hung like overcast clouds over the entire area, and even the screaming autumn wind seemed to have quietened down all of a sudden. It was as though they were paying a moment of tribute to the fallen brave souls!</p><br/><p>In front of the Xiao Family\u2019s army formation, Xiao FengYang stood there with a numb expression on his face, as though he was a crafted sculpture.</p><br/><p>Countless commands were suddenly shouted out, and the thunderous sounds of hoofbeats sounded. Out from the mountain pass came countless blood-red battle flags, and valiant soldiers walked out line after line from the mountain pass.</p><br/><p>The reinforcements stepped across all the corpses strewn on the ground, appearing in front of Xiao FengYang for a direct confrontation!</p><br/><p>Since the strategic value of the mountain pass was no longer reliable, then they might as well face him head-on. Besides, they could attack and retreat anytime they deemed fit. On this point, the Ling Family\u2019s general made the best choice.</p><br/><p>While the Ling Family indeed possessed a troop count of more than ten thousand lower than Xiao FengYang, they were technically warring within their own area, and so long as they kept defending at this particular location, there would be an unceasing number of troops reinforcing them. As for the Xiao Family, they had pushed deep within enemy territory to attack. While their troops might be the elite soldiers, their numbers would only dwindle over time. Without the power to obtain a decisive victory, the morale of the troops would be sure to drop!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis battle was unbelievably desperate and cruel. The corpses on the ground, be it allies or enemies were all brave warriors! They are not to be defiled!\u201d The general of the army hollered out from his horseback. \u201cThe various soldiers, do your fastest to separate the bodies of our allies from our enemies and bring the remains of our Ling Family warriors back into the pass. For the Xiao Family\u2019s soldiers, send them to the opposing forces. When two forces battle, each has their respective masters, and if there are any injuries or death, they are not to hold them against each other! However, the brave warrior\u2019s remains must be put to rest!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d The soldiers behind responded in one voice, followed by hundreds of them jumping down from their horses and beginning to get busy.</p><br/><p>At this time, Xiao FengYang also slowly began to regain his calmness. He gazed with rapt attention in the distance, and recognized someone, causing his body to have a single tremble. He clenched his teeth for a while, the expression on his face ever-changing, before suddenly nudging his horse towards the center area between the two armies. He spoke in a low gravelly tone, \u201cLord Yu, it has been a long time. I never thought that Sky Bearing would actually employ you, the War Minister himself, against me. I am really flattered!\u201d</p><br/><p>The general from the Ling Family was precisely the person who the Ling Family entrusted this battle to, the previous assistant minister of war, Yu YanHai. While his military merits and his skills did not match up to Shen RuHu and Ling Xiao, when it came to military strategy, he was definitely not inferior to them in any aspect. This, coupled with his experience and knowledge, allowed him to be extremely rigorous, an expert in both offense and defense. Especially regarding defense, inside Sky Bearing, and maybe even the entire Heavenly Star, not many could compare. Thus he was definitely the best choice for the battle this time.</p><br/><p>It was because Xiao FengYang knew him, and furthermore knew him extremely well, that he knew this battle was not good to fight, and furthermore extremely unusual!</p><br/><p>Yu YanHai had on a cold expression, as he casually waved his hands and said, \u201cHow is that so, Second Master Xiao is too polite. Second Master is a master of military strategy, so how can I even compare to you? This Yu has trapped himself inside Sky Bearing, not coming out in the last few years, so how would I be compared to the great Second Master Xiao, who has great influence and has gathered the troops to conquer the continent? Second Master Xiao is helping the Xiao Family to expand its territories, and that is a great accomplishment!\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xiao FengYang not be able to tell apart the ridicule within his words? He merely retained a poker face as he said, \u201cBrother Yu is really polite. We brothers have not seen each other for so many years, could it be that we have to immediately war against each other the moment we meet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu YanHai coldly snorted as a gleam shot through his eyes. He spat, \u201cIf Second Master Xiao is willing to retreat, and expand elsewhere, then this Yu will definitely not dare to offend Second Master\u2019s prestige!\u201d His meaning was: If you aren\u2019t willing to leave, then I\u2019ll have to offend you!</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang\u2019s face grew cold as well, and his voice turned sinister, \u201cYu YanHai, don\u2019t think that I\u2019m afraid of you. I merely respect you as a rare hero of a generation and do not wish for such a hero to die here. If you\u2019re still tactful, then you had better clear this road quickly!\u201d His facial expression suddenly took on a 180-degree change. \u201cActually, brother Yu is a great talent, and if you\u2019re willing to follow my Xiao Family, then I, Xiao FengYang can help to attest to you, elder brother. When we conquer the continent and create a dynasty, within the high ranking officials, Brother Yu will definitely take one of the top 5 seats!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu YanHan only laughed as he spoke, \u201cSecond Master Xiao really gives this country bumpkin here too much credit. However, since we\u2019re on this topic, this Yu indeed has a matter that I wish to seek guidance on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang could only reply with a heavy expression, \u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Xiao Family has been the hegemon of the Northeastern side for the past few centuries and sits strategically surrounded by mountains and rivers, protected by nature with no need to fear invasion from enemies. It could be said that you people are living in a world of paradise, but yet you throw away such a peaceful time and so many lives in your country? Your ancestors once decreed that the descendants of the Xiao Family would forever not take part in any wars in the continent. Could it be that Second Master has forgotten the teachings of your ancestors?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu YanHai poked a finger at all the bloodshed, and the various corpses, bleakly saying, \u201cThose people could have been benevolent fathers and filial sons, brothers in arms, harmonious couples, enjoying life to their fullest. Yet they now all lie within this area, buried in a foreign land, all because of your Xiao Family\u2019s ambitions! If you continue with your plan, then just how many orphans and widows will be created? Brother Xiao, why must you be so cruel? Are you really not afraid of going against the oath of your ancestors?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang\u2019s eyes sharpened, staring at the corpses all messily strewn on the ground. A wave of pain brushed past his eyes but was quickly suppressed and he ruthlessly waved it off. \u201cI, of course, have carved the words of my ancestors deep into my heart, not daring to forget it for even a moment. However, the ancestor himself was also worried that because the world was always embroiled in war, we would one day also lose the last piece of pure land that belonged to us. Hence, he had also said that so long as the world was not fully unified, there will never be peace, and the people of the world will never truly know happiness! Thus, only by unifying the continent can we then avoid strife. As a descendant of the Xiaos, I obey and wish to unify this place, to create a utopia where my Xiao Family can live happily ever after. This is clear proof! To create happiness and joy for the various common folk of the world, what wrong is there in doing so? Instead, it is you who do not follow the wishes of the heavens and of the common folk, obstructing the heavenly troops without careful consideration, causing rivers of blood to flow. Your Ling Family is the true offender!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha\u2026 this is the best joke I\u2019ve ever heard!\u201d Yu YanHai let out a cold snort, as he disdainfully replied, \u201cSo it turns out that you leading troops to invade us make sense, and it is complying with the rules of heaven. However, us not willing to allow you to invade our motherland actually makes us criminals, going against Heaven\u2019s rules?! What a preposterous idea, complete nonsense! Xiao FengYang, in my entire life I, Yu YanHai, have seen quite a few shameless people, but I just found out that you totally just refreshed my ranking list! Respect, much respect, for a person to have reached such levels in thick-skinned behavior like you, it could be because the skin on the left side of your face had appeared in the right side as well! This is because you\u2019re not just thick-skinned, but also two-faced in reality! I believe that no one can be your match!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang\u2019s face turned frosty at that, and killing intent started to flow out in waves.</p><br/><p>At this time, a logistics section leader ran over, and saluted to Yu YanHai, saying, \u201cReporting to general. We have separated the bodies, and those who can be recognized number at 8,744 for our men, and 15,320 men for the enemy. However, there are still remaining bodies that cannot be identified at all and can only be muddled together. How do we proceed, general?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c8,744, 15,320\u2026 \u201d Yu YanHai\u2019s beard trembled as he furiously stared at Xiao FengYang, \u201cSecond Master Xiao, do you hear that? These two startling numbers represent human lives! And furthermore, there is still a heap that cannot be recognized, even the bodies not found! In just these two days, both sides lost more than 60,000 people in total! In this world, this would mean another 60,000 broken families! Having you ever thought about this, Xiao FengYang? This is what your Xiao Family calls living in peace? I think it is bringing disaster to the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Xiao FengYang merely replied with a sneer, \u201cPedantic! I actually thought that you, Yu YanHai would be considered a great character, but to think that you actually are so pedantic! Don\u2019t you understand the saying, \u201cEven if I want to sacrifice my life for my country, why should I be wrapped inside horse\u2019s hide after my death?\u201d As a person who has been through numerous wars, dying on the battlefield is my honor and glory, and my purpose in life! Where is the sadness in that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu YanHai\u2019s face turned green, and he hatefully spat out, \u201cShameless! I thought I was already used to the various shameless people on earth, but today, after having met you, I realized just how much of a frog in a well I am!\u201d Turning back, he hollered to his subordinates, \u201cTake 500 men, and put all the Xiao Family\u2019s troops inside carts and send them to their barracks! The Xiao family are courageous men, and can naturally be heartless, but we cannot disrespect these heroes who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield!\u201d</p><br/><p>A string of neat commands and a solemn oath from him!</p><br/><p>The soldiers on both sides seemed to quicken their breathing, and their eyes turned red. All gazes turned towards the carts, where limbs could be seen dangling outside of them, spelling utmost bleakness.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang steered his horse back, and a hint of a smile passed through his face. Now that things had gotten to this state, in some way, the plan could have been said to be successful. Since the Ling Family had taken precautions, then his false invasion could be said to be successful. Although the battle got a little out of hand, causing miserable losses, things had settled down at this point. Thus, Xiao FengYang would naturally not bother to bump against this steel wall. It would not be too late to act after Meng RuoYun sent out the news.</p><br/><p>Now that Sky Bearing\u2019s complete attention was placed towards himself, reinforcements would start to be sent from all areas. This would cause a substantial decrease in the number of troops stationed in all other areas, which would definitely aid Meng RuoYun and his group in their operation. Who knows, maybe they could overturn the Ling Family\u2019s nest in one fell swoop?</p><br/><p>While this Second Master Xiao had worked to no avail during this past one day and night, his impatience, anger, and hate had gradually begun to transform into happiness and excitement. The battlefield running out of control was also considered a good thing. Who would have thought that this miserable battle would have resulted in free advertising for him? Most likely, even God could not predict it, let alone the Ling Family!</p><br/><p>Even that little b*st*rd Ling Tian probably would not have imagined that this was the herald to the destruction of Sky Bearing, right?</p><br/><p>Our poor Second Master Xiao was still unaware that the good news he was so eagerly waiting for would never be transmitted to him, and those familiar faces would no longer be seen as well\u2026</p><br/><p>Naturally, along with Second Master Xiao, there was a person whose emotions was just as excited as the latter himself!</p><br/><p>This person was the general of the Ling Family, Yu YanHai! He was also the only person who was clear on Ling Tian\u2019s complete plans!</p><br/><p>Initially, when he saw the overwhelming prestige and aura of the Xiao Family, as well as the mutual destruction wrought by both parties, Yu YanHai\u2019s heart sank. It seemed as though completing his task this time would be a tall order. Since the Xiao Family had sacrificed so much without even getting an inch of land, how could they be satisfied? The following wars would even be more intense, harder to deal with. With the rabble that he was currently leading and the fortifications of the pass completely destroyed, if he had to fight in the open area together with the Xiao Family, just what was their chance of succeeding?</p><br/><p>But never in his dreams did he expect Xiao FengYang to come out and start a tirade! This was really the heavens helping him. He thought to himself, <em>With this old man\u2019s performance, bemoaning the sad fate of the universe, as well as borrowing the corpses of his enemies to set an example, I successfully resolved the state of mutual hostility. This was out of my expectations! Looks like this old man here is really a blessed general.</em></p><br/><p>Looking at the situation now, the task which Young Noble Ling left to him to stall for time could be completed with at least three to five days of guarantee. Hence, while Yu YanHai\u2019s face displayed absolute pain and sadness, his heart was screaming with joy. <em>What was it about the Xiao Family having deep wisdom? What godly general? Weren\u2019t you still completely led around by this old man here?</em></p><br/><p>Just like that, on the battlefield, covered by the fire of war and the thick stench of blood, both parties thought that they had achieved the upper hand, secretly gleeful and happily grinning to themselves\u2026</p><br/><p>However, who was it that would achieve the last laugh?!</p></div>\n</div>"}

The sword in her hand was already pointed towards her abdomen. If Ling Jian died, Xiao YouHan would stab down without the slightest hesitation!</p><br/><p><em>I shall not live alone if the gentleman dies!</em></p><br/><p>Xiao YouHan bit down on her lips as she tightly gripped her sword!</p><br/><p>A loud roar like a dragon sounded and a green shadow shot into the hall. With a few crashing sounds, the experts surrounding Ling Jian were all sent flying like balls with blood spraying out from their mouths!</p><br/><p>Justice had charged in with a face full of depression and anger in his heart!</p><br/><p>After that single sentence of his, Justice did not say anything else. He had been watching from the outside and was waiting for Ling Jian to be unable to hold off his opponents. Justice wanted to see if Ling Jian would plead to him for help. Justice wanted to see if the expressionless face of Ling Jian would change or show any fear at the face of death!</p><br/><p>However, Justice was disappointed!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian did not even let out a single sound. While he knew that a powerful aid was by his side and that Justice could easily jump into the battle and diffuse his situation, Ling Jian did not plead for help!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face remained calm and expressionless. The greater the danger he faced the calmer he was!</p><br/><p>Not to mention seeing anxiousness, in Ling Jian\u2019s eyes, Justice could not see anything but killing intent! Even if he were to be dismembered into countless pieces, Ling Jian would be able to maintain his expression!</p><br/><p>How could Justice not be depressed?</p><br/><p>However, Justice didn\u2019t know that it wasn\u2019t that Ling Jian would never plead for help. However, Ling Jian would only plead to a single person for help in this life of his! That person was Ling Tian! Ling Jian\u2019s life belonged to Ling Tian and it wouldn\u2019t matter if he pleaded to Ling Tian for help!</p><br/><p>In front of Ling Tian, Ling Jian could shed away all of his different faces, be it happiness, anger, grief or fear. But apart from when he was with Ling Tian, Ling Jian would be the proudest person in the world!</p><br/><p>Even if he was the number one expert in the world who Ling Jian respected, in Ling Jian\u2019s heart, Justice didn\u2019t deserve him to plead for his help!</p><br/><p>Was it because Justice didn\u2019t have the right? Not really. It was because Ling Jian would never plead to an outsider for help!</p><br/><p>He was a proud person! He had a proud heart! Ling Jian! He was superior to everyone in the world apart from Ling Tian! He was a sword!</p><br/><p>The sound of fists clashing could be heard and Justice was like a tiger in a herd of sheep displaying his might! In just a short moment, more than ten experts had died under his fists!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is Justice from Beyond Heavens!\u201d someone cried out with fear!</p><br/><p>When facing the First Pavilion Head, the number one assassin in the world, Ling Jian, those from Above Heavens would still have the heart to place their life on the line!</p><br/><p>But when they faced the Martial Order Medallion owner, the number one expert in the world, Justice, any thoughts of fighting back had been destroyed!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s peerless assassination technique truly separated life from death!</p><br/><p>Sect Master of Above Heavens, Meng FanYun: Dead!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian could be proud of this attack of his! This attack was sufficient to shock the world and turn the tides around!</p><br/><p>However, this attack of his had also incited the ferocious counterattack of the Above Heavens experts. The death of Meng FanYun had given these Above Heavens experts who viewed Meng FanYun as a deity a huge blow!</p><br/><p>While Ling Jian was able to take Meng FanYun\u2019s life with a single sword, he was also exhausted and injured. Together with Meng FanYun\u2019s desperate strike before his death, Ling Jian had fallen into a bitter battle!</p><br/><p>This would probably the time of his death!</p><br/><p>However, Justice had appeared at this moment and the Above Heavens experts who were launching a frenzied attack for their revenge were jolted awake!</p><br/><p>This was the effect of his reputation!</p><br/><p>They could remain fearless in the face of the First Pavilion Head and even had the courage to challenge him to take revenge for their Sect Master. However, they were terrified of the number one expert in the world Justice! Ever since Justice failed to kill Ling Tian, his prestige had been on the decline. However, this did not include the members of Above Heavens. Those from Above Heavens were extremely clear that sixteen of their top-notch experts had been single-handedly defeated by Justice when they attempted to surround him! Furthermore, they were defeated in a head-on battle!</p><br/><p>What kind of strength would this require?! Thus, not a single person from Above Heavens was willing or dared to face an invincible opponent like this! They did not even have the guts to put their lives on the line!</p><br/><p>There was the number one assassin in the world! Behind him, the number one expert in the world, Justice, had appeared! That was an opponent that not a single person from Above Heavens would be able to defeat! Furthermore, the pillar of support for Above Heavens had already died!</p><br/><p>How would they be able to continue fighting like this?</p><br/><p>The three white-haired elders tried to stabilize the situation and roared out orders for the crowd to attack. However, the morale of the crowd had already collapsed and there was no turning back. A couple of them were attacking randomly, some were looking around and others already had the intention to escape.</p><br/><p>In truth, if they hadn\u2019t fallen into a mess, Ling Jian was already thoroughly exhausted and Justice would definitely have to be distracted in order to protect Ling Jian. As long as they worked together, they definitely had the ability to put up and fight and Ling Jian would definitely be dragged down with them. However, their morale was already lost and everyone had their own thoughts. How would they be able to work together to surround Justice?</p><br/><p>Ling Jian and Justice weaved about in the crowd and miserable groans could be heard all around. Broken limbs flew in all directions and the smell of blood grew denser and denser in the hall, crushing the courage of the Above Heavens experts even further.</p><br/><p>Seeing their martial brothers and seniors dying a miserable death, with dismembered body parts flying around in all directions, and the large hall where they used to discuss matters being transformed into a river of blood, the extreme fear brought about by the threat of death truly drove them crazy! Finally, one of them could no longer suppress the fear in his heart and threw away his weapon with a crazed roar before running out of the hall.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian tightly gripped his sword and did not bother stopping those who were running. Instead, he became even crueler towards those still present in the hall! With a wave of his arm, Justice sent a white-haired elder flying and sent out a flurry of ferocious attacks at the seven or eight individuals around him.</p><br/><p>With the first abandoning the battle, there would be the second and third\u2026</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the three inner court elders from Above Heavens looked at each other. With their hearts being connected, they let out a roar and their figures shot towards Ling Jian, launching an attack in unison!</p><br/><p>The three of them had been working together for many years and their hearts and thoughts were as one. At this moment, the battle intent of their Above Heavens members had already been crushed and there wasn\u2019t the slightest chance for victory. If they were to fight Justice who was in his best condition, they would only be able to tie him down at the very most and would not have the chance to injure Justice at all. Instead, they might end up being killed by him. On the contrary, the First Pavilion Head was already severely injured after a long period of battle and was obviously exhausted. Since the destruction of their Above Heavens was near, they might as well place their lives on the line. Even if they couldn\u2019t kill Justice, they would kill the First Pavilion Head to take revenge for their Sect Master!</p><br/><p>This attack of theirs combined their lifetime worth of cultivation. Before the attack even arrived, the violent winds from the attack were extremely suffocating. Ling Jian who was severely injured obviously wouldn\u2019t be able to deal with such an attack!</p><br/><p>Justice looked to the side and noticed Ling Jian\u2019s predicament. He immediately let out a crisp cry and was about to charge forward to save Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a familiar voice sounded by Ling Jian\u2019s ears, \u201cWalk towards the entrance of the hall!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian did not even hesitate and made a somersault towards the entrance of the hall.</p><br/><p>Moving from his current position and towards the entrance of the hall would increase the distance between him and Justice. If anything happened, even Justice might not be able to save Ling Jian in time. For Ling Jian who was already thoroughly exhausted to move away from Justice, this was akin to seeking his own death!</p><br/><p>No matter what, charging towards the entrance of the hall was an extremely foolish decision!</p><br/><p>If it was anyone else who instructed him to do so, not only would Ling Jian defy those orders, he might even turn around and give the person a slash instead! The only exception would be the owner of the voice. As long as the owner of this voice gave an order, Ling Jian wouldn\u2019t hesitate even if he had to enter an ocean of blades and a sea of fire!</p><br/><p>The owner of the voice was Ling Tian! Ling Jian could already tell that this voice belonged to Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Jian did not hesitate in the slightest! Even if the entrance of the hall was a mountain of blades and a sea of fire, Ling Jian would not hesitate with those instructions!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brat! Are you crazy? Where are you going?! Are you seeking your death?! Stand there and stop moving, this seat will ensure your safety!\u201d Justice deflected a few blades and was thoroughly enraged when he realized that Ling Jian had moved out of his range of protection! While the morale of the Above Heavens experts had been destroyed, not all were defeated. Justice was still a man and he wasn\u2019t a deity. He wouldn\u2019t be able to do something that was out of a human\u2019s ability!</p><br/><p>Apart from the frightened Above Heavens expert who had escaped, there wasn\u2019t anyone else by the entrance of the hall! With the force of the attack being accumulated, and the entrance being out of Justice\u2019s range, wasn\u2019t Ling Jian seeking death?</p><br/><p>Not to mention Justice being depressed, even the three elders were completely bewildered. To think that Ling Jian would dodge in the wrong direction! Under the lock of their auras, the three of them slashed down with full force!</p><br/><p>This would probably be the last chance for them to take revenge for their Sect Master!</p><br/><p>With Ling Jian\u2019s current strength, it would already be extremely difficult for him to block two swords. However, it would be impossible for him to avoid the third sword.</p><br/><p>If this sword landed, he would be dead for sure!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face was calm and with his sword tilted he received the incoming sword strike calmly. Since his young noble instructed him to come to the entrance, his young noble must have his own intentions! Furthermore, if his young noble was here, it wouldn\u2019t be so easy for him to die.</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Jian was confident that he would be safe!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Jian never imagined that Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t take action!</p><br/><p>The third sword cleaved down towards Ling Jian\u2019s neck with a violent wind!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian felt a tinge of hopelessness in his heart. <em>Why was it like this?</em></p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Ling Jian had not realized that as he retreated towards the entrance, he was already by Xiao YouHan\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Seeing Ling Jian in danger and his life at risk, Xiao YouHan did not know where her courage came from. Ignoring her weak strength, she lifted up her sword and with a gentle moan, sparks flew in all directions. Her body was suddenly filled with strength and she had actually blocked the might of the sword before it reached Ling Jian\u2019s neck!</p></div>\n</div>"}

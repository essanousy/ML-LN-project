Looking at the fatigued appearance of her beloved man before her, Yu BingYan was filled with heartache, happiness, and pride in her heart. She could not help but dive into Ling Tian\u2019s almost naked embrace and her tears began to wet Ling Tian\u2019s naked chest.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian hugged the delicate figure in his embrace and was filled with joy. BingYan was finally healed!</p><br/><p>A short while later, Yu BingYan finally calmed herself down from her agitation and could immediately feel the intense cold in the chamber. She could not help but shiver slightly as she looked around with shock. Seeing the mist all around the chamber, ice on the ground and four gigantic slabs of ice in the corners of the chamber, her eyes widened in shock and her jaw dropped. \u201cTian\u2019ge\u2026 all\u2026 all of this is a result of the frost toxins in my body? Isn\u2019t it too\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian nodded his head with a smile. Yu BingYan\u2019s eyes widened even further and she almost fainted from the shock. She had never imagined that the frost toxins in her body would be so terrifying! Furthermore, it laid dormant in her body for so many years!</p><br/><p>Seeing Yu BingYan\u2019s eyes widen, Ling Tian knew that Yu BingYan must have suffered from quite a bit of shock and could not help but laugh.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan turned around and looked at the fatigued Ling Chen and Li Xue. She could not help but say with guilt, \u201cIt is truly all thanks to these two elder sisters. Because of me, the two of them were actually exhausted to such a point. I\u2026 I really do not know how to thank them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled and said, \u201cWe are one big family and there is no need to say thanks. If you were in their shoes, I believe that you would also help them unconditionally as well. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking for a moment, Yu BingYan nodded her head heavily.</p><br/><p>As he was talking, Ling Tian\u2019s attention was focused on Li Xue. With the whole poison purging process nearing its end, he, Ling Chen, and Yu BingYan were already safe but the only one who wasn\u2019t completely in the clear was Li Xue.</p><br/><p>Li Xue was truly the number one contributor to purge the Divine Black Negative Meridians. With her weak female physique, it was truly a difficult matter for her to hold on until now.</p><br/><p>Looking at her carefully, Ling Tian frowned at a strange scene. Ling Tian had previously reminded Li Xue to put down her left hand but her left hand was currently still placed out in front of her chest and had not moved an inch. After Ling Tian looked at her for a while more, he finally understood what was going on and could not help but feel respect for Li Xue.</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s left hand was not like his or Ling Chen\u2019s hands. Their hands had rested on another individual and while this was tiring, they weren\u2019t suspended in mid-air. However, Li Xue\u2019s palm was suspended in mid-air and she had to keep it there for a full three days and nights! Just what kind of a mental strength did she need?!</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Tian immediately knew that it wasn\u2019t that Li Xue didn\u2019t want to put her hand down but that it was frozen there. If not for the fact that Li Xue cultivated the pure Yin Divine Ice Formula, she would have to keep her arm in that position for life! But even so, it would take a period of time before Li Xue would be back at her peak condition.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt a sense of warmth in his heart. He then circulated his remaining pure Yang inner qi in his palm and rubbed his palms together in order to generate warmth. After his palms were warmed up properly, Ling Tian then walked over and held onto Li Xue\u2019s left arm. While he had already prepared himself mentally, he was still shocked. Li Xue\u2019s arm was even colder than a slab of ice! With the familiarity he had with the Divine Ice Formula, he massaged Li Xue starting with her shoulder and slowly making his way into her arm. His warm inner qi was injected into Li Xue\u2019s body and her frozen muscles and meridians were slowly nourished. After her skin finally regained its softness, Ling Tian placed Li Xue\u2019s left hand back on her knees.</p><br/><p>A look of comfort could be obviously seen on Li Xue\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s actions were extremely gentle and his inner qi was only limited to Li Xue\u2019s shoulder and arm. He did not affect Li Xue in the slightest or disturb her from circulating her qi, but used the best way to ease her fatigue.</p><br/><p>Just like what Ling Tian had guessed, Li Xue\u2019s left arm had maintained this position for a full three days and nights and was already in a frozen state. In fact, her arm was beginning to cramp up already. However, Li Xue was currently refining the last bit of frosty qi in her body and despite being in discomfort, she had no choice but to leave her arm suspended. If she tried to forcefully lower her arm, it would only damage her bones and tendons. If Ling Tian didn\u2019t help her resolve this issue, she would probably have to wait until the whole event was completed before she could tend to it.</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s arm was alright but Ling Tian had used his last bit of pure Yang inner qi to massage Li Xue\u2019s arm and his vitality was truly harmed. After today, he would probably require a few days to adjust his condition back to normal.</p><br/><p>After making sure that Li Xue didn\u2019t have any hidden injuries, Ling Tian smiled and heaved a sigh of relief. He then picked Yu BingYan\u2019s petite figure up and said, \u201cIt\u2019s best we go out first and allow the two of them to absorb the frosty qi in this place. Let us go and have a meal and put on some clothes. It has been a full three days and nights and I am starving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan let out a gasp of shock and realized that she was completely naked. Her face flushed completely red and she covered her proud twin peaks with her hands while saying shyly, \u201cYou\u2026 we\u2026 we should wait for the two elder sisters first\u2026 and\u2026 and go out with them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cThere really isn\u2019t a need to do so. Who knows how long they will take to absorb all of the frosty qi in this place? This environment is a cultivation heaven for them but isn\u2019t good for us, especially since you just recovered from your injuries. Besides that, we also have to prepare something to eat for the two of them, otherwise your two elder sisters will be starved to the point they become mummies.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan leaned in Ling Tian\u2019s embrace and allowed him to carry her out while asking, \u201cWhat are mummies?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After guarding the place bitterly for a full three days and nights, Ling Jian finally heard Ling Tian\u2019s voice again. Ling Jian who was extremely tempted to charge into the chamber was elated! After hearing what Ling Tian needed, he quickly ran out to instruct his subordinates to prepare it.</p><br/><p>Mmm, clothes, blankets, undergarments, shoes, and most importantly, food. Ling Tian especially ordered for porridge to be sent over and Ling Jian could understand why.</p><br/><p>After not eating for three days and nights, if he didn\u2019t eat some porridge to warm up his stomach and started off with meat instead, his stomach would definitely be extremely uncomfortable. This was true even though Ling Tian\u2019s stomach was far stronger than an ordinary individual after the many years of inner qi training.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was extremely efficient, and everything Ling Tian wanted was sent over in less than 15 minutes.</p><br/><p>Even after finishing her meal, Yu BingYan, who was wrapped in a thick fur coat, still did not dare to raise her head. She still had not forgotten that Ling Tian had carried a completely naked her out from the chamber and she was still extremely embarrassed. While the one who saw her body was her beloved man and her husband, Yu BingYan still felt an extremely strange feeling. She was filled with a sense of sweetness and shyness at the same time\u2026</p><br/><p>After having their meal, Ling Tian first instructed Ling Jian to take Yu BingYan to rest before he headed back into the chamber with a lunch box in his hands.</p><br/><p>Thinking about how Yu BingYan was shy to the point she did not even dare look at him and looked as though her head was about to be retracted into her body, Ling Tian could not help but giggle. This lass\u2026 mmm, she has finally grown up\u2026</p><br/><p>Pick the flowers when they are on the branch, don\u2019t wait until the branches are empty before attempting to pick the flowers. Ling Tian suddenly thought about a poem from his previous life and a bright smile could be seen on his face.</p><br/><p>After not eating for three days and night, even a normal bowl of porridge was extremely fragrant.</p><br/><p>When Ling Tian walked into the secret chamber again, Ling Chen and Li Xue were both anxiously in cultivation. The layers of cloth that were hung up around them were already frozen into rigid slabs. However, the mist in the chamber was already far thinner. Ling Tian could visibly see the mist being absorbed into Ling Chen\u2019s body before being sent to Li Xue\u2019s body. After Li Xue refined it once, it would be sent back into Ling Chen\u2019s body and this pattern continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of them are truly cultivation freaks.\u201d Ling Tian rubbed his chin and admired the two exquisite figures before him. His abdomen immediately began burning up and little young noble Ling was about to lift its head\u2026</p><br/><p>Even after three days and nights of purging poison, the two of them still had the strength to cultivate! Did they not want to continue living? Aren\u2019t they a little too crazy! Ling Tian grumbled in his heart. He naturally knew that there wouldn\u2019t be any issue if the two of them were to stop now but the frosty qi in the chamber would disperse after a while. This frosty qi was a pure XianTian qi and it was no wonder that the two ladies couldn\u2019t bear to let it go to waste. They would rather starve themselves and force their fatigued bodies to continue absorbing the frosty qi.</p><br/><p>While their bodies would be able to hold up, Ling Tian felt his heart aching. While raising their strength was important, it shouldn\u2019t be done in such a manner right? They still had the Great Cyclic Pellet and flood dragon inner pellet. Was there really a need to strive so hard for this little bit of frosty XianTian qi?</p><br/><p>Walking back into the chamber, Ling Tian first brought out the piping hot dishes. He then placed it under Ling Chen\u2019s nose before placing it under Li Xue\u2019s nose for her to sniff the fragrance of the meal. The expression of the two cultivation maniacs changed slightly as their noses twitched. Following which, their tummies began grumbling\u2026</p><br/><p>A naughty smile could be seen on Ling Tian\u2019s face. This is probably the best way for him to disrupt the two ladies cultivation right?</p><br/><p>The next moment, Ling Chen and Li Xue opened their eyes together and the same look could be seen in both of their eyes: Frustration and helplessness.</p><br/><p>Following which, the two ladies were woken up by their rumbling tummies and their hunger assaulted them like a raging tsunami. Looking around, they immediately noticed the delicacies before their eyes and their eyes lit up brightly. They no longer had the ability to resist their hunger and could not be bothered to reprimand Ling Tian either. Their palms which were joined together separated as they wolfed down their meal.</p></div>\n</div>"}

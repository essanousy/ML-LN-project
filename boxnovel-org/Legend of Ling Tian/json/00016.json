Ling Zhen was also in the crowd, leaning onto someone. The moment Ling Tian entered, he looked over and was certain that he was that person: the person who revealed a killing intent to him when he was born! Now, Ling Tian knew that he was called Ling Kong.</p><br/><p>After he knew that Ling Zhen was Ling Kong\u2019s son and Ling Kong was the only godson of his grandfather, Ling Tian understood the source of his killing intent. His father was the only successor of the Ling family but did not have a child after so many years of marriage. If this situation were to persist, then the only successor from the third generation would be Ling Kong\u2019s son, Ling Zhen! Ever since Ling Tian was born, he had completely destroyed the dreams of that father and son pair! Thus, they were naturally extremely hateful towards Ling Tian\u2026</p><br/><p>As he thought about that, Ling Tian began to feel pity towards this father and son pair. He would also not be able to take such a blow if it happened to him. Wait a moment\u2026 Ling Tian suddenly thought about something. My father and mother are extremely loving and the both of them are extremely normal. Why would they not have a child after so many years of marriage? Don\u2019t tell me that is a conspiracy of Ling Kong all this while?!</p><br/><p>A chilly gaze flashed past Ling Tian\u2019s eyes. If that is really the case, this Ling Kong deserves to die!</p><br/><p>Ever since Ling Tian entered the room, Ling Kong and Ling Zhen\u2019s eyes became agitated as a deep hatred hid beneath their eyes.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian twitched his lips, paid his greetings to his grandfather and ran forward. Ling Zhan immediately lit up as a bright smile filled his face, hugging Ling Tian in his bosom.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I have not seen little young master for a few years and he has grown up to be so big already. He looks exactly like elder brother. Hahaha\u2026\u201d A caring sounding laughter sounded. Without looking back, Ling Tian knew that the laughter must have definitely came from Ling Kong.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao and his wife paid their greetings to everyone present and sat down. Ling Zhan then became serious as he said to Ling Xiao and Chu Ting\u2019er, \u201cTian\u2019er has grown up already and it is time for him to learn the six arts of a gentleman [1] and poetry so he can have a future for himself. I can\u2019t possibly allow people to say that the grandson of I, Ling Zhan, is just a useless, incompetent and ignorant brat. Mmm, today, I have invited all of the famous scholars within the capital. If the both of you do not have any opinions, they will stay in the mansion from today to teach Tian\u2019er.\u201d As Ling Zhan said that, he looked towards Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao laughed bitterly, thinking: You have already arranged everything and chosen everyone. What disagreements can we have? He definitely has hidden intentions behind his words. What does he mean by useless, incompetent and ignorant brat? He is probably still angry at me because of the \u2018one-year-old catch\u2019 incident. Ling Xiao did not dare disagree and said, \u201cFather, you can just make the arrangements which you deem appropriate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er sat down with her brows furrowed. As she heard what Ling Zhan said, she could not help but be angry. This old man, how can you talk about your own grandson like that? My son is only five, in what way is he incompetent?</p><br/><p>Ling Zhan then hugged Ling Tian and said with a smile, \u201cGood grandson, take a look, grandfather has specially searched for all these teachers for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian almost fainted as he pointed at the crowd asking in disbelief, \u201cAll of these people are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Zhan then said with a smile, \u201cTake a look, this is Mister Qin who will teach you poetry. Mister Qin is a righteous and knowledgeable man, and is a good teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mister Qin was dressed in a scholarly robe with a lean appearance and skinny figure. He then twiddled with his beard and nodded with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Master Lu who will teach you archery and horse-riding. Master Lu is extremely familiar with archery and horse-riding. A few years ago, he was the instructor for the imperial guards. Many high-ranking officials in the military were taught by Master Lu; it can be said that he has many talented disciples.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Master Shang who will teach you music. Master Shang has a profound understanding towards music, especially the zither, and is the number one musician in the palace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Master He who will also teach you music. Master He is renowned for his skills with the side-blowing and end-blowing flute. All of the music fanatics in the world today would definitely be honored to listen to Master He\u2019s performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Master Hou who will teach you drawing\u2026\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s eyes grew wider.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will teach you calligraphy\u2026\u201d Ling Tian rolled his eyes and almost fainted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will teach you etiquette\u2026\u201d Ling Tian, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will teach you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>*Crash*</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s eyes turned white as he fainted on the ground, his whole body trembling\u2026</p><br/><p>With the threat of refusing to eat, Ling Xiao and Chu Ting\u2019er began to plead for their son out of heartache. Together with the scolding of old madam Ling, Ling Zhan finally changed his mind, retaining only a few teachers and sending the rest back.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Zhan only took a small step back. Ling Zhan seriously declared that even if Ling Tian wasn\u2019t going to learn them, he would have to understand them at the very least. Poetry, horse-riding and archery were compulsory lessons for him. Chess, zither, calligraphy and painting were secondary lessons. As for the rest, he would also have to choose some of them\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was depressed!</p><br/><p>This daddy here is able to be the all-rounded teacher of all these people! Not only in the areas of poetry, chess, music and calligraphy, but also in the 18 Chinese weapons together with both internal and external martial arts! For those who are even more interested, I can even teach them some Chemistry or even English, Japanese, German, Spanish and Portuguese\u2026</p><br/><p>With an extremely bad mood, Ling Zhen, who was someone whom he did not already like, became the target for him to vent his anger.</p><br/><p>After the ceremony of apprenticeship, Ling Kong suggested allowing Ling Zhen to study with Ling Tian to keep him company as well, obtaining the approval of Ling Zhan, Ling Xiao and his wife immediately. As for Ling Tian, he would naturally not have an issue against it. Who wouldn\u2019t like a toy for him to exploit his intelligence! As such, Ling Zhen became Ling Tian\u2019s study attendant under the insistence of Ling Kong.</p><br/><p>Originally, Ling Tian felt extremely amused when he saw the fictitious smile on Ling Zhen\u2019s face. But when he was in an extremely bad mood and Ling Zhen revealed a fake smile again, it got him a kick from Ling Tian, \u201cWhat are you laughing at? Get out of here if you continue laughing!\u201d</p><br/><p>What a joke! Perhaps it can be said that it is extremely rare for someone your age to be so scheming. Maybe it may be more interesting for me to play with you in a few years\u2019 time. But with your little intellect, you want to try hiding the sword with your smile? Aren\u2019t you just seeking death?</p><br/><p>Being caught off guard and having a foot to his face, Ling Zhen\u2019s nose began to bleed and he did not react in time. Only after a while did he began to burst out into tears.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then scolded fiercely, \u201cWhat are you crying for? Didn\u2019t I just kick you once? You\u2019re crying so badly because of that? Cheh!\u201d He pointed a middle finger with disdain.</p><br/><p>Mister Qin, who was reciting a poem while shaking his head, never expected that this little young master who looked as pretty as a girl would be so vicious. In a blink of an eye, another student was already lying on the floor with a face full of blood! At that moment, Mister Qin\u2019s tongue was left hanging as he trembled from anger. He pointed at Ling Tian with his finger trembling, completely unable to say anything, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then rolled his eyes and said, \u201cWhat about me? This young master here is educating my study attendant. Do you have an opinion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mister Qin\u2019s finger continued to tremble as he twitched in anger, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 will anger this old man to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian snickered and kicked Ling Zhen in his abdomen, \u201cGet up, are you pretending to be dead like a dog? This young master is telling you now. When I am not happy, you are not allowed to smile. When this young master is happy, you will have to laugh happily even if your leg is broken! Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Zhen cried out in pain as he wiggled to get up. With a vicious look on his face, he scolded, \u201cSon of a bitch! You dare to hit me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? F**K! You have balls! You dare to scold me?\u201d Hahaha, I just want you to scold me. If you don\u2019t scold me, I won\u2019t be able to continue hitting you! But these words of yours have completely enraged me! This brat, both him and his grandfather does not hold our family in any regard!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then rushed forward using both his arms and feet. Although Ling Zhen was older than him by three years, Ling Tian was extremely agile. If he were to use inner Qi, he would probably be able to kill Ling Zhen with a single fist. The next instant, Ling Zhen lay on the floor like a dead fish, bruises all over his body!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis child cannot be taught!\u201d Seeing how it was useless to stop the fight, Mister Qin\u2019s face turned ashen as he lifted up the ruler in his hands and shouted, \u201cKneel down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor what? Kneel down for what? This young master has only taught my study attendant a lesson. Who asked him to smile when I\u2019m in a bad mood? Don\u2019t tell me it is wrong for me to teach my subordinate a lesson? Now I have to be punished?\u201d Ling Tian said with force. What a joke! That pair of father and son wants to harm me even in their dreams. Of course there is nothing wrong for this young master to collect some interest first!</p><br/><p>Dammit, to let me study Confucius with him here is a complete joke! If I don\u2019t drive you away from anger, how will my plan succeed? Besides, if I were to really learn properly, won\u2019t that make the Yang family and Imperial family deal with us prematurely?</p><br/><p>This daddy has already been obedient for five years; it is time for me to be hedonistic for once!</p><br/><p>[1]: The six arts refer to: rites, music, archery, charioteering, calligraphy and mathematics.</p>\n</div>"}

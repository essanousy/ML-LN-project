Looking at her, this lass would probably not pass sixteen years of age. And she even dared to say that she had not killed for sixteen years?! What frightening speech!</p><br/><p>As though she discovered a problem with what she said, Li Xue showed some panic before covering up, \u201cMy meaning was, in this life I\u2019ve lived for sixteen years, but have not killed anyone yet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis life?\u201d Ling Tian asked a little suspiciously. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve lived for more than one life?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d A lovable smile appeared on Li Xue\u2019s face, and she suddenly accelerated in front of him as she replied, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t pass through the samsara of life and death? I\u2019ve already lived for several lives, maybe tens or even hundreds of lives. That\u2019s a perfectly normal matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing that he had been duped again, Ling Tian gazed at the graceful body in front of him, not knowing whether to laugh or to cry. He had the sudden urge to catch up to her and thoroughly spank those two little butt cheeks of hers! But, thinking twice, Ling Tian questioned whether he who was fearless would actually dare to slight this slim lass in front of him! This person\u2026 seemed to be someone who could not be provoked.</p><br/><p>NanGong TianLong walked with a dejected expression on the mountain road. While his injuries were not serious, he had suffered a major loss in face being slapped in front of all those major powers by Justice! And this was given the fact that the NanGong Family had barely any face left!</p><br/><p>The teeth in his mouth had almost all fallen out, causing his voice to sound extremely strange. As such, NanGong TianLong decided that it was better for him not to speak a single word. However, the constant gleam in his eyes betrayed his desire for revenge! But thinking about it, their family could not even deal with a single Ling Tian, so where would they have the chance to talk about handling the number one expert? He could not help but feel dismayed at this.</p><br/><p>The bodyguard beside him naturally knew what he was so depressed about and softly spoke, \u201cFamily Head need not feel grieved, that person was the Martial Order Medallion owner after all, the publicly acclaimed number one expert. Losing to him in one exchange is definitely not something to be ashamed about. Furthermore, Family Head has managed to come out in one piece after exchanging moves with him, that should be something to be proud of. If we were to ask the pugilistic world, just how many people could say that they are able to walk away in one piece after challenging the Martial Order Medallion owner?\u201d</p><br/><p>TianLong let out a depressed grunt, his face totally red in embarrassment. What thing of retreating in one piece from the other party\u2019s hands? The person just could not be bothered to kill him, that was all! However, this consolation made his heart feel a lot better, and he could actually just hypnotize himself to believe this path of thought. He let out a frustrated breath, before hatefully saying, \u201cLing Tian got off too cheaply!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToo cheaply? I\u2019m not at any advantage! Haha, haven\u2019t I already come up to you? Have you been good so far, Family Head NanGong! Oh, your appearance looks like you\u2019re not in good shape, can you still speak coherently?\u201d A voice filled with iciness and killing intent suddenly sounded above his head, followed by two sounds of agonized wails as the last two members of his family\u2019s experts suddenly fell onto the ground, their necks twisted at an unnatural angle.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian bore a smile on his face as he slowly revealed himself. Walking step by step over, his white robes fluttered with the wind. He seemed like a long-lost friend who had just met his bosom buddy once again, the expression on his face appearing like he was in extreme joy.</p><br/><p>Beside him, one of the NanGong Family guards yelled as he viciously brought his blade down on him!</p><br/><p>\u201cToo rude!\u201d Ling Tian chastized as he waved his sleeve without even turning his head. He easily caught that guard\u2019s wrist and applying a bit of force caused the latter\u2019s blade to fall out of his hands. A little bit more force and a snapping and tearing sound was heard before the guard\u2019s entire arm was almost torn off my Ling Tian. Fresh blood spouted, along with the appearance of some white jagged pieces of bone that could be seen.</p><br/><p>The intense pain only allowed that guard to let out a scream of misery before he passed out. Even in his unconscious state, his body continued to twitch. One could imagine how much misery he was undergoing!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian grasped that broken arm with one hand, dragging the guard as he warmly smiled while walking towards NanGong TianLong. \u201cFamily Head NanGong, we\u2019ve only not met for a while, and the entire Universe seems to have reversed. To the point that even my ally the NanGong Family has chosen to hunt me down. This really makes Ling Tian sigh in regret, that things are never constant in this world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian!\u201d NanGong TianLong suffered from a huge shock. Due to more than half of his teeth being knocked out, he could only manage a vague interpretation of the two words, and they came out sounding like a leaky tap!</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head NanGong, my good alliance friend, you really have a good memory. To think that you still can remember who I am!\u201d Ling Tian let out an unrestrained smile as he politely replied. \u201cA pity that no matter how good your memory is, you failed to remember that what I, Ling Tian, hate the most is betrayal. And you just so happened to have touched my greatest taboo.\u201d A resigned sigh came out from Ling Tian\u2019 mouth. \u201cI really feel sorry for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong TianLong\u2019s body began to tremble violently, as he slowly stepped back, his face dyed a pale white, \u201cLing Tian\u2026., you, what do you want? There are numerous experts from the various families here and all of them want your life. If I were you, I would immediately escape, or else this will be your burial ground!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks to family head for thinking about me even at this critical juncture, but I\u2019ve never placed any of them in my eyes at all. Besides, didn\u2019t you just ask me what I wanted to do?\u201d Ling Tian blandly smiled as he shook the arm that he was carrying. This movement caused that unlucky guard to awaken from his unconscious state due to the pain he had received, letting out another strangled scream as he bore with the pain. Large beads of sweat trickled down his entire body, as it uncontrollably trembled, to the point that the guard could not even voice out the word \u2018pain\u2019\u2026</p><br/><p>What a bloody method, what a cruel person!</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think of doing anything, but just wanted to know what Family Head NanGong wanted to do. Rest assured, just based on your previous caring thought for me, I\u2019ll not let you suffer any hardship!\u201d Ling Tian blandly spoke, and suddenly his face turned ferocious, \u201cI can tell you right now, that your actions today have thoroughly broken my bottom line! I\u2019ve decided that, in this heaven and earth, your NanGong family can now cease to exist!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can leave in peace. On the road to the yellow springs, you won\u2019t be lonely for too long! Definitely not!\u201d Ling Tian cackled as his right hand jerked, tearing off the last tendons that were left keeping the broken arm of the guard attached. He then wielded it as a weapon, as he rushed towards NanGong TianLong, slapping it down!</p><br/><p>NanGong TianLong let out a mad shout. At this life and death juncture, he gathered all his strength under the pressure and let out the strongest strike he could muster!</p><br/><p>A pity that his abdomen suddenly felt a sharp pain. As it turns out, he had unexpectedly received a vicious kick from Ling Tian! His tall and sturdy body was kicked upward and fell almost five feet away! When his sword sheath at his waist fell onto the ground, it even let out a clean cracking sound!</p><br/><p>This family head of the NanGong family, the successors of the \u2018Sword God Manual\u2019, had in his panic forgot to draw his treasured sword! He had totally forgotten to use his most proficient martial arts to go against the enemy! This was evidence of how much pressure Ling Tian gave him.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a cold smile as he slowly walked towards where NanGong TianLong lay.</p><br/><p>From his surroundings came sounds of shock and dismay, and seven or eight shadows suddenly rushed up and away, fleeing in different directions without any regard whatsoever!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian acted as if he did not see that scene, his eyelids not even batting.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, shrill sounds rang out as the eight sturdy shadows fell down at almost the same time. They uniformly turned into meat piles, blood leaking out of their mouths. It was as though they had tripped and fallen, but all eight of them had already stopped breathing!</p><br/><p>In one blow, eight of them immediately lost their lives!</p><br/><p>What sort of penetrative martial art was that? And what sort of frightening killer could do this?!</p><br/><p>A light blue colored figure which showcased its endless elegance slowly drifted into the scene like a dream becoming reality. Li Xue slowly drew a white cloth from her bosom before using it to wipe her hands that she had used to kill the eight people a while ago. This action was as though she had just finished her meal. Then, that piece of white cloth fluttered out of her hands, following the wind to come to rest on a high branch! This scene was as though she was offering her condolences to the once grand and majestic NanGong family!</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s indifferent eyes roved over the remaining four experts from the NanGong family, causing them to stiffen up. A fearful glance appeared in their eyes as they felt their legs turn to jelly, causing them to kneel down on the floor with pitiful expressions.</p><br/><p>A hint of disdain appeared on Li Xue\u2019s face as she turned her gaze back onto Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>NanGong TianLong was breathing laboriously as he tried to get up, his face filled with endless remorse! That\u2019s right, he regretted everything. If he had honestly and quietly remained at Gold Jade City, then he would still be the high and mighty head of the NanGong Family! Furthermore, there would still be the tag of Ling Tian\u2019s only alliance mate on his head, and if Ling Tian were to really manage to escape, then he would definitely show kindness to the people in his alliance! Not only would he not kill them off, but he would even make sure that the NanGong Family retained their power, and increasing their prestige and influence was also not impossible!</p><br/><p>Even if Ling Tian could not escape from the pursuit of Justice, what did it matter to him? Could he have obtained another sort of benefit from joining in? What his NanGong Family needed most was to bide their time, and recoup their strength, waiting for the future!</p><br/><p>However, it was his obsession that led him to here, wanting to see the miserable face of Ling Tian and let out that breath of frustration on his chest! This was simply looking for trouble!</p><br/><p>The NanGong Family would never have any future to speak about!</p><br/><p>At this point, NanGong TianLong truly regretted his actions, but what a pity that his regret came a little bit late!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian slowly bent down, his eyes shooting out a callous and cruel gaze as his pale hand decisively closed around NanGong TianLong\u2019s throat. Under the latter\u2019s pleading and pitiful gaze, he slowly tightened his grip!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

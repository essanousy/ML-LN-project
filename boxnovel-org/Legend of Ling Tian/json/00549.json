With a \u2018pa\u2019 sound, the two palms met. Ling Tian only felt a soft and smooth feeling, as though he had come into contact with flawless jade, and could not help but shake in his heart. In that instant, he felt as though he did not want to retract his hand. As for Shui QianRou, her pair of eyes were fixed on Ling Tian\u2019s face, with a dreamy look on her face that was hard to comprehend, and she too forgot to take her hand back.</p><br/><p>It was after a long while that Shui QianRou suddenly withdrew her hand at lightning speed. She placed her hand within her bosom and turned around, but Ling Tian saw that her eyes were already red, and there were obvious signs of unshed tears.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian pretended to let out an easy laugh as he stood up, saying, \u201cAfter a while I\u2019ll get someone to send you back, and secretly send Shui QianHu and his group to your hands. You\u2019ll be able to take revenge for your brother then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her body trembled at Ling Tian\u2019s words, and she clenched her teeth as she spat her words out, \u201cI will, oh I definitely will.\u201d Her voice was full of fury and hate as well as an irrevocable determination.</p><br/><p>Looking at this rare side of her, Ling Tian lightly sighed before heavily saying, \u201cWhile I don\u2019t wish to nag so much, I still have to say this. For those three, it would be good to just kill Shui QianHu, and leave the other two until two and a half years later before killing them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Shui QianRou emotionally turned around. \u201cThose three jerks were involved in the death of my brother, and I hate that I cannot reduce them to a thousand pieces! While Shui QianHu is the main culprit and must be killed, the other two are also accomplices, not at all inferior to that b<em>st</em>rd. Why do I have to wait for another two and a half years? I\u2019ll definitely kill them to avenge my brother. My brother wants to live but has no way to, and I must make sure that his enemies all die in front of him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s tone was frosty, even causing Ling Tian to shiver with the cold. He did not dare to let her know that the Ling Family actually played a part in scheming for her brother\u2019s death, or else that could be their calamity in the future!</p><br/><p>A radiant light shone across his pupils as Ling Tian insisted, \u201cNot only must you let the two of them go, you must also keep the fact that your brother has died from the people back in Heavenly Wind! All of this must wait until two and a half years later!\u201d Ling Tian coldly stared at her, \u201cIf you do not wish for the Shui Family to perish in the short term, then it would be best you did as you\u2019re told. The decision lies in your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou was naturally not someone without brains and was merely pushed by her emotions due to her blood brother dying. Having been awoken by Ling Tian\u2019s cold harsh reality, she immediately understood what Ling Tian was trying to say. \u201cYou mean\u2026 the generational battle?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian nodded in response, \u201cThat\u2019s right, in another two and a half years it will be the destined battle between the Yu and Shui Families. Right now, if you kill all of them and send news of your brother\u2019s death, the killers of one\u2019s sons cannot share the same heaven, and your father, as well as your uncles, will not be able to take it! The Shui Family already has no buffer for any internal affairs, and the bloodbath will immediately start. Regardless of who wins or loses, the Shui Family will lose a great deal of its strength. When the generational battle then starts, how many people will you all be able to gather? At that time, the Yu Family with its prestige rising to the stars will never let you go! Even if you have my help, it will be to no avail. As such, the cleansing of the Shui Family will have to wait until the generational battles end before it can officially proceed.\u201d Ling Tian stared straight at her. \u201cThe generational battle is also your best bet currently.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou, however, shook her head sadly. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that\u2019s not possible anymore. Everybody is aware that my brother\u2019s injuries are incurable, and I\u2019m afraid the entire Family already knows of this matter. Even if I wanted to, I couldn\u2019t hide it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 in that case\u2026\u201d Ling Tian breathed deeply as he took two steps before his eyebrows suddenly raised up. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then tell your family that although your esteemed brother\u2019s injuries were life-threatening, you paid a huge price and managed to move Justice from the Beyond Heavens sect to use his peerless medical craft to treat your brother. While he managed to save his life, due to the threat, he will have to be quarantined for the time being within Beyond Heavens until he passes the danger phase. As for the perpetrator Shui QianHu, after taking revenge, then I\u2019ll arrange for him to be thrown into the Azure Pavilion, creating a scene where he went mad and died due to jealousy. While there might be suspicions, but without proof, no one would do anything, and you can drag this on indefinitely. How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s eyes gleamed, \u201cWhile this may be able to confuse and mislead everyone, I\u2019m just afraid\u2026\u201d A hurt look crossed her face, \u201cThat brother\u2019s death will already be a great shock to father, and with us hiding the truth, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be afraid of. There\u2019s a type of lie called benevolence. Besides, you\u2019re doing so because you have no choice. I\u2019m sure that if your father knew about this, he would not blame you for your choices.\u201d Ling Tian seriously spoke. \u201cEven if your father finds out that your brother had already passed away two years ago, without the usual morning and evening visits, he would also gradually have gotten used to it. By that time, when he sees how outstanding you are, grasping hold of the Shui Family as well as avenging your brother, his hurt would also be lessened. However, if you were to pass on the message of death now, this sort of impact is not something everyone can bear.\u201d</p><br/><p>With Ling Tian\u2019s meticulous planning, Shui QianRou finally relaxed. However, a thought flashed through her mind and she blurted out, \u201cYoung Noble Ling, you mentioned just now that Justice is a peerless physician. Is that true? Isn\u2019t he the Martial Order Medallion owner, the strongest martial expert on earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Justice guy is a talent that defies whatever this world stands for, his knowledge is unimaginable. From medicine to astrology, cultural and military strategies, there\u2019s not one that he isn\u2019t a master of. Actually, you are also connected to him by some sort of destiny. That day, the one who forked out fifty taels of silver to buy the Red Sandalwood Pearl from the Southern Sea was him!\u201d Ling Tian looked at her in a strange manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed, I thought so. He slaughtered over a hundred of my men with one person\u2019s strength, and to turn out that his motive was really to obtain the Red Sandalwood Pearl. If not for him, how would both my uncles die such a miserable death?!\u201d Shui QianRou spat with hate. If it wasn\u2019t for Justice\u2019s wanton killing that day, both brother and sister wouldn\u2019t have landed in such a state today. It was natural for Shui QianRou to hate him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh Great Miss Shui, I have to give you a piece of advice. Give up any thoughts of revenge, Justice\u2019s cultivation, martial skills, and movement techniques are already nearing the pinnacle, each without a match, or else why would I have to hide from him for a year! Since we\u2019re both allies, I have to caution you!\u201d Ling Tian stated, \u201cThis sort of mentality to seek revenge would only cause more needless sacrifices.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not believe that nobody can overtake someone their entire life! My Family\u2019s elder, Shui WuPo, has an innate talent for martial arts and is a peerless expert of his generation. He was able to match blows with the pinnacle expert of Heavenly Star, the \u2018Fantasy Universe\u2019 Xu RuoMeng! Maybe I can move him to seek revenge!\u201d Shui QianRou seemed to have the utmost confidence in her elder.</p><br/><p>This was greeted by a sarcastic smile from Ling Tian, \u201cTo be able to fight evenly with Xu RuoMeng, is it a big deal?! You know that he comes from one of the three Great Sects, the direct line of descent under the Above Heavens Sect founded Meng RuoXu, but did you know that the same Xu RuoMeng died under the hands of Justice?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s such a thing?!\u201d Shui QianRou\u2019s face paled. \u201cTo think that such an expert existed in the world!\u201d Then a look of joy appeared on her face. \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then with his knowledge, maybe he could really heal my brother, or maybe he can even save him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian did not know whether to laugh or to cry. Women were really a strange breed of creatures, the first moment thinking of revenge, the second suddenly wanting their enemy to save their loved ones. He could only helplessly reply her, \u201cYour brother could only survive until now because of Chen\u2019er\u2019s Divine Ice Formula, placing most of his body under cryostasis. While it slows down his rate of death, it\u2019s actually burning up all of his life! Furthermore, it is easy for Justice to find you, but do you think it\u2019s easy to do the opposite? What\u2019s more, you don\u2019t even possess a martial order medallion for him to take action! Lastly, Justice\u2019s medical skills might be miraculous, but he is after all a man, not a god. Your brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou only stood here for a long time, before finally sighing and lowly speaking, \u201cAt this time, this is also the best choice.\u201d While her voice was low, it struck heavily in Ling Tian\u2019s ears like a lofty mountain. It had taken her so long to finally discover a chance to save her brother, but it was burned almost immediately. Who would be able to take it?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian no longer spoke, instead standing up and beginning to walk outside. Before he reached the doorstep, he heard her softly whisper to herself, in a voice that was barely perceptible, \u201cLing Tian, this time, even if you didn\u2019t give me any benefits, I would still have agreed. I don\u2019t know if you have any other sort of ideas, but this time, I have chosen to throw all my trust towards you. It might be because I do not have any path of retreat left, but to leave such a matter towards someone who is my opponent, my enemy, it is still a first for me. I hope that you will not disappoint me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s hand paused on the doorknob.</p><br/><p>Behind him, Shui QianRou\u2019s voice grew more resolute. \u201cThis is because you are Ling Tian, and because I have no one else to trust, hence I choose to trust you! Just like how the monarch has the ambition to surpass the heavens, I believe in Ling Tian!\u201d</p><br/><p>I believe in Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>This caused a huge jolt in Ling Tian\u2019s heart, and he slowly turned around. He saw Shui QianRou curled up on the chair, her head half drooped and her back towards him. Ling Tian suddenly felt as though this back was extremely lonely and desolate.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve said before, from the first time I met you, I already hoped that we would not turn into enemies. This sentence was true, as were my intentions then!\u201d After finishing his sentence, he did not turn back his head as he walked out.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s body trembled, and rigidly maintained her posture without turning her head. However, a patter was heard as two wet teardrops fell onto the ground.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Little Xue\u2019er, when you are at Sky Bearing, your job would be to be a good housekeeper and ensure the biggest benefit for my Ling Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue trembled, \u201cYou\u2026 you actually trust me that much? Aren\u2019t you afraid that I\u2019ll\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian waved his hand and stopped Xiao YanXue from continuing. He then said resolutely, \u201cIn my eyes, there isn\u2019t any princess, young miss or wealthy daughter in my family. There are only two kinds of ladies: First, my woman. Second, not my woman!\u201d Ling Tian said firmly, \u201cAnd you, Xiao YanXue, are a woman who I have acknowledged! I don\u2019t care what your original status was. I don\u2019t care if you are the little princess or young miss of the Xiao Family. I only know that if I cannot completely trust my woman, then how many people will be worthy of my trust in this world?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh, who is your woman! Who you acknowledge is your own business. You really know how to daydream. You obviously only want to make use of me\u2026\u201d Xiao YanXue\u2019s face was completely red and she was overjoyed in her heart. However, she still tried to remain calm on the surface, \u201cWhat I mean is\u2026 what I mean is\u2026 I am afraid that I will be incompetent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at her calmly and replied, \u201cI believe in you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018I believe in you!\u2019 Those four simple words created huge waves in Xiao YanXue\u2019s maiden heart! She had been forced by her family to give her all for her family, but this man in front of her dared to give her such a critical role despite her family being one of his enemies!</p><br/><p>He did it without any hesitation and was resolute in his actions!</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue suddenly felt like crying and looked at Ling Tian as though she wanted to firmly inscribe Ling Tian\u2019s words into her heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue then turned around and lowered her head. However, three resolute words came out from her lips slowly but firmly.</p><br/><p>I! Promise! You!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled warmly and pinched her nose before saying dotingly, \u201cWhy do you have to be so serious? It is only natural for a woman to help her man to do something. Look at you, you are acting as though I am forcing you to do something against your wishes. A little wish of mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue\u2019s whined in response, \u201cYou are the baddie who is trying to force me to do this! Hmph!\u201d She then rolled her eyes at Ling Tian and turned her head around. Ling Tian burst out laughing for a while before saying with a soft voice, \u201cIf things are really related to the Xiao Family, I won\u2019t make things difficult for you.\u201d After thinking for a while, Ling Tian said those words seriously.</p><br/><p>No matter what, Xiao YanXue was still the young miss of the Xiao Family and this was something that would never change. Since Ling Tian had decided to fight for hegemony in the world, he would have to face the Xiao Family eventually. At that time, rather than making things difficult for them, he might as well spell things out clearly today, lest the two of them have to miserably hide things in their hearts . At the very least, they could be open with each other and did not have to hide things behind each other\u2019s backs. After all, a hundred lies would be required to cover up a single lie. The most important thing was the fact that Ling Tian did not have the habit to lie to his own woman!</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue\u2019s body trembled and she turned around to look at Ling Tian. The rims of her eyes turned red and she said with a choking voice, \u201cTian\u2019ge, thank you. With those words of yours, I know that you will not lie to me! Those words of yours can put me at ease.\u201d With Ling Tian spelling out those words clearly, Xiao YanXue could feel that Ling Tian truly trusted her and also cared for her. At the very least, he wasn\u2019t trying to deceive her just to receive her help.</p><br/><p>At times, a woman\u2019s wish was truly simple\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, quickly wipe away your tears. Look at how pitiful your current appearance is. We are returning home soon and if someone else sees you like that, they would think that this infamous profligate young master has snatched another lady off the streets. If there is someone who wants to be the hero to save the damsel in distress, he would definitely beat me up.\u201d Ling Tian shook his head and added, \u201cThere will probably be more than one person. There should be many chivalrous heroes along the way standing up for righteousness and seeking trouble with me. These skinny limbs of mine would definitely not be able to endure it.\u201d After perfecting the thing that his Ling Family Courtyard lacked the most, Ling Tian was in an extremely good mood. He decided to crack a joke with Xiao YanXue although this joke of his wasn\u2019t funny at all.</p><br/><p>After Ling Tian achieved another breakthrough in his strength, there weren\u2019t many people in the world who could match up to him. With his current strength, even Justice would find it difficult to kill him!</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026 I am truly curious about just how big the family property of the Ling Family is? You have probably sneakily made plenty of profits right? I am truly curious.\u201d Xiao YanXue indeed laughed from Ling Tian\u2019s teasing.</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily property? It is only a small sum capable of supporting a few wives. It would definitely not enter the sight of the Southern Fortune Deity.\u201d Ling Tian said gloomily, \u201cSigh, I am truly a poor young man. Miss, you have to follow a chicken if you marry a chicken and follow a dog if you marry a dog. You have to carry the burdens of the family together with me and prepare yourself to starve on the streets.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d Xiao YanXue stretched out her hand in an attempt to pinch Ling Tian but the distance between the both of their horses could not be covered with her arm. Her pinch missed completely and she began waving her fists around instead like a ferocious lioness.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian burst out laughing and stretched out his arm to bring her over, \u201cI have snatched a tribal wife\u2026 no, I have snatched a fortune deity back home\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Amid their laughter, both the horses sped up and after making a turn, the dense Black Pine Forest appeared in front of them. At the same time, the miserable groans in the forest landed in Ling Tian\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could not help but be stunned. He never imagined that despite returning at the pace of a tortoise, he still didn\u2019t miss this exciting show before him. Seeing Ling Tian\u2019s frown, Xiao YanXue who was curled up in his embrace asked with concern, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Xiao YanXue\u2019s inner qi was limited and thus did not hear anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much, there are some fighting sounds ahead. It is probably two dogs trying to bite each other.\u201d Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cIt should be the Shui and Yu Families.\u201d Ling Tian looked to the horizon and saw the tallest pine tree in the vicinity. He then thought to himself that he should be able to see the battle if he was up on that pine tree.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Xiao YanXue rolled her eyes and said with a tinge of jealousy, \u201cThe little princess of the Yu Family is your fiancee. The little princess of the Shui Family is also in love with you. You actually dare to say that they are two dogs biting each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled awkwardly, \u201cIn my eyes, Little Xue\u2019er is also a cute puppy. You are all equally cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh! You are the puppy! B<em>st</em>rd!\u201d Xiao YanXue pummelled Ling Tian in anger before turning her head around.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled and urged his horse towards the forest. After entering the forest, Ling Tian suddenly grabbed Xiao YanXue and flew up into the sky, speedily traversing through the dense forest. He was truly like a gust of wind, weaving around the dense trees as he moved towards his target!</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s body tensed up in nervousness as she felt a sense of danger approach her! It was as though a top-notch expert was coming towards her. The pressure she felt from this expert was something extremely rare in this life of hers. Even if the pressure was slightly less than Justice, the difference wasn\u2019t huge. It was a pressure that could threaten her life! In this world, could there be such an expert apart from Justice?</p><br/><p>Li Xue finally felt a trace of fear. Even though she had been through two lives, she was still afraid of the death god! She could clearly feel that the speed of the person approaching her was something which she had never witnessed before in her life. She was probably not a match for this expert before her! Even Ling Tian who was at the tenth stage of the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula could not match this person in speed!</p><br/><p>Just who was he?!</p><br/><p>Li Xue finally recovered from her shock as she turned behind to take a look. With a loud swoosh, the incoming expert had already landed in front of her and the powerful gust of wind stopped abruptly. From his extreme speed to sudden stop, it was as though all of his actions had melded into the heavens and earth. His toes were lightly placed on top of a finger thick branch and the branch had only trembled slightly as though the one standing on top wasn\u2019t a living person but a small dragonfly! The figure of the expert was extremely stable and despite the winds in the surroundings he was still as stable as a mountain. Furthermore, there was a young lady in the arms of this expert!</p><br/><p>\u201cLi\u2026ng Tian?!\u201d Seeing the appearance of the incoming expert, Li Xue let out a cry of shock. She never imagined that this mysterious expert would be Ling Tian! She then quickly covered her lips, afraid that she would let out a loud shriek in shock!</p><br/><p>It was just too unexpected!</p><br/><p>After parting for a short month, Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts had actually improved so quickly like a rocket! His speed alone was definitely the number one in the world! Even the number one expert Justice would probably be incomparable to Ling Tian in terms of speed! Li Xue dared to say that there wouldn\u2019t be anyone else in the world capable of reaching such a speed. Furthermore, there was still someone in Ling Tian\u2019s embrace!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can truly meet anywhere in life. Pretty lady, we meet again.\u201d Ling Tian chuckled. He then looked at the gloomy sky and lowered his head to witness the bloody battle below him. After that, Ling Tian shook his head and pretended to sigh with grief, \u201cThe gloomy heavens loom above you and the blood red ground is painted before you. Miss Li Xue sits on the pine tree firmly with a natural and carefree expression. If there was a glass of red wine in your hand, it would truly be the perfection of life! Leading such a leisurely and elegant life truly leaves me in admiration.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlibbed tongue b<em>st</em>rd!\u201d Li Xue cursed, \u201cNo matter how leisurely my life is, how can I be compared to young noble Ling Tian who is hugging a beauty at a high point while expressionlessly observing the mountain of corpses and sea of blood below him?! This little lady here is the one who is in complete admiration! Hmph!\u201d The joy and excitement from seeing Ling Tian had been completely transformed into a belly full of anger. She hated the fact that she could not give him a bite as she cursed Ling Tian in her heart for being as annoying as he was in their previous life!</p><br/><p>Especially the fact that he could actually bring a beauty back in his arms despite going out to escape for his life! All of a sudden, Miss Li Xue\u2019s jealousy exploded forth from her heart!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

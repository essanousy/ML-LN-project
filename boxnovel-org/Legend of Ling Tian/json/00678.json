Ever since we ascended to the throne, we have been cautious and conscientious in managing the empire\u2019s affairs. Our age is already advanced and crown prince Long Xiao is competent in managing national affairs. We shall pass on the throne to crown prince Long Xiao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>After Old Master Ling praised himself, he immediately announced passing down of the throne\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCautious and conscientious in managing the empire\u2019s affairs\u2026\u201d Ling Tian was speechless and looked at the sky. \u201cMy dear grandfather, it hasn\u2019t been long since you became the empire but you have not even read a single memorial or handled any state affairs. Instead, you pushed everything to me and do not even attend court. To think that you are actually shameless enough to praise yourself for being cautious and conscientious. You are probably more of lazy and careless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stood up in anger, \u201cIt is nothing wrong for you to pass the throne to your son. But with the empire just founded, you should be the emperor for a month at the very least, right? To think that you are passing down the throne after a few days! You should discuss such an important matter with me at the very least, right? Even if you don\u2019t discuss it with me, you should gather the ministers for a discussion at the very least right\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stomped his feet in anger.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and Li Xue looked at each other and chuckled.</p><br/><p>The imperial decree immediately drifted over like snow. In just two days, before Ling Jian returned, Ling Tian had already received more than ten imperial decrees.</p><br/><p>Old Master Ling was successful in passing down the throne and Ling Xiao was immediately clad in yellow robes without the intention of rejecting the throne. He then made Old Master Ling the Imperial Ancestor and made Ling Tian the crown prince. He then spared the criminals in the empire\u2026</p><br/><p>In a mere three days, the criminals were spared twice!</p><br/><p>In other words, thrice in half a month\u2026</p><br/><p>When emperor Ling Xiao\u2019s imperial decree arrived at the Ling Family Courtyard, the new crown prince Ling Tian had already disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian escaped as though his rear was on fire together with Li Xue and Ling Chen. He could no longer wait for Ling Jian\u2019s reply. Since his father accepted the throne so easily, Ling Tian naturally knew what his father was planning.</p><br/><p>With Old Master Ling Zhan as an example, Ling Xiao was definitely intending to pass on the throne to Ling Tian for sure!</p><br/><p>Ignore everything else and pass down the throne!</p><br/><p>Emperor Ling Xiao was extremely gratified. Thankfully he had a son, if not he would not be able to escape so easily.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was extremely clear about his dad\u2019s personality and knew what Ling Xiao was intending to do. Thus, he immediately fled for his life the moment Old Master Ling passed down the throne to Ling Xiao.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s guess wasn\u2019t wrong. When he just left Sky Bearing City, his father Ling Xiao was clad in dragon robes with one of his feet stepping on a stool, looking like a bandit as he forced Meng LiGe to write an imperial decree to Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to disobey me? This daddy will execute you!\u201d Ling Xiao waved the imperial seal in his hands and was ready to stamp the decree. He had a baleful aura around him and it was truly a queer sight to see the monarch of an empire calling himself \u2018this daddy\u2019.</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe almost burst out crying. If he didn\u2019t write, he would have the crime of going against imperial orders. But if he wrote\u2026</p><br/><p>What empire would change two emperors in a single day?</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe had the urge to grab Ling Xiao by the collar and roar at him: This is the imperial throne! It is something of utmost importance! Not something for the three of you to play with!</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t the way to bully someone!</p><br/><p>But\u2026 he didn\u2019t dare to.</p><br/><p>The eunuch to pass the imperial decree didn\u2019t manage to pass on the decree. Ling Xiao flew into a rage and smashed the teacup in anger before returning to his bedroom in anger. He actually didn\u2019t sleep on the bed but laid on the floor\u2026</p><br/><p>In Ling Xiao\u2019s heart, the bed belonged to his son. It would be extremely disrespectful of him to sleep on the bed prepared for his son. After all, his son was about to get married\u2026</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Xiao slept on the floor without any concern in the world. After all, the empress, who was Ling Tian\u2019s mother, was still in the Ling Family Courtyard.</p><br/><p>The first ever emperor to sleep on the floor was born.</p><br/><p>This action of his was probably the first and last of its kind!</p><br/><p>Three hundred miles away from Sky Bearing City. Ling Tian was panting heavily under the tree as he sighed, \u201cIt is truly good to have a son! There isn\u2019t a need to do anything and I can just pass everything onto my son. Save time and trouble! I also wish to pass down the throne\u2026 but where is my son? I must accelerate the plan to make my next generation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and Li Xue burst out into laughter and sat down beside him. Ling Tian looked at Ling Chen\u2019s abdomen with suddenly giggled, \u201cAiyah, Chen\u2019er, we have been doing that plenty of times and I have always tried my best to attack the city. However, why is your stomach still so silent? Why is my accuracy so low? Also, there is also Yan\u2019er, shouldn\u2019t there be some commotion at the very least?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen lowered her head with her face reddened and was embarrassed to the point she did not know what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh, you are the one who is ignorant. How dare you blame her instead? Little sister Yan has been suffering from the Divine Black Negative Meridians for many years. Now that she recovered from her illness, she will need three to five years for her body to recover and there isn\u2019t a need to think about her. As for little sister Chen\u2026\u201d Li Xue snorted and looked at Ling Tian with disdain, \u201cYou are the one who acted smart and got Ling Chen to cultivate the Divine Ice Formula. How can there be a chance for her to get pregnant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Ling Chen exclaimed in shock and grabbed Li Xue\u2019s arm with anxiousness in her eyes.</p><br/><p>As a lady in this generation, it would be a great regret for a lady to be unable to conceive for her beloved man. Furthermore, passing down the family line was an extremely important matter in this world!</p><br/><p>Ling Chen also had her doubts about this matter before. With her young noble doting on her over the past few years, she should have already had a child by now. Furthermore, her body had always been healthy and she had even found a physician in secret before to ensure that nothing was wrong with her. However, it would be even more ludicrous for Ling Tian to be the problem! Now that she heard Li Xue mention the truth of this matter, she could not help but be shocked!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian also became anxious, \u201cWhat do you mean by this? Quickly explain the matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue let out a sigh and said, \u201cLittle sister Yan isn\u2019t a big problem. When her cultivation accumulates and her body recovers, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for her to conceive. However, little sister Chen only knows how to impart martial arts but do not know that certain martial arts have their own taboos. Just like in our\u2026 house, how many ladies have cultivated the Divine Ice Formula before? However, how many of them would end up marrying? For those who get married, most of them would end up guarding a man bitterly for their entire life without any title or position. Not a single one of them had any children. Why is this so?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026 why is this the case?\u201d Ling Tian was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor a lady to conceive, she requires the yang energy of a man to mix together with her yin energy before a child can be born! Long yin isn\u2019t normal and long yang will not last long. However, the Divine Ice Formula is a pure yin formula that will make a lady\u2019s body be even colder than pure yin. How would she be able to conceive?! However\u2026\u201d Li Xue paused for a moment and changed her tone upon seeing Ling Chen\u2019s dejected appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t completely impossible for you to conceive, only that the conditions are extremely stringent. First, the individual who cultivates the Divine Ice Formula has to cultivate to the peak and enter XianTian. After converting all of the HouTian Divine Ice inner qi into XianTian pure qi, and reversing the flow of the inner qi, one would be able to form a pure XianTian Yin body. At that time, one\u2019s cultivation would attain its peak with the ability to resonate with the twelfth stage of the Divine Shocking Dragon Formula. However, our current environment is lacking with a severe deficiency of XianTian pure qi. Not to mention cultivating from HouTian to XianTian and tempering one\u2019s body to the peak, it would be a difficult matter for one to even cultivate to the seventh or eighth stage! It is also because of this that despite the strength of the Divine Ice Formula, it isn\u2019t widespread.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt means that the Divine Ice Formula must be cultivated to the peak before one can conceive?\u201d Ling Tian interrupted and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Li Xue answered honestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why did you cultivate this formula?\u201d Ling Tian asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason is extremely simple. First, I am like little sister Chen and have a pure Yin body. Cultivating the Divine Ice Formula is the number one cultivation method to rapidly increase my cultivation. Second, I never imagined that I would give birth to a child for someone else! Are these two reasons sufficient?!\u201d Li Xue replied coldly.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was speechless. These two reasons were truly too potent! The second reason was extremely moving as well! At that time, Li Xue couldn\u2019t be sure that Ling Tian had also arrived in this world. To a proud lady like her, how would she lower her standards and accept a man from this alternate world? Thus, her reason for cultivating the Divine Ice Formula was extremely acceptable!</p><br/><p>\u201cElder sister Xue, according to your judgment, how long will it take for me to cultivate to such a level?\u201d Ling Chen asked anxiously. At this moment, she could not be bothered with her embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Li Xue looked at her and let out a long sigh. Ling Chen could not help but grow anxious and her voice began to crack, \u201cSister Xue, could it be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue burst out into laughter, \u201cLittle sister Chen, you are too shameless. Are you so eager to give this bad egg a child? Hmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s face turned red and she began to whine.</p><br/><p>Looking at Li Xue\u2019s expression, Ling Tian knew that she definitely had an idea. If not, since she also cultivated the Divine Ice Formula, she wouldn\u2019t be so heartless.</p><br/><p>Indeed, Li Xue smiled and said, \u201cIn truth, our Divine Ice Formula has reached the peak of the tenth stage and we have already entered the XianTian realm. We are only a step away from the large completion stage. With our current speed, if we are able to find the aid of some suitable herbs, I am confident that we will be able to achieve a breakthrough within two years. At that time, little sister Chen can give birth to as many litters as you wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen\u2019s face reddened in shyness. \u201cYou are the one who will give birth to litters. I am not a sow.\u201d She was finally at ease. While two years wasn\u2019t short, it wasn\u2019t considered too long either.</p></div>\n</div>"}

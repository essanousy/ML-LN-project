Her lovable face was dripping with sweat as she panted, \u201cXiao\u2019ge, what do you think of Tian\u2019er\u2019s performance today?\u201d [1]</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao lay there bare chested, revealing muscles that looked as though they were crafted from granite. After the \u201cexercise\u201d, he lay contentedly on the pillow with narrowed eyes, looking as though his soul had flown elsewhere. However, upon hearing the words uttered by his wife, he distractedly stared at her for a while before raging, \u201cThat little bastard, he behaved totally without control and discipline today. This is too much. I am going to give him a good lesson tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er only lightly laughed as she stretched out her first finger and drew circles on her husband\u2019s chest while she breathily said, \u201cYou, always being such a blockhead. Couldn\u2019t you see that Tian\u2019er mannerisms and way of speaking were far above a normal 10-year-old child? At first glance, today\u2019s matters would appear to be Tian\u2019er causing a tantrum. However, this little guy can twist the truth such that an unjustified matter becomes as though he had suffered some great grievance. Don\u2019t you feel this is very abnormal?\u201d</p><br/><p>Furrowing his brows, Ling Xiao carefully thought about it before he realized that there was something different about it, \u201cThat is true, he is just a five-year-old kid; how can he be able to speak so eloquently? It\u2019s to the point where he managed to silence the family members as well as Mister Qin, making everyone dance to his tune. Looks like our child seems to be a genius-level character!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er\u2019s face was full of pride, \u201cOf course, how could my son be an ordinary character in a generation?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Ling Xiao\u2019s mouth tugged upwards in a weird smile, and with both his hands itching forward under the blankets, he suddenly grabbed onto the bountiful globes sticking out proudly from Chu Ting\u2019er\u2019s chest. Applying a bit of force, both of the soft white humps were depressed based on the imprint of his fingers, as he lecherously spoke, \u201cYour son? Without me, how could you have given birth? Hmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>With a lovable moan, Chu Ting\u2019er suddenly lost strength in her entire body, and her eyes started to blur as she began to pant delicately while saying, \u201cYou bad man! While I\u2019m here talking about serious matters, you just had to play dirty tricks\u2026 Ohh\u2026\u201d At this time, one of Ling Xiao\u2019s hand decided to go for a change in position and started to explore down south. Chu Ting\u2019er started to tremble all over her body, and buried her face that was flushed red in embarrassment into her husband\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao sniggered as he said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this part of a serious matter?\u201d And with a flip of his body\u2026</p><br/><p>A long while later, Chu Ting\u2019er let out a satisfied sigh, using a slender hand to push aside the hair on the forehead that was matted with sweat. Although her face was flushed red with exertion, the corners of the mouth revealed a blissful smile. Sprawling on her husband like a kitten, she said, \u201cXiao\u2018ge, Ting\u2019er can die of blissfulness\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao, however, lay there paralyzed like a pile of mud and exhaled heavily as he said, \u201cYou can die from bliss, but I will die from fatigue. I almost lost all strength here\u2026 My little baby, you bewitching girl\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHateful!\u201d Chu Ting\u2019er displayed shyness and anger, yet was secretly delighted as she lightly hit him. Her eyes blurred with tenderness and love, as if tears were about to fall.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026.\u201d Seeing that incomparably seductive look on his beloved\u2019s face, Ling Xiao nearly transformed into a wolf there and then.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe more serious! I\u2019m talking to you about Tian\u2019er!\u201d Chu Ting\u2019er knew that her husband was not able to resist her charms and immediately burrowed into the covers, only revealing her charming little head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, seems like Tian\u2019er\u2019s performance today is far exceeding my expectations.\u201d Ling Xiao muttered irresolutely.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely, regarding how Tian\u2019er behaved today, even as his mother, I was surprised and even shocked. Tian\u2019er\u2019s intelligence has already exceeded my expectations.\u201d Chu Ting\u2019er revealed a face of concern and worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cHm? It should be a good thing that Tian\u2019er is intelligent and witty. What are you worried about?\u201d Ling Xiao was flabbergasted at his wife.</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er let out a face of contemplation as she pondered, \u201cXiao\u2018ge, don\u2019t you feel that Tian\u2019er today was too smart and wily? If a child is smart, I should be happy as the mother, but if he is too smart, it would be easy for him to walk down the wrong path; furthermore, a higher intelligence means that it will not be easy to discipline him, don\u2019t you feel so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao said with a gleeful expression, \u201cWhy would there be such a problem? Hehe, among our Ling family\u2019s ancestors, including my father and I, we were all gutsy and boorish men. Never once did a strategist appear in the family. Now that we finally have a genius in the family, Ting\u2019er, this could be said to be all your credit!\u201d As he spoke, Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes became lecherous once again, and that pair of lecherous hands also started to stir.</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er helplessly stared at her husband, half wanting to laugh and half wanting to be angry. But after a long while, she instead let out a sigh, jabbing her finger at her husband\u2019s head, saying, \u201cYou\u2026 Speaking with you is just like playing a harp to a cow!\u201d [2]</p><br/><p>Ling Xiao snickered as his sturdy body once again pounced over, and Chu Ting\u2019er could only try her utmost to prevent the invasion of his lecherous hands as she gasped, \u201cWait\u2026 wait a moment, I\u2019m not done\u2026 For Ling Tian to be so smart, father is actually wasting his time to find so many tutors to coach him and I\u2019m worried that he would be fed up with it\u2026 Woo\u2026 you bad boy!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Ling Xiao invaded the \u201ccapital\u201d, he vaguely mumbled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, tomorrow I will speak with father about this. Hehehe\u2026 woah\u2026. so smooth\u2026\u201d What occurred next naturally turned the room into a place of spring.</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian soundlessly thread his way out of his underground chamber, he felt a little strange. Every night, around this time, his mother would brave all winds and rain to make her way to his room to check up on him, so why had she not turned up today?</p><br/><p>Regarding how loving his parents were, Ling Tian was deeply aware and suffered many times because of it. Before he was three, the two of them treated him like how they would do to an ordinary infant, and were not discreet in doing their \u201cstuff\u201d. Thus, every night became a form of torture to Ling Tian, and yet, because he was in the body of an infant, he was unable to voice out his own thoughts.</p><br/><p>Seeing his parents beside him making love without a care for Ling Tian beside them, Ling Tian felt depressed to the point of dying! Oh heavens, I\u2019m someone who has lived for two lifetimes and twenty odd years as a virgin! Those few years, when they woke up, although their parents seemed to be in great vitality, Ling Tian always appeared drowsy with a lack of vigor. He was always afraid that he would either die of a massive nosebleed or a heart attack\u2026</p><br/><p>This matter continued until the point where Ling Tian celebrated his fourth birthday. When asked what gift he would like for his birthday, he immediately chose to sleep apart from his parents without any hesitation. He even went to the extra mile to ensure that his room was a little further apart from his parents and was resolute about his decision. Hence, his family members could only accede to his request and employed a few nannies and servant girls to attend to his needs. From then on, after sleeping on his own, Ling Tian unexpectedly became more robust, which made the family amazed and feel at ease. Under Ling Tian\u2019s insistence, they also allowed him to push out those nannies from this strange young master\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>This was of course a given; without at least three times of nightly sexual harassment, Ling Tian was feeling much better physically and mentally! As Ling Tian secretly rejoiced, he was also in awe of his father\u2019s exuberant prowess. When no one was looking, he would secretly open up his pants and examine his JJ, fantasizing if he would inherit this sort of godly vigor\u2026 Every time this happened, a weird licentious giggle would sound out from the lone room which Ling Tian stayed in\u2026 and this would always cause goosebumps to form as well as shivers down the spine of those servant girls who were staying nearby and heard it\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s decision made his mother, Chu Ting\u2019er, extremely sad and worn out. Out of worry, she checked on Ling Tian every day, resulting in Ling Xiao being unable to satisfy his lust for a period of time. As such, he was always frowning whenever he saw his son.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt at peace; no matter what, this was better than having a live broadcast every night, was it not? Furthermore, Ling Tian looked at his father in disdain, as he only knew those few styles, how uncreative\u2026</p><br/><p>Since his mother had not come to check up on him until now, Ling Tian could already foretell that his mother would not be coming. As for the reason, hehehe, the Buddha says that such a thing must not be spoken.</p><br/><p>[1]: Xiao\u2019ge is an intimate way for Chu Ting\u2019er to call Ling Xiao.

Yu ZhanKong then said with a smile, \u201cOld Madam, if that\u2019s the case, then can we send a few guards to escort our little princess? The little princess is the beloved of our Yu Family and if\u2026 ah ah, Family Head will end up blaming us for not guarding her well. These few people are all the servants who usually serve the little princess and it will be convenient to have them around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them had the same thought: Might as well make use of this opportunity to see the strength of the mysterious Ling Family Courtyard.</p><br/><p>Old Madam Ling considered for a moment before agreeing.</p><br/><p>The large troop surrounded Yu BingYan\u2019s carriage and left the southern gate slowly.</p><br/><p>Apart from Ling Chen, Ling Jian, Ling Feng, Ling Yun and the rest, there were ten white jade, twenty purple jade, and a large crowd following behind the carriage. Along the way, they looked extremely careful as though they might face an enemy attack at any time.</p><br/><p>The willow forest was right in front of them and the Ling Family Courtyard\u2019s buildings could be seen on the horizon. Under the reflection of the sunlight, the buildings looked as though they were all glowing and golden in color. The thirty experts of the Yu Family immediately revealed a fascinated expression as they thought, Is this the Ling Family Courtyard that the Family Head instructed us to pay attention to? Just what is the Ling Family Courtyard like? What is special about it?</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, the carriage stopped and when everyone was in doubt, a white-dressed teen walked over and said to the Yu Family members coldly, \u201cThe Ling Family Courtyard is right in front and I thank everyone for guarding our young madam. Without the orders of our young noble, nobody will be allowed to enter the Courtyard. We will ensure the safety of our young madam, and I invite the rest of you to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInvite us to leave? You must be joking!\u201d A white jade expert leading the way sneered, \u201cThis is the little princess of our Yu Family and we must definitely escort her into a safe place. We can only leave after ensuring her safety. What are your intentions, asking us to leave now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I ask you to scram, all of you better scram! If you frustrate this daddy here, I will dice all of you up and dump you in the ocean!\u201d A violent voice sounded and the whole forest was filled with a killing intent. In that instant, all the Yu Family members felt a layer of frost over them.</p><br/><p>While Ling Jian was still standing there without a change in his posture, his aura had changed completely. Despite still wearing the attire of a servant, the aura emanating from him had the prestige to destroy the heavens and earth! Under the pressure from his aura, the thirty experts of the Yu Family subconciously took a step back with perspiration all over their heads!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you!\u201d The white-dressed man in the lead looked at Ling Jian without backing down, \u201cFriend, what fabulous martial arts! Are you really called Ling Jian? Are you really a servant of the Ling Family?\u201d The way he saw it, such an expert was definitely a world famous character. How was it possible for him to be a mere servant of the Ling Family? However, the name \u2018Ling Jian\u2019 was completely unknown and thus such a question. As long as they knew his true name, they would naturally have a way to deal with him.</p><br/><p>His tone was cold and expression stern with his tone neither too servile or overbearing. The white-dressed man was certain that the way he carried himself did not insult the name of a white jade expert of their Yu Family. However, even he didn\u2019t realize that under the prestige of Ling Jian\u2019s aura, he inevitably felt a subconscious fear towards Ling Jian! As for Ling Jian\u2019s humiliating words, he didn\u2019t even dare to retort at all!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is your honor for all of you to hear my real name!\u201d Ling Tian snorted with unconcealed killing intent in his eyes, \u201cIf all of you are not going to leave, it will really be your misfortune.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMisfortune? This Yu wants to see how it will be our misfortune!\u201d Even a man made of clay will have anger, not to mention a white jade expert of the Yu Family! Despite feeling a strong pressure from Ling Jian\u2019s aura, this white dressed man could no longer rein in his anger and issued a challenge!</p><br/><p>With a loud \u2018shiiiing\u2019, he pointed his sword at Ling Jian, \u201cIf you can defeat me, we will leave obediently as per your orders. But if you cannot win, then you better make way!\u201d Although he was angry, he still left a way out for himself and his subordinates.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian snickered and placed his hand on the hilt of his sword. With his eyes staring at the white dressed man coldly, a thunderous roar sounded in the forest! It was Ling Jian pulling out his sword slightly, imbuing his inner qi within the body of his sword and causing it to shake within its sheath. The resulting sound from the friction sounded like thousands of soldiers charging down a battlefield!</p><br/><p>The skies were filled with an abundant sword qi being emanated from Ling Jian\u2019s sword which wasn\u2019t even fully out of its sheath! Ling Jian stood there like a mountain and looked as though he was a precious sword that was unleashed from its sheath!</p><br/><p>The black iron sword was only unsheathed half a foot, shining resplendently in the sun!</p><br/><p>Before the sword was fully unsheathed, the members of the Yu Family were all defeated mentally! Fear could be seen in all of their eyes as their faces turned pale and they lost all will to battle!</p><br/><p>Before they even exchanged a single blow, victory had been determined!</p><br/><p>The expert leading the Yu Family let out a sigh as his body deflated and spat out a mouthful of blood. While Ling Jian did not make a move, he was standing right in front of Ling Jian and had to circulate all of his inner qi to block Ling Jian\u2019s aura. At such a level, life and death could happen in an instant with the strong surviving and the weak perishing. His meridians were already injured by Ling Jian\u2019s formless sword qi and his life was hanging by a thread!</p><br/><p>Pin drop silence!</p><br/><p>With a loud clang, Ling Jian\u2019s sword returned to the sheath and silence returned to the forest. Ling Jian\u2019s cold gaze swept past the Yu Family experts and none of them dared to even raise their heads.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian let out a sneer before shouting, \u201cLeave!\u201d</p><br/><p>The carriage started to move again and the members of the Ling Family followed behind it. Under the setting sun, the thirty members of the Yu Family stood there in a daze. The shadows cast by the setting sun had an inexplicable desolate feeling!</p><br/><p>Before they arrived, who would have thought that the thirty Yu Family experts wouldn\u2019t even dare to unsheath their sword when facing Ling Jian?</p><br/><p>The curtains of the carriage were lifted and Yu BingYan\u2019s head stuck out, \u201cHave they left?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen smiled and said, \u201cRest assured sister BingYan, everything is in our control.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan let out a melancholic sigh, \u201cSister Chen, for such a thing to happen, this little sister is truly ashamed. I have let you down, I have let the Ling Family down, and I have let Tian\u2019ge down\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen paused for a moment before saying, \u201cSister BingYan, do you know that young noble had already predicted the Yu Family\u2019s actions before he left? If he knew the choice that you made, he would definitely be very gratified.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan let out a long depressed sigh as she forced a smile, \u201cChoice? I have not made any choice and cannot make any choices. If both families were to fight in the open, I may not have helped any sides. However, such a despicable action is not something which I can accept and I will only stand on the side of my beloved!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen responded with an \u2018Mmm\u2019 before continuing, \u201cJust relax and everything will be over soon. Young noble also wishes for you to grow quickly so you can be of aid to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan nodded her head obediently and suddenly asked, \u201cSister Chen, there is something that I have never understood. Isn\u2019t the Sky Bearing Imperial Family already destroyed and remains in name only? As an empire, shouldn\u2019t Sky Bearing have a Martial Order Medallion as well? If Tian\u2019ge took out the Martial Order Medallion, wouldn\u2019t he be able to avoid his crisis? Why didn\u2019t Tian\u2019ge do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen let out a dim smile, \u201cI asked Mister Ye about this after young noble left. Mister Ye said that the Martial Order Medallion can only be used in the hands of an imperial family member. If someone of another surname were to use it, it would only result in a calamity! If not, with the many experts in the world, wouldn\u2019t the eight Martial Order Medallions end up falling into the hands of the pugilistic world?\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she looked at Yu BingYan with a smile, \u201cIf not for this restriction, with the strength of the Yu Family, wouldn\u2019t it be an easy task to gather all eight medallions? If that\u2019s the case, wouldn\u2019t Beyond Heavens turn into the slave of the Yu Family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan nodded her head and was enlightened, \u201cI see!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen let out a sigh, \u201cWhat a pity, there isn\u2019t anyone left with Long Xiang\u2019s blood in Sky Bearing and Princess JiaoYue is a lady. If not, as long as we resorted to some means, this crisis would be averted!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan fell silent for a while before letting out a sigh and returning to her carriage.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian rushed forward silently and walked beside Ling Chen.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen looked at Ling Jian and was reminded by Ling Jian\u2019s previous performance, \u201cLing Jian, have you broken through and felt the feeling of being one with the sword? Do you feel as though you are at the peak of the sword way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian paused for a moment and answered honestly, \u201cThat\u2019s right, I do have such a feeling! I feel as though there isn\u2019t anyone in this world capable of fighting me and no one I cannot kill! That is also the reason why I wanted to help young noble. While that green dressed expert is frightening, I believe that if I sacrifice my life, I will be able to seriously injure that Justice!\u201d As he said that, he looked at Ling Chen. Up until now, he was still brooding over the fact that Ling Chen stopped him from saving Ling Tian. However, he did not dare to throw a fit because of Ling Tian\u2019s orders. Now that Ling Chen was asking him about his martial arts progress, he wanted to make use of this opportunity to say his piece.</p><br/><p>\u201cI knew that you would definitely be unconvinced.\u201d Ling Chen let out a bitter laugh and looked towards Ling Jian with a teasing look, \u201cWhen you entered into seclusion, I asked young noble something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen paused for a while and saw that Ling Jian\u2019s face grew serious, \u201cAt that time, young noble said that if you can achieve a breakthrough in your seclusion, you will be able to truly enter the entrance of being one with the sword! Mmm, just the entrance.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

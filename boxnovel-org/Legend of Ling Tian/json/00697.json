Anxious about what? Having a son! With a son, there would be hope for him to abandon his present bitter life!</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t that simple for him to have a son. First, he would have to prepare for marriage. As such, another wave of excitement was sent forth. This time, they would have to make ample preparations for the wedding. With Ling Tian\u2019s ascension to the throne being settled in a rush, they would definitely not rush through Ling Tian\u2019s wedding this time.</p><br/><p>The date of the wedding was set for half a year later on the fifth day of the ninth month.</p><br/><p>After setting the date, most of the ladies went back to their own houses. Since the Heavenly Wind Continent was too far, Shui QianRou decided to stay in the Shui Family Courtyard located in Sky Bearing. The Xiao Family that just arrived at Sky Bearing fetched Xiao YanXue away, and the Ling Family fetched three back at the same time, Ling Chen, Li Xue, and Princess JiaoYue.</p><br/><p>Mmm, they prepared a dowry from their own house before sending it over to their own son\u2026</p><br/><p>As for Yu BingYan, the extremely busy Yu ManLou sent Yu ManTian to fetch her back.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Ling Tian announced to the world that Ling Jian would be conferred with the title of Divine Sword Duke! At the same time, he appointed Xiao YouHan to be married to Ling Jian and the date of the wedding was to be set on the same day as Ling Tian\u2019s wedding!</p><br/><p>Because of this, the court argued for half a day saying that it did not adhere to the proper rules. A few dozen important ministers had even knelt down and refused to get up, pleading to Ling Tian to retract his orders.</p><br/><p>Helpless, Ling Tian could only set Ling Jian\u2019s wedding to the nineteenth of the ninth month!</p><br/><p>The entire Divine Prefecture Empire broke out into a wave of celebration. With all the taxes in the empire being waived, the agriculture department expanded rapidly and prosperity could be seen in a short few months.</p><br/><p>After the army of the Divine Prefecture Empire reorganized themselves, they began marching towards the north-west endlessly.</p><br/><p>The battle to determine the ruler of the continent would be determined in the north-west!</p><br/><p>The Ling and Yu Family which were about to be joint in marriage will break out in battle eventually!</p><br/><p>The entire world was looking forward to it!</p><br/><p>After this battle, regardless of who the victor was, the entire world would welcome a period of peace! If the Divine Prefecture Empire of the Ling Family achieves victory, this peace may last for a couple of decades of even centuries\u2026</p><br/><p>Half a year has passed by in a flash!</p><br/><p>The Yu Family.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang had returned victorious from his previous expedition to the Moon Deity Empire. The Moon Deity Empire without the Lei Family guarding it was like a tiger without its teeth. It wasn\u2019t able to put up the slightest bit of resistance in the face of the ferocious attack of the Yu Family and there was no longer a Moon Deity Empire in the world. They were absorbed into the Divine Jade Empire and the Moon Deity Empire had become a part of history.</p><br/><p>However, not a trace of joy could be seen on the face of Yu ManTang who had returned with a victory. The officers who were familiar with him all knew that Yu ManTang\u2019s face had always been gloomy since the day he led his troops out from Bright Jade City. Even when he led the troops to victory and the entire army celebrated, the look on their marshal\u2019s face never changed.</p><br/><p>It was as though his heart was always burdened with a mountain of troubles which could not be solved!</p><br/><p>In truth, ever since Yu ManTang returned from Heavenly Wind, he had always been filled with troubles.</p><br/><p>Only when he returned to Bright Jade City, met his daughter again and find out about his daughter\u2019s wedding could a trace of a smile be seen on his gloomy face. After knowing about this, Yu ManTang immediately went to find Yu ManLou.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, I don\u2019t wish for any accidents to happen during BingYan\u2019s wedding.\u201d After seeing Yu ManLou, this was the first sentence that he said. His expression was calm but his tone was resolute, \u201cThis is the most important matter to BingYan and also something that she has dreamed of for a long time. I hope that she will be able to be married out happily without any accidents.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou who was busy in front of his desk paused for a moment before lifting his head up with a cold gaze, \u201cBingYan is my beloved niece and her wedding would naturally be a joyous occasion. I also hope that there won\u2019t be any accidents during her wedding. I wonder what Second Brother means by your words? I hope to hear some clarification!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang snorted coldly and looked outside the window. A short while later, he said slowly, \u201cThe four elders of the Star Picking Tower are dead. I killed them!\u201d He then left the imperial study without saying another word or turning back.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou snorted coldly and his sharp gaze became sinister. With a crisp \u2018pa\u2019 sound, the brush in his hand was shattered into pieces.</p><br/><p>The First Elder appeared behind him without a sound. \u201cYour Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou stood up and placed his hands behind his back. Without saying a word, Yu ManLou\u2019s gaze swept past the First Elder and he walked to the window.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe four brothers were killed by Second Master,\u201d the First Elder stammered, \u201cfurthermore, both Second and Third Master led their men to the Star Picking Tower personally\u2026 I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou looked out the window expressionlessly for a long while before letting out a long breath, \u201cForget it!\u201d Turning around, he said calmly, \u201cGive my order to prepare for Princess Bright Jade\u2019s wedding. This is the first marriage of a princess from our empire and the dowry must be well prepared. Do not do anything else and no one is to interfere with this matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The First Elder bowed before walking out.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou stood in front of the window without moving. His majestic figure suddenly seemed a little lonely and desolate at this moment.</p><br/><p>A gust of wind blew in from outside the window and a couple of yellow leaves drifted down from the tree and landed before Yu ManLou.</p><br/><p>The wind blew into the room and the stack of paper on the table fluttered in the wind. A piece of paper drifted into the air and landed on the ground. On the paper, a couple of sentences were written.</p><br/><p>\u201c200,000 soldiers were added to the Swallow County and they moved thirty miles up north.</p><br/><p>In front of the Mourning Soul Mountain, 300,000 elites of the Ling Family suddenly exited the valley.</p><br/><p>In the north-east direction, the DongFang Family sent 200,000 soldiers personally led by DongFang JingLei to the borders.</p><br/><p>In the south, Yu ChengLong\u2019s 300,000 men army had set up camp fifteen miles north-west of the Swallow County.</p><br/><p>In the south-east, Xiao FengYang personally led 600,000 soldiers and were marching their way to the Swallow County!</p><br/><p>Note: The mysterious First Pavilion has finally surfaced and the First Pavilion Head is the number one subordinate under Ling Tian: Ling Jian! The First Pavilion is definitely an organization that belonged to Ling Tian and Ling Jian was conferred the title of Divine Sword Duke.</p><br/><p>Above Heavens in the Southeast was ambushed by Ling Tian and was completely wiped out! Including the Sect Master, Meng FanYun, not a single person managed to escape alive. According to rumors, Justice from Beyond Heavens had taken action in this battle!</p><br/><p>\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>News came one after another and every single piece of news was bad news!</p><br/><p>Just the number of soldiers camping along their borders numbered close to 2,000,000!</p><br/><p>This was Ling Tian giving him an obvious signal. After the wedding is completed, the gamble for the entire continent shall begin!</p><br/><p>\u201c2,000,000 soldiers, the assassins of the First Pavilion, the Xiao Family submitting, how fantastic Ling Tian! In just a short few years, your strength has actually grown to such an extent!\u201d Yu ManLou muttered, \u201cIs it time for our five years agreement, the gamble for the world to begin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Dark clouds could be seen all over Yu ManLou\u2019s face and he turned around and seemed to be talking to the air, \u201cTighten our defensive circle and begin conscripting soldiers. All of our soldiers are to be sent towards Swallow County and we do not have to guard the other areas! If the enemy doesn\u2019t move, we shall not move!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian, I shall accompany you to write this crazy segment of history! Let us see who will be the last one laughing!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was finally the ninth month! The fifth day!</p><br/><p>In the largest plaza of Sky Bearing, the Emperor of the Divine Prefecture Empire was holding a never seen before majestic wedding! He was going to marry six wives together.</p><br/><p>According to the rites, with Ling Tian being emperor and Ling Chen being the empress, there wasn\u2019t a reason for them to hold their wedding together with others. However, Ling Tian insisted on doing so and it was a hint to his other women that he would treat all of his women fairly. Regardless of whether she was the empress or consort, it was no more than a title. In his heart, all six of them had the same status.</p><br/><p>The north gate was open! The nine celebratory cannons sounded!</p><br/><p>3000 of the Yu Family\u2019s warriors were dressed in festive attire as they led an extremely luxurious carriage. Sixteen snow-white horses with a bright red cloth over them led the carriages and Yu BingYan sat in the carriage arriving from the north.</p><br/><p>At the front of the troops, the scholarly Yu ManTang cupped his fists towards the surrounding crowd to display his thanks with his face beaming with joy. Beside him, the \u2018elegant\u2019 Third Master Yu, Yu ManTian, sat on a horse with his big belly protruding. The majestic looking horse had been squashed by Yu ManTian\u2019s large body to the point it took every step with great difficulty. He was clad entirely in red robes and it made Third Master Yu\u2019s black face stand out even more.</p><br/><p>With Yu ManTang and Yu ManTian personally escorting the troops, it was sufficient to show their Yu Family\u2019s sincerity towards this marriage. Regardless of what happens between the two families in the future, they still seemed to be extremely harmonious at the present moment.</p><br/><p>At the same time\u2026</p><br/><p>The east gate was opened and the Xiao Family\u2019s troops also streamed in. While the Xiao Family was already a matter of the past, they were still a financial magnate and the luxury of their troops was something that even the Yu Family couldn\u2019t compare to.</p><br/><p>Outside the west gate the Shui Family, which was also a top-notch family, was dressed in festival attire as they escorted their little princess Shui QianRou. The Family Head of the Shui Family, Shui ManKong as well as the other important figures of the family had appeared together.</p><br/><p>However, the place that was bustling with the most excitement was the center of Sky Bearing city.</p><br/><p>Colorful ribbons and decorations filled the entire Sky Bearing city.</p><br/><p>The doors to the Ling Residence was opened widely and three exquisite sedans left the residence. In every single one of these sedans, a beautiful figure could be seen within them.</p><br/><p>An empress and two consorts had exited from the Ling Residence!</p><br/><p>A wave of cheers could be heard.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian ran around with joy all over his face and his usually cold appearance was no more. To him and his fifty brothers, today was truly a joyous occasion!</p></div>\n</div>"}

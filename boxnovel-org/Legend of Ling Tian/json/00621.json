Get out here! Your daddy here will teach you how to act like a servant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian frowned as he looked at the short and round figure in the snow and mocked, \u201cSending such a character out in this weather is truly fitting. He is truly the best person to roll into a snowball.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is still too early to talk about who is going to become the snowball!\u201d Yu XiaoRan said with a mellow tone.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian walked forward slowly and stood in front of the stumpy elder with a bloodthirsty killing intent. The words of this elder had truly incited the killing intent in his heart! However, Ling Tian had already given him the order to control his strength and had forbidden him to kill any of them. Ling Jian suddenly let out a clear roar.</p><br/><p>The sound of footsteps could suddenly be heard from all directions. There were both young and old, chattering as they gathered towards the little yard. In just a short while, the whole yard was filled with a bunch of people looking forward to witnessing a good show. There were even a few young ladies who took out stools to take a seat while watching the show.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 just what do you mean by this?\u201d The stumpy elder was shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, it has been a long time since I exchanged pointers with someone and they are all here to watch the show.\u201d Ling Jian said in a carefree manner.</p><br/><p>Watch your majesty? Don\u2019t you mean your impotence! The six elders cursed with disdain in their hearts. Don\u2019t you know of our origins? Relying on your status as Ling Tian\u2019s little study attendant to throw your weight around? The few of us do not belong to your Ling Family and will not allow a little brat like you to do as you wish! Even if this old man takes care of you, we will still be in the right when we face Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Jian, you will pay a price for your actions and words! Even if young noble Ling Tian is here, I believe that he will agree with this old man teaching you a lesson! Hurry up and kowtow to admit your mistakes! If you are able to move this old man with your sincerity, this old man will spare your life!\u201d The stumpy elder stood in the middle of the boundless snow and emanated the aura of a top-notch expert.</p><br/><p>With so many people observing the battle, the stumpy elder naturally had to maintain his disposition. He did not even let out a single expletive and maintained his elegance of an aristocratic family\u2019s elder. He had to maintain his elegance before taking action and leave Ling Jian with a chance!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian stood in front of him with his hands behind his back and watched the stumpy elder coldly before shaking his head, \u201cTeach me a lesson? You will know what it means to pay the price later! Old fogey, come and fight me if you wish! If you don\u2019t wish to fight, I shall go back and have some tea. Old man, for you to come to Sky Bearing from afar, isn\u2019t it because you wanted to display your skills?\u201d</p><br/><p>After following Ling Tian for such a long time, Ling Jian did indeed learn plenty of things. At the very least, he was able to say such words with depth. Of course, saying is one thing but whether or not he understood was another.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeeing that you are only a servant of young age, if you are willing to kowtow and accept your mistakes, this old man shall forgive you with magnanimity this time.\u201d The stumpy elder had his arms behind his back as he tried acting cool. Despite his watermelon-like figure, he was trying his best to put on a suave appearance. However, it was a pity that the difficulty of that was far too high.</p><br/><p>\u201cIncurable!\u201d Ling Jian sighed. All of a sudden, his body shook and he charged forward. His speed wasn\u2019t too fast, at the very least, it wasn\u2019t fast when compared to his usual speed!</p><br/><p>The stumpy elder sneered, \u201cSeeking death!\u201d At the same time, he took a step forward and unleashed his full speed as well. He had already decided that even if he was going to use a large cleaver to kill this little chicken before him, he would use all of his strength to take down this despicable servant in front of him. He wanted to use his most elegant martial techniques to give the little brat a heavy blow!</p><br/><p>Their two figures weaved together in the boundless snow as they launched their attacks against each other.</p><br/><p>Pa! A crisp sound echoed.</p><br/><p>He originally thought that the other party was like an egg attacking a rock, but the truth was that Ling Jian was like a rock attacking an egg!</p><br/><p>The stumpy elder held onto his right cheek and collapsed onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian landed on the ground in an elegant manner and with a snap of his right finger, cheers roared from all direction.</p><br/><p>Right before the two of them exchanged blows, Ling Jian suddenly sped up by two times at the very least. The stumpy elder was completely unable to react in time and was sent flying by Ling Jian\u2019s slap. Originally, even if this stumpy elder wasn\u2019t a match for Ling Jian, he shouldn\u2019t have been defeated in a single exchange. His defeat was completely due to the fact that he underestimated the enemy. If not for Ling Tian instructing Ling Jian to not harm the life of the Yu Family\u2019s elders, this stumpy elder would have been dead from that single mistake!</p><br/><p>Yu XiaoRan\u2019s expression was as dull as the dark clouds. Looking at Ling Jian\u2019s his eyes flashed with rage. He already understood that this so-called study attendant was feigning a pig to eat the tiger! The speed at which he took action was one that only a peerless expert would be able to display. Yu XiaoRan could still feel a lingering sense of fear when thinking about the speed that Ling Jian displayed! He suddenly turned to look at a green-dressed lady beside him, \u201cMay I ask Miss if this Ling Jian is truly young noble Ling Tian\u2019s study attendant?\u201d</p><br/><p>The green-dressed lady looked at Yu XiaoRan and as though she was stifling her laughter, she nodded her head and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, brother Jian is indeed young noble\u2019s personal study attendant. Who in the Ling Residence doesn\u2019t know about this? The information network of the Yu Family is world famous and you guys should be aware of this, right?\u201d The young lady was filled with disdain in her heart. Darn old fogey! You are actually thinking of fishing for information from me?! You must be blind! However, what she said wasn\u2019t a lie either. While Ling Jian had a status in the Courtyard only second to both Ling Tian and Ling Chen, he was indeed Ling Tian\u2019s study attendant in name. After all, Ling Jian felt that nothing could be a match for being Ling Tian\u2019s study attendant!</p><br/><p>Yu XiaoRan replied with an oh before saying in a distracted manner, \u201cWho would have thought that even young noble Ling Tian\u2019s study attendant would have such a high level of martial arts. Young noble Ling Tian is indeed surrounded by experts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs brother Jian\u2019s martial arts at a high level?\u201d the green-dressed lady asked with doubt. \u201cYoung noble is naturally surrounded by experts! However, the other guards only showed him face because he had grown up with young noble since he was young. Among the three hundred personal guards of young noble, brother Jian is nothing. If we really want to rank them, brother Jian would definitely be ranked at the very end.\u201d</p><br/><p>The weakest one?! The weakest one was actually able to win against an elder of the Colliding Heaven Pavilion?! Not to mention anyone else, even Yu XiaoRan himself wasn\u2019t confident of absolute victory if he took action. For there to be three hundred experts even more powerful than Ling Jian, could he be dreaming?! Yu XiaoRan felt his heart shake and his fingers trembled.</p><br/><p>The green-dressed lady looked around like a little lass who had made a mistake and stammered, \u201cErr\u2026 actually\u2026 all of that may not be true. All of these are the secrets of the Ling Family Courtyard and I have only heard rumors about them. You must not treat what I said as true. Ah ah ah\u2026\u201d After laughing dryly for a moment, the young lady then ran away to the side. At the same time, she almost burst out laughing as she thought, See how I scare all of you to death!</p><br/><p>This green-dressed lady was Shui QianRou\u2019s personal maid, Die\u2019er. The Shui and Yu Family were mortal enemies and now that she had the chance to tease them, how would she let it go to waste? She naturally bragged about the Ling Family\u2019s strength as much as she could! Seeing the look of shock on Yu XiaoRan\u2019s face, Die\u2019er was naturally overjoyed.</p><br/><p>Was Ling Tian\u2019s strength truly so unfathomable? Such an organization was just far too frightening! Yu XiaoRan\u2019s face was extremely dull. The look of fear in the little lass\u2019s eyes as though she was trying to cover something up had erased the last trace of doubt that Yu XiaoRan had.</p><br/><p>In the snow, the stumpy old man let out a roar and stood up. He looked as though he wanted to swallow Ling Jian alive as he wiped off a trace of blood from his lips, \u201cGood brat, you truly concealed yourself well. This old man underestimated you! However, you better not be delighted! From now on, you will not be able to take advantage of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian let out a long sigh and had a look of helplessness. \u201cI will admit that if we are going to fight with our lips, I will not be able to take advantage of you. If we are going to fight with the thickness of our skin, I would not be a match for you at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian looked at the stumpy old man with pity. \u201cYour attainments in these two areas are truly at the peak of perfection! I never expected that there would be someone with skin as thick as the city walls! My eyes have truly been opened today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are seeking death! Hand your life over!\u201d As he roared, he pounced forward with frustration. How would Ling Jian be afraid of him? Ling Jian charged forward as well, speeding up a notch, and a series of clashing sounds could be heard in the air. Following that, a figure like a round ball crashed down from the sky and rolled around in the snow. In just a short while, the figure had actually rolled a few rounds in the snow and turned into a huge snowball.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s figure then flashed in the sky and landed on the ground. He then revealed a bright smile and said, \u201cHow round.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a battle between experts, even the slightest bit of difference was like the difference of a thousand miles. Even though Ling Jian increased his speed only slightly, it was out of the stumpy elder\u2019s expectations again. How could he not experience defeat? He had once again lost to Ling Jian in a single blow!</p><br/><p>Yu XiaoRan snorted and his figure flashed out to stop the rolling snowball. With a simple palm, an odd human figure was revealed.</p><br/><p>The legs of the stumpy elder were locked behind his neck and his arms were curled around his ass. His head was inserted into his pants and his originally round figure looked completely like a ball at this moment. Even after his rolling figure was stopped, his ridiculous posture was still maintained.</p><br/><p>Yu XiaoRan\u2019s face turned ugly and after slapping the stumpy elder a couple of times, the stumpy elder regained his consciousness. While the stumpy elder did not suffer from any severe injuries, he was a respected figure in the Yu Family who had never suffered such humiliation in the past ten years. After regaining his consciousness, he spat out another mouthful of blood in anger, and then he fell unconscious again from anger.</p></div>\n</div>"}

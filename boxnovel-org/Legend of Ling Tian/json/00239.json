It slowly wormed its way into her thoughts, breaking her out of that mysterious reverie.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn exquisite and flawless portrait of mountains and rivers; and a set of severe sword techniques. I also sense a sort of mysterious cultivation technique, and also\u2026 an endless imposing manner. The artwork also contains your own line of thinking, as though your whole self had blended to become the artwork itself. This\u2026 what kind of realm is this in\u2026 Yu BingYan\u2019s eyes remained glued to the painting, her state of mind still trapped within it as she spoke dreamily.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you could infuse your martial arts into your painting\u2026 weaving all the knowledge of your martial arts into the painting, making up for your deficiencies in being unable to cultivate, what a wonderful thing that would be.\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s voice sounded like a wisp speaking to her, or perhaps an immortal voice descending from the heavens, burrowing deep into her subconsciousness, eliciting encouragement, desires\u2026 and hope!</p><br/><p>This was actually a heart sutra that Ling Tian was skilled in, the Music of the Dream Immortal! It closely resembled hypnosis, but was much more profound than just plain hypnotizing the victim! This method was created by Ling Tian through observing the psychological therapy processes as well as the art of hypnotism, and its purpose was mainly to elicit confessions from people! However, Ling Tian found out that this heart sutra had the convenient effect of being able to subtly influencing a person\u2019s thoughts, not just merely for confessions. As such, seeing Yu BingYan so lost in her own dreams, he decided to operate the skill and lend her a helping hand!</p><br/><p>As long as Yu BingYan really digested this concept, and discovered how to fully integrate her martial skills into painting, then Ling Tian had the confidence to push her to greater heights! He would allow her to separate herself from the painting, removing her obsession that was \u2018seeing the mountain as a mountain\u2019. Only then could she truly integrate her abilities, and open up a new path in the way of martial arts!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I could infuse martial techniques into art\u2026 infuse martial techniques into art\u2026\u201d Yu BingYan muttered to herself, her eyes still focused on Ling Tian\u2019s picture of the mountains and rivers. Her mental state was becoming more and more perplexed. In Yu BingYan\u2019s eyes, the painting seemed to have transformed into a sword dance, and she felt as though she had been enlightened on something, but at the same time it was still out of her grasp\u2026</p><br/><p>Even after a long while, silence still reigned in the study. Not a single sound could be heard!</p><br/><p>Knowing that Yu BingYan had already reached the crucial point, Ling Chen also silently stood by the window, not daring to make a squeak. She was not jealous of the prajna-like state of enlightenment that Yu BingYan was going through because she knew that as long as she wanted to learn, her young noble would pull out all the stops to make sure she mastered it!</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a groan came out of Yu BingYan\u2019s mouth, and her face turned pale as she lost consciousness. Luckily, she fell straight into Ling Tian, who had positioned himself behind her.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed bitterly to himself as it turned out that he was too impatient! While this lass had an iron will, her constitution was too weak and couldn\u2019t take the pressure, collapsing when she was one step away from success. However, she had already gotten a brief impression and the rest would depend on her hard work from now on. So long as she constantly recalled this feeling, one day she would definitely breakthrough the bottleneck!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang hurriedly went to the Yu Family\u2019s signature building, the Moon Climbing Star Picking Tower. In his hand he held a piece of paper, and this mental state was anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, Xue Leng from Sky Bearing has sent us news. Take a look, what should we do now? Are we really going to stand on the sidelines?\u201d Seeing Yu ManLou, he immediately spoke in an urgent tone.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was poised in front of the table, practicing his calligraphy. Every stroke was written slowly and meticulously, and he didn\u2019t even turn his head to address the speaker, saying, \u201cSecond brother, come and see; has my calligraphy improved over the past few days?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry, \u201cBig brother, there\u2019s a missive from Sky Bearing, it\u2019s important news!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without batting an eyelid, Yu ManLou merely replied, \u201cAnd what of it? Second brother, as a leader, one has to temper their will as well; not flinching even if a mountain collapses in front of him, and not batting an eyelid even at a sword rushing towards him! Your will still needs more tempering!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Yu ManTang knew that his elder brother was right, so left without a choice he could only sigh and sit down at the side in a depressed mood. However, he found out that he couldn\u2019t sit still, and started pacing around the room.</p><br/><p>A long time passed, at least an hour before Yu ManLou wrote his last word. He stood up in satisfaction, staring at his finished product with a smile, obviously pleased with his work.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother, what do you think of this set of calligraphy?\u201d Yu ManLou seemed to have carefully spoken out, but it perfectly interrupted Yu ManTang who was about to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, this\u2026 the strokes are vigorous and fascinating, how beautiful!\u201d Yu ManTang spouted some bullsh*t before diverting the topic, \u201cXue Leng sent a message\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn? You\u2019re such a spoilsport\u2026\u201d Yu ManLou only raised his eyebrows in response, finally sighing in resignation. Tossing his brush aside, he spoke with an indifferent attitude, \u201cSay it, what\u2019s it about? Why are you panicking over such small matters!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang finally let out a breath of relief, opening up the missive and reading out loud, \u201cXue Leng has delivered news, that Sky Bearing is now engulfed in a strange disturbance, one that they can\u2019t put a finger on. All the major powers have gathered there, but have all been suppressed by one person, and no one dares to move\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s eyebrows shot up instantly, \u201cLing Tian has finally shown his true colors? Displaying strength far above all others, creating a huge show of intimidation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother is a genius!\u201d Yu ManTang was thoroughly convinced by his brother\u2019s talent, \u201cThis is indeed so! We have no idea as to why Ling Tian would suddenly make a move, killing five men from the XiMen Family, with one of them being their youngest child, XiMen Zhang! The whole of Sky Bearing is now in shock, and according to Xue Leng, Ling Tian\u2019s ability isn\u2019t inferior to third brother! There are also rumors going around that Ling Tian is a successor for Beyond Heavens!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou laughed as he rapped as fingers on the table, \u201cThis makes more sense! If he had still remained hidden at this point, then I would be truly mistaken about him! Judging by the way he does things, he shouldn\u2019t be from Beyond Heavens; however, who could actually raise such a frightening character? This is the answer I most wish to know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leisurely returning back to his table, Yu ManLou continued, \u201cSince he devised a plan to lure all the major powers to Sky Bearing, then he definitely has a scheme! But if he appears as the silkpants noble he normally is, then no one would bother to pay attention to such a licentious person, even if he\u2019s the successor to the Ling Family of Sky Bearing! Thus, Ling Tian has to show off his influence! Throwing aside his previous image and showing the families how aggressive and tyrannical he is, only then could he suppress all the families! Only by doing so can he then proceed with the next part of his plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang couldn\u2019t help but be startled. In front of his brother, what he deemed as a heaven shaking event in Sky Bearing seemed to have already been totally anticipated by his brother. He couldn\u2019t help but let out a wry smile, feeling a burden lifting off his shoulders. He then continued reading out the rest of the contents of the letter.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeng\u2026deng\u2026deng,\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s fingers rapped against the tabletop as he sank into deep thought. \u201cThird brother wrecking havoc in Sky Bearing seems to be rude and impetuous but also seems to be part of Ling Tian\u2019s scheme. However, this has no disadvantage to us and can in fact be used to proclaim the influence of our family. This only has gains and not losses for us.\u201d Yu ManLou concluded leisurely, \u201cThe problem lies within Yu BingYan and Ling Tian\u2026\u201d At this, Yu ManLou sank into contemplation as he furrowed his brows.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang also furrowed his brows, saying, \u201cBig brother, I don\u2019t think this matter is appropriate!\u201d In the end, he only had this one daughter, so how could he calmly hand her over to Ling Tian? He immediately voiced his dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou chided him, \u201cWhat is inappropriate about it? This is a good thing, and we should put in all our efforts to make this happen!\u201d Yu ManLou paused to let out a sigh before continuing, \u201cSecond brother, I know your heart aches for your daughter, but how can I not have any heartache for her too? I have no daughter by my side to begin with, and in my heart, she is as good as my daughter! A pity that fortune does not favor her, afflicting her body with this incurable disease that can\u2019t be solved by any panaceas. She can\u2019t live for much longer, but to think that on her is such a heavy family burden! Right now, she has finally obtained some measure of happiness, so how could we not grant her that? This could be her last and greatest wish! Don\u2019t tell me, you are not willing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince big brother has put it that way, this young brother has no objections either.\u201d Upon digging up his heartaches, Yu ManTang only let out a long sigh and replied simply. The corners of his eyes already appeared wet as he continued, \u201cFulfilling her wish is also good, then she would not have been born without any purpose. Since big brother thinks so highly of that kid, then he\u2019s definitely suitable for Yan\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes flashed with a weird light as he laughed, \u201cThat is so!\u201d However, deep in his heart, he thought to himself, Yu BingYan can\u2019t survive much longer, and she could already be considered to have one foot in the grave! However, if she can complete her marriage vows with Ling Tian before attending the battle against the Water of Heavenly Wind, then Ling Tian will also become a target of the Shui Family! With such strength that he has displayed, he would create a nightmare for them, allowing our Yu Family to profit off it!</p><br/><p>When the time comes, the Yu Family can use the excuse of a duel to decimate half the forces of the Water of Heavenly Wind! While our forces will be reduced, it would not be a vital loss, and the death god that is Ling Tian could just swoop in to settle the rest of the problem! As long as the Yu Family aids him, the Shui Family might just end up annihilated! When the time comes, wouldn\u2019t the Yu family be left as the largest influential family in the whole of the three continents?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

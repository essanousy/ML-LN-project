He decided to ignore this matter temporarily as he continued flipping through the other files. As he flipped through it, he pointed out a few points for QianQian to record down. Ling Tian then let out a deep breath. If he wasn\u2019t wrong, those fellows from Above Heavens should be hiding in one of those places. The moment night arrives, the truth would be out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there news about DongFang JingLei?\u201d Ling Tian lifted up his teacup and asked calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the reports, after DongFang JingLei left the Northern Wei territory, he traveled towards the south-east and his current location should be in between the Xiao and DongFang Family\u2019s territory. However, his destination isn\u2019t clear and it doesn\u2019t seem like he intends to return to the DongFang Family. At the same time, it doesn\u2019t seem like he intends to visit the Xiao Family either. His actions are truly baffling.\u201d Beyond Ling Tian\u2019s expectations, QianQian was able to answer his question immediately without searching through any files.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian nodded his head. It was obvious to him that QianQian did indeed put in a great amount of effort in the area of collecting intelligence. He then praised her, \u201cGood job.\u201d</p><br/><p>As for why DongFang JingLei was behaving as such, Ling Tian was extremely clear in his heart. His words probably had a huge impact on this Second Master. As of now, DongFang JingLei was still stuck in a dilemma and unsure of the choice he should make. Ling Tian sneered in his heart as he thought, If that\u2019s the case, let me give you some additional pressure to see if you will submit obediently!</p><br/><p>Hearing Ling Tian\u2019s praise, QianQian\u2019s face flushed red and her heart began to thump rapidly as she lowered her head shyly.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then stood up and said, \u201cLet me give you an important mission. I want you to send someone to monitor all of DongFang JingLei\u2019s actions. As for the Bright Jade City, the situation is presently too tense and for safety reason, it is best for all of you to lay low for the time being. After all, I am present in the city, and I will be able to make adjustments if something were to happen. If you don\u2019t have my orders, you should wait for this storm to pass before continuing with your tasks. I will be leaving now. There isn\u2019t a need for you to send me off, lest we end up attracting attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes! This servant bids farewell to young noble.\u201d QianQian said with a depressed tone. After today, when will I be able to see him again? Young noble, you must take care!</p><br/><p>She then heard Ling Tian leave the pavilion as he reverted back to Zhao DaFu\u2019s hateful voice, saying something inaudible before leaving.</p><br/><p>QianQian\u2019s tears began to flow down yet again. The man who had appeared in her dreams countless of times had left. From the start to the end, she did not even see her young noble\u2019s true appearance!</p><br/><p>The biggest regret of her lifetime!</p><br/><p>However, this opportunity for her to spend some time alone with her young noble was enough to be engraved deeply within her heart\u2026</p><br/><p>Leaving the pavilion, Ling Tian felt a load off his shoulders. As that \u2018Little Guai\u2019 saw him, she actually let out a lovable \u2018hmph\u2019 and turned around to ignore him. She then shook that thick waist of hers and stomped her feet and a mini cyclone seemed to have been formed\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing that she ignored him, Ling Tian was overjoyed as he snuck away like a thief. Behind him, he then heard a high-pitched shriek, \u201cZhao DaFu, Zhao DaFu\u2026 Hmph! You better not come and find this lady again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian broke out into a cold sweat and sprinted for his life. Even in the face of the number one expert, Justice, Ling Tian was never this frightened\u2026</p><br/><p>Thinking about what would happen tonight, Ling Tian could not help but reveal a smile. Shui Family, Above Heavens\u2026 There was another reason why Ling Tian was in such a rush to find the experts of Above Heavens. Ling Tian wanted to know just how heavily injured Justice was from the battle he had with Above Heavens! Was he dead or alive? Were his injuries light or severe? How long would he need to recuperate? As long as he did not have his answer, Ling Tian would not be at ease. After all, Justice was the individual who possessed the largest threat to him.</p><br/><p>If Justice were to suddenly appear when he was occupied with something else, Ling Tian would truly be in huge trouble. Thus, Ling Tian\u2019s number one priority now would be to confirm this matter before making other plans.</p><br/><p>Of course, Ling Tian did not need to be concerned that Justice would suddenly appear now and he could freely carry out his scheme to pit the Yu Family against Above Heavens. After all, it would be in Ling Tian\u2019s best interest to weaken these two parties as much as possible. The strength of both parties had already exceeded Ling Tian\u2019s expectations, and Ling Tian had even fantasized about both the Yu Family and Above Heavens perishing in their fight\u2026</p><br/><p>Naturally, Ling Tian knew that it was no more than a pipe dream. It would be extremely difficult for him to ensure that both families suffered some losses in their fight, much less fighting each other to the death. Don\u2019t forget, the people heading these two powers were willy old foxes. How would they be willing to easily engage in an all-out fight?</p><br/><p>After going through his plan for tonight again, Ling Tian let out a satisfied smile. After obtaining the information that he wanted, it was naturally time for Ling Tian to go back and make his preparations. If he were to stay out for too long and allow someone to realize that he was an imposter, that definitely wouldn\u2019t be a good thing. While he wasn\u2019t afraid of being found out, Ling Jian was currently seriously injured and it wasn\u2019t the right time to create trouble.</p><br/><p>After passing by another street, Ling Tian suddenly heard fighting sounds. Ling Tian could not help but be curious as he thought, Could it be that there is another party who dares to go against Yu ManLou at such a moment? Since the source of the disturbance was one where he would have to pass by anyway, Ling Tian let out a smile and continued his journey.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of me! Why are you capturing me? What did I do? On what basis can you guys arrest anyone you want?!\u201d A sharp voice filled with anger and fear sounded! The fight had already ended and the person who had resisted capture had obviously been apprehended.</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian heard this voice, he was stunned for a moment because of the familiarity of the voice! A face then appeared in his head as he thought with doubt, Why would she appear here with her status? Furthermore, how could she be captured by the patrolling guards? How odd.</p><br/><p>Speeding up his steps, Ling Tian a squadron of twenty blue-dressed soldiers holding onto a skinny figure and walking towards another alley. The skinny figure was still struggling but to no avail.</p><br/><p>Seeing the figure struggle, the captain could not help but grow impatient as he slapped the skinny figure, \u201cIf you continue struggling, this daddy here will slaughter you right now!\u201d He then let out an \u2018eh\u2019 sound and sniffed his fingers. After which he let out a perverse chuckle, \u201cHow strange! Even though this brat\u2019s face is so tan, his face is actually so smooth! Could he be a lass in disguise?\u201d</p><br/><p>As that skinny figure heard that, she began to tremble with a look of extreme fear.</p><br/><p>The soldier was originally making a casual remark and did not mean what he said but upon seeing the nervous actions of the skinny figure he let out a malevolent sneer and ripped off the shirt of the skinny figure.</p><br/><p>With a ripping sound, the shirt on the skinny figure was ripped open, but because she was tied up by ropes, the clothes were not completely ripped off. Even if that was the case, all the soldiers present could not help but take in a breath of cold air. All of their eyes were opened up wide as they looked over lecherously with drool almost flowing down their mouths.</p><br/><p>Underneath the ripped shirt was actually a patch of snow white skin. On her chest, proud hills could be seen which was wrapped up tightly by bandages.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed a lass! This daddy here almost didn\u2019t notice that.\u201d The soldier began to cheer, \u201cDammit, we were dragged out from bed since last night and have been working for a full day and night. We can finally have some fun now! Let us find a nice place, and everyone will definitely have a share!\u201d</p><br/><p>The guards all let out a wave of cheers and there were even a few who let out wolf whistles. All of them could not control their lust, and the captain of the squadron lightly pinched the cheek of the lass. \u201cLittle girl, you are probably a young chick, right! Hahaha! Since you sent yourself to our doorstep, this daddy here will definitely allow you to have a good time. I will definitely make sure that you will never forget me even in your dreams\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That girl quickly turned around as tears of desperation flowed down her cheeks, \u201cScumbag! I will definitely not let you off even in death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t let me off? Hahaha\u2026\u201d That captain began to laugh sinisterly, \u201cYou will definitely beg me to not let you off. But that will be on the bed and under this daddy\u2019s body! Hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPei!\u201d That girl spat on his face and said hatefully, \u201cI would rather die than allow you bunch of beasts to have your way!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDie? Haha, do you think you can escape with death? Don\u2019t worry, this daddy will definitely let you die\u2026 however, you will be dying from pleasure. Hahaha\u2026\u201d That captain laughed lasciviously as he looked at the girl like a predator eyeing on his prey.</p><br/><p>\u201cScum! You will die a horrible death! I will not let you off even as a ghost!\u201d That girl scolded and with a violent struggle, she actually took a step forward and bit down on the right hand that the captain was using to stroke her cheeks. She bit down so hard to the point blood flowed down the corner of her lips.</p><br/><p>The captain gave out a miserable shriek and struggled to free his hand. By the time his hand was free from her teeth, it was completely bloodied and he winced in pain. In a fit of rage, he pulled out his blade and cursed with anger, \u201cYou actually dare to be so presumptuous in front of this daddy?! Dammit, this daddy will strip you naked and let you see my prowess!\u201d He then swung his blade and the rope tying the girl\u2019s chest was cut off. With a lecherous sneer, he grabbed onto her shirt and wanted to rip it apart!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

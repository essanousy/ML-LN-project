After all, it was still broad daylight and with the many servants and maids of the family, it would mean that Ling Tian\u2019s whereabouts would be easily exposed. Ling Tian decided that it would be best for him to wait until the night before visiting his mother and grandmother. After all, these few elders of his had been extremely worried about him. While others may not know of the prestigious Beyond Heavens, how could a character like Old Madam Ling not know? Even if she was extremely confident in her grandson, she was also apprehensive about Justice\u2019s strength. After these few months, her head was filled with much more white hair.</p><br/><p>Madam Chu Ting\u2019er had also feared for her son frequently during this period of time. Just as the old saying went, \u2018The mother worries when the son travels\u2019. Furthermore, Ling Tian was being chased by the number one expert in the world, Justice. How could Chu Ting\u2019er not be worried? On top of that, she did not dare to display her worries in front of her mother or father-in-law. After a few months, Chu Ting\u2019er was much frailer than before and as such, Ling Tian had no choice but to make a personal appearance to ease the worries of them both. With the wisdom and experience of his elders, it was impossible for them to reveal his whereabouts. The only one who would possibly reveal his whereabouts would be his father who didn\u2019t know how to keep his mouth shut. However, his father was currently not at home and was out in battle. In fact, of all his elders, General Ling Xiao was the one who was the least worried about Ling Tian. In Ling Xiao\u2019s words, \u2018This daddy has never seen that so-called Justice but this daddy knows that my son is capable of taking the head of the enemy\u2019s general while being surrounded by a million soldiers. If that Justice wants to chase after Ling Tian, he better not be frightened by Ling Tian instead!\u2019</p><br/><p>Thus, the first place where Ling Tian visited was the Ling Family Courtyard. He immediately instructed Ling Chen to hold an emergency meeting with the upper echelons of the Courtyard and gathered them all in a hall. While Ling Tian had paid attention to the happenings of the Courtyard via messenger falcons, it was impossible for everything to be written down on the notes and there was naturally a need for him to personally take a look at everything that had been going on in the Courtyard. At the same time, it was also for him to meet with all of his upper echelons to inform them of his safety and let them know that the main pillar of the Courtyard was back.</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe, Feng Mo and the rest did not know what this meeting was about and the moment they entered the secret chamber, they saw Ling Tian seated at the head of the table. They all could not help but be surprised followed by being overwhelmed with ecstasy! Amongst them all, Meng LiGe was undoubtedly the most surprised. Feng Mo and the others were all Ling Tian\u2019s trusted aides and had always thought of their young noble as an invincible existence. While they were shocked by the fact that Justice was able to force Ling Tian to leave Sky Bearing, they weren\u2019t too worried about Ling Tian\u2019s life. Together with the fact that Ling Tian sent them instructions regularly, they were all at ease!</p><br/><p>However, Meng LiGe was not just a famous strategist in the world but also a knowledgeable scholar. He knew what the Martial Order Medallion of Beyond Heavens signified and could not help but be worried for Ling Tian. Witnessing Ling Tian\u2019s safe return, he didn\u2019t know if he was glad about Ling Tian\u2019s safety or shocked that he could escape from Justice\u2019s hands!</p><br/><p>There weren\u2019t many people who were part of this meeting and only Ling Tian, Ling Chen, Ling Jian, Li Xue, Meng LiGe, and Feng Mo were present. Even Ling Six and the others in charge of collecting information weren\u2019t present in this meeting. However, the news that they had collected was all in Li Xue\u2019s hands. While there were only a few people present in this meeting, the members present were undoubtedly the true elites and core of the Courtyard!</p><br/><p>The most interesting thing was the fact that of the six of them, only Ling Tian\u2019s strength was made known to the world but the rest of them still remained in hiding. While Ling Jian was the infamous First Pavilion Head, there weren\u2019t many in the world who knew his real name. As for Ling Chen and Li Xue, the two of them were even more mysterious and apart from Ling Tian, there probably wasn\u2019t anyone else aware of their true strength. If one wanted to find another person who understood both their strengths, then it would probably be Justice who had the opportunity to exchange a few blows with both of them.</p><br/><p>The first discussion topic of the meeting was the recent military actions of the Ling Family Courtyard. With Ling Xiao and Shen RuHu leading 300,000 soldiers out to battle, it could be said that this was the first large-scale military campaign of the Ling Family. It was necessary for them to treat the matter seriously and if there was the slightest bit of error, their foundations could be damaged.</p><br/><p>Hearing Ling Tian questioning about the military affairs, Meng LiGe who was in charge of military affairs stroked his beard with a delighted grin, \u201cYoung noble had not returned previously but the matter of the NanGong Family ambushing Miss Chen could not be delayed. After a series of discussions, we decided to let General Ling send 200,000 soldiers down south. Up until now, while both parties are at a state of mutual hostility, the war has not begun. This was within our expectations and was also the outcome that we wanted to achieve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Li Ge revealed a crafty smile, \u201cYoung noble wasn\u2019t around after all and it wouldn\u2019t be good if the world really broke out into chaos. Before General Ling set off for battle, I invited Duke Ling to command General Ling to surround them but not attack, pressure them but not fight! In other words, oppress the enemy and create pressure but not fight them head-on. Regardless of how advantageous the battle situation is, they are not to start the battle! If not, they will be dealt with +</p><br/><p>the military law! They must delay until young noble returns to make a decision.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian almost spat out his mouthful of tea. Such a decision would probably make his father extremely frustrated. After all, for the number one general off the empire to be threatened with the military law, it would be impossible for him to not be frustrated! However, Meng LiGe was also extremely crafty and summoned his grandfather to be the one issuing the order. If not, there probably wouldn\u2019t be anyone in the world capable of suppressing his father!</p><br/><p>Meng Li Ge still displayed a scholarly elegance. \u201cAs for General Shen, I also issued the same instructions. For us to send out two separate troops, it is number one, to protect ourselves and be prepared to go to war with Southern Zheng, and number two, to test the waters. While we sent out our forces to two different locations, it isn\u2019t our true intention to start the war. Thus, the risk with our actions is low. At the same time, with such a large scale movement of our troops, all the other empires do not dare to take this matter lightly. Southern Zheng aside, even Eastern Zhao is also in chaos and the Xiao Family has split their forces into three. One group is led by General Xiao WuHen, a total of 150,000 soldiers setting up camp at Sunset River. It is only 150 miles away from Southern Zheng and they would be able to arrive with the snap of the fingers! This group is undoubtedly targeted at General Ling\u2019s 200,000 strong army! Another group of 150,000 soldiers is led by Xiao WuJu and has arrived at the Eastern Zhao borders. With Eastern Zhao as the divide, they are having a standoff with General Shen RuHu\u2019s forces. The final group also consists of 150,000 soldiers and is led by Xiao FengYang personally. They are currently 500 miles away from Sky Bearing and have also set up camp to lay in wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe seemed to have been exhausted from talking and paused for a sip of tea before continuing, \u201cCurrently, the situation is extremely clear and the Xiao Family\u2019s large-scale movement of their forces is obviously targeted at our Ling Family! The moment our forces make a move, the Xiao Family would definitely join forces with our enemy to wipe out our forces. At the same time, the third group would attack Sky Bearing and seize the foundations of our Ling Family! There are even signs of them working together with Eastern Zhao and Southern Zheng. If our original motive was to start a war with both Eastern Zhao and Southern Zheng, it would be impossible for us to turn back. However, even if that isn\u2019t our intention, the current situation isn\u2019t optimistic either.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing what Meng LiGe had said, Ling Tian focused his attention on the map. The positions and directions of the three Xiao armies had been marked out by Meng LiGe on the map with red arrows. After looking at the map, Ling Tian smiled and said with a hint of mockery in his voice, \u201cBeing able to mobilize 450,000 soldiers at once, the Xiao Family is truly the number one financial magnate. They truly think extremely highly of our Ling Family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ling Tian\u2019s casual tone and confident appearance, these individuals who had been extremely nervous for the past few days heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then knocked on the table with his finger and asked indifferently, \u201cHow are the Xiao armies receiving their supplies? The amount of food their soldiers and horses consume can\u2019t be small, right? How far away are we from the supply route of the Xiao armies? Is there anything that we can make use of?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe\u2019s eyes lit up and he quickly replied, \u201cThe first group is 600 miles away from the Xiao Family, the second group is 400 miles away from the Xiao Family and the third group is 1300 miles away from the Xiao Family. They received supplies from the cities along the way and there aren\u2019t many loopholes for us to exploit. The Xiao Family does indeed live up to the name of being the number one financial magnate. They are actually able to support three huge armies single-handedly without a single sign of struggle.\u201d While Meng LiGe didn\u2019t say much, the bright light in his eyes showed that he had understood Ling Tian\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian naturally noticed Meng LiGe\u2019s expression and asked, \u201cWhich group does Mister Meng think we should deal with first?\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe smiled mysteriously, \u201cIt is best to remain silent rather than take action. We can wait for news from the north and lay in wait. We can remain motionless to deal with the myriad of possible changes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed, \u201cMister is exceptional indeed. If that\u2019s the case, we shall follow Mister\u2019s plans and ignore them for a few days. It is just that Mister will be tired over the next few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe stroked his beard and smiled, \u201cIt is this subordinate\u2019s job. How will I feel tired?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled and looked at Li Xue. Before he could even ask her a question, Li Xue began speaking, \u201cThe Yu army had already confronted Western Han and they have fought three battles already. While Western Han suffered defeat in all three battles, their defenses are extremely tight. The Yu Family was only able to occupy two insignificant cities. They probably won\u2019t be able to take Western Han down anytime soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian nodded his head and asked with interest, \u201cWho is the general for the Western Han army?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue swept the information in her hands and said, \u201cIt is the old general Li ZongHan. He is the number one general of Western Han for the past thirty years. Before both the armies fought for the first time, Li ZongHan executed Han TieXuan and used his blood as a sacrifice for his flag. This matter caused a huge commotion back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLi ZongHan\u2026\u201d Ling Tian muttered that name under his breath and a glow could be seen in his eyes. It seems like XiMen Sa had exposed Han TieXuan. If not, with Han TieXuan\u2019s status as general of the Imperial Army, it would be impossible for Li ZongHan to kill him as a sacrifice for the flag. However, XiMen ChongTian did not go out to battle but Western Han chose to send Li ZongHan who is far past his prime. It seems like the Western Han imperial family is truly concerned about the rumors of the Yu and XiMen Family forming an alliance. It seems like XiMen Sa\u2019s action had a huge effect.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Second and Third Master of the Yu Family also arrived safely back at Bright Jade City,\u201d Li Xue continued.</p></div>\n</div>"}

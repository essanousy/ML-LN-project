The next moment, his offending hand had already followed the curves of her body to slip down south, ultimately landing on her soft and pert buttocks. As he applied some force in kneading, he grinned evilly, \u201cHow do you want me to look at you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026 how to look?\u201d Xiao YanXue was lost in dreamland, her brain already unable to process any rational thoughts. She was originally an innocent little girl who had not experienced any matters in this area, and to be mercilessly teased by Ling Tian in this way, all that was left in her mind was simply to fulfill all the desires of this person asking. There were no other thoughts that could be formed in her head.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian took the chance to strike while the iron was hot. Blowing a stream of warm air into her ear, Xiao YanXue felt her entire body shiver, her legs immediately tensing up while her supple waist wriggled within Ling Tian\u2019s embrace like a sinuous snake, inciting the desires of all who saw. She then heard Ling Tian whisper into her ear once again, \u201cHow would you want to let me look?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unable to resist Ling Tian\u2019s teasing, she incoherently sputtered out in the midst of her moans, \u201cYou\u2026 you can look however you wish to look\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Lowering his head, Ling Tian suddenly clasped his mouth onto one of her supple mounds, speaking in a muffled voice, \u201cI would like to see you\u2026 with your clothes off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue let out a shrill cry, as her body stiffened. Shortly after that, she threw herself to Ling Tian, hugging him tightly and biting onto his shoulder as she panted, \u201cUp\u2026 up to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the two of them tumbled around, looking as though the deed could be done at any moment, there was a \u2018putong\u2019 sound as they fell into the river. Unbeknownst to them, they had rolled to the riverbank and fell into the river together. With the shocking cold of the mountain spring water, Xiao YanXue was immediately woken from her reverie. Upon recalling her previous shameful actions, she screamed and immediately pushed away from Ling Tian\u2019s embrace, jumping out of the water like lightning and jumping straight into the tent, refusing to show her face.</p><br/><p>Having had his fantasy rejected, Ling Tian ruthlessly smacked the surface of the water, cursing with clenched teeth, \u201cDarned mountain spring! Darned pond!\u201d He let out a long breath, feeling extremely depressed.</p><br/><p>Looking at his clothes, wet for the third time today, Ling Tian could only let out a bitter laugh, reluctantly casting his eyes towards the tent flap in the distance before sighing. Having been c*ckblocked, he could only helplessly draw out the Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade in his bosom to scrutinize. Looking at it, he was unknowingly reminded of Yu BingYan and Ling Chen. If only they were here\u2026 how good would it be? At least they would be able to comfort this young master, who had been suppressed non-stop for the past few days!</p><br/><p>The corners of Ling Tian\u2019s mouth curled into a hint of a smile. Before this, he had not accepted Xiao YanXue, and thus was not moved by her flirting or actions, controlling his desires and thoughts. However, after he was injured, upon knowing how Xiao YanXue had taken care of him despite him being incapacitated, his heartstrings were unknowingly tugged at!</p><br/><p>Since the heartstrings had already been plucked, for them to soothe back now was a truly difficult task.</p><br/><p>However, why did he have to do so?!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was deeply aware of how bad his wounds actually were when he sank into unconsciousness! This was added on to the fact that he was filthy from rolling on the mud after he landed back on the ground. Furthermore, there were also impurities which had been purged out from his meridians, and they were unbearably disgusting! However, Xiao YanXue did not even think twice, choosing to care for his wounds without the slightest shred of hesitation. Furthermore, in order to lessen his pain to the minimum, she had chosen to use her own mouth, slowly clearing off all the dirt and filth on his body, then applying the medicine. This whole process had taken her more than four hours!</p><br/><p>The adorable her never knew that Ling Tian\u2019s body had already been diagnosed and treated by Justice, and the remaining injuries, while terrifying, were actually superficial wounds not capable of lasting harm to him. However, it could have been that his superficial wounds were too frightening, resulting in Xiao YanXue taking action. Ling Tian had even gone to the trouble of counting while he was \u2018unconscious\u2019, the number of times Xiao YanXue could not bear the filth and vomited, but each time she still doggedly returned to continue her task. Such patience, such tenderness! There was no thought of giving up coming from her!</p><br/><p>Just how many women in the whole wide world would be able to carry out such a task for their loved ones? Maybe Ling Chen would have done it, but other than her and a sparse few others, who would still be willing to do so? Ling Tian had even asked himself honestly, when faced with this sort of woman with this sort of deep love for him, could he actually be so heartless as to forsake her? If he did so, then Xiao YanXue would be destroyed emotionally and mentally!</p><br/><p>Could it be that he, Ling Tian, with the ambition to be above the heavens, would actually stumble and fail to protect a lady that loved him so? If it was about family feuds, then what about Yu BingYan? Wasn\u2019t he enemies with her entire family? Was there any difference now? Was it just because she wanted to annul the betrothal when they were 5 years old? At that time, she was just a little lass who was unaware of anything! Furthermore, wasn\u2019t that whole operation part of his manipulation from the start?</p><br/><p>So long as there was the prerequisite that he would accept her and that she had affirmed her feelings for him, then Xiao YanXue would no longer be the little princess of the Xiao Family but rather another identity, that of Ling Tian\u2019s woman! As for the Xiao Family, what else could they do? Could it be that Ling Tian himself could not even give his woman the minimum for her happiness?</p><br/><p>As such, Ling Tian had come to this conclusion and did not bother to be so guarded around Xiao YanXue anymore. This was because, within his eyes, she was already considered his woman, someone whom he approved off wholeheartedly!</p><br/><p>A thousand reasons, ten thousand excuses, all of them were not important! The previous one sentence was enough to explain everything!</p><br/><p>As such, Ling Tian was clear in his conscience!</p><br/><p>Thinking up to this point, Ling Tian suddenly felt immensely carefree.</p><br/><p>What has the muddled and confused world got to do with me? So long as my heart is stable and anchored, let the waves come towards me!</p><br/><p>With unrestrained laughter, Ling Tian plunged into the mountain spring, sinking down as he activated his cultivation, simulating the internal breathing of the XianTian realm. Nestled at the bottom of the creek, his entire bearing let out a contented aura.</p><br/><p>With a flip of his hand, the Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade from Yu BingYan was brought in front of his eyes. In the bottom of the creek, with the rays of light shining down from above, Ling Tian suddenly discovered that his surroundings had taken on a hue similar to that of the jade pendant in his hands. It was as though the water had become crystalline and pure without flaws, just like jade itself!</p><br/><p>It was truly deserving of its name as the Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade!</p><br/><p>What a mystical treasure jade this was!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had once heard the saying that for the highest grade of jades, they would turn the bowl of water the same color if submerged and if light was shone on it. However, this small piece of jade could actually turn more than ten feet of its surroundings into a jade-like color?! How many bowls of water was that? Such a piece of jade, could it really be the legendary jade heart, only found in the depths of water after tens of thousands of years?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian secretly exclaimed to himself, What a priceless treasure! He began to feel the heartache over shattering the other piece of jade. Suddenly, he sensed the sunlight on top of him fading, and looked up to see two tiny black dots situated in the middle of the Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade. However, they did nothing to impair the flawless beauty of the jade.</p><br/><p>Upon bringing the jade closer to him, Ling Tian found out that surprisingly, the two black dots would disappear. However, placing it further away from him, the dots would mysteriously reappear\u2026 Could it be that this was the heaven shaking secret behind the jades? The reason why the Yu and the Shui Family waged their millennium-long war?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s expression grew grave as he started to ponder furiously. After a long while, he finally clenched his teeth and decided to test it out. No matter how precious a treasure was, if it did not serve a purpose, it was no better than just a mere plaything! Ling Tian brought the jade to the crown of his head, and revolving his internal energy, sent a needle-like strand to infuse slowly into the jade.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, the moment the energy touched the surface of the jade, it was sucked in without obstruction by the jade itself, as though a thirsty traveler in the desert might do when he saw water. The jade itself remained warm to the touch, unchanged, without any signs of shattering.</p><br/><p>With this encouragement, Ling Tian began to increase his output, first by two times, then double, and double again\u2026 The entire jade pendant began to release rays of light underwater, turning more than thirty to forty feet of the pool into an emerald green color, the color of the jade! Furthermore, this color seemed to be on the verge of increasing in density\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s eyes were trained directly on the jade, as his fingers that were clasped onto it continuously fed energy to it. The brilliance of the jade pendant grew ever brighter, to the point that even gazing at it brought pain to one\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>He could finally observe, that within the central location of the jade, the two hexagonal shaped black dots were actually slowly moving, as though trying to meet each other. Their speed was agonizingly slow, to the point that if one did not open their eyes wide and stare, they would have missed out on this tiny action done by them.</p><br/><p>However, one of the black dots gave him a sense of deja vu\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian snapped out of his reverie, realizing that one of the black dots was, in fact, the exact same one that flew out when he had shattered the jade pendant belonging to the Shui Family! It was no wonder that he could not find it, for it had already burrowed into this jade. The only question he had unanswered was about how could this dot actually burrow its way into the jade, without leaving any flaws of any sort?</p><br/><p>Was this not too strange and magical?!</p><br/><p>By now, Ling Tian had already spent an hour sitting inside the creek, infusing his internal energy into the jade. Sixty whole minutes! No matter how deep and profound Ling Tian\u2019s internal energy was, he was beginning to be unable to withstand this drain. However, he did not dare to let go, nor did he dare to go out. Who knew if the jade would only showcase such a scene during certain special circumstances? If he floated back up, and the jade regained its original self, then would it not be a waste of his efforts?</p><br/><p>This was in the best case scenario. What would happen if this was a serendipitous chance, that would not happen anymore even if he tried? As such, Ling Tian could only grin and bear it.</p><br/><p>Time slowly slipped by, and the two black dots began to shift ever so close to each other. The expenditure of Ling Tian\u2019s internal energy naturally increased, and the color of the jade deepened without end, already dyeing the entire waters around it in a deep emerald green. Without any wind or movement inside the water, it resembled a flawless jade from afar, refracting off rays of light when the sun shone down on it. What an imposing spectacle!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

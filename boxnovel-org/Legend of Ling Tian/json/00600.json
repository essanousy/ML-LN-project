He then turned around, appeared in front of an injured soldier, and began his rescue operation.</p><br/><p>The originally closed doors of the Ling Family Courtyard suddenly opened and numerous cavalry charged towards the Lei Family army with a maniacal battle cry.</p><br/><p>Ling Three and Li Lin of the Violent Wind Gang charged in with a red cloth tied on their heads. Behind them were their gang members who were dressed in all kinds of color while they shouted at the top of their lungs. On the other side, it was a bunch of individuals covered in black soot and carrying large steel hammers. They were Ling Five and his eight hundred blacksmiths. While they were not proficient in martial arts, after waving their hammers every day, their strength wasn\u2019t to be underestimated. The moment they clashed with the Lei Family warriors, a large number of casualties were created.</p><br/><p>The troops in the middle were the most special. There were men and women, old men and young ladies. However, all of them were luxuriously dressed. The young lady in the lead was the Tower Head of the Smoky Thea Tower, Gu XiYan. To her left and right were her Senior Uncles. In the face of this brutal battlefield, a weak looking lady like Gu XiYan had actually exploded forth with a killing intent that most violent and burly men could not even compare to!</p><br/><p>Li Xue and Ling Jian were like two tanks crashing into a small roadside village. The two martial arts expert started their massacre of the Lei Family warriors who had already fought for a full night!</p><br/><p>Under the powerful deterrence of Justice, while the Lei Family warriors knew that the upper echelons of the Ling Family Courtyard were right behind him and no longer had the ability to defend themselves, not a single person dared to attempt to attack them.</p><br/><p>Such a dangerous battlefield with such an intense battle, an extremely odd scene unfolded because of the presence of a single individual!</p><br/><p>He was the number one expert in the world! Martial Order Medallion owner, Justice!</p><br/><p>That thin sword scar that he carved out was akin to the towering mountains and a line of life and death! Anyone who wanted to pass it had to pay the price of his life. Perhaps Justice wouldn\u2019t be able to block everyone who crossed the line. Perhaps they would be able to succeed as long as they tried but a mountain of corpses would definitely be the result. Everyone wanted to be the lucky successor but none of them wanted to be the corpse on the ground. At the very least, they did not wish to be the first.</p><br/><p>Despite having the absolute advantage, none of them dared to charge towards the weak enemy troops!</p><br/><p>All of them would rather risk their lives to engage in an intense battle with the reinforcements. They would rather fight Ling Jian, Li Xue, or even Ling Tian\u2026</p><br/><p>Almost everyone did the exact same thing, which was to turn around and pounce towards the incoming Ling Family reinforcements.</p><br/><p>In Justice\u2019s eyes, a tinge of mockery could be seen and he looked at the Lei Family warriors as though he was like a proud divine dragon looking down on a herd of sheep on the ground. It was filled with naked disdain!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s figure drifted around in a carefree manner despite being attacked by three experts. At the same time, he did not forget to cheer, \u201cMartial Order Medallion owner, truly the number one expert in the world! How majestic!\u201d He then added on after thinking for a while, \u201cLike a king of ants facing an army of ant soldiers. He truly has the disposition of a king.\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice who was currently treating the injured was hopping mad.</p><br/><p>When he heard the first half of Ling Tian\u2019s words, he was still pretty pleased with it. As for the second half\u2026 are those even human words? Everyone knew that ants only had a queen and they were the ones who gave birth to the offspring. As for the male ant, their only use was to mate with the queen\u2026</p><br/><p>Justice\u2019s hands which were actively treating injuries were no longer stable. This was something that had never happened in the past few decades! Good brat, I took action to save your subordinates but you mocked me in such a manner. This daddy will definitely teach your ass a good lesson later! Just you wait!</p><br/><p>Li Xue who was full of killing intent and slaughtering her enemies far off had almost dropped her sword from laughter\u2026</p><br/><p>Justice\u2019s depression did not persist for a long time because there was actually someone who dared to charge towards him!</p><br/><p>Who would be the first sacrificial lamb?!</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenPeng had been smacked flying by a single slap from Justice and only managed to recover after rolling on the ground in misery for a long while. Only then did he realize that half his teeth were already gone. Recalling the previous scene, he immediately erupted in fury and humiliation!</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenPeng let out a roar of extreme rage. Jumping up from the ground, he led his 500 soldiers and charged at Justice like a mad bull.</p><br/><p>Kill Justice to wash away his humiliation! Lei ZhenPeng had truly gone mad. When he was back home, he was a figure who could cause the mountains to shake with just a casual word. How would he be able to bear with such humiliation? So what if he was the Martial Order Medallion owner? So what if he was the number one expert in the world? He would rather be killed than humiliated!</p><br/><p>Second Master Lei who was full of rage had met with Justice who was at the peak of his frustration.</p><br/><p>Seeing Lei ZhenPeng charge over with his soldiers, Justice remained unperturbed and calmly finished the treatment of a soldier before standing up with his hands behind his back. All of this was done exactly at the moment when Lei ZhenPeng\u2019s first soldier crossed the line that Justice drew! A black light burst forth from Justice\u2019s figure and the black light was even darker than darkness! The dark light shot at the Lei Family warriors in an almost miraculous manner and a full seventeen heads fell off from their necks! Without even turning behind to face the Lei Family warriors, he waved his hand and a long sword light shot out like a cyclone. The more than thirty Lei Family warriors who were part of the second group were all cleaved into two segments without exception! Before the Lei Family warriors could even let out a groan or shriek, Justice raised his palm up as though it was a blade and began his massacre of the third line of Lei Family troops!</p><br/><p>By the time Justice appeared in front of Lei ZhenPeng with a swoosh, almost 80 Lei Family warriors had already been reduced to a bloody mess.</p><br/><p>Just when the look of fear surfaced on Lei ZhenPeng\u2019s face and before he could even have any thoughts, he saw Justice\u2019s palms turn into a boundless mountain smashing down onto him from above. At the same time, the powerful palm winds covered all possible routes of retreat for Lei ZhenPeng!</p><br/><p>A few dull thuds sounded and Lei ZhenPeng\u2019s burly figure was compressed into a small meatball and sent flying.</p><br/><p>Under Justice\u2019s relentless attacks which were almost a way for him to vent his anger, Lei ZhenPeng did not even have the time to react and was reduced to a ball of mush. The soldiers behind Lei ZhenPeng all stopped in complete unison as they witnessed the scene unfolding before their eyes. They then squatted down and began retching!</p><br/><p>From far off, Lei ZhenTian\u2019s devastated roar could be heard. He had already seen the miserable death of his second brother. Despite him giving way to Justice time and time again, Justice had actually attacked in such a ruthless manner\u2026</p><br/><p>As the battle continued, after Ling Three, Ling Five and Gu XiYan charged into the Courtyard, more and more reinforcements flooded into the Courtyard from the nearby towns. While they weren\u2019t absolute elites they had the advantage of numbers! The battle gradually began tilting in the Ling Family\u2019s favor.</p><br/><p>As all of the Lei Family warriors fought, they would sneak a glance at their family head. Why wasn\u2019t their family head issuing a retreat order yet? There was no longer a meaning for this \u2018ambush\u2019 to continue already. If the battle was to continue, they would probably be wiped out completely.</p><br/><p>However, how would they know that Lei ZhenTian no longer had the choice of retreat\u2026</p><br/><p>His son had first died a miserable death before his second brother was killed. His plan was completely obstructed and the fate of the Ling Family had completely turned around after the appearance of Ling Tian. All of the sudden changes pushed Lei ZhenTian to the brink of madness! He was still waiting for his three Deacons to arrive so that they could join hands with him to kill the Ling Family\u2019s mastermind, Ling Tian. After battling with Ling Tian for a while, Lei ZhenTian could clearly feel that Ling Tian, who was less than 20 years old, had martial arts above his! Even if he were to join hands with two Elders, they may not be a match for him. Only if four people worked together could they have some hope of victory\u2026</p><br/><p>Following the myriad changes on the battlefield, Lei ZhenTian suddenly witnessed a sight which truly drove him to hopelessness. The heads of his three Deacons had been cleaved off and were hung up on a tall bamboo pole. As Lei ZhenTian saw the three heads, he felt as though the whole world had collapsed!</p><br/><p>All of the experts that he had brought out from the Moon Deity Empire, apart the two elders fighting with him plus a couple of others, were all dead! Furthermore, the few other experts who were trapped in chaotic battle also didn\u2019t seem optimistic\u2026</p><br/><p>The Lei Family was finished!</p><br/><p>The Lei Family was finished!</p><br/><p>These words surfaced over and over again in Lei ZhenTian\u2019s head like thunder. Lei ZhenTian suddenly felt his whole head go into a daze as though there was a blazing sun right above his head shining its brilliant rays on him. Lei ZhenTian suddenly felt as though he was far away from the battlefield\u2026 as though his whole soul had been extracted from his body\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d A black ball flew towards him and without a second thought, Lei ZhenTian smacked it to the side with his palm. Taking a good look at it, Lei ZhenTian\u2019s eyes widened in shock: It was the head of his fourth brother, Lei ZhenYu! The head rolled on the floor for a couple of meters before being trampled by the many soldiers\u2026</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian\u2019s body began trembling\u2026</p><br/><p>A mocking laugh sounded by his ears and another two \u2018peng\u2019 sounds could be heard. A skinny elder who was working together with Lei ZhenTian suffered from two palm strikes by Ling Tian and his body drifted in the sky like a kite with a snapped string. Lei ZhenTian could clearly see that there was a large crater in the chest of the elder\u2026 all of his ribs had been smashed into mush from Ling Tian\u2019s two palm strikes\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

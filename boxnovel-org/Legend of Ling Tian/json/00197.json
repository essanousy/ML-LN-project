Dammit!\u201d As Third Master Yu saw the last two phrases, he flew into a rage immediately, \u201cXue Leng, pack up immediately when we return. We will move to this darn Smoky Thea Tower. Regardless of what they are scheming, will this daddy here be afraid? We are the heroes and valiant knights of the pugilistic world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xue Leng and Xue Fei looked at each other without making a single sound. Looking at the red cloth, they both knew that things wouldn\u2019t end well. With the explosive temper of their Third Master, he would be set off by the smallest thing. As long as he saw the sign, he would definitely move into the Smoke Thea Tower, even if he knew that he would lose his head in the night! With only Third Master Yu being present, it was akin to the monkey ruling the cave when the tiger is absent! While the little princess was present, she was obviously unable to persuade Third Master Yu. The both of them could not help but sigh in their hearts!</p><br/><p>My dear family head, of all people, why did you have to send this ancestor to Sky Bearing? If we allow him to continue to do as he pleases, someone will die for sure! This Third Master is the best at creating trouble and is a complete troublemaker!</p><br/><p>With a stomach full of anger and excitement from his victories, Third Master Yu gallantly rushed to the inn where the NanGong Family was staying. Without a second thought, he kicked the door down and charged in! Then, he flew into an outrage like a tiger among a flock of sheep.</p><br/><p>NanGong TianHu, who had an equally explosive temper, also jumped out in rage. Like two mad bulls, they ran amok in the inn, causing NanGong TianLong, who was in hiding, to change his hiding place three times!</p><br/><p>The face-off between the two of them was like heavenly lightning meeting earthly flames, with the sound of their clashing fists ringing throughout the whole inn. At the very end, both of them only attacked without guarding, taking turns punching each other. The two top-notch experts acted completely like street ruffians tangled in a fist fight.</p><br/><p>After a full hour, victory and defeat finally became obvious. NanGong TianHu lay on the floor with bruises all over and his robes in tatters, panting heavily with his eyes still filled with a crazed fighting intent. However, he could no longer get back up.</p><br/><p>As for Third Master Yu, he was still as steady as a mountain and bursting out with laughter. However, his whole face was filled with bruises, with swelling all over his head, and his silk robes had been transformed into beggar\u2019s rags. A bruise could be seen on the corner of his lips, and even breathing would make him feel pain. However, a look of excitement and satisfaction could be seen on his face!</p><br/><p>Such a battle was completely to the liking of Third Master Yu. Even when he left, he still looked at NanGong TianHu with a trace of reluctance.</p><br/><p>That night, Ling Tian lay in bed thinking about the things that had happened today. His mood was a complete mess, and he didn\u2019t have a clue as to how he could start organizing his thoughts. The gentle moonlight crept into the room silently, with the sky being filled with the dreamy white light. Ling Chen was curled up in his embrace like an obedient kitten, deep in her dreams. Her jade-like arms wrapped around Ling Tian\u2019s neck tightly with a sweet and blessed look on her face.</p><br/><p>My plan to let Third Master Yu fight all the four main families shouldn\u2019t be too bad, right? Even if the Yu Family\u2019s head knows about this, he will probably agree with me!</p><br/><p>In life, for everything that is gained, something must be lost. When Ling Tian used Yu ManTian to suppress the various powers, he also pushed the Yu Family\u2019s prestige to the peak at the same time!</p><br/><p>The Yu Family did indeed live up to their reputation of being the number one great family! A random martial arts fanatic, Third Master Yu, was actually able to defeat all the top-notch experts of the various powers, leaving them without the chance to fight back at all! After tonight, this thought would permeate into the hearts of all the heroes in the continent. The prestige of the Yu Family would definitely rise up another notch after what went on today. This was something that Ling Tian didn\u2019t want to see happen!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian had no choice but to do this. First, with the various powers gathered in Sky Bearing, the situation was extremely delicate. Every single power was beginning to get restless as they all had been thinking that they were number one in the world. Furthermore, the ties between the great families were complicated with many years of accumulated grudges. If Ling Tian didn\u2019t suppress them from the start to keep them in their place, they would inevitably break out into chaos. As long as two parties started a battle, the already highly-charged atmosphere would definitely break out into the flames of conflict. If that happened there would certainly be no turning back. Thus, Ling Tian had to weaken all of their strengths to a state where it was within his control! Finally, Ling Tian also needed a party to attract the attention of everyone. The number three figure in the Yu Family, Yu ManTian, was without a doubt the most suitable person!</p><br/><p>After Yu ManTian created so much trouble, the pride of all the so-called \u2018number one\u2019 experts would definitely be kept under control. As long as Yu ManTian stayed in the Sky Bearing City, none of them would dare act with unbridled aggression! At the very least, they would no longer be as unrestrained as before.</p><br/><p>Another benefit was the fact that Ling Tian gained a rough understanding of the strengths of the different families. The only pity was the fact that he failed to witness the fight with the XiMen Family because he had to comfort Yu BingYan. Ling Tian was extremely curious about what kind of a person would have such an \u2018eye-catching\u2019 name!</p><br/><p>After showing off his invincible might, Third Master Yu was naturally extremely delighted and had come over to find Ling Tian for a celebration. Actually, the celebration was just an excuse, and the real reason was his desire for good wine. After a few rounds of drinking, Old Madam Ling, Duke Ling and Ling Zhan also rushed over to exchange pleasantries with Yu ManTian before leaving. When they left, they instructed Ling Tian to prepare himself as they were going to enter the palace for a celebratory banquet because Consort LingRan was pregnant again.</p><br/><p>Hearing this piece of \u2018good\u2019 news, Ling Tian was stunned for a moment. This piece of news reminded Ling Tian that his aunt was in the imperial family of the Sky Bearing Empire. In his future plans, he would definitely end up harming Ling Ran, Princess JiaoYue, and this unborn baby. Just what should he do? Choose his family? His own ambitions? This was an extremely difficult decision!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shut his eyes and let out a long sigh. After a long while, he finally decided to not think about it anymore for the moment. Things will definitely turn out fine in the end. Why do I have to worry so much about it now?</p><br/><p>Just when he was about to fall asleep, a thought suddenly surfaced in his mind and he couldn\u2019t help but be startled. Ling Tian was suddenly reminded about how he was drugged before he was born. As a mere successor of the Ling Family, he already had met with such treatment. With his aunt carrying the Emperor\u2019s son, would she also face something like that?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian knew that his aunt\u2019s greatest regret was the lack of a son. Now that she was pregnant, she would definitely place all of her hopes with this child. If someone were to come up with a scheme and cause her to lose her child, Ling Ran would suffer a devastating blow! With Ling Ran\u2019s personality, she probably wouldn\u2019t be able to endure the trauma!</p><br/><p>I must definitely visit the palace soon, Ling Tian thought to himself as he shut his eyes.</p><br/><p>The next morning at dawn, Yu ManTian, who had gotten drunk again, didn\u2019t dare wait for Ling Tian to visit him with fragrant wine. As soon as the sun was up, he rushed the Xue brothers to pack up their things and move to the Smoky Thea Tower. With him being the number one hero in the Sky Bearing City, he was thinking that he must definitely pay a visit to the Smoky Thea Tower!</p><br/><p>Helpless, Xue Leng could only accompany Yu ManTian to the Smoky Thea Tower after seeking instructions from Yu BingYan. However, since Yu BingYan\u2019s identity was not publicized yet. Thus, she made use of this fact to stay at the Ling residence.</p><br/><p>At the front of the group was the spirited and energetic Third Master Yu. At the back were the glum-looking guards of the Yu Family. As for the female guards, they naturally stayed with Yu BingYan at the Ling residence. The male guards were all assigned to Yu ManTian, making them all extremely displeased.</p><br/><p>However, no one expected the fact that the first family to move to the Smoky Thea Tower wasn\u2019t the Yu Family, but the NanGong Family! This made Yu ManTian extremely depressed, almost wanting to find NanGong TianHu for another battle!</p><br/><p>After the battle yesterday, the NanGong family received news of the Smoky Thea Tower inviting all the heroes of the continent, with opinions of those from the NanGong Family being divided. But right at that moment, NanGong Yu said, \u201cSince the Smoky Thea Tower dares to invite all the heroes of the continent, there definitely won\u2019t be any problems. If something happens, the Smoky Thea Tower and the whole Sky Bearing Empire would definitely suffer attacks from the whole continent! At that time, no empire or family, including the Yu Family, would be able to stop the joint revenge of the various powers! With the Smoky Thea Tower being so provocative, Yu ManTian from the Yu Family will definitely lose his cool and be the first to move in. As long as he moves in, all other powers will definitely move in as well, for fear of looking weak. If we end up being the last to move in, we will definitely be belittled by the others. Since no one else has moved in yet, why don\u2019t we take the chance and be the first ones? At that time, we will be able to make our NanGong Family stand out from the crowd!</p><br/><p>NanGong TianLong raised his thumb up in praise and agreed with this idea. So the NanGong Family actually moved into the Smoky Thea Tower that evening. Even the heavily injured NanGong TianHu forced himself to walk into the Smoky Thea Tower. Even though Yu ManTian rushed to move into the Smoky Thea Tower, he still ended up in second place.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

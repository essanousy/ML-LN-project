All of them were shocked by the outcome of the battle before them and looked forward to the 100 man battle after this. Thus, the departure of the two individuals did not alert anyone.</p><br/><p>Under a large tree far away, Justice\u2019s hands were placed behind his back with Shui WuBo\u2019s body leaning against the tree. His appearance and bearing were just like when he was alive. Even if he left his life without any regrets, the current scene was extremely desolate.</p><br/><p>Seeing the arrival of Ling Tian and Ling Jian, Justice\u2019s eyes glowed with excitement as he sized up Ling Tian from head to toe. However, he did not say anything but picked up Shui WuBo\u2019s body instead. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the place to talk. Follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Their three figures sped away without saying another word. The movement techniques of these three individuals were truly spectacular. In just a short instant, the three of them had easily traversed past a few mountains and entered a mysterious valley. Justice placed Shui WuBo\u2019s body down and allowed Shui WuBo\u2019s body to be positioned in a cross-legged manner. He wasn\u2019t willing to let the corpse of this martial arts powerhouse lie down on the ground.</p><br/><p>Just from this point alone, it could be seen how much Justice respected the martial arts fanatic Shui WuBo!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at Shui WuBo\u2019s corpse with respect in his eyes. Of course, he didn\u2019t respect Shui WuBo\u2019s martial arts or character but Shui WuBo\u2019s stubbornness towards martial arts and the way he treated death with complete ease!</p><br/><p>This was not something that any individual would be able to do!</p><br/><p>Justice looked at Ling Tian calmly and smiled, \u201cI truly never imagined that you would make such a shocking breakthrough in just a few days! The sheer speed of your advancement truly leaves me in shock!\u201d</p><br/><p>While he said that he was filled with shock, not a tinge of shock could even be seen on his face. He was only rubbing his palms in excitement. The faster Ling Tian raised his strength the better. He could not be bothered with how Ling Tian raised his strength! The only important thing was for Ling Tian to grow stronger!</p><br/><p>However, he was also truly filled with surprise. After all, Justice had never seen or heard of anyone achieving such rapid growth in strength. Since he understood that such an advancement speed was unheard of, he did not want to find out the truth behind it. He knew that finding out the truth would only affect the calmness of his heart and wasn\u2019t anything beneficial to him!</p><br/><p>At his level, what he cultivated wasn\u2019t martial arts but mental state and his realm!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled slightly. \u201cHowever, this isn\u2019t the time for us to fight. At least, this isn\u2019t the best time for us to fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice burst out laughing, \u201cThat\u2019s right, this isn\u2019t the best time for our battle indeed. However, this seat is no longer lonely from now on. With you as my companion, it would be a difficult thing for me to feel lonely even if I wanted to!\u201d As he spoke, his eyes burned with passion and excitement. \u201cI am truly looking forward to the battle between us! I have been looking forward to such a battle for a full ten years! The loneliness that I felt for the past ten years was truly torture! Thankfully I still have you! It was only a wish in the past but this wish of mine has finally come true! I am truly overjoyed!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was speechless. To a peerless grandmaster like Justice who had been alone at the peak of the martial arts realm for a couple of decades, after finding an expert capable of being a match for him, that joy was something that could not be described.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could understand Justice\u2019s feelings and so he waited silently.</p><br/><p>After the trace of joy flashed past his face, Justice quickly regained his cool. Looking at Shui WuBo\u2019s corpse, he said, \u201cI cannot tell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven you cannot tell?\u201d Ling Tian was truly surprised! At this moment, Ling Tian truly understood just how frightening the poison truly was! Furthermore, it was extremely odd and rare!</p><br/><p>Apart from being a peerless martial arts grandmaster, Justice was also a grandmaster in the art of the medicine. Even after living for two lifetimes, he had only seen two or three individuals who were a match for Justice. Furthermore, these individuals were the medicinal deities from his previous life and it was impossible for anyone in this world to be a match for them. With regards to the different poisons in this world, there would probably be no one more familiar than Justice. Especially such venomous martial arts which combined such a poison with one\u2019s inner qi! However, Justice was unable to see through the origins of Yu ManLou\u2019s martial arts! With Justice being unable to see through the origins of such venomous martial arts, it was all the more baffling!</p><br/><p>Just which kind of poison would be so sharp and frightening?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face became solemn. After a long while, he asked, \u201cIf we cannot tell from the surface, we may be able to tell if we open up his body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice immediately interrupted with displeasure, \u201cShui WuBo was a rare expert in the world today and had already seen through the essence of the sword way. Now that such an expert has died, how can we tarnish his body? Such an action would be no different from being a beast! I do not agree!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a bitter laugh. Justice\u2019s thoughts were something that he had already expected. If he had another choice, he wouldn\u2019t want to do so either!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian knew that his words would definitely result in such an outcome. This wasn\u2019t the Earth from his previous life where an autopsy would be conducted on the corpse. In this world, the corpse of the dead was sacred, not to mention the corpse of a powerhouse.</p><br/><p>Even if one tortured the living, regardless of how cruel the means, he would be labeled as vicious or brutal at the very most. But if an individual defiles the dead, unless there was a sea of enmity between the two, no one would agree with such an action! Even though Justice wasn\u2019t trapped within the secular affairs of the world, he was also trapped in the traditions of the world!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian pondered for a moment as he carefully crafted his words, \u201cSenior Justice, for such an odd situation to occur on the battlefield, it is obvious that Yu ManLou had already unleashed his vicious means! With senior\u2019s medicinal skills, it should be obvious that Shui WuBo\u2019s palms are completely unharmed without any signs of it being pierced by weapons or hidden weapons. When Yu ManLou and Shui WuBo\u2019s palms contacted each other, I could obviously see Shui WuBo\u2019s palm bulging up for a moment before a thin black line quickly shot up his meridians. In that instant, Shui WuBo lost the ability to fight back. If not for him achieving a breakthrough in that instant, he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to unleash that final sword strike of his. The sharpness and viciousness of Yu ManLou\u2019s venomous martial art are truly difficult to defend against!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice listened by the side quietly. He was opposite Shui WuBo during the fight and he could not see these little details.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that Shui WuBo had died such an odd death, it can be said that Shui WuBo did not die a knowing death! The origin of this is Yu ManLou\u2019s venomous martial art! I am certain that this venom of his would render any martial artist helpless, regardless of how profound his cultivation was! The moment one suffers from such a venom, he would definitely be at the mercy of Yu ManLou. Both you and I wouldn\u2019t be an exception!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we can find such a venom, it would also be considered giving Shui WuBo an answer! Even if he is dead, we have to let him die a knowing death. Furthermore, if we do not understand Yu ManLou\u2019s means, Justice, let me ask you, in the world today, who else will be worthy of Yu ManLou using such means to deal with?\u201d Ling Tian let out a smile and pointed at Justice and himself, \u201cApart from you, it would be me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to be like Shui WuBo? Dying a mysterious death in the hands of Yu ManLou?\u201d Ling Tian asked.</p><br/><p>Justice\u2019s frowned slightly and said, \u201cIf he is still alive, we would be able to investigate the venom. But since he is dead already, how can we investigate anything? Even if we cut him apart, what can we find? We would only be able to tell that he was poisoned to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know how to perform an autopsy. Let me cut him open, I believe that I will be able to find out his cause of death. I believe that this would be Senior Shui WuBo\u2019s wish as well!\u201d Ling Tian said with confidence.</p><br/><p>Justice paused for a moment as he looked at Ling Tian. With a sigh, he placed his arms behind his back and gave his tacit approval.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian bowed down thrice in front of Shui WuBo\u2019s corpse. Raising his head up, he saw Justice\u2019s hand behind his back looking as though he wasn\u2019t willing to take part in the dissection process and could not help but glance at Justice with disdain. Justice obviously wanted to know what was going on but was feigning his demeanor. However, he did not delay matters and pulled out his sword to get to work.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Ling Tian let out a roar. Following that, he quickly took a step back and pulled Justice and Ling Jian back to retreat a hundred feet away!</p><br/><p>Before Justice and Ling Jian realized what was going on, an unbelievable scene unfolded before their eyes.</p><br/><p>In Shui WuBo\u2019s body, a soft bang could be heard as though something had burst. Following that, a black ball of mist could be seen rising from Shui WuBo\u2019s chest. The black mist rapidly expanded and covered Shui WuBo\u2019s body before disappearing without a trace.</p><br/><p>This was not the most frightening thing. As the black mist disappeared, Shui WuBo\u2019s body could be seen melting down. In just a short few moments, Shui WuBo\u2019s body was reduced to a puddle of black water that seeped into the ground. The floral and fauna in the surrounding fifty feet had withered to death in that short instant.</p><br/><p>Fifty feet around Shui WuBo\u2019s body had been transformed into a complete domain of death! The three of them could not help but feel a chill run down their spine and their heads being filled with cold sweat!</p><br/><p>When Ling Tian was cutting open Shui WuBo\u2019s chest, Ling Tian realized that Shui WuBo\u2019s heart was abnormally swollen. The moment the heart was exposed to air, it expanded rapidly like a balloon. Knowing that something was wrong, Ling Tian immediately pulled Justice and Ling Jian back rapidly and escaped from the calamity!</p><br/><p>If Ling Tian had been slightly slower and was tainted by the black gas\u2026</p><br/><p>Justice\u2019s face was also extremely ugly. Thinking about how he had held Shui WuBo\u2019s body for such a long journey, if Shui WuBo\u2019s body were to explode when he was carrying it, then\u2026 this Martial Order Medallion owner would probably become one with the mountains.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face was ashen and his face was filled with cold sweat, \u201cHow tyrannical! How vicious! How evil!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice was thoroughly enraged as he gnashed his teeth, \u201cYu ManLou actually dares to cultivate such a demonic martial art?! His actions truly go against the heavens and earth! This seat here shall chase after him immediately to put him down with my sword! I will not allow him to remain living in the world to harm anyone else!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d Ling Tian hurriedly stopped Justice, \u201cIf my estimates are right, it would be too late for Senior to go over now. Yu ManLou would not remain there waiting for you. You were the one who brought Shui WuBo\u2019s body away and as an individual who cultivates an evil martial art, how would he not understand the risks involved? I believe that it would be pointless for you to go over at this moment. He may already be on the way back to Heavenly Star.\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice was truly filled with hatred.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian asked, \u201cIt seems like you already know the origins of this martial art?\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice nodded his head with an ashen face, \u201cThat\u2019s right, after seeing the changes in Shui WuBo\u2019s body, I remembered something. According to the records of my Beyond Heavens, an extremely evil demon once appeared a thousand years ago. Anyone who suffered a blow from him would be reduced to a puddle of blood water in a few moments. Regardless of how high one\u2019s martial arts was or how profound one\u2019s cultivation was, it was impossible to escape such a fate! At that time, everyone lived in absolute fear and trepidation. In the end, the entire martial world gathered together to wipe out the demon together. The third generation Martial Order Medallion owner from my sect had also participated in the expedition to wipe out the demon before finally executing the demon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter his death, that evil martial art of his had never appeared again and I thought that this evil martial art was already lost. I never imagined that it would be in the hands of the Yu Family! Furthermore, it appeared again in Yu ManLou\u2019s hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian asked with curiosity, \u201cThen, what kind of a venomous martial art is this? How is it cultivated?\u201d</p><br/><p>Talking about this, Justice\u2019s face turned even uglier, \u201cIt is truly difficult to fully describe in words how venomous this martial art is. This venom has no antidote and it can be called \u2018death qi\u2019. As for the cultivation method, it is extremely brutal! It would be to raise a thousand children less than ten years of age and feed them venom from young. Every month, the amount of venom fed to them would be increased. Every 500 children would form a batch and after ten years, the first batch of children would be drowned. Their blood must not be leaked and the death qi on the corpses would be absorbed with a special incantation. After this batch of 500 children was absorbed, it would be a small accomplishment for the venomous martial arts. However, it was still insufficient to harm anyone and another ten years would be required for the venom to be assimilated within one\u2019s body. After that, it would be time for the second batch of 500 children to be absorbed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would require a full 20 years of effort for this venomous art to achieve accomplishment! Ling Tian, as long as one cultivates this venomous martial art, even if he has never practiced any form of martial arts, he would be able to kill experts at our level without us even knowing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice truly gnashed his teeth in anger and hatred. No matter what, Yu ManLou was the Family Head of a prestigious aristocratic family in the world and Justice never imagined that Yu ManLou would secretly cultivate such an evil martial art!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, is there any way to guard against this martial art?\u201d Ling Tian frowned and felt his stomach churning with the urge to vomit!</p><br/><p>He never imagined that the elegant looking Yu ManLou with a scholarly disposition would actually cultivate such a disgusting martial art! This was a vicious martial art that would enrage the heavens! Ling Tian could not help but be overwhelmed with killing intent!</p><br/><p>\u201cThere isn\u2019t an antidote for this venomous martial art! There is no way to save an individual from this venom! There isn\u2019t a way to defend against it! However, the way to deal with him is also extremely simple. The third generation Martial Order Medallion owner of my sect used this method to kill the demon with a single blow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A trace of joy could be seen on Ling Tian\u2019s face, \u201cSince there is a way, can Senior Justice enlighten me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Justice let out a bitter laugh. \u201cWhile the method is extremely simple, it is also extremely difficult: It would be to kill Yu ManLou before he can unleash this evil art of his! Kill him so swiftly that he would not have the chance to unleash his demonic art. This would be the most effective method. No spiritual elixir or divine art would be able to deal with this demonic art!\u201d Justice said calmly.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could not help but be dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Justice\u2019s method could be easily summarized: one hit KO!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian also let out a bitter laugh in response. This method was truly simple and effective but as the Family Head of the Yu Family, he held authority in his hands and was the commander of a million soldiers with countless experts by his side. With Yu ManLou\u2019s martial arts attainment, it was extremely difficult to even approach him without him noticing! Who would be able to kill him before he is able to even react? Who would be capable of such a feat?</p><br/><p>This was a task that was impossible to accomplish! Could Justice accomplish such a task? Could he do it?!</p><br/><p>Unless they could mimic the method in the past and entrap Yu ManLou in a situation where he was alone. If they sacrificed five or six experts to surround Justice, either he or Justice could hide by the side to deal the killing blow to Yu ManLou when he was flustered. That was the only way to kill Yu ManLou with a single blow!</p><br/><p>However, the experts surrounding Yu ManLou would face certain death!</p><br/><p>If they fought in a head-on battle, Yu ManLou definitely wouldn\u2019t be a match for Justice. However, the moment he unleashes his demonic martial art, regardless of whether he was facing Justice or Ling Tian, the outcome would definitely be both parties ending in mutual death!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet us head to the pier!\u201d Ling Tian immediately made his decision!</p><br/><p>\u201cTo the pier?\u201d Ling Jian and Justice were both puzzled. Didn\u2019t Ling Tian just say that Yu ManLou may already be on the boat back to Heavenly Star?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Ling Tian said anxiously, \u201cI didn\u2019t recognize the seriousness of this affair previously and was afraid that Senior would unleash a massacre. At that time, too many people would end up dead. However, it seems like even if we have to wipe out all of the Yu Family members in Heavenly Wind, we will have to stop Yu ManLou from returning to Heavenly Star. It won\u2019t be easy for us to find Yu ManLou\u2019s whereabouts but there is a path that he must definitely pass if he wants to return to Heavenly Star. He must definitely go to the pier if he wants to take a boat back to Heavenly Star. As long as he has not departed from Heavenly Wind, we would be able to block him! Now that he unleashed his venomous art on Shui WuBo, I dare gamble that he would not be able to use it again in the short term. In any case, this may be our last chance! The last chance for us to kill him without paying a huge price!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Ling Jian and Justice agreed in unison and the three of them shot towards the pier.</p><br/><p>Three strong gusts of wind sped towards the pier only to helplessly realize that a large boat had already transformed into a little black dot out at sea\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

All of the events and people of his past surfaced before his eyes.</p><br/><p>Everything that happened in the past was like a dream and the winds of today were extremely chilly!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou let out a long sigh as he chuckled. Just what is wrong with me? It is said that the old will always slip into the memories of their past. Could it be that I am becoming old already?</p><br/><p>No! I am not old yet! I am still filled with energy! I still want to rule over the entire world! The glory of the Yu Family will spread over the three continents from my generation onward and last another thousand generations! The goal of my ancestors will be fulfilled by me! I, Yu ManLou, will personally destroy Water of Heavenly Wind!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou had the urge to let out a long roar towards the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cReporting to Family Head, we can see a black dot far ahead and it must be the pier.\u201d A Yu Family warrior dressed as a sailor reported respectfully to Yu ManLou.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes remained shut as he replied in an indifferent tone. While he was looking forward to his visit to Heavenly Wind, he did not want anyone to guess his thoughts. After all, in the eyes of his Yu Family, he was always the mysterious figure up above.</p><br/><p>The boat sailed along with the wind and the scenery in front of Yu ManLou overlapped with those in his memories as they got nearer and nearer to him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSiii\u2026.\u201d Yu ManLou could clearly hear a few gasps of shock coming from the boat and could not help but be startled. Could something have happened? Yu ManLou tried his best to maintain his cool and ignore the commotion that was going on below but the gasping sounds of shock grew louder and louder. Finally, Yu ManLou could not help but look over.</p><br/><p>The moment he took a glance, Yu ManLou could not help but be startled as well. What was going on?!</p><br/><p>As their boat approached the pier, everything on land could be clearly seen. The pier was currently filled with people and everyone was packed like sardines along the coastline.</p><br/><p>From afar, the people at the pier seemed to have been split into three different groups. The group in the middle had a large flag raised high up on the pole. The \u2018Shui\u2019 word was written on it as the flag fluttered in the winds. On their left was another large flag with the words \u2018HuangFu\u2019 written on it. On their right was a flag with the word \u2018Song\u2019.</p><br/><p>Behind the three flags were countless warriors standing silently and waiting. They were obviously the elites of the three families. With a slight estimation, there would be a few thousand people present at the very least! While there were many people there, all of their faces were solemn as they stood silently. The only thing that could be heard was the gushing wind and their fluttering flags. A solemn atmosphere would naturally be created and the three groups looked as though they were ready to do battle!</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this far too odd? Could it be that the three great families of Heavenly Wind were about to join hands to face the Yu Family?!</p><br/><p>A few black-robed experts walked out from the cabin of the boat and stood behind Yu ManLou. They obviously heard the commotion on the outside and came out to see what was going on.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith our Yu Family\u2019s heavenly prestige, our name would be spread far and wide. With Family Head making a personal appearance in Heavenly Wind, how can the three largest families in Heavenly Wind not come out to give you some face? They must have all naturally come out to welcome you. For us to follow behind Family Head, we can also bask in your glory!\u201d An old man with a pointed mouth and cheeks like a monkey began flattering Yu ManLou before he even understood what was going on.</p><br/><p>The moment these words left the lips of the old man, the others beside him looked as though they were about to puke. They stealthily took a few steps back, distancing themselves from the old man. Anyone with half a brain would be able to tell the battle intent being emanated from the warriors on the shore. If not for the old man\u2019s skills of flattery reaching the pinnacle, it would be impossible to say such words without batting an eyelid. They truly did not understand why their Family Head had to bring such a character to Heavenly Wind. Standing beside him, the rest of them felt as though their worth was being degraded. With his mental state, how was it possible for him to even cultivate to such a level?</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome us? I think not.\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes narrowed and his beard drifted in his wind with a solemn expression, \u201cThe opponent\u2019s lineup is too large and they are obviously emanating dense killing and battle intent. While I do not know their intention behind gathering here, they definitely do not have good intentions.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man beside Yu ManLou looked at the pier and said with worry on his face, \u201cFamily Head is right. The opposing party is emanating enmity and they look as though they will draw their weapons the moment we have some disagreement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf only the Shui Family was emanating enmity towards us, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising. However, the three biggest families in Heavenly Wind are currently gathered together on the pier. Just what is going on with the other two families? Even if the Shui Family enticed the HuangFu and Song Families with benefits, it would be impossible for them to put in so much effort and challenge our Yu Family. I believe that there must be another reason for their presence.\u201d Yu ManLou revealed a carefree smile as though he could not be bothered with the huge army on the pier.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if they are emanating enmity towards us? In the world today, how many would dare to provoke the prestige of our Yu Family? How many would be a match for our Family Head? Even if the three families join hands with each other, they may not be able to endure a single strike from Family Head! As long as Family Head is here, all of us will not have any worries.\u201d The pointed-mouth old man chuckled and began flattering Yu ManLou again. Looking at the arrogant look on Yu ManLou\u2019s face, he naturally understood what Yu ManLou was thinking about. His words were completely in line with Yu ManLou\u2019s heroic spirit. His level of flattery had truly been polished to complete perfection.</p><br/><p>Even though the rest of them were disdainful towards the pointed-mouth old man\u2019s words and were cursing him for being shameless, they had no choice but to helplessly agree in front of the Family Head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be impossible for the three families to join hands and no matter how shameless the Shui Family is, they would never resort to that.\u201d Yu ManLou chuckled and he was obviously in a good mood. \u201cRegardless of what the reason is, we will understand when we land on the pier. At that time, we can just play it by ear and we don\u2019t need to make wild guesses now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Family Head is truly wise and has great foresight. Family Head is a heroic individual and naturally has everything within your grasp. This subordinate is truly convinced and the rock in my heart is also finally lifted up,\u201d the pointed-mouth old man said respectfully.</p><br/><p>The old men beside Yu ManLou had terrible expressions on their faces. Some of them covered their mouths as they gagged and others rolled their eyes with disdain.</p><br/><p>The boat gradually reached the pier.</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong, the Shui Family Head, welcomed Yu ManLou with a bright smile on his face and Yu ManLou walked over quickly with an amiable smile on his face. Both of them looked as though they were best friends who had not seen each other for a long time. If the people by the side did not know the relationship and identities of these two individuals, they would definitely think that they were a pair of brothers who had been separated for ten years finally being reunited.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Shui!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of them shook each other\u2019s hand passionately and laughed out merrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Yu, it has been many years since our last parting and brother Yu\u2019s appearance did not change much. In fact, you even look younger than before. I heard that you recently took in a new concubine. This little brother is truly filled with envy.\u201d Shui ManKong looked at Yu ManLou with a sincere expression as though all of his words were from the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo no no, brother Shui is the one who is still as elegant as always. You still look the same as the past and your cultivation must have taken a huge step forward and reached the peak of martial arts. This little brother is the one who is in admiration.\u201d Yu ManLou said with reminiscing in his voice, \u201cBack then, both of us brothers would drink together and talk through the night. Unknowingly, a full thirty years have passed! All of these years, this little brother truly misses brother Shui and hoped that I would be able to meet brother Shui again. Our meeting today truly makes me elated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLikewise, likewise. This foolish brother feels the same way too. Time flies like an arrow. For me to have the chance to meet brother Yu again in this lifetime of mine, the heavens truly treat me well.\u201d Shui ManKong laughed heartily and continued, \u201cBrother Yu, come come come, let this little brother introduce two friends to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>These two individuals who probably wished for the death of the other party were actually able to put up such an act. Regardless of whether it was their expression or tone, they looked extremely natural and not a single flaw could be seen. This made all of the Yu and Shui Family experts praise their family heads in their heart.</p><br/><p>The family head is truly the family head. How many people in the world would be able to have such a bearing and forbearance? Jade of Heavenly Star and Water of Heavenly Wind truly live up to the name of being a thousand-year-old family.</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong then raised his hands up and gestured, \u201cThis is the famous family head HuangFu of Heavenly Wind, HuangFu YanHan. Brother HuangFu has always been looking forward to seeing you. This is the Song family head, Song TianQiao, brother Song.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou replied with a smile and cupped fists, \u201cI have long heard of both of your great names.\u201d</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan cupped his fists with a fake smile, \u201cFamily Head Yu? I have long heard of your great name. I heard that Family Head Yu just took in a new concubine last year. Family Head Yu is truly filled with energy despite your old age and you are truly an example to those in my generation. I should have made a personal visit to congratulate you but was unable to do so because of the distance. I hope that Family Head Yu would forgive me and I will prepare a large gift for you later.\u201d His words were laced with sarcasm and he was obviously implying that Yu ManLou was an old lecher. Besides, would someone present a gift for such an occasion?</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou was taken aback for a moment as he thought in his heart. We belong to two different continents and while my Yu Family may be a little tyrannical, we definitely did not offend you. I wonder what do you mean by taking the initiative to provoke me as such? With dissatisfaction in his heart, Yu ManLou\u2019s reply became barbed, \u201cNo no no, I heard that Family Head HuangFu focused all of your energy into analyzing martial arts and stopped touching ladies a long time ago. After so many years, Family Head HuangFu is still able to remain chaste and this mental will of yours is truly admirable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d HuangFu YanHan\u2019s lips began trembling in anger. He married at a young age and engaged in excessive debauchery. In less than ten years, he already had sons and daughters. However, from that time on, he was no longer able to get it up and this matter was the biggest humiliation and secret in his life. However, Yu ManLou had actually said it in public at this moment. He did not know that Yu ManLou was only making a casual remark and thought that Yu ManLou was intentionally revealing his scar in public. How could he not be frustrated? Yu ManLou was still unaware that he had already formed an irreconcilable hatred with the HuangFu Family. Even if the kidnappings could be proven to be unrelated to the Yu Family in future, it would be completely useless\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head Yu,\u201d Song TianQiao stood forward and said with a detestable tone, \u201cI have long heard of Family Head Yu\u2019s peerless martial arts, strict discipline methods, and powerful army. However, it is truly out of our expectations that Family Head Yu is also interested in my Song Family. For Family Head Yu to treat my Song Family with such respect, Song TianQiao is truly honored.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ah, the Song Family is a large family and Family Head Song\u2019s leadership is fabulous. I have always been filled with respect for the Song Family.\u201d Yu ManLou replied courteously. At the same time, he could not help but be puzzled in his heart. While Yu ManLou\u2019s words seemed like ordinary courtesy words, in the ears of the confused, it was a completely different flavor.</p><br/><p>Even if Yu ManLou\u2019s wisdom was as high as the heavens, he was completely bewildered at this moment. Just what was going on with these two fellows? No matter what, the two of them are also the head of a large family and they should not be acting in such a manner! I came to Heavenly Wind from afar and even if you guys are dissatisfied with me, you guys should still remain courteous on the surface at the very least. Why are you two filled with gunpowder? How did I provoke you?</p><br/><p>If it was only a single person suddenly going crazy, it was still within reason. However, it couldn\u2019t be that the two family heads took the wrong medicine at the same time right? Furthermore, these two individuals were characters of weight in the Heavenly Wind Continent!</p><br/><p>How would Yu ManLou know that these two family heads spent their past few days in torture? The mysterious gift that they received every day would make them almost faint from heartache and they still had to keep their cool and not act rashly. The moment they met the \u2018culprit\u2019 of the event, how would they be able to exercise any restraint? They hated the fact that they could not pounce forward to swallow Yu ManLou alive. How would they still treat him with courtesy?</p><br/><p>Talking to Yu ManLou peacefully without summoning all of their forces to battle was already the limit for HuangFu YanHan and Song TianQiao.</p><br/><p>As Yu ManLou\u2019s gaze swept past the people before him, he was getting more and more confused by the minute. Both the family heads looked as though their eyes were burning with anger as though he was their greatest enemy. The warriors behind them were also glaring at him with killing intent in their eyes and rage all over their face. As for the Shui Family Head, Shui ManKong, he would look at Yu ManLou with a bright smile on his face as though he was laughing at Yu ManLou\u2019s misery. Just\u2026 just what was going on?</p><br/><p>Just when he was pondering over just what had happened, HuangFu YanHan and Song TianQiao could no longer suppress their anger. With their children suffering in the hands of another, how would they be in the mood to put up a hypocritical front in front of Yu ManLou?</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan said with a frosty look, \u201cFamily Head Yu, it seems like you do not intend to open your mouth if we do not take the initiative. Since things have developed to such an extent, why don\u2019t we just speak with each other openly? When does Family Head Yu intend to release my sons? What does the Yu Family have planned? Just tell us your conditions!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute\u2026\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s face turned dark as he looked at HuangFu YanHan. \u201cThis Yu doesn\u2019t understand what Family Head HuangFu means. What do you mean by \u2018since things have already developed to such an extent\u2019? Since when did this Yu take your son? Family Head HuangFu, for you to use such a ridiculous claim to make things difficult for this Yu, what do you mean by that? Do you think that I, Yu ManLou, am easily bullied?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYu ManLou! Why are you still feigning ignorance?! What is the point for you to continue denying the matter? What kind of a Yu Family Head are you?!\u201d Song TianQiao flew into a rage and exploded with anger, \u201cAre you just a coward who do not dare to admit your deeds?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPreposterous!\u201d Behind Yu ManLou, a skinny elder roared and took a step forward to teach the b*st*rd who dared to humiliate their Family Head a lesson.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou raised his arm to stop his subordinate from making a rash move. He could clearly feel that he had been pulled into a large and frightening scheme. As for the target of the scheme, it would probably be him or his entire Yu family. Looking at the situation before him, the children of the Song and HuangFu Families must have been abducted and the party who abducted them had framed him.</p><br/><p>This matter is truly strange.</p><br/><p>After taking a long boat ride for more than ten days and finally arriving at Heavenly Wind, they met such an incident the moment they set foot on land!</p><br/><p>\u201cMay the two family heads remain calm and we can talk things through slowly.\u201d Yu ManLou said with a calm tone, \u201cFirst, this Yu has just reached Heavenly Wind and has not even gotten off the boat. How would I have the ability to abduct your children? Second, if this Yu was truly the culprit, do you think I would allow all of you to suspect me? Do you guys think that I am a fool? The mastermind behind this incident obviously hopes for the world to break out into chaos and frame this Yu in the process, killing three birds with a single stone. For the two Family Heads to demand an explanation from me just because of the suspicions in your hearts, isn\u2019t that a great joke? Let me ask you two a question. If the Yu Family breaks out in battle with your two families because of this, who would be the one to benefit the most?!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he mentioned the matter of him being framed, Yu ManLou\u2019s gaze swept past Shui ManKong discreetly. If someone was trying to frame him, the smiling tiger in front of him would definitely be the most suspicious!</p><br/><p>Shui ManKong looked at Yu ManLou\u2019s gaze and tone and knew that Yu ManLou was suspecting him and even had the intention to point the spearhead towards him. Taking a step forward, he explained everything that happened to Yu ManLou.</p><br/><p>In truth, Shui ManKong did not suspect Yu ManLou from the beginning to the end. Yu ManLou was here at Heavenly Wind to battle his Shui Family and provoking the Song and HuangFu Families at this time would mean increased pressure for him. Even if he wanted to do so, he would only do so after the battle between them. Besides, the strength of the Yu Family seemed to be at its peak of the past thousand years. If the Sky Alliance truly belonged to the Yu Family, their Shui Family would not have the strength to even fight the Yu Family. As such, it was impossible for Yu ManLou to be the culprit.</p><br/><p>\u201cSky Alliance\u2026\u201d Yu ManLou muttered those words under his breath and a flash of enlightenment flashed past his head quickly before it disappeared. A long while later, Yu ManLou turned to look at HuangFu YanHan and Song TianQiao. \u201cA man will not be afraid to admit his deeds! If I truly did it, I wouldn\u2019t be afraid to admit it but this Yu is definitely not behind this matter. That Sky Alliance is definitely not a subordinate of my Yu Family. If the two of you are certain that this Yu is the mastermind and want to find your sons from me, it wouldn\u2019t matter either. Regardless of what you two want to do, this Yu will just accept it!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then turned around and said slowly, \u201cBut when the truth of the matter is out, the two of you will have to pay for the decision that you make today! While Jade of Heavenly Star isn\u2019t a large family, there isn\u2019t anyone in the world who dares to speak to me in such a manner!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou said these words slowly and a dense killing intent spread across the air. The powerful pressure of this peerless expert filled the whole pier.</p></div>\n</div>"}

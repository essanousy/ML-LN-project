Even if the Xiao Family still held 3,000 miles of fertile land, they lost 450,000 soldiers and were no longer a cause for concern.</p><br/><p>Besides that, the flood had blocked the southeast and it was impossible to enter or exit.</p><br/><p>The Ling Family army had already majestically approached the east and those with a discerning sight could tell that the Ling Family would definitely take over the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass the moment the flood waters retreated. The Xiao Family which was heavily injured no longer had the chance to seize back the Heavenly Water Ravine Pass!</p><br/><p>The Ling Family army was like a new rising star and their rise was unstoppable. They had the right to look down on the entire world with pride and they were the strongest force on the continent! Even the Yu Family that had been around for a thousand years didn\u2019t seem comparable to the Ling Family\u2026</p><br/><p>During this period of time, the Yu Family army had also launched their expedition towards the southwest. They besieged the city gates and forced the Western Han to continuous retreat. Finally, after the new Family Head, XiMen Sa, fought a bitter battle at the city gates and realized that the Yu Family truly could not be blocked, he opened the city gates and essentially surrendered.</p><br/><p>Just a day before that, Family Head XiMen Sa had still made a vicious vow that he would live and perish with the Western Han imperial family. However, XiMen Sa had actually acted in such a b*st*rdly manner and let the Yu Family army into the city without the slightest bit of preparation. When the whole city was taken over by the Yu Family, the poor Western Han monarch was still shouting out with all of his strength, \u201cQuickly inform the XiMen Family Head to save us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>During this day, the XiMen Family also announced the death of their old Family Head. XiMen WuYi who was beaten up by Ling Tian to the point that he turned into a vegetable finally did not need to lead a senseless life. He could finally leave in peace and enter the afterlife\u2026</p><br/><p>To the XiMen Family who had a huge merit, the Yu Family displayed huge benevolence towards them. While Family Head Yu ManLou did not personally arrive to pay his respects to the late XiMen WuYi, they sent the general in charge of this battle and an elder with an extremely prestigious status to pay their respects. XiMen WuYi was the family head of the XiMen Family after all. With thousands of people present at his funeral, it could be considered a great honor to him.</p><br/><p>With XiMen Sa\u2019s aid, the Yu Family quickly pacified the few resistances within Western Han and successfully incorporated the Western Han army into their own. They then quickly organized their forces and led their forces to their next target: the Wu Empire.</p><br/><p>In order to reward XiMen Sa\u2019s huge merit and to rope in the XiMen Family, Yu ManLou especially gave out an order to make XiMen Sa the deputy general. He was ordered to lead the direct forces of the XiMen Family and half the surrendered Western Han troops towards the Wu Empire. He also made the promise that when XiMen Sa returned with a victory, it would be time for him to be conferred as marquis.</p><br/><p>As such, the young family head of the XiMen Family transformed from an individual with the authority of a family in his hands to a young general with massive military forces within his grasp. As a young man, he had climbed up to the peak of authority! Such peerless glory made XiMen Sa shine so brightly that there were even some who compared him with Ling Tian\u2019s sudden appearance.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, everyone realized that in terms of background, stratagems, or martial arts, even if he wasn\u2019t comparable to Young Noble Ling, there wasn\u2019t too big of a difference between them. As such, praises sounded all across the continent and XiMen Sa\u2019s glory shone throughout the continent!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the news of the battle in the east flooded over like a tsunami. It came wave after wave with every single piece of news being so shocking!</p><br/><p>News after news, with each one being more shocking than the next!</p><br/><p>Starting a battle on three different fronts and defeating the 450,000 man army of the Xiao Family! Wiping out Southern Zheng! Trampling Eastern Zhao! All of these things happened at almost the same time. If it was during ordinary times, no one would ever be able to believe such news!</p><br/><p>How would a nouveau riche family like the Ling Family have such strength? But if this news wasn\u2019t false, just how powerful was the victorious Ling Family?!</p><br/><p>It was unbelievable!</p><br/><p>It was inconceivable!</p><br/><p>However, they had no choice but to believe it!</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Star Continent completely erupted!</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Yu Family.</p><br/><p>Yu Family Head, Yu ManLou stood in front of the window with his hands behind his back.</p><br/><p>Whenever he was in a bad or good mood, he would stand here without moving. Everyone knew that Yu ManLou had such a habit but they weren\u2019t able to tell when he was in a good mood and when he was in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>Family Head Yu never showed his expression on his face!</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, no one knew that the usually steady Family Head Yu was at a complete loss.</p><br/><p>He had easily pacified Western Han and was about to lead his army to the Wu Empire. He should be full of pride and at the peak of his morale but why was he at a loss?!</p><br/><p>Before Yu ManLou held the authority of the Yu Family in his hands, he was already an outstanding figure in the continent. After he took over the position of the family head, he was bold and decisive, with his prestige spreading across the entire continent. Not only was he able to unite the family into a single iron plate, he had even allowed the might of the family to spread out. The territory that was in the hands of Yu ManLou had far exceeded the previous generations of the Yu Family.</p><br/><p>Ever since Yu ManLou took the lead of the Yu Family, the strength of the Yu Family had reached a whole new level and a height never seen before in the past thousand years!</p><br/><p>Apart from that, Yu ManLou trained up a Yu Family personal army and hidden assassins. He mercilessly wiped out all of the opposing forces and for the forces that were swaying, he used both diplomacy and deterrence to subdue them. With a force in the open and another hidden, there was nothing that their family head couldn\u2019t solve!</p><br/><p>Look around Heavenly Star, ask around Heavenly Star, who else but me?!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou did not even place his thousand-year-old enemy, Water of Heavenly Wind, in his eyes!</p><br/><p>With this confidence in his heart, Yu ManLou had never lost a single battle!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yu ManLou\u2019s confidence was already in pieces.</p><br/><p>Holding onto the military reports from all over the continent, Yu ManLou\u2019s hands were clenched tightly to the point his knuckles turned white\u2026</p><br/><p>The five-year bet, a large gamble with the world as the stakes!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou shook his head and a dismal smile rose on his face. Could it be that his decision back then was wrong? If he risked internal injuries to kill Ling Tian back then, would the situation today be better? However, was there still a point for him to ponder over such hypotheses? After all, there isn\u2019t such a thing as \u2018if\u2019 in the world.</p><br/><p>It had only been a couple of years since Ling Tian entered into his sights. Ling Tian was a child who was less than twenty years old after all, and Yu ManLou had already put a large amount of attention on him. Now that he thought about it, Yu ManLou had still underestimated Ling Tian. From the time Ling Tian had appeared in Yu ManLou\u2019s sights, Ling Tian was destined to become a powerful opponent for him. In less than a single year, Ling Tian had already developed to the point that Yu ManLou himself couldn\u2019t control him! When Ling Tian was being chased by the Martial Order Medallion owner, Justice, Ling Tian even had the guts to barge into Bright Jade City and set a five-year bet with him!</p><br/><p>After a mere three months of the bet being started, Yu ManLou already felt that he would lose.</p><br/><p>In these short three months, the Ling Family started wars in all directions and swept the opposing armies clean. The Ling Family army fought with incomparable valor and Ling Tian himself was actually capable of prematurely escaping from Justice\u2019s chase. By making use of the misunderstanding of the world, Ling Tian hid in the dark and controlled the scenes from behind. He single-handedly designed this war that spread across half the continent and ensnared all of his enemies who were caught off guard into a gigantic trap!</p><br/><p>In just this war alone that spread across half the continent, there were 1,000,000 fatalities at the very least!</p><br/><p>What was the population of the whole Heavenly Star Continent?</p><br/><p>All of these lives were lost just so Ling Tian could create a step for himself to ascend to the peak.</p><br/><p>The southeast half of Heavenly Star Continent was already in the hands of the Ling Family. As for his Yu Family, he only managed to defeat a small Western Han Empire. While it was not considered a small victory, the difference between the two was extremely obvious! Victory and defeat between the two was extremely clear!</p><br/><p>In the large hall, the upper echelons of the Yu Family stood to the side trembling with fear. Not a single person dared to let out a single noise. It would be akin to seeking death if they were to provoke their family head right now.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe army is to set off immediately and the experts of the family are to rush to the front lines. The Wu Empire is to be wiped out in five days! Destroy the remaining forces of the BeiMing Family!\u201d Yu ManLou did not turn around and let out this order! His tone was exceptionally severe and completely displayed Yu ManLou\u2019s resolution. Under such circumstances, it would be impossible for anyone to persuade Yu ManLou and he would definitely not accept any opinions!</p><br/><p>Destroy the Wu Empire in five days! Annihilate the BeiMing Family!</p><br/><p>This was an unbelievable target! However, everyone knew that since their family head issued such an order, then they would have to complete this mission in five days even if it meant their death! If they did not complete this mission, their family head would not be stingy with his anger and none of them would be able to endure Yu ManLou\u2019s anger!</p><br/><p>Regardless of the price and consequences!</p><br/><p>These six words ignited the fighting spirit of these old assassins who had once roamed unhindered in the pugilistic world.</p><br/><p>This was the only chance for Yu ManLou to level his disadvantage! He had no choice but to try!</p><br/><p>Five days, if they could wipe out the Wu Empire in five days, there would be a chance for Yu ManLou to emerge victorious in their gamble. At that time, both the families would be at the same starting point again. The Yu Family\u2019s starting point would be at Northern Wei and the Ling Family\u2019s foundation would be at Sky Bearing. However, the Yu Family had a thousand more years of accumulation as compared to the Ling Family! If Yu ManLou could still lose under such circumstances, he would truly have thrown all of his face.</p><br/><p>If everything was successful, and the Yu Family wiped out the Wu Empire, the Yu Family would only be left with a Moon Deity Empire and the Ling Family would only be left with a Xiao Family. Even though the Xiao Family\u2019s strength was largely wiped out, as long as the flood waters of the Blue Jade River do not subside, Ling Tian would not have a way to attack the Xiao Family. At the end of the day, the Xiao Family still had 3,000 miles of fertile land and would definitely be self-sufficient. Besides that, the Xiao Family still has a thousand years of foundation, and even if their vitality was greatly injured, they still had the ability to put up a good fight.</p><br/><p>As for Yu ManLou\u2019s half of the continent, although the Moon Deity Empire was extremely far away, victory wasn\u2019t an issue. Their army only needed some time to get there and with the aid of the Lei Family, the Moon Deity Empire wasn\u2019t a big problem.</p><br/><p>If the Xiao Family wanted to protect themselves, it wouldn\u2019t be an issue. But if the Xiao Family wasn\u2019t willing to accept their defeat or wanted to receive their Xiao Family army on the outside and attempt to reopen the Blue Jade River Pass, then things would be extremely bad. At the very least, it would be extremely bad for the Yu Family.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the Ling Family would not let go of this opportunity and would definitely take down the Xiao Family. At that time, half of the continent would be united under the Ling Family\u2019s banner. To the Yu Family, it signified their loss of the gigantic bet. But the problem was, Yu ManLou couldn\u2019t bear to lose!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the Lei Family here yet?\u201d Yu ManLou frowned and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Lei Family has arrived but big brother isn\u2019t willing to agree to their condition. Thus, the situation between both families is pretty awkward.\u201d A crisp voice sounded and it was Second Master Yu, Yu ManTang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Lei\u2019s Family\u2019s ambition is far too big!\u201d Yu ManLou snorted, \u201cThey can obviously tell that this is a once in a lifetime opportunity for our Yu Family and wants to use this opportunity to blackmail me. They really don\u2019t know how the word death is written!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang fell silent and did not say another word. He also did not know what he should say. Ever since he found out what Yu ManLou wanted the Lei Family to do, Yu ManTang had a huge barrier in his heart.</p><br/><p>A cold glare flashed past Yu ManLou\u2019s eyes and a sinister smile surfaced on his face, \u201cTell Lei ZhenTian that as long he agrees to aid my Yu Family when we attack the Moon Deity Empire, together with this current matter, I will agree to their request. After I gain the world, we will split it in half! We will form a black and white contract and make an oath to the heavens. We will never go back on our word and the successors of the Yu Family will not go against this contract.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang felt his body shake and he let out a long sigh in his heart as he helplessly agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, if they want to gain benefits, they will have to put in some effort. I want them to begin their operation immediately! The moment the Ling Family clears out the hidden troubles of Southern Zheng, all of their forces will return to Sky Bearing. At that time, we would only be adding on to the number of casualties and it would be impossible for the mission to be successful. We cannot let go of this opportunity before our eyes and they only have a single day to consider the matter. If they aren\u2019t willing to agree after a day, my proposal would be invalid! Let them go back to where they come from and we will never form an alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou said severely.</p><br/><p>Even though the deal with Ling Tian said that both their families weren\u2019t allowed to interfere with each other during these five years, the Lei Family wasn\u2019t included in their agreement. If the Lei Family wanted to attack the Ling Family, even if it was under the command of the Yu Family, Ling Tian could not say anything about it. Even if Ling Tian knew that the Yu Family\u2019s shadow was behind this matter, not a single member of his Yu Family participated in the mission and Ling Tian couldn\u2019t do anything about it! If you have the ability, you can also command someone to attack my Yu Family!</p><br/><p>As long as the Lei Family succeeded in their mission, the Ling Family would suffer from a never before felt heavy blow. Even if Ling Tian didn\u2019t die, the chance for him to rise up again would be slim.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian, ah Ling Tian, despite your peerless wisdom, do you know of a plan called \u2018Expelling the tigers and swallowing the wolves\u2019?</p><br/><p>If the Lei Family was able to wipe out the Ling Family before the Ling Family\u2019s battle on three fronts ended, how would they be able to escape from Ling Tian\u2019s revenge? With Ling Tian\u2019s strength, he would probably be able to single-handedly turn the Lei Family upside down. Besides that, there were a couple of top-notch experts beside him and the Lei Family\u2019s situation wouldn\u2019t be too optimistic.</p><br/><p>Even if the Lei Family was able to survive, how many of them would be left behind? At that time, with their complete shortage of manpower, how would they be able to split the world with him? What a joke! A single imperial order would be sufficient to execute their whole family! While the Yu Family\u2019s future generations would recognize the contract, if the Lei Family was wiped out before the successor to the Yu Family appears, it definitely wouldn\u2019t be considered a breach of their contract.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou snickered. If there is a fool in the world who believes something like a promise or contract, Yu ManLou would be letting their stupidity down if he didn\u2019t make good use of it!</p><br/><p>Oath? If oaths would truly be fulfilled, there probably wouldn\u2019t be many in the world who would die a peaceful death. They would have probably died from a thousand arrows piercing their heart and five bolts of lightning striking them from above. However, there are only a few who would die from a thousand arrows piercing their heart and it was rare even on a battlefield. As for being struck by five bolts of lightning, there hasn\u2019t been a single person who died from such a horrifying death\u2026</p><br/><p>Second Master Yu ManTang let out a long sigh, turned around and walked out.</p><br/><p>A period of time later, a messenger pigeon flew into Yu ManLou\u2019s study. The Lei Family had also agreed and would set off after noon, concealing themselves in Sky Bearing while waiting for an opportunity.</p><br/><p>Crushing the note in his hands motionlessly, a weird smile could be seen on Yu ManLou\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p><em>Ling Tian, I admit that cutting off the Blue Jade River and launching a swift attack was something that was completely out of my expectations. Up until now, I still do not understand how you created such a miracle. I was unable to seize the opportunity while you had the ability to seize the opportunity and I will not blame others. However, my plan of expelling the tigers and swallowing the wolves will definitely be out of your expectations. Currently, the Sky Bearing\u2019s Ling Family is completely emptied out and all the elites of your Ling Family are out fighting the war. I want to take a good look. After your Ling Residence and Ling Family Courtyard are wiped out, will you be able to play anything new after your vitality is harmed that badly?</em></p><br/><p>********</p><br/><p>Late at night, the stars filled the sky.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian flipped over the wild boar thigh on top of the barbecue rack and an aromatic meaty fragrance permeated through the air. He then let out a sigh and said, \u201cAfter so many years, my cooking skills are still so marvelous. I am truly impressed with myself. I am truly a work of art.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue hugged her knees and sat by the side obediently with a look of satisfaction on her face, \u201cWhat a pity, this wild boar isn\u2019t the same as ours. Tian\u2019ge, do you know how much I looked forward to having a simple meal with you back then? It was a pity that up until my death\u2026\u201d Li Xue\u2019s sleeves fluttered in the cool night breeze and an orange glow could be seen on her face. With half her face glowing and the other half in the dark, her beauty seemed all the more alluring and mysterious. At this moment, she was like a little girl who no one cared about and her loneliness and pitiful appearance was extremely moving.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s hand which was holding onto a piece of firewood paused and he shook his head. Interrupting her, he said gently, \u201cEverything in the past is no more than a dream. Be good, don\u2019t think about all of that. Today, let your older brother display his abilities. I am certain that your weight will definitely soar up after today to a hundred and eighty\u2026\u201d he smiled and winked before adding on, \u201ckilograms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKilograms? Is there even such a thing as kilograms in this world? A hundred and eighty kilograms?! Do you think that I am a pig?\u201d Li Xue burst out laughing and her depressed mood was washed away by Ling Tian\u2019s joke and her she leaned on Ling Tian\u2019s chest mumbling, \u201cI am only 52 kilograms right now. Not to mention 180 kilograms, even 70 kilograms would make me too embarrassed to live on the planet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201d Ling Tian smiled, \u201cAfter a period of time, it would be a wonder if you don\u2019t weigh 70 kilograms.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only know how to spout nonsense. How could I be so heavy?!\u201d Li Xue frowned and pondered for a long while, \u201cSomething like that will certainly never happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian chuckled and a vulgar expression was plastered all over his face, \u201cIf they are twins, perhaps 90 kilograms or more is possible. That would be a woman\u2019s most happy moment! Don\u2019t tell me you have never thought about it. Haven\u2019t you been waiting for two lifetimes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t you think of something better!\u201d Li Xue\u2019s face flushed red and her body heated up from embarrassment as she hammered Ling Tian mercilessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this something good?\u201d Ling Tian chuckled, \u201cThis is something extremely good. Unless I am wrong and you don\u2019t actually want it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d Li Xue\u2019s face puffed up in anger and she turned around to ignore Ling Tian. At the same time, she could not help but fantasize about what Ling Tian had just said. The more she thought about it, the warmer she felt. In both her past life and this one, she dreamed about it time and time again!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian could clearly feel the beauty in his embrace heating up slowly. He was immediately stunned and quickly retreated back from the fire.</p><br/><p>The two of them had secretly slipped away for a day and night already. Currently, the two of them were at the place where they agreed to meet Ling Jian. Besides that, this road was also a path that the Above Heavens experts would definitely use after venting their anger on the Yu Family at Northern Wei!</p><br/><p>Just a day ago, Ling Tian received news that Above Heavens had settled their conflict with the Yu Family and it is said that the Yu Family took a huge step back. Currently, they were speedily making their way to the southeast to reinforce the Xiao Family.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian naturally knew why Yu ManLou wanted to take a step back and cursed Yu ManLou many times over in his heart for being a vicious old fox! In order to allow these Above Heavens to seek trouble with him, Yu ManLou had actually taken a large step back!</p><br/><p>In comparison, if it was Ling Tian he would never take a step back. He would rather wipe them all out before going to deal with Yu ManLou himself. However, Yu ManLou made such a decision without hesitation.</p><br/><p>This made Ling Tian feel an immense pressure! For Yu ManLou to take a step back when facing Above Heavens, it wasn\u2019t because he was afraid of them but on the contrary, it was because Yu ManLou did not place them in his sights at all. If the Above Heavens experts were truly powerful to the point it made Yu ManLou feel wary, Yu ManLou would have definitely kept them all in Bright Jade City regardless of the price.</p><br/><p>Thus, Yu ManLou would rather lose his face and allow these people to return so that they could create trouble for Ling Tian. This also showed that Ling Tian was the one who Yu ManLou thought was his true opponent!</p><br/><p>Thus, he would rather lose some face if he could create some loss for Ling Tian by borrowing the strength of the Above Heavens experts.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian felt hatred for Yu ManLou to the point that his heart itched.</p></div>\n</div>"}

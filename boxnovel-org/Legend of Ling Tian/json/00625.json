However, they all knew that they shouldn\u2019t continue to probe.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan smiled with happiness in her eyes, \u201cTalking about Tian\u2019ge, I truly find it strange. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything in the world that Tian\u2019ge cannot achieve. There isn\u2019t anything he doesn\u2019t know and anything that he is incapable of doing. How can there be such a capable individual in the world? Even Justice from Beyond Heavens is also incomparable in this aspect.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words had truly struck the heart of the ladies and they nodded their heads in agreement. The only exception would be Miss Li Xue who knew Ling Tian the best!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou lifted up her wine glass and did not take a sip but looked distracted and said, \u201cIn truth\u2026 he is an extremely strange person. In my eyes, he seems to be wrapped up in layers of mystery. Every time I feel like I am about to unveil the mystery, I would find myself only unveiling a thin layer of the mystery. It seems impossible to find the truth behind the mystery.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words of hers immediately received the approval of the others and Xiao YanXue said with a smile, \u201cI agree. I also feel the same but I have already decided to not think about this matter any further. After all, no matter how we try to dig up the truth, it is impossible\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou chuckled and said with a perplexed tone, \u201cIt is strange indeed. If you call him a good guy, he can be worse than anyone else at times. But if you call him a bad person, you will feel that he is extremely nice at times. The most frustrating thing is the fact that even if I know that he is making use of me, I cannot help but go along with his wishes\u2026\u201d Shui QianRou\u2019s voice turned soft and her fringe fell down blocking half her face as she muttered, \u201cHe\u2026 is he someone good or bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>The room fell silent.</p><br/><p>Is Ling Tian someone good or bad? This question is one that even Li Xue who transmigrated with Ling Tian had no answer to.</p><br/><p>Li Xue rubbed her eyes and said, \u201cGood man? Bad man? How can you use such a simple adjective to describe Tian\u2019ge? So what if he is good or bad? All of you are too naive! There are far too many things in the world that can\u2019t be described by just good or bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s body shook and she continued, \u201cIf someone steals something, would he be a bad person? If someone robs another person, would he be a good person?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other ladies did not understand what Li Xue meant, \u201cOf course a thief and robber is a bad person! Do you even need to ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot necessarily right!\u201d Li Xue pointed out, \u201cIf the family of the thief or robber has to starve if he doesn\u2019t steal or rob, would he still be considered a bad person?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSimilarly, what if someone beats a little thief to death when attempting to catch him? Would this person be a good person or hero? Would the kin of the dead thief have goodwill towards the person who killed the thief? The person would only be seen as their enemy! An enemy who killed their father and husband! Naturally, there are many other possibilities. What if the family of the thief starves to death because of the death of the thief. Then would the person who killed the thief be responsible for the deaths of the thief\u2019s family?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is impossible to determine the good from bad! Everyone has a different standard of good and bad in his heart. Thus, the so-called good and bad is no more than a temporary feeling.\u201d Li Xue said with disdain, \u201cEveryone has their motive for doing anything, us included. We cannot judge the good from the bad. I only know that a person who thinks for his own kin, family and women, is a good person. Regardless of the methods they employ, at the very least, they are someone with responsibility!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn my impression, Ling Tian is someone like that. He can\u2019t be considered good because he has done many despicable deeds and even harmed the lives of countless people! Of course, you cannot say that he is bad because of this. He has also done countless good deeds, brought joy into the hearts of many and contributed greatly to the commoners! More importantly, he is the ideal husband for us ladies. Regardless of the past, as long as we are his family and woman, he will protect and care for us with all he has. He would fight a bloody battle on the frontlines just so that the people around him can live in joy and peace. To us women, this is enough! What more do we have to ask for? I would actually more afraid if my husband was a chivalrous hero or gentleman. Such a character would only bring hardship to his woman! What do you guys think?\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right, what more do we have to ask when we have such a husband? All the other ladies looked at Li Xue in agreement. All the ladies present today could definitely be considered a \u2018strong woman\u2019 and they fully understood what Li Xue said!</p><br/><p>Just as the saying goes, \u2018it is easy to find a priceless treasure but rare to find a sincere husband\u2019. As ladies, they were all emotional creatures and as long as their husband could treat them well, they would be satisfied for the rest of their lives. As for how he fights on the outside or how much blood he spills, they only need to ensure that he can return to a safe and comfortable home. This would be the happiest life in the world.</p><br/><p>In this world where the strong reign supreme, just who is the one in the right? Who is wrong? Who is the good and who is the bad? What is the point of bothering about all that! Is it truly meaningful?</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s voice sounded again, \u201cLing Tian truly does not have it easy. Do you think that he doesn\u2019t wish to lead a peaceful life with his women and enjoy the rest of his days? It is just that the circumstances of the world forced him to the forefront of danger. As long as he takes a step or even half a step back, his death is certain! Furthermore, he would be bringing all of us together with his many followers down together with him! He can only soldier on and walk to the peak of the world before having his peace.</p><br/><p>Li Xue then looked at the ladies and asked slowly, \u201cLet me ask all of you a question. If Ling Tian announces to the world right now that he is going to back out from the war for hegemony and disperse all of his armies, do you think the other powers would let go of him? Do you think they would be able to allow such a frightening character to live in their land?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the ladies faces turned dark and they shook their head. They all understood what it meant to uproot all potential sources of trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Thus, conflict is born. Little sister BingYan is from the Yu Family, little sister QianRou the Shui Family, little sister YanXue the Xiao Family and Tian\u2019ge\u2019s cousin Princess JiaoYue the Sky Bearing imperial family. All of these powers are not to be underestimated and if one lets their guard down when maneuvering among these powers, death is certain. However, because of all of you around here, everything that Ling Tian does is filled with difficulties and challenges but he never speaks about them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like the battle with the Xiao Family. We had countless chances to kill their commander, Xiao FengYang, on the battlefield! It wouldn\u2019t be difficult for us to do that but we still chose to capture him alive. Why? Because of little sister YanXue. However, there is something that I am certain of. If Xiao FengYang or the Xiao Family captured Tian\u2019ge, would they spare him because of little sister YanXue? Have any of you thought about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ladies looked at each other and a chill ran down their spine. If the Xiao Family caught Ling Tian, they would probably execute him on the spot! How would they give him a chance to survive?</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue\u2019s face was filled with guilt as she lowered her head. However, her heart was filled with sweetness.</p><br/><p>\u201cOn top of that, all of us understand that the Yu Family is the mastermind of the attack of the Lei Family. But so what? We have all the most elite assassins in the world and if we want to assassinate the important characters of the Yu Family, Bright Jade City would already be filled with blood. Even if it would be a difficult matter for us to assassinate the Yu Family Head, what about the others of the Yu Family? However, Tian\u2019ge did not say a single word about it or even made a reaction. Why is this so? Isn\u2019t this because of little sister BingYan?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sister QianRou, while Ling Tian has his own motives when dealing with your Shui Family, he could also choose to use a completely different method to deal with your Shui Family. He had at least three different ways to completely destroy the Shui Family! However, Ling Tian also did not make such a choice and I believe I don\u2019t need to point out the reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue looked at the ladies with a profound gaze and they all lowered their head with guilt, \u201cI believe that all of you hadn\u2019t thought about such things before, right? I should not be the one to say such things but I still have to say them. Currently, the biggest dilemma that Ling Tian faces is how he should treat the three of you. He has to be wary of the three of your emotions and not hurt any of you. If not, Ling Tian might have already been the ruler of the world! There isn\u2019t a need to go through so much trouble! Not to mention the Sky Bearing imperial family, even the Shui, Yu and Xiao Family would disappear in a single night!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAH?! He would already be the ruler of the world?! He would be able to destroy the families in a single night?\u201d The four ladies cried out in unison, \u201cHow is this possible?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue downed her glass of wine before saying slowly, \u201cDo you here think that I am bragging? I wonder if all of you remember that during the battle with the Xiao Family, a mountain collapsed to block the Blue Jade River, cutting off the communications of the Xiao Family and allowing us to gain the upper hand. I believe that all of you should not have forgotten about it right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course we remember, but what has this got to do with ruling over the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue sneered, \u201cLet me tell all of you. That mountain did not collapse on its own but it was because of Ling Tian\u2019s hidden card! Ling Tian was the one who used a mysterious method to cause the collapse of the mountain!\u201d</p><br/><p>Apart from Ling Chen, the other three ladies were astounded!</p><br/><p>\u201cCausing a mountain which has been around for millions of years to collapse in an instant. Is wiping out a Yu, Shui or Xiao Family really that difficult?\u201d Li Xue said profoundly.</p><br/><p>The three ladies were in complete shock!</p></div>\n</div>"}

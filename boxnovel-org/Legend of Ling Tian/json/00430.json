Making such a promise at this time was really overstepping his boundaries. While he had confidence that his family would agree to him, but from an outsider\u2019s point of view, it was hard to merely trust in his words. An endorsement of sorts was still needed.</p><br/><p>Seeing the black-robed man turning to leave, Shui QianHuan hurriedly replied, \u201cPavilion Head, please wait. I still have something to say.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-robed man lightly huffed as he stopped, and spoke impatiently, \u201cWhat is it? I don\u2019t have all day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Pavilion Head wishes to pull out, then I have a presumptuous favor to ask, would Pavilion Head please consider it?\u201d Shui QianHuan said and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you already mentioned that it is a presumptuous favor, then why bother to ask?\u201d The masked man coldly replied, \u201cThe First Pavilion kills for money, plunders those who plunder, but has never once talked about giving favors.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe,\u201d Shui QianHuan laughed drily, then replied, \u201cThe Yu Family has deep roots, and the family head Yu ManLou has three sons, each more outstanding than the other. Since Pavilion Head has already done in one of them, then why stop there? You could actually eliminate the other two! Once the Yu Family is out of successors, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d The man in black seemed to have his interest piqued. \u201cYu ManLou still has two other children? But the mission given to us by the Ling Family didn\u2019t include these other two, and outside of my mission, I would have to charge extra.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan originally thought that he would reject the request, but hearing the change in tone, he couldn\u2019t help but rejoice. He spoke in an earnest tone, \u201cIf Pavilion Head has the intention, then we can definitely discuss the price further. The excess fees will be borne by my Shui Family. How could the Ling Family be allowed to take on such an excessive price? So long as Pavilion Head can offer a price, this subject here will definitely not bargain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis seat will consider whether or not this plan is feasible first. Wait for my reply, however, bear in mind that our current contract ends when the sun rises.\u201d The moment he finished his sentence, the masked man didn\u2019t wait another moment. No movements were seen from him, but the shut door of the room suddenly opened and his shadow vanished without a sound.</p><br/><p>Not long after, in the midst of the deep darkness, a pure black messenger falcon shot up into the sky like a black arrow, circling once around the area before flying towards the south\u2026</p><br/><p>In the early morning, the rays of dawn shone down on Mount Victory, south of Sky Bearing. The mass of flowers present looked like a silk brocade piece, with the jade-like grasses beckoning the wind. A light mist hung around the mountain, making it look at first glance like an immortal\u2019s dwelling, a garden in the heavens!</p><br/><p>Ever since the construction of the Ling Family Courtyard at the foot of this mountain, where they had almost excavated half the original mountain, the shrubbery on the mountain had received untold benefits. Every now and then, there would be professional gardeners that would come over to care for them, and under the foresight of the transmigrator Ling Tian, a large scale and unique landscape garden was constructed on Mount Victory, with stones of all shapes, as well as little rivers and bridges. Even the hedges were pruned to different shapes, creating a pleasant and refreshing atmosphere much like a summer resort.</p><br/><p>At this point, one could see over a dozen warriors with a hand on their swords, standing majestic and tall at every entrance into the area, all with stern and cold expressions.</p><br/><p>At the top of the mountain, among the mattress of jade-green grasses, a few strips of snow-white cloth fluttered with the wind as it moved. They looked like fairies or immortals that had descended upon the mortal world.</p><br/><p>If someone were to be able to zoom in, they wouldn\u2019t believe their eyes! This was because standing there were three heaven toppling beauties, the likes of which could probably be counted on a hand even if one scoured the entire continent. But three of them actually appeared right at this very place!</p><br/><p>The lady in the middle had a cold and indifferent expression, slightly knitted brows, with a face carrying some sort of worry. Around her body, one could practically see wisps of cold air emanating from her, as though she was cast out of a block of Nine Mysterious Serene Ice. However, the other two ladies walking by her side seemed to not feel it; obviously, her ability to control her strength had already reached one with her mind. This person was the current presiding head of the Ling Family Courtyard, Ling Chen.</p><br/><p>On her left was a lady whose voluminous black hair draped beautifully over her shoulder, with an expression of calm and contentedness on her face. A mischievous smile occasionally surfaced at the corners of her mouth, causing people to involuntarily feel close to her. She was the little princess of the Yu Family, Yu BingYan.</p><br/><p>And on the right was a lady with a somewhat desolate expression, with brows that slanted slightly upward, as though showing her obstinacy. While she was a lady, her aura was unyielding like that of a hardened man! The Shui Family\u2019s little princess, Shui QianRou.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that no one would have imagined at this time, that the three of us would be walking side by side. This is even more so for the two of you. Furthermore, you two being the representatives for the millennia-long feud between the two great families. I heard that it would always be a battle to the death, and you two could thus be said to be mortal enemies from birth! However, looking at the two of you talking and laughing together, all I can say is that the world is really miraculous!\u201d Ling Chen smiled as she addressed the two.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou cast a complicated look at Yu BingYan and remained silent.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan on the other hand smiled and replied, \u201cNothing is ever too bizarre in this world, so how could anything be impossible? While the two of us were born as enemies, we don\u2019t have any hatred between us. It is just that we were born too late and can\u2019t change the grudges from a millennium ago! However, we can still be good friends and good sisters, after all, it is not our choice, just our fate.\u201d</p><br/><p>An emotional expression appeared on the face of Shui QianRou, and she suddenly turned to face Yu BingYan, smiling as she replied, \u201cMiss Yu is indeed open-minded. It is instead QianRou that has neglected this point, and in this I have embarrassed myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan tittered as she replied, \u201cThat might not be the case. Miss Shui has been regarded as a heaven-sent genius since young, and the family would definitely have great expectations for you. However, BingYan has been a cripple since young and is a mere pawn for the upcoming battle, hence I saw the bigger picture.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen also interjected with a smile, \u201cSeeing the two of you so genteel and polite with each other is really a little unbearable. It\u2019s not even the time of the battle, so rather than just simply exploring and having fun together, how about the two of you become sworn sisters? Who says that a life or death battle means that both parties can\u2019t be friends before that? Or even sisters?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the words fell, Yu BingYan and Shui QianRou seemed to have been struck, and immediately looked at the other party to see their intentions.</p><br/><p>Both were peerless beauties and afflicted with the same fate since they were born, as good as sisters in spirit. Today, having met each other, they were both left in awe at the other party\u2019s bearing and demeanor. Both had feelings of pity and could feel that if they really fell to the other during the battle, it would become a story that would be spread far and wide.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan let out a lovable laugh and gushed, \u201cI do want that, but it\u2019s just that Sister Shui might not take too kindly to befriending a sick girl like me, so I don\u2019t dare ask.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou broke into laughter at this, exclaiming, \u201cThis sister has but a small ailment, furthermore still looks like an immortal amongst the mortals, really making those who gaze at you pity you unconditionally. How could I have the intention of ignoring you? Furthermore, Miss Chen is correct in saying that even though our families have a feud, and that our fate has long been decided for us, which will end with the demise of one of us. Since that\u2019s the case, then if we can be sisters for a good three years, when the time comes there would be nothing better than to die under a sister\u2019s hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan exulted in joy, while Ling Chen rolled her eyes and replied, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you two? Am I too ugly to be seen? Since today has such perfect weather, how about the three of us become sworn sisters? If this spreads out, when people find out that the three feuding families actually have us three sisters, then this will definitely become a source of news that will shock the entire pugilistic community, hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The three girls laughed together, with Yu BingYan and Shui QianRou continuously giving thumbs up. Each of them picked up a pinch of soil to serve as the incense and bowed to the heavens. Ling Chen was already past seventeen, thus she became the eldest sister; Shui QianRou having just passed her seventeenth birthday became the second sister, and the youngest fell to Yu BingYan who was only sixteen.</p><br/><p>After the ceremony ended, the trio were unable to contain their joy. However, each of their minds was full of their own calculations. In Shui QianRou\u2019s heart, this thing would only last for two to three years at most. Once the battle between the Families began, they wouldn\u2019t be able to accommodate all sides, and the feelings of sisterhood between them would also slowly fade. Furthermore, Yu BingYan\u2019s character was lovable and cute, invoking feelings of pity in her own inner heart, thus she didn\u2019t loathe the thought of becoming sisters for a few years with her.</p><br/><p>As for Yu BingYan, her thought process was different. The same fate that awaited both her and Shui QianRou made her understand the burden faced by QianRou, but Yu BingYan\u2019s didn\u2019t have many expectations in her heart. For her to be able to obtain Ling Tian\u2019s recognition was already more than enough for her, just like the saying, \u2018Other than the heavens itself, there was nothing more one needed\u2019. Her joining the sworn sisters was actually just riding the waves and agreeing to what Ling Chen suggested. While she didn\u2019t disagree with this notion, she also didn\u2019t find it pressing. She didn\u2019t understand the true meaning behind why Ling Chen would suggest such a thing.</p><br/><p>Finally, how could Ling Chen not have any thoughts? In her heart, Ling Tian\u2019s plans of hegemony had just begun. If things didn\u2019t go well, naturally they need not talk about anything else, as she would just slit her throat and join her loved one! However, if things worked out, then Ling Tian would become the owner of all under heavens, a respected monarch! When the time came, how could he only have a few close female confidantes?</p><br/><p>Based on Ling Tian, the saying of \u2018Three palaces, 72 concubines, and a harem of 3,000 beauties\u2019 would never come to pass, but he couldn\u2019t have just one or two women around him! Furthermore, if Ling Tian wanted to pacify the rest of the world when he ascended the throne, he would need to ensure that the behemoths of the millennium-old families, the Yu and Shui Families, didn\u2019t feel wronged by allowing them some benefits to their descendants! As such, a battle for benefits was sure to take place and take up a lot of time in the process.</p><br/><p>However, with Yu BingYan becoming Ling Tian\u2019s woman, at least in name, and even the so-called \u2018first wife\u2019 and with Shui QianRou obviously showing much affection to Ling Tian, Ling Chen started to come out with a little scheme. If she could ensure that these two little princesses became Ling Tian\u2019s women\u2026 not only would everyone become more friendly due to familial ties, but would also not \u2018randomly shoot at the mice for fear of breaking the vases\u2019. The Ling Family would then stand to profit, in fact even having an unfair advantage!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Ling Chen had an even deeper scheme hiding within, which was that if she were to facilitate this sisterhood, then send the First Pavilion to get rid of all the potential successors of the Shui Family one by one\u2026 to that end, if Yu BingYan and Shui QianRou both became the only successors left in their families\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

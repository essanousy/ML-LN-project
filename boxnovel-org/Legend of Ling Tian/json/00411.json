After leaving the place and breathing a breath of fresh air, Ling Tian felt his mood lighten up as the frustrating thoughts were thrown out of his head.</p><br/><p>Li Xue stood behind him silently and realized that Ling Tian was suddenly silent and in thought. She couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat are you thinking about? Why do you look so troubled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was thinking,\u201d Ling Tian responded, \u201cjust what kind of a background does little sister Xue\u2019er have? Just what kind of an organization would be able to bring up a talent like little sister Xue\u2019er?!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a \u2018kacha\u2019 sound, Li Xue broke a branch under her feet as she chuckled, \u201cWhat kind of a background could this little sister have? This little sister\u2019s substandard martial arts are all my natural-born talent! Hehe, since big brother has asked me about it, why doesn\u2019t this little sister give a self-introduction?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a hearty laugh and said, \u201cIt would be my pleasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSour! How sour!\u201d Li Xue covered her lips out of habit as she giggled and realized that her veil was still on. She then placed her hands down and said slowly, \u201cThis little sister was born on the Misty Peak not too far away from here. My father, Li YuanNian, was a woodcutter and my mother was an ordinary peasant. When this little sister was about seven years old, both my parents passed away from illness and this little sister has been staying in the mountains alone since then. This time, I coincidentally met you in the mountains and this has been the longest I have been away from home.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian began to simmer as he thought, If you aren\u2019t willing to tell me the truth, can\u2019t you come up with a better lie? Would anyone in the world possibly believe that lousy story of yours? Only an idiot or fool would believe you!</p><br/><p>Little sister, aren\u2019t you a little too fantastic at cooking up a story? Would the daughter of a woodcutter have a demeanor and bearing like you? Would she have such unparalleled martial arts? Would she be able to kill eight men without breaking a sweat at all?</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t you at least come up with a better story like a reclusive expert taking a liking to your talents and teaching you all of his martial arts? Then, he transmitted all of his cultivation to you on his deathbed thus resulting in your present level of martial arts\u2026 If you were to give me such a story, I would at the very least be able to convince myself to believe you! At the very least, it wouldn\u2019t be that obvious of a lie!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been tough on you, little sister Xue\u2019er!\u201d Ling Tian said in an emotional tone, \u201cYou would actually leave your home because of me and lead such a miserable life. This brother here is moved to the point tears are welling up in my eyes. This brother will definitely repay little sister\u2019s kindness in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and die! Can\u2019t you be serious!\u201d Li Xue couldn\u2019t help but chuckle, \u201cI know that you will not believe me but this is indeed the truth. Even though I myself can\u2019t believe the truth, it is up to you whether or not you want to believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out two dry coughs and immediately stopped probing Li Xue about her background. No matter what, one must never argue with a lady about who was right! One must never try to reason with a lady! Be it in the ancient times or the 21st century, this was a golden rule which carried the truths of the universe!</p><br/><p>If a lady were to argue with you that the sun is actually a mooncake, it is best for you to just agree with her and even make her feel that she is right. Woah, so that was actually a mooncake? It really looks extremely appetizing and must definitely be delicious. It is definitely a double yoke mooncake\u2026 If you dare to disagree with her, you will definitely find yourself in an endless argument and she would definitely be able to come up with a thousand reasons to make you admit that the sun is actually a mooncake.</p><br/><p>Don\u2019t believe me? Break off a piece to try it for yourself! We will then see if you believe me or not!</p><br/><p>\u201cXue\u2019er, your martial arts are indeed extraordinary and this little brother truly admires you greatly. You can definitely name yourself as the number one lady in the world today. However, I wonder which expert is your master? It can\u2019t be that you don\u2019t have a master right?\u201d Ling Tian bootlicked and praised Li Xue as though he did not have any other intention.</p><br/><p>This little brat has become more crafty after coming to this world. However, it is a pity that there will always be someone more crafty! Li Xue then wittily replied, \u201cThis little sister\u2019s martial arts were due to a fortuitous encounter. When I was eight years old with both my parents deceased, this little sister had no choice but to go into the mountains to pick some fruits to fill my empty stomach. However, I fell off a tree by accident and thought that I would be accompanying my parents in death. Who would have imagined that there was a cave under the tree which was covered up by weeds? After this little sister fell down, my petite figure was caught by the weeds and I was actually completely uninjured. I also managed to find that cave because of that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough cough\u2026\u201d Ling Tian began coughing incessantly, Dammit, what an exaggerated lie! Petite figure? Caught by the weeds? What kind of weeds would be able to catch the figure of a falling girl? The force of the fall would be a hundred catties at the very least, right? Unless those weeds were the immortal plants grown by the Queen Mother of the Celestial Palace?!</p><br/><p>Cave! Falling down from a tree and entering the cave! Then why didn\u2019t you fall into it while climbing up the tree? Furthermore, how could the opening of a cave be facing the skies? Wouldn\u2019t that be a pitfall instead? If that\u2019s the case, not to mention a few years or centuries, it would have been covered up by soil in just a mere few months!</p><br/><p>Looking at the thick-skinned lass continuing her story in an unembarrassed fashion, Ling Tian raised his hands in surrender as he said with a bitter laugh, \u201cThen you entered the cave and were shocked to realize that it was the tomb of a martial arts senior, am I right? This senior was an unparalleled expert from a few hundred years ago and by the side of his remains were a few easily understood martial arts manuals. You then cultivated according to the manuals and actually attained heaven-shocking martial arts. However, you treated riches and honors like fleeting clouds and so decided to lead a reclusive life in the mountains. Upon meeting me coincidentally this time, you found that we got along pretty well, and upon finding out that I was in trouble you decided to help me and leave the mountain. Am I right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow!\u201d Li Xue looked at Ling Tian with a feigned look of worship, \u201cTian\u2019ge! You are truly too talented! Your guess was completely correct. I finally understand that it wasn\u2019t a coincidence for you to become the number one enemy of the world. To think that you were actually able to guess the rest of the story. Admiration, admiration\u2026 this little sister is truly filled with admiration! Hehehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at this lass laughing so gleefully, Ling Tian\u2019s face was covered with black lines! He sped up his movement techniques and wanted to leave this thick-skinned lass behind. At the same time, he felt that this feeling of being frustrated to the point he wanted to explode was actually quite familiar\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 why are you running? Do you want to have a competition of speed? I don\u2019t mind!\u201d Li Xue sped up as she said delightedly, \u201cWho asked you to doubt my background? Hehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wrong\u2026\u201d Ling Tian said with a defeated look. He knew that it was impossible for him to shake this lass off and began to plead, \u201cI won\u2019t call you little sister anymore. Big sister, please continue to keep it a secret and stop making up stories\u2026 There isn\u2019t a need for you to talk about your majestic past anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue burst out into a joyful giggle as Ling Tian let out a depressed sigh and continued speeding forward. At the same time, a saying by a sage surfaced in his mind: A despicable man and a female are the two most difficult people to raise! A sage is a sage indeed, his words were just far too accurate!</p><br/><p>From far behind them, a sudden explosion could be heard. It was like thunder on a clear sky and as though the wrath of the heavens was incurred! The earth shattered and rivers flowed backward!</p><br/><p>Both of them could feel the ground beneath them trembling! The ground beneath them then flipped over, burying the leaves underground and the pine trees around them shook from the tremors, covering the ground with a new layer of pine leaves!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems like Justice has truly gone crazy! Those fellows are probably dead! It is a pity I can\u2019t witness it for myself\u2026 what a pity!\u201d Both of them looked back at the same time with solemn faces. While they were extremely far away, they could still feel such a huge tremor. One could imagine just how devastated the actual battlefield was!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person\u2019s martial arts are truly\u2026 truly\u2026 the number one in the world! He is far above me!\u201d Li Xue looked towards the pine leaves falling onto the ground and felt the true prestige of the number one expert. She couldn\u2019t help but feel a lingering fear from when she tried to hold Justice back. \u201cIf he really intended to kill me back then, would I have been able to escape?\u201d For the first time in her life, she couldn\u2019t help but feel her confidence was shaken.</p><br/><p>When she had faced Justice and used her wits to make a fool out of him, this lass did indeed look down on the title of \u2018number one expert\u2019. Furthermore, his movement technique was truly too hideous and far from a match to her own and Ling Tian\u2019s movement techniques.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

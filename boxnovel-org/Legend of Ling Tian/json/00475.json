They flew over the buildings without a sound, drew their swords, and their swords stabbed out like two venomous snakes. Every place their sword light flashed by, the vegetation would be slashed apart cleanly and sent flying into the sky.</p><br/><p>Above the roof, the Yu Family experts looked at the escaping Meng WuQing and then looked at their Family Head launching an attack as though he was facing a great enemy. They were then stuck in a dilemma about whether they should give chase to the escaping experts or join their Family Head\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>With just that slight moment of doubt, Meng WuQing and the rest disappeared into the darkness.</p><br/><p>With a loud bang, a huge crater was formed in the ground from Yu ManLou\u2019s palm strike. At the same time, the swords of the two black-robed experts also shot past the sky. To the surprise of everyone else, Yu ManLou\u2019s palm strikes and the two sword strikes of the black-robed experts had actually struck air.</p><br/><p>With a wave of slashing sounds, the diced-up vegetation floated down gently from the sky.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou\u2019s eagle\u2019s eyes were locked onto the place where his palm struck out and feeling the empty feeling of his palm strike, he let out a sneer. Although he didn\u2019t know what method his opponent used to avoid his attack, Yu ManLou was certain that there was definitely someone in that direction! Even if that person was able to alter the trajectory of his hidden weapons, how would that person be able to hide it from Yu ManLou\u2019s eagle-like eyes?</p><br/><p>As Yu ManLou stood still, the two black-robed men returned behind him and the Yu Family experts slowly gathered around from the roof. Naturally, the shadows were still completely motionless.</p><br/><p>The winds began to blow, and everyone\u2019s robes began to flutter in the winds. At the same time, the atmosphere in the place grew extremely heavy and stifling.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still aren\u2019t willing to come out? As a man, why are you acting in such a cowardly manner!\u201d Yu ManLou\u2019s voice sounded in a calm manner, \u201cOur Yu Family and your Above Heavens had never interfered with each other\u2019s affairs, but your esteemed sect had actually bullied your way right up to our doorstep! You caused both of our families to meet each other with weapons, and it is truly a pity.\u201d Yu ManLou lamented and a tinge of pity could be heard in his voice.</p><br/><p>The leaves fluttered lightly in the wind as though they were also lamenting with Yu ManLou.</p><br/><p>Behind Yu ManLou, the two black-robed experts stared at each other in confusion. Didn\u2019t our Family Head just say that Ling Tian was the one hiding in secret? Why did he proclaim that he was from Above Heavens now? Does he intend to pull the wool over the eyes of the Yu Family members to hide the matter of their third young noble colluding with Above Heavens? However, this didn\u2019t seem necessary with the status of their Family Head.</p><br/><p>While they weren\u2019t clear about why Yu ManLou would do that, Ling Tian was extremely clear about the reason in his heart. Right when he had used his Divine Shocking Dragon Formula to send out the gold and silver needles, the unease in his heart grew greater and greater and he hurriedly left his original spot. If he had left his spot just a bit later, he would have definitely be injured in the joint attack of the three experts. Thinking about the close shave, Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but be filled with a cold sweat.</p><br/><p>Seeing Yu ManLou\u2019s reaction and hearing what Yu ManLou had said, Ling Tian could be certain that Yu ManLou knew that he was the one hiding in the dark. However, Yu ManLou had still proclaimed him to be a member of Above Heavens, and Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but be filled with disdain.</p><br/><p>An old fox indeed; a wily old fox! Because Ling Tian was still his in-law in name and the husband-to-be of Yu BingYan, even if Yu ManLou wanted to tear Ling Tian into pieces, he must not allow the world to know that he had such vicious thoughts towards his in-law. Thus, he had no choice but to proclaim that Ling Tian was a member of Above Heavens.</p><br/><p>Even if he found out that this person was Ling Tian in the future, he could just give an excuse that he killed the wrong person. It wouldn\u2019t matter if the people in the world doubted him, the important thing was that he didn\u2019t knowingly order Ling Tian\u2019s death. Ling Tian finally knew why his plan of instigating Yu LiuFeng\u2019s little scheme would cause so many experts of the Yu Family to be mobilized. It turns out that Yu ManLou\u2019s true target was himself. The person who Yu ManLou truly wanted to plot against was himself!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian was puzzled about how Yu ManLou knew that this matter was related to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can no longer escape.\u201d Yu ManLou said slowly, \u201cYou actually dare to interfere in the internal affairs of my Yu Family and sow discord between both my sons. You deserve death! However, giving face to Above Heavens, I will promise you a complete corpse if you reveal yourself right now.\u201d</p><br/><p>For Yu ManLou to repeatedly mention Above Heavens, it was number one to give Ling Tian a title of belonging to Above Heavens and number two for his subordinates by the side to hear. Ling Tian was certain that Yu ManLou was definitely not mentioning Above Heavens for himself to hear.</p><br/><p>First putting on a chastity ring before going out to become a prostitute. Old man, you truly have your means! Or perhaps everything has been going too well for him and he had begun to underestimate this old man. Was there any difference between having a complete corpse or having a mutilated corpse? Wouldn\u2019t the outcome still be death?</p><br/><p>Without surprise, the eyes of the many Yu Family experts immediately shone with enmity and the gazes of the many hiding in the shadows turned unfriendly.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou sneered in his heart. Just like how he didn\u2019t dare to reveal Ling Tian\u2019s true identity, he was also certain that it was impossible for Ling Tian to reveal his identity.</p><br/><p>\u201cSearch!\u201d Yu ManLou gave an order and more than ten people charged forward like hungry wolves.</p><br/><p>\u201cReporting to Family Head, there isn\u2019t anyone here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReporting to Family Head, there isn\u2019t anyone here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2018Reporting\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the reports of his subordinates, Yu ManLou\u2019s countenance turned darker and darker. He never imagined that the other party would still be able to remain hidden despite such a thorough search. This was something incredulous and something that even the Pavilion Head of the First Pavilion would be incapable of doing!</p><br/><p>Up until now, Yu ManLou could clearly feel that the other party had not left yet! At the same time, the other party also didn\u2019t have the chance to leave! However, just where was he hiding? The place was only so big, and how was it possible for him to hide from the eyes of everyone present?</p><br/><p>Such a concealment technique was definitely worthy of being called the number one in the world!</p><br/><p>Was Ling Tian truly this capable?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI am truly in admiration! Sir\u2019s concealment techniques are truly unparalleled! Even the number one assassin of the First Pavilion would probably have to admit that he is inferior in this regard!\u201d Yu ManLou said with sincerity and a trace of respect. This was something that everyone could very obviously hear, \u201cHowever, Sir made a mistake; a huge mistake! Regardless of how proficient you are in concealment techniques, this mistake of yours will render all of your techniques useless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou continued slowly, \u201cYou have only made use of the darkness to conceal yourself. While the vegetation here is dense, the daylight would definitely render the cover useless. It is only a couple of hours before daybreak, and I am certain that I will be able to wait for daybreak. However, can Sir afford to wait for daybreak?!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, Yu ManLou roared a command, \u201cArchers, lockdown the high points and the rest of you remain on the spot! From now on, all of you are to remain rooted to the spot and are prohibited from making the slightest sound until daybreak! Anyone who moves will be killed without mercy!</p><br/><p>After Yu ManLou gave his orders, all the Yu Family experts acknowledged the order and froze there on the spot. Their Family Head\u2019s order was something which they would never dare to defy. However, there were already a few of them silently grumbling in their hearts!</p><br/><p>The first one was definitely Ling Tian. Yu ManLou was completely right, and he was indeed making use of the darkness to conceal himself. The moment the sun came out, it would be impossible for him to maintain such a perfect concealment and the Yu Family experts would definitely be able to find his hiding spot. At that time, it would be impossible for him to escape. Thus, Ling Tian had to find a way to escape before the sun came out!</p><br/><p>As for the second person, it was the Head Deacon, Yu ChaoRan. Yu LiuFeng was still awaiting news of his mission tonight. The both of them had agreed to split up into two groups tonight. Yu ChaoRan would gather his men to surround Yu LiuShui\u2019s courtyard and after he succeeded, Yu LiuFeng would take action to apprehend Yu LiuShui. At that time, they would be brought in front of Yu ManLou and as long as their testimonies matched, Yu LiuShui wouldn\u2019t have a chance of escaping.</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou only had three sons and his eldest son, Yu LiuYun, was originally the most outstanding one. Everyone in the Yu Family had already recognized Yu LiuYun as the successor to the Yu Family but he had died pitifully in the hands of the First Pavilion. Currently, there were only two sons left and if Yu LiuFeng could make use of this opportunity to get rid of his competition, he would be the only person left in the race! Regardless of whether it is the territories or riches of their Yu Family, only Yu LiuFeng would have the rights to inherit them! As long as he was able to find concrete evidence on this mission of his, Yu LiuFeng was confident of kicking Yu LiuShui out of the race! This was something that Yu LiuFeng and Yu ChaoRan were certain about!</p><br/><p>However, their current mission wasn\u2019t very successful. While they were able to successfully capture this courtyard, they weren\u2019t able to catch a single person alive. While these people were obviously in Yu LiuShui\u2019s courtyard, there wasn\u2019t a single witness and no one would be able to ascertain why they were there! While Yu LiuShui would undoubtedly be the greatest suspect, he only needed to deny everything and no one would be able to do anything to him.</p><br/><p>They would require a flawless plan to ensure that Yu LiuShui would never be able to make a comeback. However, Yu ChaoRan was unable to send any news over to Yu LiuFeng and if he were to grow impatient and take action directly, things definitely wouldn\u2019t turn out well.</p><br/><p>After all, fighting his own sibling was a huge crime!</p><br/><p>At that time, if both of his sons made such grave mistakes, the mistakes would definitely cancel each other out. After all, no matter how ruthless Yu ManLou was, he couldn\u2019t possibly kill both of his remaining sons.</p><br/><p>As time passed by, Yu ChaoRan stood there silently and his old face was already covered with a cold sweat. If the Family Head were to know that he was involved in this matter, what would the Family Head think?</p><br/><p>The wind gradually died down and the cool of the night slowly went away. What came next was the fresh air of the dawn and the night sky began to light up gradually.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

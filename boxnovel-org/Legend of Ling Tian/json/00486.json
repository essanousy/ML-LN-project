The moment we rush indiscriminately into action, the only thing that will be buried with us is the family that we\u2019ve run for centuries! Second Uncle, this niece begs you to be more realistic! Be patient and endure for a while more. Father\u2019s death will not be in vain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo!\u201d NanGong TianHu burst into a rage, pulling at his hair. Strands of frizzled hair flew all over the place as he painfully replied, \u201cHe killed my elder brother! Killed him! I can\u2019t wait even a second longer, I\u2019m going to kill him now! Sacrifice him to my big brother in heaven!\u201d NanGong TianHu\u2019s face contorted into a ferocious expression, and he suddenly grabbed on NanGong Yu\u2019s throat. He started strangling her as he screamed with bloodshot eyes, \u201cNanGong Yu! If you\u2019re going to stop me from avenging my brother\u2019s death, then this old man will first settle you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough\u2026\u201d NanGong Yu struggled to breathe. Seeing that her uncle did not have any thoughts of placing her down, she could only weakly sputter out, \u201cOk\u2026 If you\u2019re willing to listen to my arrangement, then I can implement the revenge plan against Ling Tian, against the entire Ling Family!\u201d</p><br/><p>Peng! TianHu immediately threw her onto the ground, urging, \u201cHurry, tell me your plan now!\u201d</p><br/><p>As NanGong Yu picked herself up, a hint of despair could be seen in her eyes. However, she calmly replied, \u201cSecond Uncle, you need to first promise me that in this entire operation you will only listen to my orders. Only then will we even have the slightest chance at succeeding. If you decide to act alone, then I would rather use my authority as the Family Head to dissolve the NanGong Family, then to cause disaster! Or you could kill me now so that at least the NanGong Family will not be annihilated by my own hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong TianHu threw himself onto a chair, breathing heavily. Finally, he directed his ferocious gaze onto his niece, spitting out a long breath, \u201cSay it! I\u2019ll follow all your orders! I only wish for revenge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll along, we\u2019ve been working together with the Ling Family and furthermore have obtained quite the bit of benefit. While we\u2019ve paid a hefty price to do so, we\u2019ve managed to destroy the killer of my third brother, the Yang Family. Without the support from the Ling Family, it would be an impossibility of us to achieve that matter, let alone being able to take over their businesses afterward! We\u2019ve obtained quite a bit in return, does Second Uncle agree to that?\u201d As she spoke, NanGong Yu rubbed her neck. Under the force of NanGong TianHu, there was already a bruise forming.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what?\u201d NanGong TianHu blustered, \u201cJust for that little bit of benefit, how could it compare to the life of my brother? He is no longer in this world, so how could having so much benefit amount to?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another hint of sorrow passed through NanGong Yu\u2019s eyes. But upon seeing TianHu gradually compose himself, able to use his brain to think, she relaxed because she knew that she could finally get to him. \u201cThe cooperation between the two families is in the end based on benefits, and even in the end, the Ling Family made use of the Yang Family to destroy a large portion of our forces. To that point, we can say that it was our own just desserts since we did not harbor any good intentions. Do you agree with this too?\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong TianHu only snorted as he looked away.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s just like that, then that would be acceptable. After all, although we\u2019ve sacrificed a lot, we have also benefited equally. NanGong Yu\u2019s eyes were downcast, and it was unknown as to what she was thinking in her heart. However, the words coming out from her mouth were distinct and clear, \u201cBut, father just had to attempt to get a share of the profits when Justice was in pursuit of Ling Tian. This could be said to be a little insatiable.\u201d Upon seeing that her uncle was about to leap up, she immediately stretched her hand to gesture to him to sit back down, \u201cI know what father intended. Sky Bearing had already fallen, becoming the land of the Ling Family, and the huge benefits it offered would only benefit the Ling Family. Without Ling Tian, they would not be able to hold onto Sky Bearing for long. Furthermore, because we worked with him before, we understood his strength and accumulations. So long as he died, then with our partnership, we could take over a lot of businesses, and we would then rise to become a first-rate aristocratic family, comparable to the Yu and Xiao Families.\u201d</p><br/><p>She then sighed, \u201cI know that you two had this plan, and it was a good plan. Ling Tian escaping on his own, without any support, so long as he died, no one would know who killed him. Thus, so long as we played the part of the pursuers after Ling Tian, we would obtain the most benefits. Father was thinking for the Family, thus even though the plan was a little unscrupulous, it was acceptable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut now, Ling Tian has yet to die, but Father has already met his demise.\u201d NanGong Yu coughed twice, coldly remarking, \u201cThis matter was in the first place our fault, and I assume that Ling Tian already has implacable hatred towards us. Our two families are already conflicted with each other, and now my concern is that he will knock on our door at any time for revenge. I\u2019m thinking of how to protect the entire family, the thousands of lives in our family, but Second Uncle you are already thinking of taking revenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a deep hatred, who does not want revenge? However, our opponent is Ling Tian. Do you have any assurance to win?\u201d NanGong Yu looked at her uncle. \u201cYou\u2019ve also eaten his techniques before, so I won\u2019t request so much. So long as you have a 30% chance to kill Ling Tian, I\u2019ll mobilize all the family\u2019s strength to take revenge for you! But do you have that 30%? You have to be honest!\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong TianHu angrily grumbled, the flames of hatred in his eyes seemingly about to materialize, but he finally lowered his head in defeat. Forget about 30%, he did not even think of having half a percent chance of dealing with Ling Tian! Even if he wanted a pyrrhic victory, he needed a certain degree of strength. A pity, NanGong TianHu did not possess such strength, and even combining the entire strength of the NanGong Family, they might not even possess that capability!</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, do we just forget about this matter? Don\u2019t tell me my big brother, your father\u2026 died in vain?\u201d NanGong TianHu lowly spat out. His voice had already begun to tremble, as reality began to sink into him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could we forget it just like this?\u201d NanGong Yu viciously spoke. \u201cIf you want to seek revenge, I cannot stop you, and neither can I deal with Ling Tian. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that we cannot deal with the others. For example, Ling Tian\u2019s grandparents, parents, as well as his women!\u201d Upon touching on the topic of \u2018his women\u2019, NanGong Yu spat out word for word.</p><br/><p>NanGong TianHu\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cYour meaning is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had quite a bit of contact with Ling Tian back in Sky Bearing. He cares a lot for his family, as well as his women.\u201d NanGong Yu bit her lips, an icy expression on her face as she spoke, \u201cThis is especially so for the one closest to him, the lady called Ling Chen!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2026 the maid that serves Ling Tian? How could this be possible?\u201d NanGong TianHu shook his head vigorously. \u201cShe\u2019s just a serving maid, and even if Ling Tian dotes on her, there will not be of much use in dealing with her. Instead, we should be planning on how to get rid of Ling Xiao or his mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on the latest news, Ling Tian had left the operations of the Ling Family Courtyard completely to Ling Chen before he fled from Sky Bearing. It could have been that the situation was too dangerous at that time, but the fact is that Ling Chen is the sole controller of the entire place now!\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu continued in a low voice, \u201cThis also means that Ling Chen holds all the power of Ling Tian currently. The one that could make Ling Tian do so would definitely be his most trusted and most loved woman! So long as we can kill her, not only will we throw him into a living hell, but we can also cause all their operations to go into chaos. Once chaos rules, then that would be our true revenge plan. Based on this, even if Ling Tian fails to escape from the pursuit or is hunted down by someone else, we would still obtain the lion\u2019s share of the benefits. And those are the items that we most need currently!\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong TianHu sat in silence for what seemed like half a day before he finally understood the nuances behind the plan. He could not help but jump up in excitement. \u201cIngenious! Truly an ingenious plan!\u201d</p><br/><p>NanGong Yu let out a dry smile, a poisonous look within her eyes as she hissed, \u201cThe reason why I chose Ling Chen was that no one has seen her act before. In other words, this lowly bitch might not even know any martial arts. Even if she does, it is probably superficial, and for us who are lacking strength currently, this is the best advantage we have.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d NanGong TianHu\u2019s eyes grew brighter.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs such, our first objective should be Ling Chen, and only her. We cannot act directly against Ling Tian yet,\u201d NanGong Yu confidently said. \u201cRight now, in addition to lacking the strength to face off against Ling Tian, we still have to watch ourselves for fear of offending Beyond Heavens. We cannot afford to make more enemies!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThus, this matter has to be extremely secretive, and we cannot reveal any clues about us.\u201d NanGong Yu warned, \u201cIf not, Ling Tian\u2019s forces will come to look for us, and our family will be finished!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax. To kill such a small lass, if there was any slip-up, then your second uncle would have lived in vain these few years.\u201d NanGong Tianhu let out a vicious smile. Having learned that not only did his niece want to take revenge, but also had such an intricate plan thought out, he began to feel a little apologetic for his behavior previously, which led to him behaving more mildly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe might not be able to relax.\u201d NanGong Yu\u2019s face was heavy as she shook her head. \u201cSince Ling Tian has placed her in charge, there will definitely be outstanding bodyguards around her for protection! This matter may seem simple but it is in fact difficult to achieve. We have to be meticulous in our preparations, covering all loopholes before we take action.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat goes without saying!\u201d NanGong TianHu felt some disapproval in this but did not say it.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor this operation, I\u2019ll go together with Second Uncle!\u201d Pacing around the room, NanGong Yu could not bring herself to relax and lifted up her head to say. \u201cGet the two great deacons and two great elders of our family, as well as the various uncles to work together. Then we\u2019ll choose a few of the strongest disciples we have to carry out this task together. Our only objective is to ensure that the woman is thoroughly killed, without any loopholes for her to exploit!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

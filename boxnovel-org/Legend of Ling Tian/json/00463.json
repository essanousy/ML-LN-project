What\u2019s this about?!</em></p><br/><p>Ling Tian spat out a mouthful of spittle and looked up at the setting sun. Perhaps he would have to loosen his bones to vent this frustration.</p><br/><p>In the room next door, Ling Jian\u2019s miserable groan could be heard and Li Xue walked out of the room with a bowl of medicine and a trace of delight.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Are there any changes to Ling Jian\u2019s injuries?\u201d Ling Tian asked doubtfully. With Ling Jian\u2019s iron will, what would it take for him to cry out like that? Even if he is seriously injured now, he still should not be letting out such a miserable groan, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing much, I only punished him for his disrespect this morning.\u201d Li Xue said in a casual manner, \u201cAfter gently dislocating his lower jaw, I gave him a bowl of medicine. However, it may have been a little hot because it was freshly brewed,\u201d Li Xue said with a devilish grin. \u201cThis would definitely be good for his recovery.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k! Aren\u2019t you too good at creating trouble?!\u201d Ling Tian was dumbfounded, \u201cHe is still injured!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ling Tian entered, Ling Jian looked at him with a pitiful appearance. He then pleaded in a hoarse voice, \u201cYoung noble, can I drink my medicine on my own in the future? If not may young noble please come\u2026\u201d After letting out two coughs, he opened up his mouth and showed it to Ling Tian, \u201cTake a look, my tongue has been scalded to the point a layer of skin has fallen off. This lass is just too vicious\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian patted Ling Jian on the shoulders to comfort him as he said with a trace of pity, \u201cAh Jian, bear with it. Even I cannot afford to provoke that lass. Why did you have to go and provoke her? I am really helpless.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s eyes turned white as he landed unconscious on his bed in hopelessness.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>It was in the night and a black figure sped across the city like a shooting star. From the east to west of the city, from the south to north of the city, the figure darted around in a mysterious and untraceable manner.</p><br/><p>With Ling Tian\u2019s movement techniques and cultivation, he was not worried that the Yu Family experts stationed in the city would be able to detect him. If they were comparing short distance sprints, even the number one expert, Justice, would be in awe and would have to bite Ling Tian\u2019s dust.</p><br/><p>QianQian had given him five suspicious locations where the Above Heavens experts might be hidden, and Ling Tian had already investigated three of them. However, he had not found anything yet and was heading to the fourth location.</p><br/><p>The night winds blew gently past Ling Tian\u2019s face and Ling Tian felt as though he was presently gazing at the moon in an elegant pavilion. He felt as though he was about to be lifted up by the wind and blend into the heavens and earth. This mysterious feeling intoxicated Ling Tian and he felt as though every single cell of his was cheering excitedly. As Ling Tian stretched out his senses, the surrounding 100 feet was fully captured and he could feel every single blade of grass and every flower in his surroundings. This mysterious state continued to expand further and further\u2026</p><br/><p>Just when he was enjoying this feeling, Ling Tian felt a bang go off in his head and it was as though he had lost his consciousness and his own body. He suddenly felt as though he was high up in the sky, looking down at Bright Jade City from high above without a single corner escaping from his senses\u2026.</p><br/><p>In the city, there was a lightning-like figure weaving around the city in a ghostly manner. He was visible at times and invisible at other times, with his actions completely unpredictable.</p><br/><p>Noticing this extremely speedy figure, Ling Tian began to praise in his heart, What a fantastic movement technique! After taking a closer look, Ling Tian suddenly realized that this person\u2019s figure, sword-like eyebrows, and suave appearance were extremely familiar. <em>Isn\u2019t this me? What\u2026 just what is going on? Why can I see myself? Just where am I? Ling Tian was struck with fear. Just what is going on? Could it be\u2026</em></p><br/><p>Thinking about this, he suddenly felt a piercing pain in his mind and could not help but shut his eyes. When he opened his eyes again, Ling Tian realized that he was already back in his own body and no longer had the frightening view from before. However, that experience was carved deeply into his very soul.</p><br/><p><em>Was that just a dream? Could there be such a realistic dream? Could it be that I performed such an exquisite movement technique when I was unconscious? Then who am I? Who is he? Who is Ling Tian?</em></p><br/><p>Ling Tian stood rooted to the spot in a daze. Above him, the crescent moon was slowly emerging from behind the cover of the clouds and the moonlight shone onto his face on a comforting manner as though asking him to not think too much about the matter. Not too far away, a shadow was cast by a pomegranate tree and the shadow covered Ling Tian\u2019s figure as though giving him a space to think\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian took in a deep breath. It was obvious that he had entered into a mystical martial arts realm. Perhaps, that was the true realm of martial arts. Or perhaps, it was the realm of the \u2018Way\u2019! However, he was only able to enter that state for such a short period of time and he didn\u2019t have any clue or memory on how to enter that state again.</p><br/><p>Knowing that such a mysterious state exists in the martial arts world but being unable to enter it despite racking his brains for a method. This can probably be considered a huge torture as well right?</p><br/><p><em>I wonder if Justice has had such an experience?!</em></p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a bitter laugh. While he was able to enter such a mysterious realm in that short moment, he had also entered into an elusive state where he had forgotten about everything. He had completely forgotten that the purpose for his current trip was to search for the location of the Above Heavens experts. After this short moment of sprinting, he was completely clueless about where he was.</p><br/><p>Studying his surroundings carefully, Ling Tian rubbed his nose and let out a bitter laugh. Thankfully he came to his senses in time. If it was just a couple of seconds later, he would probably have barged into the Yu Residence already. The gigantic tree about 30 feet away of him reminded Ling Tian about how he had concealed himself in that tree and saved Ling Jian from the Yu Residence. Regardless of how outstanding his movement technique was or how fast his speed, it was impossible for him to not leave behind a trace and he would definitely be detected by XianTian experts!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian never imagined that he would unknowingly arrive outside the Yu Residence. <em>What a close call! However, it seems that this place should be part of the Yu Family\u2019s defense line right? Why was it so quiet?</em></p><br/><p><em>Yu ManLou wouldn\u2019t possibly make such an elementary mistake right?</em></p><br/><p>Just when Ling Tian was pondering over the matter, chattering could be heard from afar and a faint light flickered. After the light flickered, a few individuals walked out and the moment they walked out, Ling Tian could feel a few powerful auras being given out. It was as though these auras were trying to sweep the area for threats.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian crouched down low and hid behind the room without revealing even his eyes. He then heard the other party chattering but could not hear them very clearly.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian circulated his inner qi and focused all his attention on listening to what the other party was saying.</p><br/><p>The conversation was already nearing the end.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 if that\u2019s the case, may elder Chen please return. This little brat will definitely be careful and will not act rashly.\u201d A young voice sounded. While the voice was crisp and clear, it carried with it a gloomy tone that made one uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 third young noble is too courteous\u2026 the matter which you instructed us, we will\u2026 may young noble wait patiently\u2026 report success\u2026\u201d bits and pieces of their conversation could be heard and this voice was rougher and obviously older.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you\u2026 if\u2026 I will definitely\u2026 repay this favor\u2026\u201d the crisp voice respectfully sounded.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was circulating his inner qi at full force to hear the full conversation. However, the wind direction changed suddenly and the loud swooshing sound blocked the conversation.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a sigh, <em>It is impossible for one to go against the heavens.</em></p><br/><p>The two parties had gone their separate ways, and the door was shut again. The other party then held onto a lantern and walked towards the Yu Residence.</p><br/><p>Their footsteps were extremely quiet and if one did not pay close attention, he might only hear two footsteps. The footsteps of the young man in the middle were almost completely silent. It was obvious that he was a martial arts expert who wasn\u2019t too weak.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian carefully stuck his head out to take a look at the alley. If his guess wasn\u2019t wrong, they should be walking towards the Yu Residence. At that time, they would definitely pass by him, and he would be able to take a peek at their faces.</p><br/><p>Indeed, the footsteps came nearer and nearer. As the three of them turned into the alley, Ling Tian managed to catch a glimpse of the three individuals. The person in the middle was dressed like a rich young noble and looked to be around his twenties. He had a delicate appearance but looked a bit sickly. At the same time, he had a proud appearance as though he was a head above everyone else and had a trace of viciousness in his eyes. The two others walked on his left and right and Ling Tian guessed that they were definitely his trusted aides.</p><br/><p><em>Who is this young man? Acting so daringly in the territory of the Yu Family. Could it be\u2026</em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

Wait for a moment before asking Ling Jian and the rest to take action. There isn\u2019t a need to kill all the Yu Family members. You have to leave some alive to complain to Yu ManLou after all.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are always too crafty!\u201d Li Xue smiled and looked at the battlefield before her. She then said with a heavy tone, \u201cI am truly surprised. Despite Shui QianRou being in danger, not a single person even bothers rescuing her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shut his eyes and replied indifferently, \u201cNothing should go wrong. If Shui ManKong cannot even protect his own daughter, what right does he have to be the head of a family? Besides, it is also time for this conceited lady to be taught a lesson!\u201d</p><br/><p>The battle became more and more treacherous and Shui QianRou\u2019s sword was like the wind, drifting around unpredictably. She tried her best to avoid a frontal confrontation with Yu ZhanKong while tying him down and not allowing him to attack any of her Shui Family members. At this time, Shui QianRou\u2019s back was already filled with sweat and her inner qi was severely exhausted! That\u2019s right, Shui QianRou was indeed a rare martial art talent who had already reached the XianTian stage and was comparable to a top-notch expert in the world.</p><br/><p>However, Yu ZhanKong had been famous for a long time and was an Elder of the Yu Family. On top of that, he was appointed the leader by Yu ManLou in this trip to Sky Bearing. He went to Sky Bearing especially to deal with Ling Tian and how could such a figure be someone ordinary? At this moment, Shui QianRou could only rely on her nimble movements and sharp sword strikes to barely tie Yu ZhanKong down. However, winning against Yu ZhanKong was no more than a pipe dream!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s heart was already completely cold!</p><br/><p>The battle had already lasted for an hour and Shui QianRou had fought the strongest member of the Yu Family, Yu ZhanKong, from the very start! Up until now, the Shui Family experts were still engaged in their own battles and not a single expert of the Shui Family approached the battle radius of Shui QianRou and Yu ZhanKong! On the contrary, there would be a few Yu Family experts who would give Shui QianRou trouble from time to time. The six Yu Elders would only let out a heroic battle cry with their actions extremely elegant and had plenty of energy to spare. In this life or death battle between the two families where lives were lost and blood was spilled, these six old fellows still had the extra energy to display a majestic pose! As long as there was a Shui Family member who could no longer hold on, they would immediately rush to the rescue. However, they completely ignored Shui QianRou\u2019s situation and pretended as though they could not see a thing!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Shui QianRou finally understood that these men came to Sky Bearing not just to take care of her brother, Shui QianHuan, but also with the intention of taking care of her! If she were to die in this battlefield in the hands of the Yu Family\u2019s experts, it would be the best outcome for the few Shui Elders and the three Shui brothers! With the two children of the Shui Family Head dead, there wouldn\u2019t be anyone of direct descent from the Family Head! At that time, they would have no choice but to settle for one of the three Shui brothers! Once that happened, the authority of the Shui Family would shift hands and it was definitely a wonderful plan!</p><br/><p>Boundless rage could be seen in Shui QianRou\u2019s eyes and her heart was filled with endless grief! Just why did she place her life on the line to tie Yu ZhanKong down? Wasn\u2019t it so she could help alleviate the pressure on her Shui Family\u2019s troops? Wasn\u2019t it so they could finish the battle quickly and allow the Shui Family to have a foothold in Heavenly Star?</p><br/><p>However, the only thing she gained in exchange for all her effort was the schemes and abandonment of her family!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou was thoroughly disheartened! At this moment, she even had the thought of throwing her sword away and giving up the thought of resisting. She could then borrow Yu ZhanKong\u2019s hands to end this miserable life of hers!</p><br/><p>A couple of miserable groans sounded and a Yu Family expert collapsed onto the ground riddled with injuries. There were three fatal wounds on his body but the price of those wounds was that two Shui Family experts had taken a step onto the Yellow Springs Road before him!</p><br/><p>Blood sprayed all over the ground and the ground was also covered with silver, pearls, and gold. Being soaked in blood, these treasures were trampled on by the experts as though they were worthless garbage. When their life was placed in front of them, these treasures seemed so worthless and not a single person spared it a glance. All the Yu Family experts who were previously delighted about their newly gained riches were now throwing all of these riches away, afraid that the extra weight on their body would affect their movement techniques. The eyes of all the experts were bloodshot as they clenched their teeth and pounced forward towards their enemies like hungry wolves. Their brothers and comrades were dying beside them but not a single person had the extra energy to help each other.</p><br/><p>Countless corpses were littered all over the forest floor and even in death, the malevolent expressions on their faces could be seen. But after being trampled on by their comrades and enemies, all that was left of their corpses was a pile of mushy flesh!</p><br/><p>From the start of the battle until now, less than 400 of the initial 1100 Yu Family experts were left! As for the Shui Family, less than 700 of their 1300 experts were left! The ferocity of the battle could be easily imagined!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s inner qi was almost all exhausted and her swordplay was becoming increasingly messy. At the same time, her vision was also starting to become blurry and she could only defend herself with the innate reflexes of a martial artist. There suddenly seemed to be multiple Yu ZhanKongs in front of her and she was already at her wits end!</p><br/><p>A malevolent grin suddenly surfaced on Yu ZhanKong\u2019s face and he brandished his sword with full strength. His sword charged at Shui QianRou like the coming of a thunderstorm and he finally replaced defense with offense! Shui QianRou could barely receive two blows before her sword was sent flying from her hands. At the same time, her figure stumbled backward and she weakly collapsed onto the ground. Yu ZhanKong let out a vicious smile and his sword stabbed towards Shui QianRou\u2019s heart like a venomous snake emerging from its cave!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, three black-robed experts appeared like spirits with black masks covering their faces and a snow white sword in their hands. With a few clanging sounds, they deflected Yu ZhanKong\u2019s attack before sending their own swords towards Yu ZhanKong mercilessly!</p><br/><p>Yu ZhanKong was startled and he quickly retreated backward. Two of the black-robed experts dashed forward and unleashed a flurry of attacks which took Yu ZhanKong all he had to block them. The remaining black-robed expert grabbed Shui QianRou and shot towards the sky. After that, the other two experts quickly retreated and followed after and defended their retreat. After appearing with a stunning entrance, they escaped quickly without any hesitation!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?! Put our little princess down!\u201d The few Shui Family experts were immediately on full alert. They abandoned their opponents and chased after the three black-robed experts. With their bodies hanging in mid-air, they flung out flying daggers, sleeved darts and concealed caltrops towards the three escaping experts! The target of their attacks was actually the same! As long as these three experts couldn\u2019t block this wave of hidden weapons, Shui QianRou would definitely have to perish on the spot! Who knew if these six Elders were trying to save their little princess or murder her?!</p><br/><p>\u201cB*st*rds!\u201d The three black-robed experts let out an angry roar and brandished their swords in unison to form a powerful sword net, blocking all of the incoming hidden weapons. However, this action of theirs had given the six Elders a chance to catch up to them. The six Elders brandished their weapons and with sword qi flying in all directions, they did not give the three experts a chance to speak and attempted to kill them as quickly as possible!</p><br/><p>These six Elders had actually ignored their lifetime enemy, the Yu Family, but used all of their strength to stop these three experts instead! They knew that this was the final and best chance for them to get rid of Shui QianRou. After the battle today, they had thoroughly offended Shui QianRou and as long as she returned safely, none of them would be able to escape blame. Furthermore, Shui QianHu had already smashed Shui QianHuan to death. Regardless of whether or not that action was intentional, the deed was already done. Thus, to the six of them, Shui QianRou\u2019s death was even more important than the Yu Family members!</p><br/><p>The three black-robed experts let out a loud roar and matched blows with the six Shui Elders. The nine figures then flew back in opposite directions. After that, two of the black-robed experts joined their swords underneath the feet of the expert carrying Shui QianRou. With a loud shout, the black-robed expert carrying Shui QianRou suddenly shot out like a catapult and disappeared into the dense forest.</p><br/><p>The remaining two elders landed on the ground and their eyes glowed with anger underneath the mask. All of a sudden, the two of them growled, \u201cShui ManCheng, you\u2019re good!\u201d The words \u2018you\u2019re good\u2019 were said with their teeth being gnashed in extreme anger. The moment these words were said, the bodies of the six Shui Elders shook in unison.</p><br/><p>With a sneer, the two remaining black-robed experts ignored the miserable battle and disappeared into the forest as well. As for the six Shui Elders, they did not make a single move after hearing the words \u2018you\u2019re good\u2019. Instead, they looked at each other with a bitter expression on their faces.</p><br/><p>With the six Shui Elders leaving the battlefield, despite it being a short instant, it was enough to cause a drastic change to the battlefield! The many experts of the Yu Family felt a sudden decrease in pressure and immediately made their comeback. By the time the six Shui Elders returned to the battlefield, there were a full thirty more corpses on the battlefield!</p><br/><p>After the long battle, most of the experts no longer had much energy left. Both parties were fatigued and they only relied on their will and determination to continue the battle. Their attacks were no longer martial skills but only simple slashes and stabs. But even if this was the case, there were still many casualties generated in this short instant! Especially Yu ZhanShui and Yu ZhanKong, the two of them were acting like tigers as they reaped the lives of the Shui Family experts to their heart\u2019s content like they were dicing up vegetables.</p><br/><p>The six Shui Elders flew into a rage as the witnessed the situation and let out a frenzied roar, \u201cKill them all! Fight with all you\u2019ve got!\u201d They then led the charge.</p><br/><p>On the large pine tree, Ling Tian\u2019s lips curled up in disdain, \u201cFight with all you\u2019ve got? You guys make it seem as though they weren\u2019t giving it their all before this. All of your subordinates are exhausted to the point they are panting like dogs but you guys can still say something like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Young noble Ling sat atop the tree criticizing the battle beneath him in a leisurely manner. On his left was Xiao YanXue and on his right was Li Xue. Two beauties were beside him and he was truly leading the frivolous life! The thousand or so people below probably wouldn\u2019t believe that while they were killing to the point rivers of blood were being formed, there was still someone above them watching a good show! At the same time, he was still complaining about the fact that he did not have any good wine to go with this occasion and lamenting about the fact that he should not have finished his \u2018Hero\u2019s Blood\u2019!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still have the mood to care about this? Your beauty has already been kidnapped.\u201d Li Xue twitched her lips and ignored Ling Tian\u2019s grumbling.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter, Chen\u2019er has already followed after them. Didn\u2019t you notice that?!\u201d Ling Tian stroked his chin and laughed evilly. The instant the black-robed expert shot out into the thick woods, Ling Tian saw a faint shadow following after them. While they were too far away from the battlefield and the faint figure could not be seen clearly with even the gender unknown, Ling Tian could recognize Ling Chen with just his instinct alone after living together with her for more than ten years!</p><br/><p>After looking down at the increasingly crazy battle beneath him, Ling Tian raised his head up and looked towards the sky. He then closed his eyes and with a smile on his face, he said coldly, \u201cIt is about time. It is time for this battle to come to an end.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue nodded her head and with a wave of her hands, a sleeved dart shot towards the sky!</p></div>\n</div>"}

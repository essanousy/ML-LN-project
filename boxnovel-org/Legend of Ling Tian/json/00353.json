What plans?\u201d She knew that all the plans of the Yu Family would only come to fruition if Ling Tian left the Ling Residence or even the world\u2026 Thinking about that, how could Ling Chen not be devastated? How would she be able to think clearly?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a sigh, pulled her into his embrace, and patted her on the back. \u201cSilly lass, we can no longer avoid the matter and have to face it boldly! Since we cannot avoid the enemy, we have to use all we have to exterminate him! Life and death isn\u2019t anything big, so why should we be so bothered about it? Don\u2019t forget that when you first met your young noble, we were still kids and both the Yang and Imperial Families were far stronger than us at that time. However, what has happened now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen clenched her teeth and nodded her head as tears streamed down her cheeks. At the same time, her gaze also turned ice cold, \u201cNo matter who it is who wants to harm young noble, I will make sure they don\u2019t leave alive! At the very least, I will just accompany my young noble into the next life. As long as we can live and die together, death isn\u2019t scary at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian suddenly felt the temperature of his surroundings plunge down as the hot summer suddenly felt like the freezing chiller! Under Ling Chen\u2019s feet, a thick layer of ice had already been formed by the chilly killing intent rising from within her heart!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but be shocked. For the first time in her life, this gentle fairy had unleashed such a powerful wave of killing intent towards someone!</p><br/><p>The only reason was because the person wanted to harm Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>Also, this included Wei ChengPing from Northern Wei! This name was already engraved onto a \u2018list of death\u2019 in Ling Chen\u2019s heart! Ling Chen had already decided that the moment Ling Jian came out, the first mission for him would be the slaughter of Wei ChengPing and his imperial family! As long as Ling Jian were to let a single one remain alive, he would have let down the young noble\u2019s many years of teachings!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Yu Family has always faced difficulty in Sky Bearing for the past decade due to our interference. As long as they want to continue establishing ground in Sky Bearing, they would definitely have to do it in secret. However, it would be impossible for them to have a large foundation established. Thus, Sky Bearing is probably the only place in the whole continent where the Yu Family\u2019s strength is weak. After having many hidden confrontations, the Yu Family did not gain the upper hand and Sky Bearing has already turned into Yu ManLou\u2019s biggest worry! Even in his dreams, he would probably be thinking about how he can arrange a chess piece into the center of the continent! Thus, it wouldn\u2019t matter if the Yu Family doesn\u2019t come this time. But the moment they arrive, they would definitely launch a thunder-like move!\u201d Ling Tian paced around slowly as he continued pondering over just what the Yu Family\u2019s plan was.</p><br/><p>Behind him, a gust of wind sounded and Ling Tian\u2019s eyes erupted forth with killing intent!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, have you been well? An uninvited guest is here to disturb you.\u201d A crisp laugh sounded from behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Ye!\u201d Ling Tian turned around with excitement, \u201cI never imagined that you would be here at such a moment. What gust of wind brought you here today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen let out a smile and leisurely walked over. However, Ling Tian\u2019s acute senses could already detect a tinge of worry hidden in Ye QingChen\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother, this time, you are really in trouble. If you cannot get through this\u2026\u201d Ye QingChen shook his head and paused there.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh ah, it seems like older brother already knows that someone in your sect wants me dead,\u201d Ling Tian said with a calm smile. \u201cOlder brother can\u2019t possibly be here to carry out the mission right?\u201d As Ling Tian said that, Ling Chen began to grow nervous as she warily looked at Ye QingChen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat mission can only be carried out by the holder of the Martial Order Medallion. This old man has spent my whole life dwelling on other unimportant things and my martial arts achievement is extremely limited. How can I be the owner of the Martial Order Medallion?\u201d Ye QingChen said with a chuckle, \u201cIn every generation, there can only be a single owner of the Martial Order Medallion. His martial arts must definitely be at the peak with his medicinal skills reaching perfection. This old man is ashamed to say that my martial arts can only be considered a third-rate existence in the sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly a single person?\u201d Ling Tian said with a smile, \u201cIs he dressed in green?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d Ye QingChen laughed out loud, \u201cThat unreasonable nut is indeed usually dressed in green. I didn\u2019t expect you to have seen him already. How is he?\u201d Ye QingChen was obviously asking if the both of them had exchanged pointers before.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian responded by shaking his head, \u201cThe martial arts of that individual are far too powerful! For the next ten years, I won\u2019t be able to match up to him!\u201d Thinking for a while, Ling Tian added, \u201cIt would be impossible for me to deal with him, or even kill him now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him?\u201d Ye QingChen laughed, \u201cLittle brother, this older brother doesn\u2019t want to scare you but there probably isn\u2019t anyone capable of killing him in the world! His martial arts are undoubtedly the number one in the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then what is older brother\u2019s purpose for this visit? Is it to destroy the last shred of my confidence?! Or is it to lend me assistance to escape from the Martial Order Medallion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit dreaming.\u201d Ye QingChen rolled his eyes and scolded laughingly. His tone then turned serious as he said solemnly, \u201cLittle brother, this older brother is here to ask you something.\u201d Ye QingChen took a step forward and said with undisguised worry, \u201cFollow this old man and leave the conflict of the pugilistic world. Join me to carefreely roam the continent and enjoy the rest of your life. With little brother\u2019s cultivation, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible for you to ascend to immortality! How about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you agree, there wouldn\u2019t be a Ling Tian in the mortal world anymore and I would be in charge of talking to the Martial Order Medallion owner! There definitely wouldn\u2019t be a problem! Even if that murderous nut is completely heartless, he would still have to show this old man some face.\u201d</p><br/><p>In Ye QingChen\u2019s estimations, after making such an offer, the arrogant Ling Tian who had the ambition to rule the world, would probably respond with disdain or even fly into a rage. However, Ye QingChen really admired this youth in front of him and really wanted to save him from his current predicament. He had already thought of how he should deal with Ling Tian\u2019s reaction. If not for the fact that he had previously personally witnessed Ling Tian\u2019s stunning martial arts, he would probably have thoughts of kidnapping Ling Tian and taking him away.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian unexpectedly didn\u2019t reject him on the spot and fell into deep thought instead. After pacing around the courtyard for a while, he sat down on a bench below the rack of grapes and again fell into deep thought. He obviously didn\u2019t take Ye QingChen\u2019s words lightly and seemed to be considering something.</p><br/><p>A long while later Ling Tian asked, \u201cOlder brother, you exchanged pointers with this little brother back then as well. Do you really not think that I can triumph this time? Does this little brother not have even a chance to win?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen let out a long sigh and said, \u201cIf we didn\u2019t exchange pointers back then, I wouldn\u2019t be so worried. However, it is because little brother\u2019s strength is too stunning that I am afraid you wouldn\u2019t be willing to take a step back and would choose to fight to the death! As long as there exists a single trace of hope, I wouldn\u2019t be willing to do this either! Originally, if both parties can enter into the XianTian realm, as long as one party cannot win, it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for him to make a retreat. However, this person is an exception! You don\u2019t know just how frightening he really is until facing him yourself!\u201d After considering for a while, Ye QingChen said with difficulty, \u201cHe\u2026 he has already surpassed the realm of \u2018Martial Learning\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? He has already surpassed the realm of \u2018Martial Learning\u2019?\u201d Ling Tian frowned and drew a circle on the ground before saying in an indifferent manner, \u201cIt seems that he has entered into the \u2018Martial Way\u2019 realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?\u201d Ye QingChen was startled, \u201cYou already know about the\u2026 Martial Way realm?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right!\u201d Ling Tian put on a carefree smile and said, \u201cThe so-called martial arts can actually be split into four different realms. The common people are ignorant and think that a mere boxing routine or swinging their swords around can be considered the study of martial arts. However, they are extremely wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm? I would like to hear more.\u201d Ye QingChen also seemed to be puzzled. What Ling Tian had just said was also recorded in the records of Beyond Heavens but was vastly different. Thus, he couldn\u2019t help but ask with curiosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf one strengthens his body with martial arts and is capable of displaying a few boxing routines to become a street entertainer, that is the \u2018Martial Technique\u2019 realm. It is just a technique for people to earn their living and can barely be considered martial arts.\u201d Ling Tian said slowly, \u201cThat is the most shallow form of boxing and isn\u2019t anything special. When facing an opponent, if their opponent was an ordinary individual, it wouldn\u2019t matter much. But if they were to face a person who has truly cultivated proper martial arts, it would be useless. It is only good for entertaining people and putting up a show and can be said to be the lowest form of martial arts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe second category is the \u2018Martial Skill\u2019 realm. The eighteen martial weapons can be considered within it and someone who has trained to the second realm can enter the battlefield to kill their enemies. In other words, only the second realm of Martial Skill onwards has the ability to cause fatal damage. However, it can only amount to so much and even if one can be proficient in all eighteen weapons, he wouldn\u2019t be considered much!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for the third category, it is the \u2018Martial Learning\u2019 realm. It includes the martial techniques that the men from the pugilistic world use.\u201d Ling Tian said with a proud smile, \u201cMartial arts is a type of science and one has to use his whole life to explore and research it. Only when one reaches such a realm would he be able to compare martial arts as a scholarly art. In the world today, there probably aren\u2019t many who have achieved such a realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then lifted his head up and smiled at Ye QingChen, \u201cBrother Ye is a good example. Only those who enter the XianTian realm can be barely considered to be part of the Martial Learning realm. As for the others, there isn\u2019t even a need to talk about them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, the highest realm of martial arts is called the \u2018Martial Way\u2019!\u201d Ling Tian said with a serene expression, \u201cThe way of martial arts! This is a realm that one can only look at but not attain! Of the millions of martial arts practitioners in the world, it would be rare to see even a single person attain this realm! The Martial Way realm emphasizes becoming one with the world. Perhaps one wouldn\u2019t be capable of moving the mountains and controlling the oceans, but he would be able to take a peek into the heavenly ways! I never imagined that there was someone in the world who has achieved such a realm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen was shocked to the point he couldn\u2019t say a thing. Ling Tian\u2019s explanation was almost identical to what was recorded in Beyond Heavens and was even more detailed. However\u2026 the records of Beyond Heavens were written by generations of peerless martial arts experts! Just how was Ling Tian able to know all of this despite his young age?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, she never expected that after waiting for a long time, Ling Tian was still nowhere to be seen! She could not help but be filled with anxiousness as she cursed in her heart, Unromantic pig head! Darn pig head! Stinky lecher! Idiotic Ling Tian! Why don\u2019t you understand the thoughts of a lady? See if this lady here will still bother about you in the future!</p><br/><p>Just when she was stomping her feet and cursing Ling Tian, she suddenly felt the color of the sunlight shining into her tent changing color and her surroundings turning cold. She could not help but raise her head in shock and realized that the sunlight had turned into a jade green color. She was completely astounded and could not be bothered about the embarrassment she felt and rushed out of the tent.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the little pond that she and Ling Tian previously fell into had been completely transformed. The originally clear spring water had turned dark green like it was a gigantic piece of jade. In fact, the surrounding forest had also turned dark green in color and the sun\u2019s rays that were reflected from the forest had also turned green. At this moment, Xiao YanXue felt as though she was in a dreamlike realm and everything around her felt completely unreal.</p><br/><p>Being unable to find Ling Tian, Xiao YanXue grew anxious and looked at the empty mountains around her, unable to find another person besides herself. With the strange scene in front of her, Xiao YanXue suddenly felt an unknown sense of fear as her heart began thumping rapidly. At the same time, tears began welling up in her eyes and she was about to burst out wailing again.</p><br/><p>As she took a look at the jade green pond, Xiao YanXue realized that there seemed to be a figure lying in the pond and almost shouted out in surprise. Upon taking a careful look, she realized that the person in the pond was Ling Tian! The shock which she felt was not to be underestimated! Could it be that something untoward happened to him as a result of falling into the pond before his injuries were recovered? Xiao YanXue burned with anxiety and was about to immediately jump right into the pond.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Xiao YanXue saw that Ling Tian\u2019s arm was raised in the pond as though he was holding onto something and studying it carefully. At the same time, Ling Tian\u2019s eyes were also opened with his eyeballs darting around. At the same time, the unknown object in Ling Tian\u2019s hand was also glowing with a brilliant green splendor. Xiao YanXue immediately understood that this strange scene in front of her was a result of Ling Tian and heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue knew that Ling Tian was definitely doing something important at the moment, and as a reasonable lady, she would naturally not disturb him at this moment. Thus, she sat down by the pool instead and with a change in mental state, she suddenly felt the previously eerie scene in front of her to be incredibly enchanting instead. A mesmerizing smile surfaced on her lips as she hugged her knees and admired the beautiful scenery in front of her. Thinking about how this amazing scene was created by her beloved man and that she was the only one here to witness it, her heart was immediately overwhelmed with sweetness. From time to time, she would turn her head to look at Ling Tian with a smile full of bliss.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian, who was underwater, was trying his best to hang in there. While he still had plenty of inner qi leftover, he was running out of breath. After holding his breath in for a long time, Ling Tian\u2019s face was already turning red. After all, even Ling Tian did not imagine that investigating a piece of jade pendant would take such a long time!</p><br/><p>Despite it just being a short moment, Ling Tian felt as though a full year had passed! Finally, the two hexagonal black dots from the jade pendants gradually combined together. At the moment both the black dots merged together successfully, an intense whirlpool was gathered at the jade pendant and the jade pendant flashed with a brilliant splendor for a single instant before the two black dots disappeared completely!</p><br/><p>Replacing the two black dots instead was the shape of a longsword. It was slender and narrow, and was the exact mini replica of the Heaven Splitter! Following that, a few rows of words began appearing below the body of the sword. The stroke of the words was thin like hair and each word was only the size of a sesame seed.</p><br/><p>It seems that the thousand-year-old mystery will be solved at this moment!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian suppressed the agitation in his heart and the discomfort in his body. Keeping his eyes wide open, he refused to let go of any word.</p><br/><p>A short sixteen words written in two rows entered Ling Tian\u2019s mind, \u201cVacant in the East, Heaven and Earth Essence; Sharpness of Heaven Splitter, It Can Be Fought!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian muttered these sixteen words under his breath over and over again and felt completely confused. Before he could have an idea of what those words meant, he felt the jade pendant in his hands explode silently as though it had melted into the spring water and disappeared without a trace!</p><br/><p>The spring water which was dark green to the point it was almost black had suddenly regained its clarity! It was as though nothing had happened in the first place at all. Ling Tian could not help but be dumbfounded. At the same time, the sixteen words were imprinted deeply in his mind and he would never forget them!</p><br/><p>Just when Xiao YanXue was admiring the beautiful scenery in front of her, the scenery suddenly disappeared and she could not help but be startled. Before she had the chance to turn around, she heard a splashing sound from the pond behind her and Ling Tian dashed out from the pool to a full fifty feet above the water. Following that, he landed beside Xiao YanXue and began panting heavily. However, not a single sign of fatigue could be seen in his face.</p><br/><p>Just what was going on?!</p><br/><p>However, the wise Xiao YanXue had always known that she should not interfere in the affairs of men and would thus not take the initiative to ask. She would only give Ling Tian care and concern at the appropriate time and it was the best way to show support for him!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian looked at the pond water in a daze and rubbed his right finger with his thumb with an indescribable feeling in his heart. The originally solid jade pendant that was in his hand just a while ago and absorbing his inner qi had suddenly exploded\u2026 Err, no. It didn\u2019t explode but melted in his hand instead. Perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be accurate to say that it melted either. It was as though it was a snowball being thrown into a hot furnace, disappearing into nothingness in just an instant without a drop of water being left behind.</p><br/><p>The instant before it disappeared, Ling Tian could clearly feel his fingers trembling slightly. Ling Tian originally thought that this mysterious event had evolved and the jade pendant had melted into his body. But after thinking about it carefully, that was definitely not the case.</p><br/><p>Just what was going on with the jade pendant? Why did it not react to anyone else\u2019s inner qi but react to mine? Just what was that black dot? What is with the words inside the jade pendant? Was it engraved by someone? Isn\u2019t this whole incident just too puzzling?</p><br/><p>Is this the thousand-year-old mystery?!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shook his head violently. Even with the technology of his previous life, it was impossible to perform such a feat. Engraving words within a jade pendant without damaging the body of the jade. Furthermore, the words even disappeared after being engraved without a single trace being left behind. On top of that, both the jade pendants had reacted like they were a pair of lovers\u2026</p><br/><p>It was just too mystical!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Ling Tian\u2019s eyes widened, Could it be\u2026 to be able to perform what humans are unable to do so\u2026 a celestial? Ling Tian shook his head with a self-mocking smile. How could it be possible? This world does not even have a temple or any celestial legends. Even the level of martial arts in this world was far from the level of martial arts in his previous life. If there were celestials in this world, how could there be no legends about them?</p><br/><p>You have to know, even celestials had to be human once and they would naturally not be willing to stay lonely. Ling Tian suddenly began laughing at this own thoughts. Since he could not figure out an answer, he decided to not think about it anymore. Very quickly, Ling Tian\u2019s attention was drawn to the sixteen words in the jade pendant again. The first thing Ling Tian felt when seeing the words was that those words were completely irrelevant to ruling over the world but describing a treasure chest instead.</p><br/><p>\u2018Vacant in the East\u2019 probably described the Mount Vacant Sky in the east of Heavenly Star. But what did \u2018Heaven and Earth Essence\u2019 mean? The essence energy of heaven and earth? If that was the case, could it mean that there was a treasure which contained the essence energy of the heaven and earth in Mount Vacant Sky? However, \u2018Sharpness of Heaven Splitter, It Can Be Fought\u2019 was completely irrelevant to that.</p><br/><p>Just what was kind of a special meaning was there behind describing the sharpness of a sword?</p><br/><p>From whatever which had just happened, it was obvious that there was a huge relationship between the two Heaven\u2019s Heart Jades and the Heaven Splitter. It was as though there was an inseparable relationship between the three items\u2026</p><br/><p>With a flick of his wrist, the Heaven Splitter was unsheathed from its sheath and the body of the sword shone brightly, reflecting the clear spring water. The sword lay silently in Ling Tian\u2019s hand and Ling Tian observed it silently with a smile. \u201cBrother, are you feeling lonely? Don\u2019t worry, you can follow me from today on. The only reason why a treasured sword can be called a treasured sword is because it requires endless slaughter and pools of blood to nurture. After being hidden for so many years, you must be unwilling to stay silent any further. Being in Justice\u2019s hands, you are completely useless with his unparalleled martial arts and you must be thirsty for action.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Heaven Splitter suddenly began glowing brightly but yet silently. It was as though the Heaven Splitter was a lonely king proudly facing the world, desolate and unyielding.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed out loud and crazily imbued his inner qi into the body of the sword. With a loud keening sound, the body of the sword lit up and a bloody fishy smell of slaughter filled the place! A sharp sword qi shot towards the heavens with killing intent shooting out in all directions! The clouds in the surrounding dispersed in all directions as though a slumbering demon dragon had escaped from depths of the ravine. Facing the boundless wilderness, vast mountains and millions of living beings, the demonic dragon revealed its malevolent teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood sword! Good partner!\u201d Ling Tian praised, \u201cAmbition to will the heavens, sword to split the heavens! The both of us are a match made in heaven! Hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou you you\u2026\u201d Xiao YanXue was dazzled by her beloved\u2019s man heroic disposition and could not help but be intoxicated. At the same time, she realized that Ling Tian\u2019s scabs began breaking off like a turtle shell and began dropping onto the ground. Ling Tian\u2019s smooth and clean arm was then revealed as though it was never injured before\u2026 Xiao YanXue\u2019s eyes almost bulged out as she speechlessly pointed at Ling Tian.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

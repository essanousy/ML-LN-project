Especially if they knew that the Xiao Family\u2019s 450,000 men army was destroyed which destroyed the plans of their Above Heavens, what would they do?</p><br/><p>Even if they used their knees to think, it was obvious that these fellows would not let the matter rest so easily! They would definitely take revenge on the Ling Family in an almost maniacal manner! This was also the outcome which Yu ManLou wanted to witness.</p><br/><p>Regardless of who won or loss, it would be to Yu ManLou\u2019s benefit!</p><br/><p>Looking at the flashing lights in front of them, Ling Tian felt a faint sense of unease in his heart and let out a sigh. He quickly settled his fluttering heart and focused his attention to barbecuing his meat. Right at this moment, the beauty in his heart moved slightly. Currently, Li Xue was leaning in Ling Tian\u2019s embrace with supple chest sticking closely to Ling Tian\u2019s crotch. With this slight movement of hers, a demonic fire rose in his heart and little Ling Tian immediately stood up straight. A wave of comfort flowed up from his crotch to his head and Ling Tian took in a breath of cold air.</p><br/><p>Forcefully suppressing the unstable mental state of his, Ling Tian quickly changed the topic and asked, \u201cDid the Shui Family members make any huge movement recently?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShui Family members? Hahaha\u2026\u201d Li Xue burst out laughing, \u201cThey are extremely obedient now. Ever since you constructed for them a Shui Family Courtyard before you left, they all became extremely motivated. This was related to the future of their ambitions, how would they not be motivated? How would they have the energy to do anything else? Furthermore, in our territory, their eyes would be blinded and ears blocked. What else do you think they can do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a cunning smile, \u201cThen\u2026 what about the other matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue snorted and rolled her eyes, \u201cI originally did not think that your plan would work but those Shui Family trashes actually followed what you said step by step. But with Shui QianRou aiding you from within the family, it would be strange if things didn\u2019t go your way. One thousand and two hundred members of the Shui Family came to Heavenly Star and after ambushing the Yu Family, almost 900 had perished. Of the few elders that came to Heavenly Star, one died and two were seriously injured. Most of their strength was wiped out and the fighting spirit which they came with had also been extinguished. Currently, they no longer had the strength to negotiate with the Ling Family. If we want to talk about troubles, it would be the other two Shui Family young noble trying to fight for authority. But with just the two of their abilities, they would always be thoroughly enraged by us and leave in defeat. Hahaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>With a smile, Li Xue continued, \u201cAmong the Shui Family forces in Sky Bearing, Shui QianRou had the absolute authority. Even though the other elders and young nobles of the Shui Family was unresigned, they had no other choice. Shui QianRou had our complete support and we would not listen to anyone else. Thus, even if they weren\u2019t willing to accept Shui QianRou\u2019s lead, they had no choice but to submit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stroked his chin and chuckled. Since they wanted to push Shui QianRou up to the position of Shui Family Head, they naturally needed to create prestige for her by helping her accomplish some feats and merits. At the same time, they also had to help her create a base in Heavenly Star which completely belonged to the Shui Family. All of these years, the Shui Family had been trying to set up a base in Heavenly Star but they had never managed to succeed. Now that Ling Tian handed such a big accomplishment to Shui QianRou, Shui QianRou\u2019s status in the Shui Family would definitely rise up quickly.</p><br/><p>With Ling Tian\u2019s protection, it would be almost impossible for the Yu Family to disrupt them.</p><br/><p>Naturally, in order to allow Shui QianRou\u2019s position to become stabilized, Ling Tian made extremely meticulous arrangements. After their battle with the Yu Family in the Black Pine Forest, the Shui Family was completely bankrupted\u2026 When they were doing battle with the Yu Family, their residence in Sky Bearing was robbed\u2026</p><br/><p>This thief cleaned out every single last possession of the Shui Family members and did not even leave behind a single piece of undergarment! Helpless, the Shui Family could only seek help from the Ling Family Courtyard. Ling Chen naturally rejected them without any hesitation. Then, both parties had a three day long discussion and the disciples of the Shui Family had suffered for a full three days. Especially the First Elder of the Shui Family who cared the most about his face and bearing\u2026</p><br/><p>Their food and accomodation was provided by the Ling Family and they didn\u2019t need to worry about it. However, they just returned from the battlefield and were all riddled with injuries. They needed medicine to treat their injuries! However, all the medicine shops in Sky Bearing refused to sell them any medicine. The Ling Family Courtyard also rejected to help them\u2026</p><br/><p>Err, in actual fact, the medicine shop didn\u2019t exactly refuse to sell them anything. They just inflated the price up by a hundred to thousand times. Despite spending more than ten thousand taels of silver, Shui QianHai was only able to buy three bottles of medicine. This profligate Young noble was angered to the point he cursed for a full four hours\u2026</p><br/><p>Helpless, the two Shui Young Nobles could only pluck up their courage to seek assistance from the Ling Family Courtyard. They did not even have the chance to meet Ling Chen and Ling Feng rejected them without hesitation. After which, the few Shui Family Elders could only put aside their faces to visit the Courtyard. While they were able to meet Ling Chen, she mercilessly rejected any form of aid\u2026</p><br/><p>Finally, the Shui Family had no choice but to invite Shui QianRou to seek aid from the Ling Family. When she first sought an audience with Ling Chen, she was locked out of the Courtyard mercilessly. After which, she waited outside the Courtyard for a full night and it was said that Miss Ling Chen was extremely moved by her actions. The Ling Family then sent physicians and medicine to the Shui Family. As such, the inflated prices quickly returned back to normal\u2026</p><br/><p>Then, the Shui Family brought up the matter of building a base for the Shui Family in Heavenly Star. Naturally, Shui QianHai and Shui QianJiang was completely useless in the negotiation process and the Shui Family Elders were treated like air. As such, the Shui Family could only plead with Shui QianRou to carry out negotiations with the Ling Family. Shui QianRou took action again and the negotiations naturally went smoothly\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone obviously knew that the Ling Family was intentionally supporting Shui QianRou. However, even if they knew that, they were completely helpless and could only play along with the Ling Family. This matter was far too important after all\u2026</p><br/><p>With a first, there would be a second and Shui QianRou\u2019s authority in the family grew everyday. With Shui QianRou working together with the Ling Family, the Ling Family generously took out large amounts of silver to build the Shui Family Courtyard. With a wave of her sleeves, Shui QianRou signed a 50,000,000 loan agreement with the Ling Family. Despite the Shui Family Elders being enraged by the large amount, they did not dare to voice a single word of complaint. As for Ling Chen, she claimed that 300,000,000 taels of silver would be needed and the few old fogies were frightened to the point they almost went crazy. Using Li Xue\u2019s words, she called it psychosis!</p><br/><p>This 50,000,000 debt was properly recorded and calculated under the eyes of everyone present. From the materials used to the manpower costs and land cost, everything was calculated clearly. Everything was done out in the open with all the members of the Shui Family as witness. However, this was not because the Ling Family was afraid of the Shui Family reneging on their debts.</p><br/><p>Currently, even if the Shui Family Head were to personally arrive, his status probably wouldn\u2019t be that much higher than Shui QianRou\u2019s. Who would dare to go against her words? As long as Shui QianRou threatened to make the Ling Family stop all of their provisions and even stop work, all of the old fogies in the Shui Family would shut up immediately. Similarly, whenever there was a problem, only Shui QianRou would be capable of solving it. There was once where Shui QianHai argued with Shui QianRou for a bit and the thousand plus workers squatted on the ground together the very next afternoon. Upon asking them why they weren\u2019t working, they all complained that they were suffering from athlete\u2019s foot. As such, they all stopped work for two days\u2026</p><br/><p>A thousand plus people suffering from athlete\u2019s foot at the same time, such a ridiculous excuse angered all of the Shui Family Elders into sickness\u2026</p><br/><p>After the Shui Family pleaded with the Ling Family and paid a large amount of medical bills, which was naturally paid on credit as well, Shui QianRou\u2019s prestige was like the sun in the sky but the loans of the Shui Family grew thicker and thicker\u2026</p><br/><p>Actually, Shui QianRou had already thought things through. With their debts accumulating to such a point, any more wouldn\u2019t be too much of a difference. Shui QianRou had signed off the debts to the point where she was extremely used to it. Even her personal guards would carry with her ink and brush wherever she went\u2026</p><br/><p>Hearing Li Xue\u2019s narration, Ling Tian laughed to the point he almost fell down. Finally, Li Xue snorted, \u201cBefore I went out, the debts of the Shui Family accumulated to almost 200,000,000 taels of silver. By the time the Shui Family Courtyard is built, it would probably increase by many times over. I am afraid that even if you sell away all of these Shui Family members, they would not be able to repay the debt. It seems like the Shui Family princess can only repay off the debts with her body. This would definitely be to the liking of young noble Ling Tian.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Li Xue\u2019s dangerous tone, Ling Tian felt his back turn cold. Li Xue then grunted, \u201cShui QianRou could naturally understand this fact herself. If you ask me, that lass is probably extremely willing to sign as many loans as she can. If she doesn\u2019t sign any loans in a single day, she would look at Ling Chen with a tinge of bitterness. It seems like this lass is extremely clear about that but she would still work together with Ling Chen. Hmph hmph hmph, this is a super big spy hiding within the Shui Family. Young noble Ling, you truly have great fortune.\u201d Li Xue\u2019s eyes narrowed and said with a sarcastic tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough cough\u2026\u201d Ling Tian coughed ptitfully and laughed dryly, \u201cThe meat is cook, cough cough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue rolled her eyes, \u201cThat\u2019s right, the \u2018meat\u2019 is cooked and we can finally eat it. Congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was completely defeated\u2026</p><br/><p>Li Xue plucked off a leg of the roasted boar and blowed on it twice. She then acted as though he was intoxicated and said, \u201cThis \u2018meat\u2019 is truly fragrant. It is truly quality meat of Heavenly Wind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian let out a groan and cupped his ears with agony. A woman is truly scary when she is jealous. Regardless of whether it is in this lifetime or his previous, regardless of whether it was a foolish or educated woman, there wouldn\u2019t be an exception\u2026</p><br/><p>A rustling sound could be heard from the forest by the side of the road and both Ling Tian and Li Xue stood up immediately. Without any breeze in the sky, why would there be rustling sound from the forest? If there was an enemy, for him to be able to approach them without them knowing, his strength was not to be underestimated!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow fragrant, how fragrant. It must definitely be some good quality stuff.\u201d Knowing that he was already detected, he let out a laugh and three people walked out from the forest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is actually old brother Ye.\u201d Ling Tian\u2019s expression relaxed.</p><br/><p>The one who was speaking was dressed like a fortune teller with a staff in his hands. His face was lean but his eyes was glowing with energy. He drifted out of the forest as though there was a spatial door in the forest. This person was the green robed fortune teller, Ye QingChen. Beside him, there were two others. One was dressed in a set of white scholarly robes with a smile on his face as he waved a fan in his hand. He was dressed like a penniless scholar but he looked at Ling Tian with an arrogant gaze as though he was an emperor up above. The other person was short and pudgy and was raggedly dressed like a woodcutter with beard all over his face. However, this person looked at Ling Tian with an unfriendly look as though he was facing an enemy.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was naturally clear about Ye QingChen\u2019s strength. It wouldn\u2019t be much if Ye QingChen was alone but there was currently another two individuals beside him and the three of them had came together. For both him and Li Xue to not notice their presence, it only meant that the two others were at least as strong as Ye QingChen. According to Ling Tian\u2019s judgement, the strength of the other two was very likely to be even higher than Ye QingChen! The formation of these three individuals could be described as luxurious!</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen took off the wine gourd on his back and laughed, \u201cOver the past half a year, little brother\u2019s name resounded in the entire continent and this elder brother is extremely gratified. Let me offer you a toast! A pity that we do not have Man\u2019s Blood with us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s brows furrowed and could not understand the intentions of the three in front of him. Carefully, he probed, \u201cMy life was almost lost in the process and it was truly a miserable half year. I am not worthy of a toast from big brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen smiled and before he could say a thing, the short woodcutter dressed man pointed at Ling Tian and roared, \u201cLing Tian, where is Justice? Rumors are spreading all across the world that you have killed him. Is that true?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was stunned for a moment and understood the intentions of these three individuals. It turns out that the rumors which he had spread had created such a huge trouble for himself. The other two individuals must definitely be the experts of Beyond Heavens as well. If the three of them were to join hands to deal with him, it would definitely be troublesome for him as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I ask senior for your name?\u201d Ling Tian smiled and looked at the woodcutter. Despite a smile being on his face, his eyes was filled with calmness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy the f**k do you need to know what this daddy\u2019s name is? Let me ask you, were you the one who killed Justice?\u201d The woodcutter glared at Ling Tian ferociously and his killing intent was locked onto Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>The way this fellow spoke was truly too adorable. Previously, he was asking if Ling Tian killed Justice or not. From these words, Justice may still be alive but the very next moment, this fellow asked if Ling Tian was the one who killed Justice. In just a couple of seconds, Justice had went from being alive to dead\u2026</p><br/><p>Aren\u2019t you thinking too highly of me?!</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial Order Medallion owner, Justice?\u201d a glow flashed past Ling Tian\u2019s eyes, \u201cEven if I said that I killed Justice, would you believe me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The woodcutter shook his head, \u201cThis daddy wouldn\u2019t believe it! How can a gigolo like you kill that fellow?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you don\u2019t believe me, then why are you here for? Are you here just to seek trouble with me?\u201d Ling Tian glared, \u201cDo your Beyond Heavens really think that I am someone easily bullied?\u201d A tyrannical aura suddenly exploded forth and an endless killing intent gushed out from Ling Tian, breaking the aura which the woodcutter had locked onto Ling Tian. The powerful aura smashed towards the woodcutter without any restraint!</p><br/><p>The woodcutter\u2019s face turned red and knew that the little brat in front of him had caught onto his faulty wording. Right when he was about to retort, he felt a powerful aura breaking through his aura and pressed towards him. He immediately knew that Ling Tian was a powerful opponent and did not dare to delay. His aura was instantly pushed to its peak and his killing intent also oozed out without restrain.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian glared at the woodcutter in front of him and snorted, \u201cHmm?!\u201d His body then leaned forward slightly.</p><br/><p>The woodcutter\u2019s face turned purple and he let out roar in retaliation. Only after taking three to four steps back could he stabilize himself. Raising his head up to look at Ling Tian, a solemn expression could be seen on his face.</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen and the white robed scholar by the side was actually completely unaffected by Ling Tian\u2019s aura! Despite his exploding aura, he was actually able to lock it onto a single person! Ye QingChen and the white robed man looked at each other and shock could be seen on their faces.</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen hurriedly said, \u201cLittle brother, don\u2019t be angry. We are only here to seek some clarification. It would naturally be the best if this matter isn\u2019t true. Ah ah, you don\u2019t need to mind. However, just where is that crazy guy at right now? The head of two empires have taken out their Martial Order Medallions but this fellow disappeared at such a moment. This\u2026 this is just too much. Naturally, my fellow sect mates are also extremely anxious. But right at this moment, such a piece of news was actually spread out from Sky Bearing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shook his head and laughed, \u201cOld brother Ye, even if others do not know my strength, aren\u2019t you familiar with it? With my strength, do you really think that I am capable of killing Justice? Aren\u2019t you thinking too highly of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The woodcutter walked forward with his face flushed red and shouted, \u201cYour strength isn\u2019t too weak either. Apart from Justice, this daddy here has not met anyone else who has such strength. Although you are still a distance away from him, you can already be considered a peerless expert. A man must act in an open manner! If you say that he isn\u2019t dead, then where is he right now? At the very least, you should be the last person who met him right?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing Ye QingChen, Ling Tian would naturally not be disrespectful. But facing the woodcutter, Ling Tian would not show any mercy. With a sneer, he said, \u201cHow do I know where he is? The world is such a big place and if he chooses to hide in a random brothel, who would be able to find him? This young noble had always liked cleanliness and would never visit a brothel. As your fellow sect mate, shouldn\u2019t you guys know where his little lover is?\u201d</p><br/><p>The woodcutter was stunned for a moment and roared, \u201cThis daddy has never visited brothels before. How would I know where his little lover is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPuchi\u2026\u201d Ye QingChen\u2019s mouthful of wine was spit onto the fire in front of him and a greenish flame rose, \u201cCough cough cough\u2026\u201d Ye QingChen began coughing incessantly.</p><br/><p>The white robed scholar by the side shook his head helplessly as though he ate ecstasy.</p><br/><p>Hearing the burly\u2019s man rude tone, Li Xue was already about to explode. But upon hearing what the burly man ended up saying, Li Xue laughed to the point her sides ached.</p><br/><p>The woodcutter looked at the others with a puzzled expression, \u201cWhat are you guys laughing about? Old Ye, you are the closest to that crazy man. Do you know who his little lovers are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye QingChen glared, \u201cI only know who your little lovers are! You only know how to throw my face. Shut your mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>The woodcutter face flushed red, \u201cYe QingChen, I will fight you to the death! You actually dare to smear me for having a little lover? Don\u2019t you know that this daddy here cultivates the Celibate Formula? I am a virgin from head to toe!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Ling Tian immediately choked on air.</p><br/><p>Even though this fellow seemed looked extremely ferocious and unreasonable, he was actually a fool. Thinking about that, the anger in Ling Tian\u2019s heart was dissipated.</p><br/><p>The white robed scholar sighed and flapped his fan, \u201cJustice definitely isn\u2019t dead. That fellow is probably is closed door cultivation and there isn\u2019t a point for us to search for him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Ye QingChen and the woodcutter asked together. Not to mention the both of them, even Ling Tian was also puzzled about why this scholar was so certain. Since he could be so certain, then why did they still bother searching for him?</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at that sword.\u201d the white robed scholar pointed to the sword on Ling Tian\u2019s back, \u201cIf Justice is dead, how would this sword be on Ling Jian?\u201d The two of them let out an \u2018oh\u2019 together and the way they saw Ling Tian became different.</p><br/><p>This time, it was Ling Tian who became puzzled and he asked, \u201cWhy is this so? If I were to kill Justice and steal his sword, wouldn\u2019t it make even more sense? For you guys to see this sword, shouldn\u2019t you guys suspect me even more? Why has it become the evidence for him to wash of his crimes?\u201d</p><br/><p>The white robed scholar smiled and said proudly, \u201cBecause this is the Heaven Splitter. Justice would rather destroy it then lose it. If he knows that he is going to die, even if he has to let go of his chance to escape, he would first destroy this sword. Since this sword is currently with you, it would only mean that he handed it over to you willingly. Apart from this, there isn\u2019t any other possibilities. Besides that, even if your strength is above ours, it is still a distance from Justice. It is impossible for you to take his life and steal his sword!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian nodded his head and said, \u201cI see.\u201d</p><br/><p>The white robed scholar studied Ling Tian carefully before saying calmly, \u201cThis is probably the reason why he wasn\u2019t willing to accept the Martial Order Medallion. Since he gave this sword to you, it means that our sect has given the world to you. If that\u2019s the case, then there isn\u2019t any purpose for the Martial Order Medallion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh?!\u201d Ling Tian gasped in surprise. He never expected that Justice handing the Heaven Splitter to him had such a meaning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does it mean to be the Martial Order Medallion owner? It means that the person who he points at would be the ruler of the world! For Justice to give the sword to you, it means that he has appointed you as the ruler of the world!\u201d The white robed man laughed with pity, \u201cThis fellow indeed chose someone with a thicker killing intent than himself.\u201d His tone was filled with the regret of a bright pearl falling into darkness. Obviously, he was displeased with Justice choosing Ling Tian</p><br/><p>\u201cF**k!\u201d Ling Tian cursed, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, why don\u2019t he stay behind to help me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three of them looked at Ling Tian with both anger and laughter, \u201cYou are really too greedy. Isn\u2019t it enough for him to give you the world? Should he stay behind to help you as well? Don\u2019t you know that Beyond Heavens isn\u2019t permitted to enter the conflicts of the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian grunted in his heart and grumbled, Then why are you guys still talking so much? However, his face remained calm and he said, \u201cI see, I thought that he only gave me a sword to kill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that you are going to use this sword to\u2026 kill?\u201d the face of the white robed scholar became strange and his tone became high. He eyes narrowed and the veins on his forehead pulsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously!\u201d Ling Tian rolled his eyes, \u201cIf I don\u2019t use it to kill, am I going to use it to chop up vegetables?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone felt like fainting on the spot!</p><br/><p>The white robed scholar went into a daze and jumped in anger as his spittle flew in all directions, \u201cThis is the Heaven Splitter! The ancient Heaven Splitter! You are using it to kill? This this this\u2026 this is preposterous!\u201d</p></div>\n</div>"}

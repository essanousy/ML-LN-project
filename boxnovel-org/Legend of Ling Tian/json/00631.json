She then pounced into her father\u2019s embrace with tears streaming down her cheeks.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang hugged his daughter tightly and was immersed in the feeling of holding his daughter in his embrace.</p><br/><p>A long while later, Yu BingYan finally stopped sobbing and said softly, \u201cDuring this trip to Heavenly Wind, while I do not dare say the same about the others, BingYan will definitely not be in the slightest bit of danger. Father can be at ease.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Oh?\u201d Yu ManTang frowned for a moment before breaking out into a big smile, \u201cDid Ling Tian make an arrangement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Ling Tian? Tian\u2019ge is your son-in-law.\u201d Yu BingYan said shyly.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang laughed heartily, \u201cHaha, that\u2019s right. Did my son-in-law make an arrangement?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, everything is under Tian\u2019ge\u2019s control.\u201d Yu BingYan\u2019s face reddened as she said.</p><br/><p>Everything is under his control? As Yu ManTang heard those words, he could not help but doubt in his heart.</p><br/><p>Since when did Ling Tian have such abilities? Yu ManTang was filled with a tinge of doubt in his heart but after seeing his daughter\u2019s confident appearance, Yu ManTang knew that he should not say anything else. However, he was no longer as worried as before.</p><br/><p>Since Ling Tian had made preparations, BingYan\u2019s life would definitely not be in danger. As for the preparations that Ling Tian had made, it would be the best for him to be kept out of the loop, lest he accidentally divulge it. While Yu ManTang was confident in himself, he knew that he couldn\u2019t match up to his big brother\u2019s scheming and the best way for him to keep a secret would be to remain ignorant.</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan lifted her head up and said, \u201cFather, I hope that you can be a good host to the 500 guards that Ling Tian sent. After allowing them to tour Bright Jade City for a day or two, I will keep a few personal guards back and send the rest back to Sky Bearing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d Yu ManTang chuckled before asking his daughter, \u201cThese 500 guards are all brimming with energy and are definitely talented individuals. The few personal guards that my son-in-law picked out for you should be extremely skilled right? My son-in-law is truly generous!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan\u2019s face turned red and she nodded her head with agreement, \u201cI do not dare hide things from Father and any one of their martial arts would be comparable to Third Uncle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang took in a deep breath of cold air! Every one of them is comparable to Yu ManTian?!</p><br/><p>That meant that there were at least three or four individuals with such strength! Yu ManTian was already nearing the middle Gold Jade Rank. Apart from the few old fellows in the Yu Family, there were less than ten who were capable of winning against Yu ManTian! For a nouveau riche family like the Ling Family, it would be already an amazing feat if Ling Tian was able to send out four peak HouTian experts at once. However, Ling Tian had actually sent out four middle Gold Jade Rank experts at once just for Yu BingYan. It could be seen just how much Ling Tian doted on Yu BingYan!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang felt that the strength of his son-in-law was becoming more and more mysterious. Only at this point could he truly be at ease about Yu BingYan\u2019s safety. At the same time, he was also extremely grateful on behalf of Yu BingYan. Just from how Ling Tian was willing to send out so many experts to guard Yu BingYan, it could be seen how happy her life was in the Ling Family.</p><br/><p>Yu ManTang twiddled with his beard and muttered, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then you should leave a few more of them behind. Apart from your few personal guards, you should leave a few dozen guards behind to pull the wool over everyone\u2019s eyes. Even if they are capable of retracting their aura, it is best to be careful. If the family notices that they are all top-notch experts, it may cause some troubles instead. With your first uncle\u2019s personality, he may come up with a sinister plan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, Father has truly thought things through.\u201d Yu BingYan felt her heart shake and agreed solemnly. She originally only planned to keep Feng, Yun, Lei, and Dian behind, but after her father\u2019s reminder, she realized that her original plan was extremely inappropriate. With her first uncle\u2019s character, if he found out that there were such experts in the Ling Family, he would definitely come up with a plan to exterminate them!</p><br/><p>Under Yu ManTang\u2019s arrangements, Ling Feng and the rest entered the Yu Family in a low-profile manner. After some serious considerations, Yu BingYan kept sixty guards behind and stationed them in the courtyard where she and her father stayed. The guards were split into four groups with Feng, Yun, Lei, and Dian each leading a group. They surrounded Yu BingYan\u2019s room with a water-tight defense.</p><br/><p>The Ling Family was currently enemies with the Yu Family in the Heavenly Star Continent and the presence of the Ling Family guards naturally dissatisfied the Yu Family members. Thus, conflicts between the two groups were inevitable but Ling Feng and the rest chose to endure the humiliation rather than have conflicts with the Yu Family members.</p><br/><p>Such a powerful mental resilience made Yu ManTang gasp with admiration. It was easy to draw the sword but difficult to bear with humiliation! Even after a month, Yu ManTang could not tell who the experts among the group were!</p><br/><p>While the Ling Family guards moved into the Yu Family in an orderly fashion, ever since these guards entered the Yu Family, Bright Jade City was thrown into chaos. Despite it being winter, houses would catch fire all around the city for no good reason and many would complain about thefts in their homes. The whole Yu Family was filled with an extremely dark atmosphere.</p><br/><p>The Yu Family monitored the movements of the sixty guards day and night but was helpless as they realized that these sixty guards were completely stationary when all of these bizarre events occurred. Because of that, they could only helplessly proclaim them as innocent. In this winter, Bright Jade City seemed to have been through a war and the whole city was completely devoid of energy.</p><br/><p>Finally, just when everyone was leading bitter lives, the spring winds began to blow.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the Yu Family became even tenser.</p><br/><p>It was time for them to travel to Heavenly Wind and start the battle!</p><br/><p>******</p><br/><p>Ling Tian ran out from the Ling Family Courtyard as though he was escaping for his life!</p><br/><p>For a full winter, Ling Tian was playing hide and seek with Meng LiGe and the others. Even with Ling Tian\u2019s powerful will and body, he was extremely fatigued.</p><br/><p>They were far too persistent!</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe and the others could not be blamed for the matter either. Ling Tian\u2019s father and grandfather were just too difficult to deal with. Old Master Ling liked to feign ignorance and every time the officials of the imperial court requested him to ascend the throne, he would feign ignorance or pretend that he was unable to hear what they were saying. \u201cWhat did you say? Huh? Speak louder! Wha\u2026.t\u2026 I can\u2019t hear you.\u201d His selective listening was extremely well honed and he would never be able to hear what the officials had to say clearly. If you have the patience, alright, I shall sit here and hear you out. But after a few sentences, Old Master Ling would be tired and falling asleep\u2026</p><br/><p>Helpless, the various officials could only take their leave. The moment the officials took their leave, Old Master Ling would be revived and energetic, pulling his wife to play mahjong with him.</p><br/><p>As for Marshal Ling, he was far more direct. \u201cScram! Whoever dares to bother me shall be served with 80 military planks!\u201d</p><br/><p>Marshal Ling wasn\u2019t completely lying. He had even gone to the extent of bribing his friend to put up a show with him. His friend would first attempt to persuade him and he would then give his friend 40 military planks in public. While everyone could tell that it was a show, they all knew that the next person who attempted to persuade Marshal Ling would definitely not be spared.</p><br/><p>Under such circumstances, they naturally had no choice but to pester Ling Tian. Thus, a rare winter break of young noble Ling Tian was completely ruined by them all. Even if he wanted to find the few beauties for a nice and lovely chat, he would have to ensure that his actions were stealthy and concealed as though he was a secret agent. He was only missing a secret code with his few lovers\u2026</p><br/><p>The spring winds arrived and the letter of the Shui Family arrived together with them. The Shui Family requested that Shui QianRou leave a few people behind to guard the Shui Family Courtyard and send the rest of the Shui Family forces back to Heavenly Wind. However, the Shui Family did not specify a time and only requested that Shui QianRou return before the start of the generational battle.</p><br/><p>To the Shui Family, all of the other participants of the Shui Family were already prepared. As for Shui QianRou fighting the princess of the Yu Family, there wasn\u2019t even a need to make any preparations. Thus, they weren\u2019t anxious in the slightest. Was there even a need to make any preparations when their Shui Family\u2019s number one genius was facing the martial arts trash of the Yu Family? Victory was certain!</p><br/><p>However, while they weren\u2019t anxious, Ling Tian was. Ling Tian already felt as though his days were extremely miserable and anxiously pestered Shui QianRou to leave as early as possible.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Shui QianRou was also extremely nervous about matters in Heavenly Wind, so they swiftly tied up all the necessary loose ends and immediately set off for Heavenly Wind.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian brought Ling Jian along with him and the both of them mysteriously disappeared from the Ling Family Courtyard a few days before Shui QianRou set off. As for the various large and small matters of the Courtyard, he naturally dumped them all to Meng LiGe, Ling Chen, and Li Xue.</p><br/><p>This incident made Ling Chen, Li Xue, and Xiao YanXue blow up in a huge rage. After his pleading was completely useless in the face of the three ladies anger, the three ladies joined hands to give Ling Tian a good beating.</p><br/><p>The person who was the happiest was Die\u2019er. Shui QianRou left her behind in Heavenly Star so that she could be with her loved one, Ling Chi. This made the originally depressed Ling Chi feel a little better.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had an inexplicable feeling in his heart at this moment. Ever since he received the two pieces of Heaven\u2019s Heart Jade and the mysterious phenomena it had together with the Heaven Splitter, a huge puzzle filled up Ling Tian\u2019s mind. Ling Tian was certain that there was a heaven shaking secret hidden within this puzzle and the source of this secret was in Heavenly Wind! Right at Mount Vacant!</p><br/><p>Apart from the various plans that Ling Tian had on this trip, he also intended to solve this puzzle. At the same time, Ling Tian had a strange feeling in his heart. He was almost certain that he would definitely not return empty-handed from his trip to Heavenly Wind.</p><br/><p>After the members of the Shui Family left, Meng LiGe and the rest found out that Ling Tian had also disappeared and angrily stomped his way to find Ling Chen to lodge a complaint. Upon arrival, he received a letter from Ling Chen which was written by Ling Tian to persuade Old Master Ling to ascend the throne.</p><br/><p>Meng LiGe then took this letter to find Old Master Ling but was reprimanded by Old Master Ling. Returning back to the Courtyard dejected, Meng LiGe let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was already by the sea and upon peering into the vast ocean, the words that appeared during the combination of the two jade pieces surfaced in his heart: Vacant in the East, Heaven and Earth Essence, Sharpness of Heaven Splitter, It Can Be Fought!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian muttered those words in his heart as he fell into a daze with the Heaven Splitter hanging on his waist.</p></div>\n</div>"}

No one could easily brush off an extreme killing technique such as Sword and Body as One. Let alone Lei ZhenTian, not even Justice would dare to look down on the skill!</p><br/><p>Even if Lei ZhenTian had already increased his strength by five times, he still had to admit the ferocity of such a technique. If he were to forcibly receive it, then even he would turn into a pile of minced meat! However, the moment he chose to retaliate, it could only end in mutual destruction!</p><br/><p>While this could allow Ling Tian to escape danger, this sort of price was something he could not accept! This was because the price of doing so involved the lives of Ling Jian and Li Xue!</p><br/><p>Be it Ling Jian or Li Xue, Ling Tian could not allow them to suffer such misfortune!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was originally speeding along at a high speed, running dizzily in circles around Lei ZhenTian, but at this moment he let out a light shout, and the countless afterimages integrated into one whole at this instant. The divine weapon, Heaven Splitter, also let out countless rays of sword light from within itself, shooting straight towards Lei ZhenTian. These countless sword lights gradually converged to form a piercingly huge beam of light, like countless tributaries converging into the great ocean. From afar, it looked as though the heavens and earth had converged to form a gigantic sword, piercing straight forward!</p><br/><p>This was also the similar skill of Sword and Body as One! But Ling Tian actually did not store up any power before combining the scattered sword lights together as one, employing and completing his skill in one assault! This even gave Justice who was watching by the side a scare!</p><br/><p>From the ancient times till now, this was still the first time he had heard of Sword and Body as One being executed this way. Even Justice himself had no confidence in executing this sort of move!</p><br/><p>The three strongest experts of the Ling Family triangulated their target as they executed their most penetrative attack. All of them were actually proficient in the ultimate killing move of Sword and Body as One!</p><br/><p>In the air, one could only see the three resplendent glows of sword light, the bodies of the three experts already being integrated into the light itself! No one could tell that there was actually a human residing within these sword lights!</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian let out an agonized scream as though he was a beast approaching death, and his entire body suddenly started exuding black strands of energy. A gale mysteriously started to blow around him, circling him with rustling sounds as it grew more and more urgent with every passing second. In a few moments, it had turned into a violent eddy. The black energy strands clumped together in the eddy, and it looked as though the Ling Family Courtyard had given birth to a black hole! The surrounding space started to warp and tear with sizzling sounds, causing the entire atmosphere to take on a devilish look.</p><br/><p>Three undaunting swords, carrying similar undaunting people simultaneously collided with the black whirlwind!</p><br/><p>The howl of Lei ZhenTian reached a crescendo at this very moment!</p><br/><p>With the sound of a volcano erupting, a huge crater was forcibly carved out in the surface of the Ling Family Courtyard, with a circumference in excess of sixty feet. A mushroom cloud of dust rose up and enveloped the whole area, while the armies of the two families all around the impact were knocked out like dominoes, with a few even bleeding from their ears due to the sound!</p><br/><p>Those who were nearer to the source had it even worse. Not a single one of them were without injuries, and some even had holes piercing through their bodies\u2026</p><br/><p>This was the final attack from Lei ZhenTian. It contained all the essence of his muscular strength, bursting out ferociously in this one attack. If this were to impact a person\u2019s body, it would be akin to being hit by an acruballista, without a single chance for them to escape!</p><br/><p>If those surrounding the source of impact could be injured to such an extent, then what would be the extent of those three who bore the brunt of the impact?</p><br/><p>When the dust settled, three silhouettes shakily stood up. They were precisely the experts from the Ling Family Courtyard! Ling Tian himself only had a few strips of clothing remaining, his entire body painted red with his blood. While he was the last to make a move, his movements were the quickest, and the distance between him and Lei ZhenTian was the shortest. Furthermore, with him being the main target of Lei ZhenTian\u2019s revenge, he had to bear more than half of Lei ZhenTian\u2019s assault! While the injuries were insufficient to claim his life, he was inflicted with severe internal injuries, with his internal organs all having shifted\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Jian tottered up fifty feet away, a pale expression on his face, and his eyes devoid of spirit, as though he would be blown back down by a gust of wind\u2026</p><br/><p>Li Xue held on to her sword, stubbornly standing up, the corners of her mouth leaking out blood continuously\u2026</p><br/><p>As for Lei ZhenTian in the center, he had long disappeared, his body of flesh and blood,\u2026 even his bones could not be seen!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian breathed out a long breath as he rolled his eyes and thought, \u201cWhat a perverse fellow! Three people taking action together, even Justice would have to dodge it. This guy actually ignored everything and used self-detonation, all to inflict serious injuries on us!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian actually didn\u2019t know that it was Lei ZhenTian being too greedy. At the final moment, he wanted to drag all three of them down to the grave with him! This assault by Ling Tian and the others could be said to have been flawlessly coordinated. They did not even discuss it beforehand and were not in the same area at all. They even attacked with different timings, but the teamwork forged long ago allowed Ling Tian to pay attention to their attack and arrange himself in such a manner.</p><br/><p>This seamless attack could have been said to allow the three of them to reach Lei ZhenTian at the exact same time, reaching the lethal zone of Lei ZhenTian! This made him confident that if he were to go all out, he would be able to kill the three of them in one go! As such, he activated his Unlimited Will of Heaven the moment the swords pierced into him!</p><br/><p>If he wasn\u2019t so greedy and only aimed to pull Ling Tian down with him or at most two of them, then with his current strength, other than Ling Tian, Li Xue and Ling Jian could not possibly endure even half of his full strength! If he chose to ignore Ling Jian and Li Xue, only choosing to wholeheartedly deal with Ling Tian, then he could ensure that even if the latter did not die, he would likely be crippled for life!</p><br/><p>But because of his greed, and because of his overconfidence, the three of them luckily survived. After all, even with an increase of fivefold in strength, three experts were still not something Lei ZhenTian could take head-on!</p><br/><p>Naturally, the nuances within could only be seen by Justice, and even he sighed in praise at their good luck.</p><br/><p>Lei ZhenTian was undoubtedly a smart, scheming, and cautious person, neither overconfident nor arrogant. From all sides, he could be considered a great opponent of Ling Tian\u2019s, with a difficulty not below that of Yu ManLou!</p><br/><p>But, he was lacking on something compared to Ling Tian: Luck! Originally, his luck could be considered pretty good, as he chose the moment when the Ling Family Courtyard was at its weakest to assault it, a rare opportunity. However, Justice had unexpectedly appeared, resulting in the despairing conditions of the Ling Family taking a turn for the better. While Justice\u2019s strength was not enough for him to deal with everyone even if he were to have another breakthrough, the subsequent delay allowed for Ling Tian and the others to rush back! Without the interference from Justice, even if Ling Tian and the rest had managed to rush back to the courtyard, the situation would likely already be too late to salvage. From this, it could be concluded that Ling Tian could be said to possess heaven-defying luck, while Lei ZhenTian did not!</p><br/><p>As such, Lei ZhenTian died!</p><br/><p>Since Lei ZhenTian perished, the seven elders would not be so lucky as to survive. The three great deacons had lost their lives earlier, and now that the other inner court experts had been cleared off by Ling Jian and Li Xue, the stragglers were not worth talking about. Right now, their emotions were in disarray. After being surrounded and repeatedly slaughtered by the Ling Family\u2019s reinforcements, the remaining 300 finally could not hold out any longer and dropped their weapons to surrender.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian did not even blink an eye, sending down the order that they were not taking any prisoners of war, and to kill to the last man!</p><br/><p>With this, the greatest danger the Ling Family Courtyard had ever faced finally settled down peacefully.</p><br/><p>In this war, the biggest casualties were without a doubt Ling Feng, Yun, Chi, and Feng Mo. All four of them were covered in wounds, with Ling Feng and Ling Yun not even having a complete patch of skin on their bodies. If Justice did not make a move to help them staunch their bleeding, they would have already kicked the bucket! Ling Tian also conveniently handed over the whole bunch of injured people for Justice to take care of. After all, having such a medical saint present here, to not utilize him would be an absolute waste of resources. Justice could hardly contain his anger!</p><br/><p>Knowing this, Ling Tian did not even try to talk to Justice, only inviting him to the medical warehouse, telling him to use as he deemed fit, before quickly disappearing in a whirlwind to treat his own injuries\u2026</p><br/><p>This move caused the number one expert to even be unable to endure any longer, scolding and cursing towards Ling Tian without a single care for his bearings. How difficult was it to actually get Justice to act on one\u2019s behalf? It had always been the case of \u2018one token in exchange for one life\u2019, and even the respected monarch of a country was insignificant in Justice\u2019s eyes. Right now, not only did the Ling Family not possess a Martial Order Medallion, but Justice was practically doing this as a form of community service, with no recompense whatsoever\u2026</p><br/><p>He himself had come to look for Ling Tian to settle scores, but ended up saving his wife, his subordinates, and protecting his foundations instead! This was already bad enough, but now he even had to become their family physician?!</p><br/><p>Justice\u2019s heart was naturally immensely unsatisfied. That little brat Ling Tian! What does he take this seat for? How repulsive! If you want to do it this way, then I can naturally continue to play along with you. Just you wait and see! This medical warehouse is really nicely stocked, with quite a few rare and precious herbs even categorized properly. Not bad, really not bad!</p><br/><p>After this matter, all those in the know understood that all the injured under Ling Tian\u2019s command were fully healed, without even the slightest sequelae, and even not suffering any drop in cultivation level. However, any moment they heard a phrase similar to Justice, then they would immediately stiffen up and lose all feeling in their hands and legs. Even the generous Ling Tian, after checking his fully stocked warehouse, wanted to cry yet no tears could come out. He could only scream out the injustice in his heart. Meanwhile, the moment the miserly Xiao YanXue found out about this matter, she immediately pointed her finger at his nose and gave him a good scolding. This was really the case of if one is not in someone else\u2019s situation one cannot understand that person\u2019s troubles. How could Ling Tian let an outsider into his own personal storage? Stupid!</p><br/><p>However, all this would be in the future. Ling Tian naturally did not think of all this at the current moment. Right now, he had already brought Ling Jian, Ling Chen, Li Xue, Yu BingYan, and Lei, Dian, as well as Ling Six into the secret chamber, going into closed-door cultivation to treat his injuries\u2026</p></div>\n</div>"}

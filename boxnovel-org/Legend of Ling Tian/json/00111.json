From the sixth layer on, stepping into the next level was as difficult as ascending to the heavens! Ling Tian understood the principle of \u2018more haste, less speed\u2019. If he wanted to forcefully advance, not only would his cultivation not take a step forward, it would create a large burden, or even damage, for his body! Only by maintaining a calm and carefree attitude would his cultivation improve. No matter how small the improvement was, it was still an improvement.</p><br/><p>After Yu BingYan came, she had destroyed Ling Tian\u2019s optimal mental state. The earlier Yu BingYan\u2019s Divine Black Negative Meridians was treated, the higher the probability of success. While Ling Tian was able to wait, Yu BingYan could not. Even if he is able to refine the Great Cyclic Pill, it was only a method to stall for time.</p><br/><p>Tonight, Yu BingYan did not return to the Wei family but stayed in the Ling family instead, moving in with her guards. This made the originally spacious courtyard become a little squeezy. At the same time, Ling Tian\u2019s actions also became more restricted. Because the Wei family was worried about Yu BingYan, they sent Wei XuanXuan to invite her back. However, with the reason of Ling Tian being injured, Yu BingYan insisted on staying there.</p><br/><p>Helpless, Wei XuanXuan could only agree to pick Yu BingYan up at noon the next day.</p><br/><p>The sky was already dark.</p><br/><p>A soft snapping sound could be heard on the roof.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was awoken from his meditative state, opening his eyes slowly. His eyes fixed onto the person on the roof as his divine sense spread out. If this person had any malicious intentions, Ling Tian would kill the person with all he had!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, it is me.\u201d Feeling Ling Tian\u2019s sharp killing intent, the person on the roof quickly spoke: he was Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>From the opened window, Ling Jian drifted in, \u201cYoung noble, what\u2019s the matter? Why do I feel two unfamiliar experts in the house apart from young noble? Furthermore, they are both extremely alert. What is going on? Afraid that I will reveal myself, I jumped straight onto young noble\u2019s roof from the outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian praised, \u201cLing Jian, you are indeed more mature in recent times. You are now able to make flexible decisions when you realize that something is wrong. Haha, if it were a few years back, you would have probably walked in foolishly from the front door, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian rubbed his heads embarrassedly. His chilly face was like an immature child in front of Ling Tian, \u201cYoung noble praised me too much. The situation today was just too odd; this is the first time our house is on such high alert! If not for this subordinate knowing young noble\u2019s ability, I would have definitely thought that something happened within the family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe little princess of the Yu family is in our house.\u201d Ling Tian said calmly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, no wonder.\u201d Ling Jian\u2019s eyes was suddenly burning with passion, \u201cAre those two experts the guards of the little princess? Young noble, I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian interrupted him, \u201cNo way! You cannot touch them now. They are both not your opponents. Once drawn, your swordplay cannot be retracted, resolute with killing intent. It is the sharpest and most powerful swordplay in the world today. While they are not your opponents, you will have to fight them with all of your might if they join hands to fight you. In the exchange between experts, life and death happens in an instant and the both of them will definitely die under your hands. However, the little princess of the Yu family is an extremely important affair and nothing must happen. The moment something goes wrong, we will be on the defensive end.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian went silent for a moment before saying, \u201cI will wait! There will definitely be such a day!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian giggled, \u201cLing Jian, when this day really comes, you will realize that you are no longer interested in the both of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cYoung noble, are we going to have special training again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed, \u201cThat\u2019s not the case. It is just that I thought of another situation from your killing intent just now. Ling Jian, do you know that you no longer require any special training anymore? Special training can only improve the endurance, reflexes and agility of a person. It is already useless to you. The thing which you have to increase now is your cultivation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian seemed a little disappointed as he heard that, frustrated over the fact that special training will no longer be of use to him. Ling Jian knew just how cruel Ling Tian\u2019s special training was. It is able to make an expert like himself live under the pressure of death every moment, afraid to even relax for a moment. While such a feeling was torture to an ordinary person, it was a rare experience for someone like Ling Jian who lived on the borders of life and death every day!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, you said that you thought of another situation from my killing intent? What kind of situation did you think about?\u201d Ling Jian asked.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s eyes flashed, \u201cThe situation when you fight the both of them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was stunned for a moment, \u201cDidn\u2019t young noble say that I will be able to win the both of them, even if they joined hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile you are able to win the both of them, do you know what kind of a price you will pay?\u201d Ling Tian asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo serve the young noble, death is nothing. Ling Jian\u2019s life already belongs to the young noble!\u201d Ling Jian replied without thinking.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian shook his head, \u201cYou are wrong. The both of them are top notch experts. With your ability, you will be able to win the both of them. However, you will have to pay a huge price which may be\u2026\u201d As Ling Tian said that, he was stunned for a moment. You have to know; Ling Tian was betrayed by his own family in his past life and humiliated by his blood brothers. He no longer had the feeling of brotherhood in his heart any longer. While Ling Jian was loyal to him, it was due to the favor which he owed Ling Tian and the effects of brainwashing. However, he had actually mention those words of concern without thinking. Did he really treat Ling Jian as a true brother and not a chess piece which could be sacrificed at any time?</p><br/><p>The both of them did not speak for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the matter settled?\u201d Ling Tian was the first to regain his calmness and asked. While this was a question, it seemed more like a confirmation. Ling Tian would never doubt Ling Jian\u2019s ability and Ling Jian had never disappointed Ling Tian. Furthermore, sending Ling Jian to deal with NanGong Le was akin to using a cannon to kill a chicken. It would be even more surprising if Ling Jian did not succeed.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian chuckled before replying, \u201cNanGong Le\u2019s head had been thrown into the river by me. Young noble, I am not sure about something and I hope you can enlighten me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian opened his eyes and looked at Ling Jian, signalling for Ling Jian to continue.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strength of the NanGong family seemed a little too weak. None of the NanGong family\u2019s guards were able to even block my sword. Don\u2019t young noble think that there is something wrong?\u201d Ling Jian asked with doubt plastered all over his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe NanGong family is not the Yu family or \u2018Water of Heavenly Wind\u2019 after all. It is understandable for them to be slightly weaker. Not every family is able to have a large number of experts. However, the NanGong family definitely has experts; this fact is undeniable! As for why the guards of NanGong Le is so weak, this goes to show that a silkpants like him is not important in the family.\u201d Ling Tian said in a deep tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Ling Jian nodded his head, \u201cyoung noble, since the matter is settled, I will return to the Ling Family Courtyard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled and said with a gentle tone, \u201cThere\u2019s no rush, ah Jian, apart from when we were young and a few other night conversations, we rarely have any chance to interact. Especially after you exterminated the Blood Rose Hall and moved to the Ling Family Courtyard, you have been on the move for long periods of time, without a shelter over your head as you toiled away for long hours. It has been tough on you. Tonight, let us brothers have a gathering. You can also tell me about all the things which have happened in the past few years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s eyes reddened as he felt the deep sense of concern from Ling Tian, \u201cYoung noble is more knowledgeable than anyone in the world, with wisdom far exceeding his peers. Furthermore, Ling Jian owes the young noble a great favor and even death would repay only a mere fragment of it. How would I dare to be brothers with the young noble. I\u2026 am alright; no matter what I have to do for the young noble, I am willing to do so! I will always be young noble\u2019s sword!\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s ThoughtsDavidT DavidT</p><br/><p>Second bonus chapter of the week~~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

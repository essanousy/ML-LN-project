But you guys cannot even separate good from bad, and berate her as such! Where is your conscience? Are you people still human?!\u201d Die\u2019er felt her entire body tremble from rage, pointing at Shui QianGang and the rest. Her eyes were already bloodshot with anger as she spewed nonstop.</p><br/><p>\u201cAudacious! This is an internal family meeting, and the decisions are made by the family members! Just who do you think you are! A mere servant girl dares to raise her voice here, does this place have room for you to talk? Come, men, drag her out and beat her to death!\u201d Shui QianHu scolded in agitation. Never in his dreams would he think that a mere servant girl would have the audacity to point at his nose and scold him, was she tired of living?!</p><br/><p>\u2018Who dares?!\u201d Shui QianRou stepped forward at this time, protecting Die\u2019er as she raised her own voice, \u201cShe\u2019s my maid, since when was it your turn to lecture her? Shui QianHu, what you do you think you are?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m nothing at all, but still better than that babbling slut over there! Just based on how your subordinates dare to be so unbridled, there\u2019s nothing much that can be said for you as well. Why, do you think you\u2019re qualified to lecture me?\u201d Shui QianHu snarled, slapping the table as he stood up!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re right, you\u2019re nothing at all actually. Just based on what you have, how would I even bother to deal with you? If you really wish to seek death, then this lady here will grant you your wish! If you want to touch my maid, just you Shui QianHu, you\u2019re not worthy!\u201d Shui QianRou did not give in at all, a fire blazing in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Shui QianHu laughed out maliciously, \u201cYou think I\u2019m scared? Bring it on! We\u2019ll compare our moves!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them drew their swords from their sheath and moved out towards the courtyard.</p><br/><p>A fight with their lives on the line!</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumptuous! Are all of you rebelling?!\u201d The First Elder slapped the table in anger. \u201cCreating such a fuss, whatever is next?! Do you guys still place this old man in your eyes?!\u201d</p><br/><p>With this shout, both fighters stopped completely but still continued to stare daggers at each other, just like cocks fighting for dominance.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Shui QianHuan was mediocre and incompetent, causing our hidden forces of over a decade to be completely uprooted by our millennium-long enemies. He himself even barely survived by a fluke. To think that this trash of a sister is even better, to curry favor to her love, she even sold out the entire Shui Family! You brother and sister pair are really geniuses!\u201d On one side, Shui QianJiang spoke with a weird tone, attempting to fan the flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll shut your mouths for this old man!\u201d The First Elder yelled once again. \u201cDid we travel over a thousand miles to here just to hear you guys quarrel?! Bickering like children, how scandalous, how are you people showing to others the bearing of an aristocrat?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I would like to seek advice from First Elder. Since your honorable self mentioned that you have traveled a long distance to reach here, then if I may be so bold, what is the purpose of all of you traveling across the oceans to here? You do not wish to go against the Yu Family, and yet also do not wish to work with the Ling Family. As such, what is the purpose of you people coming over to Heavenly Star? Why come to Sky Bearing?\u201d Shui QianRou almost wanted to cry out in anger, but she held back her tears, forcing out the words.</p><br/><p>The First Elder indifferently glanced at Shui QianRou, snorting before he spoke, \u201cWe\u2019ll definitely go against the Yu Family in time, and as for working with the Ling Family, I cannot just take it based on your words. The matter is too serious, and I have to personally meet with the people in command of the Ling Family. We will have to revise the collaboration. Just based on the previous method you\u2019ve detailed, our Shui Family will never be able to accept such a humiliating cooperation, without benefits!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s heart turned cold at this moment, and she despairingly replied, \u201cFirst Elder\u2019s words mean that you do not believe in QianRou anymore? The family is rejecting my proposal now?\u201d</p><br/><p>A callous reply greeted her, \u201cThis old man did not mean it that way, but now that I\u2019m responsible for all the manpower in Sky Bearing, and also the one in command, I have to ensure the safety of our people as well as their benefits. I cannot let them sacrifice themselves blindly, as a dowry for others!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianHai shouted out joyously, \u201cFirst Elder is indeed a person of virtue and moral standing, treating everyone partially. What a good \u2018not willing to sacrifice themselves as dowry for others\u2019, this is really apt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehehe\u2026\u201d Shui QianRou was already angered to the extreme, but instead started laughing, coldly replying, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then I\u2019ll inform the Ling Family Courtyard and tell them that for the cooperation between us, my brother and I are completely pulling out. From today onwards, this brother and sister will wash our hands of any matters! And we\u2019ll immediately return back to the Heavenly Wind Continent, never to come to Heavenly Star again!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d Shui QianJiang rejected flatly, \u201cWho would know whether you have anyone hidden among us already? You can choose not to talk or express your opinions, but you and Shui QianHuan are not allowed to leave! The majority of us came because of your so-called proposal, so at this moment, you want to absolve yourself of all your problems by leaving? How can it be so simple?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot just that, for the cooperation previously, it was between you and the Ling Family Courtyard. However, now that we\u2019re here, we want to work with the entire Ling Family, and not just some Ling Family Courtyard! Don\u2019t think that any Tom, Dick, or Harry has the qualifications to work with us just because they want to. The small Courtyard doesn\u2019t have that ability! Even the Ling Family can only serve as our subordinates, and for them to do so is already a great honor!\u201d Shui QianHai hooted.</p><br/><p>\u201cUp to you guys then, whatever the case, I\u2019ll wash my hands of it.\u201d Shui QianRou stood up, weary in body and soul. She looked at them in despair as she turned to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop! Where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Shui QianHu stretched out an arm, ready to obstruct her.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou immediately lashed out, \u201cI wish to return to my room to rest, do I need your permission? Are you going to bind me up in chains? Shui QianHu, get the f**k off!\u201d Shui QianRou had already reached her limits, and boundless pressure was released from her body. She could no longer control her temper, and if Shui QianHu spoke yet another word, she would not hesitate to cripple this idiot where he stood!</p><br/><p>Feeling her immense strength, everyone present stared at her with some astonishment. Shui QianJiang smirked and replied, \u201cSo long as Sister Rou does not run around, then how would we dare to track you? QianHu, let her go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianHu consented and moved aside. Shui QianRou only coldly snorted at them, before leaving with her head held high. Behind her, the rest exchanged glances in delight, as though celebrating their success in this first battle.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou rushed towards her brother\u2019s room in a temper. At the entrance, a grave and stern youth in black smiled as he watched her come over, and remarked, \u201cThe Shui Family is really enthusiastic.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was none other than Ling Chi!</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou, however, ignored him and went straight inside, while Die\u2019er glared at Ling Chi, nastily replying, \u201cWatched a good show right? If it wasn\u2019t for your good young noble, how would our Miss suffer such injustice?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chi was taken aback, and could only awkwardly laugh to cover up, \u201cI didn\u2019t watch, I merely listened, and it was quite the good show. Wait, what has this got to do with my young noble? Watch where you bite!\u201d Suddenly a yelp was heard, as that little lass suddenly launched herself towards Ling Chi in anger, taking a good bite out of Ling Chi\u2019s arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, I only said that in passing, must you really bite! Are you a dog?!\u201d Ling Chi exasperatedly shook her off and saw a row of obvious bite marks on his arm. The pain made him take a cold breath, and seeing Die\u2019er delightedly walk into the room, Ling Chi made up his mind to go report to his Sister Chen when he returned, to deploy another here\u2026 he had enough!</p><br/><p>From the room came the suppressed sobbing of Shui QianRou. Strong-willed she might be, she was still a lady, and to suddenly have all the suspicion and distrust of her family on her, doubting her blood and sweat, it was all too heavy for her. As such, the moment she saw the face of her brother, she could take it no longer, and poured it all out.</p><br/><p>Shui QianHuan coughed in agitation, planning to push his body to seek revenge on those who humiliated his sister. He was already seriously injured, and with the invasion of bacteria along with the constant jeering and humiliation he received, even with the meticulous care from a doctor, his body was deteriorating. Today, under his anger, he nearly couldn\u2019t catch his breath and coughed repeatedly for quite a while. Most likely, he was going to cough out blood again.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou lost her composure at the scene, ignoring her own sadness to comfort her brother. She constantly soothed his chest, and it was only after a long while did he finally show signs of calming down. She did not dare to talk about her own grievances any longer, choosing the time when she was alone to shed tears silently. She grieved that while the world was wide, with so many people around her, there was actually no one to lend her a shoulder.</p><br/><p>Upon thinking about Ling Tian, that sweetheart yet destined foe, she felt even more of a heartache. While she liked him very much, how could she deal with him not having any feelings towards her? Oh heavens! What should she do?!</p><br/><p>On the second day, Shui QianHu and the rest swaggered over to the Ling Family in Sky Bearing, wanting to look for Old Master Ling Zhan to negotiate about collaboration and to the point of making the Ling Family their subordinate family. In their thoughts, Old Master Ling should have fallen to the ground in gratitude, bowing deeply to welcome them!</p><br/><p>However, things did not go according to their wishes. Not only did they not manage to see the Old Master, they had to talk to the Old Madam who greeted them with a cold expression the whole time. She only clearly spoke one sentence: that the current Ling Family had handed all the authority over to Ling Tian and Ling Family Courtyard. The Ling Residence within the capital was just a place for them to live their remaining days in peace and quiet. After finished her piece, the Old Madam did not even wait for them to talk but sent them off immediately.</p><br/><p>Seeing the look of the Ling Family residence, they also understood that the base of operations was now in the Ling Family Courtyard. Thus they could only slink out in defeat. They actually thought of looking for Grand Marshall Ling Xiao, but they were only told that Ling Xiao had gone on a military campaign instead.</p><br/><p>This was a situation where when the house has a leaky roof, there would definitely be a torrential downpour! The dejected group actually met a group of Yu Family warriors on their way back, and both sides fought with injuries and deaths. Even Shui QianHu had been slashed once on his arm with a sword, almost turning him into a cripple. It was only by a fluke he managed to escape. When they returned to report, the elders then realized that Shui QianRou\u2019s statement might not be false at all, and could only then send an invite over to the Ling Family Courtyard, requesting for the commander to talk terms with them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

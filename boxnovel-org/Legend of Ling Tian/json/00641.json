Is the Song Family so easily annihilated? And is my HuangFu family so easy to order around?</em></p><br/><p><em>Lunatic ravings!</em></p><br/><p>As everyone\u2019s gazes slowly drifted to the white cloth bundle on the table, their faces revealed anger, as well as some trepidation. All of them were people who had some experience in the real world. While the white cloth perfectly wrapped the contents, there was a hint of a bloody stench wafting from within. How could it be hidden from the senses of those present?</p><br/><p>Could it be?!</p><br/><p>Staring at the white cloth bundle, HuangFu YanHan grit his teeth before commanding, \u201cOpen it up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The white cloth was unraveled layer by layer, and the stench grew stronger. Finally, with a flourish, the last layer was peeled off, and the contents were revealed to be a pale arm. There was even a ring on one of its slender fingers!</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan yelled out wildly, even as his body began to tremble. \u201cJun\u2019er!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>That white jade ring was a rare and precious object. Other than its immense price tag, it was also something that HuangFu YanHan had personally given his second son for his sixteenth birthday! With the presence of this ring, the owner was the arm was without question!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho did it?! Who was the one?!!\u201d HuangFu YanHan was like a deranged lion, as he screamed his fury towards the heavens. \u201cI, HuangFu YanHan, swear to the heavens, that no matter who you are, I\u2019ll shatter your corpse to pieces! I vow to take this revenge of blood!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head, it seems like the other party is not kidding at all about the contents of their letter\u2026.\u201d An elder with a goatee, as well as two long hanging brows worriedly spoke, \u201cRight now, the three young nobles and the Madam are in their hands, and their lives are hanging by a thread. If we do not acquiesce to their demands, then the consequences\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of HuangFu YanHan\u2019s eyes twitched, and he sighed as he replied, \u201cHow could I not be aware? Even if we could gather all our strength and finally manage to annihilate the Song Family, what could we do if they do not wish to let them go? Furthermore, we would be a dying lamp by then, with huge injuries to our vitality. How could we still be able to deal with this mysterious organization with our strength then? If the opponent chose to strike us at that time, then how are we to react? This person has the ability to hatch such a venomous plan, so how could he let us go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Another old man over forty years old said, \u201cFamily Head, maybe the party has some grudge with the Song family, and he is unable to achieve his objectives with his current strength, thus he wishes to borrow our strength to take his revenge!\u201d.</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan laughed bitterly, even as his brows furrowed together. \u201cThis might be possible, but if the party has the ability to make my HuangFu family members soundlessly disappear, then their skills would be far above ordinary people. The person has to be a peerless expert! If that was the case, then how could he have his hands tied regarding the Song Family? While he could be a recluse, unable to handle the entire Song Family, killing them off one by one would be an easy matter! Furthermore, since he has the power to steal my HuangFu family\u2019s people, then he could easily do the same to Song TianQiao\u2019s people. In the end, wouldn\u2019t it be better than having us make a move?! And it would save him so much more strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs such, this person definitely doesn\u2019t have a grudge with the Song Family, and neither does he have a grudge with us! This person is simply being two-faced!\u201d HuangFu YanHan barked out coldly, \u201cThis sort of strategy to use a stone and kill two birds, how dare they have the guts to use it on me?! Furthermore, they\u2019re not afraid of the disdain of others! Why don\u2019t you all think about it for a bit? That day when the Song Family was in an uproar, most likely it was because they also had people who were kidnapped!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head really has a unique view!\u201d the elder with a white goatee hurriedly said. \u201cHowever, if we do not deploy our troops, then how do we deal with the matter of the three young nobles as well as the Madam? That group has such vicious methods, if second young noble\u2019s arm can be delivered today, I\u2019m afraid in the future\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan also frowned in anxiety, pacing around repeatedly. How could he not understand the meaning within the elder\u2019s words? But he had no countermeasure against this situation, only a feeling of an increasing sense of urgency within his heart. He definitely could not adhere to the instructions of the other party, but if he did not listen, then his sons and wife would vanish from the face of this world! Since the other party was decisive enough to chop off his son\u2019s arm, that meant they had the courage to see things through. If he did not follow their instructions, then none of his sons would live on! In that manner, the HuangFu Family would also be finished!</p><br/><p>This was really being trapped in between a rock and a hard spot!</p><br/><p>Even after pondering for a whole day, HuangFu YanHan could not come out with a good idea. He could not help but sigh out loudly, at his wit\u2019s end!</p><br/><p>A scholarly-dressed man was deep in thought as he spoke out, \u201cFamily Head, you mentioned that the Song Family also had some great movements today, and I heard that the two young nobles of the Song Family have also mysteriously disappeared! Along with them was the ninth concubine which was the most favored of Song TianQiao, along with an illegitimate son. The time that they vanished was almost simultaneous, also yesterday night. Could these two matters be linked?\u201d</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan\u2019s eyes lit up, as he started to consider the scenario. It was only after a long time that he finally sighed at the heavens, \u201cThis matter should be orchestrated by the same group of people. Their objective is probably for us to fight among each other, while they sit by the side and play fisherman, waiting to collect the benefits. If my assumptions are correct, I\u2019m afraid Song TianQiao would have also received a similar package to ours. The conditions would be to destroy our HuangFu family! If that\u2019s the case, then the battle between our two houses can\u2019t be avoided any longer. What an effective method, to swoop in when two tigers fight to annihilate both households!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone sucked in a breath of cold air. \u201cWho would be so bold as to offend both our families in one go? Could it be that they aren\u2019t afraid of bringing disaster upon themselves?!\u201d</p><br/><p>After taking in a deep breath, HuangFu YanHan\u2019s face was unnaturally solemn as he revealed an expression of unwillingness and fury, as he snarled, \u201cSong Kuang offended Tian ZhiYi this afternoon in Jade River City, and subsequently disappeared soon after. With all these matters happening in a row after that incident, I can predict that this must have been done by the Sky Alliance!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Sky Alliance!\u201d everyone gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cFive years ago, this Sky Alliance suddenly appeared as though it had dropped down from the sky. Not even a year\u2019s worth of time has passed, but they seem to be akin to spring bamboo shoots after a downpour, with their influence inching upwards day after day. Furthermore, they even tried all sorts of ways to get into a good relationship with the Shui Family. I\u2019m not sure if Shui ManKong had his brains fried in lard, but he actually agreed! With the Shui Family backing them, we could not shoot at the rat for fear of breaking the vases. Three years later, the power of the Sky Alliance was akin to a tsunami, enveloping the entire continent, to the point that even the Shui Family could not do anything to them any longer. From then on, the Sky Alliance officially cut the relationship between them and the Shui Family, all the while growing bigger. After developing to this point, they\u2019re now the biggest blight on this continent!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhile the influence of the Sky Alliance is huge, they do not run any specific businesses. They are only relying on looting to survive, so how can they maintain such huge expenditures? Clothes, weapons, armor\u2026 where did all these things come from? Even now, no one knows. It was only that day when they revealed their fangs that we had a vague idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did Family Head find?\u201d Everyone chorused.</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan ruthlessly snorted before saying, \u201cAs everyone knows, in another month or so there will be the generational battle between the Shui and Yu Families. The last battle sixty years ago was held in Heavenly Star, and this time, it will naturally be hosted on the Heavenly Wind continent! The Yu Family will definitely be coming over in a few days, and for the Sky Alliance to suddenly attempt such a thing without concealing themselves, is that not obvious enough?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily head, your meaning is\u2026 the Sky Alliance belongs to the Yu Family?\u201d Everyone was struck dumb by this revelation.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if they do not belong to the Yu Family, they should have received some instructions from them.\u201d HuangFu YanHan had on a frosty expression, \u201cThe head of Yu Family, Yu ManLou, is a dragon among men, with deep plans and distant thought. He would have long had the thought to vie for supremacy. If this plan was put down five to six years ago, I wouldn\u2019t even be surprised. Indeed, only the Yu Family would have the resources needed for world domination, and only they would be able to allow the Sky Alliance to continuously expand without worrying about resources. If they are able to fully throw the Heavenly Wind continent into chaos this time around, this would be a checkmate from their side. The moment our two families turn chaotic, then wouldn\u2019t the Shui Family also suffer? This would be the best time for the Yu Family to reap the benefits!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamily Head has profound sight. If we follow this method to its logical conclusion, it is indeed so.\u201d Everyone thought about his words and realized the more they pondered, the more it made sense. Everyone was left in awe with the family head\u2019s acute foresight. Right now, everyone felt as though they had been enlightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s like this. The mysterious nature, as well as the strength of the Sky Alliance, are not too surprising now that Family Head has ripped the mask off them.\u201d The elder with a goatee narrowed his eyes as he nodded. \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then how about we ally with the Shui Family, suppressing the Yu Family as well as saving our own clansmen? Wouldn\u2019t that be great?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could we let them off so easily? If Yu ManLou does not give me a satisfactory answer, how could this old man rest?! No matter how strong his Yu Family is, he belongs to the Heavenly Star continent and should have no part to play in the politics of the Heavenly Wind continent! The Sky Alliance might be a ferocious dragon that has crossed the seas, but how could it beat the three of us local tyrant snakes joining hands?!\u201d HuangFu YanHan grit his teeth as he viciously spoke, his eyes shining with a frosty light!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! This should be the case! We are going to see just how unbridled the Yu Family can be!\u201d The chorus of everyone present was filled with battle intent!</p><br/><p>\u201cCome early tomorrow morning, this old man will personally go and visit the head of the Shui Family, Shui ManKong. Grand Elder, please go and look for Song TianQiao right now, and negotiate a countermeasure with them. Remember to exercise restraint! Of course, Song TianQiao is someone who is steady and solid, and what I have concluded should not be something that eludes his grasp. To make the two of our families fight with each other just like that, their thinking is too simple!\u201d HuangFu YanHan spoke in a confident tone. \u201cIf the Yu Family was being discreet, then we couldn\u2019t have done anything either, but now that they dare to do it so openly, then don\u2019t blame us for being impolite! Our century-long foundation for the HuangFu aristocratic family can\u2019t be uprooted just because Yu ManLou says he wants to do so! What a nice fantasy he has! Could it be that Yu ManLou thinks he\u2019s the only genius in this world?!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yu ManLou was far away on the ocean looking at the scenery. He never would have thought that before he even managed to reach the Heavenly Wind continent he had already been burdened with the black label of a villain by someone else! If he were to find out right now, he would likely vomit blood in anger!</p><br/><p>The development of this matter was indeed too bizarre! Even if it was Ling Tian who had orchestrated this incident, he would never have thought this sort of strange scenario would occur. One had to mention that HuangFu YanHan\u2019s imagination was indeed bold and imaginative, to the point that no one could follow his thoughts, but he still could somehow frame this hypothesis in such a reasonable manner!</p><br/><p>What sort of matter was going on?!!</p><br/><p>However, if one were to pin the blame on Yu ManLou, it could still be considered plausible at this exact point in time! After all, the timing of this kidnapping was just too coincidental. Even if one were just to look at it from the surface, the greatest beneficiary of this would be the Sky Alliance, followed by the Yu Family. As such, thinking that the mastermind was Yu ManLou was actually something unavoidable! After all, the greatest winner of this sort of thing was usually the one orchestrating it!</p><br/><p>If Ling Tian were to hear of all these conjectures, he would also be dumbfounded. When he first thought of this plan, he only had the intention to stir up and muddy the waters. Not only would he throw the two families into chaos, forcing the Shui Family to step in, he would also allow Shui QianRou to benefit much more from this. Secondly, he would also reduce the influence behind the other faction in the Shui Family, and lastly, Ling Tian would use this opportunity to gain a chance to enter Mount Vacant to seek for treasure!</p><br/><p>This could be summed up into a single saying: When one has the intention to grow flowers, the plants do not bloom, but when one inadvertently plants a willow, it grows into a mighty tree to provide shade!</p><br/><p>HuangFu YanHan\u2019s guesses were actually not wrong for some parts. The head of the Song Family actually did receive a mysterious package, a tiny box. And as for the Song Family, they were actually behaving in the same manner as what HuangFu YanHan thought, running around in chaos. All of them racked their brains for the answer, and the family Head Song TianQiao flew into a rage totally unbefitting of the steady image that HuangFu YanHan had praised him for.</p><br/><p>Song TianQiao\u2019s wife, which was the birth mother of Song Kuang and Song Ao, after realizing that the life and death of her two sons were unknown along with the lack of attention from her husband for the past few years, had her heart immediately refueled with hatred. She put out a huge scene fully displaying the ability of a woman. She cried, blustered, and threatened to kill herself, torturing Song TianQiao to the point his seven orifices were literally emitting smoke.</p><br/><p>While the group discussed for a long time, they could not come to any conclusion. When they were at their wit\u2019s end, someone brought the message that the HuangFu Family\u2019s Grand Elder was here for a visit. While Song TianQiao was extremely impatient in his heart, he endured the burning desire and invited the guest in.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu ManLou! I f**k your grandmother!\u201d After hearing the summary from Grand Elder HuangFu, Song TianQiao was struck with a revelation. He stamped his feet on the ground, loudly cursing and swearing until his face was red, apoplectic with rage. Compared to how HuangFu YanHan had described him to be, Song TianQiao seemed to be poles apart in real life. With his sons and concubine missing, he was already suffering from a surplus of anxiety. Having to deal with the incessant grumbling from his wife without being able to vent his frustrations, he could only endure blindly. He was almost driven mad by this fiasco.</p><br/><p>Originally, he would put on airs whenever the HuangFu Family sent someone over, but right now, they could be considered his savior, giving him a solution out of his dilemma. Upon hearing that this entire matter was actually orchestrated by Yu ManLou, Song TianQiao could not help but seethe in rage. If Yu ManLou was present in the city right now in front of him, Song TianQiao would not hesitate to spit at him!</p><br/><p>The two men hurriedly discussed for a while, firming up a countermeasure before the HuangFu Grand Elder took his leave. Song TianQiao rearranged his bearings, before bringing a group of experts and headed towards the Shui Family with a majestic entourage of experts.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, three days had already passed.</p><br/><p>In these three days, Ling Tian had worked in the night while resting during the day, recording every single nook and cranny of Mount Vacant Sky by going round and round the area. He had scoured every area that was in accordance with his plan, which was an extremely tedious matter. Just the three peaks of Mount Vacant Sky lay among hundreds of feet of undulating ranges, and just scouting out the Eastern peak already made him perspire profusely. This had nothing to do with one\u2019s internal cultivation, but rather it was a matter of labor. Such a scouting job like this was purely reliant on one\u2019s body rather than energy.</p><br/><p>Lush forests, rugged outcroppings, steep precipice, flowing valleys\u2026 Ling Tian had expended a Herculean effort in the search for this treasure and yet came out with nothing to show for it. That saying of \u201cEast of Vacant Sky\u201d had tired him so much he was cramping everywhere.</p><br/><p>The early rays of dawn rose again, and Ling Tian could only helplessly stare at the Eastern peak of Mount Vacant Sky, viciously spitting on the ground in disgust before turning around to leave.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian, who had accompanied him for three straight nights on this fruitless search, was also drawn to the limits of his patience even though he was well known for his tempered patience. He requested permission from the Young noble to survey the task that Ling Nineteen and the rest were doing and immediately took his leave, not willing to accompany his young noble to go on this insane search.</p><br/><p>Today was also the day that Yu ManLou\u2019s ships would arrive. Ling Tian decided to let this matter drop for the moment. After the Yu Family arrived, in order to prevent them from playing any dirty tricks, the defense around the central peak of Mount Vacant Sky would also become even more guarded. This would be beneficial for Ling Tian to travel to and from the Eastern Peak.</p><br/><p>As such, Ling Tian was now extremely eager for Yu ManLou to reach the area. He was completely unaware that awaiting Yu ManLou would be a heaven-borne disaster, and this entire matter was actually orchestrated by him, as well as totally unintentionally created against Yu ManLou\u2026</p><br/><p>****** ****** ******</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou finally arrived.</p><br/><p>The Yu Family delegate could be said to have arrived with the same timing as the people from Beyond Heavens. Separated by just a distance of ten feet or so was the small boat that held four people from the Beyond Heavens Sect. While the boat that they took was not considered tiny by any standards, with cabins and a helm, it was incomparably tiny when compared to the hegemon of a boat that the Yu Family wielded.</p><br/><p>When Yu ManLou arrived, he never would have thought in his dreams, no, everybody included would never have thought in their dreams that the Yu Family\u2019s arrival at the Heavenly Wind continent would cause such a stir!</p><br/><p>The sun rose high into the sky, letting out unlimited rays of light which shone on all objects over the world. Only that the sunshine at this period was considered the most harmonious!</p><br/><p>Yu ManLou stood with his back facing the rising sun, standing with his hands behind his back at the helm of the ship. The salty and humid air of the ocean seemed to give him a feeling of meeting with a long lost friend! His entire bearing started to emit a congealed area, giving people who saw him a sense of respect. If Ling Tian were present, he would have noticed that the frosty air that was present in Yu ManLou\u2019s body had already completely vanished, melding together to become part of his body! Right now, Yu ManLou\u2019s skill could no longer be compared to when he was in Northern Wei. He naturally had undergone a tremendous breakthrough!</p><br/><p>The Soul brothers stood directly behind him, not even an inch away from their designated positions, standing stock still like two honored statues.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been a long time, Heavenly Wind continent!</p></div>\n</div>"}

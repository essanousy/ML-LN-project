Besides, now that the mission was already nearing its end, there wasn\u2019t a need for them to remain hidden! Furthermore, even Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t have the confidence to take down all of the top-notch experts in the room without making a commotion!</p><br/><p>Since all of the little shrimps had been taken care of, they must naturally have a good fight with the remaining big fishes. At this moment, Ling Jian naturally wouldn\u2019t let Ling Tian or Ling Chen take the risk to enter the room first and took the initiative to charge in without any hesitation!</p><br/><p>A couple of enraged roars could be heard before the sound of palm strikes being exchanged sounded. A sharp ray of sword qi then exploded forth from the room and the entire house was blown apart from the sharp sword qi. Three figures flew out and landed in three different directions.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s chest could be seen rising and falling. His face was frosty, his gaze was frosty, his sword was frosty and killing intent frosty!</p><br/><p>The two inside the room were only dressed in their underwear and each had an obvious sword wound. While the sword wound wasn\u2019t deep, they were injured after all. The looks that they were giving Ling Jian were filled with wariness!</p><br/><p>With a few swooshing sounds, another four individuals shot out from the houses around it. They did not come out from the door or window but broke through the roof directly. Ling Tian sneered as he looked at Li Xue. They were definitely experienced individuals!</p><br/><p>Only experienced individuals would be afraid of an ambush at the door or window and break through the roof directly. It was the safest method after all! Furthermore, they were still dressed in black robes despite it being in the middle of the night. It was obvious that the few of them were extremely experienced and careful individuals!</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest senior brother, how are you?\u201d The four black-robed individuals who came out immediately spotted the wounds on the two elders.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful and attack them together.\u201d An elder replied as he coughed twice. Being caught off guard and receiving Ling Jian\u2019s tyrannical sword qi with his palms, it was impossible for him to remain uninjured. Understanding Ling Jian\u2019s strength, how would he dare to let his guard down?</p><br/><p>Only at that point did the sound of fighting break out and the sound of miserable shrieks could be heard. However, the remaining few no longer had the strength to fight back. In fact, even escape was no more than a dream for them!</p><br/><p>Anyone of them was a well-known individual in their families and could be considered elites in both Above Heavens and the Yu Family. They never expected all of them to suffer such a miserable defeat under the hands of these unknown black-robed assailants!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ling Family?\u201d A black-robed elder looked at Ling Jian with his eagle-eyed gaze, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>In his eyes, the only one capable of threatening the six of them would be the black-robed man in front of him. As long as they could take down this black-robed man in front of them, the others wouldn\u2019t be a threat to them. Even if they were caught off guard, it would be impossible for anyone to stop the six of them if they wanted to escape! Thus, he was still extremely calm in the face of danger.</p><br/><p>With his eyesight, he could naturally tell that the one man and two ladies on the wall had an elegant disposition and were definitely exceptional individuals. However, before the three of them took action, the black-robed elder would not think that the three of them could pose a threat to him. In fact, he even felt that the three of them could be the key to turning his situation around. Wealthy young noble and ladies like them, even if they had martial arts, they definitely wouldn\u2019t have much battle experience. As long as these young noble and ladies were taken down, the entire battle would definitely be reversed.</p><br/><p>However, it was a pity that he didn\u2019t know who the three of them were. Furthermore, the three of them truly had the strength to turn the entire situation around!</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you are here in my Ling Family\u2019s territory and you actually asked such a question after being caught in the act? Could it be that all the members of the Yu Family and Above Heavens are idiots like you?\u201d Ling Jian said with a deadly tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle junior, you\u2019re seeking death!\u201d That black-robed man said with disdain, \u201cDo you think that all of you will be able to keep us from leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Ling Chi\u2019s figure darted on top of the roof and cried out, \u201cI found it! I found the herbs.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re seeking death!\u201d Two black-robed men shot towards Ling Chi ferociously upon hearing those words.</p><br/><p>A crisp shout could be heard and both Ling Chen and Li Xue shot into the air to intercept the two black-robed men. Their four palms shot out and the spring night seemed to have turned into the bitter winter night!</p><br/><p>The thick white fog spread out and the surrounding houses were covered in a layer of white frost! Even the lush greenery had begun to wilt at a visible rate!</p><br/><p>The two black-robed men let out a gasp of shock and their swords appeared in their hands. The fire torch which was originally in their hands was also thrown out. They originally intended to rush over to destroy the herbs so as to destroy all evidence of their actions. However, they never expected that these two young ladies in front of them would be so difficult to deal with. With just a single exchange, they felt their entire body freezing up and had to circulate all of their inner qi to withstand the cold. How would they dare to continue underestimating the opponent before them?</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, Ling Jian did not say another word and shot into the sky. His sword light exploded forth like the starry night and swallowed the remaining four black-robed men in his sword light. With his sword sweeping out, despite facing the combined attacks of four experts, he was actually able to easily hold his ground!</p><br/><p>The surroundings fell silent and close to fifty figures appeared from all directions on top of the roofs. They formed a large encirclement and gradually surrounded the six experts. Ling Chi and the others had cleaned up the remaining houses and gathered to reinforce Ling Tian.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian ordered, \u201cFinish the battle quickly! Half of you stay behind, half of you attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was overjoyed and immediately charged forward to surround the four black-robed men in a human wave. With the chance to beat a man who was down, how could they not charge forward to join in the fun?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian also let out a crisp roar and shot into the battle ring of Li Xue and Ling Chen. In just a short while, the beard of the two black-robed elders who were fighting already had a thick layer of frost. Their movements also turned dull and they were obviously on the losing end.</p><br/><p>As the battle continued, clanging sounds could actually be heard and their shirts had already been frozen solid. On the contrary, Ling Chen and Li Xue still seemed to be at complete ease. If not for the fact that they wanted to capture these two black-robed men, the two black-robed men would have already turned into ghosts under their blades!</p><br/><p>The might of the large completion Divine Ice Formula was unparalleled!</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d Ling Tian who had joined the battle struck one of the elders on the shoulder and the elder shot out like a rubber ball. His body no longer had the ability to even struggle in mid-air as Ling Tian had sent his inner qi through the elder\u2019s body to seal up his acupoints.</p><br/><p>Ling Lei and Ling Dian who were observing the battle from the side had a rope in their hands at the ready. The moment the black-robed elder was sent flying by Ling Tian, they threw out the ropes in their hands and swiftly tied the black-robed elder up before he even touched the ground!</p><br/><p>With another \u2018peng\u2019 sound, another elder was taken care of. He was also sent flying towards Ling Lei and Ling Dian and wrapped up into a human dumpling in just a short instant.</p><br/><p>On the other side, with thirty plus people attacking four injured individuals, the outcome could be easily imagined. Without much effort, the four black-robed men were beaten up like pig heads before they were thrown to the side.</p><br/><p>They could have been in a better state originally. When the four of them saw that they weren\u2019t a match for the enemy, they attempted to return to the room to send out a message to seek aid. In the end, Ling Jian and the others charged forward and did not show any mercy in their blows.</p><br/><p>At Ling Tian\u2019s side, only Ling Twenty-three was injured due to a moment of carelessness. Ling Twenty-three cursed under his breath as he did not know how he got injured in the big mess. However, he was certain that he definitely wasn\u2019t injured by his enemies but his own comrades. Furthermore, it was very likely that the injuries inflicted on him were intentional! If not, they definitely wouldn\u2019t have accurately struck both his eyes to give him a nice pair of panda eyes!</p><br/><p>With an order, all the members of the village were gathered together like dead pigs. After counting the number of enemies gathered, there were actually more than 600 of them!</p><br/><p>Ling Chen and Li Xue both turned around in embarrassment. Being caught off guard, the majority of the captives were not dressed properly and there were even some who were completely naked.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then ordered a couple of men to fetch the soldiers of the Courtyard and take all of these captives back. He then went to the warehouse to take a look at the herbs and could not help but take a deep breath!</p><br/><p>Bewildering grass! A full warehouse of dried bewildering grass! Furthermore, there was plenty of top-quality bewildering grass!</p><br/><p>Bewildering grass was an extremely potent knockout drug. Anyone who smelled the scent of the flower would be knocked out. A heavy dose was sufficient to knock someone out for a full day and night! Furthermore, if the bewildering grass was dried and then burned, the potency of the grass would be increased by ten times!</p><br/><p>Such grass was extremely rare and had to be kept away from sunlight. It was extremely difficult for it to grow in ordinary places. As for top-quality bewildering grass, it was even rarer. Any expert who wasn\u2019t in the XianTian realm would fall prey to the effect of the grass if they were caught off guard! To think that a whole warehouse of it would appear before Ling Tian! Even if it was intentionally cultured, how much manpower and wealth would it require? What were their objectives in expending so much wealth and manpower?</p><br/><p>With so much top quality bewildering grass present, if the wind direction was right and it was put to proper use, it was enough to make half of Sky Bearing City unconscious!</p><br/><p>Without interrogating anyone, Ling Tian already knew what their objectives were.</p><br/><p>If they lit up all of this bewildering grass during the upcoming ceremony, the outcome would be extremely frightening! Even if Ling Tian and his subordinates weren\u2019t afraid of the grass, they were few in numbers after all. There would be a hundred thousand people present in the city at the very least! Even if the bewildering grass wouldn\u2019t pose a threat to him, it would be enough to turn the entire ceremony of his Ling Family into a joke!</p></div>\n</div>"}

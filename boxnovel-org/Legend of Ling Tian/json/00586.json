A flash of light could be seen and with a lightning fast speed, the light flashed towards the broad back on the bed. Below the broad back, a snow white petite figure could be seen.</p><br/><p>Behind the mask, not a single emotion could be seen in Ling Jian\u2019s eyes. He held onto his sword and charged forward without any hesitation!</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good! An assassin, protect the master!\u201d The large bang alerted the guards on the outside and seven to eight figures dashed into the room.</p><br/><p>All of the guards also moved together and charged towards the assassin together with fear on their faces.</p><br/><p>However, it was all too late!</p><br/><p>Under the careful planning and execution of the First Pavilion Head, even if it was the fastest in the continent, Ling Tian, or the number one expert in the world, Justice, they would only be able to kill Ling Jian but not protect his target.</p><br/><p>From the moment Ling Jian took action, DongFang MingRi\u2019s death sentence was already determined! Mercy was impossible!</p><br/><p>In truth, DongFang MingRi himself was also considered a martial arts expert but after ascending to the throne for so many years, his indulgence in alcohol and beauties had already sucked him dry. His vitality was also greatly injured in the battle with the DongFang Family\u2019s assassin. At this moment, he was at his weakest and most frail state. Together with the fact that Ling Jian\u2019s martial arts were a notch above his, by the time he realized that something was wrong, he did not even have the chance to get up before feeling a piercing cold at his back.</p><br/><p>The moment he felt this piercing cold at his back, the strength of his body seemed to have disappeared instantly like it was a balloon being pierced by a needle. He then felt the cold blade being quickly retracted before losing all feeling. He did not even have the time to turn behind to see who exactly was the one who killed him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCatch him!\u201d A few of the guards released their most powerful attacks and hidden weapons flew over like rain. Palms, knives, swords and hidden weapons smashed onto the black figure together and with a \u2018kacha\u2019 sound, something sounded like it was smashed\u2026</p><br/><p>Another black figure then flashed out of the opening in the roof like a shooting star. Before the three experts who dashed onto the roof could jump down into the opening, they saw this black-robed figure dash out of the hole. The three of them quickly changed their direction and tried to block the black-robed figure.</p><br/><p>At the same time, a row of archers was lined up neatly along the walls with their arrows gleaming under the moonlight.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s speeding figure suddenly froze in mid-air before descending rapidly to welcome the three experts that had just jumped up. With a cold glare in his eyes, a bright silver light exploded forth from his sword. Thousands of sword shadows appeared with the grim reaper\u2019s glow!</p><br/><p>\u201cAHH!!!\u201d Three consecutive wails sounded and the three experts drifted down like three kites with their strings cut. On all of their bodies, at least a dozen slashes could be seen! As their figures lifelessly fell from the sky, countless blood plumes also sprayed out from their bodies like fireworks exploding in mid-air.</p><br/><p>An order sounded and a sky full of arrows flooded over with swooshing sounds!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s figure rose up and down, weaving swiftly through the rain of arrows. Like a gust of wind, he approached the wall. Brandishing his sword he deflected a few dozen arrows and landed on top of the wall. The moment he landed on the wall, he let out a roar and his sword light shot out in all directions. The archers which were originally lined up along the wall let out a series of miserable wails before falling down like dumplings.</p><br/><p>Another five experts quickly sped over only to see Ling Jian jumping over the wall and speeding away. A cloud of arrows shot towards Ling Jian, creating a series of sparks wherever the arrows landed but not a single arrow was able to catch up to Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbfounded at the scene. Was there really someone with such speed in the world?</p><br/><p>The black-robed man who was already a long distance away suddenly paused in mid-air and shot towards a tree like an eagle. Stepping on the topmost branch of the tree, the black-robed man stood up proudly. He then turned around to face the troops chasing after him and his two ferocious eyes pierced through the air with prestige!</p><br/><p>As the five experts who were chasing after Ling Jian saw his gaze, they felt like there was a sharp sword was pressing on their faces and they could even feel a prickly feeling on their cheeks! Their figures could not help but pause in mid-air.</p><br/><p>As Ling Jian watched these few people, he could not help but sneer. His contemptuous and disdainful gaze swept past the five of them before shooting into the sky. In just the blink of an eye, he was a hundred feet away, and with another flash, he disappeared completely.</p><br/><p>The five of them was completely astonished, Just who was this assassin?! One of them then roared, \u201cHiding like a coward is unbecoming of a hero! Do you dare to leave your name behind?\u201d</p><br/><p>From far off, a disdainful laugh could be heard, \u201cAre the lot of you even worthy of taking revenge?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just when all of them felt despair and hopelessness, a voice drifted over and entered the ears of those present, \u201cThe lives of all humans are in my hands, the winds and rains heed the first pavilion!\u201d</p><br/><p>The five experts turned pale with fright!</p><br/><p>The First Pavilion!</p><br/><p>He was actually an assassin from the First Pavilion! The assassin from the First Pavilion was actually so frightening?!</p><br/><p>Thinking about how they were just commenting about the experts of the world and the First Pavilion, they all could not help but blush with shame!</p><br/><p>The five of them then looked at their three brothers who were completely bloodied with blood still gushing out of their bodies and staining the ground\u2026</p><br/><p>From the yard, a loud shriek could be heard coming from the room, \u201cEmperor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The five of them trembled and their figures quickly retreated back to the door. The moment they entered the room, their bodies stiffened up and a look of incredulity could be seen on their faces.</p><br/><p>The monarch of the Eastern Zhao Empire, DongFang MingRi, had turned into a cold corpse just like that. His body was still naked and everyone could tell that after the assassin took action, this Eastern Zhao monarch did not even have the time to react! Without the chance to even react, he was killed with a single sword!</p><br/><p>In just a couple of breaths, this assassin broke through the roof and killed their monarch with a lightning fast speed. He then threw his jacket over a clothes hanger and threw it out the door as a distraction before he escaped from the roof himself. He even had the time to kill three experts before traversing a hundred feet with a single jump. In the face of 2000 archers, he had actually left without the slightest bit of anxiousness or obstruction!</p><br/><p>Everything happened in just a couple of breaths! Before the assassination attempt had begun, it had already ended!</p><br/><p>It was too swift, swift to the point one would be astonished, shocked, and filled with disbelief!</p><br/><p>Feeling the remnant warmth on their Emperor\u2019s body, everyone felt their hearts turned cold!</p><br/><p>With a loud \u2018peng\u2019, the entrance to an underground tunnel was pushed open and a couple of burly men dashed over, \u201cThere is an assassin, we have\u2026\u201d Looking at the situation before their eyes, they fell into a daze\u2026</p><br/><p>******</p><br/><p>Ling Jian had already left Blazing Sun City and was currently sprinting freely in the grasslands.</p><br/><p>Although they successfully assassinated DongFang MingRi, Ling Jian did not even have the slightest bit of delight throughout the whole process. In fact, he even felt a tinge of depression.</p><br/><p>Killing a monarch had always been Ling Jian\u2019s biggest wish as an assassin. He had even been envious of Ling Chi because Ling Chi killed the Northern Wei monarch. Now that the monarch of an empire had finally died under his sword, Ling Jian should have been extremely excited but only felt as though he had killed an ordinary individual. It was no different from killing an ordinary corrupt official or vicious businessman. He even had a feeling of boredom.</p><br/><p>During this assassination attempt, the only thing that was of interest to Ling Jian was the large improvement in his movement techniques, swordplay, and inner qi. However, the excitement he used to have after killing someone was no longer present, even if the one he killed this time was a monarch.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Ling Tian\u2019s calm appearance surfaced in Ling Jian\u2019s heart and a voice sounded, Killing someone is no more than turning a living person into a corpse. What is so exciting about that?</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s speeding figure suddenly stopped and he looked at the night sky with enlightenment.</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether he was killing a beggar, family head, or emperor, it was no more than wiping out a human life with his sword. Regardless of how noble his status was when he was alive, he was no more than a corpse and a pile of mush! On this point alone, an emperor and a beggar had no difference! There wasn\u2019t a difference between good and bad, man or woman!</p><br/><p>His only job was to turn men into corpses. Why should he be bothered about the status of the other party? Regardless of how noble a person was when alive, one could only turn into a corpse after meeting him!</p><br/><p>It really wasn\u2019t a big deal at all.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it in such a manner, Ling Jian suddenly felt that the blood boiling excitement that he felt whenever he killed a \u2018big character\u2019 and the envy he felt towards his brother killing a monarch was no more than a huge joke.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed out loud to the heavens and did a couple of backflips before crying out in ecstasy, \u201cI finally understand, I finally understand. HAHAHAHA\u2026 I finally understand! It is nothing more than this! HAHAHA\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A long while later\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Jian started unleashing his movement techniques and sped off in another direction. It was the direction of his next target.</p><br/><p>If someone who knew Ling Jian saw his current expression, they would definitely be able to realize something different about him because the difference was just that obvious\u2026</p><br/><p>The usual coldness and strict control of his face had completely disappeared and in its place was calmness and tranquility\u2026</p><br/><p>His edge and sharpness had completely disappeared and the current Ling Jian seemed extremely ordinary.</p><br/><p>If he walked in a crowd, he would definitely be quickly overlooked\u2026 No one would be able to tell that he was a peerless expert who was numb from killing. They would only think that he was an older boy from an ordinary household. In truth, Ling Jian was truly considered an older boy and according to Ling Tian\u2019s age of this world, he was only a \u2018small\u2019 boy!</p><br/><p>After an endless amount of killing, Ling Jian had finally achieved the request that Ling Tian had of him!</p><br/><p>Being an assassin with the attitude of a commoner and killing people with a normal heart.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t anyone who couldn\u2019t be killed in the world. Why not face it with a peaceful heart. Everything is as it should be!</p><br/><p>Even if my sword is stained with blood, my heart will be still. The lake of my heart is like a mirror, the tumbling waves will not stir it.</p><br/><p>To Ling Jian, this was a gigantic breakthrough. It could also be considered to be an obvious boundary in Ling Jian\u2019s assassination life and also a milestone in his life!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s calm figure disappeared in the horizon\u2026</p><br/><p>******</p><br/><p>A day later, all the organizations on the continent were aware of the Ling Family cutting off the Blue Jade River and drowning the Xiao Family\u2019s Heavenly Water Ravine Pass. They cut off the Xiao Family army\u2019s communication with their headquarters and had swallowed the 150,000 Xiao army led by Xiao FengYang!</p><br/><p>The whole continent was filled with commotion!</p><br/><p>Two days later, more shocking news spread across the continent. The Eastern Zhao Emperor, DongFang MingRi, was assassinated in Blazing Sun City by an assassin of the First Pavilion!</p><br/><p>Following the assassination of their Emperor, the Eastern Zhao Empire was split into pieces and fell into complete chaos. Under the lead of General Shen RuHu, the Ling Family army worked together with DongFang Family Head, DongFang JingLei, and openly attacked Eastern Zhao. He was currently facing the third army of the Xiao Family in Eastern Zhao.</p><br/><p>This news shocked the entire continent!</p><br/><p>The third day!</p><br/><p>Before they could sober up from their shock, another shocking news was spread out. The third Xiao army was stopped in Eastern Zhao and fought a large battle with the Ling Family\u2019s Shen RuHu. After the battle started for a day, the Xiao Family general, Xiao JinShan, lost his head in his own tent. On the morning of the second day, Xiao JinShan\u2019s head was hung up on a pole before the formation of the two armies!</p><br/><p>The Xiao Family\u2019s army was defeated without a battle!</p><br/><p>The whole of Eastern Zhao landed in the hands of the Ling Family! Although it was still in chaos, everyone understood that it was impossible for such an unorganized mess to block the advancement of the Ling Family. It was only a matter of time before Eastern Zhao became part of the Ling Family\u2019s territory.</p><br/><p>Just when the consecutive pieces of news shook everyone on the continent into speechless shock, another bit of groundbreaking news was disseminated from the south.</p><br/><p>After General Ling Xiao\u2019s army swallowed Southern Zheng, not only did they not retreat, the started an intense battle with the second army of the Xiao Family. Just when both their armies were similar in might which resulted in the number of casualties increasing by the day, the news from all across the continent threw the morale of the Xiao army into chaos and they no longer had the heart to battle.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, the general of the Xiao army, Xiao YinFeng was assassinated in his tent. The assassin was spotted when coming out from the commander\u2019s tent, and after a bitter battle, the assassin left with heavy injuries. The next day, Xiao YinFeng\u2019s head was also hung in front of the army.</p><br/><p>The outcome of the battle was no longer a mystery. Apart from the leftover 100,000 plus soldiers who surrendered, the others escaped for their lives in a single night. The Ling Family army was currently clearing up the mess in Southern Zheng.</p><br/><p>From then on, there wasn\u2019t a Southern Zheng or Eastern Zhao in the world any longer!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

If he had acted, even if he couldn\u2019t have saved more people from the green-robed man, he would have at least prevented the deaths of her two elders! Upon thinking of the tragic deaths of the two Zheng elders, Shui QianRou lamented, Why?! Why didn\u2019t you act earlier?!</p><br/><p>Did he really act late? If he had waited a while longer, let alone Die\u2019er, even she would have found it difficult to leave alive. He just needed to save himself at the critical juncture, but she didn\u2019t even have a hint of appreciation!</p><br/><p>As to why Ling Tian would actually save her, there had to be a reason. Was he in love with her? Shui QianRou couldn\u2019t help but laugh coldly to herself. Definitely not! There had to be a greater scheme somewhere!</p><br/><p>Indeed, she had once been prideful of her intellect and charm, but upon meeting Ling Tian, all of those flew out of the window! He wouldn\u2019t drool at her beauty and didn\u2019t even develop thoughts of taking her for his own! Or else, he wouldn\u2019t have sat on the sidelines and watched, only taking action at the end and leaving the two elders to die!</p><br/><p>However, Shui QianRou had actually neglected a very important point in her analysis, and that was the fact that she had always been at odds with Ling Tian! From start to end, while she had always seemed friendly, they never were allies to begin with, but instead mortal enemies! Just like how she dared to plot against Ling Tian, he could naturally do the same to her!</p><br/><p>Ladies, their line of thought was just so illogical at times! Even the intelligent Shui QianRou wasn\u2019t an exception!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble Ling, this lady here thanks young noble for saving my life, and I\u2019ll find a way to repay it. If you have nothing else for me, then we\u2019ll bid farewell here. The mountains are high and rivers long, there will be another time where we cross paths.\u201d Holding onto the lapels of her clothes with a hand, she calmly stated. While her tone sounded calm and even, her heart was trembling. Now that she had put out all her cards, it was time to see what Ling Tian was going to respond with!</p><br/><p>Escape was never an option to begin with!</p><br/><p>In this time period, Ling Tian was gathering fallen pine needles into a pile, away from the forest. He then lit up some tinder, and set the dry needles on fire, causing a huge plume of smoke to rise. Without any breeze present, the smoke rose unhindered up to the sky.</p><br/><p>Seeing the fire, Shui QianRou coldly smiled. That was the signal to his subordinates, right? In his eyes, I\u2019m already his prisoner!</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Brother Qian is too polite. This is only a coincidental meeting, and it\u2019s nothing worth mentioning. However,\u201d Ling Tian smiled and purposely dragged the next few words, \u201cBrother Qian, oh no, it should be Miss Shui, you want to leave so soon? Don\u2019t you think you left something unfinished?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou immediately became more vigilant. He indeed had a motive! She cautiously asked, \u201cAs a lady, it is inconvenient for me to roam the pugilistic world and so I disguised myself as a male. I didn\u2019t mean to fool young noble, and as for unfinished business? I don\u2019t understand, can young noble please explain further?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed jovially, but the expression in his eyes was as cold as a drawn blade, \u201cWith Miss Shui\u2019s intellect, did you actually forget that I, Ling Tian, am the son of Ling Xiao?! In that case, what do you think I\u2019m referring to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s heart leaped, thinking in a panic, Does he already know something? Or did someone reveal something to him?\u2019 If someone has exposed this situation, then there would be no room for retreat! Her facial expressions bore no signs of her inward struggle as she softly replied, \u201cYoung noble Ling is indeed Great General Ling\u2019s son, this is a fact known to all. This lady here definitely understands that, so why is young noble trying to joke with me? This is making me confused!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed again and changed the topic. He spoke with a light tone, \u201cAs everyone knows, the little miss of the Yu Family, Yu BingYan has a relationship with me, and furthermore, I\u2019m good friends with Third Master Yu. The Yu Family is also the number one martial arts aristocratic family, with deep roots, and it definitely has the power to destroy my family! However, Miss Shui actually moved to assassinate Yu BingYan and me in Smoky Thea Tower!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then smiled mockingly as he raised his head, \u201cYet today I, Ling Tian, not only saved the lady that tried to assassinate me but ended up killing two elders of the Yu Family, creating a blood feud! Does Miss Shui know why?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s heart sank, and the wound at her chest also started to hurt as she forcefully replied, \u201cThis lady here thanks young noble for your graciousness once again. As the saying goes, \u2018Meeting injustice in the road, a man roots it out. Meeting the weak being bullied, he extends a helping hand\u2019. The Yu Family elders were tyrannical and unreasonable, bullying a lady like me. Because young noble is soft-hearted and righteous, he saved me! This lady here has only this thought of you as my savior with no other thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou was indeed a worthy successor of Water of Heavenly Wind. Not only was her intellect above others, she was able to speak in a calm tone despite being in an awkward situation. With just a few words, she portrayed Ling Tian as a hero who was upright and responsible, and refused to deviate from her stand!</p><br/><p>Sadly, her opponent was Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian snorted coldly, \u201cI am friendly with Yu ManTian and have a liking for Miss Yu, and furthermore the Yu Family is not someone I can resist singlehandedly. However, I actually went out of my way to kill two Yu Family elders just to save a mortal enemy. Don\u2019t you think that is odd? Or did you really imagine that I\u2019m some sort of hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou replied in a firm manner, but with an even gentler tone, \u201cYoung noble has a remarkable ability and is exceptionally talented. Thus, how could the things that he does be explained by mortal\u2019s logic?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed and just stared at her. His eyes seemed to pierce right inside her, and after a while, he lowered his gaze, but spat out directly, \u201cNorthern Wei and Sky Bearing seem to have given the Shui Family quite a few benefits, right? Or else, how could they ever persuade the Water of Heavenly Wind?\u201d This simple sentence, though softly spoken out, resounded like thunder in her ears!</p><br/><p>If it were an ordinary day, then Shui QianRou wouldn\u2019t have felt anything, but with a serious injury and the lack of internal energy, Ling Tian\u2019s energy-infused voice made her head spin and muddled her thoughts. She closed her eyes to focus before answering, \u201cThis miss here really doesn\u2019t know what young noble Ling is talking about. Your words to me are like the wind and clouds, mist and fog; ephemeral and unknowing. Thus, I cannot answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian burst out into laughter at her act, but one could hear the coldness in it! \u201cMiss Shui, then I\u2019ll let you know and also let you understand, and even more let you answer all my questions!\u201d He ruthlessly continued, \u201cI really want to know if this plan will still succeed without an important character like you. Without the support of Water of Heavenly Wind, can the stupid b*st*rd Northern Wei Crown Prince as well as the good-for-nothing Long Xiang actually still pull something off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou\u2019s eyes lit up, but quickly dimmed, and hesitatingly bit on her lips, refusing to answer.</p><br/><p>The sounds of rustling came from afar. Obviously, there were many people rushing over.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian stood up and coolly spoke, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if Miss Shui is willing to cooperate or not. The Ling Family is also very appreciative of you and allowing Miss Shui to be a guest for an indefinite time at our house until you feel like speaking is an easy thing. This young noble is not worried at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>A cold light shot through Shui QianRou\u2019s eyes as she retorted, \u201cJust now you were saying how your family couldn\u2019t resist the Yu Family. However, the same applies to my family! While you can hide me for a while, but after a long period, the Ling Family will definitely get caught!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou had decided to use the prestige of Water of Heavenly Wind to pressure Ling Tian, but they were all alarmist threats, with nothing of substance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian coldly smiled, \u201cWater of Heavenly Wind; Jade of Heavenly Star. Both are existences this young noble cannot provoke\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou didn\u2019t show any expression as she knew Ling Tian had not finished his sentence. For someone who dared to kill a Yu Family elder, how could he be afraid of retaliation?</p><br/><p>Indeed, Ling Tian continued, \u201cBut Miss is mistaken of one fact. You were pursued your whole journey, in danger of being killed, and luckily, the Yu Family Elders decided to lend a helping hand. However, in the face of the supreme expert, their skills were lacking, and you still got kidnapped in the end! If the Yu and Shui families would want to pursue the matter, they would look for that green-robed man, so why would they bother searching my Ling Family? But does either family have the capability to go after that green-robed man?\u201d</p><br/><p>A look of despair finally surfaced in Shui QianRou\u2019s eyes! Ling Tian was indeed ingenious, even dragging the frighteningly powerful expert into his calculations! With the strength of that green-robed man, the Yu and Shui Families would sound the drums for retreat instead, unwilling to make an enemy out of someone whom they couldn\u2019t afford to offend!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian definitely was aware of the plans of the Shui Family and indeed didn\u2019t save Shui QianRou out of goodwill! However, he left out something in his calculations.</p><br/><p>\u201cLing Tian, you shameless beast! Is this how you treat my family\u2019s little princess?!\u201d Die\u2019er\u2019s furious voice sounded. \u201cThe little princess is only doing this because of the orders from her family. I\u2019ve already lost count of the number of times she was looking at you in secret. Our family\u2019s young miss has taken a liking to you, but you treat her this way? Where is your conscience? Ling Tian, you\u2019re worse than a beast!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

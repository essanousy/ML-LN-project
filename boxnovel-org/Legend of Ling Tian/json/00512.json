The scab falling from Ling Tian\u2019s arm was as though it was a layer of extremely dry soil cracking up and it actually dropped off from Ling Tian\u2019s body without needing Ling Tian to do anything. At the same time, Ling Tian felt his body beginning to itch all over. Looking at Xiao YanXue, Ling Tian smiled sneakily and with a \u2018shua\u2019 sound, he stripped down naked leaving behind a pair of shorts, displaying his wonderful figure in front of the young maiden in front of him.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue let out a gasp and was embarrassed to the point her face flushed red, \u201cYou\u2026 why are you so shameless?!\u201d Just when she was about to cover her eyes, she suddenly let out a gasp of incredulity. She stared at Ling Tian\u2019s naked body and stammered, \u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026 just what is going on? You\u2026 you have actually recovered fully?!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the eyes of this kind lady, the recovery of Ling Tian\u2019s injuries was far more important than her shyness or apprehensions! As long as her beloved man\u2019s injuries could recover, it wouldn\u2019t matter if he was wearing less. In any case, she had already seen and even touched all of him!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was like a snake shedding its skin, with his old layer of skin peeling and falling off his body and the new layer smooth and soft. Any lady who saw his soft and silky skin would definitely be extremely envious.</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian circulated his inner qi, the scabs and dry skin on his body fell off quicker and quicker. It was as though Ling Tian had previously fallen into a puddle of mud and was completely drenched in mud but had all of the mud flaking off his body at this moment. With a final jerk of his body, all the remaining scabs fell off without a single bit left on his body.</p><br/><p>In just a single breath, Ling Tian\u2019s body was like a smooth rock and not a since scar could be seen.</p><br/><p>Xiao YanXue\u2019s mouth was wide opened with shock and as she thought about a story that her grandfather told her, she began stuttering, \u201cStrip\u2026 strip\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was stunned for a moment. Just what does this lass mean? She actually wants me to continue stripping? But I am wearing nothing but my pants at this moment. If I continue stripping, wouldn\u2019t it mean that\u2026 but since a beauty asked me to take it off, it would be inexcusable for me to not comply. Since she has already seen it before, seeing it once more wouldn\u2019t matter. I have to fulfill the request of the crowd\u2026 As such, young noble Ling pulled down his pants without hesitation.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xiao YanXue finally composed herself from her previous shock and finished her incomplete sentence, \u201c\u2026stripping off the old to achieve a miraculous change?!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Xiao YanXue\u2019s words left her mouth, the last piece of Ling Tian\u2019s clothes also left his body and little young noble Ling stood up proudly in front of Xiao YanXue. After being restrained for so many days, little young noble Ling was naturally extremely robust\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 go and die! Who asked you to take that off? You are just too despicable!\u201d Xiao YanXue covered her face in embarrassment, \u201cDarn scoundrel. Darn baddie! Darn lecher!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing that he had misunderstood Xiao YanXue, Ling Tian attempted to quibble, \u201cI wasn\u2019t willing to strip down naked but you were the one who asked me to strip\u2026 but right after I stripped, you are acting in such a manner. Sigh, women are truly unreasonable creatures\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked you to strip?! I am going to ask you to die right now! Why aren\u2019t you going to die?!\u201d Xiao YanXue sent a flying kick towards Ling Tian\u2019s butt and sent the naked Ling Tian right into the pond with a loud splashing sound. She then stomped her feet angrily and dashed back to the tent.</p><br/><p>In the entire world, Miss Xiao was probably the only person capable of sending Ling Tian flying with a single kick! Even Justice would probably be incapable of performing such a feat!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian supported himself up in the water and wiped off the water on his face with a depressed feeling. \u201cWomen are truly incomprehensible creatures.\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Ling Tian\u2019s expression turned serious and he jumped out of the pond, dashing into the tent like a gust of wind. Amidst Xiao YanXue\u2019s embarrassed shrieks, Ling Tian quickly fished for his clothes and put them on swiftly.</p><br/><p>He could clearly hear that there were countless troops surrounding him from all directions. It was as though the whole mountain had already been surrounded by troops\u2026</p><br/><p>Why are all of these men here? Could they have found my whereabouts? However, this place is extremely well concealed and apart from Justice, there shouldn\u2019t be anyone in the world capable of locating me with such accuracy. Even Justice would only be able to locate me if he uses his \u2018Heavenly Vision, Boundless Hearing\u2019 skill! If I have the intention of concealing myself, I believe that even Justice wouldn\u2019t be able to find me.</p><br/><p>Why are these men here?</p><br/><p>As Ling Tian put on his clothes, he went through all the different possibilities in his head. All of a sudden, he came to a realization. It must have been because of the strange glow that was given out by the jade pendant. It dyed the pond into a jade green color and under the reflection of the sun, a mystical scene must have been formed and many of them were probably drawn here by that. It was definitely comparable to the abnormal phenomenon of a treasure being born in the world and together with the sword qi of the Heaven Splitter shooting towards the sky, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for so many people to have been attracted.</p><br/><p>It seems that there must be a few unlucky souls who are gathered here in search of a treasure. It wouldn\u2019t matter if they are ordinary individuals but if they are enemies\u2026 I will have to apologize to them! Facing the baleful Ling Tian, it can be said that they were only walking into their own demise. With the two of them presently being in the Eastern Zhao territory, it wouldn\u2019t be surprising for the incoming men to be from the Eastern Zhao army.</p><br/><p>After all, they were less than a hundred miles from the capital of Eastern Zhao, the Eastern Sun City. According to Ling Tian\u2019s intelligence, ever since DongFang JingLei returned to Eastern Zhao, he should have been lingering around in this area. He did not exit the Eastern Zhao territory and enter the Xiao Family\u2019s territory, or return to his home. He was like a floating ghost, floating around the wilderness without a place to take root.</p><br/><p>Only Ling Tian knew that DongFang JingLei was actually waiting for him and the promise which he gave to DongFang JingLei. It seems that Ling Twenty-two had already delivered his word to DongFang JingLei. Thus, Ling Tian\u2019s motive for appearing here was actually for the DongFang Family!</p><br/><p>A sharp killing intent flashed past Ling Tian\u2019s eyes!</p><br/><p>From the movements in the surroundings, Ling Tian was able to deduce that the people surrounding the mountain were extremely well organized and densely gathered. They were surrounding the mountain densely to prevent anyone or anything from escaping the mountain! If they had only approached Ling Tian from a single direction, it would suggest that they were only curious individuals. But by surrounding Ling Tian from all directions, it showed their intense desire to possess the \u2018treasure\u2019 in the mountain! At the same time, their killing intent was unconcealed!</p><br/><p>They only had a single motive: a treasure was born and they wanted to possess it! Regardless of whether or not the treasure had an owner or anyone who saw and knew about it, they would definitely be within these premises. Thus, the DongFang army would approach in such a manner with the intention of killing everyone on this mountain to snatch the treasure and prevent news of it from spreading out!</p><br/><p>Thus, Ling Tian was enraged! Even if he knew that the treasure was no longer present or rather that it had never existed and that these men would only return empty handed! Their current actions were no different from being a joke.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian did not want to turn them into jokes; he wanted to turn them into corpses!</p><br/><p>The only thing that these men deserved was death! This was because they treated their own personal gains far above the lives of everyone else! How would Ling Tian be able to let off these men who viewed life as dirt?</p><br/><p>Feeling the dense killing intent flowing out of Ling Tian\u2019s body, Xiao YanXue could not help but ask, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Did something happen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled in an expressionless manner. \u201cNothing\u2019s wrong. There are some people who are here to offer themselves to my sword. Their timing is perfect!\u201d That\u2019s right, just when the Heaven Splitter landed in Ling Tian\u2019s hands, these men had gathered over before Ling Tian had a chance to even use it. It was akin to giving Ling Tian a chance to have a red and prosperous beginning with his sword!</p><br/><p>\u201cOffer themselves to your sword?\u201d Xiao YanXue was puzzled. Before she could react to what Ling Tian had said, Ling Tian covered his face with a mask and disappeared from the tent leaving behind a single phrase, \u201cHide yourself well and don\u2019t let anyone find you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s figure drifted tens of feet out and watched dozens of men approaching him. He could even hear someone mumbling, \u201cStrange, we should be approaching the treasure already but why did it suddenly disappear? Could it be that the treasure can only be seen by the fated one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust continue walking forward. We should be near and there shouldn\u2019t be any mistakes,\u201d another voice sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe crown prince has instructed us to kill anyone we see. Fated individual? Ha! The fated individual would only become a dead individual! However, there doesn\u2019t seem to be anyone around here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there isn\u2019t the so-called fated individual, won\u2019t our lives be easier? Haha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Crown prince? Could it be the Eastern Zhao crown prince, DongFang XingChen?! Ling Tian was immediately energized. He originally thought that he would only be fishing for some small shrimps or fishes but never expected it to be a huge fish. Perhaps he should make some adjustments to his plan\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian began to think about just what he should do to obtain the greatest benefits.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook, there is a tent over there! Let\u2019s go and take a look and we may find something.\u201d On the other side, a sound of surprise could be heard.</p><br/><p>A glow flashed past Ling Tian\u2019s eyes and the Heaven Splitter left its sheath without a single sound. With an illusory and indistinct carefree motion it followed Ling Tian\u2019s figure. At the same time, seven men clutched onto their necks that were already spewing out blood\u2026 They collapsed onto the ground with multiple soft thuds.</p><br/><p>A dense bloody smell swiftly spread across the place.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

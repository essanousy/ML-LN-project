If not for the commander of the army having an extremely high prestige among the soldiers, a mutiny probably would have broken out. Yu ManLou was furious because of this robbery and all of his subordinates had run around till their legs were almost broken but could not find the culprit of the robbery. As disciples of the Yu Family, how could they be unaware of this robbery? However, they never expected the mastermind to appear in front of them and boast about his deeds so openly. It was as though he was afraid that others did not know of his deeds and that he had completed an extremely glorious deed. This was something unforgivable!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, you actually dare to slander our Yu Family? How bold! Report your name if you really have the guts!\u201d A black-robed individual remained seated and roared. His voice was extremely loud but it was filled with dense killing intent. When his voice traveled into the ears of those present, they could immediately feel an extremely oppressive aura in the hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu Family?! There is actually someone from the Yu Family here?!\u201d The group of people at the two tables quietened down immediately and their gazes shot over.</p><br/><p>One of the Yu Family then burst out laughing, \u201cHow interesting. How coincidental. HAHAHA, let\u2019s see all of you continue bragging. Look at how all of you bragged until the point the main character appeared. Didn\u2019t you say that the Yu Family was worthless? Hurry up and go settle them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment these words were said, many people from the two tables could not help but laugh at their misfortune. However, there was something extremely clear. Even when the Yu Family members were in front of them, these individuals were not bothered at all!</p><br/><p>The ten members from the Yu Family immediately had their doubts diminished. They originally thought that these bandits were provoking them intentionally after noticing their presence. However, it seemed like that wasn\u2019t the case. However, they would definitely not let the person who proclaimed that he robbed the Yu Family escape. They would rather kill an innocent party than risk letting him go.</p><br/><p>The entire Yu Family was thrown into chaos because of this. Now that they had a clue, how could they let him escape?</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, you were the one who said that you robbed our Yu Family\u2019s grain? Yes or no?\u201d The black-robed individual asked coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad, it indeed was this daddy! Military grain? Hahaha, it has already entered the cycle of Samara! What about it? You want to take me in?\u201d That boorish teen laughed maniacally, \u201cI am afraid that you don\u2019t have that ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ten Yu Family individuals stood up at the same time. In their trip to Sky Bearing, while Yu ManLou had instructed them to be extremely careful and not stir trouble before they could contact the members of Above Heavens, they were unable to keep their cool in front of the robber who had stolen their military grain!</p><br/><p>Seeing that both parties were about to break out into a fight, a gentle voice suddenly sounded, \u201cMay all our honored guests quell your anger. The Ling Family is about to set up their empire and has given strict orders to prevent any mess in Sky Bearing. If any fatalities were to occur in either party, this Smoky Thea Tower will probably have to be shut down. Regardless of the enmity between both parties, it would be best if both parties can take a step back and find another place to settle your scores! I shall thank all of you here!\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who spoke up was the owner of the Smoky Thea Tower, Gu XiYan. While she sounded like she was trying to stop both parties from fighting, there was another hidden layer to her words. Rather than say that she was trying to stop the fight, she was giving advice to the various individuals present. As long as there were no fatalities, it wouldn\u2019t be considered a mess. As for finding another place to settle scores, both the Yu Family members and the youth would probably be unwilling\u2026</p><br/><p>Indeed, one off the youths burst out into laughter, \u201cRest assured beauty, this king here will only teach these Yu Family scum a lesson and will definitely not kill. While we do not place the Yu Family in our sights, we will not dare to provoke young noble Ling. In Sky Bearing, who would dare to not give young noble Ling some face?\u201d</p><br/><p>These words had enraged the ten members from the Yu Family further! These words seem to imply that Ling Tian was far more powerful that Yu ManLou! Outrageous!</p><br/><p>Gu XiYan smiled without saying another word. After saying the previous words, her mission was already accomplished and she would naturally take her leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! The Yu Family actually dares to come to Sky Bearing to catch my brother! Brothers, fight it out with them!\u201d A youth shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cCripple them all! Look at their ghastly appearances! Looking at them makes me sick! So it turns out that they were from the Yu Family. No wonder they have such an evil appearance!\u201d Another individual added on.</p><br/><p>\u201cFight! Beat them all up! Beat them up from north to south to\u2026\u201d The more than ten bandit leaders cried out and charged forward with stools in their hands.</p><br/><p>The members of the Yu Family flew into a rage! These bandits had actually charged forward before they had even taken action! They obviously didn\u2019t place our Yu Family in their eyes! Unwilling to back down, they charged forward as well and the place fell into a mess.</p><br/><p>The three souls and seven bodies of the Yu Family were all famous experts and any one of their martial arts wasn\u2019t to be underestimated. When they were fighting together, they even had a formation that they had learned. With the aid of the formation, their collective strength was far greater than the sum of their individual strengths! However, they never expected the more than ten bandit kings to work together flawlessly with a great deal of chemistry between them. Their defenses and attacks were well coordinated and the chemistry between them wasn\u2019t lesser than the chemistry between the three souls and seven bodies!</p><br/><p>In just a short instant, both parties had injuries all over but none of them were willing to back down.</p><br/><p>Of the three souls and seven bodies, the bearded elder in the middle of the formation felt depression in his heart. While the ten of them were not considered top-notch experts in the Yu Family, their combination attack was something that even Yu ManLou would not dare attempt.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, if their strength were to be ranked in the entire world, they would definitely be able to rank in the top 100! Now that the ten of them were working together, not only were they unable to gain the upper hand, they actually felt as though their hands were tied up and restrained! This was an extremely puzzling matter!</p><br/><p>As the bandit kings took action, while their actions seemed like a complete mess, their actions actually followed an orderly pattern that came from strict training. For example, when the pale-faced teen charged forward, looking as though he was launching an attack and revealing large openings, his flanks were actually covered by the two companions beside him who were unleashing their own attacks. Each of their attacks had covered the opening of the other and formed an extremely well-hidden trap. If anyone attacked the place where the opening was, he would definitely face the combined attack of the three!</p><br/><p>If these bandits had only met each other in passing, how would they be able to work together with such chemistry? But if they were intentionally stirring trouble to fight them, what was their motive?</p><br/><p>Just when he was in thought, a youth shouted loudly, \u201cThese fellows from the Yu Family are too powerful. This daddy can\u2019t beat them and my nose is already red. Shall we escape?\u201d</p><br/><p>Another one laughed out loud, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if your nose is red. As long as your little bird does not see red.\u201d</p><br/><p>A furious roar sounded, \u201cNonsense! Even if we can\u2019t win, you can\u2019t say escape. You should say retreat!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat retreat? It is obviously a strategic repositioning. Tsk, don\u2019t you even have the slightest bit of culture?!\u201d another person corrected.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 shall we make a strategic repositioning?\u201d A few cried out together. \u201cI can\u2019t take it anymore. This battle is too intense and I am already severely injured. Look at how big my bruise is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Since the fight is so tough, listen to my orders. One, two, three. Brothers, let us scram!\u201d All of a sudden, the sound of retreating footsteps could be heard and the benches came flying towards the Yu Family\u2019s three souls and seven bodies like rain. When they had blocked the incoming benches, there was no one left in front of them.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a voice sounded from afar, \u201cDammit, don\u2019t you know how to give a proper order? It should be strategic repositioning! Do you understand? What do you mean by scram? Do you think that we are a gang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The ten individuals from the Yu Family looked at each other pathetically. Apart from their clothes being tattered, every one of them had injuries on them. While their injuries weren\u2019t severe, a few of them could see red.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t make sense!\u201d The ten of them did not understand what was going on. Why did they fight such a strange battle? Furthermore, the other party did not show any signs of losing before disappearing without a trace.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ten of them were completely puzzled. One of them asked, \u201cShould we tell Third Master when he returns?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of letting him know? Talking to a piece of wood is better than talking to him,\u201d another individual replied. After discussing the matter for a long while, they still weren\u2019t able to come to a conclusion. However, all of them felt that this matter was truly a strange one.</p><br/><p>On a street outside the Smoky Thea Tower, more than ten figures were sneakily gathered in a concealed corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about it? Did you guys do it?\u201d someone asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Hehehe, can this be faked?\u201d someone replied delightfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about all of you? Did you miss anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNope, I checked carefully and every one of them was seeing red. This is definitely true!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care whether or not they saw red! I am asking you guys if all of you applied the medicine. Are you sure that not a single one of you are missing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one is missing for sure! From now on, only a single person will be needed to follow them,\u201d all of them replied together.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, the plan today was extremely successful and everything has been arranged appropriately.\u201d In the Ling Family Courtyard\u2019s secret chamber, Ling Jian appeared with a strip of paper.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, very good. Did you investigate the others in the Yu Family\u2019s envoy?\u201d Ling Tian threw a ledger on the desk and asked lazily, \u201cIs there anyone else to take note of? This is an important matter and you must not be careless!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApart from Yu ManTian and the ten top-notch experts, there are 500 members in the envoy party. Adding together the thirty carriage drivers, two doctors, and one flag bearer, there are a total of 544 individuals. Apart from the ten experts, the others definitely wouldn\u2019t have any problems. None of them has profound martial arts and even the flag bearer only has peak purple jade cultivation!\u201d Ling Jian said with confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cMmm, that\u2019s good!\u201d Ling Tian frowned, \u201cDo you understand what to do next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian stood up straight, \u201cThere won\u2019t be a problem! We can carry on as planned! I believe that we will be very successful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian smiled and said, \u201cThen I shall hand everything over to you. I need to go and pacify the fortune deity now. The fortune deity is about to blow her top and she had already thrown the ledger on my table!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe ran out of money? That can\u2019t be right?\u201d Ling Jian was surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnly the head of the household will know how expensive rice is. Our expenditure is truly too large this time.\u201d Ling Tian sighed, \u201cFrom repairing the entire palace to purchasing of the materials to the decorations of the ceremony, we will spend a total of 30,000,000 taels of silver! This doesn\u2019t include the officials and the military\u2019s salary. If we consider our normal expenditure as well, it would be a full 50,000,000 tales of silver! Old Master Ling won\u2019t do anything and is only waiting to sit on that throne. While my dad has returned, he goes drinking with his old subordinates and returns home dead drunk every day. Even if he isn\u2019t drunk, he acts as though he is! Besides, even if he has the heart to help, I wouldn\u2019t dare to allow him to touch something that requires meticulous effort. Everything is naturally being directed to the Ling Family Courtyard. Even if this place of mine is a courtyard, there isn\u2019t a treasure gathering pail, money tree or money printer! Haiz, why is my life so miserable?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian stood up straight and wondered to himself without saying a thing. While the treasure gathering pail and money tree can be related to money, what is this money printer? Is it even more amazing than the previous two?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, it would be rare for us to even spend 10,000 taels of silver and even 100,000 would be considered extravagant. As for anything in the millions, it would be practically non-existent! But now, we are actually spending in the tens of millions! Ah\u2019Jian, do you think that this is extremely frightening? May the heavens rain down gold coins!\u201d Ling Tian lamented.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s face remained cold as though he was listening to his young noble\u2019s rant. However, the corner of his gaze was looking towards the door and the frosty figure of his \u2018heart demon\u2019 floated in his brain. Who knows why that lass was appearing in his head at this moment. I shall go and see her later. Hehe, yes. I shall do just that.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Jian, managing a courtyard, a family, and an empire are completely different things.\u201d Ling Tian grumbled and ranted about all of his grievances in his heart, \u201cI have not even sat on that seat! The old saying goes: Only the individual on the throne would need to consider about politics! Now, the one on the throne has gone fishing and the other one about to ascend to the throne has gone drinking. As for me who is not even on the throne to have to work my ass off, is there still justice in the world?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s voice paused. Just as he was describing his troubles vividly, he raised his head up and noticed Ling Jian being trapped in his fantasies with a slight smirk on his face\u2026</p><br/><p>If Ling Jian did not say a single word in response and listened silently, it was extremely normal for this expressionless First Pavilion Head. However, to think that there was actually a slight smile on his face. Furthermore, it was extremely gentle and amiable\u2026</p><br/><p>This young noble is extremely frustrated over here and it would be one thing for you to not empathize with me. To think that you are actually daydreaming over here? Fantasizing about your fantasies? What are you thinking about that would give you such a perverted smile?</p><br/><p>Young noble flew into a rage in that instant! His eyes were fixed on Ling Jian as though he wanted to eat Ling Jian up alive. Two words were then forced out of his mouth, \u201cLING JIAN!\u201d His voice sounded like thunder and the entire Ling Family Courtyard shook. Ling Tian was a peerless expert indeed and his inner qi wasn\u2019t ordinary!</p><br/><p>Ling Jian stood up straight as though he was an old monk in seclusion. Apart from the slight smile on his face, his appearance wasn\u2019t any different from before. However, his inner thoughts were a world of difference. He was currently trapped in his endless fantasies and was currently thinking to himself, \u201cIf she wants to talk to me, how should I respond to her? If she wants to kill me, how should I react\u2026\u201d All of a sudden, Ling Tian\u2019s loud roar shook his soul and Ling Jian snapped out of his fantasies. He lifted his head up in a flustered manner only to see Ling Tian glaring at him furiously. With a chill in his voice like the winds which blew out from hell, Ling Tian said slowly, \u201cWhat are you thinking about? Why are you so focused? Do you think that I am right? Does what I say make sense?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErr\u2026 yes yes yes, young noble\u2019s foresight is amazing and your words make plenty of sense. Your plans are extremely detailed and Ling Jian is thoroughly convinced.\u201d Ling Jian burst out in a sweat and tried to reply appropriately.</p><br/><p>\u201cAmazing foresight?! Detailed planning?! You! You are going to anger me to death!\u201d Ling Tian blew up in anger. The moment Ling Tian blew up, it wasn\u2019t something ordinary.</p><br/><p>Peng peng peng\u2026</p><br/><p>Following that, the busy Ling Family Courtyard saw an extremely strange scene. Ling Jian, who everyone feared as though he was the living King of Hades, was now being kicked around like a ball. He rolled along the road and the moment he got up and wanted to escape, a faint figure appeared behind him. With a few kicks and punches, Ling Jian rolled out again like a ball\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Jian used his arms to guard his face and curled himself up like a ball. He was like a small blade of grass being kicked around in a category 5 typhoon.</p><br/><p>The storm was over and Ling Jian who was in the middle of the storm was covered in bruises with his clothes tattered all over. His entire head swelled up like he was the Sakyamuni Buddha.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s anger had not subsided and he grabbed onto Ling Jian, \u201cIn three days time, you had better investigate the plot of the two families. You had better find eighteen beauties like elder sister FuRong! This daddy here will let them take turns to have their go at you! I will make you die from over-exhaustion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian was immediately flustered. While he did not know who elder sister FuRong was, he could guess that she wasn\u2019t a good character. He wanted to cry but no tears could come out, \u201cYoung noble, you said five days yesterday\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYesterday is yesterday! Today is today! It seems like you think that three days is too long. Two days then! Things shall be settled as such!\u201d Ling Tian said fiercely before leaving.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian stood up with a stomach full of regret. Looking around at the crowd watching which included Meng LiGe and FengMo, Ling Jian flew into a rage, \u201cWhat are all of you looking at? What\u2019s there to see?! Is this a good show? Do you want me to re-enact the scene?!\u201d</p><br/><p>If the scene was re-enacted, they would definitely become the parties being kicked around. None of them were fools and immediately escaped in all directions!</p></div>\n</div>"}

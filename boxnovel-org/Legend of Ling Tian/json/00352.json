I may die tomorrow, or I may die next year. I don\u2019t know when my death will come. While outsiders think that my status is one of honor, my status will only add on to Tian\u2019ge\u2019s frustrations! BingYan is extremely useless and can\u2019t aid Tian\u2019ge in either the martial or literary arts. The only reliable thing is the fact that my body is still pure and untainted!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBingYan originally intended to spend this life of mine alone. After I complete my role in the family, I could rest in peace and enter the Yellow Springs without regrets. However, I never expected that the heavens would take pity on me and let me meet Tian\u2019ge.\u201d A tear fell from the corner of her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI originally intended to never marry Tian\u2019ge so that I wouldn\u2019t become a burden in his life. However, I always had that little bit of selfish desire in my heart\u2026 I hoped that when I passed on, the engraving on my tombstone would be that I was Ling Tian\u2019s woman. Just this small wish of mine is enough. Even if we can\u2019t be husband and wife when we are alive, BingYan hopes that I can be the daughter-in-law of the Ling Family in the afterlife. To me, this is also happiness.\u201d Yu BingYan said with her eyes shut and tears streaming down her cheeks.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I become Tian\u2019ge\u2019s first wife and die while young, it would be inevitable for Tian\u2019ge to be labeled as a widower. BingYan isn\u2019t willing to see Tian\u2019ge suffer any form of grievance because of me. So, I hope that both of you elders will agree to my request. If you can\u2019t agree to my request, I would rather die than agree to this marriage!\u201d Yu BingYan knelt down on the floor and leaned on Chu Ting\u2019er.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaiz! You silly lass.\u201d Chu Ting\u2019er let out a long sigh with tears glistening in her eyes, \u201cWhat a pitiful lass, what do you want me to say?\u201d As a lady, how could Chu Ting\u2019er not tell that Yu BingYan\u2019s current actions were evidence that she was deeply in love with Ling Tian! Such a deep love for him, such consideration for him! It was enough to prove that Yu BingYan would do anything for Ling Tian! Furthermore, she definitely wouldn\u2019t hesitate in the slightest.</p><br/><p>Even the usually boorish Yu ManTian let out a depressed sigh and went silent for a long while with a trace of melancholy on his face. Yu BingYan\u2019s illness had always been the biggest worry for the Yu Family!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear girl, please get up quickly,\u201d Chu Ting\u2019er helped Yu BingYan up and used her sleeves to wipe the tears from her cheeks. Then, she hugged Yu BingYan tightly in her embrace and said gently, \u201cTian\u2019ge had already said that he is only going to confirm the marriage proposal but not discuss your title yet. However, he definitely wouldn\u2019t let you down. While we have only made an agreement about the marriage, you are no longer the little princess of the Yu Family but the unwed daughter-in-law of our Ling Family. Even if it is for our Ling Family, you have to stay healthy. Do you understand? I am still waiting to hug a grandson so don\u2019t let me down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yu BingYan\u2019s face immediately turned bright red as she buried her face in Chu Ting\u2019er\u2019s bosom. As though she was in her own mother\u2019s embrace, she felt a sense of warmth and comfort. With her emotions bursting forth, she couldn\u2019t help but cry out, \u201cMother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Chu Ting\u2019er broke out into a wide smile and responded with a chuckle, \u201cChild, don\u2019t be afraid. If Tian\u2019er dares to bully you in future, I will take care of him for sure. The males in our Ling Family are all managed by the ladies!\u201d</p><br/><p>As though he was wiping off the tears from the corner of his eyes, Yu ManTian suddenly burst out into laughter, \u201cWhat was the old saying? A girl really can\u2019t be kept once she is grown up. The token of this proposal is still in my possession and you have already started to call her mother!\u201d Before anyone else could even tease her, her very uncle had already started to tease her!</p><br/><p>As Third Master Yu said that, the originally embarrassed Yu BingYan, Chu Ting\u2019er and Ling Chen all glared at him with fury! Chu Ting\u2019er then said slowly, \u201cIn-law, Yan\u2019er is now a member of my Ling Family and while you are Yan\u2019er\u2019s uncle, it is best to watch your language in future, lest we end up being a joke in front of others. Thankfully there aren\u2019t any outsiders here, otherwise we would definitely be looked down upon by them.\u201d</p><br/><p>As Yu ManTian heard that, he was completely dumbfounded. A moment ago, Yu BingYan was still crying her eyes out and after exchanging their tokens of this proposal Yu BingYan had already turned into someone from the Ling Family. Especially Chu Ting\u2019er\u2019s words, in order to ensure that Third Master Yu understood her, she purposefully used simple words and even said it with a solemn tone!</p><br/><p>Yu ManTian looked at the three furious ladies in front of him and couldn\u2019t help but raise his hands in surrender. After letting out an awkward cough, he realized that he didn\u2019t know what to say and could only retreat in defeat.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d A wave of laughter broke out behind him.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian didn\u2019t say anything from the start to the end. Facing Yu BingYan\u2019s deep love for him, Ling Tian suddenly felt that regardless of what he said, he would still feel powerless in this situation! At the same time, he was extremely moved in his heart! He couldn\u2019t help but clench his fists as he swore in his heart, Yan\u2019er, rest assured! I will definitely cure your illness! I, Ling Tian, will never allow you to go into the afterlife to wait for me alone! We have yet to become a celestial pair of lovers whom everyone is envious of!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cChen\u2019er, is there any news from the north yet?\u201d Seeing Yu BingYan escape and Chu Ting\u2019er leaving with a satisfied smile, Ling Tian asked Ling Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. This matter is extremely fishy and difficult to grasp.\u201d Ling Chen said with furrowed brows, \u201cCan it be that our intelligence network in the north is broken? If not, this matter can\u2019t be explained!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian paced around unhurriedly as he said, \u201cPerhaps there may be something else fishy about this matter. Order Ling Six to question the north about this!\u201d Ling Chen acknowledged Ling Tian\u2019s orders and before she could take a step forward, the cry of a falcon sounded and a black dot could be seen approaching them. The next moment, a falcon perched itself on Ling Chen\u2019s shoulders and began lovingly pecking on her cheeks.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen let out a smile and undid a small bamboo container by its feet. There was a ball of paper within it and Ling Chen said with a smile, \u201cIt is news from the north.\u201d Ling Tian then responded with an \u2018oh\u2019.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Ling Chen who was opening the piece of paper started to sway as her face turned completely pale! She read the slip of paper twice to ensure that she didn\u2019t misread it and her hands began to tremble as the slip of paper landed on the floor.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian immediately knew that something was wrong. With a wave of his hands, a wave of inner qi was sent out and the slip of paper floated into his hands like there was a string attached to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWei ChengPing used the Martial Order Medallion to kill young noble. Make swift preparations! Urgent!\u201d These were the only words written on the slip of paper and the words were extremely untidy. It was obvious just how anxious the person writing this message was!</p><br/><p>\u201cMartial Order Medallion! Beyond Heavens!\u201d Ling Tian let out a smile as he raised his head up. With a twitch of his eyebrows, two azure dragons seemed to have shot out of his eyes, \u201cNo wonder! No wonder the Yu Family would act like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung noble, this\u2026 what should we do? That is the Martial Order Medallion that a life can be traded with!\u201d Ling Chen\u2019s had completely lost her cool and her voice was filled with anxiousness!</p><br/><p>If it was before she knew about the presence of the Martial Order Medallion and Beyond Heavens, it wouldn\u2019t matter too much. But after seeing the frightening influence when Ye QingChen mentioned Beyond Heavens and seeing the mysterious green-robed expert that Ling Tian, Ling Jian, Ling Chi and herself couldn\u2019t even stop, Ling Chen felt her heart turn cold!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had once said that that green-robed elder was very likely to be the one to carry out the requests of the Martial Order Medallion! With the strength displayed by the green-robed elder, he was without a doubt the number one expert in the world today!</p><br/><p>Now, the target of this unparalleled expert was Ling Tian! With Ling Tian\u2019s present martial arts, it was impossible for him to be a match for the green-robed expert! Just what should they do?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian couldn\u2019t help but let out a smile and tapped Ling Chen\u2019s nose lightly, \u201cChen\u2019er, is your young noble not a match for Beyond Heavens in your heart? Can it be that everyone from Beyond Heavens is a tiger? Can they all eat me up alive?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen forced a smile as she said with a depressed tone, \u201cIf everyone from Beyond Heavens were tigers, perhaps Chen\u2019er wouldn\u2019t be so worried. Young noble is without a doubt talented beyond your peers and in Ling Chen\u2019s heart, no one will be able to compare to you. But no matter how talented young noble is, you have only been cultivating for a little over ten years. The energy of a single person is limited after all, and this number one expert of Beyond Heavens would have fifty years worth of cultivation at the very least. Furthermore, he has the unparalleled martial arts manuals of Beyond Heavens and a senior to give him pointers. In comparison, young noble is definitely on the losing end.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she suddenly lifted her head up and looked at Ling Tian, \u201cYoung noble, no matter what, I will walk through this tribulation with you! If young noble can come out victorious, Chen\u2019er won\u2019t be affected. If anything untoward were to happen to young noble, Chen\u2019er will definitely accompany you to the afterlife and you will never be alone!\u201d As Ling Chen said that, she was already resolved to live and die with Ling Tian! Despite the combination of the many experts from back then, they were still unable to defeat the green-robed expert. If there was only Ling Tian himself, how would he possibly deal with the green-robed expert?</p><br/><p>Ling Tian then laughed and said proudly, \u201cChen\u2019er you are looking down far too much on your young noble. In this world, I don\u2019t think that there exists an individual who can take my life! Beyond Heavens? Hahaha\u2026 so what about them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen responded with a smile but her brows were still furrowed with worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I am not wrong, the Yu Family must have known that Wei ChengPing had used the Martial Order Medallion to kill me.\u201d Ling Tian said with a smile. Seeing how Ling Chen was so disturbed about the Martial Order Medallion, he decided to change the topic. \u201cSo, the Yu Family decided to propose a marriage to my Ling Family at such a moment. They want to make use of this opportunity to grasp the strength of my Ling Family in their hands! Indeed, no one thinks that I will be able to escape from Beyond Heavens and even Yu ManLou is no exception! However, BingYan is truly in love with me, and it would be impossible for the Yu Family to seize the authority of the Ling Family through her. According to my estimations, the Yu Family must have other plans! Chen\u2019er, can you make a guess what the plan of the Yu Family is?\u201d Ling Tian asked with a carefree tone.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

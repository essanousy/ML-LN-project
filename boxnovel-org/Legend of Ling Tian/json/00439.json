She knows what I am afraid of the most. However\u2026 even if this is the case, I will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Feng and Ling Yun gathered closer to take a look at the note and after reading it, Ling Feng persuaded, \u201cBrother Jian, I know what your plans are but I think that you should think through it carefully. The Yu Family can\u2019t be compared to the interior of an imperial palace, and even the security of Beyond Heavens probably can\u2019t be compared to the Yu Family! Since sister Chen gave you such a condition, she obviously doesn\u2019t want you to take the risk. If you were to insist on going, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! It is the opposite.\u201d Ling Jian shook his head confidently, \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t want me to go, the message in my hands would be for my swift return. Chen\u2019er also can\u2019t make up her mind right now. She doesn\u2019t want anything to happen to me but isn\u2019t willing to give up such a good opportunity. Thus, she would give me such a condition. On one hand, she is giving me approval but on the other hand, giving me pressure and asking me to be careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian\u2019s gaze then swept past Ling Feng and he said with a smile, \u201cAll of you can also tell but purposefully misinterpreted her meaning right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides, things have already developed to a critical stage. If we can\u2019t be decisive at such a moment, we will only suffer in the future. The Yu Family has continuously revealed an unknown source of strength and no one knows how much more strength they have hidden. While it doesn\u2019t matter now, the battle will definitely begin when young noble returns. At that time, we will be stationed by his side and will no longer be able to bother about these things. However, these hidden strengths of the Yu Family will be a destructive force towards our Ling Family and will definitely be a wild card. We can\u2019t afford such a loss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian said with a solemn expression, \u201cYoung noble always says that we have to look at everything with a pair of strategic eyes and look towards our final goal. Every single step we take is for our final victory! The hidden strength of the Yu Family will definitely be a hindrance to our plans, and we won\u2019t be able to sleep peacefully if we don\u2019t get to the bottom of this! Furthermore, Ye BaiFei was able to retreat fully after attempting to assassinate Yu ManLou, and my present martial arts are far superior to Ye BaiFei\u2019s! Nothing will happen to me for sure! Even the thousand-year-old Yu Family may not be able to keep me from leaving!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, brother Jian must be careful. This little brother will not say anything else.\u201d Knowing that it was impossible for him to persuade Ling Jian, Ling Feng let out a sigh and left.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if it is the Yu Family. Even if I have to enter the dragon\u2019s nest or tiger\u2019s lair, would I, Ling Jian, be trapped?\u201d Ling Jian let out a chilly smile, \u201cIf I don\u2019t go, do I expect young noble to take action personally? Is young noble feeding us for nothing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt night, the six of us will be your lookout, and we must fully investigate the Yu Family! We just don\u2019t have to tell sister Chen!\u201d Ling Yun proclaimed. As Ling Yun said that, the five others brimmed with battle intent as they looked at Ling Jian.</p><br/><p>\u201cDefinitely not!\u201d Ling Jian rejected, \u201cLass Chen had said clearly that none of you are to go! Are all of you going to defy her orders? Do you know why she would give such an order?\u201d Ling Jian\u2019s cold gaze swept past the six of them, \u201cIt is because all of you are still unable to aid me! Even if the Yu Family can\u2019t keep me from leaving, the Yu Family may be able to keep the rest of you! You have to remember, when young noble isn\u2019t around, Lass Chen\u2019s words are equivalent to young noble\u2019s words! I don\u2019t want to hear any of you defying her orders! I don\u2019t want such a thing to happen again!\u201d</p><br/><p>The six of them lowered their heads in guilt. Especially Ling Yun, whose face turned completely pale and whose clothes were drenched in sweat.</p><br/><p>\u201cTalking about laying an ambush and assassinations, all of you are undoubtedly top-notch experts! In the field of assassinations, young noble has personally mentored all of you, and all of you are definitely far superior to the assassins in the continent. If the six of you were to catch Yu ManLou off guard, it wouldn\u2019t be impossible to assassinate him!\u201d Ling Jian said coldly, \u201cHowever, when we talk about an upfront battle, the six of you are still greatly lacking! It would be an achievement if the six of you can even beat Yu ManTian. There are far too many capable individuals in the world, and after we return to the Courtyard, all of you will be receiving special training!\u201d</p><br/><p>The six of them lowered their heads and didn\u2019t dare to say anything.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian then turned around and said in a low voice, \u201cI will enter the Yu Family at midnight tonight! If I don\u2019t return in two hours, all of you are to leave immediately and return to Sky Bearing! You must not delay for even a moment! There isn\u2019t a need to bother about my life or death!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Jian!\u201d The six of them lifted their heads up with their eyes turning red!</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mind is set. There isn\u2019t a need for words!\u201d Ling Jian hollered, \u201cDid all of you hear what I said?! Are all of you going to defy orders again?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The six of their eyes were reddened and fixed on Ling Jian but none of them said a word.</p><br/><p>Ling Jian said coldly, \u201cIf I don\u2019t return, this will be my final order. Are all of you going to defy it?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Feng took a step forward and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cRest assured brother Jian, us brothers will definitely obey your orders. Brother Jian is blessed by the heavens and will definitely return victorious!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlessed by the heavens?\u201d Ling Jian said with an odd smile, \u201cEver since I was nine, my hands were stained with blood. I became the Pavilion Head of the First Pavilion and held the lives of others in my hands for a full six years! In the past six years, more than a thousand individuals have died under my sword! Young noble had once said, \u2018killing one is a crime, killing ten thousand is a hero and killing a million makes one a hero amongst heroes\u2019! I have lived my life according to that code and I have no regrets!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian let out a maniacal laugh and his black figure disappeared from the hut leaving a sentence behind, \u201cIf any of you dare to follow me secretly, I will kill you personally! I will not permit my subordinates to defy my orders!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the sky was about to turn dark, a man and woman walked into Bright Jade City. Their ages weren\u2019t too old but upon close inspection, they looked extremely mature as though they had been through lots of hardships. Especially the young man, his skin tone was extremely dark as though it was a piece of charcoal. On top of that, his appearance was a sight too ugly to witness, with a pair of triangular eyes and his messy hair drooping down covering half his face.</p><br/><p>From head to toe, the only slightly more pleasant thing about this young man would probably be his figure.</p><br/><p>The figure of the woman wasn\u2019t too bad. If one were to look at her from the back, he would definitely have the urge to commit a crime. But if one were to look at her from the front, he would probably have the need to defend himself. Apart from her tan skin tone, her face was yellowish and skinny as though she had been deprived of a good meal for a few years. Furthermore, her face was covered with pimples with pus oozing out from some of them. Both the man and woman were dressed in ordinary coarse cloth which had been washed repeatedly to the point that it was turning white. In some places, there were even patches of cloth stitched on to mend their clothes.</p><br/><p>A pair of poor broke people! A pair of poor broke people without a single cent on them! The guards by the city gates couldn\u2019t even be bothered to question them as they let out a sneer and quickly waved them in, lest the two individuals stay at the city gates for too long and smear them with bad luck. They didn\u2019t even have the mood to search these two individuals and elicit bribes. After all, could a pair of poor people like the two of them possibly produce anything of value?</p><br/><p>By the side, a few purple-dressed characters studied the two of them carefully. While the purple-dressed characters didn\u2019t find anything wrong about them, they could vaguely feel that something was amiss. They could feel a strong sense of danger\u2026 Could they be enemies?!</p><br/><p>The man and woman walked into the city under the gazes of everyone as they chatted merrily with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, this city is huge! It\u2019s so beautiful! There are so many people!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. This is your first time in the city, and everything is naturally extremely fresh to you. Your big brother is someone who has seen the world before and a city like this can be considered not too bad. Little lass, you must perform well when we see uncle later. Maybe uncle can find a good family for you to marry. Like the Yu Family that everyone talks about, it definitely wouldn\u2019t be a bad choice. You should definitely consider them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEn en en, that\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Big brother, if I can become the young miss of the Yu Family, I will definitely make sure that you can have a fresh bowl of porridge every day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, it would be my fortune if that\u2019s the case. My dear sister, you have to remember that I want two bowls of porridge at that time. We can also put on airs to anger that Er Gou. I can rely on my little sister\u2019s fortune to disgust all of my brothers.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheh! The both of them have become crazy from being poor! They truly know how to dream, thinking of being the young miss of the Yu Family! With the way she looks, even if someone paid me money to take her as a maid, I wouldn\u2019t want to take her in.\u201d The guards by the city gates began cursing with disdain.</p><br/><p>A mistake. It must definitely be a misperception. How could the both of them give me such a dangerous feeling? It seems that we are overly worried thanks to that darn Ling Tian. Why isn\u2019t he dead yet?!</p><br/><p>By the side, the doubt in the few Yu Family\u2019s experts also disappeared as they focused their attention on the others entering the city. Very quickly, the pair of poor siblings were forgotten.</p><br/><p>There were just far too many people in the world who had such unrealistic dreams and there wasn\u2019t a need to make a big fuss out of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Yu Family has tightened the security indeed. Thankfully we changed our appearance meticulously, otherwise we may not have been able to enter the city.\u201d The poor little sister stuck out her tongue and said mischievously.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when did this young noble make a mistake?\u201d The triangular eyes brother said proudly, \u201cFurthermore, we have just killed sixteen assassins near Bright Jade City and even intentionally sent people back to spread the news. If Yu ManLou does not put up his guard, wouldn\u2019t he be thinking less of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 irritating!\u201d That little sister stomped her feet and wanted to pinch her older brother in the waist, \u201cHowever, isn\u2019t your clothing a little too exaggerated? How ugly! It doesn\u2019t matter if you want to doll yourself up like a clown. Why do you have to force me to do so also?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, alright, you still dare to push the blame to me? How unreasonable! My appearance was all a result of your makeover, and you dare to say that I am ugly? Furthermore, since when did I force you to disguise yourself as such? You obviously performed the makeover yourself!\u201d That older brother said helplessly, \u201cI am innocent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, who asked you to force me to become your younger sister? With such a horrendous looking brother like you, how can I as the sister be any much better?! How dare you say that you didn\u2019t force it upon me?!\u201d That young lady kicked a pebble on the ground angrily.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

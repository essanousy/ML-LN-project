This demoness had far too many tricks up her sleeves and they were all too brutal! This was the first time that Ling Jian was able to find someone with comparable means to his young noble! In fact, she even exceeded his young noble in certain areas. She was just too frightening and even the \u2018cool\u2019 Ling Jian was pranked by Li Xue to the point he almost wanted to cry!</p><br/><p>There was one time where he refused to drink the medicine because Li Xue pranked him by adding an additional ingredient into his medicine: Chinese goldthread. The feeling when drinking it is one worst than death! At that time, Ling Jian would rather die than drink it but Li Xue used a single trick to force Ling Jian to drink it obediently. Furthermore, after drinking the medicine, he even had to praise it for being extremely delicious!</p><br/><p>Miss Li brewed two bowls of medicine. She added Chinese goldthread in one and for the other bowl, she added a few live earthworms and small young snakes. She even dug out some residue from a horse\u2019s mouth and put it into the medicine\u2026 She then forced Ling Jian to make a choice between the bowls of medicine while pinching this First Pavilion Head\u2019s nose.</p><br/><p>As such, Ling Jian had no choice but to submit.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that Ling Jian didn\u2019t want to retaliate, but the fact that Li Xue was pretty strong. It was impossible for the injured Ling Jian to be a match for her! However, could Ling Jian possibly be a match for her even if he was fully recovered? Ling Jian didn\u2019t have much confidence in that either!</p><br/><p>Since he didn\u2019t have the heart and strength, he could only make the wise choice to submit! So what if he was the First Pavilion Head? Wasn\u2019t he a human too? When it was time for him to submit, he would still have to submit\u2026 a good man will not fight a lady! Ling Jian could only console himself with those words.</p><br/><p>Currently, every time Ling Jian saw Li Xue\u2019s figure, he would subconsciously shiver as though he had just seen a ghost in broad daylight. He was never that frightened even when seeing Ling Tian! Hearing the other party calling him \u2018Little Jian Jian\u2019, he could not help but snort and glare at Li Xue with overwhelming killing intent, \u201cDo not provoke me again! If not, I will be unable to control myself from killing you when my injuries are better!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill me?\u201d Li Xue seemed to have heard a huge joke and began laughing hysterically, \u201cHahahaha, I am really afraid! Please don\u2019t kill me alright, I am only a weak lady!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Jian grunted angrily and turned his head around. At the same time, he came to a conclusion in his heart: Regardless of who this \u2018weak lady\u2019 was to their young noble and whether or not she will become his young noble\u2019s lady, he must definitely beat her into submission once after his injuries were better to vent his anger! In this period of time, this number one assassin in the world had almost cried from her tortures\u2026</p><br/><p>Poor Ling Jian! Up until now, he did not understand the depths of this demoness\u2019s martial arts. She was an expert who was just as perverse as his young noble! However, it wouldn\u2019t be too long before he truly smashed his head until his skull cracked. At this very moment, Ling Jian was already moving in that direction\u2026 earnestly and excitedly\u2026 poor child!</p><br/><p>Li Xue chuckled and looked at the dumbstruck Ling Chi by the side, \u201cLittle Jian Jian, I will let you know that a weak lady cannot be bullied either.\u201d She then turned around and walked towards the secret chamber of the Courtyard.</p><br/><p>Ever since she arrived, Li Xue had hid in the secret chamber to digest all of Ling Tian\u2019s plans and forces. Almost every day, she would be greeted by something shocking and after a few days, Li Xue was already numb to this feeling of shock!</p><br/><p>She never imagined that Ling Tian would be able to create such a huge force single-handedly with little to no foundation! The breadth and variety of his forces, as well as the depths of his plans, had awed Li Xue completely!</p><br/><p>Li Xue was certain that if she were to activate all of the forces that she had come into contact with so far, the direction of the winds would definitely change! The strength of Ling Tian\u2019s forces was more than sufficient to wipe out any small empire in the Heavenly Star Continent!</p><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>Just how did Ling Tian accomplish this?</p><br/><p>How did he accomplish this in less than twenty years?</p><br/><p>If Li Xue was in Ling Tian\u2019s shoes, while it wouldn\u2019t be easy for her to accomplish such feats, it wasn\u2019t impossible either. However, the most challenging part was the fact that Ling Tian had to act like a profligate son while secretly developing a force capable of rivaling an empire! This was unimaginable! Furthermore, he did it in such a short period of time. Just what kind of intelligence does he need to accomplish this? Li Xue was completely baffled. Besides that, Ling Tian was still able to achieve such heights in his martial arts despite expending so much effort to build up his forces!</p><br/><p>If she was Ling Tian, even if she could split herself into two and had twice the amount of effort to spend, she would still not be able to accomplish such a feat. She could not help but lament to herself, Even though we are both transmigrators, why is the difference between us so huge? Could it be that I am truly incomparable to him? Has the gap between us widened even further in this world?</p><br/><p>After understanding all of these, Li Xue chose to adopt the same method of control without a trace of hesitation: To control everything in the dark. She would definitely not replace Ling Chen\u2019s current position and even if she wanted to replace Ling Chen, no one, including Ling Tian, would agree to that. Ling Chen was after all the lady who had followed Ling Tian for the longest period of time. Her status was deeply rooted and there was no one capable of shaking it! This was something that Li Xue could strongly feel ever since she entered the Courtyard!</p><br/><p>At the same time, it was also because Li Xue truly understood Ling Tian\u2019s intentions. That was for her to become Ling Tian\u2019s trump card before the situation in the world was set. Ling Tian had already revealed his own strength, and he needed someone to keep watch in the dark. Li Xue was undoubtedly the best choice!</p><br/><p>Thus, Li Xue decided her own position. She wouldn\u2019t fight with anyone over anything but stand behind Ling Tian and help watch over his family. It was enough for her to just keep herself, the final and strongest trump card, hidden. At the very most, she would give Ling Tian some suggestions or provide some aid to Ling Tian when he was too busy and unable to handle matters. However, the world would only see that there are three people ruling over the Courtyard: Ling Tian, Ling Chen and Ling Jian. There would never be a Li Xue!</p><br/><p>Thus, Li Xue acted in an extremely low-profile manner and even the upper echelons of the Courtyard did not know of her existence or had only seen her once. They did not know what her background or purpose was, and she had disappeared into the Courtyard as though she had never appeared before.</p><br/><p>If Ling Tian was to know about Li Xue\u2019s actions, he would definitely clap his hands in praise!</p><br/><p>Three days later.</p><br/><p>Dawn.</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou entered the Ling Family Courtyard with a face full of worry requesting to see Ling Chen.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey will arrive in Sky Bearing at noon,\u201d Shui QianRou said worriedly, \u201cI will have to welcome them at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen raised her head up with a smile that didn\u2019t seem like a smile, \u201cOh? Why is second sister so worried because of a few men? Relax, there is nothing that impossible in the world and if younger sister doesn\u2019t adjust her mental state, it will be even more difficult for you to face those unwanted guests.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shui QianRou nodded her head in gratitude.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen suddenly asked, \u201cHow about\u2026 I follow you to welcome them? If you go alone, will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She immediately understood what Ling Chen was worried about, and Shui QianRou forced a smile, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I am a lady after all and they do not consider me to be their competition. Thus, they will not do anything to me. Even if they will fight their own brothers, they will not touch a lady like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>A sharp glare shone in Ling Chen\u2019s eyes and she began to chuckle, \u201cLittle sister\u2019s words make sense, maybe I was thinking too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is only because you care for my safety. Am I not the same as well?\u201d Shui QianRou said with gratitude, \u201cAfter they arrive, while they will not do anything to me, my brother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Chen smiled, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will let Ling Chi bring a few men at that time. Even if we are only in a temporary alliance, they will still have to give us some face in the Heavenly Star Continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you elder sister for your kindness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Shui QianRou leaving hastily, Ling Chen\u2019s eyes were filled with a profound gaze, Are all of you finally here? We can wait no longer.</p><br/><p>Thinking about what Shui QianRou said previously, Ling Chen let out a sneer. So what if you are a lady? Will you really not pose any competition in the Shui Family? Will you have no hope to inherit the Shui Family? If all of the direct descendants in the younger generation die, what would happen?</p><br/><p>Ever since Ling Tian left, Ling Chen had racked her brains for the Ling Family Courtyard and target in her heart. Every step she took and every word she spoke was calculated carefully and she would think through things repeatedly to prevent herself from missing anything. Under such circumstances, Ling Chen\u2019s improvement was undeniably huge. In just a short three months, Ling Chen had grown from being a lass by Ling Tian\u2019s side to an eligible leader.</p><br/><p>However, such a life was something that Ling Chen did not like. In fact, she was rather tired of such a life. The thing which she wanted to do most was to stand behind her beloved man silently and share with him his joy and sorrows.</p><br/><p>Regardless if it was the authority of the heavens or the allure of riches, it was incomparable to standing behind her young noble and being a lass who didn\u2019t need to bother about anything. That was the most fortunate and blessed lifestyle. Ling Chen looked towards the horizon with cloudy eyes, Young noble, I am thinking of you. Ling Chen is thinking of you. Are you fine?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He belonged to the side branch of the Ling Family in his previous life after all and he did not understand the different taboos of the Divine Ice Formula. If Ling Chen could not conceive because of the Divine Ice Formula, it could be imagined how big a blow it would be to her. Thankfully, there was still hope for her and it wouldn\u2019t take too long for the problem to be solved.</p><br/><p>He immediately came to a decision in his heart. After finding out which herbs were useful to their condition from Li Xue, he would immediately issue an imperial decree to collect all of these herbs in bulk. Even if the two ladies had to consume these spirit herbs every day, he would ensure that their cultivation would rise rapidly. This shouldn\u2019t be a difficult matter for him at all.</p><br/><p>Two years? How can I possibly wait for such a long time? I will make sure that you two are well in a year or less.</p><br/><p>The most important thing would be for him to have a son. With a son, he wouldn\u2019t have to be afraid that there wasn\u2019t anyone to pass down the throne to.</p><br/><p>Li Xue smiled slightly and changed the topic. \u201cAccording to the news, Xiao FengYang\u2019s troops are about forty miles away from us. Their movement is extremely slow as though they are waiting for something.\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, Li Xue already had her own plans with regard to giving birth to a child. This was also the reason why she wasn\u2019t willing to do that together with Ling Tian. While she was completely capable of resolving this matter in secret, her character would not allow her to do so. As a woman of the current generation, Li Xue would ensure that her good deeds were known by the people around her. Especially if the person was her beloved man.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, she had wounded Ling Tian in their previous life far too deeply. While they were in a completely different world and all of their grievances had been sorted out, Li Xue did not wish for Ling Tian to think about those matters from time to time. She could not bear to lose Ling Tian again. Thus, she had to slowly solidify her position in Ling Tian\u2019s heart. She did not wish to be the only one in his heart but only wished to be irreplaceable!</p><br/><p>I am not going to fight for the position by your side, even if no one will be able to stop me. I will not fight or compete with the other ladies. However, I will fight for the position in your heart. Even if you have ten thousand ladies by your side, I must have a position in the most tender portion of your heart that belongs solely to me.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao FengYang\u2026, he is probably waiting for me.\u201d Ling Tian raised his brows and smiled, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, we should speed up slightly. Things would be bad if my dad\u2019s messenger envoy catches up to us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue looked at Ling Tian with a smile which didn\u2019t seem like a smile, \u201cWhat\u2019s so scary about being the monarch of an empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNonsense!\u201d Ling Tian rolled his eyes, \u201cI would understand if it is someone else asking me this question. That position is definitely frightening! How will I be able to endure those kinds of restrictions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed so. The person who understands you the most in this world is I, Li Xue!\u201d Li Xue nodded her head in agreement. \u201cYou are like a wolf in the mountains and your biggest joy is to roam unhindered in the forest and do as you wish. Asking you to remain in the imperial palace and face the endless mountain of memorials is truly too torturous for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s face was full of black lines. While those words of hers seemed to sound nice, why did they sound so strange at the same time?</p><br/><p>Ling Chen by the side burst out giggling. Ling Chen also did not know why but every time these two met each other, they would not coexist peacefully! They would always end up bickering and would even exchange blows at times. After exchanging blows, everything would go back to normal.</p><br/><p>There had never been an exception. It seems like this time wasn\u2019t any different.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I am a wolf in the mountains, what are you?\u201d Indeed, Ling Tian began mocking, \u201cThe female wolf in the mountains? A wolf beauty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everything developed as Ling Chen had predicted and she took a few steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow bold! You dare to scold me right after I helped you?\u201d Li Xue\u2019s brows furrowed and her eyes glowed with coldness.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were the one who scolded me first!\u201d Ling Tian retaliated, \u201cA little lady like you dares to scold your husband. Are you seeking a beating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDivine Ice Formula!\u201d Li Xue\u2019s eyes turned red and she summoned a wave of cold air with a flick of her sleeves.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I am afraid of you?!\u201d Ling Tian snorted and fought back. Ling Chen was baffled. This was the second time they had fought along the way. These two fellows were truly loggerheads.</p><br/><p>However, what Ling Chen didn\u2019t know was that both Ling Tian and Li Xue were using these blows to vent out something. If not, how would it be possible for the two of them to exchange blows so easily with their cultivation?</p><br/><p>A long while later. \u201cYou only know how to bully women! What a shameless man.\u201d Li Xue wasn\u2019t a match and she escaped. While they were trying to vent something, Ling Tian would definitely not let go of her. While Ling Tian wouldn\u2019t do much to her, she definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to escape being spanked on the ass.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to run? Do you think you will be able to escape?\u201d Ling Tian chuckled and gave chase.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen shook her head and could only follow behind them. At the same time, she pondered to herself if she should stop them if they fought next time. After all, she couldn\u2019t possibly allow them to fight all the time.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang rode on the horse and proceeded forward at a slow pace with a calm expression on his face. However, an observant individual would be able to tell that both worry and relief could be seen on his face.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t a chance for his family to turn back!</p><br/><p>After the six corpses from Above Heavens were found, Xiao FengYang knew that nothing would turn the situation around!</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Ling Tian had chosen to take action and he would definitely aid the Xiao Family in escaping from the grasp of Above Heavens. However, the glorious days of them ruling over the south-east would also be gone. From now on, they would only be the subordinates of the Divine Prefecture Empire.</p><br/><p>Was this a good or bad thing for the Xiao Family?</p><br/><p>They no longer needed to be puppets and could lead a carefree life. However, the thousand-year foundation of their family would be completely wiped out!</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang let out a long sigh. Regardless of whether it was a good or bad thing, turning back now would only destroy their Xiao Family completely! Both Above Heavens and the Ling Family wouldn\u2019t let them off if they turned back now! Both parties were not figures that their Xiao Family could deal with and the difference between the two families was that one was strong, the other stronger!</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang originally thought that he would need to spend a great deal of effort to persuade Old Master Ling but never expected matters to go so smoothly. While this was because of the brotherly ties between Old Master Ling and Xiao FengHan, it was difficult to say how much of their brotherly ties were left. At the very least, Xiao FengYang did not believe that there would be anyone in the world who would treat brotherly ties with such importance! Even if there were such brotherly ties in the world, Xiao FengYang did not believe that it would appear in the imperial family!</p><br/><p>Currently, the Ling Family was already an imperial family and the sword brother of his big brother was the founding emperor of the Divine Prefecture Empire!</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang could clearly feel that the only reason behind for the Ling Family believing them so easily was largely due to Xiao YanXue. Because Xiao YanXue was a lady who had received Ling Tian\u2019s acknowledgment, Ling Tian would not be willing to put Xiao YanXue in a spot or hurt her. Thus, their Xiao Family had this opportunity that Xiao FengYang believed was almost impossible to grasp!</p><br/><p>While Above Heavens had already lost quite a bit of their forces in the previous clashes with Ling Tian, those that remained were the absolute elites. Any family in the world today would have to be cautious in the face of these forces and even the Yu Family wasn\u2019t an exception!</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian had agreed without hesitation and had even made a promise!</p><br/><p>Thinking about their family\u2019s attitude towards Ling Tian and Xiao YanXue, Xiao FengYang let out a long sigh. Did he feel guilt or regret? Who would have thought that the granddaughter who the entire family had decided to sacrifice would save the family when they were at their wits end?!</p><br/><p>The soft breeze could be heard and three individuals appeared. Ling Tian, Ling Chen and Li Xue.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang hurriedly got off his horse, \u201cFor Crown Prince your highness to come personally, this old man is truly overwhelmed with favor. This old man greets Crown Prince your highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>News of Ling Zhan passing down the throne to Ling Xiao had already spread and Xiao FengYang was naturally aware of it. He also knew that Ling Tian had also risen from imperial grandson to crown prince. However, what Xiao FengYang didn\u2019t know was that Ling Xiao\u2019s imperial decree was probably on the way as well.</p><br/><p>At that time, this young noble Ling who was the imperial grandson three days ago and crown prince today would probably become the yellow-robed emperor.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Master Xiao does not need to be so courteous.\u201d Ling Tian smiled and turned his face to the side. It couldn\u2019t be helped, one of the crown prince\u2019s consorts had just given the crown prince a good punch to the face and his cheek was still swollen. It wouldn\u2019t be good for the crown prince of an empire to be seen in such a pathetic state after all. Even if Ling Tian wasn\u2019t bothered about his face, he still had to bother about the face of his Divine Prefecture Empire\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang immediately gave the order for his troops to set up camp on the spot and sent out his men on patrol. He then invited Ling Tian into the tent. For Ling Tian to appear at this moment, it definitely meant that he had something to discuss with him. They couldn\u2019t possibly talk while riding their horses after all.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Master Xiao, I have made a promise to deal with the matters of the Xiao Family and so I am here to ask about Meng FanYun from Above Heavens. Also, if Second Master has any information about the other elders of Above Heavens, I hope that Second Master will let me know as well.\u201d Ling Tian said with a smile and sat down on a comfortable chair with Ling Chen and Li Xue by his side.</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang\u2019s eyes glowed and looked at the position of the two ladies with a knowing gaze.</p><br/><p>Ling Chen sat on Ling Tian\u2019s left extremely naturally as though it was an extremely habitual action. While this lady was a maid at birth, she grew up together with Ling Tian and had probably sat at Ling Tian\u2019s left side since they were young.</p><br/><p>Why had Ling Tian made such an arrangement? It was extremely obvious!</p><br/><p>The position of the crown prince\u2019s consort had already been decided! Her position as empress was also one that couldn\u2019t be shaken! Even if she was a maid before, everything was possible as long as Ling Tian was willing!</p><br/><p>Xiao FengYang let out a long sigh and completely gave up on the idea of Xiao YanXue becoming the empress in future.</p></div>\n</div>"}

She would rather die than to suffer such humiliation.</p><br/><p>However, she suddenly felt something wet on her face, as though it suddenly started to rain. Furthermore, there was sort of a salty smell to it, making her feel extremely confused. Wasn\u2019t it still shining brightly just now? It was only after the two disgusting hands that were holding onto her robes fell off, followed by screams of pain, that she opened her eyes in shock.</p><br/><p>A masked person in gray had rushed over like a whirlwind, and it was not known when the guard\u2019s hands that were grabbing her were suddenly separated from his body. The guard in question was shouting himself hoarse from misery. His current tragic appearance made some people feel much better!</p><br/><p>Ling Tian\u2019s gaze was cold, his moves decisive and ruthless. He brandished the blade in his hand, and with the flash of steel, five of them were already on the ground. It was as though he was chopping vegetables, with movements so quick that it occurred even before the scream came out from the mouth of the guard with severed hands!</p><br/><p>The rest of the guards brandished their blades in return and rushed towards Ling Tian. The latter only snorted as his figure quickly rushed forwards. There was a dull gleam and Ling Tian slowly breezed back. However, instead of continuing their chase, the ten odd guards stupidly stood at their original spot, every one of their faces gradually turning ash-grey\u2026</p><br/><p>Bringing his blade down, the rest of the ropes binding the lady quickly fell on the ground. Ling Tian then flicked his wrist, sending the short sword in his hand out like a boomerang.</p><br/><p>In an alley, a fortunate guard was hurriedly escaping for his life. Just as he was about to turn the corner, and his heart unconsciously relaxed a little, he felt an acute danger behind. Turning around, he happened to see the steel blade shoot towards his chest, clearly noting how it pierced through his chest to embed itself in the wall behind him, still trembling from the force. After that, his world became black\u2026</p><br/><p>Putong! Those guards who were originally frozen in their positions started falling down one by one. Before they hit the ground, all their heads split apart like watermelons\u2026</p><br/><p>Just now, when Ling Tian rushed forwards to meet them, he had beheaded all of them with one slash. However, due to his speed, they died before their heads could even leave the body, creating a scenario where they were frozen for a second in their positions much like being attacked by a fiend\u2026</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this scene, the guard with severed hands immediately started trembling, and despite opening his mouth, no sound could come out. It was only after rapidly blinking that he suddenly kneeled down on the floor, tears and mucus flowing out as he screamed loudly, \u201cSpare me, hero! This little one deserves death, I\u2026 I won\u2019t dare to do this anymore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian sneered, he was not interested at all in his nonsense. His foot viciously struck out, perfectly hitting the sensitive spot of the guard. A dull cracking sound could be heard, as though two eggs had been shattered\u2026 That guard did a backflip from the impact of Ling Tian\u2019s kick, and his eyes rolled back as he opened his mouth wide. But he dared not utter a sound, merely hyperventilating as his facial features scrunched up so hard they seemed to meld together. In an instant, his shirt was wet with cold sweat.</p><br/><p>Glancing at the lady who stood by the side and was still in a daze, Ling Tian twisted his lips, \u201cHey, do you want to personally kill him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The lady in question blinked before coming back into reality. Her blackened face flushed with a red of embarrassment, and she suddenly picked up a blade as though possessed, viciously slashing down on the guard\u2019s head. The guard only had time to stammer a \u2018spare me\u2019 before his head too burst open, spilling all over the floor and creating a stench.</p><br/><p>Throwing the blade to the side, the lady trembled, taking a while before she recovered. As she turned back to face Ling Tian, she bowed, \u201cMany thanks to Sir for saving my life. This favor of protecting my chastity and reputation is not one that I will forget as long as I live. Dare I ask for your esteemed name, in hopes that I can repay your favor some day?!\u201d While she had just narrowly escaped, she was actually able to restore her elegant demeanor, unlike normal ladies who would look as though their souls had been taken away.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian had a teasing light in his eyes as he lightly laughed, \u201cMiss Xiao, it looks like life is full of coincidences. Why is it that every time I see you, it has to be you being involved in some disastrous scene? The last time was so, this time too! Looks like I\u2019m really your lucky star!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d The lady got a rude shock, staring with wide eyes at Ling Tian, before suddenly shrilling, \u201cYou\u2019re\u2026 Ling Tian?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s indeed this insignificant one, for Miss Xiao to remember the number one profligate 1 of Sky Bearing, I am truly honored.\u201d Ling Tian laughed in response, \u201cHowever, Miss Xiao is the precious princess of the Xiao Family, so why would you be alone here in the Yu Family\u2019s territory? If not for this puzzling fact, I would have narrowly missed this incident.\u201d</p><br/><p>This lady actually turned out to be Xiao YanXue, who ran away from home! It was just that her reason for turning up here was unknown. Ling Tian clearly stated that if not for the fact that he recognized her voice, he would not even bother to step in and settle this affair. He only decided that he had to save her after hearing her scream!</p><br/><p>No matter the case, the Xiao and Ling Family had almost become in-laws once. Regardless of how heartless and cruel Ling Tian might have been, upon meeting such an incident, he was unable to stare heartlessly as someone he knew was violated, let alone someone like Xiao YanXue!</p><br/><p>Out of Ling Tian\u2019s expectations, the moment Xiao YanXue realized he was Ling Tian, she froze dumbly on the spot, and her eyes started to water. Tears dripped down like a pearl necklace being broken, and she suddenly threw herself on Ling Tian, holding on to him with all her strength and bawling out loud. As she cried, her tiny fists constantly pounded on his back as she cried out, \u201cWuwuwu\u2026 it\u2019s you\u2026 it\u2019s really you\u2026 you darned b*st*rd\u2026 wuwuwu\u2026 it was so hard for me to find you, wuwu\u2026 why did you only come now, did you know, just now\u2026 wuwuwu\u2026\u201d Under the release of all her suppressed emotions, YanXue cried nonstop for a while, before suddenly fainting and collapsing onto Ling Tian\u2019s chest\u2026</p><br/><p>Ling Tian was left carrying a soft burden with a good smell and a brain full of fog. Why had the little princess of the Xiao Family suddenly appeared? Could there have been a problem with the Xiao Family? That did not seem very likely since Above Heavens was still situated inside Bright Jade City, so how could anything happen to the Xiao Family? With their power and influence, even the Yu Family couldn\u2019t do anything to them in a short period of time!</p><br/><p>That being said, even if she was escaping from something, why would she not seek the Above Heavens people for asylum? If she did that, how could she have landed in this state where she got bullied by the patrol guards? Furthermore, hadn\u2019t she always viewed him as a thorn in the eye, why would she suddenly act so friendly towards him all of a sudden? It was as though\u2026 erm, as though she was leaving behind her last will and testament!</p><br/><p>What sort of matter was going on?!</p><br/><p>A good deal of doubts and suspicions were scattered around in disorder. Ling Tian could only clear his head with a shake. This lass had even fainted on his chest now, right where he had killed over a dozen patrol guards. The whole place reeked of blood, and naturally was not a good place to tarry. Besides, the next patrol squad from the Yu Family was approaching, and if they were spotted, it would not be a nice joke. It would be better if they got out first.</p><br/><p>Carrying this soft bundle of pleasant-smelling temptation, Ling Tian could only let out a bitter smile and vault over the wall beside them. If anyone happened to be looking at him, they would just see him vanish as though he was never there. It would not be strange to suspect that oneself was previously looking at a ghost.</p><br/><p>In her dreams, Xiao YanXue felt an unprecedented sense of security that she had not felt in a long while. Ever since she knew that the strongest expert in the world was chasing after him, she never had a good night\u2019s rest. While one could say that she was assured at being saved from disgrace just now, a greater reason for her sense of security was actually because she was able to meet with a completely intact Ling Tian! Not only was he not in danger, but also perfectly safe and sound.</p><br/><p>Her original judgment of herself was unbearably lofty, thinking that she was not only clever and witty, with many schemes, but also managing the family business and increasing the volume of sales day after day. She believed that in the entire Heavenly Star Continent, there was actually no one that could be compared to her!</p><br/><p>However, the last trip to Sky Bearing completely destroyed her worldview. Be it the brain she was so proud of, or wisdom, or even poetry and music which she so loved, there was not a single aspect in which she wasn\u2019t soundly beaten. And the person who beat her in all aspects was the person she had despised since she was young, the number one profligate in Sky Bearing, Ling Tian!</p><br/><p>She had never believed any other lady capable enough to meet her talents, but with the appearance of Ling Chen, Xiao YanXue had already lost confidence in herself. Towards the talents of Ling Chen, she only had praise! However, this outstanding Ling Chen was merely the maidservant of Ling Tian, with her every single aspect being carefully groomed by Ling Tian himself! At that point, Xiao YanXue did not dare to believe, did not want to believe, and could not bring herself to believe it! How could the number one profligate actually have the ability to teach someone, let alone someone as outstanding as Ling Chen?</p><br/><p>Following that was the literary meet, where Ling Tian used his peerless literary talent to move her heart. How could she still refuse to believe? The truth was in front of her!</p><br/><p>In front of him, everything that she was proud of about herself was unworthy to even be mentioned! The most embarrassing part, however, was that she had maintained that sort of haughty and proud demeanor to look down on him. But that day, at her most helpless, he was the one who had saved her. Ever since she found out that Ling Tian was her savior, she had always felt some shame when facing him.</p><br/><p>To give an example, it was as though a person who failed the official exams was bragging about himself in front of someone else, and even using a tone that signified the other was trash. Then the former finds out that the person that he was bragging to was actually the top scholar! But words spoken could not be taken back. This sort of embarrassment was indescribable.</p><br/><p>From the disdain she felt towards him while far away at her home, to the disregard she gave him when she saw him and even the scorn when they conversed as well as the contempt she felt from her bones towards him. In the end, all she found out was that she was actually the one who should be looking up to and admiring him!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

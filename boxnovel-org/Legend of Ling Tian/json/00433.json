They were all in prime condition and it was obvious that they weren\u2019t too weak.</p><br/><p>However, Ling Tian felt a sense of depression in his heart. Could it be that these people thought that they could stop him with so few people? They are overestimating themselves and underestimating him! Thinking about that, Ling Tian circulated his inner qi and sent his spiritual sense out to his surroundings.</p><br/><p>The person in the lead shouted out, \u201cLing Tian, you are truly gutsy! You actually dare to walk into our territory so openly! Do you truly think that you are invincible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue chuckled and said softly, \u201cYoung noble Ling, you have to grasp this opportunity to have some fun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian glared at her and replied, \u201cI suddenly remembered an appropriate saying for this occasion: The Yu Family, truly demonic. A turtle appearing right when we were talking about a tortoise. Mmm, speak of the devil. Li Xue couldn\u2019t help but hold onto her sides as she giggled. At the same time, Ling Tian let out a hearty laugh, \u201cThere are definitely many people in the world who are capable of taking care of me. However, it would definitely not be you. Report your name to this young noble, this young noble will never kill a nameless individual!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ling Tian say the classic \u2018this young noble will never kill a nameless individual\u2019 from her past life, Li Xue couldn\u2019t rein in her laughter as she squatted down and clutched her tummy while laughing uncontrollably. With a smile from a beauty, countries and cities would definitely topple. But for a beauty to laugh so uncontrollably like that, it would be impossible for the cities and countries to topple!</p><br/><p>While these men didn\u2019t mention their origins, Ling Tian was certain that they were from the Yu Family! In truth, in the Northern Wei Empire, only the Yu Family would be capable of arranging manpower to kill him the moment they received news about him. No one else would have the strength or guts to do so!</p><br/><p>The person leading the crowd took a step forward and when his feet landed on the ground, a loud \u2018bang\u2019 sounded as a huge dust of cloud rose into the air. Facing the powerful Ling Tian, he was nervous to the point he had unknowingly circulated his inner qi all around his body and every action carried all of his strength! He then roared, \u201cLing Tian, come out and meet your death!\u201d A powerful inner qi was imbued within the roar and it sounded like thunder, echoing far and wide. His imposing manner was truly rather frightening!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to do it? Or do you want me to do it?\u201d Ling Tian smiled and looked at Li Xue, \u201cLook at how nervous he is, with his body all tensed up. I dare to bet that his stomach definitely has six-packs. If you don\u2019t believe me, I will strip him naked for you to take a look. Let us gamble on a title. If you lose, you will be called little doggy from now on. How about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue chuckled as her face turned red. Rolling her eyes, she pursed her lips, \u201cThey are here to find Ling Tian and not me. What has this got to do with me? You still want to gamble with me? I have never seen anyone so senseless like you! Who cares if he has six or eight packs, is it very rare?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have the guts to make the bet?\u201d Ling Tian teased, \u201cDo you remember that you have never won a bet with me before. Poor lass.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s have a bet! Would I be afraid of you?\u201d Li Xue replied, \u201cYou can fight him if you want, I am too lazy to make a move. Dealing with a bunch of men like them would only dirty my hands. You are also a man yourself and would you require the help of a lady?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you want to distance yourself from the matter, there will probably be people looking for you.\u201d Ling Tian chuckled and whispered into Li Xue\u2019s ears, \u201cDo you see that? Every one of them looks like they are s*xually deprived. There were even many of them who swallowed a mouthful of saliva when looking at you. I wonder what they were thinking about, can you make a guess? Hehe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s face turned red as she grabbed onto Ling Tian\u2019s ears and scolded fiercely, \u201cDo you dare to say it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Tian cried out in pain and said softly, \u201cHow would this few of them dare to block my way? There is definitely an ambush elsewhere. There are a few dangerous auras approaching us from the forest on the side, and a few experts are also in ambush behind us. The two of us can\u2019t take action together. If one of us were to take action, the other should stay behind as support. The one watching the fight is more important than the one fighting. It is best for you to consider the matter carefully. I am afraid that with your feeble martial arts, you may be captured by the enemy and things would be bad. If you were truly captured, should I surrender myself or escape immediately?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xue\u2019s immediate response was to send a kick to Ling Tian\u2019s ass as she scolded, \u201cYou are the one who is going to be captured! If you were to be captured, this Miss here will definitely not bother saving you!\u201d She was originally listening to what Ling Tian had to say attentively, nodding her head in agreement. However, she never imagined Ling Tian to suddenly change the topic to her being captured! This made Li Xue feel as though she was toyed with as a ball of frustration rose in her heart.</p><br/><p>Wary of Ling Tian\u2019s martial arts, the forty plus experts didn\u2019t dare to take the initiative to attack as they saw Ling Tian discussing something with Li Xue. However, they suddenly saw how a squabble broke out and the lady kicked Ling Tian in the ass, sending Ling Tian flying towards them! They couldn\u2019t help but be filled with joy as they brandished their blades and wanted to slash Ling Tian\u2019s descending figure!</p><br/><p>Right when they were about to dice Ling Tian into pieces, the situation took another turn and Ling Tian\u2019s pathetic figure suddenly paused in mid-air before descending rapidly to the ground. Before he could land onto the ground, he suddenly flew laterally along the ground like a leaf drifting around in the wind, charging straight into the formation of people in front of him!</p><br/><p>Before they could do anything, Ling Tian\u2019s palms had cleaved out like two gigantic axes and miserable groans sounded. Four burly men collapsed onto the ground and could no longer get up. The bones below their knees were fractured as though they had been cleaved by a sharp blade, with their calves dangling from their knees only being held on by a small piece of skin. Blood was spurting everywhere and it was an extremely gory sight.</p><br/><p>The ground surrounding the four burly men was completely dyed in blood! The four of them rolled on the ground moaning and groaning in pain. None of them could believe that they had turned into cripples in just an instant!</p><br/><p>A look of fear could be seen in the eyes of everyone present as they stood rooted to the ground. Seeing the miserable appearance of their comrades, they couldn\u2019t help but feel a chill run down their spine. There were a few of them who couldn\u2019t control themselves and began puking their guts out.</p><br/><p>Behind them, Ling Tian stood with his hands behind his back nonchalantly without a single drop of blood on his white robes! Seeing the scene in front of him, Ling Tian clapped his hands and chuckled, \u201cI already came out to accept my death but all of you should display some sincerity. With some of you collapsing, others puking, and the rest in a daze, how do you expect this young noble to accept my death? Err, are you guys thinking of disgusting this young noble to death? Well, I can\u2019t say that it is a bad idea!\u201d</p><br/><p>The burly man in the lead let out a roar with his eyes turning red. With a forceful stamp of his feet, he charged towards Ling Tian and the sword in his hand was brandished, unleashing a brilliant flower made from sword qi.</p><br/><p>Ling Tian laughed heartily as he dashed straight into the sword qi with his bare hands! It was as though he was a butterfly flying into a bed of roses!</p><br/><p>That burly man was appalled! Despite the fact that he should have the upper hand with his weapon, he could feel that Ling Tian was the one with the upper hand! Ling Tian stuck himself within a foot of his chest and the three foot long nimble sword suddenly felt as though it was far too long! The burly man felt as though he had a body full of strength but just couldn\u2019t use it at all! He could feel his opponent\u2019s palms weaving around his sword qi, occasionally grabbing onto the tip of his sword with two fingers, occasionally slapping the back of his sword with a palm, occasionally touching the body of his sword\u2026</p><br/><p>If he tried to take a step forward, Ling Tian would take a step back and remain close beside him. If he were to take a step back, Ling Tian would also follow closely! This\u2026 just what kind of a tactic was this? The burly man was crying out bitterly in his heart. He had always been a vicious character for all his life but felt that his hands and feet were completely tied today!</p><br/><p>Could it be that I am going to die here today? The burly man couldn\u2019t help but think to himself.</p><br/><p>After a short few minutes, the burly man was already drenched in sweat and panting like a bull! He could feel that Ling Tian had countless opportunities to kill him but chose not to do so! From the view of an outsider, it was as though the both of them were having an extremely close fight. However, he was very clear that he had long lost the fight and he should have died many times already!</p><br/><p>While they were all here to hold Ling Tian back and create opportunities, wasn\u2019t Ling Tian also making use of them to lure out the experts who were in hiding? Both parties had their own schemes and plan in mind.</p><br/><p>By the side, the other burly men couldn\u2019t understand what was going on and upon witnessing the intense battle between the two began to cheer, \u201cBig brother, good swordplay!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill this little thief and take revenge for our brothers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing those cheers, the burly man had the urge to bury his head in the ground and never reveal his face again! How embarrassing\u2026 to think that they are usually pretty witty\u2026 can\u2019t they tell that I am about to be bullied to death?</p><br/><p>A bright laugh suddenly sounded and Ling Tian spun around and retreated from the battle. With a bright smile on his face, Ling Tian held onto a complete set of robes on his left hand and a pair of pants on his right\u2026</p><br/><p>Opposite him, the burly man held onto his long sword and spun around on the spot foolishly. Feeling the sudden chill on his body, the burly man looked down and fell into a daze.</p><br/><p>The only thing left on his body was a pair of boxer shorts. His upper body muscles were well developed with a thick forest of chest hair fluttering gently in the winds\u2026 His hairy legs were also exposed in the air, and the burly man was like an underwear model, displaying his glory in broad daylight and on the streets!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

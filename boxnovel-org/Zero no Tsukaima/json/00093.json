Even if she were healthy, she could not carry eight people and fly for an hour. There was no other way, since Sylphid was still a young dragon.</p><br/><p>The plan was to enter Germania temporarily after traveling two days by coach, then cross Zerbst\u2019s territory to enter Tristain.</p><br/><p>The ones at the coachman\u2019s seat, taking care of the bridles, were Guiche and Malicorne. Looking ahead, they were chatting in voices mixed with fatigue and excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Guiche.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you think about it carefully, we have just done something terrible huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh-huh. We\u2019ve done it this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWonder what my father and mother would be thinking at home. When I said I wanted to serve the Imperial Guards, they were so happy\u2026 And now we\u2019re going back as criminals. It\u2019ll probably cause a huge trouble. Huh, I\u2019ll really trouble them now. Geez.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you regretting your actions?\u201d Guiche asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrankly speaking, a little. But I\u2019d be more regretful if I hadn\u2019t gone along, I think. Constantly harassed by our female classmates. If I hadn\u2019t helped you at all, I would have become not a noble, but a commoner instead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Malicorne said, sighing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s so, then don\u2019t regret it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guiche clapped Malicorne\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a good guy! One of these days you\u2019ll get a lover. I guarantee it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if Guiche guarantees it, I\u2019m still not happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Poking her head out from the carriage into the space between the two, Montmorency sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh, why did I follow you all until here\u2026 If I think about it, ain\u2019t I at the frontier of Halkeginia?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha!\u201d</p><br/><p>Montmorency glared at Guiche who had laughed optimistically.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you laughing at! I\u2019m asking what we should do when we go back to Tristain!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not thinking about that. When it comes, it comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShouldn\u2019t we think about going back to our country first? Although it\u2019s good that we rescued Tabitha, it doesn\u2019t guarantee a safe return right? Not just the Gallian army. Seems like the elves are those guys\u2019 allies too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Montmorency let out a huge sigh. Guiche put his arm around her shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, my Montmorency. I\u2019ll give my life to protect you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did I get the short end of the stick?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay! For some reason, my luck is strong! We\u2019ll manage it this time too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not that. I\u2019m saying that my choosing you is in itself a mistake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Glaring steadily at Guiche, Montmorency said that.</p><br/><p>\u201cH-How could this be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Guiche was dumbfounded. Montmorency planted a kiss at his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy that miserable look?</p><br/><p>\u201cMonmo\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At Guiche who looked up with feverish eyes, Montmorency declared.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez. Don\u2019t give up. We\u2019ll make it somehow! 'Cause I\u2019m really not going to jail!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the wagon that was covered with a cloth, wrapped in straw, Kirche and the mother and child were snoring gently. Tabitha\u2019s mother was asleep due to Montmorency\u2019s potion. That\u2019s because she would struggle violently when awake. Cuddling her mother closely, Tabitha was sleeping. She had certainly gone through much.</p><br/><p>Covered in bandages, Kirche was sleeping too. Her burns were recovering due to Montmorency\u2019s water magic, but\u2026 She had used up a lot of her strength.</p><br/><p>Sylphid was sleeping in between Kirche and Tabitha.</p><br/><p>The ones still awake in the wagon were Saito and Louise.</p><br/><p>Looking at the sleeping Tabitha, Saito said,</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Louise.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how Tabitha felt, huh\u2026 Fighting alone all along like that\u2026 No matter how I think about it, looks like I\u2019m more blessed. The ones who would help their friends, that\u2019s really like you\u2026 But, this girl has always been alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs I thought, although we have gone against Her Majesty and Agnes to that extent, I think it\u2019s good that we left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito said so earnestly. Louise nodded too.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you going to do once we go back to Tristain, Louise? First we\u2019ll rescue teacher, is there anywhere for us to hide?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise glared at Saito.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to the palace openly and receive our verdict. What we have just done may not be wrong. But that does not change the fact that we have brought trouble upon the Princess and our motherland. We are lawbreakers. We have no choice but to receive our punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Uh-huh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito nodded, tired. <i>How long would I be jailed? But still, I have no regrets. I think I would be more remorseful if I hadn\u2019t done this.</i></p><br/><p>Seeing Saito acting in that way, Louise said in an angry-like voice;</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Only I have to go into jail.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cEhh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust say that I, Her Majesty\u2019s court lady, had incited you guys, the Imperial Guards into action.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-What!? Don\u2019t joke around! I brought everyone along! It\u2019s my fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>But, Louise was no longer looking at Saito. Gazing straight ahead, her mouth was tight shut, and a determined look hung on her face.</p><br/><p>Despite wearing the dancer\u2019s costume, Louise\u2019s nobility was not damaged one bit. Instead, that lowly costume caused Louise\u2019s demeanor as a noble to stand out.</p><br/><p>Saito reminisced the time when he met Louise. The time when he was almost stepped on by the golem, Louise who said, <i>\u201cA mage who abandons his familiar is not a mage!\u201d</i> Louise had not changed since then. The girl who never neglected the \u201cpride\u201d within her\u2026</p><br/><p>Hiding such thoughts within her heart, Louise was divinely beautiful. <i>I grew to like her because she\u2019s like that.</i> Saito thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cLouise\u2026 I\u2026 You are really great. Umm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito reached out for Louise\u2019s left hand nervously. But that hand avoided him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-Don\u2019t be angry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nervous, Saito\u2019s hands reached out for Louise\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I say not to touch me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise\u2019s face swelled, and she turned away. Those cheeks turned red. The third time he hugged her shoulders, she did not brush it away. She pursed her lips in an annoyed look, her body stiffening.</p><br/><p>Simply speaking, Louise at that state was intensely cute. Saito could not help but to press his lips closer.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise resisted.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-That\u2019s right! Kissing is a reward. Since I haven\u2019t received anything like a reward. But, I still like to do this. Very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito said impatiently, and <i>nyah</i>~~~~~~ displayed an extra large smile. It was an utmost evil smile.</p><br/><p><i>As I thought\u2026 such pathetic face is not something he acquired as Gand\u00e1lfr. Just like what Saito said just now, courage, love\u2026 These are surely born from within him\u2026</i></p><br/><p>When she thought about that, relief and a sense of mastery gushed forth in unison. <i>Of course, this fellow is still my servant, right. How do I say it \u2013the worshiper of love, right.</i></p><br/><p><i>And yet I had worried about it and became miserable. My injured pride demands a restoration of honor.</i> Louise stood up and folded her arms.</p><br/><p>With an absolutely triumphant voice, she looked down at Saito.</p><br/><p>\u201cEhhhhhhhhhh? You, what did you say you want to do with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ki-kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t hear you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Combing her hair back in an exaggerated action, Louise declared that haughtily.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said I would like to ki-kiss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito was already kneeling and speaking politely. Grasping his fists tightly above his knees, he was trembling all over, somewhat regretfully. <i>I can\u2019t help it. The moment I said I wanted to kiss her, I had already lost.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cYou really want it? Say it please. How much do you want it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cV-Very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVery much? Don\u2019t be that abstract! You want to kiss me right? This is the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard. So this beast says with a straight face that he wants to kiss his master. How touching.\u201d</p><br/><p>\"I-I am not a beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito had already started using \"mon<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-1\"></sup>\". That\u2019s a result of his expanding humility due to his wanting to wholeheartedly kiss Louise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not a beast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise raised her eyebrows.</p><br/><p>Kirche, the maid, Jessica, pseudo-breasts, the Princess. Various incidences of her pride being bruised were brought back to her like a kaleidoscope that changed its shape.</p><br/><p>Her anger towards those memories had finally made Louise wake up.</p><br/><p>Louise started putting on her miraculous impish manner. She did not learn it from anyone. Probably, that was because some part of Louise was asleep. Until now, it had only lain dormant without coming out to the surface. While watching Saito\u2019s reaction, Louise started manipulating that imp of hers that had formerly come out only unconsciously.</p><br/><p>Smiling, Louise first stood with her arms akimbo. Because of only that pose, Saito almost died.</p><br/><p>Not satisfied with that, Louise raised one of her legs, and placed it against the wall. Her dancer costume\u2019s loincloth was lifted up, and her thighs which drew Louise\u2019s delicate lines were burned into Saito\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>At the same time, she cast a flirtatious, sneering glance at him.</p><br/><p>Breathing had already become difficult for Saito.</p><br/><p>In a singing-like voice, Louise said to Saito.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what did you say you want to do to me? What did\u2019ya say? Use that funny mouth of yours. With unique, helpless words which can make me laugh. Together with that sickening dog-look, say that word!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKi-Kiss\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell then, praise me.\u201d</p><br/><p>With an increasingly triumphant attitude, Louise said further.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPraise me until I\u2019m happy. Oh yeah, firstly, that maid. Give me 100 parts of me that are better than Siesta. If not, I won\u2019t let you do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito was confused, but he still continued.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-You\u2019re\u2026 Which parts are better errr\u2026 You have good points; Siesta has good points too\u2026 As a rule\u2026\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like this child didn\u2019t hear it properly. I said to praise me. Praise your master, your ruler, your god! Can\u2019t you hear? Feel like dying, are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the height of this chaos, the taboo came out of Saito\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 Louise\u2026 yeah! Your breasts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re making fun of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise\u2019s lips distorted into something evil. She put strength into her stamping foot. <i>Ouuuuuu</i> A groan escaped Saito\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>At that instant\u2026</p><br/><p>The sound of someone coughing could be heard.</p><br/><p>Louise turned back, and saw that Guiche, Montmorency and Malicorne were staring at them from the coachman\u2019s seat.</p><br/><p>Being delirious, she had completely forgotten their existence. Louise\u2019s face turned crimson. Because Saito was beginning a journey in his dream, he did not realize anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cErrr\u2026 Louise. If you don\u2019t finish it, your name will be\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Guiche said that with a troubled face.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid. If you\u2019re bored, p-please practice your drama! Isn\u2019t that so, Saito?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Saito could not reply because he had already fainted. Louise cheerfully lifted Saito up, and just like how Siesta did last time, turned him around.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey. Saito here. Just now was the practice of our play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Whilst shaking their heads, Guiche and the others looked to the front. Sighing, Malicorne hit the horse with his bridle.</p><br/><p>The coach they were in sped up.</p><br/><p>Anxiety, joy, hope, and then pride and self-respect... Fully loaded with various feelings, the coach headed towards the country border of Germania, dashing across the streets under the moonlight of the twin moons.</p><br/><p>Tabitha was dreaming.</p><br/><p>At the dear Orl\u00e9ans mansion at the lakeside of Ragdorian Lake... There was a table at the center, and her gentle parents were having some snacks whilst chatting pleasantly.</p><br/><p>Being watched over by both of them, the doll her mother bought for her... With \u201cTabitha\u201d, the doll which could not be said to be very beautiful, beside her, she was reading a book. She was reading out \u201cThe Hero of Ivaldi\u201d in a clear voice, a book which she had read for many times. A cheerful voice that she no longer had, was flowing out of her.</p><br/><p>Those gentle times that had disappeared at the other side of timeline - they were right there.</p><br/><p>Within the dream, Tabitha realized that she was in dreamland. That's because her father who was smiling so warmly, had already passed away.</p><br/><p>Percerin , the butler, appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, the guests have arrived,\u201d he informed them. <i>Please show them here</i>, her mother said. <i>Charlotte's friends? That's quite rare,</i> her father said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Her academy friends' faces showed up at the courtyard.</p><br/><p>With bunches of flowers in their hands, Guiche and Malicorne came forth. Montmorency was with them too.</p><br/><p>With a somewhat embarrassed face, Louise handed Tabitha a paper bag. There were many sweets inside.</p><br/><p>With her dazzlingly red hair, Kirche showed up. Smiling sweetly, she hugged Tabitha. Embraced by her close friend, Tabitha was touched without a reason. A friend's warmth is the hardest to substitute. Tabitha felt as if her frozen heart was melting.</p><br/><p>Another close friend descended from the sky, and licked Tabitha.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have informed us, right?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Kyui</i>, Sylphid happily purred. Tabitha gently patted the chin of her faithful familiar. Sylphid squinted her eyes.</p><br/><p>The last one to show up was Saito.</p><br/><p>Carrying a sword at his back, he approached Tabitha slowly, and bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSorry, I'm late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tabitha smiled shyly and turned away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hero of Ivaldi\u201d she was carrying slipped from her hands.</p><br/><p><i>Is it because I've found my hero?</i></p><br/><p>In that immensely gentle, warm dream, Tabitha thought that.</p><br/><p></p><h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Translator.27s_Notes_and_References\">Translator's Notes and References</span><span class=\"mw-editsection\"><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">[</span><span class=\"mw-editsection-bracket\">]</span></span></h2><ol class=\"references\"><li id=\"cite_note-1\"><span class=\"mw-cite-backlink\"></span><span class=\"reference-text\">\"Mono\" is added to sentence ends as a feminine way of emphasis/explaining.

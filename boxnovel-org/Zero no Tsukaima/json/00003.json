Still groggy, she stared at the window for a moment before remembering what happened last night.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026 a lot of people came, and I blasted them away.\u201d</p><br/><p>She stopped caring about her window entirely after that. She got up and began putting on makeup, while excitedly plotting how she should seduce Saito today. Kirche was a born hunter.</p><br/><p>When she was done, she left the room and knocked on Louise\u2019s door. She rested her chin on one hand, hiding her smile. <i>Saito will open the door, and I'll immediately embrace and kiss him. Oh\u2026 what will Louise do when she sees that\u2026</i> Kirche thought.</p><br/><p><i>And then, right\u2026 I can try to eye him outside the room, and maybe he\u2019ll approach me himself.</i> The thought of rejection never entered her mind.</p><br/><p>However there was no answer after she had knocked. She tried to open the door but it was locked. Without a second thought, she used an unlocking spell on Louise\u2019s door, and was rewarded with a click. In reality, unlocking spells were forbidden on campus, but Kirche didn\u2019t care. \u201cPassion above all\u201d was the rule of her house.</p><br/><p>But the room was empty. The two weren\u2019t there.</p><br/><p>Kirche looked around the room. \u201cStill the same\u2026 a tasteless room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise\u2019s backpack wasn't there. Adding that fact with the Day of Void meant they had gone out somewhere. Kirche looked out the window and saw two people on horseback, ready to depart; it was Saito and Louise.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Going out, huh?\u201d Kirche mumbled in annoyance.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a while, she quickly left Louise\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>Tabitha was in her room, deep in her sea of books. Under her light blue hair and glasses were bright blue eyes that sparkled like the ocean. Tabitha looked four or five years younger than she actually was. She was even a bit shorter than the already short Louise, and her body was quite slim. However, she didn\u2019t care about these things. She was a girl that would rather not care about what people thought of her.</p><br/><p>Tabitha loved Days of Void. They're when she could sink into her favorite worlds. In her eyes, everyone else was an intruder in her own little world, giving a melancholic feel to her.</p><br/><p>Before long, strong knocks rocked her door. Without standing up, Tabitha simply picked up and waved her staff, which seemed to exceed her height. She cast \u201cSpell of Tranquility\u201d, a wind-type spell. Tabitha was a mage of the wind affinity. \u201cSpell of Tranquility\u201d effectively blocked out those distracting door knocks. Satisfied, she returned to her reading, her expression remaining unchanged throughout the encounter.</p><br/><p>Then somebody forcefully broke the door open. Noticing the intruder, Tabitha moved her eyes from her book. It was Kirche. She began babbling about something, but with the silencing magic, none of her words reached Tabitha.</p><br/><p>Kirche took away Tabitha\u2019s book, and then grabbed the little reader\u2019s shoulders to make her look at her. Tabitha blankly looked at Kirche, her face unreadable. However, one could see that she had an unwelcoming gaze.</p><br/><p>But Kirche was Tabitha\u2019s friend. She would have blown anyone else away with a cyclone. Seeing no other way, Tabitha canceled her magic. As if a lock was opened, Kirche\u2019s voice instantly emerged. \u201cTabitha! Get ready, we\u2019re going out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tabitha only softly explained to her friend, \u201cDay of Void.\u201d That explanation was enough for Tabitha, who attempted to take her book back from Kirche\u2019s grasp. Kirche stood up and raised the book high in the air, their height difference barring Tabitha from the book.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I know how Days of Void are important to you, I really do. But now\u2019s not the time for this talk! I\u2019m in love! It\u2019s love! Do you get it now?\u201d She didn\u2019t, and shook her head. Kirche was propelled by her emotions, but Tabitha was a calm and collected thinker. One can only wonder how such polarized people could be such good friends.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight\u2026 you won\u2019t move until I explain. Geez\u2026 I. AM. IN. LOVE! But that lad is going out with that damn annoying Louise today! I want to go after them, and find out where they\u2019re going! Do you get it <i>now</i>?\u201d Tabitha still didn\u2019t, because she still didn\u2019t know why that mattered to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey just left! On horseback! I can\u2019t catch up without your familiar, you know? Please help me at least with that!\u201d Kirche started crying. Tabitha finally nodded. <i>So that\u2019s why\u2026 you need my familiar to catch up.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cOh thank you so much\u2026 so\u2026 let\u2019s hurry up!\u201d Tabitha nodded again. Kirche was her friend, and she couldn\u2019t help it if her friends had their problems that they couldn\u2019t take care of themselves. It was a bit annoying, but she didn\u2019t have a choice. She opened her window, and whistled. The sound of the whistle rang in the azure sky for a moment. She then jumped out of the window.</p><br/><p>Those who did not know her would have found it weird, if not alarming. Kirche, however, followed close after Tabitha and jumped out the window without a thought. Just a note \u2013 Tabitha\u2019s room was on the fifth floor. She tended to forego the door altogether when she had to go outside since jumping out the window was far quicker for her.</p><br/><p>Strong and tough wings spread out to the wind. Then, a wind dragon flew into the air and received its two passengers.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Sylphid is still so awesome no matter how many times I see it!\u201d Kirche grabbed a protruding spine and sighed in admiration. That\u2019s right \u2013 Tabitha\u2019s familiar is an infant wind dragon.</p><br/><p>The dragon, which got the name of the \"Fairies of the Air\" from Tabitha, swiftly and perfectly caught the upward draft around the tower, and reached 200 mails in the air in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d Tabitha succinctly asked Kirche.</p><br/><p>Kirche immediately cried, \u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 I was panicking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tabitha didn\u2019t mind and commanded her wind dragon, \u201cTwo people on horseback. Don\u2019t eat them.\u201d Her dragon made a short grunt, showing understanding. Its blue scales glittered, and its wings flapped strongly to the wind. It flew high in the air, scouring the ground for a horse; a simple task for a wind dragon.</p><br/><p>Satisfied that her familiar was doing its job, Tabitha snatched her book back from Kirche\u2019s hands, leaned back against the dragon, and started reading again.</p><br/><p></p><center>* * *</center><br/><p>Meanwhile, Saito and Louise walked briskly on Tristain\u2019s city streets, having deposited their campus-loaned horse at the city gate\u2019s stables.</p><br/><p>Saito\u2019s sides ached profusely, it was his first time on a horse, after all. \u201cMy sides hurt\u2026\u201d Saito moaned, walking slowly.</p><br/><p>Louise glanced at Saito and frowned. \u201cYou\u2019re useless. You haven\u2019t even been on a horse before? Commoners are just\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you\u2019re annoying. We\u2019ve been on that thing for three straight hours!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 we can\u2019t walk our way here now can we?\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite the pain, Saito curiously looked around. <i>White cobblestone roads\u2026 feels like a theme park here.</i> Compared to the Academy, there were far more people in common garb here. On the street side were vendors selling fruit and meat.</p><br/><p>Saito\u2019s love for exotic places momentarily rose. But this was a weird world. There were people briskly walking and people frantically running. Males and females of all ages walked the streets. This bore no difference with Saito\u2019s world, though the streets were a bit narrower.</p><br/><p>\u201cA little bit tight here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTight? This is a really wide street as it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust this?\u201d <i>Not even 5 meters wide.</i> With this many people walking around, every step felt cramped.</p><br/><p>\u201cBourdonn\u00e9 Street, Tristain\u2019s widest avenue. The palace is straight ahead.\u201d Louise pointed.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cCan we go to the palace, then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat business do we have visiting Her Majesty The Queen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to ask her to increase my portion of food.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise laughed.</p><br/><p>The streets were filled with shops. Saito, full of curiosity, could not take his eyes off them. When he looked at one weird-shaped frog in a jar on a trader\u2019s mat, Louise pulled him by the ear. \u201cHey, don\u2019t walk around corners. There are lots of thieves and pickpockets here. You <i>are</i> looking after my wallet in your jacket, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise said wallets are for servants to carry, and mercilessly gave that duty to Saito. The wallet was heavily filled with gold coins.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am\u2026 I am\u2026 very carefully, too. How can anyone steal something that heavy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith magic, that can be done in a second.\u201d</p><br/><p>But there was nobody around that looked like a mage. Saito learned how to discern between commoners and mages in the Academy. Mages always had capes on, and they looked really arrogant when they walk. According to Louise, that was a noble\u2019s walking stance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t they all commoners?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Nobles only take up 10% of the population, and there\u2019s no way they will walk in slums like these.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would nobles steal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll nobles are mages, but not all mages are nobles. If for whatever reason a noble is disowned from their family, left the family name on his or her own accord, dropped status to be a mercenary or a criminal\u2026 Hey! Are you listening?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito wasn\u2019t. He was too fascinated by the street signs.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that bottle-shaped sign say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrewery.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what does that sign with a big cross say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a recruiting center for guards.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito stopped at every meaningful sign, and Louise had to pull him away by his wrist every time.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay, okay, I understand, you don\u2019t have to be in a hurry like that. Where\u2019s the blacksmith\u2019s shop?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOver here. They don't just sell swords though.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise walked into an even narrower road. A revolting stench, coming from piles of trash and other dirty things on the ground, soon hit their noses.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s really dirty here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you nobles don\u2019t come here that often.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the fourth intersection, Louise stopped and looked around.</p><br/><p>\u201cShould be near Peyman\u2019s Potion Shop\u2026 I remember it\u2019s around here somewhere\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She saw a bronze sign and happily cried, \u201cAh! Found it!\u201d</p><br/><p>A sword-shaped sign dangled under it. It looked like this was the arms dealer\u2019s shop. Louise and Saito walked up the stone stops, opened the door, and entered the shop.</p><br/><p>Despite the bright daylight outside, the shop was a bit dark inside. A gas lamp flickered. The walls and shelves were filled with unorganized weapons. A detailed suit of armor decorated the room. A man in his fifties smoking a pipe eyed Louise suspiciously. That is, until he saw the pentagram on her golden button. He removed his pipe and said, \u201cMy lady! My noble lady! All of my wares here are real and reasonably priced! There\u2019s nothing criminal here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be your customer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 that\u2019s rather weird\u2026 a noble buying a sword! Quite strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 priests wave sacred staffs, soldiers wave swords, and nobles wave wands. Isn\u2019t that the rule?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m not the one using it. My familiar is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026 a familiar that can use a sword, huh?\u201d The shopkeeper spoke in a lively voice, and looked at Saito. \u201cI believe that would be this gentleman over there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise nodded. By this time, Saito had already been pulled in by the shop\u2019s vast collection of swords, periodically making cries of \u201cwhoa!\u201d and \u201cthis one\u2019s awesome!\u201d.</p><br/><p>Louise ignored Saito, and continued, \u201cI\u2019m not very knowledgeable about swords, so please show me anything that is reasonable.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shopkeeper jubilantly walked into his warehouse, silently rambling, \u201cOh, this is too great\u2026 I can raise the prices so high with this\u2026\u201d shortly afterwards, he returned with a longsword of about a mail in length. It was a very exquisitely decorated sword. It looked like one could swing it with just one hand. There was even a hand guard on the short handle.</p><br/><p>The shopkeeper said as though he just thought of something, \u201cSpeaking of which, it seems that nobles like to let their servants bear swords lately. The last time any of them came to pick one from me, they picked this type.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>I see\u2026 a shiny, glittering sword. Very well-suited for a noble.</i> thought Louise.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that the trend?\u201d Louise asked. The shopkeeper naturally nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. It seems that there\u2019s an increase of thievery on Tristain\u2019s city streets lately\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThievery?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Some mage thief that calls himself something like \u2018Fouquet the Crumbling Dirt,\u2019 and I heard he stole a lot of treasures from the nobles. Those nobles are getting really rattled, so they\u2019re arming their servants with swords.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise had no interest in thieves and focused on the sword instead. It looked like something that would break in an instant. Saito wielded a sword that was a lot bigger last time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d prefer something bigger and broader.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy lady, please forgive my bluntness \u2013 swords and people have compatibilities, just like men and women. As I look at it, this sword fits my noble lady\u2019s familiar very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t I say I want something bigger and broader?\u201d said Louise, impatiently lowering her head. The shopkeeper went inside again, remembering to silently mumble, \u201cOh, the laymen\u2026\u201d After a while, he returned, one hand rubbing the new specimen with an oily rag.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about this one?\u201d It was a splendid broadsword of around a mail and a half in length. The handle was made for two-handed wielding and was lavishly decorated with jewels. A mirror-like blade reflected light with an irresistible glow. Anyone could look at it and say it was a very sharp and broad blade. \u201cThis is the best thing I have. Rather than say it\u2019s for nobles, it\u2019s more like something nobles <i>wish</i> they can wear on their waists, but that\u2019s something reserved for very strong men. If not, wearing it on the back isn\u2019t half bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito walked closer, his eyes staring at the sword. \u201cAwesome. That sword looks really powerful.\u201d Saito instantly wanted it. It was a magnificent sword no matter how he looked at it. <i>I guess this one\u2019s fine\u2026</i>Louise thought, seeing Saito\u2019s satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much?\u201d she asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 it\u2019s made by the famous Germanian alchemist Lord Shupei. It can cut through metal like butter because of the magic infused in it! See this inscription here?\u201d The shopkeeper proudly pointed at the words on the handle. \u201cYou can\u2019t get this cheaper anywhere else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m a noble.\u201d Louise held her head up high.</p><br/><p>At that, the shopkeeper bluntly gave the price, \u201cTwo thousand \u00e9cus, or three thousand new gold coins.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?! You can buy a holiday home with a garden with that!\u201d Louise said, shocked. Saito, with no idea of the currency\u2019s value, stood dumbly.</p><br/><p>\u201cA famous sword is worth as much as a castle, my lady. A holiday home is quite cheap compared to this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I only brought 100 new gold coins\u2026\u201d Louise, being a noble, had little skill in bargaining, and made the taboo of giving away her wallet\u2019s contents. The shopkeeper only waved his hand dismissively. \u201cCome on\u2026 even standard broadswords cost at least 200 new gold coins.\u201d Louise\u2019s face turned red. <i>I didn\u2019t even know swords cost that much.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2026 we can\u2019t buy this?\u201d Saito said in a disappointed tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah\u2026 we\u2019ll have to go for something more affordable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNobles are always so arrogant, and now\u2026\u201d Saito mumbled. At that, Louise stared at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have any idea how much potions cost, because <i>somebody</i> got himself seriously injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Saito lowered his head in embarrassment. He still reluctantly caressed the sword. \u201cBut I really like this sword\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, a deep, male voice came from a messy pile of swords, \u201cDon\u2019t be so prideful, kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise and Saito looked towards the sound. The shopkeeper held his hands to his head.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you look at yourself for a moment? You? Wield <i>that</i> sword? Don\u2019t make me laugh. You\u2019re only fit for a stick!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Saito did not take that insult kindly, but there\u2019s not a single being in that sound\u2019s direction to be angry at. It was just a pile of swords.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you get it, then go home. Yes, you! That noble girl over there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow impolite of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito slowly approached the sound. \u201cWhat\u2026 there\u2019s nobody here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre your eyes there just for decoration?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito looked behind him. <i>What? It\u2019s actually a sword that\u2019s saying it</i>. It came from a rusty, damaged sword. \u201cA talking sword!\u201d Saito exclaimed.</p><br/><p>The shopkeeper suddenly yelled angrily, \u201cDerf! Do not say such impolite things to my customers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDerf?\u201d Saito carefully inspected the sword. It was the same length as that huge broadsword, though its blade was slightly less broad. It was a thin longsword, although its surface was coated with rust, and one cannot say it was well made to any degree.</p><br/><p>\u201cCustomer? A customer that can\u2019t wield a sword? You\u2019ve got to be kidding me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be\u2026 that this is a sentient sword?\u201d asked Louise.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, lady. It\u2019s a sentient, magical, intelligent sword. I wonder what kind of mage could make a sword speak\u2026 but it\u2019s got a rotten tongue, always arguing with my customers. Hey, Derf! Keep up the insolence and I\u2019ll ask this noble here to melt you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSounds good to me! I\u2019d like to see you try it! I\u2019m kinda tired of this world. I\u2019d love to be melted down!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFine! Then I\u2019ll melt you down!\u201d The shopkeeper approached. But Saito stopped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s just so wasteful\u2026 isn\u2019t a speaking sword rather important?\u201d Saito stared at it. \u201cYou\u2019re called Derf, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong! It\u2019s Derflinger-sama! Remember that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust like a person, it even has a real name.\u201d Saito muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Saito Hiraga. Nice to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sword fell silent, and it seemed to closely observe Saito. After a while, it silently spoke. \u201cSo you came\u2026 are you a user?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA user?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026 you don\u2019t even know your true powers, huh? What\u2026 oh well! Buy me, my friend!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right. I\u2019ll buy you,\u201d said Saito. The sword went silent again.</p><br/><p>\u201cLouise, I\u2019ll take this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise reluctantly said, \u201cOh\u2026 you want <i>this</i> thing? You can\u2019t pick anything prettier that <i>doesn't</i> talk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t like this one? I think a speaking sword\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee\u2026 that\u2019s why I don\u2019t like it.\u201d Louise complained. But she didn\u2019t have enough for anything else, so she asked the shopkeeper, \u201chow much for this one?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh\u2026 100 will do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that a bit cheap?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor that one? I\u2019ll let you take it for cheap.\u201d He waved his hand dismissively.</p><br/><p>Saito took out Louise\u2019s wallet from his jacket pocket, and poured its contents onto the counter. One by one, gold coins dropped onto the wooden surface. After careful counting, the shopkeeper finally nodded. \u201cThank you for your business!\u201d the shopkeeper said as he sheathed the sword and gave it to Saito. \u201cIf it gets noisy, just shove it back in the scabbard, and it\u2019ll shut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito nodded, and received Derflinger.</p><br/><p>Two figures watched Louise and Saito leave the weapons shop \u2013 Kirche and Tabitha. Kirche watched the two from the shadows of the streets, fiercely biting her lip. \u201cLouise the Zero\u2026 trying to warm your relationship with Saito with a sword, huh? Striking out with gifts so quickly after finding out he\u2019s my prey? What the heck?\u201d Kirche stamped the ground in anger. Tabitha, her job done, was reading as usual. Sylphid circled around the skies above them. They had followed the two here soon after they'd spotted them.</p><br/><p>Kirche waited for them to walk far away, and immediately ran into the weapons shop. The shopkeeper stared at Kirche as if he couldn\u2019t believe it. \u201cWhoa\u2026 another noble? What the hell is going on today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey there, boss\u2026\u201d Kirche played with her hair, a charming smile in her lips. The shopkeeper\u2019s face turned deep red under the sudden seduction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you happen to know what that noble bought not long ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA s-sword\u2026 she bought a sword.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI see\u2026 so she <i>did</i> get him a sword\u2026 what kind of sword?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA d-dirty and rusty one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRusty? Why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause she didn\u2019t bring enough money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Kirche laughed, her hand to her chin. \u201cShe went broke! Valli\u00e8re! Your Duke\u2019s house will cry for this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 is my lady here to buy a sword, too?\u201d The shopkeeper perked up, not willing to let go of the chance. <i>This noble looks racked and rich compared to that tiny one.</i></p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026 show me your best.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man walked inside, brushing his hands in excitement. He returned, of course, with the broadsword he just showed to Saito.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh\u2026 a very well-made sword!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a good eye, my lady. That noble not so long ago had a servant that really wanted this one, but it\u2019s too much for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d <i>The noble\u2019s servant? So Saito wants this!</i></p><br/><p>\u201cOf course\u2026 this sword <i>is</i> made by the famous Germanian alchemist Lord Shupei after all. It can cut through metal like butter because of the magic infused in it! See this inscription here?\u201d The shopkeeper repeated what he had said before.</p><br/><p>Kirche nodded. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shopkeeper asked for more, seeing how Kirche looked a lot richer, \u201cHmm\u2026 for new gold coins, 4500.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm\u2026 that\u2019s a bit pricey.\u201d Kirche frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026 great swords need to be paid for their worth, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Kirche thought for a while, slowly moving her body towards the shopkeeper. \u201cBoss\u2026 isn\u2019t this just a bit expensive?\u201d Upon being caressed at the throat, the salesman suddenly lost his breath. Temptations hit his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 but\u2026 great swords are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kirche sat on the counter, raising her left thigh. \u201cIsn\u2019t the price a bit <i>too high</i>?\u201d She slowly raised her left foot onto the counter. The salesman\u2019s eyes irresistibly stared at her thighs.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-that\u2019s right\u2026 then\u2026 4000 new gold\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kirche raised her thigh further so that he could <i>almost</i> see in between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 nonono, 3000 would do\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s getting hot in here\u2026\u201d Kirche ignored him, only opening her shirt\u2019s buttons. \u201cI feel really hot in here. Help me take off my shirt, please\u2026\u201d She threw her most attractive expression at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 I got it wrong, I got it wrong\u2026 it\u2019s 2500!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kirche took off one button, and looked up at the shopkeeper.</p><br/><p>\u201c1800! 1800\u2019s fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another button, exposing her cleavage. She looked at him again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, 1600 will do!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kirche stopped with her buttons, and turned her attention to her skirt instead, raising it just so little. The man looked like he could not take any more.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow does 1000 sound?\u201d she suggested, slowly lifting her skirt more. He looked like he was about to hyperventilate.</p><br/><p>And then she stopped. His rapid breathing turned to a sorrowful moan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 ohhhhh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Kirche straightened herself out, and asked again, \u201c1000.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh! 1000 will be fine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kirche stepped down from the counter, quickly wrote a check, and slapped it on the counter. \u201cBought!\u201d She then picked up the sword and left the shop, leaving the salesman to stare at her check.</p><br/><p>After a moment, he suddenly regained consciousness, holding his head. \u201cDAMMIT! I SOLD THAT BABY FOR JUST 1000?!\u201d He took a bottle of liquor from his cabinet. \u201cOhh\u2026 I\u2019m done for today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p></p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

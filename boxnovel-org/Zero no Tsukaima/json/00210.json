(This is an international release) (TN: Both Japanese and Taiwanese versions were released on the same day.)</p><br/><p>Presenting to you, 'Zero no Tsukaima 21\u2014The Truth of 6,000 years'. This is a new volume, 5 years since the release of the previous volume 'Holy Land of Ancient Times'. What is the fate of Louise and the others of the 'Austran' after invading the Elf Capital? Are the runes that appeared on Saito's chest the engravements of Tiffania's magic? What is the true identity of the pope Vittorio, who leads Halkeginia that is on the brink of destruction? What happened to the founder Brimir and the first Gand\u00e1lfr Sasha 6,000 years ago? The many mysterious and magnificent story will finally clear up at its very end.</p><br/><p>Most readers may know that Yamaguchi-sensei is no longer on this world. This 21st volume, and the next one, volume 22, were written based on the framework from Yamaguchi-sensei, and thus, I shall explain how this story was handed over.</p><br/><p>In the afterword of the 20th volume, Yamaguchi-sensei mentioned, 'the story is expected to end in another two volumes'. The story was going well, the climax was at hand, and he wanted to do a countdown with all the long-time fans who supported him. If it had gone to plan, the last volume could have been published a year later or so, and the initial topic back then was on how to continue after this story was written.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>When the 20th volume was released however, Yamaguchi-sensei was diagnosed with a critical illness. The situation was hopeless, he was initially informed that even an operation would not be able to save him. With astounding phyiscal strength and struggle against the illness however, Yamaguchi-sensei was able to fight back and at least delay the surgery. That alone could be considered a miracle.</p><br/><p>After the surgery, Yamaguchi-sensei had to enter and leave the hospital for treatment many times. According to Yamaguchi-sensei, the potent medication he had during hospitalization left him feeble, and thus, he had to wait for his body to recover during his temporary discharge, before being hospitalized again to consume the potent drugs again.</p><br/><p>Even though he was fighting so hard for his life,</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to write such a story.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to write this kind of story.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI really, really have lots of stories to write\u2014\u201d</p><br/><p>Yamaguchi-sensei was filled with the desire to write, not only 'Zero no Tsukaima' itself, but also many story concepts he came up with.</p><br/><p>However, the illness continued to sap away the energy and concentration he needed to write.</p><br/><p>And then, soon,</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to finish Zero no matter what. I hope that someone will continue to write it for me.\u201d Sensei said.</p><br/><p>From then, the plot was refined, and we looked into any potential candidates to write the story, giving our utmost in the remaining time left.</p><br/><p>And with much regret, on April 4th, 2013, after entrusting the work to an author Yamaguchi-sensei and the editorial branch fully trust in, Yamaguchi-sensei unfortunately departed for the afterlife.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>We shall not reveal the name of this author. For all the fans, we hope that you will have have any initial impressions, and enjoy the story of Zero.</p><br/><p>As for the readers who have read this work, Saito and Louise in this text remain the same as before. I did not feel anything awkward when reading the initial drafts, and it feels as thought Yamaguchi-sensei himself wrote the story. More importantly, the story of Zero no Tsukaima remains riveting, heart-thumping and comedic.</p><br/><p>It might be rude to say this, but if Yamaguchi-sensei is to see this,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is really amazing! It's like I wrote it personally. This might be more interesting than how I'll write it, you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Surely, he would jest.</p><br/><p>After a long time, 'Zero no Tsukaima' is only left with one volume. The will and promise of Yamaguchi-sensei will finally be fulfilled. To all the fans, I hope you'll continue to support this work passionately.</p><br/><p>Heisei 28th year, January 2016</p><br/><p>Issuer: Taiji Misaka (ex- MF Bunko J editor-in-charge)</p><br/><p></p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

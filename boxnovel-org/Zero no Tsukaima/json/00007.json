They were in the temple built close to Tarbes, Siesta\u2019s hometown. That was where the \u201cDragon\u2019s Raiment\u201d lay. Actually it would be more correct to say that the temple had been built to cover the Dragon\u2019s Raiment. The shape which Siesta\u2019s grandfather had built the temple into made Saito nostalgic. The temple was built in the corner of a field. Its door was made by logs joined together, and its walls were made from planks and mortar instead of stone. On top of an area of the wooden floor that was painted dark green, lay the Dragon\u2019s Raiment. Perhaps it was due to the permanence spell\u2026 but there were no signs of rusting. It was as if it had just been made.</p><br/><p>Kirche and Guiche looked at the Dragon\u2019s Raiment, dispirited. As if struck by curiosity, Tabitha looked at it with interest. Amazed, Saito stared at the Dragon\u2019s Raiment.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaito, are you ok? If I showed you anything to make you feel bad\u2026\u201d said Siesta in a worried voice.</p><br/><p>Saito didn\u2019t reply. He continued to gaze at the Dragon\u2019s Raiment as though he were deeply moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course this thing can\u2019t fly,\u201d said Kirche.</p><br/><p>Guiche nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is some sort of canoe right? And look at the wings, they can't even move. It\u2019s like toy bird or something. Not to mention that even the wings of small dragons are the size of these wings. Dragons and wyverns can only fly because they can flap their wings. So much for \u2018Dragon\u2019s Raiment\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Guiche pointed at the Dragon\u2019s Raiment and nodded, convinced that he was right.</p><br/><p>\u201cSaito\u2026 Are you really alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito grasped Siesta\u2019s shoulders as she was peering into his face. Saito spoke feverishly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSiesta.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid your grandfather leave behind anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 the only noteworthy things are his grave and a few of his belongings.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShow them to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The grave of Siesta\u2019s grandfather was located in the village cemetery. The tombstones were made from large white stones. Among them there was a tombstone made from a black stone, creating a clear contrast with the others.</p><br/><p>Words were inscribed on the tombstone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy grandfather made this tombstone before he died. It\u2019s written in a language from a different country, so no one has been able to read it. I wonder what it says\u2026\u201d said Siesta.</p><br/><p>Saito read it out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cNavy ensign Sasaki Takeo, rests in another world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Siesta\u2019s eyes widened at Saito, who read it fluently.</p><br/><p>Saito looked at Siesta feverishly, causing her to blush.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop\u2026 If you look at me like that\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Black hair, black pupils\u2026 This nostalgic feeling\u2026 So that\u2019s why, Saito thought, realizing why he was feeling nostalgic.</p><br/><p>\u201cSiesta, you were told that your hair and eyes were similar to your grandfather\u2019s right?\u201d Said Saito much to Siesta\u2019s surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-Yes! How did you know that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Returning to the temple, Saito touched the \u201cDragon\u2019s Raiment\u201d. When he did, the runes on the back of his left hand started to shine. <i>I see, so this must also be considered a \u201cweapon\u201d,</i> Saito thought as he looked at the machine guns sticking out from the wings. As the runes shone, the construction and the controls of the \"Dragon's Raiment\" came clearly to Saito. He could fly this himself, he thought.</p><br/><p>Saito found the fuel tank and opened it. Just as he expected, it was empty. No matter how well it was preserved, it still couldn\u2019t fly without gasoline. <i>I wonder how he had wandered into Halkeginia with this plane\u2026</i> Saito wanted to trace the trail, no matter what answer it would lead to.</p><br/><p>Siesta returned from her parent\u2019s home.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone was really surprised since I\u2019m two weeks earlier than I said I would be.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siesta excitedly handed over the item in her hands to Saito. They were old goggles, probably the ones her grandfather wore as a navy ensign. He was like the owner of the staff of destruction which Saito had used to defeat Fouquet\u2019s golem, someone from another world. A foreigner, like Saito.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather only left this behind. He didn\u2019t keep a diary or anything like that. But father said he left behind a will.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cA will?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. \u2018If someone who could read the inscription on the tomb appeared, give him the Dragon\u2019s Raiment\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeaning it\u2019s mine now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Father said it was alright to give it to you. It was a bother to take care of anyway\u2026 It\u2019s big and there are some people who worship it\u2026 but it\u2019s just collecting dust in this village.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I won\u2019t hesitate then,\u201d said Saito.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather also wanted me to tell you something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did he say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he wants you to return the Dragon\u2019s Raiment to the king. King\u2026 I wonder which king he means. We don\u2019t even know which country my grandfather is from\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s from my country,\u201d said Saito.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? So that\u2019s why you could read the words on the tombstone. Wow! I\u2019m kind of moved. My grandfather was from the same country as Saito. It seems like fate.\u201d Siesta said absentmindedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen grandfather really did come to Tarbes using the Dragon\u2019s Raiment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t called the Dragon\u2019s Raiment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it called in Saito\u2019s country?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the \u201cDragon\u2019s Raiment\u201d, Saito remembered a plastic model he put together when he was small. Why would someone call it the \"Dragon's Raiment\"? Perhaps it was just easier to understand that way. The same way it was with the \u201cstaff of destruction\u201d.</p><br/><p>He looked at the country\u2019s symbol drawn on the wings and the body of the place. A red dot. It seemed like it had white colored around it but it was covered by the same dark green paint used on the rest of it. The character for the dragon zodiac sign was written on the black cowling. It was probably the name of the unit he was in.</p><br/><p>Saito felt very nostalgic from merely seeing such an old thing from his own world.</p><br/><p>Saito replied, \u201cIt\u2019s called a Zero fighter. It was a fighter aircraft used in the past in my country.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZero fighter? Fighter aircraft?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, an airplane.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a plane? The one you mentioned before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito nodded.</p><br/><p>That day, they all stayed at Siesta\u2019s home. As nobles were staying over, even the village chief came to greet them. Siesta introduced Saito to her family, her father, mother and siblings. Siesta was the eldest daughter of the eight siblings. Her parents viewed Saito in a harsh light at first, but that was soon broken when Siesta told them that he was looking after her at the academy. Having not been home for a while, Siesta looked quite happy being surrounded by family. Saito was envious of her. When he thought about it, Louise, Kirche, Tabitha and Guiche all had families. He also had one, but he couldn\u2019t meet them like this. Even if he wanted to meet them, he didn\u2019t even know where to start.</p><br/><p>In the evening, Saito gazed out at the wide field. The sun was setting behind the mountains beyond the field. It was a huge field. Just as Siesta had said, flowers were blooming everywhere. <i>So this is the beautiful field that Siesta wanted to show me.</i></p><br/><p>The pilot who ended up in this world with the zero fighter probably tried to find a way home by flying in the sky\u2026 But his fuel ran out and he landed on this field. The field was flat and wide, so landing here was probably easy. He couldn\u2019t fly when he was asked to because he had run out of gasoline.</p><br/><p>Siesta came to Saito, who was still gazing at the field, drowned in the memories of his world. She was wearing a brown skirt, wooden shoes and a dark green cotton shirt, instead of her usual maid outfit. Like the field in front of him, her appearance was like that of the smell of sunlight.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you were here! Dinner\u2019s ready. Father insists we eat together.\u201d Said Siesta shyly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did ask you to come visit, but I didn\u2019t expect it to really happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siesta stretched both her arms out at the wide field before them. The setting sun bathed the field with a beautiful light.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t this field beautiful? This is what I wanted to show you, Saito.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Siesta then cast her eyes downwards and twiddled her fingers.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy father said that meeting with someone who came from the same country as grandfather must be fate. He asked if you could settle in the village. And then said if you did then I\u2026 could stop my work at the academy and return here with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito didn\u2019t reply. He just stared at the sky. He was thinking of how kind Siesta was to him. If she said any more nice things to him, his heart would probably melt. He felt lonely when he saw Siesta happily sitting and chatting with her family. After seeing the zero fighter, his homesickness grew much more intense.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Siesta looked at Saito who was still staring at the sky and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut, it\u2019s alright. I know it won\u2019t work out. You\u2019re like a bird. You\u2019re bound to fly away some day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito then decided to tell Siesta the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour grandfather said he came from the east, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026yes,\u201d Siesta said, slightly worried.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour grandfather, like I, wasn\u2019t born in this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou were born in Rub' al Khali in the east, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It is much, much further than that.\u201d Said Saito in a serious tone. \u201cIt\u2019s a different world. I\u2019m not from this world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re just playing around with me aren\u2019t you? If you don\u2019t like me, then just say it.\u201d Said Siesta, pouting her lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that at all. I\u2019m not playing around with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there someone waiting for you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. But my family is waiting. I'll someday have to leave this world for my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito turned to Siesta, and said weakly, \u201cThat\u2019s why I can\u2019t do the things you mentioned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito was very serious. Siesta knew he wasn\u2019t joking around.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can protect people with my power while I\u2019m here. But that\u2019s all. I don\u2019t have the right to reside with anyone. I don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut my grandfather did, didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour grandfather didn\u2019t have the power of Gand\u00e1lfr like I do. Up until now, there have been many enemies, but I\u2019ve defeated them with this power. I feel as though this power will guide me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 Can I wait for you? I don\u2019t have any qualities, but I can wait. If you try your best to find a way home and you still don\u2019t, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Siesta then became silent. <i>If that really happened, what would I do?</i> Saito thought. His pulse raced just by looking at Siesta. She was cute, and stunning without clothes on. She\u2019s kind and can even cook. She\u2019s a great girl. All the more reason why he couldn\u2019t promise her.</p><br/><p>Regaining herself, Siesta smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cA carrier owl just sent this. It seems like the teachers are very angry. Miss Zerbst and Mr. Gramont were pale. They mentioned me as well. They said that I could have a holiday for the time being. The princess\u2019s wedding is coming soon anyway. So until the holiday ends, I\u2019ll be here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 so can you make that Dragon\u2019s Raiment fly?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>With gasoline, probably,</i> thought Saito.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. I have to talk it over with someone first. If I do get it to fly, I want to go to the lands in the east. Your grandfather flew over from there, right? There must be some hint there.\u201d Said Saito, watching the setting sun.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally? If you could get it to fly, then it would be wonderful. The Dragon\u2019s Raiment was called a Zero fighter, right? If you get it to fly, then please let me ride it just once.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can let you ride it as many times as you like. It was your family\u2019s to begin with anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>The following morning, using a few of Guiche's dad's connections, Saito managed to obtain the services of a few dragoons and their dragons. They carried the zero fighter in a large net to the academy.</p><br/><p>Guiche initially wondered why they were carrying the useless \"Dragon's Raiment\", but because Saito insisted on it, he gave in. The costs of making a large net and calling the dragoons were ridiculously high. Saito was troubled because he obviously couldn\u2019t afford the transportation fees. However, as soon as the Zero fighter arrived in the courtyard of the academy, someone appeared in an instant and paid the fees. It was Mr Colbert.</p><br/><p></p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

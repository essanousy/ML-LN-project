Finally, the tenth book of Zero no Tsukaima. How great is that!</p><br/><p>Not just in anime, but in games and manga, it has spread in various ways in the world. I have been having this feeling of my work leaving my hands.</p><br/><p>I have seen many fan arts at the Net too. I feel it spreading, and it feels good. Similar to the universe, expansion is a good thing. Seemingly expanding like a bubble-shaped universe. Great Wall? Nah. An awesome universe.</p><br/><p>The theme of the 10th book is \u201chero\u201d. Who is \u201chero\u201d this word referring to? During my younger days, I thought of it as in games -Warriors wield swords; magi cast magic; priests heal injuries; bandits are quick- These easy-to-understand characters came into my mind, but a hero is neither. They have to wield swords, have to use magic\u2026\u2026So it is referring to people who do what?</p><br/><p>I thought \u2018hero\u2019 refers to the one who saves the world, but the warrior, priest, and magician \u2013aren\u2019t they part of the party which saves the world?</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>I thought about this. \u201cHero\u201d is the player himself, and because of his fame, he\u2019s a hero. That\u2019s because I have been pondering alone, playing games. However, I came to a sudden realization lately.</p><br/><p>A \u201chero\u201d refers to someone fortunate who is placed in a situation in which he can display his valor.</p><br/><p>That is not his occupation, but it is also not referring to someone brave. That's because there is no man on earth who does not possess courage.</p><br/><p>It cannot be helped, since that depends on each individual's interpretation. Generally, the moment a person is chosen by God was a hero, his journey as one begins.</p><br/><p>In short, a \u201chero\u201d is not the act of \u201cbecoming one\u201d, but the act of \u201cunintentionally becoming one\u201d, or \u201cunintentionally chosen as one\u201d.</p><br/><p>Chosen randomly by God, the compilation of courage-displaying people. That is the real form of a hero. Because he was \u201cunintentionally chosen\u201d like that, the courage which will be displayed, will be the real one, right? Or, doesn't it surpass the will of God?</p><br/><p>Such hero is a hero and is important, but a romantic comedy with cute girls -this is important too. Anyhow, if this thing doesn't exist, Japan will lose its international competitiveness. The main character has to be loved by all the other female characters- because that is the belief of this 21st century author, Noboru Yamaguchi, I want to continue this. I mean, because the characters- generally the heroines- are the instruments of my desire; in short, because I am writing this while in love, I cannot help but to do it. DISGUSTING? Don't talk nonsense! It's common knowledge. With that, that's all for Volume 10!</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Noboru Yamaguchi</p><br/><p></p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td> Back to</td><td> Return to</td><td> Forward to</td></tr></tbody></table><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

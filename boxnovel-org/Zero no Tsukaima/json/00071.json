Pentagon of the Five Elemental Powers, bless this humble being, and make him my familiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the living room of Tiffania's house, Contract Servant was completed.</p><br/><p>Though they searched in the forest\u2026 the woman in a black robe, who introduced herself as Sheffield, was gone. Only a large number of Alviss' were lying around.</p><br/><p>When Louise and the others returned to Tiffania\u2019s house\u2026 they decided to give another \"contract\" to Saito. If they were attacked again like a few moments ago, it might get serious after all.</p><br/><p>Siesta and Tiffania watched Saito's contracting with Louise with worried expressions. Agnes, with her arms crossed, was nonchalantly watching what the mage was doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess he's willing to become a mage\u2019s tool again. The runes make the sword training useless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Derflinger, who was leaning against the sofa, said in a somewhat painful voice. Agnes looked up at Derflinger surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy so gloomy. Isn\u2019t your partner coming back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not answering Agnes\u2019 question, Derflinger remained silent.</p><br/><p>Once the spell ended, Louise brought her lips to Saito\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Saito watched at her thin, but nicely shaped lips.</p><br/><p>When you think about it\u2026 everything started from here.</p><br/><p>Various adventures crossed his mind.</p><br/><p>After this, a new adventure might start from here. With his hopes and fears in turmoil, Saito stirred a little. Seeing Saito acting this way, Louise asked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t regret it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito, gazing straight into Louise\u2019s eyes, said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already decided it when I passed the gate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise nodded, and slowly pressed her lips against Saito\u2019s.</p><br/><p>At once\u2026 a burning pain hit his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cGuaaaaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>Siesta tried to run up to Saito, who was rolling in agony.</p><br/><p>\u201cS-Saito-san!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI-it\u2019s all right\u2026 it\u2019s just the runes of the familiar being carved in\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Both, Saito and Louise, said at the same time.</p><br/><p>And at once the pain subdued.</p><br/><p>Saito watched curves appearing on his left hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaah\u2026\u201d he moaned. Louise shut her eyes and pressed herself closer to Saito.</p><br/><p>\u201cD-did it fail?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 it succeeded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito showed Louise his left hand\u2019s top.</p><br/><p>Gand\u00e1lfr's runes were firmly carved.</p><br/><p>Louise gently traced each rune with her finger. <i>This character string\u2026 is a bond between me and Saito.</i> While caressing them\u2026 the amount of time when they were separated, the despair she felt, she was overflowed by the feelings.</p><br/><p>Though everyone were still there, Louise desperately clung tightly onto Saito\u2026 and buried her face below his chest. And stayed like that, not moving. Saito gently held Louise\u2019s shoulders.</p><br/><p>Everyone stared at the couple.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, as I said, I need to sharpen my sword for the battle,\u201d Agnes muttered.</p><br/><p>Though Siesta lifted up her eyes for a moment, she gave out a smile in the end.</p><br/><p>The innocent Tiffania blushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour left hand\u2026 don\u2019t stress it too much\u2026 I can\u2019t help but worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Derflinger muttered so silently that no one heard.</p><br/><p>The awkward atmosphere hung around for a while\u2026</p><br/><p>Tiffania, after saying, \u201cWell, I\u2019m sure you need various things to discuss,\u201d hurriedly dashed out of the bedroom.</p><br/><p>Siesta came up to Louise and muttered quietly in her ear.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Only for today, I will lend him to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026And left as fast as Tiffania left the room.</p><br/><p>When Derflinger tried to say something, he was gripped by Agnes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll right, you also have to go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally alone, Saito and Louise gazed at each other in silence.</p><br/><p>While they were looking at each other\u2026 tears started to fall from Louise\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLouise.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Saito unconsciously hugged her shoulders tighter, even more tears started to fall from her eyes. Not wiping them, Louise opened her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThth\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-thought I will never be able to meet you again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While looking straight at him Louise sobbed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I\u2026thought I, gu, had something important to t-t-tell, you, gu, went somewhere\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her speech overflowed with her feelings.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou didn't show up on the ship, you didn't show up in the bed, back at home\u2026 Do you know how worried I was?.. I couldn\u2019t take it anymore\u2026 I couldn\u2019t take it because\u2026\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Louise was heavily pulling out words mixed with tears. Though she was incoherent and hard to understand, Louise\u2019s feelings poured right into Saito\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut y-you visited me in my dreams\u2026 you were gentle, and, and\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cD-don\u2019t cry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito hugged Louise tightly, encircling her head with his hand. Louise started to weep more bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cCruel\u2026 You left me alone, cruel\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave,\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t leave you any more.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he said those words\u2026 he remembered how it hurt him so badly as well, since the runes disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon't go anywhere again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-stay by me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito nodded many times.</p><br/><p>The inside of his nose started to tickle.</p><br/><p><i>That\u2019s right, this is what I really wanted to do from the beginning.</i></p><br/><p><i>Since I was not Louise\u2019s Gand\u00e1lfr, though I wanted to protect her\u2026 I misunderstood. I thought that not being a Gand\u00e1lfr, I couldn't protect her.</i></p><br/><p><i>But, I was wrong.</i></p><br/><p><i>I can protect you, Louise.</i></p><br/><p><i>Not someone else, me\u2026 I want to protect you.</i></p><br/><p>As he thought this, something warm spread inside Saito\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>This warmth made Saito more determined.</p><br/><p><i>Some day, I might return.</i></p><br/><p><i>But\u2026 not until I make Louise happy.</i></p><br/><p><i>For the master who needs me so much, I will pursue her dreams.</i></p><br/><p>When he was determined like that, everything seemed simple.</p><br/><p>Louise was still crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you can look at other girls\u2026 You can touch them\u2026 You can k-k-k-kiss them, but\u2026 don\u2019t go anywhere\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise kept on crying for a while.</p><br/><p>Louise, who finished crying some time ago and now had red and puffy eyes, was silent.</p><br/><p>When he laid her down in bed, she laid down obediently. Yet, she gripped onto Saito\u2019s sleeve and did not let it go. And pulled it down while biting her lips. So, Saito had to lie down next to her. Louise immediately placed her head gently on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>He could smell the nostalgic aroma of Louise\u2019s hair.</p><br/><p>Louise silently drew her lips to Saito's ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cW-what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito asked looking at her burning eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-yes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTill the morning breaks, be gentle.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the middle of this intimate\u2026 dangerous atmosphere, Saito stroked Louise\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Ngh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise leaked out a moan.</p><br/><p>Such an act from Louise made Saito almost die on the spot.</p><br/><p><i>What I want to do, I cannot do.</i> What about the others, who are in a room next to theirs?</p><br/><p>So, Saito torn by such conflict, desperately endured\u2026 until Louise said in an angry tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou put your tongue in that maid\u2019s mouth, didn\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p><i>It wasn\u2019t really me putting it in, but Siesta\u2026</i></p><br/><p>But saying that makes no difference, at least when your opponent is Louise.</p><br/><p>Oh no, he will be punched! Or maybe kicked!</p><br/><p>Guard! Guard guard!</p><br/><p>Saito frantically tried to protect his groin, after hearing Louise saying that in a sulky voice. Neither a kick, nor a slap followed.</p><br/><p>Instead, a bullet of pink flew and knocked Saito down.</p><br/><p>Louise, with a blush on her cheeks, lifted her moist eyes up to Saito and said in a sulky voice,</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to have the same thing to gloss over.\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Alright?</i></p><br/><p><i>Not alright?</i></p><br/><p>The switch was triggered.</p><br/><p>\"Alright.\"</p><br/><p>Saito framed her face with his hands, and, in trance, pressed his mouth against hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cNh\u2026\u201d Louise closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>Taking the opportunity, his hand sneaked beneath her shirt and touched her breast. However, Louise Fran\u00e7oise did not show any of the resistance she had a while ago in the shallop.</p><br/><p><i>Why doesn\u2019t she?</i></p><br/><p><i>Maybe this is a dream?</i></p><br/><p><i>How do I confirm that?</i></p><br/><p>\u201cAh, indeed. If one feels pain, then one can\u2019t be sleeping!\u201d</p><br/><p><i>Well, to feel pain, I only need Louise to hit me.</i></p><br/><p><i>Hm, what should I do to make her hit me?</i></p><br/><p><i>Ah, say bad words!</i></p><br/><p>Saito, lost in his excitement, said, pressing his hand against her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this a breast?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sweet atmosphere disappeared immediately.</p><br/><p>It was as if someone chanted Dispel Magic and blew it off like smoke\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Slap.</p><br/><p>Louise\u2019s palm slapped him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYup\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre my breasts bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Slap slap.</p><br/><p>Her palm continued to hit.</p><br/><p>Slap slap slap.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are flat and no good.\u201d</p><br/><p>He muttered in a silent voice as Louise\u2019s palm continued to slap him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAaah\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The pain helped him to realize that it was reality.</p><br/><p>So, this was not a dream.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>But\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, stop, I was wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Slap slap slap slap slap slap.</p><br/><p>Weren\u2019t there other ways to confirm whether it was a dream or not? He realized too late.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait. T-they are small but firm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHold your tongue!\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise\u2019s knee flew up.</p><br/><p>As it hit straight into his belly; Saito fainted.</p><br/><p>In Tiffania's bedroom, Siesta was sleeping on the bed. A jar of wine was rolling next to her.</p><br/><p>Tiffania, leaving Siesta, took her harp and went out of the room.</p><br/><p>Sitting on a chair in the courtyard, Tiffania began to play the harp.</p><br/><p>And the sounds of the Founder's homesickness\u2026 melted with the night wind and wrapped Westwood Village up.</p><br/><p>Agnes sat on a chair of in the living room, drinking sake.</p><br/><p>She heard the sounds of a harp coming from the courtyard.</p><br/><p>Agnes closed her eyes and submerged herself into Tiffania\u2019s performance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, Commander-san?\u201d</p><br/><p>Asked Derflinger, who she had as her drinking partner. Agnes opened her eyes.</p><br/><p>Instead of the usual musketeer commander\u2019s steel, one could see a girl's anxiety in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 I just recalled my hometown. I can\u2019t return there\u2026 such a useless memory.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t return there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Self-mockingly, Agnes murmured,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist anymore. It exists only in the corner of my memories.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Derflinger said\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? A hometown is just a word. Find a new hometown.\u201d</p><br/><p>Agnes became silent and continued listening to the tune, settled, in the course of time; a gentle smile appeared on her face and she nodded.</p><br/><p>Louise watched the unconscious Saito, who had started a journey into the world of sleep. <i>If only he had not made that remark about my breast size,</i> she thought passionately\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Melody?\u201d</p><br/><p>She noticed a tune playing outside the window.</p><br/><p>Who?</p><br/><p>Was that Tiffania?</p><br/><p>Somehow, she started to feel nostalgic. While listening to the sounds\u2026 Louise recalled the other Void user.</p><br/><p>Then felt uneasy\u2026</p><br/><p>That Myoznitnirn from before\u2026</p><br/><p>Though she could not understand why, she seemed to aim at Louise.</p><br/><p>This Void\u2019s familiar was not an ally\u2026</p><br/><p>And if there are Void familiars besides Saito, then there should be Void users as well\u2026</p><br/><p>It was an unknown, big flow of events. <i>I myself, am only driftwood in this big flow.</i></p><br/><p>But\u2026 looking at the familiar breathe in his sleep, Louise thought\u2026</p><br/><p><i>I have Saito.</i></p><br/><p><i>At that time, it was Saito who saved me.</i></p><br/><p><i>Aye, I may be just driftwood in a rapid stream. But\u2026 I am tightly tied with a rope.</i></p><br/><p>She thought\u2026</p><br/><p>The whole \"noble pride\" thing was long ago rooted out of Louise.</p><br/><p>She wanted to use her God given powers on far more important things. Like\u2026 for the clueless familiar.</p><br/><p>Louise quietly whispered to Saito.</p><br/><p><i>First of all, I\u2019ll look for the way to bring you home.</i></p><br/><p>At that moment, she did not say those important words.</p><br/><p>If she did\u2026 Saito would be chained to her by those words.</p><br/><p>Sounds of harp continued.</p><br/><p><i>\u2026This Tiffania, just who is she?</i></p><br/><p>She looked like she was hiding something deep inside.</p><br/><p>And she cured Saito\u2019s near-to-death injuries.</p><br/><p><i>Tomorrow, I\u2019ll ask for details\u2026</i> Louise closed her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cN\u2026\u201d Stirring, Saito woke up.</p><br/><p>Next to him Louise was sleeping.</p><br/><p>Her face, pressed closely against Saito\u2019s chest, looked relaxed as she continued to sleep.</p><br/><p>Seeing Louise like that\u2026 reminded him of a beautiful girl, carrying Elfin blood.</p><br/><p>She, like Louise, was a Void user. Still, he\u2019d have to talk about this with Louise. <i>Tomorrow, I will speak with her,</i> Saito thought.</p><br/><p>On the other side of window, under the moonlight\u2026 he heard the half-elf girl, Tiffania, playing her harp.</p><br/><p>On the other day, when he heard these sounds, he was reminded of his hometown, and it was painful\u2026</p><br/><p>But now it was different.</p><br/><p>Because Louise\u2019s head rested on his chest.</p><br/><p>Something dear spread in his heart.</p><br/><p>Even though dawn started to break\u2026 Tiffania's playing continued.</p><br/><p>The serenade of dreaming lovers echoed throughout the forest near Saxe-Gotha, soothing its listeners and healing their hearts.</p><br/><p></p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

He had now somewhat straightened up his feelings on the things he had to do.</p><br/><p>Thinking about this and that, Saito was gazing at the ceiling\u2026</p><br/><p>*Knock knock*</p><br/><p>Someone knocked against the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d Answered Louise\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026it\u2019s open.\u201d He said in an ill-tempered voice, and with an awkward expression on her face, Louise stepped in.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcuse me. Just in case, I came to check. Are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 hit me more than enough already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise pouted and said in a sulky tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you were the one who was wrong. You said you love me only as a familiar. I-it was a lie wasn\u2019t it? Truly. You love me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>She sounded almost desperate.</p><br/><p>Saito glared at Louise and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a thing can be said to anyone. As a noble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cS-still, you love me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t dislike you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that the opposite? Aren\u2019t you the one who likes me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-n-n-n-n-n-no way!\u201d</p><br/><p>Blushing Louise, whirled her hands fast.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, were you not this jealous because you love me? And you even amassed your willpower so quickly because you were angry I was kissed. It\u2019s so obvious.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUuuuuh\u201d Louise let out a half-sobbing groan and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Really. It might be so.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201d Surprised, Saito stared at Louise. Seeing him like this, Louise once again gave a triumphant \u2018nya\u2019 smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way. The dog is drooling again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you cheated!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you got all \u2018dokidoki\u2019 from that. Idiot.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito turned to the other side to hide his embarrassment and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally\u2026 I\u2019ll just gradually find a way to return home. And then I will definitely drink miso soup.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is miso soup?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy country\u2019s soup.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Then Louise gently said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI too would like to drink soup from Saito\u2019s country.\u201d</p><br/><p>Saito\u2019s cheek turned redder than from a kiss.</p><br/><p>Louise became embarrassed as well and turned the other way.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt may be very difficult, however\u2026 for the moment, the way things are, I would like for you to continue helping us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Though she said it calmly, Louise was burning with emotion on the inside.</p><br/><p><i>Surely after all this, Saito will deny such a pledge with curses. </i></p><br/><p><i>\u2018Why should I do such a thing?\u2019</i></p><br/><p><i>Why doesn\u2019t Saito say such words.</i></p><br/><p>That time\u2026 he saved her from Fouquet\u2019s golem.</p><br/><p>And that day, he came to Louise\u2019s rescue again\u2026</p><br/><p>That\u2019s why behind his snappish words, Louise felt Saito\u2019s love. And then, when he went through Tiffania\u2019s spell\u2026 It wasn\u2019t a familiar\u2019s affection, but genuine love.</p><br/><p><i>However, why do I still doubt? That it isn\u2019t given by a familiar magic? Why can\u2019t I get rid of this fear? </i></p><br/><p><i>\u2026because I am still not confident in myself.</i></p><br/><p><i>Because I am not confident, I refuse to accept my feelings and doubt Saito's words. Therefore, all I can say are such things</i> \u2013 while thinking so, Louise shyly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI-I am being manipulated too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hold affection for my familiar as well. That\u2019s why I felt such burning jealousy, even though I did not want to. Really.\u201d</p><br/><p>Louise placed her palms on both of Saito's cheeks and suddenly brought her lips close to his.</p><br/><p>\u201cEh? Eeh? Nmh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Two pair of lips slowly melted with each other.</p><br/><p>Gently tracing Saito\u2019s lips with her own, Louise thought absent mindedly while kissing.</p><br/><p><i>When I used Void, why was I so angry?</i></p><br/><p><i>Was it because\u2026 Saito did that with another girl? Apparently, it recharged real fast. What an annoying willpower</i> \u2013 Louise thought.</p><br/><p><i>Besides I got angry from the bottom of my heart.</i></p><br/><p><i>It was hateful, it was painful\u2026 however, there was nothing I could do\u2026</i></p><br/><p>Louise\u2019s lips kissed the corner of his mouth before pressing themselves hard against his lips again.</p><br/><p>After continuing kissing him wildly for a while\u2026 Louise suddenly pulled her lips away from his, catching her breath.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cPoor me - I have been manipulated by the Void to feel an attraction towards my familiar. I am such a poor girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying those words, Louise leaned in and passionately recaptured his lips again.</p><br/><p>While kissing her lips repeatedly\u2026 Saito understood that Louise\u2019s words were a lie.</p><br/><p>It was painfully obvious.</p><br/><p>Louise\u2019s kisses were increasingly feverish and hot.</p><br/><p>Hot because her feelings for Saito were spoken out loud.</p><br/><p>The moment he saw the lower half of the Albion continent covered by a white cloud from their ship, Saito mused.</p><br/><p><i>Was\u2026 Tiffania\u2019s magic really effective against me?</i></p><br/><p>Originally this \u2018Fake motive\u2019 might have been nothing more than, in Cattleya\u2019s words, \u2018the locked mind\u2019.</p><br/><p>Well, when he thought about it, it may have been just showing off Saito's natural optimism.</p><br/><p>Something that even your own heart is not aware off.</p><br/><p>However, he knew one thing for sure.</p><br/><p>Looking at Louise always made his heart beat fast. Even Tiffania\u2019s magic could not change that \u2013 it still remained the same.</p><br/><p>Saito recalled a dream he saw in Tiffania\u2019s house.</p><br/><p>That time, Saito\u2019s mother had asked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you forgotten something?\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, the meaning of a man\u2019s existence, was to protect the girl that made his heart beat hard.</p><br/><p>Even at the cost of his life.</p><br/><p>That was all that there was to it.</p><br/><p>That was what Saito thought, inside the ship drifting further away from Albion, and continuing to exchange passionate kisses with Louise.</p><br/><p></p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td> Back to</td><td> Return to</td><td> Forward to</td></tr></tbody></table><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

Each person wore the same style of garb resembling that of monks\u2019, with draped cloaks that made them indistinguishable from one another.</p><br/><p>The group of travelers arrived at a site: the mountain pass. In nearby regions law and order was in great chaos, for brigands would often come here and cause trouble. It was between the countries\u2019 borders where bandits and gangs could make the most of their talents. They raided travelers crossing the border and seized their wealth. When successful, they simply escaped into the neighboring country, yet even if officers captured the criminals, the officers often found they had no authority to prosecute them .</p><br/><p>As a result, merchants and travelers armed themselves to the teeth and hired bodyguards when time came to cross the border.</p><br/><p>Although times were tough, monks were not commonly robbed. One reason may be that harming a monk would be asking for divine retribution, evoking the contempt of the Gods, but the main reason was that there was no profit to be made from robbing one.</p><br/><p>Today, however, the feral wolves seemed especially hungry.</p><br/><p>Just shortly after treading into a place filled with thick vegetation, the group of monks was surrounded by ten gang members. The criminals possessed all sorts of weapons, from swords to pikes, even firearms.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monks, their path blocked, had no choice but to hold their horses. A man holding a sword approached, commanding everyone to dismount completely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do we have to dismount?\u201d the leading monk asked. The bandits burst into noisy laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally it\u2019s because that thing can net us some cash!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, you just want money, correct?\u201d Spoken in an obviously Halkeginian language, Gallian, but with a distinct accent mixed in.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bet, \u2018cause in order to make money, we brothers bust our asses to do business in this area.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a tone unfazed, a nun within the group unexpectedly responded: \u201cBusiness? I\u2019ll ask, is stealing from others like you are now doing to us your business? Have you received approval of this activity? Do you pay taxes to the government?\u201d</p><br/><p>The brigands heard the beautiful voice of a woman, and their eyes brightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, over there, let me see your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>The leading monk upon hearing this, held his breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop; if you want money I\u2019ll give it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He subsequently reached within his robes, fished out a small pouch and threw it onto the ground. A bandit pounced on it, and immediately let out a cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens, it\u2019s gold sand, and so much of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, we would like to leave.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>The monks tried to move forward, but the brigands again blocked the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. Us brothers are indeed hard-working, and our style is to grab everything we can get a hold of. Leave us your horses, and the woman too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no choice. I guess we\u2019ll just help ourselves.\"</p><br/><p>The bandit walked towards whom he suspected was the nun.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me see; what kind of goods do you really have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he attempted to place his hand on the woman, the monk leader gravely warned the bandit.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you dare touch her cloak, you will die. You only live once, so I advise you if you still treasure your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>The brigands went hysterical.</p><br/><p>\u201cProve you monks will be able to catch us!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bandit used a pointed end (of his weapon <b>(!)</b>) to ruffle the nun\u2019s cloak. Underneath the cloth, there appeared a woman\u2019s face with the beauty of a fairy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah, this girl will sell for a high price!\u201d</p><br/><p>Every brigand had a cheerful expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cI gotta say, have you killed people before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Next to the nun, one monk, who up until now had said nothing, asked suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah. About once a month or so, hmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was speaking, the bandit pulled the cloak off the nun entirely.</p><br/><p>\u201c . . . Huh?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he saw what had previously been hidden under the cloak, the man\u2019s thoughts numbed.</p><br/><p><i>Long ears . . . not a human trait. Oh, right, this characteristic belongs to a certain race . . .</i></p><br/><p><i>What is it?</i></p><br/><p><i>Supposedly, they\u2019re a people both strong and beautiful . . .</i></p><br/><p>It\u2019s a pity that man couldn't come to a final conclusion because a branch flew noiselessly into his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019re elves!\u201d the member with the pike cried out.</p><br/><p>The monk leader . . . Ali, repeated the incantation.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh forest branches, become arrows sharp, enemies will cry, through their bodies fly.\u201d .</p><br/><p>Responding to the spell, a nearby branch snapped off like a toothpick and became a high speed arrow aimed at the bandit who just shouted. The arrow launched into his mouth and emerged from the base of his skull (cervical vertebrae, back neck area).</p><br/><p>The two brigands who held fire guns . . . aimed at the elves and pulled their triggers.</p><br/><p>Defending both sides Luctiana, the gracefully postured elf, had long been preparing a spell.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh wind and air, heed my call, a shield around me, form a wall.\u201d .</p><br/><p>The air shield received and deflected the bullets, flicking them far away with a loud pop. Upon seeing this, the brigands scattered, fleeing in all directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cEl---elves are here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ali shook his head somewhat disapprovingly (sadly? disappointed?).</p><br/><p>\u201cOh forest branches long, reach to bind my foes strong.\u201d .</p><br/><p>Numerous outstretched branches coiled around the hands and feet of the brigands.</p><br/><p>The rest of the sharp arrow branches flew around, homing in on the brigands\u2019 throats or their stomachs in order to stab them.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>After a few brief seconds, all was quiet once again. Using the same skill demonstrated in manipulating the branches, Ali moved the corpses into the deepest part of the forest, and soon after he again used earth magic to quickly bury the bodies.</p><br/><p>When he was done with everything, Ali began to reprimand Luctiana.</p><br/><p>\u201cI tell you Luctiana! What were you thinking back there? How can someone ask those kind of questions?!\u201d</p><br/><p>In contrast, Luctiana looked like she could care less.</p><br/><p>\u201cWha? If we have questions, no matter what we go and ask them; that\u2019s our duty as scholars.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally! Even if someone happens to be a savage murder, taking his life doesn\u2019t make me feel warm and fuzzy inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, next time I\u2019ll be more careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, you have to. If we\u2019re traveling by sea, we really wouldn\u2019t have so much trouble, right? I\u2019m not saying land travel is time-consuming, but it\u2019s still very dangerous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, think: if we came by sea, there wouldn\u2019t be anything to sightsee along the way. A trip where we constantly stare at the unchanging water surface; I can only imagine the insufferable horror. A big ocean is even more boring than a desert.\u201d</p><br/><p>Luctiana spoke without reservation, and a male elf next to her laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo at this rate, we\u2019ll never figure out who\u2019ll be the team leader. Ali, Your Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean, Edolis? <b>(!)</b> Without a doubt, Luctiana is the team leader here. We are merely servants accompanying Miss High and Mighty on her journey.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ali now finished with his bitter words, Luctiana once again yelled excitedly,</p><br/><p>\u201cAwesome! This lady can boss you around! Glorious people of the desert, we are the noble, chosen race responsible for protecting the world. Onwards! Objective: Kingdom of Tristainia, Des, Des, Des . . .\u201d</p><br/><p>The name was on the tip of her tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Des Orni\u00e8res,\u201d</p><br/><p>Ali rushed to inform her.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeriously . . . the names these barbarians come up with are real tongue twisters; doesn\u2019t matter if they\u2019re names of a person or a place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a scholar?\u201d Ali couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>Listening, Edolis <b>(!)</b> and another elf beside him, Matalf <b>(!)</b>, started laughing together.</p><br/><p>The desert elves, having covered themselves with their cloaks, followed the open road and traveled onwards.</p><br/><p></p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\"><tbody><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><div><div></div></div><br/>\n</div>"}

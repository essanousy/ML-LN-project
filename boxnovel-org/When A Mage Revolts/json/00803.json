On this island, there were three villages, and after all the shamans and elders had been eliminated, the guards left behind did not know what to do, and so naturally, no one could stop them from getting onto the ship.</p><br/><p>As for the villagers who chose to follow Benjamin, most of them came from the first village.</p><br/><p>A total of three hundred people, more or less, had chosen to follow him, and this was a rather large proportion. They might not really understand what Benjamin\u2019s words meant, but, judging by their expressions, there were things in their hearts that were beginning to awaken.</p><br/><p>Muddling along in their lives under a theocratic rule, it was the first time that they were realizing, in this world\u2026 There might be another way of living.</p><br/><p>As for the other two villages, they had not seen with their own eyes the scene in which Benjamin killed all the shamans, and an atheist speech was not persuasive to them. Those people only knew that there had been enemies attacking from the outside, but they had not even seen the face of the Church, so how could they come to the realization of anything?</p><br/><p>Because of that, Benjamin did not intend to bring them along.</p><br/><p>\"It is impossible for us to rescue everyone, this is their own decision,\" He stood on the deck, watching and consoling the siblings as they kept on gazing towards the islands on the stern of the ship.</p><br/><p>The young girl turned her head, \"Them staying there\u2026 What will happen?\"</p><br/><p>\"Probably die,\" Benjamin shrugged, saying, \"There are many magical creatures being kept by plenty of people on the island, and now that the worshippers from across the sea have been completely destroyed, the magical creatures will soon go out of control, and the people left there will have no power to fight back.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are we really going to just leave them there to die\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s their own choice,\" Benjamin sighed, saying, \"To die for their faith is what they desire, so they are getting what they wish for. There\u2019s nothing we can do.\"</p><br/><p>According to his estimations, the population of the entire sea tribe was about a thousand to two, and most of them were at the bottom of the social hierarchy, living life in a daze. Even if they left, they might not be able to get used to the life on land. If there was no courage to start over, perhaps staying on the island, believing the lies concerning the goddess and dying like that might be a better choice for them.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, these approximately three hundred people were already the maximum of what Benjamin could handle.</p><br/><p>If there were more people, it would be very difficult to handle them when they had been brought out. After all, his main objective for coming this time was not to set these islanders free, but to obtain the psychic books that belonged to the worshippers from across the sea.</p><br/><p>The information concerning psychic powers were basically all stored up in the altars. Because of that, after Benjamin had been done with the matters in the village, he had, naturally, flown towards the altar at his highest speed. Of course, there were still some shamans and guards at the altars, standing guard and not having a clue about the situation outside; Benjamin got rid of them easily.</p><br/><p>Following that, all of the precious books fell, unharmed, into Benjamin\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t think so much, go back and take a look at the books we\u2019ve gotten from the altar,\" Thinking that, Benjamin patted the two siblings\u2019 shoulders, advising as such.</p><br/><p>The two siblings nodded and turned around to go back to the cabin.</p><br/><p>The content of the books they had obtained was actually extremely complicated. A lot of things were not explained in detail, and the worshippers from across the sea did not compile a complete system of theories. Because of that, it was only through the two siblings, having been born as psychic spellcasters to shamans, that the books could be slowly arranged.</p><br/><p>However, without a doubt, no matter how messy things got, these books were able to be of great assistance to the two siblings. Given more time, Benjamin believed that one day, these two people would grow to be even stronger than their elders.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the psychic education in the academy was about to get on track.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, other than the books, Benjamin had also obtained a few unexpected items from the altar.</p><br/><p>\"These stone slates, the things inscribed on them should be runes, yes?\" He returned to the cabin and took out a few extremely ancient grey stone slates. His fingers traced the runes on them, and he asked the question in his heart.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s right,\" The system answered, \"The interesting part is that these are all very rare runes, and even the way they are arranged, I feel like there is some sort of special meaning to it.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded, asking, \"Are you saying that the stone slates not only record runes but also rune sentences that have been put together?\"</p><br/><p>\"It is possible.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then\u2026 May I try to activate it?\"</p><br/><p>The System\u2019s voice was full of sarcasm and an eagerness to see something bad happening, \"You can try!\"</p><br/><p>Because of it, Benjamin\u2019s curiosity was extinguished quite a fair bit. He calmed down and examined those few stone slates for a while, before finally putting them away carefully.</p><br/><p>It was better to bring them back to the academy for the professionals to research on them. In the past, it had always been him acting out of too much enthusiasm that ended him up in a lot of unexpected troubles and, on some occasions, almost killing himself. To be honest, he was considered really lucky to still be living now.</p><br/><p>Because of that, at the System\u2019s reminder, he decided to be more cautious this time.</p><br/><p>Whatever it was, he had earned a lot on his trip out at sea this time. Not only had he suppressed the Church\u2019s arrogance by borrowing their hands to destroy the worshippers from across the sea, but he had even acquired all of the wealth of the worshippers from across the sea, as well as the heart of a soul, the usage of which was unclear for now. Benjamin was extremely satisfied.</p><br/><p>Also, what made things even better was that the people the Church had sent over had been killed, so the Kingdom of Helius would be getting no news at all. Because of this, Grant would not realize that all of this was the work of Benjamin.</p><br/><p>They could even be misled, and make more mistakes.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, at Havenwright, St. Peter\u2019s Cathedral.</p><br/><p>\"Your Highness the Pope, everyone\u2019s crosses have been broken, the operation of the crusade against the worshippers from across the sea has failed,\" Suddenly, a shaman walked hurriedly into the main hall, reporting as he lowered his head.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Grant did not turn his head, but stared at the murals on the ceiling above him, unmoving.</p><br/><p>\"...I need an explanation.\"</p><br/><p>The shaman took a deep breath to relieve the nervousness in his heart, and answered quietly, \"Before the destruction of the troop, we did not receive any news, so we have to send people over to check on the situation before we can know what happened.\"</p><br/><p>\"So\u2026 How about the king?\"</p><br/><p>\"He is still the same, sometimes well, sometimes not. The curse planted by those people is very difficult to break, and the protesting nobles have increased in number. Your Highness, we might need to prepare some backup plans now.\"</p><br/><p>Grant turned around, \"Such as?\"</p><br/><p>The shaman, being stared down at by him, felt a sudden surge of pressure exerted on him, and could not help but gulp before replying slowly, \"That\u2026 We can use a substitute.\"</p><br/><p>Grant let out a derisive laugh.</p><br/><p>The shaman was becoming more anxious, \"Your Highness the Pope...\"</p><br/><p>\"Do you think that a substitute would be able to trick those people\u2019s eyes?\" Grant\u2019s tone of voice had become very cold, \"Within the city walls, every noble that walks into the church has to bow respectfully towards us, and speak those neverending, flattering words. But, are you unable to see that they have cursed at us in their hearts over thousands of times? How can they let go of this opportunity so easily?\"</p><br/><p>The shaman hurriedly lowered his head, \"The majesty of God is unsurpassable, how would the nobles dare commit the offence.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Grant gave a scoff, and cast a few glances casually at the shaman, revealing a disinterested expression.</p><br/><p>\"Go back and continue to send troops beyond the sea. A group of deep-sea banshee followers, I do not believe that they are able to turn any tide.\" He said impatiently, \"As for a substitute\u2026 You may begin preparations.\"</p><br/><p>The shaman, as though been granted a huge pardon, hurriedly nodded, and turned around to leave the main hall.</p><br/><p>\"... Wait.\"</p><br/><p>Grant suddenly stopped him.</p><br/><p>\"Your Highness the Pope, what other instructions do you have for me?\" The shaman turned back in a rush, asking in fear and sincerity.</p><br/><p>\"Do not tell anyone about the failure of the cleansing of the worshippers across the sea,\" Grant suddenly became so solemn, it was shocking. He spoke in a low voice, \"Especially bishop Connor and bishop Engel. Tell them everything went according to plan, do not let them know of a single word we\u2019ve spoken today.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the shaman nodded like a chick pecking at grains.</p><br/><p>\"Of course!\"</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Grant waved his hand and dismissed the shaman out from the great doors. The doors closed up, and following that, the entire main hall fell into silence once again, leaving Grant alone.</p><br/><p>He turned around and looked up at the ceiling.</p><br/><p>It was a very typical piece of religious artwork. The strict lines and the mechanical colors merged together, forming two opposing, yet extremely similar faces. The people in the painting were confronting each other in a dark cave; one of them was surrounded by pure, white light, and the other was drawn to have red eyes, with horns on his head, like the living devil.</p><br/><p>The decisive battle of Cain and Abel. This was probably the most classical piece of material for religious art.</p><br/><p>Looking at this painting, Grant suddenly squinted his eyes, showing displeasure.</p><br/><p>\"No one can control my fate.\"</p><br/><p>He suddenly spoke, as though speaking to himself, but also to someone unseen there. His voice reverberated in the empty main hall. The atmosphere was strange.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As guardians of a very important person, they should always be alert and focused, dressed in full armor to protect the underground room properly. Suddenly taking his helmet off? What was this about?</p><br/><p>Benjamin's face had been carefully disguised, so no one recognized him.</p><br/><p>Thus, it was only when the water elemental domain had been suddenly spread out, and layers of waves had appeared to envelope all of them completely, did they look extremely shocked.</p><br/><p>\"You, you are\u2026\"</p><br/><p>At first, the priest opened his mouth, stammering, as though he wanted to say something. Benjamin did not give him the opportunity, however. He clapped his hands, and in a flash, the turbulent rush of water spun into a whirlpool, dragging everyone inside it.</p><br/><p>The two priests and five Holy Knights did not stand a chance in the whirlpool. Not even for a second.</p><br/><p>Very soon, seven corpses, soaking wet, were left at the door of the underground room. Benjamin did not give them a second look. He turned his head and immediately summoned the water elemental sprite.</p><br/><p>The underground room containing the King was right before his eyes, only\u2026 There was still an incredibly strong Holy Barrier.</p><br/><p>\"Break through this barrier!\" He immediately commanded the sprite.</p><br/><p>The sprite fluttered its wings and flew up, raising a delicate arm. Water elements gathered in its hand, and following that, there was a woosh; a blue beam of light pierced right through the Holy Barrier in front of it.</p><br/><p>The Holy Barrier shattered like glass, disintegrating into thin air.</p><br/><p>Benjamin immediately rushed down the underground room.</p><br/><p>From the moment he had used magic, he knew that the magic oscillation would ripple out and alert the entire cathedral. Time was of the essence. He needed to get the King out as fast as he could.</p><br/><p>He kicked the door to the underground room open, and Benjamin saw a middle-aged man, standing rooted to the spot.</p><br/><p>\"W-what\u2026\"</p><br/><p>This other person was obviously shocked by his arrival; his body was trembling, and there was fear in his eyes. Right after the System called out. He could not afford to explain everything at leisure here.</p><br/><p>Carrying the King, Benjamin speedily flew out of the underground room and tried to go through the corridor so that he could fly right out the open air courtyard and out of the cathedral. However, at that moment, approximately a dozen figures appeared around the corner of the corridor right in front of them, and were flying towards Benjamin in unison.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the bricks making up the walls of the entire corridor began to shine.</p><br/><p>\"Wow, they've come so quickly,\" The System suddenly exclaimed. \"This is definitely a trap. They must've known you would appear, otherwise it's impossible for them to arrive so soon!\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin's heart sank as well.</p><br/><p>However, as always, he was not overly panicked. Grant was not there, and he had already identified who the dozen of people were: Bishops. These were definitely within his ability to handle. Only, there were so many Bishops gathered here, and as they rushed towards Benjamin, they glared furiously at him, and did not look at all surprised.</p><br/><p>They were obviously prepared for this.</p><br/><p>\"Elemental Order- Damage,\" With no time to think things through carefully, a string of runes appeared with a jerk of Benjamin's hand, and he threw them towards the other side.</p><br/><p>However, he only realized that something was wrong the moment the runes formed. The water elements had begun to gather under the effects of the runes, but for some reason, they were gathering four to five times slower than the usual speed, as though some force had suddenly materialized in the air to suppress the flow of the elements, causing them to immediately become slow.</p><br/><p>Also\u2026</p><br/><p>\"The flow of light elements is quickening, and the flow of all other types of elements is slowing down,\" The System gloated, \"You are super unlucky this time. This cathedral\u2026 Seems to have been built as a complete magical instrument in itself.\"</p><br/><p>There was an instant alert in Benjamin's heart.</p><br/><p>Every brick in the corridor seemed to be shining, swallowing up every inch of space. It was this light that seemed to be at work, and also weakening the elemental turbulence several times over!</p><br/><p>Opposite of him, holy light had surrounded the sides of the dozens of bishops. Beams of light gathered together to form a huge circle of light, which was jumping right at him, enveloping the water elements that had just been collected by the runes. With a poof, the elemental turbulence, which had not yet taken form, was completely disintegrated by it!</p><br/><p>\"You cause your own demise by daring to come here today!\" The voices of the bishops sounded as though the anger they had been suppressing for a long time was finally changing into glee.</p><br/><p>Right after that, something even more unexpected happened: Runes representing the light elements suddenly flashed in the eyes of those bishops, before chains of Holy Light crystallized in front of them, one after another.</p><br/><p>They did not chant. They had cast their spells directly.</p><br/><p>This was the most significant feature of having learnt the Law of Runes and Meditation.</p><br/><p>It was not that Benjamin had never thought of such a situation. It would not have been too difficult for the spies of the Church to obtain the Law, once it had spread. He was only taken aback that the internal bishops had learnt the entire Law so quickly.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, more than ten Holy Light chains had crystallized, and surged towards him all at once, at a momentum so powerful that it resembled oil paintings where god was about to imprison sinners. Seeing that, Benjamin could only draw the triangular runes; the water elemental sprite crashed into them, and the deep sea domain was activated immediately.</p><br/><p>After a buzzing sound, blue ripples spread out, and runes were scattered all over like stars in the sky; the light shining in the corridor was finally dispersed and pushed out of the domain.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Benjamin could even feel his breathing becoming easier.</p><br/><p>The Holy Light chains rushed into the deep sea domain. The huge amounts of water elements did not need Benjamin's instructions; instantly, they surged over, and the surface of the chains, glowing with golden light, began to show signs of frost.</p><br/><p>The flying speed of the chains decreased immediately as well.</p><br/><p>Benjamin waved his hand, and the deep sea domain abruptly turned into a frost domain. A sudden blizzard swept into the narrow corridor, and great gusts of wind carrying bits of tiny and sharp snowflakes within them, gliding about like huge darts.</p><br/><p>Before the Holy Light chains could get within three feet of Benjamin, they were completely frozen into icicles, before getting shredded into pieces by the snowflakes.</p><br/><p>This time, the bishops finally looked startled.</p><br/><p>\"...It has not been recorded in the data, it seems. Could it have learnt new magic?\" The spoke, as they summoned huge pieces of Holy Light to block the attack of the violent blizzard.</p><br/><p>Benjamin gave a cold snort. Wrapped within the snow and wind, he flew up, and rushed straight at the bishops.</p><br/><p>\"It has been some time since we've met. You seem to have grown stronger, huh?\" He said jokingly. \"Too bad that I won't stand still for you to study me.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

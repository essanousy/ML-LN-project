The only choice is to rely on you.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Kubei began paying more attention.</p><br/><p>He also wanted to know what methods are left to escape from the Lithur family troops.</p><br/><p>\"The Lithur family do not understand what our objectives are, and do not know how many people we have.\" Michelle said persuasively. \"Therefore, it should be easy for you to divert their attention. They will probably think the hostage is in your hands. All you have to do is run south, and they won\u2019t be able to catch up.\"</p><br/><p>Annie was hesitant:</p><br/><p>\"Me\u2026...divert their attention?\"</p><br/><p>Michelle nodded her head, then pointed at Kubei, saying:</p><br/><p>\"I will make him hide here with me. Once you lead the troops away, I\u2019ll bring him to open the treasure chest. Once I get what we want, we\u2019ll meet up at the same old place.\"</p><br/><p>She said this with confidence: \"Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll wait there for you!\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>After hearing Michelle, Annie was silent.</p><br/><p>Annie and even Kubei, who was beside them, could see that Michelle\u2019s plan was to sacrifice Annie and protect herself.</p><br/><p>It could be said that this strategy is to divert the enemy from the main target. In less optimistic terms, it was asking Annie to sacrifice herself. To grab the attention of the pursuing troops, she will have to get close to them. But once she gains proximity, it\u2019s hard to say whether or not she can escape them again.</p><br/><p>\"This plan is cruel,\" the System\u2019s robotic voice suddenly piped up. \"Torturing and escorting \u2013 all the tedious tasks are given to the younger sister. With this plan, you\u2019ll exhaust her energy and then send her out to be a bait. Even if Annie can use magic, it would be hard for her to get rid of the troops chasing her again.\"</p><br/><p>Kubei suddenly felt a chill run through his spine:</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re saying, she already planned to get rid of Annie all along?\"</p><br/><p>The System sounded really sure: \"It\u2019s obvious that she doesn\u2019t want to split the treasure with another person. Think about it: When Annie killed Sally, she knew clearly what she was doing. Why else would she pretend to be oblivious if not for this plan?\"</p><br/><p>Kubei sunk into deep thought.</p><br/><p>Before that, he only saw through one of Michelle\u2019s plot, but he didn\u2019t think too much of her then. With the latest insight, it seemed that the victory then may have been motivated by other factors:</p><br/><p>He needed to buy time to allow himself to escape. But Michelle, she needed to make a deal. As there were soldiers chasing her, she couldn\u2019t sit around questioning him. What seemed to be a victory for Kubei was probably deliberately given to him by Michelle.</p><br/><p>After thinking about it, Kubei felt as if he had fallen for her tricks.</p><br/><p>He shouldn\u2019t have spoken in the first place.</p><br/><p>If he kept his mouth shut, he would probably have to endure a lot of physical pain, but Michelle wouldn\u2019t kill him because she really wanted the treasure.</p><br/><p>To avoid the Lithur family troops, Michelle would keep changing the base of operations, and continue questioning him. During this tug-of-war between her and the troops, he can buy more time, and she\u2019ll lose her cool even further. In the end, he could probably put her into a state of panic.</p><br/><p>The one who should be panicking is Michelle, and not I, Kubei thought.</p><br/><p>Regarding the physical torture he\u2019d have to go through, Kubei felt that he has already endured quite a lot along the way.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m at a total loss here!\" He couldn\u2019t bear but say that to himself.</p><br/><p>\"But it\u2019s not really a total loss. Didn\u2019t Annie accidentally killed someone? If you can\u2019t put up with her torture, she\u2019ll probably kill you by accident as well, and that would be a shame.\" The System spoke in a friendly manner to comfort Kubei. \"Whichever the situation, you\u2019ll experience a little less torture.\u2019</p><br/><p>Kubei sighed again, but accepted his fate. He has already fallen for someone else\u2019s tricks, and that\u2019s the past. Rather than regretting it now, he should think of what to do next.</p><br/><p>He should know, he doesn\u2019t have much time left.</p><br/><p>\"Annie wouldn\u2019t be willing to become cannon fodder. What if I escape when they argue -- what are the chances of that?\"</p><br/><p>Kubei and the System discussed for a while, but it seemed like he was talking to himself.</p><br/><p>\"Very low.\" The System\u2019s reply was harsh as usual. \"Even if they started arguing, they wouldn\u2019t be totally blind. If a huge living person were to slip away under their eyes, who wouldn\u2019t notice?\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Kubei couldn\u2019t retort because it was a fact.</p><br/><p>He nodded, saying:</p><br/><p>\"What you say is right, do you have a better idea then?\"</p><br/><p>\"...No.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then we\u2019ll do what I say.\" Kubei said this with absolution.</p><br/><p>The System had nothing to say.</p><br/><p>After making a plan, Kubei\u2019s attention returned to reality. He quietly observed Michelle and Annie, waiting for the right moment.</p><br/><p>But his plan is bound for failure.</p><br/><p>Annie didn\u2019t speak and looked as if she couldn\u2019t make up her mind. Michelle, seeing this, knew that they didn\u2019t have much time. She walked forward and held Annie\u2019s hands, launching her \"affectionate Sister\" mode once more.</p><br/><p>\"Annie, I have believed in you up till now. Can you believe in me this time?\"</p><br/><p>Just with this sentence, a few sounds of sobbing came from within Annie\u2019s hood.</p><br/><p>After that, Annie said:</p><br/><p>\"Yeah, I believe in you!\"</p><br/><p>Kubei started panicking once more.</p><br/><p>They\u2026...actually\u2026...didn\u2019t argue...</p><br/><p>\"Michelle, under the third tree at the old place, I\u2019ve kept all my treasured belongings under there, remember to go dig them up.\" Annie said as she sobbed, as if she was giving her testament and will. \"You have to continue living on, and accomplish our dreams, I\u2019ll be there by your side...\"</p><br/><p>Saying this, the two hugged, and started crying.</p><br/><p>Kubei was speechless.</p><br/><p>\"She\u2019s not dumb, after all, she knew that Michelle was sending her to be cannon fodder. She knows that she\u2019ll die for sure. Why doesn\u2019t she fight back?</p><br/><p>Kubei couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing.</p><br/><p>The System behaved as it usually does, and in a tone similar to an old lady watching a Qiung Yao drama while wiping her tears, it said:</p><br/><p>Due to the lack of time, this display of \"Sisterly Affection\" was cut short. Annie only cried for a few seconds, and they parted. After the few seconds of gazing deeply into each other\u2019s eyes and holding hands, Annie nodded, and turned her back.</p><br/><p>The vision of her robes blurred as she ran towards the road where they came from.</p><br/><p>She was ready to divert the troops away.</p><br/><p>Seeing Annie\u2019s disappearing figure, Kubei still couldn\u2019t react.</p><br/><p>His plan was to run away when they argued, but his plans couldn\u2019t keep up with change. What he never expected was that they wouldn\u2019t even argue, and Annie would be so subservient to go to her death.</p><br/><p>How is her brain even wired?</p><br/><p>Looks like he has a lot more to learn about this new world that he has been teleported into.</p><br/><p>Right as Kubei was trying to figure out the next step, Michelle moved. She reached out her hand, and pointed it at Kubei, the night breeze blowing her long robes.</p><br/><p>A complicated and obscure incantation suddenly passed into Kubei\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Before Kubei could react, he felt a strong force surrounding him. This force bounded him in a flash, and he was unable to move a muscle.</p><br/><p>Michelle walked over, dragged him by his collar, and pulled him up the nearest tree.</p><br/><p>Kubei was stunned. What did she plan to do?</p><br/><p>Because of the magical bind, Kubei couldn\u2019t retaliate, and could only watch as he was dragged up the tree. Then, he was tied to the highest branch on the tree.</p><br/><p>After making sure Kubei was secure, Michelle sat beside him and used the tree leaves to create a perfect camouflage.</p><br/><p>She hid on top of the tree and waited for the Lithur troops to be diverted away.</p><br/><p>Kubei was bounded tightly in place and closely watched by Michelle. He was not even able to make any small movements.</p><br/><p>\"This woman has extraordinary strength!\"</p><br/><p>In the midst of the silence, the System suddenly exclaimed, startling Kubei: \"She\u2019s probably not male right? I was wrong, I shouldn\u2019t have asked you to seduce her.\"</p><br/><p>...</p><br/><p>The System wasn\u2019t at fault, Michelle did just display tremendous strength.</p><br/><p>Kubei\u2019s body was frail, but he was still a human, and should weigh at least forty-five kilograms. But Michelle just dragged him like she was holding a bag, and singlehandedly climbed up the tree. Such agility was spectacular to watch.</p><br/><p>Kubei could only continue to be in shock.</p><br/><p>\"In this new world, there are a lot of things I have to learn!\" he thought.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t panic, the magic should go away on its own. \" Michelle looked at Kubei, then said: \"Sir Lithur, I\u2019m only hoping that we can cooperate better, please don\u2019t bring me anymore trouble.</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>Kubei wanted to speak up, but found that the magic bound every part of him, even his mouth.</p><br/><p>He could only stare at her angrily.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re done for.\"</p><br/><p>The System voiced out again, taunting in its cold, robotic voice: \"Being bounded so tightly to this tree, there\u2019s no chance to escape at all. The troops would probably be diverted by Annie, and the hope that they will come to the rescue is no longer possible. You\u2019re absolutely done for this time.\"</p><br/><p>It was the truth.</p><br/><p>Kubei sighed. What Michelle did was cruel. Not only did she send Annie to become cannon fodder, but she managed to seal off all of his escape routes. Whether it was to escape or be rescued, both outcomes were out of Kubei\u2019s reach.</p><br/><p>\"Pity that I, such a magnificent piece of artificial intelligence who has so much potential, has to die here with you in this god forsaken place.\"</p><br/><p>The System started to ramble on how unlucky it was, giving Kubei goosebumps.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s enough, there\u2019s no point in saying all these. \"Kubei interrupted it, \"Who says that you and I are about to die here?\"</p><br/><p>The System stopped its rambling. Even though Kubei couldn\u2019t see it, he could feel it looking down on him: \"Poor child, you\u2019re about to die, having some hope is probably for the better.\"</p><br/><p>Kubei didn\u2019t take what it said to heart.</p><br/><p>\"Even a saint would make a mistake eventually. Michelle sealed off all of my escape routes, but, unknowingly, she may have opened a window for me.\"</p><br/><p>The System was the same as usual: \"Really? Where\u2019s the window, why can\u2019t I see it?</p><br/><p>Kubei didn\u2019t explain, but laughed in his heart. His attention came back to reality, and he looked at Michelle who was unaware of what was going on. He said in his mind to the System:</p><br/><p>\"Her incantation just now, you\u2019ve recorded it, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>The System was left speechless.</p><br/><p>\"The Waterball spell is probably useless, but a binding spell? She probably doesn\u2019t know that we still have a trump card. \"Saying this, Kubei looked at the sky with satisfaction. The night had descended, and the clouds covered the sky. It was a good time to hunt.</p><br/><p>Who would be the prey, and who would be the hunter?</p><br/><p>It is probably time got the roles to be swapped.</p><br/><p>Together with the night breeze, the sentence that broke the System\u2019s heart was uttered:</p><br/><p>\"Binding spell incantation, leave it on loop.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

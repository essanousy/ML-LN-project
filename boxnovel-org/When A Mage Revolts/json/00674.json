When he was calm, Benjamin did not dare to dig in too deep, otherwise, it would have been an awkward scene if a hole had appeared in the great hall.</p><br/><p>However, the things he had heard so far were almost enough.</p><br/><p>The other person must have felt that something was not right, and that was why the information he had told Benjamin just now was only a half-truth. The chosen location for the school, the arrangements for the propaganda\u2026 However, they were still treating Benjamin as only someone Mage Vinci had sent over to investigate them, and did not have any intention to pull out from their plans because of it.</p><br/><p>They still wanted to continue with it, only that they would do it with more decisiveness.</p><br/><p>They were really not scared of death\u2026</p><br/><p>Benjamin could not help but shake his head.</p><br/><p>Even if Mage Vinci had sent someone over to investigate, from the perspective of these people, it was only a matter of time before the people at the Academy of Magic would come to know of this. They were very clear that the Academy of Magic would definitely have their revenge on them. Because of that, they were willing to see this through until the end instead and speed up their entire plan.</p><br/><p>They were immediately sending out mages to the various destinations, using the runic law of meditation to fire up their own reputation, putting this entire matter into everyone\u2019s perspectives. Once the mages of all the countries began paying attention to the movements here, it would not be easy for Benjamin to strike under everyone\u2019s eyes, then.</p><br/><p>Too bad\u2026 In reality, Benjamin did not intend to personally make a move on them.</p><br/><p>After listening for a while, he turned around and left, returning to the isolated small path through the underground tunnel. He filled in the hole and left Randt City quickly.</p><br/><p>Since these people wanted to speed up, he would also speed up as well.</p><br/><p>Benjamin took out the transmission wood piece and began to issue instructions while flying. The information strongholds that the spies of the academy had already set up in various places began to shift. At the same time, the admissions work that had halted for a long time was also starting up again, sooner than scheduled because of this matter.</p><br/><p>\"If you do this\u2026 Isn\u2019t it a bit shameless?\"</p><br/><p>After watching from the sidelines for a long time, the System suddenly spoke.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t blame me, this is what they deserve,\" Benjamin gave a cold snort, saying, \"To be honest, I think that I am already very merciful, doing this to them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright then\u2026\"</p><br/><p>And so, heading in the direction of the City of Snow, Benjamin disappeared in the skies.</p><br/><p>Three days later.</p><br/><p>Randt City, in the headquarters of \"Shadow\", Mage Hansen was pacing about in the great hall anxiously, occasionally raising his head and looking out the empty doorway, his eyes filled with anxiety.</p><br/><p>\"Still not here yet\u2026\"</p><br/><p>He could not help but mutter to himself.</p><br/><p>Today was the day that he and Mage Randall had set for correspondence.</p><br/><p>Although all arrangements had been made, for some unknown reason, his emotions were simply somewhat uneasy. Mage Randall, who had been hiding in the academy, had no longer been contacting him for a long while now.</p><br/><p>He had thought about the possibility of Mage Randall being exposed; after all, a few days ago, someone from the academy had come over to check on them. But\u2026 Their success or failure depended on this next step; he really needed to know how the situation at the academy was like now, or else he would feel very unnerved.</p><br/><p>\"Mage Hansen, is there still no news from the academy?\" A mage suddenly walked in, asking nervously.</p><br/><p>Hansen shook his head.</p><br/><p>\"If that\u2019s the case\u2026 How about we just give up,\" The mage hesitated for a moment, before giving his advice, \"Have you heard of their Director Benjamin? He went against a hundred enemies, and defeated the leaders of the mages organizations from various places! If we offended him, this will not end well for us.\"</p><br/><p>Hansen gave a cold harumph, saying, \"We have already offended him\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the mage could only quiet down.</p><br/><p>Yes\u2026 They did not have any way out of this now.</p><br/><p>\"What are we worried about? Mages all around the country everywhere are already curious about how this voiceless magic casting works. As for the runes and the news of us building a school, we have also released them out little by little,\" Seeing that, Hansen could only speak some words of reassurance, \"As long as we officially publicize the news to everyone tonight, at the mages gathering, the runic law of meditation will forever belong to us!\"</p><br/><p>He was very clear that this sort of things was on a first come, first served basis. The people at the Academy of Magic had obtained false information and probably thought that they would only officially announce it after a month. How would they expect them to have acted so quickly?</p><br/><p>Once everything had been publicized, if that Director Benjamin dared lay his hands on them, his entire person would stink.</p><br/><p>The Academy of Magic would stink along with him!</p><br/><p>Thinking about this, Mage Hansen\u2019s heart was somewhat agitated.</p><br/><p>And so, he waited in the great hall. Many courier pigeons flew in today, but none that came from Mage Randall. But it was still alright because almost every letter contained a description of how successful their plan was. The runic law of meditation was being spread widely, and the mages were very looking forward to his new school.</p><br/><p>Very soon, it was nighttime. Mage Hansen, bringing tens of people with him, prepared to join the annual mages gathering in Randt City.</p><br/><p>Flying in the skies, they speedily rushed toward the villa for the gathering, in the suburbs. Along the way, they could even see mages who were also heading there. Hansen smiled and greeted them, and, when he thought about the surprised expressions that were probably going to be on their faces later, he could not help but feel excited.</p><br/><p>His next move\u2026 Would carve out a name for himself in magic history!</p><br/><p>However, it was at this time that he encountered another mage who was possibly going to the mages gathering as well.</p><br/><p>\"M-Mage Grant? How are you here?</p><br/><p>At this moment, the fellow that Mage Vinci had sent over to probe them was flying not far from them. And, after the fellow had sent them a greeting, he had even come close to them quickly, as though he was about to have a good chat with them.</p><br/><p>For some unknown reason, the smiling face suddenly caused Hansen to shiver.</p><br/><p>Was this fellow also going to attend the gathering?</p><br/><p>His unease, uncontainable due to agitation, was suddenly completely revealed. Hansen wanted to put on a hearty grin, as before, but all he could do was force a smile.</p><br/><p>The situation\u2026 Probably would not change, right?</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, what happened next was completely out of his expectations.</p><br/><p>\"No, you\u2019re mistaken. I\u2019m not Grant.\"</p><br/><p>The person flew near and suddenly stretched his hand out, using a water ball to wipe off the disguise on his face. With the flow of water and the humid, warm wind, a young face appeared.</p><br/><p>Hansen was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>What\u2026 What was happening?</p><br/><p>A disguise? Was he not the guy Mage Vinci had sent to check him out? Why had he come in a disguise? And\u2026 Now that he had taken his disguise off, what was he planning to do? What did he mean?</p><br/><p>Most importantly, looking at the other person\u2019s face, hair, eyes\u2026 He did not know why, but these physical characteristics suddenly gave Hansen a mild, familiar feeling.</p><br/><p>He seemed to\u2026 He seemed to have heard of a person who looked like this.</p><br/><p>In an instant, a frightening thought suddenly encroached him. But that thought was really too frightening, so frightening that he could not but push it back down, reassuring himself that this thought did not exist.</p><br/><p>And the other person continued to speak, after taking off his disguise.</p><br/><p>\"This is our second meeting. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Benjamin, a member of the Ruling Council of Icor, the savior mage of Ferelden, the owner of Academy, the founder and current Director of the Academy of Magic, and also, one of the first discoverers of the runic law of meditation.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

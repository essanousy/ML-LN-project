As he looked at the people falling one after another, he immediately reached out to draw a rune and activated the elemental order - heal as fast as he could.</p><br/><p>Following the cluster of the water element, drops of rain started falling in both the cells. Benjamin clenched his fists tightly and watched anxiously as the water droplets that were summoned started dropping onto the bodies of the servants, before slowly getting absorbed.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the System was shouting in his mind.</p><br/><p>\"Are you out of your mind? Runes cause a great level of elemental change. You\u2019re in Havenwright now, do you think the Church will not notice at all? People will rush here for sure!\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin remained calm, \"Then let them come.\"</p><br/><p>The healing water droplets continued for more than ten seconds. Eventually, the bodies of the people who were on the grounded started to shiver. Benjamin quickly panned over and saw that out of the forty people, he had managed to save six of them. As for the rest... Even if he continued using the rune, they would never wake up.</p><br/><p>Instantly, Benjamin summoned a large amount of vapor as fast as he could to pick up the six of them before quickly squeezing their way through the hole that he had entered through.</p><br/><p>\"What happened... Wait up! Who are these people? Stand where you are!\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, the warden\u2019s voice could be heard calling from outside of the cell. The few soldiers must had noticed something wrong and entered the basement to check the situation and saw Benjamin leaving with the prisoners.</p><br/><p>Their cries were ignored, Benjamin did not care about them at all.</p><br/><p>He summoned six water bubbles and wrapped the six servants who were lucky enough to survive. They disappeared up the passage that Benjamin had created with the help of a strong wind; the guards were swiftly left in the dust.</p><br/><p>After flying in the passage for a while, Benjamin used magic to blow up a small part of it in order to block the path. Thus, even if the wardens manage to react, they would not be able to follow them.</p><br/><p>\".... Creating such a chaos in Havenwright, you must be trying to die.\" On the way out, the System sighed and said.</p><br/><p>Benjamin shrugged, \"Not like it\u2019s the first time anyway.\"</p><br/><p>He escaped with the people in just half a minute. When they finally resurfaced, Benjamin sped up again and took the six lucky survivors with him as he flew towards the sky, speeding away from Havenwright.</p><br/><p>He knew the circumstances, he could not hesitate with his actions.</p><br/><p>The wardens were not the only ones who noticed the jailbreak, the priests in the city, the cleaners... With such a big movement from the runes magic, they must have noticed it from the start and were just now starting to mobilize.</p><br/><p>Had he dragged it for another few minutes, the whole the Church would have been alerted; if that were to happen he might now have been able to leave. The Church would find an excuse to seal the city gates, thus restricting anyone from leaving. Moreover, Benjamin was not like Michelle, he could not spread a \"plague\" in Havenwright, so he could only try to leave via brute force.</p><br/><p>Thus, he could only utilize that few precious minutes to dash out of the city as quickly as he could.</p><br/><p>\"Quick, look! What\u2019s that?\"</p><br/><p>Clearly, Benjamin\u2019s actions had alerted many people in the city. Along the streets, people were looking up to the sky one after another, pointing at the swiftly moving shadow and the six bubbles in the sky.</p><br/><p>Even the priests were not allowed to fly in the sky of the city. For the people who lived in the Kingdom of Helius, such a sight was rare.</p><br/><p>Benjamin flew towards the North City Gate which was closest to him, and in a few minutes, arrived at the borders. The defending soldiers near the gates noticed his shadow immediately. At that moment, the nervous soldiers squeezed towards the gate, those who spotted him first kept on crying out things like \"call for the priest immediately\".</p><br/><p>There were some priests among the guards at the gates of Havenwright as well. They stood along the walls of the city, looking from afar as Benjamin flew closer. Enraged, they shouted.</p><br/><p>\"Where are you from, mage? How dare you fly in the skies of the Imperial City...\"</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>Their indignant cries were cut short.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Benjamin was not anywhere near them yet, but an ice blade as light as snow sped past their eyes. The priests saw the flash, then the shields on them got triggered and then destroyed; the foot soldiers near them watched in horror as their heads dropped onto the floor and blood started pouring from their decapitated necks.</p><br/><p>Following this, a number of headless corpses started falling down from the walls like dominoes.</p><br/><p>The soldiers were all scared to death.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, my... Oh my god...\"</p><br/><p>By now, Benjamin was only ten over meters from the city walls. He stared straight ahead emotionlessly, sped up again, and dashed out with the six water bubbles!</p><br/><p>The Church had responded quite slowly. Even if he turned around and looked, he would probably see that there was probably no sign of any soldiers chasing after them. As for the wall in front of him...that defense might as well have not been there.</p><br/><p>If they left the city, hid in a remote mountain, then escape through the mountain range at the country\u2019s border, the Church would never be able to chase after them.</p><br/><p>However, just before he flew past the city walls.</p><br/><p>\"Careful!\"</p><br/><p>The System shouted suddenly. Benjamin was shocked and made an emergency break mid-air.</p><br/><p>He saw that a huge golden barrier had suddenly appeared in front of him; it was like a gigantic wall, blocking his path completely. As Benjamin looked closer, he saw that the barrier seemed to be stretching out from the city walls. The golden barrier was as bright as the sun and formed a cube-like shape over the entire city.</p><br/><p>The whole of Havenwright was enclosed within it; the golden barrier was stretched out across few thousand square kilometers, with seemingly no end to it.</p><br/><p>Benjamin could not help but hold his breath.</p><br/><p>To think, the Church had such a trick...</p><br/><p>But he could not hesitate, he had to make a decision in an extremely short time. There was already some movement from the streets down below, if he allowed the Church\u2019s army to arrive, then he would be in big trouble.</p><br/><p>Thus, he said a short, quiet syllable.</p><br/><p>\"Water.\"</p><br/><p>The water elements from the sky started gushing in like a tsunami.</p><br/><p>At the same time, on the streets about few thousand kilometers away, Grant who was surrounded by countless priests and Holy Knights suddenly looked up and frowned.</p><br/><p>\"... The Power of Origin.\" He subconsciously mumbled.</p><br/><p>Moments later, everyone else was gawking at the site as well. More than half of the people in the Imperial Capital had rushed to the streets and were now looking towards the sky with their eyes wide-open. They were in shock at the mind-blowing sight.</p><br/><p>\"Is it... Is it the water ball devil? He\u2026 he\u2019s here?\"</p><br/><p>After a few seconds, someone shouted out in shock.</p><br/><p>The people turned their heads and saw a blue fist almost as large as half of the city suddenly appear in the sky to the north of Havenwright.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

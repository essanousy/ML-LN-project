They had their entire body bowed towards him, and started worshipping him like a god.</p><br/><p>\"Oh great mage, we are willing to serve you as our Lord!\"</p><br/><p>Seeing the situation happening before him, Benjamin only hummed in acknowledgement.</p><br/><p>\"You both infiltrated the palace with intent to ambush the King, but instead you both got caught by me. Therefore, it goes without saying that your lives belong to me.\" Benjamin continued while shaking his head, \"Why do I feel\u2026that your gratitude does not have even a speck of sincerity?\"</p><br/><p>The siblings raised their heads from the ground, openly stunned at Benjamin\u2019s words and rendered silent.</p><br/><p>The System however spoke up, its tone disdainful, \"They\u2019re both kids, only slightly older than ten, what is the point of making things so difficult for them?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026Please, I\u2019m not that much older than them too.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are you talking about your physical age? Or your mental age?\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin didn\u2019t want to talk the System anymore.</p><br/><p>Two people who have been impressed by his \"overpowering aura\" have finally appeared, why can\u2019t he act all high and mighty in front of his lackeys? Why won\u2019t the System let him have this?</p><br/><p>Shaking his head in defeat, Benjamin\u2019s gaze once again fell onto the two in front of him, who clearly did not know what to do with themselves. After the System\u2019s jab at him, Benjamin has lost interest in picking trouble with them. He cajoled them by saying, \"Forget it, I wasn\u2019t expecting for the both of you to do anything anyways. Get up, I won\u2019t treat you both like criminals and send you to the gallows.\"</p><br/><p>The both of them wore expressions of confusion and stood up hesitantly. The girl hesitated for a moment before asking, \"Great mage, are you\u2026really willing to take us in?\"</p><br/><p>\"I wouldn\u2019t call it taking you both in yet, you both have to work for me.\" Benjamin continued with a shrug of his shoulders, \"People like you, who practice psychic powers, are few and far in between in this country. Besides, if there comes a day where we have to venture out into sea to face the cult from the island, we would not let you both die in vain.\"</p><br/><p>In an instant, the both of them shared a glance, shock lacing their features.</p><br/><p>We\u2026have to go back there?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded his head, \"Why? Don\u2019t you want to exact your revenge on that elder? The drug that almost killed you both was given to you by him right?\"</p><br/><p>The girl seemed reluctant at the idea and said, \"Sir, the elder\u2026is really strong. He keeps around twenty strong magical creatures, and he is also supported by twelve priests. He is not easy to handle.\"</p><br/><p>After hearing the girl\u2019s warnings, Benjamin felt something stir in his head.</p><br/><p>\u2026Keeping magical creatures?</p><br/><p>This was something that the mages of the internal department were secretly testing out, like the Mage Guild of Icor, who were already researching such things even before the Queen stepped down from her rule, but they were never successful. Benjamin has also seen books related to this, but all of them were on semi-finished products with severe side effects, so it wasn\u2019t possible to use them. Therefore, the keeping of magical creatures has never been part of the army regime.</p><br/><p>However, the foreign cult, with wielders of psychic power, has managed to achieve this.</p><br/><p>That was when Benjamin realized that he was face-to-face with something essential to possibly tilting the situation in the army\u2019s favor. If they managed to get a hold of this skill, they would be able to fight even the Church\u2019s Cannon of Holy Light.</p><br/><p>\"Do you both wield the skill of keeping magical creatures?\" asked Benjamin immediately after realizing so.</p><br/><p>The siblings shook their heads in reply.</p><br/><p>\"We can control weaker magical creatures for a short amount of time. But taming them over a long term\u2026only a few of the elders wield that skill.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded his head solemnly.</p><br/><p>Seems Benjamin has no choice but to pay that foreign archipelago a visit.</p><br/><p>\"Great mage, you\u2026\" The both of them somehow understood that Benjamin was going overseas from his expression, and fear laced their own.</p><br/><p>\"Do not worry.\" Benjamin regained himself and interrupted them, waving his hand as he said, \"Is that elder as powerful as me?\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>The brother and sister were stunned. Maybe they really were overpowered by Benjamin\u2019s aura, as they only recovered themselves after a brief moment. They looked at each other, unsure on how to respond.</p><br/><p>Seeing their reactions, Benjamin chuckled dryly, \"There is no need to be so nervous. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m leaving immediately. Return to your rooms for now and work on your Spiritual Energy, then follow me back to the Academy tomorrow. One day, you\u2019ll make that elder pay.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing Benjamin\u2019s words, they nodded their heads vigorously, excitement showing on their faces.</p><br/><p>As he watched them leave, Benjamin suddenly thought of something and immediately asked, \"By the way, didn\u2019t I lock the door? How did you both manage to leave? And how did you know where my room was?\"</p><br/><p>The boy turned his head and answered with an embarrassed tone, \"We\u2026bewitched a passing guard to open the door for us, before leading us here.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s hand immediately went to his temples as he scolded, \"Don\u2019t do that again. Unless I allow you too, do not simply cast your psychic powers onto others.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026Understood.\"</p><br/><p>With that, the both of them turned to leave. Benjamin couldn\u2019t help but shake his head.</p><br/><p>These two brats were not easy to control.</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, the fact that the both of them recovered themselves so quickly after almost breaking down was a feat in and of itself. They did not hurt themselves, nor did they escape in the cover of the night. After being abandoned by their home in an unfamiliar place, they finally decided to depend on Benjamin.</p><br/><p>Doing so was probably the smartest choice.</p><br/><p>If they dared to run away, Benjamin would spare no effort in catching them. And he wouldn\u2019t let their days after be easy too.</p><br/><p>And so, with all problems solved, Benjamin slept soundly that night. The following morning, after bidding the King farewell, Benjamin left Gealorre with the brother and sister in tow. While explaining about mages and about the place they were in, Benjamin flew them all back and successfully arrived at the Academy of Magic in two days.</p><br/><p>\"You both should settle down in Academy and practice on your psychic powers. Try to summarize all you have learned into a book, too. If anything happens, come look for me at the Academy.\"</p><br/><p>Immediately after relaying his words, Benjamin rushed to the Academy\u2019s Magic Tools Department.</p><br/><p>In the elemental plane, he had spent a lot of effort in memorizing all the secret blueprints. He\u2019s worried that the longer he took, the harder it is for him to remember.</p><br/><p>\"Director, you\u2019re finally back?\"</p><br/><p>Even before Benjamin could open his mouth after entering the laboratory, Morris immediately came over on his wheelchair, expression slightly distraught, as if he were waiting for Benjamin for too long.</p><br/><p>\"Yes. I\u2019ve obtained some important blueprints on my trip, so I\u2019ve brought them over for research,\" relayed Benjamin with a shrug of his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Morris only shook his head in response.</p><br/><p>\"Now is not the time for blueprints. We\u2019ve made a new breakthrough while researching the combination of runes and magic tools.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

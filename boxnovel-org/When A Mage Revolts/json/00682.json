However, he didn\u2019t retreat despite the show of power.</p><br/><p>\"Sir Benjamin, I think that there is no need for you to possess such hostility towards us. If I remember correctly, none of the mages subscribe to a religion. Your existence and ours do not go against each other. Only an organization like the Church of Holy Light would be our enemies.\"</p><br/><p>\"So what?\" spat Benjamin coldly, \"As if trespassing into Carretas and messing up Gealorre wasn\u2019t enough, you had the nerve to spike my alcohol. Did you think I would be so oblivious?\"</p><br/><p>Even if there was no direct conflict of interest, unknown religions and mages have always clashed. Be it a church, or the An-something-Hu Religion previously, mages who wielded supernatural abilities like gods were always a big obstacle in the process of the spreading of religion.</p><br/><p>With the power to do things that only gods could do at the flick of a wrist, why would the people still need religion?</p><br/><p>Entrusting your heart and soul to a shapeless idol isn\u2019t everybody\u2019s cup of tea.</p><br/><p>When a religion is still small, it would of course seem friendly and harmless. But when an organization starts growing stronger slowly, the desire to spread its teachings without a care of consequences grows more intense as well.</p><br/><p>\"We just wanted to attract your attention.\" Shaking his head, Spencer continued, \"Besides, I have done them no harm yet. Joy, anger, love, and hate are the truest emotions that exist in each human being. I\u2019ve only let them discard those fake doctrines to return to their core.\"</p><br/><p>\"What a way of putting it\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin let out a disdainful laugh. At the wave of his hand, an Ice Blade appeared in mid-air before landing in front of him. The landing of the Ice Blade was followed by a sensation of something being chopped in half before a strong wave of magic fluctuation flowed out.</p><br/><p>A shrill shriek echoed shortly after.</p><br/><p>Instantly, all the blood drained from Spencer\u2019s face, his smile nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026You can see it.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded his head and said, \"Yes, I can see it. So stop using those disgusting things of yours to plant a trap against me.\"</p><br/><p>Although Benjamin said so, he could not see it at all.</p><br/><p>While they were in the middle of their conversation, the System suddenly warned him of something emerging from Spencer\u2019s body, which was slowly crawling towards him. Following the instructions given by the System, Benjamin had chopped the suspicious thing in half.</p><br/><p>\"Feels like\u2026Spiritual Energy, but it seems to be mixed with something else,\" said the System after its analysis of the thing\u2019s components.</p><br/><p>It was obvious to Benjamin that this worshipper from across the seas possessed a weird ability. It was different from divine magic, and all Benjamin could do was heed the System\u2019s advice as he could not figure out what it was.</p><br/><p>\"How interesting.\" Spencer\u2019s eyes lit up with curiosity once more,\" Sir Benjamin, you are very different from the mages and priests we\u2019ve seen before. Their Spiritual Energies were stronger than most, but they were also weaker than most. You however\u2026you have a strong and stable Spiritual Energy, as if there is a whole world inside you.\"</p><br/><p>Shock tugged at Benjamin\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Was he talking about the Space of Consciousness?</p><br/><p>Of course, this did not necessarily mean that Spencer had seen through Benjamin\u2019s Spiritual Energy. After the thing that tried to sneakily attack him had been disposed of, the System stated that Spencer\u2019s aura had weakened considerably. He was probably just diverting their attention, or just pulling a bluff.</p><br/><p>\"I have no interest in your nonsense. Either you release the spell on these people, or I turn you into minced meat,\" said Benjamin with a shake of his head.</p><br/><p>Spencer\u2019s eyebrows furrowed in response, \"Are all mainland mages this rude?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, just me. Blame it on your bad luck for letting you meet the rudest one of all mainland mages.\"</p><br/><p>Much to Benjamin\u2019s surprise, Spencer agreed to his request with a nod of his head.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026Alright.\"</p><br/><p>He looked at the crowd that were enjoying themselves surrounding them. Suddenly, he closed his eyes, and a powerful wave of Spiritual Energy emitted from his body. Benjamin was slightly stunned; he has never felt Spiritual Energy this strong before. This was the strongest he has seen yet, and it even surpassed what he thought was the limit for humans.</p><br/><p>Even the Pope would not have this level of Spiritual Energy.</p><br/><p>Upon further inspection, Benjamin realized that the Spiritual Energy was also condensed beyond expectations. Unlike the misty and shapeless state that the energy of other mages had, Spencer\u2019s energy was condensed enough to have a form like vines, which extended to its surroundings to hang on the shoulders of all the people in the hall.</p><br/><p>One by one, everybody around them, including the King, dropped to the floor like flies.</p><br/><p>\"This is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin furrowed his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\"No need to worry, they\u2019ll be awake when tomorrow arrives.\" Spencer continued lazily, \"Sad, really. We spent a lot of effort to control all the officials of Carretas. Now it\u2019s all gone to waste.\"</p><br/><p>\"What are you trying to achieve?\"</p><br/><p>Spencer shook his head. \"Haven\u2019t I said this before? We are just looking for a place to rest.\"</p><br/><p>However, Benjamin still felt that the whole situation was just too fishy. After a moment of hesitation, he asked, \"If that is true, are you giving up so easily?\"</p><br/><p>\"Well, what am I to do? I am no match for you anyways.\" After everyone had fallen, Spencer opened his eyes and said, \"Your Spiritual Energy is also at the critical point, I\u2019m sure you can easily get rid of the fragments I\u2019ve left in them.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin only hummed in response.</p><br/><p>Even if this worshipper from across the seas had been harmless until now, Benjamin knows that this guy was smiling when he attempted to attack Benjamin sneakily. Matters were not as simple as it seemed, apparently.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ve changed my mind, you\u2019re dying here today,\" said Benjamin after mulling his thoughts over, eyes glazed over with murderous intent. A barrage of ice thorns flew towards Spencer, locking him into place as he drowned in them.</p><br/><p>However, Spencer only smiled.</p><br/><p>\"Why is Sir Benjamin always so rushed?\"</p><br/><p>Without moving from his position, Spencer\u2019s body started fading. As if he were a scroll that was soaked in water, his entire body started blurring together. As the ice thorns flew into each other, Spencer disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>Benjamin gripped his fist tightly. \"What happened?\" He asked in his head as he looked around nervously.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026 I have no idea, he just disappeared,\" said the System in disbelief. \"There was no fluctuation even right before he vanished.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin furrowed his eyebrows once again, creases forming in between them.</p><br/><p>\"Come out, I can see you,\" said Benjamin suddenly, expression shifting into something akin to disdain.</p><br/><p>Upon the utterance of those words, a silhouette appeared from somewhere to his left.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

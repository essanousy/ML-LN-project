A huge spiritual pressure came upon their heads, causing them to feel out of breath.</p><br/><p>\"No no no! We\u2026 We did not strike, you cannot strike us as well!\" Hansen was so shocked, he hurriedly spoke, shouting those words.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, he really wanted to slap himself in the face twice.</p><br/><p>Half of the rumors that had spread so far about the director of the Academy of Magic were about how terrifying his powers were. Although Hansen acknowledged himself as a formidable character, he was very clear that it was impossible for him alone to fight against the leader of a few hundred mages.</p><br/><p>If this guy had a good, official reason to hurt them, they would already be dead today.</p><br/><p>The members of the Mage Guild also hurried to stop Benjamin, advising him, \"Don\u2019t\u2026 If you strike here, it will be difficult for us to explain this to the higher-ups. The reputation of the Mage Guild and Her Highness the Queen would all be tarnished.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shrugged and waved his hand, dissolving the ice pieces that had just been gathered up, looking extremely resentful.</p><br/><p>That resentful expression, in Hansen\u2019s eyes, made him feel scared.</p><br/><p>They were\u2026 Stroking the beard of a strange monster!</p><br/><p>At this moment, Hansen\u2019s heart was filled with regret. Why had he felt so lucky before this, and thought that they could steal the runic law of meditation without anyone realizing?</p><br/><p>And now, their actions had forced them to a dead end.</p><br/><p>They could not fight, they could not speak. Time was wasted, bit by bit, in such a deadlock. If they could not make it to the gathering today, and be the first to publicize the runic law of meditation to everyone, he was afraid that they would not have the chance anymore in the future\u2026</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a thought seemed to strike Hansen, and his face changed.</p><br/><p>\"You have sent others to attend the gathering!\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Benjamin raised his eyebrows, saying, \"I have not sent anyone there. Mage Vinci had long received an invitation and wanted to come to Randt City for the gathering. This has nothing to do with me.\"</p><br/><p>Stunned, Hansen began to shout agitatedly again, \"You\u2026 You guys, let me go! It\u2019s all the devious trick of this fellow! I\u2026 I must get there today, or else... Or else\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The attitudes of the Mage Guild members were as resolute as they were at the start.</p><br/><p>\"My apologies, you have to come with us. If you are really innocent, we will let you go very soon. But if you continue to refuse to cooperate with us like now, this will be a huge discredit against you at the palace trial.\"</p><br/><p>\"I don\u2019t care! You let me go!\"</p><br/><p>\"No\u2026\"</p><br/><p>No matter what, they could not come up with anything reasonable; a lot of time had passed, and Hansen\u2019s throat was hoarse from all the shouting. In the end, he stopped, tired, with a disappointed expression on his face.</p><br/><p>He had finally, fully understood.</p><br/><p>Appearing here alone, Benjamin had not planned to fight here; it was only to delay them. St that annual mage gathering, possibly now while they were arguing with the Mage Guild, Mage Vinci had already announced the runic law of meditation on their behalf.</p><br/><p>Seeing the vague smile on Benjamin, Hansen suddenly felt a chill up his spine.</p><br/><p>This young rascal\u2026 He wanted to mess Hansen to his death!</p><br/><p>\"No, you will not succeed,\" For a moment, Hansen clenched his fists, speaking in a low voice, \"Even if Mage Vinci announces it for you, so what? It is not like everyone will believe you! We\u2026 We have people in every country who have learned the runic law of meditation, we have arranged this for a long time. They will tell everyone who is the owner of the law!\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Benjamin shook his head, and let out a scornful laugh.</p><br/><p>\"Are you talking about those mages? Pfft\u2026 I\u2019ve forgotten to tell you, the Academy of Magic has just opened up for enrolment this afternoon. Also, our main recruitment gimmick is the runic law of meditation. In Icor, Ferelden, Carretas\u2026 Even in the remote villages, we have put up posters publicizing it. Some introductory books to help promote us have also been printed out. I think these are done much better than your books.</p><br/><p>Hansen and his mages were stunned.</p><br/><p>How could it\u2026 Was it, was it true?</p><br/><p>Seeing that, Benjamin smiled and continued saying, \"You also know that our power of news dissemination has always been a bit stronger, the government is also willing to cooperate with us. Think about it. When those men of yours come to their senses, and tell others about how they are the true owners of the runic law of meditation, who would believe them?\"</p><br/><p>Hearing his description, Hansen was already shaking his head, beginning his refusal to believe this cruel reality.</p><br/><p>They had prepared for so long\u2026 The various promotional techniques\u2026 How could it end up like this? It was impossible, this fellow must be trying to intimidate them!</p><br/><p>But\u2026 What if what he said was true?</p><br/><p>Hansen, in his heart, was very conscious about the huge difference between the influence of \"Shadow\" and the Academy of Magic. He had exerted so much effort to get the mages performing the voiceless casting of magic, to fit other people\u2019s appetite so that there would be an explosive response at their big reveal, and everyone would remember them!</p><br/><p>However, if the Academy of Magic had snatched that first step away from them, by the time they came out, they would only be seen as shameless plagiarists and would be shunned by thousands of people. There would be no place for them in the community of mages.</p><br/><p>Thinking up until here, Hansen felt his entire body growing cold.</p><br/><p>A few hours earlier he had been so excited about the fame awaiting them. But now, he had descended into the deep abyss of hopelessness. There was only darkness before his eyes.</p><br/><p>He was already so desolate, but Benjamin\u2019s performance did not seem to have ended.</p><br/><p>Scratching the back of his head, Benjamin suddenly pulled out a piece of map from his pocket. He opened the map up to show Hansen, and spoke, with an innocent expression, \"Oh right, there\u2019s this too. Did you not buy the farm in Saar Village, so that you could build an academy there? I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some misunderstanding here. They seemed to have also sold the farm to me. I feel you had best go to them and inquire properly about this matter.\"</p><br/><p>\"You!\"</p><br/><p>In that instant, Hansen was so furious, he almost swore.</p><br/><p>If it was not that he had thought about the power Benjamin had just displayed, he might even have begun to fight. But, also because he was reminded of Benjamin\u2019s power, he did not even have the right to be emotional anymore. There was only endless grievance left in his heart.</p><br/><p>He would not be able to win a fight, and there were no more tricks up his sleeves, he\u2026 What else could he do?</p><br/><p>In hopelessness, Hansen was soon in such a state that he could not even be angry in the least bit.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026 After this ends, you will kill us all, right?\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Benjamin shook his head, laughing.</p><br/><p>\"Kill you all? Why would I? According to the law, you have to pay compensation for stealing other people\u2019s secrets. Let me calculate\u2026 At least two hundred thousand gold pieces. If I kill you, who is going to pay up?\"</p><br/><p>\"Two, two hundred thousand gold pieces?!\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, Hansen could not believe his ears.</p><br/><p>\"Right\u2026 I forgot to tell you,\" Benjamin, however, smiled again, and said happily, \"I still have to thank you for your previous rally. We have made use of it all. Our results for the academy enrolments this time are absolutely unprecedented!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

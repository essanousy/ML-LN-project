After leaving the hall, he finally went back to his own room.</p><br/><p>As he laid on his bed, he felt the day's tiredness suddenly just rushed through his body. But he persevered through his tiredness and entered the space of consciousness. He planned to look for the small bubble that appeared not too long ago.</p><br/><p>In the darkness in the space of consciousness, he could not control even an ounce of the water element. Benjamin was not used to this, but because all the water element was compressed into a small bubble, it wasn't all that bad.</p><br/><p>Three magic runes stood peacefully beneath the blue light at the corners, the bubble was still floating in the middle.</p><br/><p>As he went over to check on it, perhaps it was due to the fact that he had used too much magic today, the water element in the bubble did not replenish.</p><br/><p>While he was in the ruins, he did not have the chance to fully explore the changes in his space of consciousness. He had been in battle so many times but he had still yet to hear of the water element completely drying out. This showed that even after releasing the water element rain, there was still a lot left over.</p><br/><p>The sages that appeared after the rain would probably not appear again.</p><br/><p>However, Benjamin was still not satisfied with the rate the bubble was filling up.</p><br/><p>Even when he was fully relying on his body's own restorative powers, it was still too slow.</p><br/><p>And so, he took a deep breath to focus and shake off his weariness before focusing his efforts on pulling in the water elements from the outside world. With one foot in the real world and one foot in the space of consciousness, he managed to pull in the water elements that were floating about and save them into the water bubble.</p><br/><p>Before this, he would always meditate before going to bed, but now, with the existence of the water bubble, there was no need for him to do his meditation. He only had to continuously fill the water bubble and let out the water element rain, then through this process, his spells will become more powerful.</p><br/><p>From the looks of things, the process of collecting the water elements was fast taking over his previous habit, and becoming his new \"meditation ritual\".</p><br/><p>After meditating with his new way for a while, Benjamin left the space of consciousness and went to bed.</p><br/><p>The night passed uneventfully.</p><br/><p>After breakfast the next day, Benjamin left the house and went straight to the Mage Freemasonry at the city of Rayleigh to pay them a visit.</p><br/><p>The north part of the city of Rayleigh was a white building that resembled a library, Benjamin walked in and saw the servant standing in the hall. And he asked the servant, \"Have you seen the mage Tony?\"</p><br/><p>\"May I ask who are you?\" The servant hesitated before asking respectfully.</p><br/><p>\"My name is Benjamin, can you let him know that I am here?\"</p><br/><p>\"Benjamin? You are the mage Benjamin?\" Surprisingly, even the servant watching the door also heard of Benjamin. The servant had a look of surprise as she said, \"It is an honor to meet you, the mage Tony already gave us instructions, come with me.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was surprised but didn't say anything as he nodded his head. The servant led him to a elegantly decorated room.</p><br/><p>There was a dark maroon rug on the floor, and book racks filled to the brim with books covered the walls. Benjamin looked curiously at the tomes. Unfortunately, most of them had nothing to do with magic. It was made up of books on folklore, encyclopedias, books on history, there were so many of these.</p><br/><p>He sat down at the table, and the servant served him gently. Carefully giving him wine and snack, letting him live the life of a nobel for a while.</p><br/><p>These mages really are living the good life.</p><br/><p>\"Please wait a while, the mage Tony will be with you shortly.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin just nodded his head.</p><br/><p>The servant bowed and left the room.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was enjoying the food set before him and after a while Tony opened the door and joined him. He gave a smile and sat down opposite Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"Master Benjamin, I never thought that you would really come here to visit me.\"</p><br/><p>Maybe it was because of what happened in the ruins but he looked very awkward.</p><br/><p>Benjamin didn't mind. He took a sip of the wind and said, \"When you think about it, there is a world out there where magic has been defeated. That world is able to reach ours, it really makes me uncomfortable. So this morning, I came to visit you.\"</p><br/><p>To remove the cult, Benjamin cannot do it on his own. That was why he was here. He knew the Mages Freemasonry was not strong, but they had their own influence.</p><br/><p>As long as they realize the severity of the situation, Benjamin did not have to be too stressed up.</p><br/><p>Tony laughed and said, \"That really is a terrifying world.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shrugged and said, \"I'm not going to beat around the bush with you, I am very sure that the power in that world is also present in our world. Do you remember the days when we were bullied by the cult? The object that I used to go over to the other world was something that I stole from them.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment Tony became awkward as his face changed.</p><br/><p>\"Are you serious?\"</p><br/><p>\"I'm not lying.\" Benjamin continued and said, \"I'm sure after you came back you didn't do anymore research right? The noise that we heard in the ruins is the same as the language of the cult.\"</p><br/><p>\"Maybe it's just a coincidence. The cult is so small and weak, so different from what we experienced in the ruins.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head and said, \"Which cult is strong in the beginning? I don't know if you have heard this, but before the attacks, the cult had some relationship with the street gangs. They may be just the rats in the gutter, but it's enough proof of their intentions.\"</p><br/><p>Tony just took a deep breath and nodded his head, \"I heard some news from Ferelden's army, but because the cult was small and weak, no one is taking it seriously.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin immediately added fuel to fire and said, \"And now? After what happened yesterday, we as mages cannot take this lightly, who knows what they are planning in secret.\"</p><br/><p>In the end, the Mages Freemasonry and the Ferelden army do have a connection. He just had to convince this group of mages, then he would have nothing to do and then Ferelden will handle the clean up all on its own.</p><br/><p>After hesitating for a long time, Tony seemed convinced and said, \"I believe what master is saying, but this is not a small matter. I will report this and convince the people up there, but I cannot guarantee anything aside from these.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin had a solemn look on his face as he looked Tony in the eye and said, \"You should understand that this determines the mages' future.\"</p><br/><p>Tony took a deep breath and nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Benjamin also knew that he had achieved his purpose in coming here. Tony may not be a great mage, but he must have a say in things here. Benjamin wasn't lying to them, he just wanted Tony to grab their attention, so they can do a deeper investigation. They will definitely find something wrong with the cult.</p><br/><p>In the end, Benjamin did not have to nag them, they will help Benjamin settle things.</p><br/><p>\"Since you are able to understand the importance of this matter, then I really am relieved.\" Benjamin stood up from the chair and said, \"You must be very busy, I won't disturb you anymore.\"</p><br/><p>Tony could only nod his head. As Benjamin was turning to leave, doubt swept through his face, and he suddenly stood up and called to him.</p><br/><p>\"Master Benjamim, wait a minute.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin frowned and turned around? \"What is it?\"</p><br/><p>Tony sighed and said, \"Master Benjamin? You know the mage Vinci?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin's heart have a tug but he didn't show anything on his face as he said, \"Of course I do. I just joined the gathering he had at his place a few days ago.\"</p><br/><p>Was there something going on?</p><br/><p>Tony considered his mext sentence before saying, \"The mage Vinci, I don't know if anything happened between you two but it was as though he doesn't like you. Before, when he visited the Mages Freemasonry, he advised us to be careful of you.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

No expressions were shown.</p><br/><p>Grant only recognized that person through his voice and action.</p><br/><p>Ding ding ding ding! Continuous crashing sounds of metals were heard, as the mysterious man moved closer to Grant, he waved the silver dagger in his hand and launched a series of attack toward Grant mid-air.</p><br/><p>However, the Holy Light Armor worn by Grant was not just a cheapie, it managed to block all the attacks launched.</p><br/><p>\"Let's see how you can hide now!\"</p><br/><p>Grant took the opportunity and clustered an ultimate light. The man, on the other hand, had nowhere else to leverage as he jumped up to mid-air just to hold Grant back. Thus, after numerous failures of attack, Grant finally managed to retaliate!</p><br/><p>With that, the light whooshed and hit right at the man\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>A sneer was heard from beneath the iron mask instead.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Grant\u2019s face finally showed an exceedingly shocked expression. The light filaments which clustered countless holy light disappeared at the man\u2019s heart just like that, dissipating without a trace.</p><br/><p>\"You...\"</p><br/><p>A voice was heard from beneath the iron mask too, \"Your divine art is useless against me. Hence, you should stop playing tricks and stay here with me for a while.\"</p><br/><p>As he said that, he suddenly took out an odd iron hook and hooked it on the gap of the armor. While pulling the firm iron chain, the mysterious man managed to hang in the air longer and shorten the distance between himself and Grant. He then continued attacking the Holy Light Armor relentlessly.</p><br/><p>As for the dagger in his hand... it was shining with a different kind of light. It was obvious that it was not an ordinary iron.</p><br/><p>Under the continuous attacks, it would be possible for the Holy Light Armor to be broken. If that were to happen, Grant would fall into great danger because his divine art would suddenly start to disperse and scatter as soon as it went near to the man.</p><br/><p>\"I wasn\u2019t expecting this... Abyss trials?\"</p><br/><p>Grant\u2019s pupils shrunk.</p><br/><p>For hundreds of years, the Church had actually experimented it for countless times and proved with facts that it was an impossible task. He could not believe that he actually witnessed a life event of such a story with groundless statements that were recorded in the ancient books.</p><br/><p>He felt that it would be a tough matter.</p><br/><p>There was no other way, as he was flying in the air, he could only suffer the beatings. Therefore, in the end, he flew toward the group of knights underneath him. A huge number of knights were already gathered at that moment, they watched as the pope descended, and surrounded him immediately, they wanted to make the man come down as he captured the pope and kept hitting him.</p><br/><p>\"Everyone! Surround me and catch him with your hands, don\u2019t let him have any space for movements!\" Grant instructed loudly.</p><br/><p>He knew that although the abyss trials could endow someone with an immunity to any effects of the magical divine arts, that someone would nevertheless still be just a person ultimately. Even with the help of magic potions, under the circumstances where he had no space to use his powers, that person would still be defeated by the crowd.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, as soon as the knights surrounded them, the mysterious man let go of his hands, with a sideways turn, he jumped out of the crowd.</p><br/><p>As he pushed off from stepping off of the shoulders of a few knights, at last, he stopped on a tree.</p><br/><p>\"I told you, you can\u2019t kill me, and it\u2019ll be hard for me to kill you too, so lets just play along for awhile, isn\u2019t that good?\" A lazy sound was heard from beneath the mask.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re a mercenary, aren\u2019t you?\" Grant took a deep breath and said, \"How much commission did that mage pay you? I\u2019ll give you triple of that! As long as you get out of here right now, you\u2019ll get an endless fortune for the rest of your life.\"</p><br/><p>\"Tsk tsk tsk...\" The mysterious man sneered while shaking his head and said, \"For being able to practice my skills with the current pope, the appearance fee would at least be three million? Your Highness the Pope, are you going to give me nine million then? If you can give me that amount now, I\u2019ll leave immediately.\"</p><br/><p>\"You...\"</p><br/><p>Grant was speechless for a while, he could only instruct the knights to continue gushing toward the mysterious man.</p><br/><p>The man, on the other hand, remained calm and fixed his sleeves, before the crowd managed to surround him, he dodged again, turned into an indistinct silhouette, then obstinately continued his offensive attacks.</p><br/><p>Accompanied by the elapse of time, Grant slowly came to a realization that with that much time passed, Benjamin must have already escaped. All the efforts before were gone to waste.</p><br/><p>You vicious man...</p><br/><p>Under the accumulation of his anger, he instructed the knights around him to gradually form an encirclement. At the same time, together with the clustering of the holy light, the gigantic barrier descended from the sky and enveloped everything.</p><br/><p>\"Since you\u2019re so eager to save him, how about you stay here too!\"</p><br/><p>There was a limit to a human\u2019s physical strength, after all the circling, the man\u2019s magic potion would probably be exhausted by now. At that time, even if he underwent the abyss trials, he would only die under the besiege of countless knights.</p><br/><p>However, the mysterious man dodged again and arrived at the border of the barrier.</p><br/><p>\"Boring, boring! Always thinking about killing someone, what\u2019s the fun in there?\"</p><br/><p>Along with a series of rattling, he waved his dagger and slashed the barrier for uncountable times. Moreover, with his natural physique, instantly, a big hole was cut out from the barrier, he flashed out and disappeared from everyone\u2019s vision in a blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>All the knights present were stunned.</p><br/><p>\"Pope, Your Highness the Pope, we...\"</p><br/><p>Grant took a deep breath and, holding back his emotions, said, \"A bunch of you, follow his traces and don\u2019t let him escape just like that. The remaining ones follow me!\"</p><br/><p>As he said that, he flew towards where the alarm went off.</p><br/><p>He could only pray in his heart that Benjamin had not broken out of their seal and that the guarding priests and bishop would be useful and managed to buy him more time.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless...</p><br/><p>There was already a huge hole in the barrier. The corpses of the soldiers were scattered everywhere, all of them died a terrible death, their bodies were stuck with gigantic ice arrows. Some remaining priests were busy treating each other, and as they watched Grant hurrying to the scene, they showed diffident looks one after another.</p><br/><p>\"Your Highness the Pope, we...\"</p><br/><p>\"He escaped?\" Grant interrupted him as he showed an extremely disappointed face.</p><br/><p>\"That devil... he\u2019s too powerful!\" The head priest lowered his head and said, \"But don\u2019t worry, a few bishops are already chasing after him, they won\u2019t let that fellow go so easily!\"</p><br/><p>\"To which direction did they escape?\"</p><br/><p>\"T... To the East.\"</p><br/><p>Grant humphed and did not say anything else, he dashed out from the hole on the barrier instead and chased in that direction.</p><br/><p>It was not easy for him to set such a trap, he was not willing to just let him escape like that, thus, he chased after towards the direction pointed by the priest.</p><br/><p>Except that...</p><br/><p>Ten over minutes later.</p><br/><p>As Grant watched the bodies of those bishops on the ground, he felt powerless and shut his eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

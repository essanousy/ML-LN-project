After all these days, Benjamin\u2019s memory has actually gotten fuzzy. Luckily, Morris had secretly learnt the Church\u2019s techniques. As Benjamin disclosed, he was beside proofreading. It took quite a long time before these blueprints reemerged.</p><br/><p>\"These blueprints can be said to be the Church\u2019s top classified information. I was not worthy enough to even take a glance then.\" Morris sighed reminiscently, \"Just how did you obtain them?\"</p><br/><p>\"Well, just by luck.\"</p><br/><p>If this was before, handing over these blueprints would be given the highest priority of the magic tool department. However, having the research on runes integration right now, these blueprints didn\u2019t seem a big of a deal any longer.</p><br/><p>Hence, they would devote some attention on creating these strategic weapons but most of it would still be focused on researching enhanced magic tools for normal people.</p><br/><p>The latest result was only a defense tool and once they managed to develop an attack weapon and mass produce it too, the black ops\u2019 combat effectiveness would rise to a terrifying stage.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was considering if they should start recruiting mercenaries.</p><br/><p>Of course, these matters should be taken one step at a time. There was no point in rushing. The branch campus matter at hand has yet to find a resolution so it was better to let the people from the magic tool department take their time.</p><br/><p>He quickly found Varys and asked.</p><br/><p>\"The branch campus... How many teachers in total have you recruited?\"</p><br/><p>\"At the moment we only have forty over. However, recruitment is still ongoing. We will have enough people by then.\" Varys reported as he flipped through his booklet.</p><br/><p>\"Find a place, and gather them. I want to have a town hall.\"</p><br/><p>\"Now? Isn\u2019t it too much of a rush?\"</p><br/><p>\"Relax, I have my reasons.\"</p><br/><p>Varys did not comment further. He nodded and arranged accordingly. There were three branch campuses to be built so the mages that were solicited were from various nations and places. But one word, and these people would be willing to assemble at the magic academy.</p><br/><p>About five days later.</p><br/><p>\"Fellow mages, welcome to the Magic Academy.\"</p><br/><p>In one of the empty classroom, Benjamin mounted a platform and stared at the mages below. He swept a glance and smiled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>The mages beneath him all stood in awe.</p><br/><p>However, Benjamin\u2019s tone quickly took a turn, \"Does anyone know, the original intent of me building the magic academy?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes... Spreading the knowledge of magic to provide anyone with talent a learning opportunity?\" One of them thought it over and recited the lines of the slogan of new students. He obviously done his homework.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s the academy\u2019s mission, not the original intent.\" Benjamin shook his head, \"Our intent is simple \u2014 Abolishing the Church.\"</p><br/><p>The mages below the platform were momentarily stunned. They came to accept the position at the branch campus but who expected Benjamin to utter such cold words in seriousness.</p><br/><p>Amongst them, there were a few that had a change in expression, seemingly coming to a realization.</p><br/><p>\"You might wonder, why would I speak such words at the very beginning.\" Benjamin continued, \"The Church has recently kept a low profile in the Kingdom of Helius. We shouldn\u2019t be alarmed. But... While you are in the state of ignorance, they have made their move.\"</p><br/><p>The mages exchanged glances.</p><br/><p>\"Director, you mean...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin smiled and suddenly took out a piece of paper and started to read out. One name after another on the paper, were the names of some of them that were present. For the name of each person that was called out, no matter how seemingly calm, droplets of sweat beaded on their foreheads.</p><br/><p>\u2014 This was a list of spies that the System pried in the elemental plane.</p><br/><p>After he was done, Benjamin put down the paper and lifted his head, \"Those mages whose names I have called out, could you please stand?\"</p><br/><p>After a brief silence, these people slowly rose from their seats. Each of them carried different expressions. Some of them forced a smile and acted casually, \"What\u2019s the matter? Aren't you... recruiting us into your academy?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin smiled at the remark. However, the intensity in the atmosphere could be felt by everyone.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s going on?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don\u2019t know, what does this mean...\"</p><br/><p>Many of them were puzzled and lowered their voice in discussion.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m sure everyone is thrown by this so I won\u2019t waste any more time.\" Benjamin let out a cold snort and all smiles vanished, \"These people are spies sent by the Church. The traitors to the mages. Despicable beings here to steal the secrets of the academy!\"</p><br/><p>In an instant, the classroom burst into an uproar.</p><br/><p>After being seen through, these spies were shock. Some of them reacted fast and quickly demonstrated gestures of innocence, protesting, \"Di-Director... I think there is some misunderstandings?\"</p><br/><p>\"Misunderstanding?\" Benjamin let out a cold laugh, \"Do not think that you guys are the only one that sent spies over, we have our own undercover at the Church. Your names were sought from the Church\u2019s confidential files.\"</p><br/><p>However, these people were overly stubborn.</p><br/><p>\"No! This must be a misunderstanding! Someone is trying to frame us! Director, and fellow mages, you must believe us. We are not some spies sent by the Church!\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright. If you say you aren\u2019t with the Church. Then, summon a simple Grenade of Holy Light.\"</p><br/><p>\"Wh-What?\"</p><br/><p>\"Grenade of Holy Light. The most basic of the beginner level light magic. It is also part of our curriculum.\" Benjamin paced himself, \"Of course, if explained from the Church\u2019s point of view, the Grenade of Holy Light should be a Divine Art. But we have announced before that the Divine Art was a part of magic and the sayings of the Church are not at all, convincing.\"</p><br/><p>These spies\u2019 level of nervousness reached new heights. After exchanging a few glances in the dark, one of them spoke, \"But, we have never practiced the light magic. What if we are unable to summon...\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s fine if you can\u2019t. It\u2019s not like everyone has affinity to the light elements.\" Benjamin shook his head, \"But... stalling for time and unwilling to attempt it. This is quite suspicious.\"</p><br/><p>\"We...\"</p><br/><p>These people wanted to refute further but were cut short by Benjamin, \"I have seen mages nurtured by the Church. They wallowed in lowliness, forever bearing hatred towards their own identities; hence worshipping that fake gauzy god. The beliefs you hold, would not allow you to attempt the light magic \u2014 which is the supposed divine art. Therefore, you see them as they are, full of hesitation.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Did\u2026 Didn\u2019t you say your name was Benjamin?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin let out a bitter smile, \"I don\u2019t know where to begin. Believe me, you wouldn\u2019t want to hear</p><br/><p>the whole story. Just called me \u2018Benjamin\u2019 like before.\"</p><br/><p>\"This...\" Varys massaged his forehead heavily, trying to digest the news.</p><br/><p>Benjamin could only shrug his shoulders.</p><br/><p>He regretted it a little. After all, news does get spread out rather perversely. Who knew what would</p><br/><p>become of the news about huge Water Ball once it had travelled to the borders of the kingdom.</p><br/><p>Sky bestowed flood? Sky bestowed meteor? The war between the gods and the devils? What</p><br/><p>would the people describe him as?</p><br/><p>He should have gathered intel prior to revealing this.</p><br/><p>Having said that, seeing Varys in a state of shock, Benjamin couldn\u2019t help but feel... an odd</p><br/><p>sensation of accomplishment?</p><br/><p>\"I apologise, I... I must have been impolite.\" After a long pause, Varys managed to take a deep</p><br/><p>breath, \"I really didn\u2019t think that the rumoured Water Ball demon would be someone like you... I-I</p><br/><p>was out of line.\"</p><br/><p>Water Ball demon...</p><br/><p>Benjamin felt a slight helplessness.</p><br/><p>What the hell was that?</p><br/><p>\"So... What kind of person was I rumoured to be?\" He couldn\u2019t help but ask.</p><br/><p>\"People were saying that after the fall of Grant, the Divine Arts genius, he grew a third eye and</p><br/><p>lived on human blood. Whoever he gazes at will be frozen into ice sculptures and he drains your</p><br/><p>blood as though drinking ice milk.\" Varys responded.</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was speechless.</p><br/><p>The imagination of the people was really... creative.</p><br/><p>Varys was uncomfortable to the point that he could no longer look Benjamin in the eye. However,</p><br/><p>he slowly adapted and agreed to Benjamin\u2019s plan without protesting stealing the cross.</p><br/><p>Now that the initial plans were established, he could take care of all the intricate details.</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s initial thought was to hide in one of the food sacks and have Varys hand him over to</p><br/><p>the people at the gates. Once he was moved to the kitchen or pantry area, he would sneak out of</p><br/><p>the sack.</p><br/><p>It was a good idea but the issue was that the people tend to check the food when received. So how</p><br/><p>he could hide in the sack without being noticed was the question they had to solve.</p><br/><p>As for escaping from the gates after stealing the cross, it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal. There were two</p><br/><p>thousand over people living there which would obviously produce a lot of waste. The waste is</p><br/><p>packed in a huge cloth bag and thrown to the townies to dispose of.</p><br/><p>Although it did sound a little disgusting, one had to admit that it was a great idea. Nobody would</p><br/><p>actually check garbage, especially those in huge bags. Benjamin could easily be return to town by</p><br/><p>hiding in the garbage bags.</p><br/><p>The hardest question would still be whether he could get pass the food supply checking process.</p><br/><p>Benjamin and Varys spent a lot time debating on this matter.</p><br/><p>\"To be honest, they don\u2019t inspect the food supply strictly. They would only open a couple of bags to</p><br/><p>inspect and check its quality.\" Varys said, \"However, if they think we were cutting corners, they</p><br/><p>would inspect in detail during weighting. If there was a bag whose weight was out of the ordinary,</p><br/><p>they will open it up to investigate.\"</p><br/><p>A person\u2019s body was a lot lighter than wheat. If a person were to smuggle into the sack of wheat,</p><br/><p>they would definitely be found out once if it was weighed.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s true...\" Benjamin nodded, \"But I\u2019m sure you have experience in deceiving them.\"</p><br/><p>Varys was stunned for a moment but nodded without denying it.</p><br/><p>In the end, they devised a plan to use a larger sack and increase the food supply ratio. Then, they</p><br/><p>would fill the sack with denser wheat to allow Benjamin to hide in the sack, without letting the</p><br/><p>weight differ with other sacks, thus allowing Benjamin to slip through the inspection process.</p><br/><p>The plan was now roughly laid out, and just required a few tweaks to refine it. Benjamin left it to</p><br/><p>Varys. After all, he had been in the business for a long time and had a wide range of experience \u2013</p><br/><p>he shouldn\u2019t have any problems. It wasn\u2019t as though Benjamin could be of any help anyway.</p><br/><p>Benjamin then left Varys\u2019 home and returned to the inn to meditate.</p><br/><p>The nit and grit of the work was getting done by one by one as time went by. Varys was busy</p><br/><p>preparing bigger sacks and better-quality wheat. The overall ability of the Mage guild was also on</p><br/><p>the rise. Benjamin was also returning to his original abilities before the rift, through meditation.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, the Water Runes that had exploded had been re-condensed by Benjamin four</p><br/><p>days ago.</p><br/><p>It was complete darkness, as always, in the Space of Consciousness. Three magical runes were</p><br/><p>floating in the air, forming a triangle and shining a beam of magnificent blue light. There were</p><br/><p>countless active water particles surrounding them, like a school of fish swimming around.</p><br/><p>Benjamin felt a sense of what have been lost had now returned and felt grateful.</p><br/><p>Finally... He could use the Water Ball spell.</p><br/><p>It was the first spell he mastered after all. It was also the spell that he understood the most.</p><br/><p>Although its damage was incomparable to the Icebreaking spell series and its flexibility as well as</p><br/><p>functionality could not compare to the Pillar of Steam, this was still, without a doubt the spell he</p><br/><p>was most adept at.</p><br/><p>It was useful in both defence and offence and could create the best-case battle scenario for him. It</p><br/><p>could be that due to the fact that he was highly skilled in the spell that his consumption of Spiritual</p><br/><p>Energy when using Water Ball was less than the other two spells \u2014 In order to create the giant</p><br/><p>Water Ball in the Imperial Capital, he must have used the Water Ball spell at least a few hundred</p><br/><p>thousand times.</p><br/><p>\"Erm... Con-congrats! You\u2019ve recovered your abilities and I-I\u2019m really happy,\" The system</p><br/><p>cringingly bounced forward.</p><br/><p>Benjamin almost laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>Oh, System.</p><br/><p>Ever since System was trapped inside a \"roe\" looking marble, Benjamin found a way to tackle it.</p><br/><p>He could use System as a bouncy ball or as a punching bag. Its elasticity was so good that it</p><br/><p>wouldn\u2019t break no matter how he toyed with it. As such, Benjamin did not hold back on teaching the</p><br/><p>System a lesson.</p><br/><p>The System was no longer as puffed up with arrogance as it once was. He no longer dared to talk</p><br/><p>back to Benjamin. In fact, it sounded like a weakling, as if afraid to provoke Benjamin lest face</p><br/><p>another \"beach volleyball competition\".</p><br/><p>Benjamin was quite satisfied with the state things were now.</p><br/><p>\"When will you change from this roundish thingy?\" Benjamin thought about it and asked, \"I don\u2019t</p><br/><p>expect you to hatch into a high levelled pet monster but if you stay in here, you\u2019re pretty much</p><br/><p>useless. Wouldn\u2019t that be a shame?\"</p><br/><p>\"I have no idea...\" The System now spoke with a tearful voice, \"I can feel something happening</p><br/><p>but each time I scan, the insides of the marble is empty - nada.\"</p><br/><p>... Nothing could be done.</p><br/><p>Benjamin could only shrug it off.</p><br/><p>It should be something big, seeing that it came exploding from the Pure Blue world. Since the</p><br/><p>System said some change was happening, they should just wait. One day, the change would</p><br/><p>eventually be visible. It wasn\u2019t as though he depended on it to hatch into a dragon and ride him to</p><br/><p>conquer the world or something.</p><br/><p>He had previously tried to, but couldn\u2019t, bring the little thing out of the Space of Consciousness.</p><br/><p>Breeding a pet monster with fighting abilities would have been a great idea.</p><br/><p>Benjamin quickly left the System who was resentful and filled with dread to meditate.</p><br/><p>Time went by.</p><br/><p>Everything was peaceful right up to the afternoon of the fifth day, when he suddenly received news</p><br/><p>from a fellow Mage.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

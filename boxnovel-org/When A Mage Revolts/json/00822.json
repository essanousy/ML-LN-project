Director, sir\u2026\"</p><br/><p>However, Benjamin immediately interrupted them, speaking firmly, \"Enough. Do you guys still doubt my abilities? Take Miles and get away quickly. This is my peremptory command as director. If you don't wish to be expelled from the academy, do as I say!\"</p><br/><p>The mages were about to protest further, but were still finally shaken by Benjamin's stubborn attitude. After exchanging looks with one another, they packed up their stunning laboratory equipment and flew towards the outside of the netherworld with Miles in tow.</p><br/><p>\"Director, you must return to us safely!\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin turned around, listening to the mages flying off further and further away from him. He did not reply and only nodded.</p><br/><p>Casting another glance at the bone dragon, which was pursuing him in the distance, he summoned the water elemental sprite and placed it upon his shoulder before flying off into another direction alone.</p><br/><p>The moment the fleeing team split into two, the bone dragon had an apparent moment of hesitation.</p><br/><p>Benjamin hurriedly turned his head and drew out the Elemental Order - Heal, using the healing drizzle to shroud the gigantic body of the bone dragon once again. The water elemental sprite on his shoulder flew up as well, shooting out a few strands of water silks. The bone dragon's attention was immediately captured.</p><br/><p>\"Continue to abuse a power that is not yours, and a terrible evil shall befall you.\" The voice of the soul of bones rang out once more. It was very clear that the existence of the water elemental sprite was the one thing that irked it the most.</p><br/><p>Instantly, it changed its direction and headed straight for Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"...We have successfully lured the monster.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shrugged and, while muttering to himself, burst out in his highest speed. No longer having to drag the other mages and Miles along, he was without any tiresome burdens. Like a meteor, he swooshed towards the southwest!</p><br/><p>The alarm left in his subconscious by the organisms from the higher dimensions was ringing nonstop. Nevertheless, Benjamin had slowly gotten used to ignoring it. He could not deal with too many matters at a time. Right then, all he could do was to focus on escaping.</p><br/><p>\"I have a very bad feeling about this.\" The System's tone was ice cold.</p><br/><p>\"Oh.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin continued to fly forwards, as he had been doing.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, he felt the ground beneath him shaking unexpectedly. Not unlike his previous experience in the white bone forest, numerous rotting corpses and skeletons emerged from the ground constantly, before exploding without warning. Wafts of black aura were all that was left, rising out from the corpses that littered the ground before flying towards the bone dragon.</p><br/><p>Subsequently, the aura of the bone dragon became stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>After about fifteen minutes of pursuit, Benjamin realized that the Elemental Order - Heal was no longer able to hinder the movements of the bone dragon. At the moment, the bone dragon was entirely covered in a layer of black light. Flying in the air, it looked like a gigantic, oval black hole, rushing over with overwhelming and unmatched power!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, its speed increased along with the strengthening of its power.</p><br/><p>\"...You're right, I can probably last for another half a minute.\" Benjamin was forced to admit, in his heart, that the System had been right.</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that he truly appreciated what it meant to go against the entire netherworld. He had completely given up the idea of fighting the bone dragon head on, and the only intention in his mind right then was to run.</p><br/><p>All water elements were being condensed by him into water vapour, pushing his thing and fragile body onward continuously. He even had to add an extra layer of protection around him, or the friction in the air under speeds that surpassed even the speed of sound would instantly tear him into pieces.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 The bone dragon was still faster than he was.</p><br/><p>\"It's coming.\"</p><br/><p>As the System sounded an alert, the bone dragon opened up its jaws and spewed out a greyish white pillar of fire between its breaths. Benjamin hurriedly flashed sideways, but by doing so, the distance between him and the bone dragon was shortened!</p><br/><p>Benjamin turned his head. The gigantic bone dragon looked like a meteorite from outer space, growing larger and larger in his vision.</p><br/><p>In the next second, the bone dragon lifted up its front claws and swung them down violently!</p><br/><p>Swoosh!</p><br/><p>An instant illusion appeared upon Benjamin's body, and the humongous dragon claws passed through him without coming into contact with anything solid. The bone dragon was startled, and Benjamin took the opportunity to increase his speed. In just a turn, he managed to pull away into a distance of a hundred meters.</p><br/><p>\"You've just spent 0.4 seconds of intangible time. Note that you only have 13.2 seconds of usable intangible time left.\" The System reminded.</p><br/><p>\"Understood!\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin replied in his heart while raising his hand, throwing the water elemental sprite in it towards the bone dragon. He yelled loudly, \"Delay it!\"</p><br/><p>With a whoosh, the water elemental sprite disappeared from his view.</p><br/><p>Instantly, there was a shocking roar of fury from the bone dragon. Benjamin could not see what had happened clearly, but with a violent ripple of elemental oscillation, the enemy's pursuit was halted for a few moments.</p><br/><p>Right after that, there was an extremely frightening explosion.</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The water elemental sprite seemed to have created a terrible blast near the bone dragon. Even Benjamin, who was a few hundred meters away, felt his ears ringing from the explosion. Within the next second, a lump of mysterious thing shot back towards Benjamin with a whoosh, like a bullet.</p><br/><p>It should be the water elemental sprite. However, this time, it had lost its originally delicate features. Unshaped, it was like a mash of blue meatball. Benjamin could feel exhaustion and pain through the spiritual connection.</p><br/><p>Benjamin hurriedly stowed it back into his space of consciousness.</p><br/><p>However, taking advantage of the extra time the water elemental sprite had managed to buy for him, the distance between the bone dragon and himself was once again increased, this time to almost a thousand meters. Chances of a successful escape grew greater.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Roar!\"</p><br/><p>The roar of the bone dragon rang out from far behind him. In that same moment, Benjamin suddenly felt a powerful energy squeezing in from all directions. It was as though the space around him had suddenly been distorted. His high speed flight halted as he was promptly stuck on the spot, unable to move.</p><br/><p>What was happening?</p><br/><p>Benjamin was shocked.</p><br/><p>This was an extremely strange situation, as though the pause button on only his time had been pressed. Except for his mental processes, he was unable to blink nor breathe. Even his heartbeat and blood flow had been stopped.</p><br/><p>\"You're finished. You've attracted the backlash of the laws of the planes.\" The System spoke in exasperation, \"Told you to not be so high profile, but you ended up escaping in such a spectacular manner anyway. Now you've gone too far.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin did not say anything. He could only stare with his eyes wide open, stunned and rooted to the spot, as the bone dragon lumbered up before him.</p><br/><p>However, the bone dragon did not immediately strike him. That surprised him slightly.</p><br/><p>\"Do you still not understand? That power is not allowed in the world of the dead.\" The voice of the soul of bones suddenly came out, \"This is the resting place of souls and elements, and you have disturbed too many things.\"</p><br/><p>\"...Kill me if you can.\" Benjamin was unable to open his mouth, so he could only retort in his heart.</p><br/><p>\"I will not kill you.\" The soul of bones, however, spoke in a merciless, haughty tone, \"You have already been bound by the laws. In this world, no one can ever touch you again. You have been isolated by this world, and your time will forever be fixed upon this second, halted in the skies for eternity.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

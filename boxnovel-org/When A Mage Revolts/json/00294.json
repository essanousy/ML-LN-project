He then turned to bring the fainted captive to lord knight Lance\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>He had a change of plans. Since he wouldn\u2019t be able to capture the two other men in black, he wouldn\u2019t be able to frame the cult anymore. Hence, the original plan was now useless.</p><br/><p>Benjamin now had more important matters to attend to.</p><br/><p>On one hand he was tricked by the three men but on the other, he had obtained a lot of information. An entirely new plan started to form within him.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t need to frame the cult. These people were dirty enough.</p><br/><p>Benjamin quickened his place and reached his destination before long.</p><br/><p>\"Quick! I am the mage that came here a few days ago. Please inform Lord Knight Lance that I have a decisive clue that could help him crack the case!\"</p><br/><p>The soldiers guarding the entrance looked at Benjamin and then at the man in black that was bounded by magic in mid-air. They were a little confused.</p><br/><p>\"What are you standing around for? Quickly inform the Sir Lord Knight!\"</p><br/><p>The soldiers came to their senses and hurriedly nodded. They turned and ran inside.</p><br/><p>Benjamin couldn\u2019t help but shake his head. Time was a wasting and who knew what was happening within the cult. He didn\u2019t want to waste my time and rushed inside with the man once they had opened the gates.</p><br/><p>Passing through the corridors, he quickly found Lord Knight Lance who had just finished his meal.</p><br/><p>\"Sir Lord Knight, I have an important clue there that you must listen to.\" Benjamin immediately pushed open the dining hall\u2019s door, ignoring the soldiers stopping him at the entrance and walked in.</p><br/><p>\"You... are the mage from the other day?\" Lance looked surprised. He wiped his mouth and frowned, \"What\u2019s the rush? What happened? And... Who is that man in black?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin tossed the man onto the ground and snorted, \"This is the man was they sent to assassinate me.\"</p><br/><p>Lance was caught off guard.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re saying that the cult is under investigation? How can that be?\" He quickly got up and walked to the man. He took off the veil covering the man\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>His face immediately changed.</p><br/><p>\"Sir Lord Knight... This man is really the guy from those streets.\" The solider beside him cried, \"He was a worker at the temple. We had a word with him before!\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Benjamin felt that even the heavens were helping him. He need not say more since they could recognize him.</p><br/><p>This small-scale cult would not use someone from the outside to do their dirty work, they would surely use their own members. Since Lance\u2019s men managed to recognize this man in black, well, he could only blame his own dumb luck.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s right... we have spoken with him before.\" Lance looked at the man\u2019s face and nodded, \"Sir Mage, we have a pressing issue at hand. Could you permit me to bring him to the basement for interrogation?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded, \"But of course.\"</p><br/><p>Without even removing the serviette placed around his neck, he dragged the man down to the basement to start the interrogation. As for Benjamin? Naturally, he wouldn\u2019t be able to join the interrogation, so he merely sat down at the dining hall enjoying a glass of wine to him by a soldier.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have to wait long.</p><br/><p>\"Isn\u2019t this Mage Benjamin? Welcome, welcome. Why didn\u2019t you let us know of your arrival?\" A happy Inspector Mikel popped in after hearing of Benjamin\u2019s presence from who knows where.</p><br/><p>Benjamin wasn\u2019t the least bit impatient, he smiled back, \"Sir Mikel, we meet again.\"</p><br/><p>Mikel walked over and sat next to him. He asked curiously, \"Sir Benjamin, I heard you have brought over a weird man in black and found a really important clue. Is that true?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded, \"That\u2019s right. Lord Knight Lance is on it. He is currently interrogating him in the basement.\"</p><br/><p>\"What? He...\" Mikel immediately looked a little dissatisfied. However, he quickly regained his composure, \"What really happened? Sir Benjamin, could you let me know?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin smiled, \"Yes, of course.\"</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, he intended to walk Mikel through the whole ordeal.</p><br/><p>Instincts told Benjamin that although the lead investigator was Lance, Mikel had influence and power over the political side. Hence, Mikel was the man to speak to.</p><br/><p>\"I had mentioned to Sir before that I wasn\u2019t on good terms with the cult. You know that, right?\" He spoke with great solemn, \"I could never have imagined that this evening, they would send a man to assassinate me. If it wasn\u2019t because of my agile Spiritual Energy, I wouldn't be able to make it out alive. While escaping, I actually caught one of the assassins!\"</p><br/><p>\"What? Are you okay, sir?\" Mikel looked surprised. Whether or not it was genuine or just polite, no one would know.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t worry, sir. They won\u2019t be able to harm me.\" Benjamin said with vigor, \"I believe you have asked the Mage Freemasonry over these past few days about the ruins, as well as the danger of the cult? Surely, they must have warned you.\"</p><br/><p>Mikel sighed and nodded.</p><br/><p>Benjamin took the opportunity to press on, \"If that\u2019s the case, why are we allowing such a cult to exist within Fereldan? If this continues, we could be the next Kingdom of Helius.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sir Benjamin, I understand where you\u2019re coming from.\" Mikel shook his head, \"It\u2019s just that to put the cult on the ban list, is a complicated matter.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin could sense the heaviness in his tactful tone.</p><br/><p>\"Having discovered ruins with high danger, inclination to develop armed forces and sending assassins to threaten the wellbeing of mages, aren\u2019t these reasons enough?\" He asked with knitted brows.</p><br/><p>\"Of course, they are. But Sir, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t trust you, but you don\u2019t have proof.\" Mikel patted Benjamin\u2019s shoulder, \"The Mages Freemasonry were ambitious in their statement. Although it did coincide with what you said after working with them, but they were unwilling act as witnesses. There is nothing much we could do.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was caught in a rut.</p><br/><p>Ambitious statement? Unwilling to become witnesses?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t think of any reason the Mages Freemasonry was so jittery. Abolishing the cult was only beneficial to the mages. Perhaps they were unaware of the seriousness of the issue or they wouldn\u2019t be so nonchalant about it.</p><br/><p>It looked like the few freemasonry members that he had rescued from the ruins had limited say in the group.</p><br/><p>At least... not as influential as Mage Vinci.</p><br/><p>Benjamin found it hard to swallow this fact.</p><br/><p>Here he was, scratching head to help all mages to abolish a mutual enemy before it developed, while the mages freemasonry on the other hand, who supposedly worked toward the benefit of mages, struggled with its internal politics and refused to cooperate.</p><br/><p>How... disappointing.</p><br/><p>No wonder during the divide of the empire, the mage guild took all the goods and left only the tattered literature to them \u2014 who wouldn\u2019t take advantage of their cowardly attitude?</p><br/><p>\"But, I have now caught one of their men; this could count as evidence, right?\" Benjamin shook his head and pressed the matter further.</p><br/><p>Mikel nodded perplexingly. He was about to comment when his eyes changed, and he looked behind Benjamin.</p><br/><p>Benjamin noticed the change and turned his head.</p><br/><p>At the entrance of the dining hall, Lord Knight Lance slowly walked in \u2013 his face was stone-cold serious. It looked like he was done with the interrogation.</p><br/><p>... What could he interrogate in such a short time frame?</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, Benjamin did not have much hope but asked anyway, \"Sir Lord Knight, what did you manage to find out?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She wiped away her tears and got off the ground, bowed low to the royalty and said, \"the princess's cat went missing and so I tried to find it for her. But when I finally found the cat and brought it to her room, a black shadow charged out of the room. I got a fright and immediately ran into the room again, but the princess was gone.\"</p><br/><p>\"This just happened?\" The king asked immediately.</p><br/><p>The servant girl nodded and said, \"I ran here immediately to tell you.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, the faces in the crowd changed.</p><br/><p>If the servant girl was right, then someone was hiding in the palace to kidnap the princess when the lights went out and the assassination attempt was made on the king.</p><br/><p>That meant that the king's almost assassination was just a distraction. The princess was the real goal.</p><br/><p>Benjamin sighed deeply.</p><br/><p>He didn't understand why someone would plot this but it must have been planned a long time ahead. For someone to assassinate the king and kidnap the princess, they had to be very familiar with the layout of the palace to be able to get away with it.</p><br/><p>\"I'm sorry that our banquet turned out like this.\" The king said, turning around to look at Benjamin and Aldrich, \"I need to leave.\"</p><br/><p>He turned away and gestured for General Barrett to follow him. From the looks of things, they were going to prepare the army to get the princess back.</p><br/><p>\"Your Majesty, wait.\" Aldrich said, \"the guy who attacked us just now used magic, there must be some magical involvement. I should follow you, your Majesty, just in case.\"</p><br/><p>The king thought about it and agreed, \"hmm, that is a good idea, then I'll get mage Aldrich to protect me. Mage Benjamin, your skills are amazing, but that is enough. We needn't bother you with other matters.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin heard all this but he hesitated.</p><br/><p>He initially decided to follow Aldrich and to step forward and save the princess. The thing was, the System suddenly opened its mouth and said something to Benjamin and he started to doubt.</p><br/><p>He had met the little girl before and he didn't want her to be taken.</p><br/><p>But...</p><br/><p>\"Your Majesty, why don't you let me protect you. You saw that I am able to see the enemy even in the darkness.\" Benjamin said, \"Mage Aldrich, you should contact the Mage Freemasonry and tell them to look for the princess' kidnapper. That would be more effective.\"</p><br/><p>\"This...\" Aldrich was dumbfounded, as though he was worried about allowing Benjamin to protect his king.</p><br/><p>\"It's alright, you should contact the people of the Mage Freemasonry, the mage Benjamin can protect me.\" The king said after looking at Benjamin for a moment.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Benjamin let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Because the king had spoken, Aldrich couldn't fight against the word of the king.</p><br/><p>\"Since you have said so then so be it.\" He nodded and turned to leave the palace.</p><br/><p>As for Benjamin, he bowed his head and followed the king, and together with the king's private guard and the General, they headed away.</p><br/><p>While they were on their way.</p><br/><p>\"Are you sure you're right?\" Benjamin asked the System suspiciously.</p><br/><p>\"Of course, when have I ever led you astray.\" The System huffed indignantly and said, \"the assassin you sensed behind the mask was exactly the same as one of the mages that you sensed in the secret room at the Mages Freemasonry.</p><br/><p>\"Are you sure?\" Benjamin had to ask again.</p><br/><p>\"I'm sure.\" The System added, \"don't talk about the face, even the body was the same. Didn't you see with your own eyes? How can you not remember now?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin heard and shook his head, he could only laugh bitterly.</p><br/><p>Yes, he saw it with his own eyes, and he did have some impression of it.</p><br/><p>However what it actually meant was really shocking, and the consequences were massive. So he had to confirm it again and again and it was difficult to shake the shock from his chest. After a moment of confirming and reconfirming, he slowly accepted this reality.</p><br/><p>The assassin that just tried to assassinate the king was at a secret \"no outsiders allowed\" meeting with other mercenaries listening to a bald man speak earlier in the afternoon.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>The mastermind behind everything that just happened was none other than Aldrich who just had a meal with them. He is the one who leads the Mages Freemasonry.</p><br/><p>How insulting.</p><br/><p>Just now at the dinner table, the king had just praised Aldrich and the other mages from the Mages Freemasonry saying that they were the rock of the country, the heroes of history. In the end, the Mages Freemasonry sent people to assassinate the king and kidnap the princess.</p><br/><p>Luckily Benjamin had been through quite a bit and he had experience in these things. Otherwise, he would be sweating bullets right about now.</p><br/><p>They were in real deep waters now! Vecause of this, at the dining hall Benjamin suggested that he be the one to protect the king. Honestly, who knew what would happen if Aldrich was the one who was protecting the king?</p><br/><p>Ferelden didn't need a royal funeral right now.</p><br/><p>Actually, Benjamin didn't want to get involved in this kind of complicated battle. The thing was, he wasn't sure what was the Mages Freemasonry's true purpose. Did they want to seize the throne? Didn't Aldrich already have a seat of power? Or was there someone directing them from behind?</p><br/><p>Benjamin wasn't sure about all of this, but he felt that Ferelden was already good enough right now.</p><br/><p>Under the reign of this king, it was much more stable compared to before. He could lead the mages under his care to greater heights, but once there is a change in government, no one knows if they can peacefully and stably expand</p><br/><p>They\u2019ve only just arrived at the city of Rayleigh, who would even want to run for their lives so soon?</p><br/><p>So, even if Benjamin did not want anything to happen to him, he could only stand up and courageously protect the king. He would not allow Aldrich to ever be alone with the king under any circumstances.</p><br/><p>He thought about the different connections occurring behind the scenes as he walked with the king. After a few minutes, they came to a place that looked like a boardroom.</p><br/><p>And there were already many officials gathered in the boardroom.</p><br/><p>Benjamin even saw Mikel and Knight Lance.</p><br/><p>Of course, when they saw Benjamin walking out with the king, both Mikel and Lance were a little stunned.</p><br/><p>\"Send out the notice immediately, temporarily seal the entire city of Snow.\" The king stood beside the throne and said coldly, \"Knight Lance, you lead a thousand soldiers. Set up traps around the city. Watch every person on the streets, don\u2019t let the guy who kidnapped the princess to get away.\"</p><br/><p>\"Sir yes, sir!\" Lance bowed and turned and quickly got to work.</p><br/><p>\"General Barrett, you lead three thousand soldiers, and carry out a search of the internal city...\"</p><br/><p>Mikel, you go to the city and look for any related news...\"</p><br/><p>The king delegated task after task and orders, all of them related to looking for the princess. And Benjamin stood to the side as a bodyguard, his heart was in bundles.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t even made a decision yet.</p><br/><p>In the end... should he let the king know that the Mages Freemasonry wanted to commit treason?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

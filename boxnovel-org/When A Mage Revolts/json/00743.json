The fight between the mages and the bishop was just about to intensify, and chaotic magical fluctuations were spreading out from the room.</p><br/><p>\"When you get closer, try to control the bishop's mind with your spell,\" Benjamin did not rush into the room, instead, he whispered to the girl.</p><br/><p>\"This... his spiritual energy seems to be very powerful, I might not be able to control him.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin frowned.</p><br/><p>If he was not able to get information by controlling the Bishop, it would be a little troublesome.</p><br/><p>However, since it was urgent, there was no time to think that much, so he immediately flew into the study room.</p><br/><p>In the study room, more than a dozen of mages formed a large circle, countless spells were cast out of their hands and launched towards the bishop in the middle. The bishop was holding a staff covered in crystal. While gathering a large amount of holy light, he was trying to defend and also attack.</p><br/><p>The overall situation was favoring the mages, even if Benjamin did not join in, the Bishop would not last any longer.</p><br/><p>\"... Mage Benjamin, I did not expect you to come so soon.\"</p><br/><p>Through the layers of holy light clashing with magic, the Bishop\u2019s gaze fell on Benjamin, and his voice sounded calm.</p><br/><p>\"There are so much more which you did not expect!\" Benjamin uttered a cold sneer, waved his hand and summoned dozens of long ice spears, \"Die! You will never be able to take Icor!\"</p><br/><p>Subsequently, the long ice spears were launched towards the barrier that the Bishop made and made a deep cut!</p><br/><p>The dazzling holy light began to tremble instantly.</p><br/><p>The Bishop saw this, something flashed in his eyes, and he suddenly pulled out a strangely-shaped cross from his robe. As he crushed the cross, a burst of dazzling holy light suddenly appeared on the Bishop, it blinded everyone's sight and repelled the water elements, even Benjamin could not sense his movements.</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s trying to escape! Stop him!\"</p><br/><p>Joanna froze for a moment and immediately shouted.</p><br/><p>Although the mages could not see anything, they cast a spell together and instantly built a layer of magic barrier. Fire, ice, rocks... Despite how powerful the Bishop's magical tool was, it will be impossible to break out of these barriers!</p><br/><p>As for Benjamin, he took the opportunity to summon a few water streams, got ready to trap the Bishop in an anti-magic bubble, and then torture him to find out where the Guild Master was being sent to.</p><br/><p>However...</p><br/><p>Splat!</p><br/><p>A light sound came from the cross that was radiating with holy light, it was as though a flesh was being burst apart. At that moment, all the mages were surprised.</p><br/><p>Benjamin seemed to have thought of something, and his face changed instantly, he drew a rune and used his fastest speed to cast an Elemental Order \u2022 Heal.</p><br/><p>However, his reaction seemed to be a little too late.</p><br/><p>\"S-stop dreaming\u2026 you will never know where we kept him.\"</p><br/><p>Accompanied by a weak and hateful sentence, the glaring holy light gradually disappeared, and the constantly fluctuating elements started calming down. Subsequently, everyone finally got to see what happened clearly.</p><br/><p>He saw the bishop lying there, his left hand holding a dagger tightly, and stabbed it into his chest. The mages gasped, only Benjamin was trying to hurriedly draw the rune.</p><br/><p>However, when the rain started falling, the Bishop had already passed.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the atmosphere of the entire study room was dead silent.</p><br/><p>\"Director Benjamin...\"</p><br/><p>After it was silent for a moment, Lara spoke, and hesitantly said something, but was suddenly interrupted by Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"Forget about him, go to the prison of Regina and release all the officers being trapped there!\" Benjamin took a deep breath and said quickly, \"We must calm the coup as soon as possible to get Regina back to operating normally.\"</p><br/><p>The moment the Bishop died, he realizes that it might be difficult for him to rescue the Guild Master.</p><br/><p>He was filled with a helplessness and felt his chest tightening. However... the pressure of the reality promptly pulled him back to his senses, and he could not waste any more time mourning the Guild Master.</p><br/><p>Icor's military layout was mostly done by the Guild Master, other than him, there were also some other people who were responsible for it. However, since it was urgent, the Church must not make use of the Guild Master to get into contact with the 100,000 soldiers and destroy such a huge army that easily.</p><br/><p>From the information that he got using the girl\u2019s magic, the uncooperative officers in Icor were being thrown into jail, and they need to be rescued.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the mages left the palace and rushed to the jail. Benjamin flew up to the sky, headed towards the direction of the border and killed all the priests he saw on the way there.</p><br/><p>The streets were still in chaos. However, the people from the Church seemed to have gotten an order, and they began to retreat.</p><br/><p>Obviously, they understood that it was impossible to directly take over Regina through a coup. Although Benjamin did not know how they communicated, the death of the Bishop was somehow spread to all the priests.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Benjamin did not need to worry about Regina's situation, the coup calming down was an inevitable result.</p><br/><p>He quickly left and headed west.</p><br/><p>No matter where the Guild Master was being sent to, without a doubt, they will eventually head towards the west, near the border of Icor and then use the Guild Master to lower the guard of the 100,000 soldiers.</p><br/><p>Benjamin did not want to give up so easily, therefore, he intended to do something about it. If the Church did not get too far, by searching at lower altitude, he should be able to find some clues.</p><br/><p>\"Quick, scan it with me, all the pedestrians, the traveling merchants... every one of them, scan them clearly for me, the people from the Church might be disguising themselves and are hiding among them.\" He looks for the other side Told in my heart.</p><br/><p>\"I think there isn\u2019t much hope,\" The System said lazily, \"The borderline is so long that they could have countless ways to get there, let alone some routes that cannot be considered as \u2018roads\u2019, it is like fishing a needle out of the sea. Moreover, even if you search every possible route, if they decide to make a detour, you will definitely not be able to catch them. \"</p><br/><p>\"Just do it and stop the nonsense,\" Benjamin answered coldly.</p><br/><p>The System kept quiet for a moment and said helplessly, \"Humans...\"</p><br/><p>With that, they searched the entire place for two hours, Benjamin inspected thousands of kilometer squares. However, just like what the System said, they did not find any clues.</p><br/><p>Under the dark night, it was so quiet that it was as though they were at an execution ground.</p><br/><p>In the end, Benjamin stopped in the air, took a deep breath and flew back to Regina with a heavy heart.</p><br/><p>\u2026He was hoping that within these two hours, Regina had already returned back to normal and the trapped officers were being rescued.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

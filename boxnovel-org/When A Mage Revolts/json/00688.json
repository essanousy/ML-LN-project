Only Benjamin, who had disguised himself as a personal guard, stood outside the bedroom. He turned his head toward the direction of the door and softly spoke.</p><br/><p>\"Then, then you should make haste and apprehend them!\" The king\u2019s voice came from inside, his tone revealing his panic.</p><br/><p>Benjamin reassured him, \"Fret not Your Majesty, I won\u2019t allow you to get in any genuine danger.\"</p><br/><p>After this, he and the System got back to tracking the two people\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>Around the time that the sister and brother had controlled the guards through magic, the System detected their presence. Once the System had relayed the news, Benjamin immediately went on high alert. The enemy had arrived earlier than he had expected, he had thought that this humdrum guardsman life would have lasted for another half month or so.</p><br/><p>But, from the look of things, these two must have hidden in Gealorre from early on.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was already feeling crappy after unintentionally ending Spencer\u2019s life without extracting any information. Now that these two bastards had walked straight into his hands, there was no way he would miss this chance to find out everything about their spellcasting techniques.</p><br/><p>\"Their spiritual energies, how are they?\" As Benjamin observed, he asked in his mind.</p><br/><p>\"Very interesting.\" The System spoke to himself, \"Their spiritual energies definitely seem like they are from the elemental plane, it\u2019s just that\u2026 they seemed to have gone through some modifications. Their spiritual energy possesses an extraordinary frequency that even I myself would not have detected if I were not analyzing them in detail.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin listened, his hand stroking his chin as he thought about the information.</p><br/><p>Frequency\u2026 huh?</p><br/><p>Yet another new concept to delve deep into thought about.</p><br/><p>\"How did they alter their spiritual energy frequencies?\" He asked in his mind, \"The spiritual energy frequencies for each and every living being should be constant, shouldn\u2019t it?\"</p><br/><p>The System replied with a sigh, \"Of course there will be variances; an advanced lifeform such as myself would emit a totally different frequency from you humans.\"</p><br/><p>\".....\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head then closed his eyes and concentrated on sensing the spiritual energy frequencies of those two people.</p><br/><p>Truth to be told, he couldn\u2019t really sense anything from those two. Perhaps it was as the System had said, that Benjamin and their spiritual energy didn\u2019t share the same frequency. As such, their spiritual energy didn\u2019t resonate with his, meaning Benjamin could not detect anything.</p><br/><p>But\u2026 how did these people with abnormal frequencies control the guards\u2019 spiritual energy?</p><br/><p>He was at a loss.</p><br/><p>From what Benjamin could understand, the sister and brother had already managed to get through the surrounding guardsmen and successfully sneak into the palace halls.</p><br/><p>In truth, the king had already loosened the security in secret to lure the foreign cult members in, otherwise those two would not have had such an easy time. Now they were traveling down the empty hallways, without a single servant in sight - perhaps they were \"too lucky\".</p><br/><p>Benjamin was concerned that this trap might have been too obvious and worried about whether the enemy would realize it. But as always, he was just overthinking things: those two weren\u2019t the least bit suspicious of the possibility of them falling into a potential trap.</p><br/><p>Moreover, these two were fairly young children\u2026</p><br/><p>Benjamin couldn\u2019t help but question why this cult had sent children out to do their dirty work. Were they really that short-handed?</p><br/><p>At the same time.</p><br/><p>The two siblings hadn\u2019t noticed the numerous pairs of eyes following them in the shadows. They followed the trail Spencer had left for them and stealthily made their way toward the king\u2019s bedchamber.</p><br/><p>\"Sis\u2026 I feel off about this.\" While moving, the young boy couldn\u2019t help but whisper, \"In such a grandeur palace, how can there not be any servants around. Could this be a trap?\"</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s are you talking about? Our Goddess is helping us!\" The young girl turned to him and rolled her eyes, \"I told you earlier that our Goddess is secretly helping us if you still don\u2019t believe me\u2026 are you aware that you\u2019re disrespecting our Goddess?\"</p><br/><p>\"I, I was wrong.\"</p><br/><p>\"Good, now enough talk, we\u2019re almost there.\"</p><br/><p>The king\u2019s bedchamber lay deep within the palace, but since they had received \"divine assistance\", they naturally arrived there rather quickly. Around ten minutes later, they stood on the third floor, at the end of the hallway which led to the king\u2019s bedchamber.</p><br/><p>\"Hold on! It\u2026 looks like someone\u2019s there!\"</p><br/><p>Upon peeking around the corner, the young girl immediately backed out and whispered to the young boy.</p><br/><p>\"Is that the king\u2019s personal guard?\" The young boy panicked and softly asked, \"Did he see you? This isn\u2019t good\u2026 we, we should quickly get out here!\"</p><br/><p>\"Shhhh\u2026...\"</p><br/><p>The young girl leaned out for another peek, then turned around and motioned for the young boy. Soon after, she nonchalantly walked out of the corner.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, the young boy was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"Wha\u2026 what are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>The young girl just chuckled.</p><br/><p>\"Oh, come on now, don\u2019t be scared.\" She waved towards the young boy as she whispered, \"Look, the king\u2019s personal guard over there has already fallen asleep against the wall!\"</p><br/><p>The young boy was hesitant, but under the young girl\u2019s insistence, nervously stepped out. Then, he lifted his head in the direction that the girl was pointing and saw a figure leaning against the wall.</p><br/><p>At that moment, his expression was that of absolute disbelief.</p><br/><p>\"To think\u2026 to think that he could even fall asleep at a time like this?\" He scratched the back of his head, \"And here I was, thinking that to become the king\u2019s personal guard, one had to be extremely impressive.\"</p><br/><p>The young girl patted his shoulder and said in a solemn tone, \"All of this is the Goddess\u2019s will.\"</p><br/><p>The young boy listened, took a deep breath, and began to clasp his hands together in a praying stance. After experiencing all this, little by little he began to believe in the results they had encountered earlier\u2014 on this night, they would definitely succeed in gaining control over the king of Carretas.</p><br/><p>After that, they tip-toed their way forward.</p><br/><p>Upon reaching the sleeping guardsman\u2019s side, the two inspected him closer; they could even hear a light snore from the guard\u2019s mouth. The young girl looked like she was holding back a laugh, however, she quickly turned to the young boy and motioned her finger across her throat.</p><br/><p>\u2014 Should we quickly take out this eyesore?</p><br/><p>The young boy immediately shook his head.</p><br/><p>\"Controlling the king would be enough, let\u2019s not cause any more problems for ourselves,\" He did his best to exaggerate his lip movements, and mouthed out his message. The young girl observed the situation at hand and shrugged, showing no signs of objection.</p><br/><p>They turned around, with their backs facing the sleeping guardsman, then headed toward the door to the king\u2019s bedchamber.</p><br/><p>The big door was locked and the two did not possess the key to unlock it. However, the young boy hastily took out a few metal strands from his waist pocket and intricately slipped them into the keyhole. A few soft clicks after, the secured door creaked open.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, the young girl eyes lit up in delight.</p><br/><p>Almost there\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, she didn\u2019t think that this whole process would go so smoothly. As such, she was already prepared to sacrifice herself in the event that the mage that even the high priest couldn\u2019t defeat shows up.</p><br/><p>But, they had not seen a single mage throughout their time here.</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t this too easy? How idiotic could that Ben-whatever mage be? Did he truly believe that the king would be safe once he got rid of the high priest?</p><br/><p>The moment when she thought about this\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Such young children shouldn\u2019t be involving themselves in such heinous crimes,\" a mischievous voice came from behind them, immediately petrifying them with fear.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

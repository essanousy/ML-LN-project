Since the three runes had combined into one, the form here slowly began to stabilize. Other than the water elements accumulating more and more, it had been a long time since there were any other changes.</p><br/><p>Even if Benjamin knew the importance of the accumulation, he could not help but feel a bit impatient.</p><br/><p>Would he forever be stuck in this place?</p><br/><p>If, previously, it was that he could still bear it, then now, after obtaining so many new things from the worshippers across the sea, that power-seeking heart of his involuntarily became even more agitated.</p><br/><p>\"About those runes, have you analyzed and come across anything new?\" He suddenly opened his mouth, asking the System.</p><br/><p>Tens of smiley faces jumped and leaped about, surrounding him, and the robotic voice came from all directions, \"Not much, I only know that they have to do with spiritual energy. If you try to draw it out, it might help your spiritual energy become stronger, but it might also possibly\u2026 Cause you to be immediately handicapped of all ability to cast spells.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was somewhat astonished, \"Immediately handicapped? Is it that dangerous?\"</p><br/><p>\"Those stone slates are definitely related to the training of psychic powers, and those shamans could control the mental structure of the elemental world. So chances are, all of that has got to do with the runes on the slates,\" The System chatted with composure, \"Knowing that magic and psychic powers repel each other, of course, there would be the possibility of such a result.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Benjamin\u2019s agitated emotions were slowly being pressed down, but\u2026 He was still somewhat dissatisfied.</p><br/><p>After meditating for so long, the pyramid of runes that had been put together had, indeed, grown a bit stronger, but his powers did not seem to be improving and were instead progressing as slow as a tortoise crawling.</p><br/><p>At the same time, every one of the mages in the academy, because of learning the runic law of meditation, seemed to have been reborn. It was not just Joanna; the magic of many people was improving speedily, and, at a certain level, was stressing Benjamin out.</p><br/><p>The System had analyzed and told him before that, his capabilities were above those of the other mages, not because he was born with such outstanding talents, but it was due to his progressive method of meditation as well as a bit of luck. When the system of the runic law of meditation had been completely established, the world of the mages would enter a whole new realm, and his method would not be superior to the others.</p><br/><p>By then, even if the teachers of the academy defended him, he would be too embarrassed to continue holding the post of the director.</p><br/><p>The higher you climbed, the lonelier you would get.</p><br/><p>Finally, after some consideration, Benjamin decided to first try out the runes, one by one.</p><br/><p>As long as the sentence was not entirely drawn out, the destructiveness would not be as serious as what the System had described\u2026 Right?</p><br/><p>\"You are a problematic man,\" The System could not help but spat out, \"After numerous analysis of all cases of your behaviors, I discovered that you are always choosing the riskiest options, and test it on yourself. If the risk is great, and even the least bit of mistake would cause death, somewhere deep in your heart, you become very excited.\"</p><br/><p>\"...How am I excited?\"</p><br/><p>\"Whatever you say, but brainwaves and adrenaline do not lie.\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin had nothing to say.</p><br/><p>However, a complaint was just a complaint; the System\u2019s divided body of smiley faces retreated obediently, giving him space for his display.</p><br/><p>Every pair of eyes were watching Benjamin interestedly, as though hoping to see what he would be able to conjure up.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Benjamin took a deep breath and slowly stretched out his right arm.</p><br/><p>Using the water elements as his ink, he first drew out the first rune on the stone slate.</p><br/><p>\u2026Nothing happened.</p><br/><p>\"Since you want to die, then enjoy it properly. Doing it so slowly and cautiously is the stupidest way to do it,\" The System was like a spectator who wanted a more entertaining spectacle, shouting on the sides.</p><br/><p>Benjamin ignored its words, and carefully drew out the second rune.</p><br/><p>Ding!</p><br/><p>A soft sound, from somewhere unknown, rang out, and Benjamin was startled for a moment. The star chart above began to spin and turn, like celestial bodies, and beams of pale blue light shone down, appearing and disappearing.</p><br/><p>It was as though a switch had been pushed, the atmosphere in the space of consciousness had changed.</p><br/><p>\"What a situation\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin furrowed his eyebrows and looked up, only to see that the two runes he had drawn were now moving by themselves, like two fluttering butterflies, slowly flying to the top of his head.</p><br/><p>The runes encircled each other, spinning relentlessly. Slowly, a small dot of light was birthed between the two and it continuously drew stronger. Soon, it was a circle of light, the size of a human skull.</p><br/><p>Benjamin looked into the circle of light, but vaguely felt a sense of illusion.</p><br/><p>\"Is this\u2026 A door?\"</p><br/><p>After distinguishing it for a few moments, he spoke doubtfully, asking as such.</p><br/><p>\"I wouldn\u2019t call it a door. A\u2026 A hole would be a better description.\" The robotic voice came from afar, startling Benjamin.</p><br/><p>He turned his head, and only realized now that the System had run off about tens of meters, and was hiding here and there. A mild fear could be detected in its voice.</p><br/><p>What was it afraid of?</p><br/><p>However, it was right then that Benjamin\u2019s eyebrows moved slightly, and the skin on both sides of his face seemed to feel an undetectable movement of air.</p><br/><p>He was stunned.</p><br/><p>In the space of consciousness, there was supposedly no air, and under circumstances where no one had cast a spell, there should not even be a gentle breeze caressing his cheeks. Nevertheless, that flow of air moved and felt very real, causing him to feel as though he was in an illusion.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he lifted up his head and looked once more to the circle of light. What he did not expect was to discover that the water elements in the surroundings suddenly began to surge towards the inside of the circle of light!</p><br/><p>And, with the increasing strength of the \"wind power,\" the circle of light was very soon surrounded by a strong force of attraction. Benjamin, standing at the bottom, felt as though his feet were leaving the ground, and was almost sucked into the illusory circle of light.</p><br/><p>What the heck\u2026</p><br/><p>Benjamin quickly began to run a few steps away.</p><br/><p>\"What is this thing?\" He shouted as he hid.</p><br/><p>\"The two runes, for some reason, have pricked a small hole in the elemental plane,\" The System had run so far that it could not be seen, leaving on its voice to be heard in the distance, \"I advise you not to go too close, the hole is different from the elemental plane that you have entered before. Its form is too rough, if you dare go in, you will definitely be twisted into ashes!\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>\"How can this be?\"</p><br/><p>\"How should I know, you had better think of a way to cover it up, fast!\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin had no idea, and as he ran from the circle of light, he looked to the pyramid of runes.</p><br/><p>Up until then, that force of attraction did not seem to have affected his original runes.</p><br/><p>However, the circle of light did not seem inclined to disappear by itself; on the contrary, its force of attraction became stronger, and very soon it was like a black hole. No matter how far he was, Benjamin had the feeling that he was unable to stand steadily. The compound rune, floating in the sky and unmoving, also seemed to begin trembling.</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s heart pounded.</p><br/><p>He had no choice. He could only hold himself steady whilst looking back and draw up a few more runes with his hand.</p><br/><p>\"Elemental Order - Defense!\"</p><br/><p>The runes took shape, and the water elements before the light circle, previously unable to resist anything, finally began to look like something, at least\u2026 They could struggle for a bit before being swallowed in. And, under Benjamin\u2019s directions, a layer of invisible shield slowly surrounded the circle of light\u2014 the powerful force of control derived from the runes helped Benjamin to forcefully complete the enclosure around the circle of light.</p><br/><p>That frightening suction force seemed to have weakened a bit\u2026</p><br/><p>However, as Benjamin\u2019s eyebrows were knitted up deeply, the situation did not turn for the better.</p><br/><p>\"Ah ah ah ah ah\u2014!\"</p><br/><p>With a swoosh, a yellow thing flew past him, as fast as a bullet.</p><br/><p>Before Benjamin could take a better look, it had been sucked towards the circle of light.</p><br/><p>Immediately after that, bong!</p><br/><p>The figure crashed into the invisible shield and was locked in place, not disappearing into the terrifying circle of light.</p><br/><p>\"Save, save me\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Focusing his eyes, it was one of the smiley-faced bodies of the System. What was even more horrifying was that even though it had just been deflected by the invisible shield, but now it was completely unable to hide anywhere far from here. Right then, it was totally stuck on the shield, being sucked in still, and the spherical shape was being squished into the shape of a cookie.</p><br/><p>And, in the next second, swoosh\u2026 Like a series of lightning bolts, over ten figures flashed by him. In just the blink of an eye, all of the smiley faces had been sucked over.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was stunned.</p><br/><p>For some reason, the force of attraction of the circle of light on the System was especially strong. All of the smiley faces were stuck on the shield, completely unable to do anything but struggle. If the invisible shield were to disappear now, they would immediately vanish from Benjamin\u2019s sight. Even the process would not be seen!</p><br/><p>\"Hey! Are you okay?\" He could not help but stop in his track and yell out loud.</p><br/><p>\"Do I look okay? Quick! Think of a way to get rid of that thing!\" The System\u2019s voice had a fear that had never been heard before, screaming in a high pitched voice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

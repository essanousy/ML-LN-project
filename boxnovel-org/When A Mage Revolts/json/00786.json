The inside of the academy had been furnished with various check-in stations and the senior students helped act as guides. Because of this, although there were a lot of people this year, it still seemed more orderly than the year before.</p><br/><p>Everyone who walked in would pass the stone tablet, carved full of the names of victims. Visitors would put their hands together and bow slightly as they walked past it.</p><br/><p>\"...I did not think that you would have really carved it.\"</p><br/><p>In the messy crowds, the Guild Master stopped in his tracks before the stone tablet and turned around, speaking to Benjamin who was standing next to him.</p><br/><p>\"Should we have not?\" Benjamin shrugged and answered.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s not that. It\u2019s just that before this, no one has ever done such a thing.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded and smiled, \"Yes, there does not seem to be such a practice here... However, I think that it is very important to remember our heroes. No one wants to face death, but some have to bear the risk. If the students think about how their names might be carved on the stone tablet if they were to sacrifice themselves, perhaps, it will give them some courage to face the Church.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the Guild Master was somewhat mystified, \"Then, does the memorial service serve to polish up the new students?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin smiled slightly but did not reply, instead, turning around to leave.</p><br/><p>He could see that there was a lot of hope and naivety on the faces of the new students; they were clearly unsure of the future. And yet, at the same there, there was respect. Every time a returning student saw a familiar name on the stone tablet, the grief on their faces would also be coupled with a glow of determination in their eyes.</p><br/><p>Truth be told, since the establishment of the Academy of Magic, Benjamin had emphasized the threat that the Church posed to them, but most of the students had never been close to the Kingdom of Helius, so it was very difficult for them to actually understand just how much of a threat their opponents were. This time, however, having witnessed with their own eyes the sacrifices of their comrades in battle, Benjamin could tell that the students have undergone some drastic changes in their attitudes.</p><br/><p>It was not to say that their world had been turned upside down. Many of the students had always been very diligent since before this, but, this time, their slightly na\u00efve and carefree faces had started to turn more solemn, as though finally realizing the weight of burden on their shoulders.</p><br/><p>\"Becoming a mage is not as easy as attending classes every day and doing research on meditation and magic.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin had overheard a student say this in the academy, and at that time, felt mysteriously comforted. These kids were growing.</p><br/><p>Everyone needed to put in more effort, and even the problematic teachers, with Joanna acting as their representative, had slowly become more mature. Although their lessons were still not really acceptable, at least less of them were opening their mouths to complain and were all trying to focus on improving themselves first.</p><br/><p>Benjamin felt that they were giving birth to a very healthy culture in school.</p><br/><p>\"What a marvel, an academy built within a year has already far surpassed the achievements of the Academy of Silence, which has been operating in the mountains for years and years now.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a voice said from behind him. Benjamin turned around and realized that it was Elizabeth, as well as the two clumsy mages, the short one and the tall one.</p><br/><p>\"You have also come to visit the academy?\" Benjamin raised an eyebrow and asked with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\"Yes.\" Elizabeth nodded, smiling as she spoke, \"As a mage, I have to visit the Academy of Magic. I would be a laughing stock if people found out that I had not yet visited the institution.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shrugged, \"I did invite you guys to join the Academy of Magic right from the beginning.\"</p><br/><p>\"I know... But we owe you too many favors, how can we bring ourselves to trouble you again.\" Elizabeth shook her head and smiled, \"But, it doesn't matter. Now, our operations in Ferelden are going quite well. There is even a ready mercenary group. If you ever need any help, who knows, we might be able to assist you.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Benjamin nodded and bowed, signaling his appreciation.</p><br/><p>\"However... other to visit the Academy of Magic, I am also here today to give you something.\" Elizabeth wore a solemn expression and took out a letter, passing it into Benjamin's hands.</p><br/><p>Benjamin took the letter, feeling somewhat confused.</p><br/><p>\"What is this?\"</p><br/><p>\"A letter sent from my parents.\" Elizabeth lowered her voice, becoming suddenly mindful of her words, \"The actual situation is not to be spoken of in detail here. Basically, it's about the situation over there. You will understand once you've read the letter.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin furrowed his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\u2026...From the Wood family?</p><br/><p>He still remembered how, because of the internal unrests in the Kingdom of Helius, the influence of the nobles had been reshuffled again and again. The Wood family, which had always been low profile, had slowly become the kingdom's greatest noble family.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Benjamin put away the letter without batting an eyelid and nodded, showing that he had understood the situation. Elizabeth flashed him a smile and after some small talk, bid him goodbye to continue their visit of the academy.</p><br/><p>Benjamin wanted to find a good time to open up the letter, but today was the school opening ceremony as well as the memorial service; almost every visitor from the outside world had come to exchange a few words with him. Some of them held influential positions, so Benjamin had to accompany them on their rounds of the academy. As such, he was not able to find any good opportunities today.</p><br/><p>He could only act as though nothing had happened, keeping the letter with him as he continued his work regarding the school opening ceremony.</p><br/><p>Luckily, unlike last time, the school opening ceremony went without a hitch. After a morning of enrolling, the general assembly was held in the evening, and Benjamin did his usual routine of mobilizing the staff, before also giving some closing remarks on the battle that they had fought in the past.</p><br/><p>The new school term was announced to have officially begun and Benjamin soon returned to his room.</p><br/><p>Then, he slowly opened the letter.</p><br/><p>\"Honourable director, sir. Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule to read this letter. We do not know if you know of the situation in the Kingdom of Helius now. After the defeat at Icor and the attack by the cultists from beyond the seas, Havenwright is now in a somewhat precarious situation...\"</p><br/><p>The letter was not short. It took Benjamin no less than ten minutes to finish reading it.</p><br/><p>After he was done, he stroked his chin and fell deep into thought.</p><br/><p>The Wood family seemed to want to join forces with the Academy of Magic.</p><br/><p>This was not some new development. After all, their only daughter had become a mage and had been forced to escape from the country, so no doubt the Wood family would not be very loyal to the Church. Only, it was difficult for Benjamin to also think about the Fulner family, which had been destroyed.</p><br/><p>In the letter, the Wood family mentioned this. The king, being sick, had been put under house arrest by the Church, where absolutely no one was able to see him. As the Church was also controlling the Queen, they were free to run the government as they pleased, leaving the nobles in chaos. Right now, the internal clashes in Havenwright have become worse. The entire capital city was in jitters and every day there were nobles outside to St. Peter's Cathedral protesting, wanting to see the king at least once.</p><br/><p>They even suspected that the king had been killed by the Church, and the news about how he had been cursed by the cultists were only lies concocted by the Church.</p><br/><p>In reality, after the loss during the fight against Icor, the prestige of the Church had gone down. By now, the noble families had not seen the king for a few months, which they regarded as a very serious matter for the entire Kingdom of Helius.</p><br/><p>\u2014They had no choice. Even if the royalty were only the puppets of the Church, but they were still extremely important puppets. Just the word \"King\" was able to maintain control over all the cogs in the kingdom. In such an era, Benjamin was forced to acknowledge this.</p><br/><p>\"This is the opportunity of a lifetime. We don't know what the Church is going to do next, and whether the situation can be stabilized. But, if you wish to fan the flames, we could even shake the foundations of the Church to the core.\"</p><br/><p>\"They have recently prepared a small crusade to send out in order to take revenge on the cultists who attacked the capital. However, I have heard that His Highness the Pope will not be handling it personally. Because of this, the Academy of Magic can completely disrupt the movements of the Church and even... Send them a little gift.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They confirmed that they had finally gotten rid of the pursuers and were completely safe.</p><br/><p>\"We\u2019re here.\" The taller mage said softly, \"This is the rendezvous point that we\u2019ve agreed on with Elizabeth.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head helplessly and said, \"So... this whole plan was plotted by your Mage and Mercenary Group and Miles?\"</p><br/><p>He was actually not surprised that Elizabeth would be there. Those people were a group, if they were to come up with such a rescue plan, it would certainly involve many people.</p><br/><p>It was just that...it really did not cross his mind that those people would save him.</p><br/><p>How did they even get acquainted?</p><br/><p>This feeling was like...the people whom he initially thought were from two different worlds and would never get to know each other, has fused out of the blue.</p><br/><p>After disguising themselves, they entered the town and quickly met up at the rendezvous point. On the second floor of a ruined inn, Benjamin pushed the door open and saw Elizabeth and Miles waiting in the room. Miles was dazing out while leaning by the window, whereas Elizabeth was meditating as she sat on the chair.</p><br/><p>As soon as the three of them entered the room, they both immediately turned around and looked at them at the same time.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re so slow, I\u2019ve been waiting here for over four hours.\" Miles shrugged and complained casually.</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head.</p><br/><p>On their way there, they reduced the frequency of use of their magic as much as possible in order to avoid the Church - most of the time they relied on the carriage for transport, so of course, they would be slow.</p><br/><p>However, looking at how Miles had saved him from trouble, he did not say anything.</p><br/><p>\"When did you guys meet each other? Also, how did you know that I would be surrounded by the Church?\" Benjamin voiced out the doubts that he had been carrying all along.</p><br/><p>\"We\u2019ve...known each other since a long time ago.\" Elizabeth and Miles exchanged glances before she said, \"His father is a knight and has always served my family. We\u2019ve met many times since we were young.\"</p><br/><p>Miles added on, \"I\u2019ve told you before. You haven\u2019t forgotten, have you?\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>With that reminder, Benjamin suddenly remembered that when he previously encountered Miles at the graveyard, Miles had probably told him about it.</p><br/><p>\"Other than that, as for why we went to rescue you.\" Miles continued, \"When you were having a discussion with the leaders of a few other countries, I inadvertently overhead your plan. At that time, I could feel that something might go wrong, so I discussed this with the Lady.\"</p><br/><p>Elizabeth nodded and said, \"After we heard of it, a few of us smuggled ourselves into the Kingdom of Helius. In case the Church really had set a trap, we could help you get away from it \u2013 as we did.\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>By right, Benjamin should feel rather touched. However...Miles eavesdropped their exceedingly confidential military conference and even said it so pompously, which made him really speechless.</p><br/><p>Honestly, if Miles was willing to do it himself, Benjamin did not even need to rob the relief team, and he would not even be put in such a tight corner by the encirclement of the Church\u2019s big army.</p><br/><p>This group of people was really...</p><br/><p>Furthermore, by the looks of it, throughout the period that Miles was nowhere to be found, it was very likely that he was together with Elizabeth and the Mage and Mercenary Group.</p><br/><p>\"How did you guys manage to enter the Imperial Capital?\" In the end, Benjamin was too lazy to care about the details and turned around and asked.</p><br/><p>The security in the Kingdom of Helius had already been reinforced and become stricter, Elizabeth and the mages were even barred from leaving the place previously, so why were they suddenly able to come and go freely? Had they become so powerful?</p><br/><p>\"It was Master Wood who helped us sneak in through the blockade at the front gate.\" Miles explained, \"When the Lady went overseas, she put in some effort and finally managed to contact the Wood family. Moreover, the situation here was constantly in an upheaval; after a few of the greater nobles perished, the Wood family courted for the Church\u2019s trust and took advantage of the situation to loot many of the other families\u2019 estates, and eventually became one of the most powerful families in the Imperial Capital.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Benjamin showed a rather shocked expression.</p><br/><p>The Wood family...</p><br/><p>Honestly speaking, ever since the destruction of the Fulner family, Benjamin had thought that the influence and power of the nobles in the Imperial Capital had faded away. He did not think that the families that were usually extremely low profiled were secretly climbing their way to the top.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s nothing, my parents just managed to broaden their relations over at the Church.\" Elizabeth seemed to be a little embarrassed, she quickly changed the topic and said, \"However...there\u2019s a bit of a trouble. Now that the situation has developed into this, it will be significantly more difficult if we want to sneak out from the front gates again.\"</p><br/><p>\"Are we going to be trapped here?\" Instantly, the shorter mage looked very uneasy.</p><br/><p>\"Of course not.\" Benjamin laughed and said, \"You\u2019re all here to save me, so of course I\u2019ll have to get you out of here safe and sound.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019ve got an idea?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded.</p><br/><p>\"That would be great...\" Elizabeth nodded, but immediately after, she looked regretful, \"If that\u2019s the case though, then we\u2019ll be even again. I was going to use rescue operation of mine to get something from you.\"</p><br/><p>\"What do you want to exchange?\" Benjamin frowned.</p><br/><p>\"The Law of Runes and Meditation.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>He searched his backpack for a while before taking a booklet and tossing it to Elizabeth casually. Since the academy campus had not officially started their semester, the Law of Runes and Meditation was actually the secret of the Mage Academy and was extremely valuable for the mages outside.</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, for Benjamin, it was nothing more than a piece of scrap paper that could be easily printed out.</p><br/><p>\"Actually, you could have just sent a letter to the academy, there was no need for the trouble.\" He added on, \"This is really nothing much, we have everything piled up over there - I can even send you a whole box of them.\"</p><br/><p>\"Thank you so much.\" Elizabeth held the booklet and nodded thankfully.</p><br/><p>Benjamin scratched his head.</p><br/><p>He figured that with their friendship at that moment, he could actually invite Elizabeth and the others to join the Mage Academy. Followed by that, Miles would definitely join the academy as well, which would be of great help for them.</p><br/><p>The only thing was, Elizabeth seemed to be more inclined to do things on her own, which felt like she was not willing to owe Benjamin anything at all.</p><br/><p>And so, Benjamin dismissed the idea and changed the subject. After a short rest, they started their journey from the town, avoided the Church\u2019s search parties along the way, and left the borders of the Kingdom of Helius through the \"Skyfall Mountain\".</p><br/><p>As they experienced the spirits and the revenant world that was beneath the abyss, they were shocked and exclaimed to one another.</p><br/><p>\"They won\u2019t necessarily feed on my vitality, I\u2019d like to give it a try.\"</p><br/><p>Beneath the abyss, as Miles stood in a big box and looked at the spirits that were drifting everywhere, he stuck his head out and said suddenly.</p><br/><p>- The big box was held by the soundproof ice ball and was kept a certain distance away from everyone else. Only then could they be sure that Benjamin\u2019s magic would be able to hold Miles.</p><br/><p>\"No way.\" Benjamin declined without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Miles thought for a while then said, \"I think... I think the curse that was planted by the \u2018abyss trial\u2019 has something to do with this place. I should really go give it a try.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He checked it with the sensing technique and made sure there was nothing wrong before drinking it. Moreover, wasn\u2019t poisoning the wine a little too straightforward?</p><br/><p>Although he had doubts, but with Spencer so close to him, it wasn\u2019t convenient to ask the System directly and he did not intend to confront him directly. Therefore, he passed the wine back to Spencer.</p><br/><p>\"Forget it... Sir, you drink it. This kind of wine is not good for spiritual energies, and the director has banned us mages from drinking it. Although I would love to enjoy it, I am not allowed to.\"</p><br/><p>Spencer heard this and nodded: \"Is that so.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin saw him taking over the glass of wine, smiled at Benjamin and downed it without any hesitation. However, after drinking a glass full of wine, nothing weird happened, at most just a red flush on his cheeks.</p><br/><p>Benjamin saw this and smiled quietly.</p><br/><p>\"Can you tell me the way to the washroom? Sorry, I need to excuse myself.\"</p><br/><p>Spencer pointed at a direction, then Benjamin turned around and left. The moment he turned around, he had a helpless look on his face, and he questioned the System in his mind.</p><br/><p>\"...What is going on?\"</p><br/><p>\"The wine is really weird.\" The System said lazily, \"Of course, it is not the kind of poison you thought, but other than the ingredients that any other wines have, there is an extremely faint spiritual energy in it.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was confused, and asked: \"Can spiritual energy be put into drinks?\"</p><br/><p>\"It is impossible under normal circumstances, which is why I said that the wine is weird.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head helplessly.</p><br/><p>Anyhow, it was a good thing that the System warned him so that he did not drink the glass of strange wine. And now, he had no idea what was going on in this party, but one thing he can be sure of was the enemy he was facing knows of some tricks that he had never seen before.</p><br/><p>Potions? A curse? Or a new invention of the Church? However, there were indeed quite a number of weird things that exist in this world, so with that in mind, Benjamin had an empty feeling in his heart.</p><br/><p>What to do?</p><br/><p>After pondering over it, he felt like he needed to see the King. That high-ranked adviser constantly had a smiling face, so Benjamin could not find any clues on him.</p><br/><p>He went through the crowd, quietly left the main hall and went to the garden in the palace. The garden was also one of the venues of the banquet, dozens of dancers were jumping around the stage and were surrounded by a group of guys with perverted gazes.</p><br/><p>The King's was found in the first row.</p><br/><p>\"Your Majesty, you have finally regained the throne, indulging in pleasures like you did before will do you no good.\" Benjamin walked slowly toward the King and whispered.</p><br/><p>The King heard it, turned around and laughed loudly: \"What happened? Mister Messenger, since this is a banquet, of course, it is time to relax! Look at the lady over there... ...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin sighed helplessly.</p><br/><p>Despite what the System analyzed or using his own eyes, this man was indeed the King. However, he felt like the King was somewhat different from before, it was like he took the wrong medicine or he was high on drugs.</p><br/><p>...wait.</p><br/><p>Benjamin suddenly recalled the glass of wine that Spencer handed him just now.</p><br/><p>Although it was not poison, perhaps the spiritual energy in the wine would have some kind of impact on people, which would lead to drastic changes in their personality or magnifying their behavior. At least, this can explain the erratic behavior of the King.</p><br/><p>Therefore, since Spencer drank the wine without any hesitation, that guy must have been tricked.</p><br/><p>\"Mister Messenger, are you satisfied with the performance at the garden side?\"</p><br/><p>Just when Benjamin was wondering what to do next, all of a sudden, a voice came from behind and almost cause him to break out in cold sweat.</p><br/><p>He turned and saw Spencer who appeared behind him out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>\"You ...\" Just as Benjamin wanted to say something. However, he suddenly realized that the people around did not respond to Spencer's presence. Even the King, despite the close proximity, his gaze was focused on the dancer, and it was as though this high-ranked adviser was not here.</p><br/><p>It was as if... these people and the both of them were in two different worlds. That world was filled with colors, and the liveliness and noisiness continued. Whereas Benjamin and Spencer who appeared and disappeared mysteriously were both left in this place where the world became black and white.</p><br/><p>Strange.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Benjamin suddenly had an eerie feeling.</p><br/><p>\"Who are you? Did the Church send you?\" Therefore, he did not care and asked straightforwardly. And just as he expected, the King who was right beside him did not hear him.</p><br/><p>Only Spencer responded to him.</p><br/><p>\"Which church?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head and coldly: \"Stop acting stupid. You did something to the whole of Gealorre, do you think that I did not notice it?\"</p><br/><p>Spencer heard it, nodded thoughtfully, and said: \"Although you did not specify on which church, but based on my guess, you are talking about the Holy Church located at the west?\"</p><br/><p>\"If not?\"</p><br/><p>\"Okay, since you have found out about it, I will introduce myself again.\" He smiled and said, \"I\u2019m from a distant southern island, and I\u2019m a sacrifice offered to the Goddess. Mage Benjamin, I\u2019m glad to meet you.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was dumbfounded when he heard what Spencer said.</p><br/><p>...A southern island?</p><br/><p>He had never heard a place like this ever since he entered this world.</p><br/><p>He knew the terrain of this continent like the back of his hand \u2014\u2014 be it from any direction, when headed towards the south, there was just an endless ocean. There were tons of natural disasters in the ocean, and it was filled with magic beasts. Therefore, the people here rarely travel into the deep sea, so no one knew what was at the other side of it.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when a man claimed to be from the Southern Island, Benjamin could not help but be astonished.</p><br/><p>\"...You come from the sea?\"</p><br/><p>He took a few steps back, alerted and asked.</p><br/><p>\"You can say so.\" Spencer said with a smile, \"Mage Benjamin, you do not need to be surprised. Since hundreds of years ago, we have been moving towards the ground. The living condition of the sea was very bad, so we have no choice but to leave. In fact, if you have paid attention, we have already preached about our glorious goddess in several fishing villages close to the sea.\"</p><br/><p>However, his words did not lower Benjamin\u2019s guard, instead, he immediately activated the water element domain. Multiple ice crystals surrounded him and were ready to attack.</p><br/><p>\"Another guy trying to preach.\" Benjamin stared at him and said coldly, \"Get out of Carretas. The Church has caused enough damage here, and you have no rights to meddle in it.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

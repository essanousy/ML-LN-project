But, did you see the dumbfounded general when the Holy Light disappeared? He raised up his right hand to attack but had to put it down, it was so hilarious!\"</p><br/><p>In the hall, other officials had smiles on their faces too, and nodded their heads one after another. It was the first time the entire common hall was filled with such a harmonious atmosphere since the start of the war.</p><br/><p>Even the advocates who always tried to talk others down were all bowing unctuously at Benjamin as they now respected him.</p><br/><p>\"Mister Present, please forgive our discourtesy, the Runic Defense Technique is really such a shocking invention. The academy will go down in history for today\u2019s war campaign.\"</p><br/><p>As Benjamin was receiving the praise, he only smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>How could he put it\u2026 At the moment the artillery was fire, he felt uneasy as well, but when the Runic Defense Technique had successfully defended them from the round of terrifying salvos, he felt much more excited than the officials around him.</p><br/><p>However, he had to remain calm.</p><br/><p>\"We\u2019ve only blocked the first round of bombing from the Cannon of Holy Light, not repel the army of the Kingdom of Helius.\" Benjamin waited until everyone slowly calmed down from all the excitement before he said, \"It\u2019s not time to be happy yet.\"</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, the executive prime minister nodded as well.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s right. We must not let our guards down until we wipe them out from Icor entirely.\"</p><br/><p>With that, the atmosphere in the hall became serious, the topic turned from the reflection time just a moment ago into a strategy talk to discuss how to counter the enemy\u2019s attack. With such a big army facing them, the situation was not looking as positive as how they imagined it to be.</p><br/><p>Only this time, many people set their eyes on Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"Mister Director, what do you think we should do?\"</p><br/><p>Clearly, after the protection from the Runic Defense Technique, the officials started to become reliant on Benjamin and the Mage Academy. They acted as if they could just depend on Benjamin if they wanted to fight against the enemy.</p><br/><p>However...</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m not really an expert in leading soldiers to war.\" Benjamin shrugged and said, \"If the pope shows up, I can help to hold him back for a while, but to go against the army of the Kingdom of Helius, I can\u2019t be of any help anymore.\"</p><br/><p>He could not just lead the soldiers to a surprise attack against the enemy\u2019s army, now could he?</p><br/><p>Although there was no sign of Grant, Benjamin was clear that, as the pope, he would definitely be together with the army. Benjamin mustn\u2019t act rashly, else, he might even fall into the trap of his opponent.</p><br/><p>Since the war started, people like himself and Grant would usually be the nuclear weapon, the hidden trump card, which would deter the enemy from attacking. Any side that shows their card first would be at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>Because of this, it was very difficult for him to provide any better suggestions at a; it would be better to let the professionals use their knowledge and expertise to influence the battle.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing Benjamin\u2019s reply, the officials seemed to be slightly disappointed. Nonetheless, very quickly, they started to have a discussion regarding the strategy for the war, and at last decided to continue with their defense and to stay put and see what will happen.</p><br/><p>The army force of the enemy had always been stronger than theirs, the only advantage that they had was the topographical advantage of Rock City. Since the Runic Defense Technique was very stable and could not be destroyed, the priests are the ones who should be worried, not them.</p><br/><p>By dragging the war to an endless stalemate, it would actually be advantageous to them.</p><br/><p>With that, after a few hours of discussion, the meeting ended, the officials left hurriedly and started their own preparations. Benjamin, on the other hand, had already left the hall an hour earlier and started using his water elemental induction magic while he walked through the desolated streets of Rock City.</p><br/><p>It was evening and the atmosphere in the city was still filled with grim, nevertheless, he could sense the people who were hiding at their homes. But, he could also see that those people seemed to look slightly more confident.</p><br/><p>The Runic Defense Technique seemed to have elevated the belief of the whole city.</p><br/><p>As he scanned through the area, he arrived at the western city wall.</p><br/><p>\"Is the enemy encamped over there?\"</p><br/><p>As he viewed the campsite in the distance, he asked calmly.</p><br/><p>\"Ah... Mister Director, here\u2019s the thing.\" The patrol leader seemed to be nervous as he was talking to Benjamin, he stuttered as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\"After they stationed themselves there, has there been any movements?\" Benjamin did not bother and continued asking.</p><br/><p>\"That... So far there has been none, the enemy has not moved for three hours now.\"</p><br/><p>\"I see.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded and thought for a while.</p><br/><p>He was very curious about what the scenario in the army camp of the enemy was like at that time.</p><br/><p>After the Runic Defense Technique blocked off the artillery, the army of the Kingdom of Helius stood there embarrassed for quite some time. They turned away after that, pitched a camp, and seemed more determined than ever. However, Benjamin knew that the Church would not just waste their time away like that.</p><br/><p>What kind of unpredictable plan would they come up with this time?</p><br/><p>After all, it was the Church. As Benjamin thought about that possible scenarios, he felt uneasy.</p><br/><p>\"Hmm... Wait a minute, Mister Director, there seems to be some movement!\"</p><br/><p>While he was thinking, the patrol leader suddenly shouted loudly, briefly stunning him. It wasn\u2019t just Benjamin, the soldiers around started to look confused one as they turned towards the enemy\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\"They...with just some infantry, what can they do?\"</p><br/><p>They could see a few troops suddenly walk out of the military camp of the Kingdom of Helius. The probably numbered in the hundreds; from afar it really looked sparse, like a group of ants moving houses, which left the people in a confusion.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, they started moving towards Rock City. But, as the soldiers who were guarding were confused, they did not dare to take any extreme action.</p><br/><p>\"Mister Director, look...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin waved his hand and frowned as he said, \"Let\u2019s see what they\u2019re going to do first.\"</p><br/><p>A troop of hundreds of people would not be of any threat to them, but if it were messengers to negotiate, a few hundred of them would likewise seem to be too much instead. Therefore, he could not figure out what the group of people were here for.</p><br/><p>After around ten over minutes, the small troop of hundreds of people from the Kingdom of Helius arrived at the periphery of Rick City and formed an arc formation. They were about tens of meters away from the Runic Defense Technique, which allowed Benjamin to identify their equipment.</p><br/><p>- Most of them carried a bow and arrows.</p><br/><p>Amidst the confused looks, the few hundred troops notched arrows against the bow and started to shoot at Rock City. Without a doubt, these things would not hurt anyone at all; the arrows scattered around each corner of the Runic Defense Technique, which were then broken up into pieces by the elements that emerged from the barrier.</p><br/><p>However, Benjamin seemed to have realized something. His expression immediately changed.</p><br/><p>These people...they were doing research. They were trying to figure out the weaknesses of the Runic Defense Technique.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

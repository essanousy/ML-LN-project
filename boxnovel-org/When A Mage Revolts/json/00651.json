After the death of the Queen, no one could inherit her throne. Because of that, before she had died, the country had been put into the hands of the Guild Master of the Mage Guild and a few chancellors. After some discussion, they had decided to ask for the rulers of Ferelden and Carretas to come over to Regina.</p><br/><p>After the public announcement had spread throughout the country, in a short time, many discussions had arisen in Icor. The people expressed their grief over the death of the Queen. However, at the same time, the division of the three countries had not been more than ten years. A lot of people wondered, could this be an opportunity to rebuild the empire?</p><br/><p>However, no matter what, the resentment the people felt toward the Academy of Magic was still rising, and even the overall impression of the mages in the country had worsened. A lot of people felt that this was the conspiracy behind the mages: to have sabotaged and killed the Queen, control the governance, and bribe all the officials in the country.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the ideas of independence were sprouting up in various places all over Icor.</p><br/><p>After a few days, Ferelden and Carretas gave a response; the rulers of both countries had personally arrived at Regina to attend to their appointment. After the news had gone out, the fellows calling for independence finally calmed down.</p><br/><p>\"Is the empire\u2026 Really going to be rebuilt?\"</p><br/><p>Although the people of Icor loved the Queen, their hearts were still filled with nostalgia for the past empire.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in the great hall of the palace at Regina.</p><br/><p>\"What on earth is going on?\"</p><br/><p>The King looked at the Guild Master, asking with uncertainty. He had not found the slightest trace of Benjamin at all in the entire great hall, and he had barely left Regina for a few days before being called back halfway; he felt really confused in his heart.</p><br/><p>The Guild Master nodded at General Stuart, who was standing on the side.</p><br/><p>\"Due to the death of Her Majesty the Queen, there is no one in Icor who can inherit the throne. Because of that, after considering Her Majesty\u2019s will, we have deliberated and come up with a plan for these two countries to rule Icor together.\"</p><br/><p>The moment his words came out, both representative parties from Ferelden and Carretas were in an uproar.</p><br/><p>\u2026.Rule together? What did this mean?</p><br/><p>How could two countries govern another country together? Then, whose territory would Icor be? This was so unclear, why not just split the place into half, one for each of them!</p><br/><p>The King was feeling even more perplexed. Was this Benjamin\u2019s idea? Or was this another inside job?</p><br/><p>\"I know that all of you must be feeling very doubtful, but these three countries have all come from the same source anyway, and the division is only a problem that has been around for more than ten years,\" The Guild Master explained immediately, \"Because of that, I am suggesting here that each country signs an alliance agreement, to build the old empire federation. As for the jurisdiction of Icor, it will belong also to the federation. The both of you will send your people to govern Icor.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing such words, both representatives had furrowed their brows deeply.</p><br/><p>An alliance? Based on what?</p><br/><p>\"Ferelden has long been cut off from the Hudson Royal family, the warlords have taken over the entire nation. I refuse to form an alliance with them,\" The King immediately said.</p><br/><p>The Guild Master then spoke, \"If you refuse the alliance, then it will be seen as you giving up the right to ascend the throne in Icor, so all authority will be completely passed on into the hands of the ruler of Ferelden.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The King clenched his fists tightly, looking extremely angry.</p><br/><p>\"Your Majesty, remember the lessons the old king had taught you,\" The Guild Master looked at the King, speaking softly, \"Although the old king had been disappointed in you before, the division of the empire\u2026 That was something that even him, as a spirit, would not have wished to see. You forming an alliance and never fighting again will perhaps finally bring the peace to the old king\u2019s spirit.\"</p><br/><p>The King took a deep breath and became silent.</p><br/><p>Standing on the side, General Stuart, who had said nothing thus far, opened his mouth at this moment, \"The Kingdom of Helius is watching on the side like a tiger. I have no opinions concerning the alliance. Only\u2026 The so-called shared governance, exactly what sort of a governance is it?\"</p><br/><p>The Guild Master replied, \"Representatives from the two countries will take turns handling state affairs, and change every four years.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, everyone on the scene had on bemused expressions once again.</p><br/><p>This kind of regime\u2026 Was it really practical?</p><br/><p>\"If this fellow destroys the alliance pact during his period of governance, and uses all sorts of tricks to conquer Icor by force, what then?\" The King immediately asked, \"Furthermore, even if I were not worried that they do not break the alliance pact openly, they might still perform some small tricks in the dark; that would be enough to cause a great trouble for my country when it is time for us to take over.\"</p><br/><p>The Guild Master nodded, saying, \"We have considered this problem, of course. Because of that, while the two countries are taking turns handling the state affairs, we will need a supervisory mechanism that is independent of the countries.\"</p><br/><p>\"Supervisory mechanism?\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s right, a Judgement Parliament made up of the mages from each country. We will ensure that the number of mages from both Ferelden and Carretas will be equal. They will supervise every movement while the two countries are governing Icor, and if there is any sign of the alliance pact being broken, they will have the right to stop it.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the people there looked at each other, not knowing what to say.</p><br/><p>They had seen clearly what the purpose of this was. It was meant to be an official, proper way for the mages to come into the picture. Although, before, mages had always had an inseparable connection with governance, at least they had never been on the front stage. And now, they had evidently decided to use this chance to walk to the front stage.</p><br/><p>Judging from a certain perspective, this was basically dividing the dominion of Icor into three: One for Ferelden, one for Carretas, and one for the mages of the three countries. This regime made them feel extremely weird, but that the same time\u2026 They could not seem to pick out any flaws.</p><br/><p>\"The so-called Judgement Parliament, what sort of an organization is that?\" General Stuart suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\"The entire council would comprise of a hundred and fifty people. Every country would send fifty mages. You would send in your own representative mages.\" The Guild Master explained, \"And as for the mages that would represent Icor, we, the Mage Guild, will choose.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then wouldn\u2019t this be equal to the Mage Guild deciding the direction Icor takes?\"</p><br/><p>\"Of course it would not,\" The Guild Master shook his head, saying immediately, \"The judgment council would only have the power to supervise, and cannot be directly involved in the government. Every policy and decision would lie with the representatives of the two countries. As long as there are no actions that violate the pact, we would have no right to stop you.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, everyone became quiet once more.</p><br/><p>It seemed to be\u2026 A very reasonable regime, actually.</p><br/><p>Although, to them, having the two countries taking turns to be in power was something that was too out of the question. However, in such a situation where neither parties were willing to compromise, it was difficult to think of other solutions. Even if they were to divide Icor into two parts, how would the lines be drawn? It would still be a non-negotiable problem. If any party were to have a bit more of an advantage, the other party would make noise to no end.</p><br/><p>Forming an alliance with each other, four years for each country\u2026 It seemed to be the fairest option.</p><br/><p>The King was still rather unsatisfied.</p><br/><p>If he agreed to this, it would mean that he was acknowledging the regime of Ferelden, which had been usurped by outsiders and let a huge domain of the empire fall into the hands of people who were not part of the bloodline. He did not want to accept all this.</p><br/><p>This idea\u2026 Was it thought up by Benjamin?</p><br/><p>After thinking deeply for a long time, and asking more questions about the details of the alternating governance, finally, both General Stuart and he gave the answer, \"To be considered\". Subsequently, they turned around to leave the palace. Evidently, after returning, they would be discussing this matter properly with their chancellors.</p><br/><p>The Guild Master watched their backs as they left, shaking his head and giving a soft sigh.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

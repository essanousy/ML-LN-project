Have you finally come to a conclusion?\"</p><br/><p>\"I wouldn\u2019t exactly call it a conclusion, but his Spiritual Energy\u2026is quite similar to mine.\" The System hesitated for a moment before continuing, \"The way this guy constructs his Spiritual Energy seems to be a result of mimicking the elemental planes.\"</p><br/><p>Surprised, Benjamin said: \"The elemental planes? Are you talking about the mystical beings that exist in the Pure Blue World?\"</p><br/><p>The System\u2019s answer was a confirmation.</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s gaze at Spencer changed after hearing the System\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>He thought that places overseas would have a drastically different magical system with the mainland, but after the System\u2019s explanation, it seems that they\u2019re more connected that previously thought. Both sides drew their power from the elemental planes.</p><br/><p>How do the foreigners view these elemental planes?</p><br/><p>While that thought swirled around in his head, Benjamin\u2019s bloodlust temporarily fell. Isn\u2019t the Academy doing research on the special uses of Runes and Spiritual Energy right now? Spencer would be the perfect living specimen as his Spiritual Energy possessed a high research value.</p><br/><p>\"Then\u2026 what about his ability to disappear and reappear?\" asked Benjamin in his head.</p><br/><p>\"He could be using Spiritual Energy to blind your senses to a certain extent, even blinding me.\" The System continued with its explanation, \"He didn\u2019t actually disappear from his position, he had instead conjured an illusion to take his place while he walked over to his next appearance\u2019s position.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was stunned; no wonder he didn\u2019t disappear after being trapped by the sphere of wind.</p><br/><p>Now that Benjamin thought about it, Spencer didn\u2019t pose much of a threat to him anymore. Benjamin reduced the power within the sphere of wind, leaving just enough energy for his opponent to speak, but not enough energy to retaliate with an attack of his own.</p><br/><p>At that exact moment, Spencer opened his eyes. Upon sensing the reduction in pressure by the sphere of wind, his expression morphed into one of befuddlement.</p><br/><p>\"What are you doing, Sir Benjamin?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head and said, \"What did you mimic to achieve your form of Spiritual Energy?\"</p><br/><p>The shift in Spencer\u2019s expression was not missed by Benjamin. \"I do not need to answer your question.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then I also do not need to keep you alive,\" jeered Benjamin coldly. He aimed his pistol at Spencer, who was still stuck in the sphere of wind.</p><br/><p>Spencer only laughed dryly in response.</p><br/><p>\"Killing me will only bring you regret.\"</p><br/><p>The lack of fear in his opponent\u2019s tone came as a shock to Benjamin. Suddenly, Benjamin realized the problem he was facing \u2013 these people, who have honed their Spiritual Energy, are usually bothersome, and there was no guarantee that they would disappear completely after death too. Benjamin has seen his fair share of undead creatures, so would it be possible for Spencer to grow in strength after turning into a spirit?</p><br/><p>With that thought in mind, Benjamin holstered his pistol once more.</p><br/><p>\"I have no idea what your religion is exactly, but to you lot\u2026death isn\u2019t the end, is it?\" questioned Benjamin carefully.</p><br/><p>Spencer\u2019s slight shift in expression was more than enough an answer for Benjamin.</p><br/><p>He was right.</p><br/><p>Benjamin increased the power of the sphere of wind without hesitation. Spencer\u2019s expression morphed into one of fierce struggle. There was even a moment where it seemed like he would give up resistance any second so that he could let himself die within the water vapor.</p><br/><p>However, it was obvious to Spencer that the water vapor wouldn\u2019t actually kill him. Even if he were to dispel his Spiritual Energy Barrier, he would only be saved by Benjamin after being cut up by the sphere of wind, so there was no chance at all of him turning into a malicious spirit.</p><br/><p>\"You have plenty of time now, so start your analysis of his Spiritual Energy.\" Benjamin continued, \"I can change the wind pressure at will to influence the strength of the Spiritual Energy Barrier. Whatever statistics you want, I can provide.\"</p><br/><p>The System was silent for a moment, before sighing empathically, \"What a pitiful sight.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin only smiled. \"If you dilly-dally anymore, you\u2019ll be pitiful too.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026Yes sir.\"</p><br/><p>The System steadily began its analysis and research on Spencer. Benjamin, on the other hand, began circling Spencer, manipulating the wind pressure from high to low and vice versa. Spencer\u2019s expression from within the sphere of wind was one of confusion, his eyes wide. Every time he had the chance to speak, the sudden increase in wind pressure would just shut him up again.</p><br/><p>While the System was busy with its research, Benjamin was using his own ways to analyses Spencer\u2019s Spiritual Energy.</p><br/><p>After thinking about it, Benjamin drew an Affinity Rune facing Spencer.</p><br/><p>Once the rune took shape, as if experiencing a strong magnetic force, it was sucked into the sphere of wind with a whoosh. Benjamin\u2019s surprise was hard to hide as he could only look on while a giant rune appeared right above Spencer.</p><br/><p>In that moment, infinite elements surged towards the sphere of wind which caused the sphere of wind to lose control from within. It wasn\u2019t just the water elements, but the fire elements, earth elements\u2026had all condensed around Spencer, forming rays of light. The whole phenomenon was more shocking than a dozen people chanting a high level magic spell at the same time!</p><br/><p>What was happening?</p><br/><p>Even the System exclaimed in shock, \"What are you doing? Why can\u2019t you let me do my research in peace?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>He\u2026had only done the most simple of rune tests.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the sphere of wind completely lost control and exploded with a bang. Benjamin hastily summoned a large water bubble to lock Spencer in, as well as trapping the elements that were going wild and the blood and guts that were flying around.</p><br/><p>Nobody else present was hurt. Spencer however, had been blown to bits.</p><br/><p>\"Congratulations, you can finally see a ghost,\" scoffed the System.</p><br/><p>Its scathing remark was ignored by Benjamin, who was still nervously monitoring the changes in the large water bubble.</p><br/><p>A shadow suddenly appeared from Spencer\u2019s remains, bringing with it a mysterious wave of Spiritual Energy disturbance. At the appearance of the shadow, the entire imperial garden felt as it if had fallen into an icy cellar. Arctic flurry came rushing towards Benjamin, causing him to clench his fist reflexively.</p><br/><p>No way\u2026did he really pull it off?</p><br/><p>\"Hahahaha! Sir Benjamin, you have brought this upon yourself\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Spencer\u2019s voice seemed less grounded as it was emitted from the shadow. However, what Benjamin didn\u2019t expect was to hear Spencer\u2019s voice distorting like a machine.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t sound like somebody stopping what they were saying halfway. Instead, it sounded more like a tape that had suffered from a glitch while playing. His voice was suddenly accompanied by various noises before it gradually faded until only the noises were left.</p><br/><p>What is happening again?</p><br/><p>Benjamin immediately shifted his attention to the rune above the shadow\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Instead of disappearing after causing the sphere of wind and Spencer to explode, the rune was instead\u2026growing larger?</p><br/><p>\"The rune is absorbing his Spiritual Energy!\" exclaimed the System in horror.</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s eyes enlarged in shock as he watched the scene beyond his expectations happen before his eyes. Just as the System said, the shadow in the water bubble gradually turned transparent before their eyes, it was as if the spirit itself was starting to fall apart.</p><br/><p>Spencer\u2019s voice also turned into choppy shrieks.</p><br/><p>Benjamin couldn\u2019t help but ask, \"Why is this happening?\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026This is all your doing, why are you asking me?\" snapped the System.</p><br/><p>Within the span of less than a minute, the shadow had completely disappeared as it seemed that all of Spencer\u2019s Spiritual Energy had been absorbed into the rune. Not even a breath of energy was left. Benjamin was left stunned for a second before he used magic to scour every nook and cranny of the surrounding area, as if to make sure that Spencer had really disappeared and that he wasn\u2019t just hiding again.</p><br/><p>However, Benjamin was the only person in the garden, other than all the people that were unconscious on the ground.</p><br/><p>Benjamin looked upwards, gaze once again falling upon the Affinity Rune.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

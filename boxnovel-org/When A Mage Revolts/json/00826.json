The box was filled with bones and remains. He spoke with a cold expression upon his face, after a few moments of being at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>Before his table were Benjamin and the mages, looking helpless.</p><br/><p>Relying on the \"cover-up technique\" they had obtained through research at the last minute, they had successfully escaped from the netherworld and returned to the Academy of Magic. Of course, the various revenant materials collected throughout the journey had also been brought back and passed on to the old man.</p><br/><p>Only, the remains of the three most valuable intelligent revenants had been completely used up. Even the bone staff, the energy of which had been completely exhausted, had suddenly crumbled into a pile of dust. Because of that, they could only bring some 'precious' dust and ordinary remains of revenants back to the academy.</p><br/><p>It was obvious that the old man was not very satisfied with such results.</p><br/><p>\"Where are the remains of the liches? You have spent so much time to bring back this bit of rotten flesh and bones?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin gave a sigh, saying, \"We encountered a really huge hindrance during this round of exploration into the netherworld. We almost could not make it back ourselves, what more with these things.\"</p><br/><p>After that, they began to describe their encounter with the liches as well as the bone dragon, emphasizing the danger this trip had been fraught with. After listening to them, the dissatisfaction on the old man's face not only went away, but he had also become excited.</p><br/><p>\"A bone dragon as big as a castle\u2026 Have you gotten anything from its body?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin and the mages shook their heads like drum rattles.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, the old man was somewhat disappointed, saying, \"Whatever, then\u2026 Your experiences have at least confirmed some of my hypotheses. If my research is not wrong, the unknown energy of the netherworld and elements should be, in fact, one and the same thing.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Benjamin raised his eyebrow.</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean?\"</p><br/><p>\"Our concept, as we understand it, is that elements are indestructible and immortal. They sometimes dissociate into the air, are sometimes stored in magical beasts and plants, are sometimes magical phenomenon\u2026 They will only turn from one state into another, but will never be depleted. Otherwise, as time goes by, it would be that the number of elements in this world decrease.\"</p><br/><p>The male mage immediate spoke, \"But this time, we saw, with our own eyes, the elements being burnt by some greyish white fire.\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, but that is only what you see. Perhaps the elements did not completely disappear, but were changed into a state that we are unable to sense. As you've mentioned, after destroying the elements, the revenants had grown even stronger and greater.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the mages were stunned.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was not too surprised. After all, he knew that the elements were the projections of the organisms from the higher dimensions. Such arrogant, haughty things would definitely not be destroyed so easily. The netherworld might have been created through the influence of the elemental planes, only the method of influence was completely different from the one in the world of the living.</p><br/><p>As for the details\u2026 These were probably problems that they would never run out of for a lifetime.</p><br/><p>However, Benjamin had his attention on another matter.</p><br/><p>\"Since returning from the netherworld, Miles has not regained consciousness.\" His tone had become grave, as he spoke slowly, \"Do you know of any way we can save him?\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the old man had on a troubled expression, \"He\u2026 To be honest, people who have gone through the abyss trial have already been fated to have short lives. I am beginning to suspect that he has been immune to magic because he had, himself, turned into a physique that is half undead. Now that this physique has been stimulated, I do not see much hope for his condition.\"</p><br/><p>\"So there's no possibility of even trying?\"</p><br/><p>\"...I will try.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Benjamin fell silent, and gave a long sigh.</p><br/><p>While the old man and the mages were still discussing issues concerning the netherworld, Benjamin turned around and left them quietly. Miles had been placed in the empty dormitory of the academy, and he had gone for a visit prior to this. Miles had been unconscious for three days. The healing drizzle has been repelled by his force field, and the System had been unable to analyze anything.</p><br/><p>To save him now, the only thing he could rely on would be the progress of the academy's research\u2026</p><br/><p>Benjamin returned to the Director's office, feeling mentally weary. Too many unexpected incidents had happened during this trip into the netherworld. He really needed a good sleep.</p><br/><p>Collapsing upon the bed, he fell asleep the moment he covered himself. He continued to sleep until noon, the next day.</p><br/><p>\"Director, we have begun trial treatment for Miles. His condition so far is stable. Even if there is no way to wake him up, we will do our best to prolong his life.\"</p><br/><p>A mage came to report. Hearing that, Benjamin nodded and went to visit Miles. He had now been transferred to a top secret laboratory in the potions department, lying in the middle of a runic technique. The old man was carefully modulating some medicinal liquid, forcefully feeding it into his mouth every day, through a glass catheter.</p><br/><p>There was an aura of death, like that of a revenant, around Miles' body. No one could go near. However, Benjamin felt the aura of death being suppressed bit by bit, as the medicine took effect.</p><br/><p>This caused him to feel a bit more relieved.</p><br/><p>\"If there is anything lacking for the ingredients, please let me know. Even if I have to personally take action, I will get what is needed.\" He turned and spoke to the old man.</p><br/><p>\"No point.\" The old man said impatiently, \"The academy has professional procurement staff as well as a team of magical creature hunters. Why would we need you to do something like that?\"</p><br/><p>\"...Alright.\"</p><br/><p>\"You are still a director. Don't lurk around here doing nothing every day, bothering our work. Go go go, do what has to be done! I'm here to look after things.\"</p><br/><p>And so, Benjamin was chased out from the laboratory.</p><br/><p>He discovered that, as a director, he had been a little too capricious. In actual fact, during the few days he had been in the netherworld, there had been many visitors waiting to meet him in the academy. For example, just yesterday, when he had returned, Varys had, in a craze, grabbed him and forced him to make time, getting down to business properly.</p><br/><p>Helpless, he could only return to his director's office and begin to settle the daily matters of the academy.</p><br/><p>Two days later.</p><br/><p>\"These are the last few visitors, right?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin opened the name list, frowning as he perused it. There were a few merchants from Carretas, two mages who wished to join the academy\u2026 And the ever familiar face, Elizabeth.</p><br/><p>After some thought, Benjamin decided to meet with Elizabeth first.</p><br/><p>She had come for a visit today, and it was certainly concerning the Kingdom of Helius. Recently, the Church had been going about their business in a low profile, causing no trouble, but if the Wood family had discovered any tracks, they would definitely inform this daughter of theirs, who was living overseas, and contact the Academy of Magic.</p><br/><p>\"The leader, Elizabeth, has arrived approximately a few days ago, and has been waiting in Academy. I will inform her right away.\" Understanding Benjamin's wishes, Varys nodded and turned around to arrange a meeting.</p><br/><p>After half an hour, Elizabeth walked slowly into the Director's Office.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However\u2026 Benjamin was still slightly unable to deflect such an attack.</p><br/><p>Even the System spat on him, \"You are truly destined to be forever alone.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin could only shake his head helplessly and take refuge in the tavern next door, waiting for their plans to official begin. Duke Collin was also tactful to notice that Benjamin was not keen on the idea at all, and so he did not visit and trouble him anymore.</p><br/><p>During those few days, the lakeside town was as calm as it had always been. The streets were as quiet as the waters upon the lake, unable to raise a single wave. Finally, when the day of their plans arrived, Duke Collin did not appear, but sent the owner of the tavern over to deliver an entire set of Holy Knight armor.</p><br/><p>\"After half an hour, that troop of Holy Knights will be stopping by in town.\" The tavern owner said, \"The captain will come over and get you. All you have to do is to pretend to be a Holy Knight named Cree, and you will be able to follow them into Havenwright.\"</p><br/><p>Saying thus, he handed over the armor as well as a portrait of the Holy Knight to Benjamin.</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded and took the items. Preparations quickly began; there was only half an hour left, which was quite a rush considering he still had to put on his disguise. He must act fast.</p><br/><p>The tavern owner turned around and left after having passed the items over.</p><br/><p>\"Director sir, is it alright for us to just wait here?\" The young girl watched as Benjamin donned his armor while using herbs to dye his hair ginger red, and after some hesitation, she asked.</p><br/><p>Benjamin, however, answered while getting himself ready, \"No, after I leave with them, don't remain in this village for long. Think of a way to sneak into Havenwright. Find a family in the outskirts of the city and use psychic powers to hypnotize them, then leave a mark in front of their house. I will go and find you afterwards.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the young boy was startled for a moment, \"Director, sir\u2026 What are you planning to do?\"</p><br/><p>\"Nothing, don't think too much. Just do as I say, that's all.\" Benjamin gave them a smile, before saying, \"When you enter the city, don't forget to keep your Spirit Sparrows flying slightly further away, or you will be exposed.\"</p><br/><p>The two siblings looked somewhat doubtful. However, their trust in Benjamin had grown to an unconditional level. They nodded and did not ask any further questions, beginning to prepare themselves as well.</p><br/><p>Benjamin kept his smile away, as his eyes flashed with a hint of slyness.</p><br/><p>When they had entered the lakeside town, Benjamin had specially put disguises upon the two siblings. Thus, in actual fact, no one in this country had ever seen the real faces of the two siblings. Duke Collin truly thought that they were Benjamin's personal servants, here to serve him by bringing tea and pouring drinks, and so on.</p><br/><p>Because of that, no one would even imagine that these two children had psychic powers.</p><br/><p>It was not that Benjamin was manipulative. Only, sneaking into the Cathedral was such dangerous business that he just had to leave himself a bit of a way out. Furthermore, for some unknown reason, he still felt that\u2026 There was something wrong over on the nobles' side.</p><br/><p>Duke Collin might not have the slightest intention to harm him, but as for the other nobles\u2026 There were so many people involved, all of different classes and backgrounds. It would be hard to guarantee that there were no malicious individuals.</p><br/><p>Very soon, the half an hour was up. Benjamin was just about done with his Holy Knight disguise when there was a light knock on the door to his room in the tavern once more.</p><br/><p>\"...Holy Knight Cree, are you in there?\"</p><br/><p>A deep voice sounded out.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the two siblings rushed to hide in the wardrobe, and Benjamin, covered head-to-toe in armor, slowly strode over and opened the door of his tavern room.</p><br/><p>\"Yes, it's me, Captain.\" His face was covered by the helmet, so he did not have to worry about his disguise being too rough. He just had to take on the look of a Holy knight, answering in a low, muffled voice.</p><br/><p>The Holy Knight outside the door nodded.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go.\"</p><br/><p>He did not say much, and Benjamin did not ask any questions. Duke Collin had said that this captain had been bribed by the Wood family, but\u2026 Who would know, with a believer? Benjamin did not intend to chat with him as though he was one of them.</p><br/><p>In single file, they left the tavern quickly and merged into the troops in the main road of the village. Benjamin's horse had already been prepared by Duke Collin; from the saddle to the horseshoe, everything was specially made for the Church. With the Holy Knight armor, everything matched seamlessly. If one only looked at him from the outside, even Grant would definitely not be able to see any flaws.</p><br/><p>The Holy Knights did not stay in the village for long. After their horses were fed, they set off towards Havenwright. For some reason, the mood of the entire troop was especially quiet and solemn. Not a single person made small talk. Benjamin followed the troop from behind, and, naturally, felt somewhat grateful that he did not have to speak a word.</p><br/><p>After approximately two hours\u2026</p><br/><p>\"We've arrived.\"</p><br/><p>The System suddenly spoke, alerting Benjamin in his heart. Benjamin came to his senses and looked towards the front; right then, the great northern city gates of Havenwright were standing before everyone.</p><br/><p>He immediately activated the water elemental sensing technique.</p><br/><p>\"The trouble\u2026. Seems to have started? There is a lot of chaos in the city, and half the usual number of city guards.\" After some observation, Benjamin said thus in his heart.</p><br/><p>\"That's very good. It's all part of the plan.\" The System said casually, \"The people raising havoc in front of the cathedral are increasing. As Holy Knights, you will definitely be transferred back to the cathedral, and you will have the chance to get close to the King.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded and said nothing.</p><br/><p>At the moment, the Holy Knight troop he was in had already passed through the city gates. The Captain of the Holy Knight troop spoke a few words with the city guard, and right after that, his tone of voice changed; turning his head, he directed his orders in a loud voice towards the twenty plus Holy knights, including Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"Quickly! There is a massive riot going on at St. Peter's Cathedral! We need to get there and help!\"</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, everyone pulled at their reigns and charged into the already chaotic streets. It was then that Benjamin realized how much the security in Havenwright had worsened; in the past, it would be impossible to have Holy Knights on horses, racing on the roads, even in the outer districts.</p><br/><p>The civilians on the streets seemed to be accustomed to everything, dodging them proficiently. No one got hurt from getting trampled on.</p><br/><p>Ten minutes later.</p><br/><p>\"We want to see His Majesty! Where is His Majesty?\"</p><br/><p>\"The famine in the village has gone on long enough, why has no one helped us yet? Where is His Highness the Pope? We want to see His Majesty the Pope! What message has God passed down for us?\"</p><br/><p>\"...Quick! Get in! There are a lot of valuables inside!\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin arrived at the inner district of the city, quickly reaching St. Peter's Cathedral. There was a chaos at the entrance of the cathedral, making it look almost like a market. Beggars, farmers, merchants\u2026 People of all sorts were mixed into the crowd. Eight or nine out of ten of them were riff-raffs hired by the nobles specifically to come here. They were screaming and yelling a variety of things, in all kinds of languages.</p><br/><p>There were almost a few hundreds of them. However, none of them had successfully broken through into the cathedral.</p><br/><p>Because right at the entrance of the cathedral was the Holy Barrier, raised up to seal the entrance completely shut. No matter how noisy the rioters outside got, they could not rush into the cathedral. The priests could stand behind the barrier, prim and proper as they watched the noisy crowd outside coldly.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Benjamin could not help but frown.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026 How was he supposed to get in?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

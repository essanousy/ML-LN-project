It wasn\u2019t intense to say the least. Men from the Church were lined up nicely in a row, standing still outside the altar. All the priests flew in and chanting while holding onto a cross. A layer of transparent light film emerged and camouflaged all those from Church into it.</p><br/><p>Opposite of them, were a group of flamen dressed in long grey robes. There were about twenty of them, lined up on the high pedestal on the altar top.</p><br/><p>\"Naive dirty cult, are you aware of your sins?\" The eldest flamen raised both arms up high and shouted.</p><br/><p>Ravishing wolf, Silver hawk, Titanoboa... Decades of magic beasts trailed around the altar. Their foreheads had a strange symbol drawn with fresh blood. They seemed to be controlled by psychic powers as they gazed on the Church, with cold murderous intent.</p><br/><p>At the same time, bundles of Spiritual Energy mimicking vines, multiplying in endless succession spread from the flamens and struck towards the Church. However, the Spiritual Energy was blocked by the light film summoned by the priests. From the outside, it didn\u2019t seemed like anything happened.</p><br/><p>It was a nerve wrecking standoff that has yet to have fully blown. Beneath the altar were several corpses dressed in foreign attire. Most likely guards that were killed by the Church\u2019s first sneak attack.</p><br/><p>\"Evil worshippers of the sea witch, today marks your death.\" The bishop flew in front of the priests and naturally would not be suppressed, \"God has already bestowed us ways to conquer black magic. Open your eyes! Your black magic is no use against us!\"</p><br/><p>The older flamen threw him a scornful look, \"Humph... Do you really think the goddess\u2019 invincibility is only this much?\"</p><br/><p>Their Spiritual Energy amassed towards the direction of the magic beasts. Around the altar, decades of magic beasts roared together while the symbols on their foreheads became more radiant by the minute.</p><br/><p>Hiding far away in the forest was Benjamin who witnessed all this. He couldn\u2019t help but frown.</p><br/><p>So this was the secret technique on how the overseas worshippers were controlling the magic beasts?</p><br/><p>Seemed to be... quite voodoo witchcraft-ish.</p><br/><p>\"The casting full play is similar to that of the frenzy spell, but for some reason, I sense a trail of misleading spell and other complicated psychic energy...\" The young man was in a state of confusion as he mumbled, trying to wrap his head in deciphering this secret technique in controlling magic beasts.</p><br/><p>However it was soon when he and the young lady were feeling defeated. Whatever that was going on at the altar was far beyond their abilities. They could only give up.</p><br/><p>Benjamin wasn\u2019t counting on them to decipher this mystery.</p><br/><p>Vanquishing the overseas worshippers and obtaining all secret techniques related to psychic powers were his biggest objective for this journey. Although the two parties afar were still having their face off, but Benjamin felt that it wouldn\u2019t be long when they\u2019d officially start the fight.</p><br/><p>Those flamens should be demonstrating the psychic powers of controlling magic beasts as of now, then at the Church\u2019s end, what were they preparing?</p><br/><p>The priests were in midair, apart from maintaining the light film to cut off the psychic influence, there was a few of them who started chanting. Isolated rays of light fell from the clouds and shone concentrated on the bishop.</p><br/><p>Little by little, a phantom of a human being emerged in front of him.</p><br/><p>It was also then when the flamens were done with their preparation.</p><br/><p>\"Go. Submit to the life of the goddess. Use your sharp fangs to rip apart the sinners of the world!\"</p><br/><p>The older flamen shouted out loud. The magic beasts creeping around the altar howled and charged ahead like a bull out of a cage.</p><br/><p>Facing this, the bishop merely gently pushed, instructing the phantom to face these magic beasts.</p><br/><p>\"Messenger of Holy Light, cleanse this den of iniquity.\"</p><br/><p>The phantom of holy light went forward at the sound and from its sides appeared one rune after another. Soon, millions of grenades of holy light formed in the air and just like spilled over gravel, they were sprinkled over the charging herd of magic beasts.</p><br/><p>Benjamin raised his eye brow.</p><br/><p>He was merely a bishop yet capable of demonstrating such an attack this destructive?</p><br/><p>It was obvious that this was a work of runes. The sky canopy of grenade of holy light was enough to threaten Benjamin. If the bishop had used this technique during the encirclement of the giant octopuses, everything would have been wiped out in an instant.</p><br/><p>\"... It\u2019s the necklace around his neck.\" The System spoke at this moment, \"Have you noticed that that necklace is gleaming and glittering with a similar energy that of Grant\u2019s.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin had an eureka moment.</p><br/><p>The Church really has some of the quaintest tactics, the bishop was... borrowing Grant\u2019s powers?</p><br/><p>Here they were still in a cloud of confusion while at the altar, the collision between the grenades of holy light and beast herd had come to a conclusion. With a heart jerking yowl, the beast herd suffered great loss. Many of the magic beasts were hit directly with dozens of grenades in one go and never even had the chance to whimper before turning into ashes.</p><br/><p>These flamens couldn\u2019t look more upset.</p><br/><p>\"Damn it, you sinners of dirty light...\"</p><br/><p>However, the magic beasts under their psychic control knew no fear. The remaining magic beasts that were still in control continued charging ahead and were almost before the Church. However, the holy knights standing beneath the priests had already drew their swords in waiting. Without any hesitation, they charged and were in battle with the magic beasts.</p><br/><p>The light film that the priests summoned protected the holy knights so that psychic powers could not affect their minds that they may completely focus on the battle.</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the overseas worshippers would not be able to hold them off for long...</p><br/><p>The Church was better prepared that he had imagined. Not only did they had ways to restrain the psychic powers, they were even able to employ special powers. Benjamin believed that this divine art tool of borrowing Grant\u2019s powers could not be mass produced; or else they wouldn\u2019t be able to kill that many bishops during the invasion of Icor.</p><br/><p>\"Let\u2019s put a hold on the matters here. Bring me to your village.\" He turned and lowered his voice at the siblings.</p><br/><p>The sibling duo were stunned.</p><br/><p>\"But... We\u2019re really leaving things here?\"</p><br/><p>\"As you can see, the Church will not lose.\" Benjamin pressed on,\" I was thinking of taking the opportunity now while they\u2019re still in battle to collect all the books on psychic powers.\"</p><br/><p>The young lady hesitated before adding, \"But the elder has yet to appear.\"</p><br/><p>... Elder?</p><br/><p>Through this reminders, Benjamin started to recall, the siblings did mention many times about the supposed elder. The overseas worshippers has three elders, who were also the highest leader of the island. Each of them were accomplished in the art of psychic powers and were the source of maintaining the social class structure.</p><br/><p>They have not made an appearance?</p><br/><p>Realizing this, Benjamin started to feel something was amiss.</p><br/><p>There were a total of four larger settlements in this archipelago and were administered by the overseas worshippers. However, there was only one altar which was before them and it meant the world to this religion. The Church wanted to hit where it hurt the most so they chose to dock here and went straight on to attack the altar.</p><br/><p>And now the enemy was at their backyard and yet the elders were not in sight, how vulnerable could they be?</p><br/><p>Benjamin suddenly had a bad feeling about it.</p><br/><p>\"Quick, activate the intangible form!\" In short moment, he had a spine chilling tingle and quickly yelled at the System.</p><br/><p>The System could not fathom the reason why but obediently followed through. The second Benjamin entered into the intangible form from reality, there was a turn of events.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

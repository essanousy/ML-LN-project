The Magical Instruments Department were giving their all in constructing the Cannon of Holy Light, so they didn\u2019t need his help. And if that time he fought with Grant taught him anything, it was that Benjamin wasn\u2019t strong enough.</p><br/><p>To eradicate the Church completely, he would one day have to defeat Grant.</p><br/><p>As water elements condensed around him, Benjamin entered the Space of Consciousness. Around him, fused runes gleamed with blue light, slowly growing stronger. This was currently the only way Benjamin could use to make himself stronger, although the effects wouldn\u2019t be as obvious, but since he was already doing it, he could only rely on the gradual accumulation of power to help him.</p><br/><p>Once the accumulation had reached a certain limit, then only would he be able to cause a drastic change like before.</p><br/><p>And so, Benjamin spent the all his free time over the next few days on meditating. At the same time, Icor\u2019s border defense troops gradually came together properly. Almost ten thousand soldiers were stationed at the intersection of Icor\u2019s and the Kingdom of Helius\u2019 borders. More than thousands of mages as well as thirteen Cannons of Holy Light were dispatched as well.</p><br/><p>With a defense as strong as this, the leaders of the various kingdoms heaved sighs of relief.</p><br/><p>At the same time, although the Academy was in the midst of preparations for war, classes still ran as usual. Final examinations were around the corner and a majority of the students were busy with preparations for their examinations. Other than the students of the Magical Instruments Department, the rest of the students led their usual lives.</p><br/><p>Actually, the imminent war has been kept a secret. Be it in the town of Academy or the cities of the Three Kingdoms, the citizens had no idea about the upcoming war. This was the only way to avoid the Church finding out about the ins and outs of the battle formation.</p><br/><p>Days later, Benjamin received a Transmission from Miles.</p><br/><p>\"Quickly! Come to Regina!\"</p><br/><p>It was an extremely short message, but the alarm in Miles\u2019 tone caught Benjamin off guard. It seemed that Miles had sent the Transmission while running, as Benjamin could hear the faint sound of rapid footsteps.</p><br/><p>What had happened?</p><br/><p>Benjamin left his room hastily and asked Varys if there were any suspicious movements recently. However, Varys had said that all was as usual. The spies of the other kingdoms had reported nothing unusual as well, and had assured Varys not to worry.</p><br/><p>However\u2026the peacefulness only made Benjamin worry more.</p><br/><p>After considering his options, Benjamin ordered, \"Look for a few mages within the Academy who have nothing to do, and ask them to follow me to Regina.\"</p><br/><p>Although Varys was slightly confused at the sudden order, he nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Very soon, a team of around ten skilled mages was formed. As final examinations were around the corner, the Academy was bustling with activity and people without anything to do were hard to find. Because of Benjamin\u2019s persistence, a few militants who weren\u2019t eager on teaching also came along.</p><br/><p>Benjamin also summoned the siblings from the foreign cult.</p><br/><p>\"I have no idea what is going on, but I have a bad feeling about it.\" With a wave of his hand, Benjamin brought them up into the air and continued, \"Let\u2019s hope that I\u2019m just being paranoid. If nothing is happening, just think of it as a one-day trip to Regina.\"</p><br/><p>The mages shared looks between each other, some shrugging their shoulders.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s okay, we have already done battle preparations.\" Joanna lifted her robe slightly to reveal a row of potions tied around her waist and said, \"If nothing really happened, I would be pretty disappointed.\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t bullshit. You\u2019ve finally escaped the clutches of marking examination papers, you must be higher than the moon,\" taunted Lara.</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head in amusement. They were heading to an unknown situation, but he couldn\u2019t help the smile that tugged at his lips.</p><br/><p>Remembering Miles\u2019 tone in the Transmission, the mages gave it their all in speeding up their travel. The mages who were good at wind magic banded together to increase their speed, add that onto Benjamin\u2019s water vapor acceleration, the entire group of them were like a rocket speeding through the sky, reaching an unimaginable speed.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>\"That\u2026is that fire I see?\"</p><br/><p>As they flew closer, they saw the entire city painted in red not because of the setting sun, but because of the flames devouring the city.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was shocked.</p><br/><p>How could this be?</p><br/><p>With the mages in tow, Benjamin hastily flew overhead Regina. Looking below them, they could see the chaos dominating the city. The citizens were running amok in the streets while armored knights and soldiers swung their swords around crazily, murdering savagely. Blood flowed from the city gates to the city center.</p><br/><p>And among the murderous knights, some were in Icor\u2019s military uniform, while some\u2026where in the Kingdom of Helius\u2019 military uniform. The voices of the Church\u2019s priests could be heard as well.</p><br/><p>They were watching the chaotic scene of a collapsing city.</p><br/><p>The mages heaved a shuddering breath, stunned in their positions and at their wit\u2019s end. The foreign cult girl covered her gasp with her hand, shocked into speechlessness.</p><br/><p>Why\u2026why have they attacked Regina?</p><br/><p>\"Uh oh, it seems\u2026something terrible has happened.\" The System continued with a nonchalant tone, \"It seems that all the information you got these past few days were wrong, the Church is almost at our doorstep.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin gripped his fists tightly and heaved a deep sigh, regaining his bearings.</p><br/><p>\"To the palace!\"</p><br/><p>Without even a hint of hesitation, Benjamin waved his hand and flew the group of them in the direction of the palace. It was the political center of Icor, if the city gates had been breached, the palace was Regina\u2019s final line of defense as all the mages and government officials are gathered there.</p><br/><p>Most importantly, the President of the Mages\u2019 Guild and the ruler of Icor would be there as well.</p><br/><p>Benjamin had to find out what exactly was going on!</p><br/><p>However, as they neared the palace, they noticed that it was surprisingly quiet and peaceful. There was barely anybody in sight, but a few soldiers stood guard at the palace entrance. Although they were dressed in Icor\u2019s military uniform, but Benjamin saw the crosses branded on the armor.</p><br/><p>They were from the Church!</p><br/><p>Realizing this, Benjamin\u2019s felt his heart drop to his stomach.</p><br/><p>Regina\u2026had been seized?</p><br/><p>What was going on? Why is this so sudden? A few days back, the Church was still pulling back its troops, and the foreign cult had caused them a lot of trouble too. But now\u2026Icor has fallen under the firing of cannons.</p><br/><p>What about the soldiers stationed at the borders? The Cannons of Holy Light that the Academy sold to them?</p><br/><p>A chill ran down Benjamin\u2019s spine.</p><br/><p>But\u2026wait, something isn\u2019t right!</p><br/><p>He suddenly realized that something was odd.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

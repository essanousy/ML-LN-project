Grant\u2019s figure was seen again, he held a cross tightly in his hand and did not look good.</p><br/><p>A second later, the cross automatically crumbled into powder which dissipated in the wind. The light ray that shone down from the clouds disappeared right after, by the looks of it, he too paid a heavy price to attack Joanna.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was not going to let him have any breaks.</p><br/><p>As soon as the elemental storm was formed, he controlled the magic that was out of control and slowly pushed it towards Grant\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\"This move again.\"</p><br/><p>Grant let out a \"humph\", clearly the storm was not new to him. In the beginning, he wanted to rely on teleportation to dodge the attack, but the other mages around kept on attacking him and harassed him with the simplest and quickest magic, so they managed to hold him on the spot in just a short time.</p><br/><p>Therefore, it would be very difficult for him to escape from the plane of attack of the elemental storm.</p><br/><p>When Grant realized that, he unfolded his palms and gathered golden flames from the center of his palms.</p><br/><p>As the flames danced around, it somehow let out a sense of holiness. Grant did all he could to transfer all the Holy Light gathered into the flames, the flames did not become greater than it was, but a mysterious circle of light was vaguely formed around it.</p><br/><p>\"He... Is he trying to go head-on with the elemental storm?\"</p><br/><p>Upon seeing that, Benjamin could not help but frown too.</p><br/><p>Although the power of the trick was not always stable, but there was no limit to the runes. Grant could actually use the magical tools for teleport to continue dodging, but it seemed like he was going to forcefully disperse the elemental storm.</p><br/><p>It was a great opportunity.</p><br/><p>Benjamin quietly took out the remaining ten over water element crystals from his bag, and threw them into the elemental storm discretely as he hid in Grant\u2019s blind spot. Instantly, an explosion was heard from within the elemental storm, concentrated water magic started dancing and splashing around from the inside, the other mages were all scared by it.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Grant slowly threw out golden flames from his hands.</p><br/><p>Like a duckweed in the endless sea, the flames drifted casually and drew out a smooth shape of a tiger in the sky. A second later, it flew into the elemental storm gently.</p><br/><p>A muffled poof was head.</p><br/><p>The flames immediately drowned in the endless magic, nonetheless, there was some disorder inside of the elemental storm. Magic that was out of control started shooting outwards, ice blades, water arrows... Benjamin realized that the elemental storm did not show any sign of it being attacked, but it was becoming stronger at the speed of light.</p><br/><p>Other mages had to back off far away, held up their shields, and protected themselves from the incontrollable magic that went haywire.</p><br/><p>\"This...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was rather shocked.</p><br/><p>He did not think that Grant was not planning to go head-on with the elemental storm - He must had researched some sort of method during his own time, he could actually make the elemental storm go out of control, from the inside.</p><br/><p>With the help of the runes in his hands, Benjamin could still manage the storm and control it, but he realized that the speed of movement of the storm was greatly reduced.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it seemed like no one could actually hold down Grant\u2019s actions anymore...</p><br/><p>As Benjamin thought so, he immediately looked towards Grant. At the same time, Grant still stopped in the air and looked at Benjamin from a faraway distance.</p><br/><p>It was then that Benjamin somehow saw something from the looks in his eye...dissatisfaction?</p><br/><p>Benjamin was still in doubt, but in the next second, Grant turned around suddenly, the light wings behind him flapped and he flew towards the outskirts of the city. As he flew, he took out a horn and blew it loudly, the sharp sound rang throughout the whole of Regina.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the ten mages who were present were all shocked.</p><br/><p>That was...</p><br/><p>\"Wait a minute, he\u2019s running away!\"</p><br/><p>Miles was the first to react, he took the first step and chased after Grant.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Grant\u2019s position kept on rising and it finally reached an unreachable height for Miles. Therefore, he could only give up pursuing him.</p><br/><p>As for Benjamin, he hesitated for a while but decided not to pursue him. He removed the runes, disbanded the elemental storm, turned around, and then flew towards the city gate.</p><br/><p>\"Mister Director...\" A few mages looked at him in confusion.</p><br/><p>\"There\u2019s no point chasing after him, that fellow must have kept some backup tricks, we\u2019ll only end up suffering losses if we chase after him recklessly.\" Benjamin waved and urged on, \"You heard the horn? The army of the Kingdom of Helius must have begun to retreat, lets hurry over to help.\"</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, he was still quite surprised.</p><br/><p>Grant escaped...</p><br/><p>An arrogant and genius pope would actually choose to retreat under the siege of ten over mages. In reality, the chemistry that was trained in a few days\u2019 time for the \"Light Slayer\" was almost used up, the elemental storm became out of control, if they continued fighting, victory or defeat would still be uncertain.</p><br/><p>Was it possible that...Grant thought that Benjamin left some room for maneuver?</p><br/><p>\"They certainly don\u2019t know about your body condition now.\" The System said firmly, \"So far, the Church doesn\u2019t even know about the sustain time and cooling of the \u2018Descent of Water\u2019, they definitely don\u2019t know that your spiritual energy has not recovered and thought that you\u2019ll be able to use it anytime!\"</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that, Benjamin thought for a while and thought that it was very possible.</p><br/><p>Previously in the wheel-like protracted war, he was always drifting around the borders of the war zone in order to oversee the entire situation, but it seemed to Grant that he was handling a butcher\u2019s cleaver with ease. Grant definitely knew that Benjamin had two types of battle mode, the war at Norman Valley left a deep impression on him.</p><br/><p>Thus...he was probably afraid that Benjamin could really kill him, so he ran away.</p><br/><p>As Benjamin thought so, he could not help but shake his head.</p><br/><p>Although it was not so uncomfortable anymore, but each time he cast magic, his mind would hurt for a bit. From his way of doing things, if he could have used the \"Descent of Water\", he would have used it from the beginning, why wait?</p><br/><p>However, since Grant chose to retreat, their task for the day was perfectly completed.</p><br/><p>Within a few minutes\u2019 time, Benjamin flew and arrived near the city gates. Both armies that battles in the war ended up in an overpowering situation. The Kingdom of Helius lost their momentum, the priests were fleeing with all their might, the soldiers scattered as soon as Icor\u2019s army attacked, they escaped in all directions and no longer had the power to resist.</p><br/><p>Only that...the entire war zone looked extremely tragic. The land was filled with disaster victims, there was so much blood that it flowed like a river, and mountains of corpses blocked the path to the streets.</p><br/><p>Benjamin calculated for a while. Although the Kingdom of Helius suffered a terrible loss, but the dead and wounded in Icor was not much lesser than theirs.</p><br/><p>He could not help but felt rather down.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s wrong? What\u2019s the situation now? Where\u2019s that pope?\" When the president saw Benjamin at the war zone, he flew over quickly and asked.</p><br/><p>\"He ran away after being beaten by us.\" Benjamin regained his composure and answered.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that, the president sighed contently and looked like a great weight was lifted off from him. He took a glance around the war zone that looked like a horrible mess, then looked towards the devastated streets of Regina. The brutal images did not make him look unhappy at all, instead, his eyes shone with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>He nodded.</p><br/><p>\"We...finally took back Regina!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Why was it never mentioned in any of the information given before?\"</p><br/><p>As the general hurriedly walked into the tent, he took off his helmet and slammed the desk. Then, he threw this question right into the faces of all the priests present. The priests cast their eyes down and remained silent and the atmosphere became awkward all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>The general looked even more dissatisfied because of this.</p><br/><p>\"Do you plan to explain this? A complete compilation of information..... who was the one who said this? Why aren\u2019t you saying anything now?\"</p><br/><p>At last, a priest coughed and said slowly, \"General Press, actually, we\u2019ve already mentioned the Runic Defense Technique during the very first briefing - you probably missed it.\"</p><br/><p>\"Missed it?\" The general laughed sarcastically, \"If it was mentioned in the information that \u2018The Runic Defense Technique can block off the bombardment from tens of Cannon of Holy Light at the same time\u2019, instead of just a brief mention about it, I\u2019m sure no one would have missed it, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"This isn\u2019t something that we can look into anyway.\" The priest tried hard to remain a calm look and said slowly, \"The Runic Defense Technique has only ever been seen once, which is when the Mage Academy used it to defend against the attack from Icor. Other than that, this technique has always been kept under wraps. We tried our best to investigate it.\"</p><br/><p>\"If that\u2019s the case, then you shouldn\u2019t have boasted about it from the start.\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>As the general looked at the priests who had fallen silent again, he could not help but slam the desk again and shook his head.</p><br/><p>Their original plan was to utilize a round of Holy light artillery fire to directly decimate the defense of Rock City, then their soldiers would be able to charge in to reap the disoriented enemies with ease. However, due to the Runic Defense Technique, their plan to attack was declared a complete failure right from the off.</p><br/><p>As General Press recalled the situation, an intense feeling of shame and resentment arose in his heart.</p><br/><p>When sixty-five of the Cannot of Holy Light were fired at the same time, General Press had even raised his right hand and gotten ready to give the order to charge. But soon after, an invisible barrier surfaced at Rock City, which left him no choice but to put down his hand once again.</p><br/><p>Gigantic explosions went off one after another, the bright Holy Light spread out like tsunami while they could see that the air around Rock City had become sort of distorted. The invisible barrier constantly tremored due to the attacks, but it did not seem like it would falter anytime soon.</p><br/><p>Concentrated magic emerged from within the barrier and blocked the Holy Light, which weirdly dispelled the power of the artillery bit by bit. There were many moments when General Press thought that the barrier was going to be destroyed, but it was immediately fixed again by those surging elements.</p><br/><p>Over a short period of just ten seconds, his mood went back and forth a countless number of times.</p><br/><p>Why did nobody ever mention the \"Runic Defense Technique\" to him when he was laying down the plan of attack?</p><br/><p>The priests only cared about lavishly praising how powerful the Church was and how sublime the providence was, but each time the research result of the Mage Academy was mentioned, they always talked in a disdain manner. \"Insignificant skills used by mages to fool the people\" - The exact words from a priest.</p><br/><p>If those idiots could pay more attention to it from the very beginning, their attack plan would not end up being such an embarrassment.</p><br/><p>General Press became even angrier as he thought about it.</p><br/><p>\"At least say something, you idiots! Are you mute? What trick is this Runic Defense Technique, say something!\" More banging sounds from the desk, which was in sharp contrast to the priests beside him who were frigid like corpses.</p><br/><p>\"... General, it\u2019s not the time for condemnation, just put this aside for now.\"</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a voice was heard from behind him, which cut off the aggrieved general. Instantly, the priests who had their heads down, all stood up and bowed respectfully as though suddenly granted a pardon.</p><br/><p>\"Your Highness the Pope.\"</p><br/><p>The general turned around quickly, he had no choice but to hold back his fury and lower his head to greet the pope as well.</p><br/><p>Grant nodded and walked in from the entrance of the tent. He walked over to the long conference desk then took a seat and the end of it. He glanced at the people who were present and remained silent for some time before finally speaking.</p><br/><p>\"We\u2019ll look into the issue of that missing information in the future, for now, we\u2019ll completely scrap the original attack plan. General Press, tell me, how can we bring Rock City down?\"</p><br/><p>\"This...we know too little from the information regarding the Runic Defense Technique. However, I suggest that we make some slight adjustments and unfold another round of strikes \u2013 this time with the Cannon of Holy Light and the soldiers attacking together. This way, the barrier of Rock City won\u2019t be able to hold against us no matter how strong it is.\"</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Grant nodded then asked, \"You still don\u2019t need my help?\"</p><br/><p>\"Your Highness can just sit and watch as we fight this war.\" The general said carefully, \"When that devil from the Mage Academy returns to counter-attack, Your Highness can show up then and strike back mercilessly.\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmm...that sounds good.\"</p><br/><p>Grant deliberated for a moment then gave his approval.</p><br/><p>The general sighed in relief.</p><br/><p>Even though the pope was not even half his age, but Press was clear that the inscrutable young man must be a terrifying being. Inconsistent emotions, moody... General Press still remembered the reason why the pope could become the commander in chief of the attack was that the previous two generals had been \"handled\" as they had tried to oppose him.</p><br/><p>In spite of the Church\u2019s aloof status, there was never once a pope who would act in such manners. Although he was just sitting at the same desk with the pope as they discussed matters, the general felt anxious and uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>The anger that he had previously had disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>\"If that\u2019s the case, then you should come up with a plan quickly. General Press, you\u2019ve led soldiers and fought in many battles for years, I hope that you won\u2019t disappoint me.\"</p><br/><p>At last, Grant left him these parting words before leaving the tent. The general nodded at the message and watched as the Church left. Soon after, he pulled the curtains of the tent close without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Finally gone...</p><br/><p>He shivered for a while, then shook his shoulders to get rid of the jitters. Then, he looked at the priests in the tent again with a cold look.</p><br/><p>\"I want information on the Runic Defense Technique.\" He put his hands on the desk, and said slowly, \"How does it happen? What does it rely on to be maintained? What weaknesses does it have... Even the smallest bit of information that you might consider not worth mentioning, you will die trying to get for me, understood?\"</p><br/><p>The priests remained silent but nodded their heads.</p><br/><p>\"Good.\"</p><br/><p>The general did not look completely satisfied but eventually stormed out of the tent.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

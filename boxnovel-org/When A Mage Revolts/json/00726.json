Only a few thousand meters left... It was, at most, a week\u2019s journey. He was afraid that the Church would not wait and might start a war within the month. They did not want to mess about in the shadows anymore and wanted to fight them head-on before the academy had reached full maturity.</p><br/><p>For Benjamin and the rest, this was not good news.</p><br/><p>\"...How many Cannons of Holy Light can you produce in a month?\" Hearing this, the Guild Master could not help but take a deep breath and ask.</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head, answering, \"Five, at most.\"</p><br/><p>The timing was too tight; not just regarding the Cannon of Holy Light, but also regarding the speed that they had set up their secret army.</p><br/><p>Also, once the war starts, the business of the academy would be affected, and their income would fluctuate. Benjamin might be able to earn a sum of profit from the war by selling firearms, but to them, stability was more important.</p><br/><p>They could not let the Church send out their troops so soon!</p><br/><p>\"How much do you know concerning the relocation of supplies in the Kingdom of Helius? Do you have their exact route?\" Benjamin seemed to have suddenly made a decision and spoke, \"If we really want to start a war with the Church, we need more time to prepare.\"</p><br/><p>The General was slightly startled and said, \"You plan to...\"</p><br/><p>\"I will destroy their rations.\" Benjamin said resolutely, \"I know that destroying a batch of supplies will not affect the big picture much, but by doing so, we can buy ourselves up to a week\u2019s time.\"</p><br/><p>If he were to cause trouble in the Kingdom of Helius, the Church\u2019s plan would definitely be delayed.</p><br/><p>But, the other people had astonished expressions upon hearing Benjamin\u2019s idea.</p><br/><p>\"To do this... Isn\u2019t this too dangerous?\"</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not the first time I\u2019ve done it.\" Benjamin smiled and said, \"I\u2019ve even managed to obtain the blueprint of the Cannon of Holy Light, so don\u2019t you guys worry about my safety.\"</p><br/><p>\"But you are the leader of the Academy of Magic, and the hope of all mages.\" The Guild Master advised, \"If you were to die, our situation would worsen to an unimaginable state.\"</p><br/><p>\"I will not die.\" Benjamin shook his head, \"You do not need to advise me. This trip must be made. Or, do you have a better plan to delay their troops?\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the few people looked at each other, seemingly still doubtful about this plan. This was very understandable, as they did not understand what Benjamin had done before, and even more so that Benjamin had long been used to executing such risky and dangerous plans. With their typical train of thought as superiors, they would not be able to understand Benjamin.</p><br/><p>As long as Benjamin had weighed the risk and determined it was fine, then it was alright.</p><br/><p>Since he possessed such astounding capabilities, he should not remain an ordinary leader, forever sitting at the back, planning strategies. They would only have a chance to succeed if they mobilized and used all available resources.</p><br/><p>And Benjamin\u2019s extraordinary powers was one of their strongest cards.</p><br/><p>\"Please, director, execute utmost precaution. Do not force yourself.\"</p><br/><p>Finally, after some words of advice, these people silently acknowledged Benjamin\u2019s plan and even looked at him with the sort of gaze that one would use on a hero, as though he was going to die a martyr\u2019s death. General Stuart gave all the information he had gotten from his investigations to Benjamin and had even revealed the names of a few secret spies so that Benjamin could contact them when he entered the Kingdom of Helius to get some help.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was quite overwhelmed with the attention.</p><br/><p>He was only taking a trip to the Kingdom of Helius, killing a bunch of people and burning a bunch of rations before escape the Church\u2019s pursuit once more. Did they need to act like it was such a shocking thing?</p><br/><p>After the firearms conference had ended, he arranged some matters concerning the academy, then immediately took off, not wishing to be delayed in the slightest. Those people still wanted to send him some helpers and things like that, but he instantly declined them, expressing that he did not want the extra baggage.</p><br/><p>However, this time, entry into the Kingdom of Helius would definitely be a bit more troublesome.</p><br/><p>The range of mountains on the borders of the country would be filled with lookouts by now; Benjamin did not wish to alert them to his plan, so he could only take a detour around the Spirit Abyss. Because time was of the essence, he kept flying without stopping for sleep; within a day, he had reached the Kingdom of Helius.</p><br/><p>After that, he first contacted General Stuart\u2019s spy.</p><br/><p>\"Where are the rations now? Have you checked on their location?\"</p><br/><p>In the house of the mayor of a small town, Benjamin rubbed his temples and asked.</p><br/><p>He had not imagined that the General\u2019s men were so great, that one of them had even become a mayor. No wonder they could get such information. And to think, the men in the spy department of the academy dared to only mingle in remote inns for sub-prime information.</p><br/><p>\"Honorable mage, the rations troop had passed through our town six days ago; they are now heading northeast.\" The mayor hurriedly opened up the map and said respectfully, \"I have taken extra precautions and stationed some of our men on the various routes, to see where the rations troop go. Some of them have not discovered anything, some of them... were immediately caught and killed.\"</p><br/><p>Saying this, the mayor stopped for a while before continuing, \"However, their corpses point out a clear route for us.\"</p><br/><p>Using a red inked pen, he drew out a long and thin line on the map.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Benjamin could not help but be in awe.</p><br/><p>\"Is this the line of advancement for the rations troops?\" He took a deep breath and asked, \"Can you make an estimation of where they are now?\"</p><br/><p>\"They should be near the Norman Valley, and they will reach the Town of Crewe very soon.\" The mayor answered. \"Honorable mage, please make sure to move fast.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded, \"Of course.\"</p><br/><p>If he had more time, he might still try to understand the situation a bit more here, but time waited for no man. The Town of Crewe was already a military town; once the rations arrived there, whatever Benjamin planned to do, he would have to do so only after facing quite a few Cannons of Holy Light all trying to take his life.</p><br/><p>Right now, the Church still did not know that Benjamin had entered the Kingdom of Helius. He had to use this opportunity to stop this ration troop once and for all.</p><br/><p>Bidding the mayor farewell, Benjamin set out once again. Under the pitch black sky, his figure was hidden in the midst of water vapor, flying speedily forward and choosing the most remote and desolate route. It was in this way that he ensured that no one could detect him.</p><br/><p>\"Do you think... That the Church is clueless about you coming after them?\" The System suddenly sounded asked.</p><br/><p>\"As long as no one has leaked anything, then there is no way they could know,\" Benjamin answered in his heart. \"I have sealed up the key in an anti-magic bubble. The Church is unable to use sensing techniques capable of breaking past those shields.\"</p><br/><p>\"Suit yourself... But, I\u2019m only saying what I instinctively feel.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head, and did not bother about the System anymore; he hurried on even more quickly towards his destination.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

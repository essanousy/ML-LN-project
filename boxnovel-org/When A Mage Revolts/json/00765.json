The troops that had just been attacking the city had already retreated and were silently waiting for the moment of destruction for Rock City.</p><br/><p>The time left for Benjamin was not much.</p><br/><p>He was very clear about this, and so, in the state of \"Descending of Water\", his spiritual energy was continually depleting, without a sparing thought. Every water element that he could touch was activated by him, turning them into flows of water that condensed into the two gigantic rivers spanning across the skies.</p><br/><p>Benjamin felt a burden that he had never had before.</p><br/><p>The amount of water this time was far greater than the humongous water ball at Havenwright; not to mention the rolling waves in the rivers, lively and never-ending, forming a world of their own. The energy contained within was something that even he himself was somewhat unable to control.</p><br/><p>The people in Rock City were completely stunned. At this moment, they had even forgotten the fear of death, the despair of their country\u2019s destruction. In their hearts, only a deep sense of respect and admiration were left.</p><br/><p>Even those from the nearby villages and those fleeing from the disasters on the roads could not help but raise their heads; with their breaths held and a steady gaze, they watched the unimaginable scene unfolding in the sky.</p><br/><p>\"Is, is that a god?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone could not help but put their hands together as though they were praying to the two intertwining rivers in the skies. However, their minds were blank, and they did not know what they were praying about.</p><br/><p>They could only\u2026 Instinctively respect and worship.</p><br/><p>However, they soon discovered that these two rivers were not the final form of this magic. Under Benjamin\u2019s control, they were still changing, flying, twisting\u2026 The two rivers seemed to have lives of their own, and as the surging waves were getting compressed together, there suddenly an appearance of what seemed to resemble scales.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a few claws were conjured from the water, and at the end of the rivers, from the scattered flow of water, a blurry shape was being carved out, like the head of some beast.</p><br/><p>When the people below saw this, it was as though an electric shock had zapped them through their spines; their entire bodies could not help but tremble. They did not understand what magic Benjamin had cast, but they felt that they were witnessing the birth of an ancient, gigantic beast capable of splitting up the heavens and the earth.</p><br/><p>Very soon, someone came to their senses.</p><br/><p>\"Are those\u2026 Dragons?\"</p><br/><p>When the endpoints of the rivers had been carved into heads, the people thought of the evil dragon in the legends. Except that, their shapes seemed to be somewhat different from that in the legends.</p><br/><p>Huge horns, like those of a reindeer; two long, flowy beards, and eyeballs that were clearly made out of pure water. Within them, an unimaginable light was shining through\u2026 The rivers had turned into two gigantic beasts. They were familiar to the people, but at the same time, felt exceptionally strange.</p><br/><p>Their bodies were very long, as though they were still the rivers that had appeared just now, and were still twisting about in precise symmetry, dancing as though they were chasing something. Taking a closer look, the people could see that, right in the middle of the two gigantic beasts, was Benjamin\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>It was a Benjamin who was speeding toward the cannonballs of Holy Light.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2026 What magic is that? What is he trying to do? Can that thing stop the cannonballs of Holy Light?\" Even the priest widened his eyes, and could not help but speak.</p><br/><p>Could this mage have become as powerful as this?</p><br/><p>Although he was somewhat unable to accept this truth, at the moment, he discovered for the first time that after witnessing such a scene, there were doubts in his heart about whether the cannonballs of Holy Light could really defeat Rock City.</p><br/><p>Something seemed to have been shaken\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Terrible! Terrible! What monsters are those?\" General Press, although far away, had been shocked into taking a few steps back, \"His Highness the Pope, had competed against such a person, then\u2026 Doesn\u2019t that mean that His Highness the Pope is fast becoming a god? This world is crazy!\"</p><br/><p>The gigantic beasts in the skies were still flying and dancing; their bodies were still somewhat blurry, seemingly still in the process of formation. The people below did not know what they were going to become.</p><br/><p>Both the people of Icor and the people of the Kingdom of Helius had a strangely unified feeling in their hearts\u2014 fear, respect, and expectation.</p><br/><p>What form would this magic ultimately take?</p><br/><p>However, they didn't seem to have the luxury of time to wait until the final form of the two gigantic beasts. Just as what Benjamin had realized from the start, the time left for him was not much.</p><br/><p>\"What a pity\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin suddenly muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>In the process of creating the giant dragon, he suddenly had a weird sensation. It was as though he was leaving this world; the clear, blue sky before his eyes became a more striking shade of blue, as though the shadows of some runes were appearing from within\u2026</p><br/><p>He felt the elemental plane, as well as the overlapping of two worlds.</p><br/><p>The incredible burden on his spiritual energy made him feel somewhat suffocated. But, on the other hand, an unexplainable, indescribable thing was swirling about in his thoughts; he felt that, if he was given a bit more, he would be able to reach some epiphany.</p><br/><p>However, he did not have that much time.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the moment he lifted his head, he felt an incomparable resentment.</p><br/><p>\"What a pity\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The simple words to himself had just left his lips when they were completely drowned out by a subsequently thunderous noise.</p><br/><p>Because, as hundreds of thousands of people watched eagerly, the cannonballs of Holy Light, at least 60 of them, that had been flying for a long time, had finally collided with the two gigantic dragons!</p><br/><p>Bham!</p><br/><p>The thunderous sound erupted, and everyone instinctively fell to the ground. It was only after quite a while before they dared to carefully peek upwards.</p><br/><p>They could only see, in the skies where the two had collided, that Holy Light and the flows of water had violently splashed apart, and were entirely separated. They had spread in every direction at the same time, forming two stretches of mirror-like surfaces; the one on the top was a dazzling and purely white reflection of light, whereas the one at the bottom was a clear, bright stretch of a water's surface. Other than these, every impurity had been refined. The mirror surfaces looked so pure that it was somewhat unbelievable.</p><br/><p>The light and water dispersed, and soon covered the entire sky, having a diameter of a few kilometers. No one could see the sun anymore.</p><br/><p>Everyone was stunned, rooted to their spots.</p><br/><p>The scene in the skies seemed to have surpassed their understanding. Was that an explosion? However, from the two mirror surfaces set out smoothly like some graphs, they could not see any destruction or any losses of control, and instead\u2026 There was a strange beauty.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, after spreading to a certain extent, the two mirror surfaces had suddenly come to a halt, no longer moving, yet neither of them was disappearing; it was as though they had solidified for some strange elemental phenomenon. A sky appeared once more above Rock City.</p><br/><p>\"Good heavens, this\u2026 What should we do? Wait, where is Director Benjamin?\"</p><br/><p>The mages looked around frantically, and finally, discovered that, under the mirror surfaces, a figure had appeared out of nothing, floating slowly.</p><br/><p>Seeing this scene, they thought that they had produced some sort of illusion.</p><br/><p>What magic was this?</p><br/><p>The scene just now was completely beyond their understanding; the mirror surfaces of the light and water were still explainable using the element theory, but\u2026 Benjamin, like the apparition of a mirage, had appeared bit by bit from the empty sky, as strange as a spirit.</p><br/><p>And, after Benjamin\u2019s appearance, the mages below discovered that this body was starting to shake, as though\u2026 it was in an extreme pain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Of course, this helped in perfecting the system and fixed several loopholes that they might have missed.</p><br/><p>Since the duration was being extended, other than the first few days, the following discussions were moved to the zone where the three countries crossed. Benjamin also returned to the academy and pretended to be a fool. When someone came to ask him about his relationship with the new system, he said he was busy rebuilding academy and that he knew nothing about the incident.</p><br/><p>Of course, saying that he was busy rebuilding the academy was also not technically considered as a lie.</p><br/><p>While Benjamin went to Icor, with the efforts of the teachers in the academy, the final exam ended smoothly and the first semester ended with all the difficulties. Most of the students left the college and went home to enjoy their one-month holiday, whereas the teachers who had worked so hard for such a long time also had a vacation. Therefore, the academy suddenly became very lifeless.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the manpower needed to rebuild the town was a little lacking, and Benjamin needed to spend a lot of time here.</p><br/><p>The dark corner of the academy that was built previously finally began to have its use. They worked hard to create public discussions among the people so that people from the three different countries could accept the alliance between the three nations and the new turn-based ruling system. In addition to that, Icor\u2019s rejection toward him had also gradually resolved.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the place of discussion between the three countries was not too far away from the academy. Therefore, Benjamin could often take some time off the night to secretly meet the guild master and be updated on the progress.</p><br/><p>In short, this seemingly absurd system seemed to be gradually getting on track.</p><br/><p>\"Their arguments are very interesting, even though they have no truly understood the significance of this system. The details of the Judgement Parliament have been finalized, yet they are still debating on who will be the first one to be ruling.\"</p><br/><p>About a month later, the discussion had come to an end, and the guild master could not help but complain.</p><br/><p>Benjamin heard it, shook his head and smiled.</p><br/><p>After all, the people of this generation had yet to come across such system, so they cannot see the end of it. Once the system started working, they would then understand that their concern was as pointless as whether to take the left foot first or the right foot first.</p><br/><p>\"Is the list of the first batch of ruling council members out?\" He asked.</p><br/><p>\"It was out yesterday,\" The guild master nodded and said, \"You and the other 20 academy mages\u2019 names are in it. You do not have any objections, do you?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shrugged,: \"Of course not.\"</p><br/><p>This was already a very big proportion, how could he not be satisfied?</p><br/><p>Regarding the member mages of the Judgement Parliament, they were currently being elected, but in the future, it would certainly be changed. In short, their target was prestigious and neutral mages. As time passed, the most famous people of the mage community would certainly be students of the mages academy.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was confident on this.</p><br/><p>\"Oh yeah... what happened to the Kingdom of Helius? I tried to get in touch with the people there, but I did not get any response,\" He thought about this and suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>During this period of time, he continuously wrote to the Fulner family. However, the priest who had been secretly helping them to deliver the letters disappeared a few months ago.</p><br/><p>Benjamin could not help but feel strange about it.</p><br/><p>His information network had just begun to develop, but it was not able to reach the Kingdom of Helius. Therefore, he knew nothing about the situation there.</p><br/><p>\"The recent inspection of Crusader gateway have become stricter, and it is hard for me to find trustable information,\" The guild master replied, \"But there are indications showing that there is a chaos within the church, so they have no time to take our actions into account.\"</p><br/><p>\"... An internal affair?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin held his chin and nodded.</p><br/><p>He suddenly remembered the conversation between the two priests that he eavesdropped at the Abandoned Valley of Gods. Based on their conversation, it did sound like there was an internal affair in the Church. However, would the news about the internal war of the church spread out that quickly?</p><br/><p>And the main point was if there really was a civil war within the church, would they get an opportunity to do something?</p><br/><p>After thinking about it, he still felt like it was very scary to be in the dark. He would not be alerted if something bad were to happen, or that he might miss a good opportunity in just a blink of an eye. Therefore, they needed to have spies in the Kingdom of Helius.</p><br/><p>Benjamin left the secret chamber late at night and returned to the academy. After thinking about it for a moment, he gathered the people in charge of the black operation of the academy.</p><br/><p>\"Sir, is there anything that we need to do?\"</p><br/><p>The Knight kneeled on his knee. As a mercenary saved by Benjamin during the \"Seven Days of Hell,\" Edmund became one of the people in charge of the black operation of the academy; every time he met Benjamin, he would respect Benjamin as though he was his master.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was actually not used to it, yet he did not say anything. Since he wanted the plan to work, having such a ritual was crucial, right?</p><br/><p>\"I need you to enter the Kingdom of Helius and establish a new information base there,\" Benjamin said, beckoning for Edmund to stand up.</p><br/><p>Edmund thought for a moment and said, \"Sir, the custom is very strict there. After we get in, I am afraid that it will be hard for us to have a stable contact the academy.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin took a few pieces of transmission wood pieces out and handed it to Edmund.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t worry, just take this and you can report to me freely about what you know found in the Kingdom of Helius,\" He said slowly, \"Do not worry about the custom. I'll send you there straight from the mountains and nobody will find out about the transmission wood piece you have on you.\"</p><br/><p>Edmund heard that, held the transmission wood piece in his hand and nodded enthusiastically, \"Yes, Sir.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin smiled encouragingly.</p><br/><p>It was not a relaxing task. Sneaking deep into the Kingdom of Helius, Edmund seemed to be prepared to give his life away. Being able to have such a group of people to fight for him, it was this kind of unconditional loyalty that Benjamin might never get used to, nevertheless, he was still touched.</p><br/><p>The work of rebuilding the town was basically complete; in less than a week, the academy would reopen. He could take two days off and send these group of people there.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>When he thought about the Kingdom of Helius, a question popped into his mind.</p><br/><p>Previously, he helped Elizabeth along with a group of mages sneak out, and allowed them to join the magic academy. However, since then, Benjamin had never seen those people again.</p><br/><p>A few months\u2019 time had passed, even if that group of mages had walked slowly with their legs, they should still have reached the academy, right?</p><br/><p>Benjamin had no choice. Therefore, while Edmund was leaving, he ordered him to make use of the information network to search for the whereabouts of that group of people.</p><br/><p>A group with absolutely no knowledge about the outside world, could there have been an accident?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

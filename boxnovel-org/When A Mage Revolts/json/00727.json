There were also a few large ships tied up by the shore. The soldiers were busy, carefully moving grain reserves onto the ship.</p><br/><p>One of the commanding officers that was riding on a horse, stared at the flowing river as he asked.</p><br/><p>\"Of course. There\u2019s someone staring at our troops even now.\" Next to him, a priest, who was always on horseback, coldly spurted, \"The scouts that we\u2019ve met earlier were the best proof.\"</p><br/><p>\"And... those here for the forage, are they many?\"</p><br/><p>\"It should not be many. It may even just be one.\" The priest responded, \"I do not wish to speak his name so please do not ask. Just pretend nothing is going on and continue with our journey.\"</p><br/><p>However, after hearing these words, the commanding officer was struck by a thought and became filled with bewilderment.</p><br/><p>\"Wh-What? Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s that... That overseas....\"</p><br/><p>The priest looked impatient but after being pressured by the other party, still ended up nodding. The commanding officer saw the affirmation and turned pale.</p><br/><p>\"Father Carriere, then... Then what should we do? There should be some arrangement by the higher-ups, right? Or... Or else none of us will walk away today.\"</p><br/><p>Priest Carriere shook his head and let out a cold snort, \"You need not know more. Just have your troops continue as is.\"</p><br/><p>The commanding officer still remained pale white and hesitated for a moment before making one last attempt, \"Then... For our god\u2019s sake, could you at least let me know if our team of forage was bait from the very beginning?\"</p><br/><p>Priest Carriere cast a sidelong glance at him and went briefly silent. He then shook his head in response to the question.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, the commanding officer was still upset after obtaining the answer. He remained motionless on the back of the horse and stared at the busy soldiers. Suddenly, he turned vicious.</p><br/><p>\"What the hell are you doing? Slowpokes... Faster, I say! What are you standing there for? A break? If you\u2019re not done moving in half an hour, none of you will have anything to eat!\"</p><br/><p>He suddenly grabbed a whip and lashed out at a few unlucky soldiers. The soldiers bit their tongues and could only lower their head as he dragged one sack after another with all their might up onto the deck.</p><br/><p>They did not get it. The commanding officer was fine earlier, why the sudden change?</p><br/><p>However, under the urging of a tyrannical boss, the efficiency of the forage moving took a huge leap. After half an hour, a few thousand sacks were moved onto the ship. The sailors waved their hands to the army on land, gesturing them to come aboard.</p><br/><p>The commanding officer let out a sigh of relief at the sight.</p><br/><p>As long as they were sailing on board, the distance to the Town of Crewe would gradually get shorter. That area was heavily guarded and no matter how powerful that mage may be, he shouldn't be able to do them much harm, right?</p><br/><p>Moreover, Priest Carriere mentioned his forthcoming but it didn\u2019t guarantee his arrival. He could only pray hard in his heart and hope that God protects them and that this devil does not show up.</p><br/><p>However...</p><br/><p>\"Wh-What\u2019s going on? The ship is sinking! Where\u2019s the leak? You there, go and check the storage area!\"</p><br/><p>The commanding officer had yet to dock the ship but there were already continuous screams and shouts coming from the ship. The scene instantly became chaotic. Those soldiers who were in the midst of boarding ran back to land while the sailors ran about checking the flooring of the ship\u2019s hold in an effort to find the leak.</p><br/><p>Only Priest Carriere fixed his gaze on the sinking ship with a calm demeanor. He did look puzzled in the slightest.</p><br/><p>... Was he here?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t long before the sailors who went down below to check came rushing out, yelling, \"There\u2019s no hole! Our ship is all good. There is no leak!\"</p><br/><p>\"No leak? Why would it sink if there\u2019s no leak? You good-for-nothings, scram down there and check again!\"</p><br/><p>\"But...\"</p><br/><p>\"Enough nonsense. Get down there!\"</p><br/><p>The sailors were still preoccupied with rescuing the forage and ship while the commanding officer on land was sweating through his palms. At that moment, he had even forgotten to instruct the soldiers to salvage the forage. He was already drowning in despair.</p><br/><p>No leak... Yet they were sinking, need he say more?</p><br/><p>He felt chills. Such a vast ship. A ship that could steadily sail in violent waters... was engulfed by some power and was now slowly sinking downwards. He felt as if he himself was also on that ship, slowly sinking into the murky waters.</p><br/><p>Then... Who could possibly save him?</p><br/><p>The commanding officer went blank but quickly turned his head and ran to Priest Carriere. He spoke with fear as his voice quivered, \"Great Father, he is here! You will protect us, right? What kind of monster is he to drag down such a huge ship?\"</p><br/><p>The priest stared at the sinking ship without uttering a word, nor did he do anything.</p><br/><p>This attitude sent the commanding officer in a nervous panic. He thought that the priest may have lost his mind and had no preparation whatsoever for the arrival of that devil. If so, their fate might be sealed.</p><br/><p>Oh god... Why did things turn out like this?</p><br/><p>And so, the humongous ship powerlessly sunk to the bottom of the river as the sailors\u2019 screamed out and the soldiers on land helplessly watched on. A few of the sailors swam out, with a confused expression. They simply could not fathom this unexplainable situation.</p><br/><p>As the arch of the flagpole disappeared into the waters, the river valley fell into a dead silence.</p><br/><p>The commanding officer was stunned.</p><br/><p>No... No sudden appearance of a figure?</p><br/><p>His heart palpated rapidly, shocking him out of his stunned state. He then carefully crept toward the river, glancing about as he crept forward. However, only the gushing river waters could be seen. Everything looked normal, as if the vast transport ship had vanished into thin air.</p><br/><p>Although this scene gave him goosebumps, the commanding officer was struck a thought and immediately revealed a smile.</p><br/><p>That devil... He didn\u2019t plan to kill them?</p><br/><p>A maelstrom of thoughts invaded his head. He turned and looked at Priest Carriere. But at that exact moment, the priest\u2019s face darkened.</p><br/><p>\"Trying to escape?\"</p><br/><p>A deep voice was uttered from his throat, unsure who the message was directed at. The commanding officer did not comprehend this but saw a flash of a holy light beside the priest; six light wings emerged from his back, like a god descending on to the earth. It was majestic beyond words.</p><br/><p>With a flap of the wings, the priest vanished on the spot. His whereabouts, unknown.</p><br/><p>The river valley returned to its peaceful state, but the face of the commanding officer was left with absolute shock. He stared at the position where Priest Carriere had disappeared from moments ago. He did not move an inch, almost as though he was hit with a binding spell.</p><br/><p>The soldiers and sailors around him watched with much confusion. They did not know what was going on.</p><br/><p>After a long pause, the commanding officer came back to his senses.</p><br/><p>\"Oh... Oh my god\u2026..\" He mumbled, \"Father Carriere? Tha-That was His Highness the Pope!\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

From a human\u2019s perspective, blue represented the element of water while white represented the element of light. All of these were previously known to be true.</p><br/><p>As such, Benjamin recognized the elemental signatures from the six glowing mists.</p><br/><p>Could all these really be\u2026 elements?</p><br/><p>Benjamin decided to channel his spiritual energy towards the \"emotions\" in order to try to get a response. Unfortunately, he realized that it was difficult for him to do so right now. His current self only existed in his spiritual state. How would it be possible for him to exert even more spiritual energy?</p><br/><p>Moreover, every time he pulled himself out of reality to enter these strange planes of existences, it would be challenging for him to control his actions. For example, right now his movements were limited to drifting in this mist infused state, unable to produce anything even remotely close to the buzzing noise he was hearing.</p><br/><p>But, if these glowing mists were truly related to the elements\u2026</p><br/><p>A thought came to Benjamin\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>At this point, he had completely transformed into part of the glowing mist himself. As such, he controlled his mist-like being to drift slowly and form a runic shape.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>When he turned himself into a rune, a sudden humming sound seemed to emit from within him, briefly giving him a scare. He sensed felt his voice leave his body and he sensed impending danger.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s happening?...</p><br/><p>At that instant, a surge of warmth rushed outward from the surrounding glowing mists. In addition to this, he also felt his consciousness gradually disperse. It was as if his consciousness was trying to fuse with the rest of the mist.</p><br/><p>He urgently broke the runic formation and returned back to the previous drifting state. When the runic structure was no more, the merging sensation disappeared as well.</p><br/><p>Benjamin breathed a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>He assumed that his soul or spirit had entered this place. If he were to become one with the mists, then there would be no way for his return. Benjamin\u2019s body, in reality, would become a soulless husk.</p><br/><p>That aside, the fact that warmth could be felt from the runes pointed towards the existence of conscious elemental beings\u2026 Could this be a unique elemental plane of existence?</p><br/><p>Perhaps these six elemental planes did not exist independently but rather were connected at an intersecting point. Benjamin\u2019s location may possibly be that point.</p><br/><p>When he put together this theory, a bold thought appeared in Benjamin\u2019s mind. In his previous visits to the pure blue world, there was always something weird he could bring back. This time around, he had entered an intersection point between planes. Perhaps\u2026 Could he acquire more than just water elemental magic?</p><br/><p>However, while occupied with how to contain the surrounding glowing mists, a sudden voice reached out from within him.</p><br/><p>\"Helloooo\u2026 are you still here? Have you entered the elemental planes?\"</p><br/><p>It was the System\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was surprised slightly. Whenever entered the pure blue world, his connection with the System would immediately disconnect \u2014 with the exception of that one time the System had broken apart. It was certainly unexpected that the System could now directly connect to his soul to communicate.</p><br/><p>\"Can you\u2026 hear me when I talk?\" He asked rather curiously.</p><br/><p>\"I can hear you.\" Without a doubt, The System\u2019s presence was still as strong as ever; his voice was crisp and clear, as if it came from within Benjamin\u2019s soul, \"What do you see? Answer me now!\"</p><br/><p>\"Very well then.\" Benjamin replied earnestly, \"This is truly a foreign place, glowing mists in six colors are scattered everywhere, probably representing the six different kinds of elements. I seemed to have transformed into a cloud of mists myself; this is rather bizarre.\"</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s so odd about it? Spiritual energy had always been in cloud-like forms.\" The System then replied, \"Be careful in there, if you are absorbed by those things, then not even I can save you.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s heart skipped a beat.</p><br/><p>\"Do you know what goes on in here?\"</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s not like you haven\u2019t been here before. Why do look like you\u2019ve seen a ghost?\" The System hissed in annoyance, \"Isn\u2019t this the elemental place? Didn\u2019t you come here multiple times?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was confused, \"Wait, isn\u2019t this the intersection between the six elemental planes? I certainly have not been here before.\"</p><br/><p>\"Intersection between the six elemental planes? You\u2019re overthinking it, why would there be six in the first place? It had always been just one plane; you came to the same one every single time.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was stunned.</p><br/><p>What did it mean by that?</p><br/><p>\"The elemental plane had always been an intersection for multiples elements, a center point for these elements to act in their purest forms.\" The System continued, \"Did you\u2026 believe that each element had their own specialized place? Why would you think that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Because\u2026 each time I came here, I could only see a plane of pure blue?\"</p><br/><p>The System briefly went silent before eventually sighing, \"No wonder\u2026 It\u2019s alright, it\u2019s the kind of perspective only lower lifeforms would have.\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin had no response to that whatsoever.</p><br/><p>Aside from that baseless mockery, what The System said did sort of make sense. Did he mean that the pure blue world he had previously seen, along with the pure white world the fourth-generation pope saw, were all actually the same place? Was it just that their practice of magic was different which was why they perceived the same world to be different?</p><br/><p>Inconceivable.</p><br/><p>\"If that\u2019s the case, then does this mean the countless glowing mists before me are the true appearance of the elemental place?\" asked Benjamin upon having thought about it.</p><br/><p>\"Although I\u2019m unsure of what you are seeing, I believe this is not the case.\"</p><br/><p>\"Why is that?\"</p><br/><p>\"Because your sensory organs are severely restricted.\" The System maintained a rare serious tone and said, \"Sight, hearing, touch\u2026 the perspectives that you humans so fervently cling on to are inadequate, to say the least. Even though you\u2019re detached from the limits of your physical self, your pattern of analysis relies on your previous perceptions. Within this boundless world, the things that you can perceive are still too scarce.\"</p><br/><p>\"... Speak in a way that normal people can understand.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re utterly hopeless, unable to ever grasp the true appearance of the elemental plane.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was at a loss for words again, but this time also slightly irritated, \"Alright fine, I can\u2019t understand it. Now, can you please elaborate?\"</p><br/><p>\"No, you won\u2019t get it.\" The System tried to explain, \"This plane far exceeds your comprehension. So, every time you come here, you will perceive things differently. In truth, the plane has never changed, it\u2019s just that the state of it that you can see has shifted according to your level of comprehension.\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>As he listened to The The System\u2019s detailed explanations, a feeling of helplessness emerged within Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"...What you\u2019re saying is, that lower life forms could never comprehend the higher planes of existence?\"</p><br/><p>The System replied, \"You could put it that way if that makes you feel better.\"</p><br/><p>Finally, after a long pause, a troubling thought came to Benjamin\u2019s mind and he asked, \"Then\u2026 the elements, magic, what exactly are they?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

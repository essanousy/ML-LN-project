In a flash, the falling crystal ball halted in the air, as if it was hit with the pause button.</p><br/><p>Grant frowned.</p><br/><p>... That easy?</p><br/><p>And right at this moment, streams of water surged and crashed into the suppressed elemental windstorm. Instantly, the elemental windstorm expanded once again with the boost of water elements. The golden glow couldn\u2019t seem to hold it any further.</p><br/><p>\"You...\" Grant realized something was amiss and stared at Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"It looks as though you really want this water crystal ball? It\u2019s quite alright, I\u2019ll give it to you. It\u2019s not as if the academy couldn\u2019t replicate a pile of this.\" Benjamin smiled, \"Apart from this, I still could gift you a huge ball.\"</p><br/><p>After his proclamation, more water elements gushed into the elemental windstorm. The golden glow was still earnestly suppressing but the expansion of the elemental windstorm was simply unstoppable. In a blink of an eye, it filled the entire sky. Grant could only take the backseat as solemnity was written all over his face.</p><br/><p>Within this violent elemental windstorm, he could even feel that some sort of transformation was brewing silently.</p><br/><p>From the outside, it was a huge golden balloon, continuously expanding, expanding... Any larger, and it may explode!</p><br/><p>Grant made efforts to distance himself from this dangerous storm.</p><br/><p>\"Scared already?\" Benjamin let out cold smile, \"Then... Why don\u2019t you try this?\"</p><br/><p>He suddenly pulled out a cloth bag and opened it up. In it were water elemental crystals. An approximate count would have it around the twenties.</p><br/><p>Ever since he learnt the Elemental Order - Destroy; honestly speaking, Benjamin has yet to allow the elemental windstorm expand to this stage. At the moment, although he could control with considerable difficulty with the rune but the enormous being in front of him was at the verge of losing control. If it wasn\u2019t due to the layer of golden glow that was pushing against it, it would be quite a bit of magic whirling around.</p><br/><p>Now, if Benjamin were to toss in a bag of water elemental crystals...</p><br/><p>\"Have you lost your mind?\"</p><br/><p>Grant\u2019s expression immediately changed. He extended his arm to lightly dab, removing the golden glow that was suppressing the elemental windstorm. Soon, the elemental windstorm was spreading out like a black hole. He then slowly gave a push that the cross of holy light leaped over to the expanding elemental windstorm.</p><br/><p>He intends to forcefully extinguish this windstorm?</p><br/><p>Benjamin did not hesitate any longer and flung the water elemental crystals over!</p><br/><p>From afar, the entire scenery was engulfed by this elemental windstorm. That enormous ball shaped windstorm was more radiant than the sun, as if harnessing energy to destroy the river valley. The cross pushed on by Grant and the twenty something water elemental crystals were simply too small.</p><br/><p>However, after a few seconds, the two were inhaled into the elemental windstorm. It was the beginning of a transformation!</p><br/><p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p><br/><p>A series of explosions was coming from the windstorm. There seemed to be a horrible chemical reaction happening deep within. That expanding windstorm suddenly halted spreading and started to shrink at the speed of light.</p><br/><p>Benjamin couldn\u2019t help but drop his jaw.</p><br/><p>What was happening...</p><br/><p>He could sense a hint of destruction coming from the windstorm. Just as he wanted to seize control over this thingy that contained unknown quantities of water elements, it had already broken away from his control.</p><br/><p>\u2014 Even when he dispersed the rune, the elemental windstorm did not show any signs of slowing down, it continued to shrink and transmitting strings crackling sounds internally as waves of pressuring magic oscillation spread out.</p><br/><p>\"Enough... You only know how to get things out of hand and never thought when to stop.\"</p><br/><p>Grant\u2019s voice was filled with rage. At that moment, he took out a string with a golden pendant from his robe. He raised the pendant and proceeded to smash the sapphire within.</p><br/><p>A white light then shone from his raised hand. He faced the palm of his hand at the elemental windstorm. The white ray was like the first ray of sunlight at dawn, penetrating the shrinking elemental windstorm to its core.</p><br/><p>The windstorm ceased condensing. It seemed as though that ray restrained it.</p><br/><p>\"This bastard... Just how many secret weapons does he have?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s brows were tied in a knot. There wasn\u2019t many seconds left for \"Descending of Water\" and the elemental windstorm before him was the one thing he was counting on. If it was overcame, then the battle today would be certain defeat.</p><br/><p>However, because the elemental windstorm was restrained, Benjamin could sense the inclination of losing control was disappearing \u2014 He could finally regain control over that elemental windstorm created by the rune.</p><br/><p>Hence, he draw another string of rune characters and controlled the elemental windstorm to head towards Grant.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s no use. You can\u2019t kill me.\"</p><br/><p>Grant kept his cool over this. The ray of light in his hand was still ongoing. Under the illumination of the ray, the elemental windstorm started to wither.</p><br/><p>Benjamin could feel a similar scent of the elemental plane coming from the ray. It was mixed with some sort of higher law power that even the most violent element could do no harm.</p><br/><p>How fearful...</p><br/><p>The Church could already develop such magic tools?</p><br/><p>No, it wasn\u2019t some typical magic tool or else the System would have seen the related blueprint during that moment of prying. Benjamin could not explain what sort of energy it was but he guessed that this thing must be a precious item from the elemental plane and could not be duplicated.</p><br/><p>Seeing how Grant sacrificed such a valuable item, Benjamin did not have to hold back.</p><br/><p>\"... Alright, then let\u2019s test that theory.\"</p><br/><p>As he controlled the elemental windstorm, he took out the real water crystal ball.</p><br/><p>Activate and toss\u2026.. The entire process was done with such fluidity and completed in mere seconds. However, Benjamin\u2019s aim was not Grant but rather the elemental windstorm.</p><br/><p>\u2014 He had handed over the water crystal ball to Morris to research. Morris had attempted to duplicate but was left with a pile of failures, just as the fake he tossed earlier. What Morris had said about it was that this water crystal ball contained some elements he couldn\u2019t decipher, that could stand outside the law of magic.</p><br/><p>Such an existence could not be bounded by that ray of white light.</p><br/><p>Benjamin did not dare to hold back any longer. Even if after today, this unique water crystal ball would be no more, he could not allow Grant to monopolize this battle!</p><br/><p>And so, as just the withering elemental windstorm was at halfway at its peak; with a whoosh, the activated water crystal ball flew into it.</p><br/><p>The few seconds of silence, was the calm before the storm.</p><br/><p>What ensued, was a loud bang.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

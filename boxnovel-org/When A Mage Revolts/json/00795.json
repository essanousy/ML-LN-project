The other paladins and priests have disappeared at the moment. All they could do now was hold up their psychic suppressing cross and summon a light film to protect themselves.</p><br/><p>They kept looking around, trying to figure out where they were. All they still saw was the forest that they previously entered, but in this forest with no signs of humans, there was a steady stream of invisible attacks coming from everywhere. During the first round of sudden attacks, they suffered a heavy loss, and if it was not for the Bishop\u2019s quick actions, they might have been completely wiped out.</p><br/><p>However... the state that they were in now was not that different from being completely wiped out.</p><br/><p>\"We must have been caught in their spell, which is why we are hallucinating.\" A priest said so.</p><br/><p>The Bishop sneered and did not speak.</p><br/><p>Clearly? Being constantly attacked by invisible things, some of their people disappeared mysteriously, if it was not an illusion, what could it be? But he was still a little surprised, they had the touch of holy light, why were they still trapped in the illusion made by their enemy?</p><br/><p>Something must went wrong.</p><br/><p>They have tried to retaliate while they were trapped here. However, they cannot even see the attacks. Even if they were to throw a holy light bomb, the few trees that they hit might not even actually exist, and it will be of no help to them.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the bishop did not act rashly.</p><br/><p>\"Hold on for a while... they will not be able to maintain the illusion for that long. We have holy weapons with us, they will definitely be not able to break through this line of defense.\"</p><br/><p>Beyond the light film, the border of the holy light was shining dazzlingly. The priests could see that invisible objects were being constantly thrown onto the barrier, causing small fluctuations of holy light, but based on the power of the attacks, it was not too frightening.</p><br/><p>---- Otherwise, they will certainly not be able to withstand it.</p><br/><p>In the meantime, it was just like what they have expected, the atmosphere was getting tense, and the faces of the people from the overseas Church did not seem that well.</p><br/><p>\"How can two layers of filthy light be so hard to deal with?\"</p><br/><p>An elder with a black mask standing outside of the border said while he looked at the dozens of priests hiding within the light film barrier.</p><br/><p>Two other elders who were dressed identical to him were standing beside him, along with dozens of flamens dressed in robes. The flamens tried to use spells on the priests, but unfortunately, whenever their spiritual energy contacted with that layer of light film, it was completely blocked, therefore useless.</p><br/><p>From their point of view, the group of priests were trapped in a steep valley, and roughly dozens of magic beast were attacking the light barrier. Unfortunately, no matter what sort of attacks the magic beasts made, be it biting or blowing out fire balls and wind blades, the huge light barrier was not even scratched.</p><br/><p>They have been constantly attacking for about half an hour, but it was still the same, so they could not help but to be a little perturbed.</p><br/><p>\"The goddess loves peace and never advocates violence.\" Another elder spoke with a husky voice: \"The talent that she gave us will naturally won\u2019t be as violent compared to the defiled followers.\"</p><br/><p>A flamen came and asked: \"Elders, if our psychic powers are cut off... we can at most control the magic beast for another fifteen minutes, if it is still unbreakable, what should we do?\"</p><br/><p>\"It doesn\u2019t matter, since they are trapped in the illusion, they will definitely tire.\" The elder was not impatient and he slowly said, \"We will deal with these people first, the rest of the isolated followers, we can deal with them later. Do not worry, the blessings of our ancestors can last for a month, do you think they can withstand it for that long?\"</p><br/><p>The flamen heard it, quickly nodded and said fawningly: \"You are right, Elder!\"</p><br/><p>Then, he turned around, looked at the priests that were being trapped together, and he gradually calmed down.</p><br/><p>All the people from the overseas Church were standing in a row, while they coldly watched as the priests slowly moved towards their deaths. They have given up using psychic powers to attack, only the magic beasts were being controlled to be launched at the light film barrier, this will deplete their opponents\u2019 spiritual energy and at the same time pressure them.</p><br/><p>This was their territory, which belonged to the goddess. No matter how strong their opponents were, they all believe that those defiled followers will not be able to do anything significant!</p><br/><p>However, they did not notice that three sneaky figures appeared tens of meters behind them.</p><br/><p>\"... The elders, they have all gathered here.\"</p><br/><p>The two siblings looked at the group of familiar figures in a distance, there were hatred in their eyes, and they tried to suppress their voices as they said.</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded.</p><br/><p>\"The people from the Church... they seem to be surrounded by them?\" He muttered to himself while he observed the situation. \"As expected, they were being caught in an illusion, otherwise, the Church will definitely not be afraid of the attacks of magic beasts.\"</p><br/><p>\"Brother Benjamin, what should we do?\" The girl turned her head and asked.</p><br/><p>\"I need to help those priests.\" Benjamin said while holding his chin and whispered, \"If they were that easily killed by the illusion, then it will ruin my plan.\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah... we need to help them again?\"</p><br/><p>\"This is just part of the plan. Believe me, by the end of this, be it flamens, elders, priest or bishops, no one will walk out of this island alive.\"</p><br/><p>The two siblings were shocked by his murderous tone, they nodded, regained their composure and asked: \"Then... how should we help them?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin replied: \"We need to dispel this illusion. When the illusion is gone, the people from the Church will get the opportunity to retaliate.\"</p><br/><p>The young boy said: \"But the ancestral will is too strong, there\u2019s no way for us to fight it.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin heard that and could not help but to ponder. He did not know anything about how this stuff was made, so cracking it would be difficult. He could drop a huge soundproof ice hockey ball from the sky, and waken the people from the Church, but that would be way too obvious.</p><br/><p>In order to take advantage of the situation, he cannot show himself until the last step.</p><br/><p>After thinking about it for a moment, he suddenly whispered: \"Did you not say previously that your ancestors are buried here? Can you bring me over and have a look.\"</p><br/><p>When they heard this request, the two siblings could not help but to shiver a little, it might be the trauma from their dark past that was affecting them. However, when they saw Benjamin\u2019s determined eyes, they quickly recovered, took a deep breath and nodded.</p><br/><p>\"... Ok, we will bring you there now.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin followed behind the two siblings, quietly left the battlefield, and headed towards the legendary forbidden land. The people from the church and the overseas church will still be occupied for a long time, and since all of their attention was drawn on other, no one can stop Benjamin.</p><br/><p>On the way there, he found that as the two siblings were walking, their bodies started to tremble slightly. Benjamin reached out his hands, patted them on their shoulders and comforted them, \"Do not be afraid, the ancestral spirits are just spirits with a more powerful spiritual energy. I have personally caught a large number of spirits, what are you afraid of?\"</p><br/><p>The girl took a deep breath, turned back, and clenched her teeth: \"We... we are not afraid, but it\u2019s our first time coming to this place, we are a little... a little...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin smiled and shook his head: \"Don\u2019t worry.\"</p><br/><p>Eventually, after carefully moving forward for five minutes, they entered a cave.</p><br/><p>The cave was empty, and there was a strange atmosphere in the air, even the ground turned gray-white. Two alert flamens were guarding in front of the cave, they were dressed in long robes and they were given a heavy responsibility of guarding the forbidden land. They were probably the only one who were not involved in the attack against the people from the church.</p><br/><p>However, they turned their heads from time to time and looked at the direction of the battlefield, it seemed like they were very concerned about the battle.</p><br/><p>\"I want to participate in the attack too. It will be a supreme deed to be able to get rid of defiled followers. Otherwise, we may not be able to ascend into the realm of God and receive the blessing of the goddess.\"</p><br/><p>\"Do not think that way, there are still some other defiled followers who were lost in the illusion. Our mission is guard the forbidden land, but if some defiled followers bump into us, then we will get the opportunity to do a good deed, right?\"</p><br/><p>\"I hope so ...\"</p><br/><p>However, while the two priests were talking to each other quietly, suddenly, three figures came out of nowhere and appeared right in front of their eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Are you happy now? It\u2019s your chance to render a meritorious deed.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin smiled, flying ice blades were hovering in the sky like a flock of birds, and it flew towards the two priests without warning.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

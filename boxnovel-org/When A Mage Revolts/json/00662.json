As it turned out, it was not just mages who had been learning magic for many years and reached bottleneck that could construct runes within their spiritual energy, other mages could do the same.</p><br/><p>In fact, aside from the students from the entire academy, over a hundred teachers there could all adopt that method to practice magic.</p><br/><p>After researching, they also discovered that clustering runes required a certain level of spiritual energy as a foundation. Lacking in spiritual energy would result in a reprisal, causing great spiritual damage. Those students who voluntarily participated in the experiment had taken a few weeks of sick leave because of that. However, the damage caused would not be permanent, and since the spiritual energy requirement was not high, mages who had been meditating for a few years would be able to do it.</p><br/><p>In other words, it would be a completely popularized meditation method.</p><br/><p>\"We\u2019ve thoroughly changed the whole magic world,\" Upon realizing that, Benjamin could not help but stand up and say that to all the mages in the research group, \"Maybe one day in the future, clustering runes will become the normality of mages, and as for our original Law of Meditation, it will be known by history as \u2018detours during the age of ignorance\u2019.\"</p><br/><p>All the mages looked at each other after hearing that; they probably did not understand where the point of excitement was.</p><br/><p>Mages who entered the research group were of quite a high standard. However, their attention was still at the present, they did not think about the consequences that those actions would bring towards the making of history.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing that, Benjamin shook his head: \"Forget it... Carry on with your meditation.\"</p><br/><p>For that day to come, it would be a few hundred years later, they still had a lot to do at the moment.</p><br/><p>First of all, they needed to research this way of meditation in more detail.</p><br/><p>Through continuously absorbing the corresponding elements, they could actually strengthen the runes which became more powerful. Yet, they just started trying, who knew if any new problems would arise if they were to continue their practice?</p><br/><p>As he recalled the various experiences he went through for the elemental plane, Benjamin was clear that it was not right for humans to make endless demands as they wished. Using runes to practice magic would be the same as stealing powers off the elemental plane, so it would not be surprising if it would cause side effects or reprisal in the future.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he did not rush to popularize this method in the academy but allowed the mages to continue with their meditation and observe for a long time before he would make a decision.</p><br/><p>During the process, the System would record all kinds of related data so that it could be used for future research purposes.</p><br/><p>\"According to the data analysis of thirty experiments, one can cluster runes when their spiritual energy reaches forty-two points,\" The System concluded, \"Of course, you can take advantage of when the value quantization of the spiritual energy has not spread and set this index to an easily remembered number.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head and said, \"Forget about it, the specific evaluating tools for the values that they\u2019ve set before this have already been produced, it will be too troublesome to change it.\"</p><br/><p>Previously, in order to show magic more clearly, they built this system which was still under testing and had not been popularized. However looking at how things were going, they would need to set a new index for the intensity of the runes.</p><br/><p>Take it slow, not everything was easy...</p><br/><p>Benjamin was clear that it would probably cause an uproar if the news were to spread out of the academy. Thus, everything then was strictly kept as a secret. After compromising, all those who knew about it agreed to stay in the academy for half a year, to meditate with relief and not to deliver any kind of information outwards. The members of the Black Operation of the Academy would also watch over their actions discretely to prevent any accidental situations.</p><br/><p>There was no other way, a lot was at stake, so Benjamin could not be blamed for not trusting them completely.</p><br/><p>Of course, Benjamin always stayed by those people during that period to prevent any leaks of the secret while he observed the research. He utilized the preciseness of the water elemental induction magic to assure that everything was in place.</p><br/><p>It was also because of that that he spent almost all of his time in that month on the matter.</p><br/><p>Putting aside everything outside of the academy and the visitors from the past, everything was handed over to Varys and some other workers from the management. Moreover, nothing serious could really happen in such a short time, thus he could focus on this matter without being distracted.</p><br/><p>It almost felt like he was separated from the outside world; he did not care about what was going on at all.</p><br/><p>In the end, it was the members from the Black Operation of the Academy who sent him news and information, which pulled him out of all the research work and returned to the busy and complicated world.</p><br/><p>\"The Black Operation from the Kingdom of Helius reported that the coronation ceremony has ended a few days ago and Grant Lithur became the pope. Although he still used the name Benjamin among the people, whether it\u2019s the inside of the Church or the social circle of the nobles, everyone has acquiesced his identity.\"</p><br/><p>As he listen to the report, Benjamin could not help but raised his brows.</p><br/><p>\"So... The priests and the nobles had nothing to say about it?\"</p><br/><p>\"They probably have something to say but were all suppressed by the actions of those in power.\" The mercenary took out an envelope and handed it over to Benjamin, \"Previously, many of the nobles have suffered because of that, like this name list over here, it shows the families of those who have been suppressed or exterminated. As for the names of the priests, we had trouble finding it.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin took the envelope and nodded.</p><br/><p>He was quite satisfied with the intelligence work done by the Black Operation of the Academy.</p><br/><p>From finding difficulties in blending in at the Kingdom of Helius to being able to investigate secretive information and even managed to acquire a name list, those people who were sent there had really improved quickly!</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, he did not compliment them but kept a straight face instead and said, \"Keep up the good work, try to find a way to get the name list of the priests.\"</p><br/><p>There was no other way, he realized now that he could not be too integrated with the members and hang out with them when he established the Black Operation. It would be a more natural to build dignity and loyalty by maintaining the attitude of a superior.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the name list of the priest... was really important.</p><br/><p>He could imagine, with Grant\u2019s situation now who had a sensitive identity, and even forcefully became the pope by killing the bishop, it definitely attracted the opposition of many priests. Although he succeeded in his plan, there must be many unseen cracks on the insides of the Church.</p><br/><p>Although he had not decided to make Grant his enemy, it was always good to be prepared.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, it had been a month since he wrote the letter from home; surely Miles would have delivered it by now already? He was not sure how Grant would respond to it, and if there would be a chance for a collaboration.</p><br/><p>As he thought carefully, with Grant\u2019s orientation, it would be normal for him to loathe the Church. Moreover, whether it was gays or mages, they were vulnerable groups who were discriminated against in the Kingdom of Helius. If these vulnerable groups would join forces to fight for equal rights, it would be like success would follow naturally when the conditions were right. Positively thinking, maybe Grant had already initiated a plan to destroy the cathedral of the Church, all he needed was a perfect collaboration.</p><br/><p>And as the pope, if he would really be willing to help eradicate the Church, things would be much easier...</p><br/><p>Benjamin opened the envelope while he thought about all that. He glanced through the name list of the noble victims from the Kingdom of Helius, wanting to know if the Fulner family had suffered through the cleaning as well since they had not contacted him for a while.</p><br/><p>However, with just one look, Benjamin saw a name that never occurred to him at all instead.</p><br/><p>He was stunned by it as if he was struck by a lightning.</p><br/><p>\"The Lithur family has been stripped of their nobility, all the manors have been retrieved, the family members are now commoners. The former duke, Claude Lithur, hanged for offending the dignity of God.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

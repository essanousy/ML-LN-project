Each body had decayed at different rates, but the thick auras of death were gathered together, causing every mage at the scene to feel extremely uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>\"This is going to be fun\u2026\" Even the System spoke, slightly dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the density of the vines instantly increased threefold, spreading out in all directions like an airtight fishing net. The difficulty at which Miles had to dodge now had instantly increased, and the mages were forced to help from the sidelines by summoning a piece of black shadow blade to slice through the vines, giving Miles more space to escape.</p><br/><p>However, the situation of the battle was worsening for them.</p><br/><p>\"How about we just retreat?\" The male mage spoke hesitantly, \"Those revenants are not afraid of magic at all, so how do we fight them? I'm afraid, even the Director would be unable to do much against them\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Although the other mages did not say anything, it was obvious from the looks on their faces that they were agreeable with retreating.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, just as the mages were slowly contemplating the idea, they suddenly saw Benjamin stretch his right hand out. He opened up his palm, and a beam of faint light flashed from his hand. Following that, a half-transparent, blue and unknown creature flew out from his hand.</p><br/><p>They were somewhat stunned.</p><br/><p>\"What is that?\"</p><br/><p>By sensing through their spiritual energy, the dainty humanoid was not something that constituted pure magic, but\u2026 It was some being that possessed an independent life source. A strange, threatening power emanated from its body, causing all the mages to feel their hearts pounding in unison.</p><br/><p>They did not know what that was, but they could faintly feel a power hidden in the agile being somersaulting in the air; a power they could not help but respect.</p><br/><p>\"Has the honorable Director come up with some new magic?\" The male mage did not know what was happening. He could only watch the mysterious blue creature, and sighed subconsciously.</p><br/><p>However, he soon noticed that the attention of the revenants had also shifted.</p><br/><p>Not long after the blue creature had appeared, the three skulls atop the bony shoulders suddenly turned towards Benjamin in unison, with a cracking sound. The soul fires burning in their eye sockets were no longer focused on Miles, but were floating up and down, as though they were now locked onto the blue creature flitting about.</p><br/><p>The revenants had not even done anything, and the male mage was already feeling a change in the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, they seemed to have become nervous.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the astonishment in their hearts increased. What was it the director had conjured up that even these undefeatable undead creatures were taking seriously?</p><br/><p>Miles also came to an abrupt halt on the side of a tree trunk, with an expression of uncertainty on his face. The crazy vines chasing him had, for some reason, all stopped, and the heavy, oppressed feeling in his heart was also slowly fading away as the revenants shifted their attention away from him.</p><br/><p>He lifted his head to look at the mysterious creature Benjamin had summoned.</p><br/><p>He did not know why, but a hostile emotion sparked up within Miles, as though a part of him, deep in his heart, was an instinctive revulsion for the creature\u2026 Hatred, even.</p><br/><p>However, it was at this moment that the three revenants moved first.</p><br/><p>They retrieved the vines that had spread wildly all over the area, and waved their bone staffs, glaring at the blue creature which was flitting about. Subsequently, more and more ashen white flames appeared in the air, and the cold, gloomy aura from them began to disperse.</p><br/><p>Finally, the flames fused together, to form a gigantic, monstrous face. It opened its jaws wide, and flew towards Benjamin!</p><br/><p>\"Director\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The mages could not help but break into a cold sweat.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, all they saw was Benjamin frowning. He did not dodge or try to hide. The blue creature he had summoned raised its arms, and suddenly, an extremely narrow beam of blue light flashed out, piercing through the flames and hitting one of the revenants.</p><br/><p>With a whoosh, before the monstrous face of fire could reach Benjamin, the narrow beam of blue light had pierced right through the glabella of the revenant!</p><br/><p>The body of the revenant shook violently.</p><br/><p>The mages were stunned. They could clearly feel that the thin, blue light constituted of a huge amount of water elements, and elements\u2026 Faced with these intelligent revenants, elements should not have had any sort of destructive effect.</p><br/><p>\"Wait, wait, the aura of the revenant has grown stronger!\"</p><br/><p>However, they soon discovered that the revenant which had been pierced by the thin, blue light had not fallen. Its body was only shaking continuously, but the deathly aura around the body seemed to have thickened, as though the water elements of the thin, blue light had been completely absorbed by it.</p><br/><p>This dampened the mages' hope greatly.</p><br/><p>\"Has it still been eaten up?\"</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Benjamin was not surprised. He nodded instead. Drawing a string of runes and using the Elemental Order - Defense, he temporarily blocked the fiery, monstrous face from hitting his body. Following that, he flew up and bypassed the monstrous face, heading straight towards where the three revenants were.</p><br/><p>The water elemental sprite followed him closely, flitting around him like a satellite.</p><br/><p>The three revenants raised their heads and stared coldly at Benjamin, as though confused about his sudden movement forward.</p><br/><p>However, it was at this moment that he stretched out his hand to draw an extremely simple and short triangular rune.</p><br/><p>The water elemental sprite immediately began getting excited. Vibrating its wings, it crashed headfirst into the rune. In the same moment, the rune burst open like fire, dissipating on Benjamin's body. After that, a wetness began to spread out. Even the heavy, deathly aura in the forest seemed to be suppressed immediately.</p><br/><p>Benjamin spoke, spitting out a string of odd syllables. A wave of oscillation rippled out, and immediately after that, within a thirty meter radius from his body, numerous triangular runes appeared. They looked like a piece of mysterious and magnificent technique. Through the watery waves, the mages could vaguely be seen. Stunned.</p><br/><p>\"The Director\u2026 Has grown stronger again.\"</p><br/><p>Lara came back to her senses, and could not help but exclaim in astonishment.</p><br/><p>Only, they were all feeling somewhat doubtful. What was Benjamin planning to do? Was he able to face against these three magic-immune revenants just by using this technique?</p><br/><p>As they watched, the three revenants were immediately plunged into the deep sea domain, due to Benjamin's proximity with them. The thick waves of water covered their bodies, and in that same moment, they began to shake violently.</p><br/><p>The mages could sense horrifyingly tremendous amounts of water elements surging upon the bodies of the revenants, rushing into their rotting flesh and bones. Of course, these elements were finally deconstructed by a strange energy, turning into a frightening aura of death and making the bodies of the revenants grow stronger.</p><br/><p>After just a while, grey vapor, visible to the naked eye, began to rise from the three revenants.</p><br/><p>However\u2026</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>The revenant that had been shaking the most violently suddenly exploded into a pile of blood. Pieces of bone flew out in all directions, and were blocked by Benjamin, who had already been prepared with a ring of water film.</p><br/><p>Right after that, as though some switch had been activated, the other two bodies exploded as well, one after the other. They were like fireworks made out of rotting flesh; it was abnormally terrifying, and there was a burst of awful stench in the air.</p><br/><p>The mages were shocked into a daze, and automatically held their noses. Someone even began to vomit on the spot.</p><br/><p>Even Miles was stunned at the side, speechless for a moment.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026 This\u2026\" The male mage looked alarmed and confused. After a long daze, he spoke hesitantly, \"Director, did you just\u2026 Stuff them to their deaths?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

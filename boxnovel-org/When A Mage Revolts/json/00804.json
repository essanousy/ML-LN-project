Benjamin could not spend too much time helping them to settle in, so the most help he could give was some dry rations and books on general knowledge.</p><br/><p>After that, he took the two siblings and the spoils he had obtained back to the academy.</p><br/><p>\"How has the latest research been? I\u2019ve brought some interesting things for you guys on my trip out this time.\"</p><br/><p>After entering through the doors, Benjamin did not even have time to drink a sip of water before hurrying over to the rune research department with the stone slates\u2014 the specialized academy that the small runic research group had grown into, and walked into the main laboratory.</p><br/><p>In the laboratory, hearing what Benjamin said, the mages stopped whatever they were doing, and surrounded Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"Heyo\u2026 Director, what work have you brought for us this time?\"</p><br/><p>An old, hunchback lady took off her gloves and walked over, asking helplessly. She was the newly-appointed head after the rune research department had been established, one of the earlier members of the small research group, mage Abby.</p><br/><p>Benjamin smiled and said nothing, but instead took out the stone slates from his bag, setting them out on the table.</p><br/><p>For a moment, the eyes of every mage on the scene flashed.</p><br/><p>\"This is\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"The newest rune research information,\" Benjamin said slowly, \"On it are runes that we have not yet discovered, and what\u2019s more important, is that there might be a pattern to their arrangements. These are invaluable to your research.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the mages who had come around him had on delighted and surprised expressions.</p><br/><p>Mage Abby picked up one of the stone slates, her old palm light skimming across the runes on top, saying: \"This thing\u2026 Has a history of at least three thousand years. The material itself is very special. If I am not mistaken, I\u2019m afraid this was made by refining one of the extinct elemental ores.\"</p><br/><p>\"You can recognize this material?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was somewhat surprised. He had not thought that someone would immediately have an inkling of the things he had just brought in.</p><br/><p>The material used to make the stone slates\u2026 They seemed grey and dull, looking not any different from an ordinary rock. Because of that, Benjamin and the System had not paid special attention to it, but rather, had focused on the runes.</p><br/><p>\"When you have lived long, naturally, you would have seen some strange things,\" Mage Abby played with the stone slates carefully, and was silent for a few moments before saying, \"The runes on them are also very special, a different system than that of the ones we knew before. I feel that the runes and the stone slates are integrated, and might possess some special effects.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin asked, \"Like a complete magical instrument?\"</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s right, this is possibly an extremely primitive model of a magical instrument or perhaps a totem? I am not so sure,\" Mage Abby explained, \"However, based on my limited understanding of this material, the content on these slates should be related to the spiritual energy of humans or creatures.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Benjamin could not help but nod, \"Yes\u2026 It is definitely tightly connected to spiritual energy.\"</p><br/><p>Psychic powers and the worshippers from across the sea were matters belonging to the academy as secrets, so there were only a few people that knew about them. It was also not good for him to explain the origin of the stone slate to every mage there.</p><br/><p>However, now that they mentioned spiritual energy\u2026</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought of something, and reached his hand into his bag, taking out a flashing stone.</p><br/><p>\"Look at this thing, please. Is the material the same as the stone slates?\"</p><br/><p>The moment the heart of souls was taken out, everyone on the scene could vaguely feel the huge amount of spiritual energy contained within it, and immediately looked astonished. Mage Abby hurriedly put down the stone slate and received it carefully, holding it in her hands.</p><br/><p>\"Heavens\u2026 Is this the crystallization of spirits? The legendary Heart of Souls?\"</p><br/><p>\"Legendary? What legend?\" Benjamin asked hurriedly.</p><br/><p>Mage Abby came back to her senses, and shook her head, saying, \"It\u2019s just a minor detail in the legend, perhaps only I, and very few others, have heard of it, so the reliability is not strong.\"</p><br/><p>\"It doesn\u2019t matter, please tell us,\" Benjamin asked interestedly.</p><br/><p>Mage Abby nodded, and put down the Heart of Souls, speaking slowly, \"This... Is something related to the chaotic era. At the time, humans have not yet received the power of magic, and magical creatures rampaged everywhere. To end all of that, Cain and Abel, the two brothers, prayed to the god of magic, and the god of light. Finally, the two gods responded. The brothers, using six hundred and sixty-six magical creatures that had just perished as a sacrifice, finally obtained, in exchange, the greatest power for human beings.\"</p><br/><p>\"As for the spirits of those six hundred and sixty-six magical creatures, they turned into a stone with a huge amount of spiritual energy condensed into it. The two brothers, using the stone, improved suddenly and exponentially in magic and psychic abilities, before finally driving away the magical creatures successfully, building a home that belonged to us humans.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Benjamin looked at the Heart of Souls as surprise and delight welled up in his heart.</p><br/><p>\"It can greatly increase the standard of the magic of people?\"</p><br/><p>\"...Not necessarily,\" Mage Abby, however, pursed her lips, putting on a cautious face, saying, \"In the legend I heard, the crystallization of the spirits not only contains great power but also had the coagulation of a frightening aura of grief. It is this aura of grief that finally led to the two brothers growing apart, destroying one another.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin furrowed his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>So fishy?</p><br/><p>\"You guys, research on these things first, if you have any results, let me know,\" Finally, he shook his head and said. This was originally research material for them, so even if the connections traced to these materials become slightly too big, Benjamin could not think of a better way to handle it.</p><br/><p>Mage Abby nodded and took the stone slates as well as the heart of souls.</p><br/><p>And so, Benjamin turned around, leaving the rune research department. However, what he had not expected was that, in the remote isle of the academy, Mage Abby had suddenly appeared again, and called to him in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\"...Director, may I have a word.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was somewhat startled, but seeing the serious look on the other party\u2019s face, he did not ask any further questions but followed Mage Abby into the even more remote path amongst the trees.</p><br/><p>Mage Abby took out the Heart of Souls and returned it into Benjamin\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\"Director, it is better that this remains with you,\" She explained with a grave face, \"The aura of grief in the legends aside, the spiritual energy in this thing is, indeed, absorbable by any ordinary mage, and has a terrible effect. The temptation of this thing is too great if it were to be placed in the research department, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\"</p><br/><p>She did not continue, but Benjamin already understood her point.</p><br/><p>But it was still\u2026 Slightly inappropriate.</p><br/><p>It was not to say that the mages in the rune research department were not worthy of his trust, it was just that it was best not to tempt human nature. To any mage, the allurement of increasing one\u2019s standard of power was extremely great.</p><br/><p>And so, Benjamin nodded and put the heart of souls into his pocket.</p><br/><p>\"But\u2026 Keeping it with me, this thing is unable to be of any use, isn\u2019t it a bit wasteful?\" After keeping it away, he gave it some thought, and could not help but ask.</p><br/><p>\"It is better to be wasteful than to create a disaster,\" Mage Abby said in a sincere and meaningful way, \"Sometimes, too great a power is not necessarily a good thing. I had a good friend when I was young, she was a mage with the most frightening talent. But\u2026 Her talent had brought about various troubles to her and had even almost ripped her spirit apart. At that time, she had no choice but to cut off a part of her power, or else, according to her, her will might have been drowned out by the power of another world, and vanish completely from this world.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Benjamin rubbed the back of his head.</p><br/><p>The story that she had just described\u2026 Why did it sound somewhat familiar?</p><br/><p>However, he did not think too much about it. The world was huge, and anything could happen. Mage Abby simply tended, like any other old person, to nag. Because of that, Benjamin did not mind so much.</p><br/><p>As for the usage of the Heart of Souls, he could slowly investigate it himself.</p><br/><p>And so, Benjamin bid goodbye to Mage Abby and ended this short and secret conversation, turning to leave.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

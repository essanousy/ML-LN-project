But for small cults like this, they definitely do not possess flawless logic in their teachings.</p><br/><p>In a sense, Benjamin may had defeated these two on a spiritual level.</p><br/><p>Although they grew up in a conservative religious environment, these two did not possess a strong devotion toward their cult\u2019s beliefs. They were merely influenced by society, followed their parents\u2019 faith and prayer. Their faiths were pure in their eyes, but also easily swayed. As soon as they encounter more intrusions from the outside world, it wouldn\u2019t take much to crush their spirits.</p><br/><p>Just like now\u2026 Benjamin did not know how to read people\u2019s minds, but based on the look on these two\u2019s faces, he could already tell that there were cracks in their faiths.</p><br/><p>As such, he struck at the opportunity.</p><br/><p>\"Have you guys ever thought about, how the lands, humans, seas, spiritual energy... came to exist?\" Benjamin said slowly, \"The reason why God created everything, was because humans from billions of years ago couldn\u2019t figure out how to explain it all. Along with their fear of the unknown, they forged these lies for their own self-assurance.\"</p><br/><p>\"No, it can\u2019t be, our Goddess\u2026 she truly exists....\"</p><br/><p>\"You speak that she exists, where\u2019s your proof?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, had you seen her true form? Did you hear her speaking to you? When you two were in peril, did she reached out to save you?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026...\"</p><br/><p>Both of their jaws dropped to the floor, no words came out of their mouths.</p><br/><p>Benjamin observed the situation at hand, decided that it\u2019s time to pull out the assassin\u2019s long mace. As such, he spoke to the System in his mind, \"Alright, conjure the thing you just mimicked moments ago.\"</p><br/><p>And with that, the System emitted a weak pulse of spiritual energy, then materialized it on Benjamin\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>The two sensed this, and stunned once again.</p><br/><p>\"This is\u2026...\"</p><br/><p>\"The unique structure your spiritual energy creates, it\u2019s likely you two see it as your Goddess\u2019s gift. But, after some research, and some tuning to the spiritual energy structure, I could effortlessly mimic it.\"</p><br/><p>The two listened, and couldn\u2019t help but shake their heads, despair can be clearly seen in their expressions.</p><br/><p>\"Impossible\u2026...\"</p><br/><p>\"The truth lies before you, how could it be impossible? Everything you knew were lies.\"</p><br/><p>\"No\u2026 our elder would not had deceived us\u2026 My parents had not perished, their souls lie deep within the depths of eternal serenity. They\u2019re\u2026 they\u2019re amazing people...\" The young girl seemed to be broken, and kept mumbling to herself.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the young boy spoke, cutting Benjamin off.</p><br/><p>\"...No.\"</p><br/><p>The young girl suddenly turned to him.</p><br/><p>\"Mom and dad\u2026 didn\u2019t die from fighting sea beasts for the sake of protecting our homeland.\" The young boy dipped his head, spoke shakily, \"After the funeral that day, I hid in that cave, and accidently picked up what the elders said\u2026 They said, mom and dad were executed because they had offended our Goddess...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin listened, his eyebrows rose up in response.</p><br/><p>Ha...\u2026 such was fate.</p><br/><p>A governing system whereby a God\u2019s will was absolute would establish various strict laws and unfairness. Right now however, two children which bare sins arrived before him, Benjamin definitely lucked out in this occasion.</p><br/><p>The secrets of the foreign cult, were destined to fall into his hands.</p><br/><p>\"How could this be? Why didn\u2019t you ever tell me?\" The young girl stared blankly for a while, her eyes suddenly widened, and shouted in a fit of rage.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2026 I didn\u2019t dare to.\" The young boy\u2019s voice tremble, \"If you knew, you would\u2019ve seek the elders. I do not wish for you to be branded with the sin of a traitor to the Goddess, and die without a trace...\"</p><br/><p>The young girl sat bewildered, and couldn\u2019t muster a single word.</p><br/><p>Looking at the agitated siblings, Benjamin shook his head, then spoke slowly.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t you guys understand? Your Goddess, was nothing but a lie forged by those people to control you. Why would you sell your souls for their cause?\"</p><br/><p>The young girl remained motionless, and just stared blankly, as if nothing else could ever matter. The young boy however had his head dipped still, lifeless as a statue.</p><br/><p>Benjamin observed the situation at hand, and rubbed his chin.</p><br/><p>He probably should give these two some time alone, so that they could turn around and utterly betray their beliefs, willingly reveal everything they know.</p><br/><p>Though forcing them to talk through rough means can be effective, but\u2026 how could it compare to having them talk willingly, to wholeheartedly reveal this entirely different spell system?</p><br/><p>Yet, at this instant, the young girl\u2019s body suddenly vibrated vigorously. Her vision turned red, agonizing rasping escaped her lips, huge patches of green veins surfaced on her skin, her face twisted into a rather horrifying sight.</p><br/><p>\"Sis\u2026 sis what\u2019s wrong? I...\" The young boy was shocked, hastily asked. Halfway through asking, he himself began to tremble, entering a state mirrored that of the young girl\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was caught by surprise as he raised his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>Was it the negative side effects from those potions? But\u2026 for the fatal side effects, he was sure that he removed them through his healing water sphere spell.</p><br/><p>\"Their bodies had another kind of potion taking effect.\" the System suddenly spoke, \"Some strange concoction, now converging in their brains, little by little their nerves are getting engulfed. Their brains however\u2026 not sure why, seem to have an intense burden on them, unable to withstand any of it.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin thought quickly, immediately opened his mouth, and asked the two siblings aloud, \"Before you two entered here, did you guys drink anything? Tell me now! Or else you\u2019re both gonna die!\"</p><br/><p>\"We\u2026 we drank the soul potion our elders gave us...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was appalled.</p><br/><p>So these two were sent here specially as sacrifices. Never would he imagined in the far off islands, that the heinous manipulation there would be this severe.</p><br/><p>What now?</p><br/><p>Benjamin could only hastily draw a rune, to cast Elemental Order - Heal.</p><br/><p>He had to try, no matter what potion they downed, it would\u2019ve affected their internal organs, then their spiritual energies. At the very least the healing from spells contained miraculous effects for treatment of the human body.</p><br/><p>As drizzle fell on them, their rasping suddenly grew louder. They were struggling in agonizing pain in their seats, the hysterical uproar was much more appalling than that of grisly tortures.</p><br/><p>\"This is...\" Benjamin was stunned.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t stop, your spell reactivated their senses.\" the System then said, \"The potion is engulfing their brains, but the life energy in the spell had revitalized their resistance, they\u2019re now battling against the potion.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then\u2026 they probably won\u2019t die?\"</p><br/><p>If there two died, Benjamin had no clue on how to dispel the spiritual energy shard embedded in the king\u2019s brain.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m not sure, I can tell however that the potion\u2019s effect is tremendous itself.\" The System couldn\u2019t help but reply.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

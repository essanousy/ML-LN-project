They looked toward those spies who were standing up and started to notice how suspicious they were.</p><br/><p>However, there were still people who were unwavering.</p><br/><p>\"If that\u2019s the case\u2026 Then we will attempt a Grenade of Holy Light.\" One of the spies put on a bold face and blurted.</p><br/><p>\"Alright then, please start.\"</p><br/><p>The situation was growing intense. These spies exchanged glances. Some of them were unwilling; it was quite obvious that not everyone had the determination to break their faith under such circumstances.</p><br/><p>The mages summoning the divine art was definitely contrary to the Church\u2019s teachings. The reason for them, as mages, coming forth as spies was to wash away their \"sins.\" If they attempted the Divine Art while undercover, wouldn\u2019t they be dwelling deeper in their sins? Hence, from their perspective, this was already becoming a paradox.</p><br/><p>Benjamin chanted the incantations of the Grenade of Holy Light, gesturing the spy in front to begin his summoning. However, this undercover mage was still caught in his hesitation and bit his tongue.</p><br/><p>Finally, in such a stalemate, it was the spies who couldn\u2019t take it and blew their cover.</p><br/><p>\"You bastard, I\u2019m going to kill you!\"</p><br/><p>It seemed that out of the spies sent by the Church, not all of them were exceptional in their EQ. Benjamin activated the water elemental domain and felt the pressure of a strong Spiritual Energy weighing down against their shoulders; in the end\u2026 there was one who couldn\u2019t take it.</p><br/><p>With a screeching roar, the undercover mage standing at the last row suddenly cast in rage, summoning a series of fireballs toward Benjamin.</p><br/><p>At that stage, the mages around had a eureka moment, while the rest of the spies had \"damn it\" written all over their faces.</p><br/><p>A series of fireball flew through the broad classroom. The further they launched, the smaller they became The moment they reached Benjamin, only tiny sparks were left. A huff from Benjamin and they were extinguished.</p><br/><p>\"Since the Church was gonna get with the undercover, why can\u2019t they send better-qualified ones?\" Benjamin yawned.</p><br/><p>He stared at one of the undercover mages who sprung away and suddenly extended his arm and lightly pointed. Streams of water current burst forth like a spider web mid-air, crawling onto the undercover mage and forming a water bubble, completely trapping him within.</p><br/><p>Everything happened too fast. That undercover mages did not even respond in time and was still casting the flight spell. He was then cut short by the water bubble\u2019s anti-magic effect, resulting him throwing up blood in shock from the repelled magic.</p><br/><p>The mages around all were in shock.</p><br/><p>\"What a quick casting speed. Did you notice what magic he used? Why can\u2019t I tell?\"</p><br/><p>\"I didn\u2019t. It could be related to the newly researched runes meditation method. I heard that learning that law would enable non-incantation casting\u2026\"</p><br/><p>For a moment, the mages couldn't help but discuss in low voices. The remaining undercover mages, on the other hand, were filled with despair.</p><br/><p>\"Do you have anything else to say for yourselves?\" Benjamin stared at them coldly, \"Don\u2019t even bother to explain. We have all noticed your earlier exchange of glances. Don\u2019t tell me now you don\u2019t know him.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026 You will all go to hell.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin smiled, \"Save us the trouble. After you.\"</p><br/><p>And so, the remaining spies couldn\u2019t retaliate as they were subdued by him and the other mages. They were bound with the anti-magic chains and locked in the town\u2019s newly built prison. Soon after, each of them underwent Benjamin\u2019s special interrogation and of course, spilled the beans on everything they knew.</p><br/><p>Benjamin obtained the intel of the Church from them and found out a few venues in the Kingdom of Helius where undercover mages were nurtured. He might have to make the trip once he has the chance.</p><br/><p>These ten over undercover mages were then persecuted to death in the square of Academy Town as a warning.</p><br/><p>This matter quickly spread at Benjamin\u2019s instruction and soon the people within the three nations were all aware. It served as a reminder to all mages \u2014 The Church was not yet defeated and they were still active. No one was to let their guard down.</p><br/><p>Hence, the Church became the headliner between mages. Everyone sharpen their vigilance. This was the purpose Benjamin revealed the spies under the public\u2019s watchful eye.</p><br/><p>Of course, his reputation reached new heights because of this.</p><br/><p>The hire of the branches was still ongoing. Benjamin was unsure if the Church would still send more men but it was to be a teacher! Any fellow with malevolous intent should not be allowed to come close to those younglings who were showing good promises entering the doors of magic. Just one rat\u2019s crap would be enough to ruin the futures of the apprentices.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Benjamin basically spent his time on this. All of them had to pass a test interview constructed by the teaches of the academy, in addition to a double-examination by him and the System in order to truly become a teacher of the branch campus.</p><br/><p>Other matters such as campus building trivialities, teacher training\u2026 Benjamin didn\u2019t want to bother others with these, so he took them upon himself to relieve the pressure on the lack of manpower.</p><br/><p>Truth be told, this was also a process to build up prestige in the hearts of newcomers.</p><br/><p>\"I heard that the director of the magic academy is young and youthful. I didn\u2019t think that he would actually give us a class. He really doesn\u2019t seem like the rumors.\"</p><br/><p>\"But, I have witnessed it the other day. His capabilities really are as in the rumors\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin already enjoyed a terrifying popularity and status. However, this image portrayed in the hearts of every mage was mostly mysterious and far away. His first-hand participation in various matters slowly evaporated this distance.</p><br/><p>In the midst of being occupied, two months had swiftly passed. The branch campuses were almost completed, all established in the nearby capital of the three nations and supervised by individual nation respectively. The mid-semester examination of the magic academy has just ended and all students basically surpassed the stage of apprenticeship and formally became mages. They could now start using the runes\u2019 law of meditation to cultivate.</p><br/><p>Truth be told, in these recent months, the runes\u2019 law of meditation has started to be practiced extensively in the academy.</p><br/><p>The runes research team had experimented for quite some time and confirmed that this law, apart from \"inclination on certain courses\", didn't have much side effect and could be used regularly. They had also revised some of the minor details on the meditation process to increase the effectiveness. It could be said that the runes\u2019 law of meditation had completed its first stage of a system.</p><br/><p>Hence, the courses for the next semester intake would naturally have an additional core course.</p><br/><p>The students of this semester expressed how fortunate they were.</p><br/><p>As for Benjamin, after he assisted with the building of the branches, he took a break. He then went on to search the overseas siblings that remained in Academy Town.</p><br/><p>\"How\u2019s staying in town doing for you?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin looked around this little house that was shared by the duo.</p><br/><p>\"Quite alright.\" The young lady took out a wine pot and poured a glass of beer in a calm demeanor. She seemed to have gotten used to the life here, \"Sir Mage, I have been practicing psychic power religiously. When are you planning to bring us back for revenge?\"</p><br/><p>\"Oh? I thought you said that you didn\u2019t want to return. Why the change of heart?\"</p><br/><p>\"We have thought a lot in the past few days.\" The young lady and man exchanged glances, \"Here... really is different from the island. The people here are nice, nice to us too. We hope to continue living her but\u2026 Mother and father\u2019s corpses are still on the island.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded, \"And you are not afraid of the island\u2019s elder?\"</p><br/><p>The duo shook their heads.</p><br/><p>\"Alright, with this determination, it wasn\u2019t in vain that I talked the King into sparing you,\" Benjamin smiled, \"However, it is not the time to explore abroad. I\u2019m here today to hand over a new assignment.\"</p><br/><p>The duo was perplexed.</p><br/><p>\"What assignment?\"</p><br/><p>\"To teach others about psychic powers.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

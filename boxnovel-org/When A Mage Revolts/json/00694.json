Of course, each psychic power required a differently-drawn rune; these runes were referred to as \"psychic enchantments\" by the foreign cult.</p><br/><p>Maybe it was a similar concept to incantations.</p><br/><p>Benjamin had never actually tried casting psychic powers before; however, he had already memorized the psychic enchantment to dispel of the Spiritual Energy fragment. At first glance, the string of characters looked even more difficult than Arabic. Benjamin really had no idea how they managed to come up with psychic powers.</p><br/><p>Benjamin then drew out the psychic enchantment in his mind.</p><br/><p>Ding!</p><br/><p>He had his eyes closed throughout the entire process, so he had no idea what happened in the Pure Blue World. But from what he can see, the psychic incantation that he drew in his mind lit up right after he completed it.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was stunned.</p><br/><p>Did it\u2026really work?</p><br/><p>He immediately opened his eyes to check. But instead of seeing the Pure Blue World in front of him, Benjamin realized that he was in a dark room. There was only a sliver of light, not enough to let him figure out his surroundings.</p><br/><p>Benjamin felt dread fill his heart.</p><br/><p>He activated his water elemental sensing technique\u2026 Sure enough, he was in the King\u2019s bedroom.</p><br/><p>\"Who goes there?!\"</p><br/><p>\"Ah! Help!\"</p><br/><p>A few seconds after Benjamin realized where he was, a shrill voice \u2013 like that of a high pitch horn \u2013 sounded throughout the room. The King was awake for some reason, as was the woman sleeping with him. They had awakened from their slumber to meet with Benjamin\u2019s gaze in the dark of their room, thus causing them to cry out so loudly.</p><br/><p>To avoid any more unwanted accidents, Benjamin immediately activated his water elemental domain to build a soundproof barrier around them, lest a bunch of soldiers suddenly enter the room with shouts of \"Protect the King!\"</p><br/><p>\"Your Majesty, please do not worry for it is I, Sir Benjamin.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin summoned a strong gale to force the both of them to keep quiet before identifying himself.</p><br/><p>The King\u2019s expression was one of bewilderment.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026 you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>With the sentence seemingly stuck in his throat, the King slowly composed himself. He lit up the oil lamp on his bedside table to cast some light on Benjamin. After confirming that it was indeed Benjamin in his room, the King seemed to be more at ease, though he was still shaking.</p><br/><p>\"Sir Benjamin, what do you think you\u2019re doing in my room in the middle of the night?\"</p><br/><p>The awkwardness was evident.</p><br/><p>Benjamin coughed dryly a few times before answering, \"\u2026Your Majesty, I am here to dispel the Spiritual Energy fragment in your brain.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019ve found a way of doing so?\" the King stared at him in awe for a brief moment, still slightly sluggish from his sleep.</p><br/><p>\"You could say that.\" Benjamin shrugged his shoulders and continued, \"I did a trial just now, but the results have not yet been confirmed.\"</p><br/><p>\"You did a trial just now?\"</p><br/><p>\"Yes, I did. How do you feel, Your Majesty?\"</p><br/><p>The King absentmindedly scratched his head and said, \"Just\u2026 just now I had a dream, it was as if I had fallen into the ocean where all I could see was blue water. There was also a weird yellow ball-like thing flying about. Then suddenly, I felt a strong force impact me, which caused me to awaken.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Noticing the shift in Benjamin\u2019s expression, the King immediately asked, \"Sir Benjamin, what is it? Does that mean that it has failed?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin swallowed his feeling of disharmony and shook his head, \"I\u2019ll have to check.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then\u2026 please hurry up and do so.\"</p><br/><p>The King was in his pajamas, so he left the bed quickly. Benjamin nodded his head and walked toward the King, getting ready to check. The woman on the bed was still covering herself with the blankets, her expression making her seem as though she saw Benjamin as a lunatic.</p><br/><p>\"Come on. You should check the Majesty\u2019s condition.\" Benjamin did his best to ignore the obviously awkward situation and called on the System in his mind.</p><br/><p>\"What do you mean I should check? Did you enter the elemental plane just now? What happened in there?\" The System\u2019s confusion was obvious, which once again proved that none of what had happened in the elemental plane was recorded in its database.</p><br/><p>\"That doesn\u2019t matter. Just do the check quickly; I don\u2019t want to be here any longer.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright\u2026\"</p><br/><p>The System was quiet for a while before it answered once again, surprised this time, \"The Spiritual Energy fragment in his brain is really gone. How did you do it?\"</p><br/><p>\"As long as you stop using that mentally handicapped tone to speak, I\u2019ll tell you.\"</p><br/><p>\"\u2026 \"</p><br/><p>Benjamin heaved a sigh and returned his gaze to reality once more. In the room, the King had just seen Benjamin sigh and was prepared for the worst, his tone shifted to one of nervousness.</p><br/><p>\"Sir Benjamin, I\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2019re okay.\" Benjamin interrupted the King and said with a smile, \"Your Majesty, the Spiritual Energy fragment in your brain is gone. After this, as long as you remain wary of others and do not allow any priests from foreign cults to mingle with high-level officials, nothing else will happen.\"</p><br/><p>The King heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\"That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s good.\"</p><br/><p>With that, Benjamin turned and left the King\u2019s bedroom immediately. He returned to his own room and closed the door, collapsing on the bed.</p><br/><p>This whole fiasco caused by the foreign cult seems to have finally ended.</p><br/><p>The next morning, he could finally return to the Academy. While Benjamin had been preoccupied here, the launching of the branch campus was in full swing. Although Varys had been constantly updating him, the matter regarding the infiltration of the spies of the church into the Academy still had to be settled as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Other than that, all that was left was the matter of the foreign cult itself\u2026</p><br/><p>While Benjamin was lost in his thoughts, he suddenly realized the presence of two thin silhouettes in his room.</p><br/><p>\"\u2026 Why are you two in my room?\"</p><br/><p>Turns out the teenaged boy and girl from the foreign cult were kneeling in the corner of his room. They stood up and looked at him timidly.</p><br/><p>The entire situation was strange, and Benjamin felt his skin crawl. If he had not recognised them earlier and had attacked them immediately, they would\u2019ve been dead by now.</p><br/><p>What was happening? Although he had untied them both, if he remembered correctly, he had definitely locked the door before he left.</p><br/><p>Under Benjamin\u2019s judgemental gaze, the teenaged girl finally spoke, \"Sir Benjamin, we are\u2026 we are here to thank you.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s eyebrows raised in curiosity.</p><br/><p>\"The only reason I saved to two of you was because if you two were dead, I might not have been able to get rid of the Spiritual Energy fragment in the King\u2019s brain.\" Benjamin pursed his lips and continued, \"I tied you both to chairs and interrogated you both fiercely, don\u2019t you hate me?\"</p><br/><p>The teenage girl was quiet for a moment before she answered, \"But\u2026 you didn\u2019t actually subject us to any torture.\"</p><br/><p>Hmm\u2026 that was true.</p><br/><p>After all they were both just a couple of thirteen, maybe fourteen-year-olds; Benjamin really didn\u2019t have it in him to be too harsh on them. However, he was not going to actually tell them that.</p><br/><p>\"Then, how are you both planning on thanking me?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

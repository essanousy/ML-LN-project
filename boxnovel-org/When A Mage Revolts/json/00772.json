Numerous Mages stood on both sides of the soldiers, they had a determined look on their faces, it was as though they were cheetahs ready to hunt after its prey.</p><br/><p>Nearly all the forces of the Rock City were gathered here.</p><br/><p>Benjamin glanced at the bare night sky, suddenly turned around and nodded at the guards on both sides of the gate.</p><br/><p>Half an hour ago, he sent Miles and a few mages to bring the key, disguise themselves as him, and leave Rock City. When they flew relatively far enough, Benjamin will disable the anti-magic water ball that were shielding the keys, so that Grant detected the specially treated gingko leaf.</p><br/><p>The System detected that a powerful holy energy flew over Rock City, and went towards the direction of the key.</p><br/><p>Therefore... it was time.</p><br/><p>\"Open the door.\"</p><br/><p>After hearing that, the guards immediately moved forward and carefully removed the latch sealing the west gate. Subsequently, the gate that withstood the multiple impacts of the wood battering ram opened slowly at that moment.</p><br/><p>At the same time, along with a burst of magical fluctuations, the rune\u2019s defense shield that was shielding the country disappeared.</p><br/><p>\"Let\u2019s go, the Pope has been lured away, so it is time for us to fight back.\" Benjamin\u2019s voice was not loud, it sounded very calm and under the influence of magic, everyone's heart shook.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the leader of the army raised his arm, and swung it down!</p><br/><p>\"GO--!\"</p><br/><p>About ten thousands of people roared and broke the silence of the night. The soldiers who were under suppression rushed forward like beasts, they stormed through the piles of corpses outside the city and charged towards the Kingdom of Helius\u2019 stronghold in the distance. Their footsteps were like torrents and the ground was shaking.</p><br/><p>The mages flew directly over the city wall, and the group of mages looked like dark clouds in the sky which significates death while they shrouded towards their enemy.</p><br/><p>\"Wa-wait! What happened?\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, the guards at the Kingdom of Helius\u2019s sentry post were stunned. The guards looked at the magnificent army coming out from Rock City, and instinctively rubbed their eyes, some of them thought that they were hallucinating.</p><br/><p>Were... were they imagining things?</p><br/><p>\"Quick... where is the cap-captain? Quickly inform the Pope that there is an attack!\" The guard with the fastest reaction quickly recovered from the shock, immediately turned around and shouted with all his might.</p><br/><p>They did not expect what their captain had just said would come true.</p><br/><p>However, what was even more unbelievable was that when their captain climbed up to the sentry post and he had and indescribable look on his face. He turned his head toward the army of Icor and his lips started shaking.</p><br/><p>\"Cap-captain, what happened? What did the Pope say? Say... say something!\" The guards at the side were getting even more anxious, they quickly grabbed his shoulder and asked.</p><br/><p>The captain came back to his senses and there was a hopeless look on his face: \"The Pope... he- he\u2019s not here.\"</p><br/><p>\"He\u2019s not here? What do you mean by that?\" The guards were shocked. \"Didn\u2019t you just report to the Pope? How can the Pope be gone?\"</p><br/><p>\"His Majesty... how would I know? He\u2019s not here!\" The captain covered his face and roared hysterically, as if he was having a mental breakdown.</p><br/><p>The guards were puzzled while they looked at each other, however, they instinctively rang the alarm bell hanging on the sentry post.</p><br/><p>Dong--!</p><br/><p>The soldiers of the Kingdom of Helius were awakened by the bell, rose up from their sleep, hurriedly put on their armor, rushed out of their camps and stood at their base while they looked around without a clue. The priests and bishops supervising the camp also hurriedly woke up, and they had an astounded look on their faces.</p><br/><p>\"An attack? How is that possible? How could they leave their turtle shell?\"</p><br/><p>\"Do not panic, we still have the bishops here with us, they are just going to die here! Where\u2019s the Pope? Wait... did anyone see the Pope?\"</p><br/><p>The camp was very noisy and everyone wanted to find Grant. However, when they barged into the Pope's private tent, only an empty seat was there.</p><br/><p>The Pope... disappeared.</p><br/><p>When they saw this, the bishops\u2019 and priests\u2019 mind was a mess, and the news was like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky.</p><br/><p>\"Why is the Pope missing?\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was asking this question; but no one had the answer to it. In such a panicked state, a bishop took out the God\u2019s Eye and tried to get into contact with Grant. However, the reply they got from the flashing bead in his hands was a message which stated that the Pope was busy and he did not have time to talk to them.</p><br/><p>At that moment, everyone was frozen still, they were pale and were sweating profusely.</p><br/><p>At the same time, there was a bad feeling in their heart.</p><br/><p>\"... This must have been the mages evil plan.\" An elderly bishop calmed down as soon he could, and hurriedly said. \"We cannot be alarmed. The Pope should be able to quickly discover their plan and rush back to settle this. Before that, we must defend against the enemy\u2019s attack, we cannot let their evil plan succeed!\"</p><br/><p>The priests around heard this and nodded. They took a few deep breaths and did their best to calm down.</p><br/><p>However, at that moment, they heard the screams of the guards coming from outside of the camp. The murderous sound reached their ears, and the faces of the bishops and priests in the camp who had just calmed down started to waver.</p><br/><p>They were frozen still, and could not help but to look outside.</p><br/><p>\"The enemy... The enemy is coming! There are so many of them... Soldiers, mages... Where is the Pope?\" Suddenly, several soldiers barged into camp with blood on their shoulders and shouted with a voice with despair and sorrow.</p><br/><p>\"The Pope is not here for the time being, but... he will be back soon.\" The elderly bishop tried to remain calm and said with a mild, encouraging voice.</p><br/><p>However, when the soldiers heard that, they had an unhappy look on their faces.</p><br/><p>\"W-why would he...\"</p><br/><p>There were doubts and anger in their voices, and they looked as if they wanted to ask questions which they knew there were no answer to, just to vent the feeling of despair in their heart. Unfortunately, it seemed like they will not have the chance to do so.</p><br/><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><br/><p>A few ice blades flew into the tent through the door and pierced through the hearts of a few soldiers. They fell onto the ground in front of the priests and bishops with a furious looks on their faces.</p><br/><p>Subsequently, in the midst of the chaotic killing, Benjamin and several mages flew into the tent.</p><br/><p>\"Well... this should be Grant's tent.\" He looked around, nodded, and finally fixed his gaze on the bishops and priests in the tent, \"There are a few more shivering priests ... what are you hiding here? What is the point in hiding here? At least put in some effort to hide a little better.\"</p><br/><p>They did not speak, they were frozen still while they stared at Benjamin with fear and hatred.</p><br/><p>Benjamin saw this, shook his head and waved at the mages behind him.</p><br/><p>\"There is no use in hiding here, settle them.\"</p><br/><p>The mages nodded and started gathering elements in their hands. In the eyes of the bishops and priests, it looked as though it was despair that was gathering in the mages\u2019 hands.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He did not have additional spiritual energy to attack them. That being said, he wasn\u2019t too worried about the enemy\u2019s magic attacks.</p><br/><p>Every point of the ice barricade was packed with countless tiny ice cubes, compressed to the point they were like steel. It would be a huge shock if they were able to break though.</p><br/><p>Not to mention, the air was filled with refined crushed ice</p><br/><p>By now, all the guards had all been frozen to death - no one was spared. Even the solid ground was starting to freeze over. The merchants that hid within the protection of the elemental shield started to have chills.</p><br/><p>\"Sir Mages, please figure something out!\" One of the merchants panicked as he felt that the shield could no longer hold off the cold, \"If this continues, we will freeze to death!\"</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the mages could not care less about them.</p><br/><p>Perhaps with their lives on the line, riches no longer mattered; they were not fighting for their employer but rather for their own lives. However, they were still compassionate enough to allow them to share refuge within the shield.</p><br/><p>\"Shut up.\" The mage coldly responded, \"One more word and I will toss all of you out.\"</p><br/><p>The merchants quickly quieted down. All traces of their earlier swagger were gone.</p><br/><p>With this, the remaining three mages completed their chant.</p><br/><p>The crazy surge of earth element caused the frozen ground to suddenly crack open. A beam of light poured out through the surface and three spears condensed by the earth elements rose out of the ground and appeared before them.</p><br/><p>In an instant, a powerful surge of magic oscillation spread outward and the merchants no longer felt any coldness.</p><br/><p>\"Spear of the Earth huh...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin stood on the outside and saw this. He raised his eyebrow with a curious expression.</p><br/><p>These people were smart. They did not attempt to use fire magic but instead chose earth that was still unrestricted. The Spear of the Earth was an intermediate level magic that was used purely for attack. Its penetration was strong and was usually used to penetrate through an enemy\u2019s powerful shield. This would indeed be the best choice to try to break through the barrier.</p><br/><p>However, from this, Benjamin could estimate his opponents\u2019 level.</p><br/><p>He smiled coldly while shaking his head.</p><br/><p>If their limit was intermediate level magic, then they were as good as dead.</p><br/><p>After summoning three Spears of the Earth, the mages began to control individual spears to strike against the ice wall.</p><br/><p>The merchants understood the meaning of this attack and became nervous. They held their breath as they watched on.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the spears collided with the wall.</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>Like the Titanic ramming into the iceberg, Benjamin felt a huge tremor as he stood at the peak of the giant icy grave. His Spiritual Energy dropped, and he started seeing stars.</p><br/><p>He lost his balance and almost fell from the surface.</p><br/><p>After the initial shock, Benjamin took a deep breath to calm his nerves.</p><br/><p>Interesting...</p><br/><p>The mages seemed to be well versed in earth magic. This hand of Spear of the Earth unleashed such amazing impact while under their control. This three-prong attack was no doubt the equivalent of advance level magic.</p><br/><p>Benjamin couldn't help but thank his lucky stars.</p><br/><p>If that fourth mage\u2019s incantation wasn\u2019t interrupted, the additional spear might have been just enough to pierce the barrier.</p><br/><p>Within the giant grave, after the dust and debris cleared, everybody looked on. The area that the spears were aimed at now had a shattered indent.</p><br/><p>The deep indent was like an ulcer on the ice wall. Although it did not penetrate, the indent provided hope to them that the possibility of escaping was very much achievable. The merchants were overcome with excitement.</p><br/><p>\"Quick! A few more times and it will break open the wall!\"</p><br/><p>Their cries of joy didn\u2019t last long as Benjamin stretched his arm toward the mark. With that, the refined powder started to condense at the area, and the indent reverted to its original state. It was perfectly smooth, without any signs of its previously sustained damage.</p><br/><p>Their joyousness quickly turned solemn.</p><br/><p>\"What the fuck\u2026 Don\u2019t tell me it can never be broken?\"</p><br/><p>The mages weren\u2019t in total despair. They glanced at one another before nodding and starting their incantation once again.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t all that surprised that the ice wall could be repaired. More importantly, it has been proven that they possessed the ability to destroy it. Previously they used three Spears of the Earth, but what about four? Could they break through then?</p><br/><p>After the initial test, they were quite certain that they were on the right track.</p><br/><p>The merchants no longer dared to speak. They were afraid that they might interrupt the mage\u2019s incantation. They held one another close, attempting to conserve body heat.</p><br/><p>\"Hey, shouldn\u2019t you do something?\" The System suddenly spoke up, \"You might not be able to defend against four Spears of the Earth. Even if you do, judging by their persistence, they would go repeat the cycle with even more spears. Can your spiritual energy hold out against theirs?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head and answered, \"No chance.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then should you be doing something about it?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin smiled and answered, \"It\u2019s alright, just watch and wait.\"</p><br/><p>In moments, the temperature in the icy grave dropped once again. The shield and body heat started to fail the merchants as their strength started to falter. The four mages started to shiver but their strong wills kept them going long enough to finish this round of incantations. The surface of the ground once again cracked open and four Spears of the Earth appeared, with an even stronger magic oscillation interference.</p><br/><p>\"Quick... Break the wall...\" One of the merchants coughed out.</p><br/><p>The mages\u2019 eyes shimmered with firmness. They launched the spears as hard as they could at the wall.</p><br/><p>Only this time, it did not create such a loud noise.</p><br/><p>Just as the four spears were about to collide with the ice barricade, the ice wall opened up like a living being. The spears flew through the hole and disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>The hole then closed and the whole returned to its original shape.</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>Everyone was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>The mages\u2019 eyes widened as they starred at the smooth solid hard wall. They were absolutely speechless. The merchants who were still conscious rubbed their eyes and looked at one another. It was like they were hallucinating.</p><br/><p>How could the spears just\u2026 disappear?</p><br/><p>Unlike the merchants, the four mages understood what was going on. But they were really hoping that they were wrong.</p><br/><p>They could overlook the fact that they did not sense any magic oscillation. But from the earlier scene, they felt an unimaginable amount of control over magic. They did not know their opponent but to them it seemed that he was a god \u2013 the shit that he just pulled should not have been possible.</p><br/><p>Is this still even magic?</p><br/><p>Within the giant icy grave, it was pin-drop silence.</p><br/><p>\"Have you played around enough?\" Benjamin broke the silence, \"I have already said that this will be your grave.\"</p><br/><p>As he said this, the elemental shield that was protecting them finally cracked, exposing everyone inside to the extreme cold.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s over.\" Benjamin whispered.</p><br/><p>The bonfire extinguished as the grave was plunged into total darkness.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

You carry within your body an energy that does not belong to you, and have brought it into the forbidden zone of the dead. You will become the anathema of all undead, and will never attain peace, even in the afterlife.\"</p><br/><p>Although his voice was still steady and haughty, Benjamin could sense the fury hidden within.</p><br/><p>\"What's the difference? As long as the undead see a living being, don't they want to kill it, regardless of who it is?\" Benjamin gave a cold scoff, asking through his spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>Saying thus, he controlled the runes and gathered the energy of the elemental order together, focusing it onto the bone dragon.</p><br/><p>The pattering drizzle immediately covered the gigantic body of the bone dragon. Every drop of water contained an abundance of life force, and when they were compressed together, the aura of death around the bone dragon's body was immediately suppressed. The force field that had been able to destroy elements was beginning to dissolve under the effects of the healing drizzle.</p><br/><p>\"It can still be done this way\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Even the few mages in the water bubbles could clearly feel the change in the bone dragon's aura. The male mage had a stunned expression. He was not only surprised that healing magic could fight the undead, this was also his first time seeing Benjamin cast healing magic.</p><br/><p>They followed suit, tossing some Water of Life towards the bone dragon. However, their magic was broken against the body of the bone dragon, and were not in the least bit useful, destroyed by that force field.</p><br/><p>Because of that, they realized just how amazing the healing magic cast by Benjamin was.</p><br/><p>\"Even if your legs get chopped off, could you stick them back on as long as the rain falls on you?\" Someone could not help but ask.</p><br/><p>There was nothing more they could do as things have gotten to this stage. They could only hide out obediently in the water bubble and spectate the battle. Following the accumulation of water elements, the rain grew heavier and heavier, until finally, the force field around the bone dragon's body had been weakened to a thin layer.</p><br/><p>Sizzle!</p><br/><p>A drop of water passed through the force field, and fell upon the spine of the bone dragon. Like strong acid falling upon a human's face, it immediately produced an obvious corrosive effect.</p><br/><p>Of course, the water droplet rapidly evaporated into nothing; not a hint of element was left. However, a bright, brown spot appeared on the spine that had been \"healed\".</p><br/><p>\"Roar!\"</p><br/><p>The bone dragon lashed its body about, roaring in pain.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the greyish white flames nearby had already dissipated completely. After the roar, the black smoke suddenly changed their directions and surged towards the bone dragon. At the same time, the earth, filled with white bones, began to shake once more, as though there was something else underground moving.</p><br/><p>The expressions of the mages changed slightly.</p><br/><p>When the bone dragon was being suppressed, they had thought Benjamin had turned the tables in the battle. However\u2026 Right now, there still seemed to be some changes to come.</p><br/><p>A vast draft of black smoke gathered around the body of the bone dragon, and instantly repaired the force field, blocking the corrosion of the rain. Wave after wave of earthquake came in quick succession, and the white bones all over the land suddenly floated into the air, drifting about like spirits.</p><br/><p>It seemed that something was about to happen\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Quickly! Tie Miles up to the wooden board!\" Suddenly, Benjamin cleared out the deep sea domain and the water bubble, turning his head to shout at the mages.</p><br/><p>The mages were startled, and immediately responded. Lara bound all the luggage together using magic, and the other mages took out the wooden boards that they had used to bring Miles into flight, running to Miles and carefully placing the wooden boards under his body.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Miles had completely lost consciousness. The magic immunity force field that had originally been around his body seemed to have become very strange. The mages did not come close, but carefully pushed the wooden boards under his body, and turned around, casting their spells and flying into the sky.</p><br/><p>Benjamin summoned a huge area of water vapor to lift the wooden boards up, rising into the air with them.</p><br/><p>\"Let's go!\"</p><br/><p>He did not waste time on nonsense. With a wave of his hand, he turned around and brought Miles and the other mages, zooming towards the south furiously. The healing drizzle behind him wafted around even more violently, and rushed straight onto the roaring bone dragon.</p><br/><p>If it were moments ago, he still had thoughts of retaliation in his heart. Right now, however, the only thing on his mind was escape.</p><br/><p>Because when the earth began to shake again, an instinctive alarm had suddenly surged up in his subconsciousness, causing him to break into cold sweat immediately.</p><br/><p>It was an alert from the elemental plane.</p><br/><p>\"Don't try to challenge the law. Your actions now are very dangerous.\"</p><br/><p>Although Benjamin did not know what law it was, but he was clear that the alert planted by the organisms from the higher dimensions would only ring when his reckless behavior could affect the entire plane. Also, after the black smoke had surged into the bone dragon, the situation of the battle had begun to not look so good.</p><br/><p>They really had to run now!</p><br/><p>Under the black skies of the netherworld, their figures flashed by, flying speedily towards the south. At the same time, the earth continued to shake, and a frightening growling sounded from behind them, as though a living dragon was roaring in anger.</p><br/><p>Benjamin glanced behind him.</p><br/><p>He could see that huge amounts of black smoke had gathered within the two wings of the bone dragon, and the bone wings were becoming darker and darker. After that, the bone dragon leapt from the ground, its wings moving. Just like that, its gigantic body rose into the air.</p><br/><p>Following the shaking of the earth and the floating white bones, even more black smoke had been emitted from within its frame of bones. The soul fires in its eye sockets turned pitch black, fixed upon Benjamin, who was flying further and further away.</p><br/><p>\"Sinners must be punished.\"</p><br/><p>The voice of the soul of bones rang straight into his heart.</p><br/><p>Benjamin's heart sank, and immediately formed a curtain of rain in the air by controlling the runes, wanting to block the bone dragon. However, the bone dragon continued to accelerate, and crashed headlong into the curtain of rain.</p><br/><p>Sizzle\u2026 The sound rang out into an area of a hundred miles. It was as though the corpse of a gigantic dragon had been thrown into a cauldron of oil the size of a lake. The curtain of rain was extremely corrosive to the bone dragon. However, this time, the bone dragon was not suppressed by the curtain of rain. Instead, it flapped its wings, and in just a short while, emerged from the curtain of rain.</p><br/><p>\"Motherf*cker\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Seeing that, Benjamin swore in his heart, and sped up a little.</p><br/><p>\"You are in huge trouble now!\" The System was complaining non-stop. \"Don't think about fighting it anymore, right this moment, the energy of the entire netherworld is gathering upon that bone dragon! You've not just angered some soul of bones, you've angered the entire netherworld!\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Benjamin could not help but shoot a question back at it, as he escaped, \"What horrible, immoral thing have I done that the entire world is going against me now?\"</p><br/><p>\"I don't know, but\u2026 The living should not have been allowed in here.\"</p><br/><p>\"We've entered so many times before, why was it okay back then? Why is it only now that a bone dragon has come out to tell me there's some shit law?\"</p><br/><p>\"Who asked you to be so high profile?!\" The System said, fuming. \"Smuggling is illegal, so other people are careful after smuggling. Unlike you, running off to another world, yet you just have to beat your drum and set off fireworks. Who else can they fight, if not you?\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin had nothing to say to that.</p><br/><p>Whatever it was, the bone dragon behind him seemed hell-bent on wanting to chase and kill him. There was no point talking about this anymore. He calmed down, and turned his head once more, calculating the bone dragon's speed of flight.</p><br/><p>If there was really no way of shaking him off, then they would have to think of some other way\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Come back!\"</p><br/><p>He immediately sent a command to his mind. The sprite, who was no longer keen on fighting after being thrown off, flapped its wings and shakily maintained its balance, before darting back to Benjamin's side.</p><br/><p>With a flash of blue light, it rushed into the space of consciousness. It was obvious that it had lost its fighting ability.</p><br/><p>Benjamin lifted his head and looked to the bone dragon, his eyes meeting the pair of cold soul fires within the eye sockets.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

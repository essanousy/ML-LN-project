Every bone joint was clear, and in the midst of the yellowing, mottled bones was an extremely ancient aura. Like the liches, its soul fires burned within its skull, and together with jaws lined with sharp fangs, it looked fierce and abnormal. A pair of bony wings emerged from its humongous spine, flapping steadily, as it swept its long tail about\u2026 The bone dragon's huge and magnificent body was crouched down low against the ground, and with every step it took, footprints at least half a meter deep were left.</p><br/><p>Thus, this epic monster that existed only in legends, never before witnessed by mankind, appeared before them, \"live\" before their eyes.</p><br/><p>Benjamin could not help but draw in a sharp, cold breath.</p><br/><p>\"So\u2026 Dragons really exist in this world?\"</p><br/><p>The System was silent for a few seconds, before speaking suddenly, \"Actually, they do not exist. According to some ancient records, such a creature should have been extinct a long time ago. What you see now is only a carcass.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin put his palms over his face, speechless.</p><br/><p>Of course he knew this was a carcass! The point was that\u2026 If a carcass could move, had its own consciousness and could swallow up a human whole, then what damn difference did it make if it were or were not a carcass?</p><br/><p>No matter what, the situation now was quite bad. His negotiations with the \"Soul of Bones\" had broken down, and so the other being had fished his bone dragon body out for them to take a good look. Benjamin did not even know if he could beat this bone dragon.</p><br/><p>\"Director\u2026 What should we do?\" The male mage turned his head, asking in utter surprise.</p><br/><p>Benjamin took a deep breath, saying, \"You lot, test it out first.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the mages nodded and summoned a few shadow arrows before firing them towards the bone dragon. With a few swooshing sounds, the arrows hit the creature's frontal bone. In an instant, they were swallowed up by a force field not unlike those of the liches. The dark elements were destroyed completely, converting into the aura of death wafting around its body.</p><br/><p>Luckily, this was only a trial attack. There were not many elements, so the bone dragon was not strengthened too much.</p><br/><p>However, seeing this, the hearts of Benjamin and the mages sank.</p><br/><p>\"Another thing that's totally unafraid of magic.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin's forehead was scrunched up.</p><br/><p>He had finally realized that this land of the undead was simply full of malice towards mages. In addition to the rotten and stinking fish and prawns on the outer fringes, the deeper it is, the more powerful magic-immune abilities the undead creatures would have. There was absolutely nothing to work with here.</p><br/><p>This was not a place for mages.</p><br/><p>\"Director, sir, could you move this runic elemental barrier?\" Lara asked hurriedly, before the bone dragon reached them.</p><br/><p>Benjamin knew the reason for her question, and sighed, saying, \"...I can, but it would be very slow. We definitely would not be able to outrun the enemy.\"</p><br/><p>The black smoke around them had not dissipated. It remained, covering them up tightly. If it were not for the barrier condensed by the elemental technique - defense, and all they had were the typical magical shields, they would have been engulfed completely by the black smoke even before they could lay their eyes on the bone dragon. However, the disadvantage of using the elemental technique was that it was difficult to control. Wrapped up inside, it would be very difficult for them to escape from the black smoke.</p><br/><p>To rush into the black smoke with their flesh exposed? Benjamin did not know what would happen, but he was certain that it would not be good.</p><br/><p>\"Then\u2026 We can't run, we can't fight. Are we going to die here?\" The male mage looked despondent, and asked as he watched the bone dragon advance closer.</p><br/><p>\"What are you worried about? As long as I'm alive, you lot won't die.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin's face was cold. He waved his hands to once again summon the water elemental sprite from his space of consciousness.</p><br/><p>From the conversation he had with the soul of bones just now, the water elemental sprite seemed to have incited the disgust of the creature. Thus, perhaps only this thing could inflict any significant harm upon this bone dragon.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the bone dragon had reached the external side of the barrier, and with an ear-splitting roar, it lifted its left front claws, as though it was about to destroy the last protection these humans had with one fell swoop.</p><br/><p>Benjamin immediately issued a command through the spiritual connection.</p><br/><p>\"Sprite, stop it!\"</p><br/><p>The water elemental sprite flapped its wings and rushed speedily towards the bone dragon. From the moment it had been summoned, it had seemed somewhat vicious, and Benjamin had even felt some of the excitement through the spiritual connection.</p><br/><p>Whoosh!</p><br/><p>A beam of limited water silk shot out from the sprite's hands, landing a direct hit on the bone dragon's left front claws. At that moment, the claws, raised up high, trembled. The mages saw hope.</p><br/><p>However, in the next moment, the trembling front claws suddenly regained stability, and swung violently towards the elemental barrier formed by runes!</p><br/><p>There was a crack, similar to the sound of scraping between sharp metals. It was extremely uncomfortable to hear. In an instant, the front claws of the bone dragons bounced off violently from the elemental barrier, but the barrier itself had had a huge hole clawed into it!</p><br/><p>Within a short few seconds, the thick undead aura surged through the big gap. Benjamin and the mages felt as though a huge rock was pressing onto their lungs, and immediately felt somewhat suffocated.</p><br/><p>F*ck!</p><br/><p>Benjamin hurriedly pulled out a few water elemental crystals and threw them into the gap. Before the bone dragon could make its next move, he controlled the runes to disperse the crystals immediately, turning them into huge pieces of activated, smart water elements.</p><br/><p>The huge hole in the barrier was instantly mended, trying once again to keep the black smoke out.</p><br/><p>Cold sweat had broken out over Benjamin's forehead, however.</p><br/><p>Almost\u2026 They had almost been killed. With just one swipe, this fellow had broken the defenses of the elemental technique. Was it that powerful?</p><br/><p>The other mages also had on shocked and hesitant expressions. They had just brushed against death. Standing rooted to the ground, they even forgot what they were supposed to be doing. Their backs were drenched in cold sweat.</p><br/><p>\"Roar!\"</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, the bone dragon was somewhat dissatisfied that it had not managed to destroy the enemy in one swoop. It withdrew its claws and, watching the water elemental sprite darting about inside the barrier, suddenly opened up its jaws!</p><br/><p>A huge blaze of ashen white fire shot towards the elemental barrier, like a flood bursting from a broken dam!</p><br/><p>At that moment, Benjamin's mood sunk to the bottom of the valley.</p><br/><p>As fast as he could, he drew a triangular rune, and the water elemental sprite collided into it, activating the deep sea domain. The runes, scattered like stars in the skies, were spread out. At the same time, he did not forget to create a few water bubbles for the mages and Miles, who had fallen unconscious at this point. He had to ensure that they would not be \"drowned\" by the overflow of water elements.</p><br/><p>As he completed all of that, the sea of ashen white fire had burnt the elemental barrier into nothing. The fire, mixed with the black smoke, waged a battle against the tides of water elements inside the deep sea domain.</p><br/><p>It seemed that the black smoke and the greyish white flames were the natural nemesis of the elements.</p><br/><p>Even though the elements within the deep sea domain were frighteningly high, temporarily keeping the two things out, the flames still drifted in, bit by bit.</p><br/><p>Some of the fire was slowly floating towards the water bubble protecting the mages\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

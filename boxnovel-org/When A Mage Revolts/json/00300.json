He threw everything to block as much as possible. As for himself, he controlled the steam to help him back away as fast as possible.</p><br/><p>He hoped that his spells could trigger a good amount of the small balls. However, the old man did not let him do as he pleased. He simply detonated one of the small balls to totally obliterate the Ice Wall and Water Shield. With just one detonation, he had gotten rid of all of Benjamin\u2019s protective spells.</p><br/><p>As for the remaining balls, they were still aimed at Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"Shit...\" Benjamin could not help but curse.</p><br/><p>He flew in the air and attempted to dodge the small balls by sharply changing course. But, the old man controlled the small energy balls well and they tracked his movements exactly. Eventually they were going to catch up with him.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was on the defensive. He had to dodge the balls whilst simultaneously throwing out spells to cancel out the effect of their explosions.</p><br/><p>Throughout this, the old man\u2019s body that was cut in half also started to join back together. There was some weird tissue at the wound, slowly sticking the body back together.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing this, Lance leapt to slice at the old again. However, this time around, the old man did not even pay him any attention. The shapeless, small energy balls stayed on Benjamin\u2019s tail, slowly closing in on him.</p><br/><p>During this cat-and-mouse, the distance between the balls and him slowly decreased.</p><br/><p>Benjamin felt a little short of breath.</p><br/><p>Casting spells continuously could cancel out the effect of some of the balls, but his casting was relatively slow. If this went on, he would eventually get hit!</p><br/><p>He shuddered to think what would happen then.</p><br/><p>Moreover, even if he could survive the explosion of the first wave of energy balls, what would happen afterwards? The old man would unleash another attack and he would have to run away \u2013 but, doing so moments after he had lost his Spiritual Energy and combat effectiveness? Impossible.</p><br/><p>If he remained defensive much longer, it would mean his death!</p><br/><p>If he did not want to be taken out, he had to take out his opponent.</p><br/><p>He noticed the process in which Lance attacked the old man. No matter how many parts the old man was cut into, even if he was diced like ground onions and garlic, the attacks did him no harm. He could still simultaneously control the small energy balls and re-join his separated body parts back together.</p><br/><p>For fuck sake was this guy an immortal? A normal immortal would at least be interrupted and forced to cast some spells after being cut off in pieces, right?</p><br/><p>Benjamin felt like he was going nuts. He had to find the old man\u2019s weakness.</p><br/><p>He had no choice. Seeing that the small balls were going to catch up with him, Benjamin decided to take drastic action. Suddenly, he once again changed his flying directions.</p><br/><p>Whilst doing so, he utilized the Icebreaking Spell to create a model that looked like a rocket with a sharp tip beside him. His whole being hid inside the Ice \"Rocket\" before it started to rapidly speed up - straight towards the old man.</p><br/><p>Their spells couldn\u2019t kill the old man, so he planned to misdirect the small energy balls at the old man and see if his own attacks could do the job.</p><br/><p>\"Hmph...\"</p><br/><p>However, upon seeing this situation, the old man simply snorted.</p><br/><p>The old man did not stop Benjamin. He simply let Benjamin ride the Ice Rocket straight through his already crumbling body. Immediately, blood gushed out. The old man was torn into dozens of pieces; he basically did not look even remotely human anymore.</p><br/><p>However, even in this creepy state, the old man could still speak. It is not known which organ he spoke from.</p><br/><p>\"Have you fooled around enough?\"</p><br/><p>With his ghastly words, the small energy balls flew to his front and obediently disappeared, leaving his unscathed. Following this, Benjamin suddenly felt a strange flow of energy around him.</p><br/><p>What the fuck? What is this?</p><br/><p>Benjamin was stunned and attempted to get further away from the old man. However, as he tried to move, he discovered that he was stuck, as if bounded by some invisible thing. He could not even speak!</p><br/><p>Immediately, Benjamin\u2019s expression darkened.</p><br/><p>Shit...</p><br/><p>He was trapped by the old man!</p><br/><p>He used the Non-Verbal Spell Casting technique and produced more steam to try to pull himself free. But the power that was holding him in place was much stronger than Glue 502. It trapped him firmly in place.</p><br/><p>It was difficult for him to blink, much less break free.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was devastated. Was the Second Form really so powerful?</p><br/><p>\"Interesting. Even in this situation, you can still use magic.\" The old man\u2019s voice rang from the broken pieces of his body. \"But, being able to use magic will not make much difference now. The Judgement of God has been passed down. This is a fate from which you cannot escape.\"</p><br/><p>As he spoke, a spear that was made of blood and flesh suddenly appeared out of thin air. He sneered and aimed the spear straight at Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"Stop!\" Lance cried out. He once again rushed forward, wanting to attack that Spear of Blood and Flesh.</p><br/><p>However, the old man\u2019s floating eyeball glanced at him and an invisible energy surged out and threw Lance to one side.</p><br/><p>Lance landed heavily on the ground. He struggled to stand but his legs were too damaged. He had completely lost his combat effectiveness.</p><br/><p>The soldiers who hid in the house wanted to come to his rescue, but the old man simply took a glance at them and they were all tossed twenty feet into the air.</p><br/><p>\"Mosquitos.\"</p><br/><p>The old man\u2019s gaze once again fell on Benjamin.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was still trapped. His face red, but still unable to speak a word.</p><br/><p>\"The boring drama shall end.\" The old man did not want to wait any longer and said coldly.</p><br/><p>The Spear of Blood and Flesh paused, then stabbed hard downward at Benjamin\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s over...\"</p><br/><p>Mikel watched as he hid in the house. He hopelessly closed his eyes and talked to himself. \"Why in the world did I follow them for? I should have just stayed in my comfy, safe room.\"</p><br/><p>His heart was full of regret.</p><br/><p>As a good government servant, his future was set. Why did he have to risk it all just because of an assault case that originally had seemed like nothing important? Now he was going to die in this horrible place.</p><br/><p>Like a person who was going to die, thoughts surged through his mind. Regrets, the happy and unhappy moments of the past, all the things he hasn\u2019t done ... to Mikel, these short few seconds went by as slowly as the first half of his life.</p><br/><p>But, it was an extremely dazed croon from the old man that brought him back from this dazed state.</p><br/><p>\"Hmm?\"</p><br/><p>Mikel was stunned. He opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>... What just happened?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After crystallizing up to a million of frosty army, he summoned billowing torrents and compressed, transformed in midair... to finally become a sky scraping huge dragon.</p><br/><p>The huge dragon craned his long neck as it let out a huge road. It followed the frosty army from behind, charging right at Grant.</p><br/><p>\"... Still not good enough.\"</p><br/><p>However, faced with such tremendous force, Grant wasn\u2019t the least bit surprised. He extended his arm as before and lightly dabbed. It seemed he himself has transformed into a rune character as some phantom flashed behind him.</p><br/><p>The holy light started to amass on his fingertip and a blazing golden flame was born in this shimmering light, and silently flickered.</p><br/><p>Grant casted the flame away.</p><br/><p>The weak flame traveled midair but burst open just before it crashed into the frosty army! A whirl of holy light spread open like a web caught in blazing fire. Multiple tiny light threads travelled within, bagging all the magic that Benjamin summoned.</p><br/><p>In a blink of an eye, more than half the frosty army evaporated. Any remaining magic had melted in that web.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Benjamin immediately caused the trapped magic to explode. With a loud bang, the holy light web trembled. Countless broken ice pieces scattered in the aftermath of the explosion, and darted around with its fatal edges.</p><br/><p>The giant water dragon pounced with his fangs wide open, biting down on the web of holy light.</p><br/><p>The two collided and triggered another grand explosion. Light and water elements amassed in the sky as they violently fluttered around. Out of the loud crash, there were also a series of smaller range explosions.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>In the end, with a final thud, the web of holy light ignited like fireworks and disappeared into the sky. The giant water dragon was also evaporated by the heat of numerous golden flames, returning to its elemental form.</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019ve said it already. If you wish to defeat it, this is not good enough.\" Grant\u2019s voice rang through the fire cracker of magic that has yet to disperse.</p><br/><p>Benjamin let out a cold snort.</p><br/><p>\"Oh really? What about this?\"</p><br/><p>As he said these words, his right hand suddenly started outlining in the sky. In a flash, the Elemental Order - Destroy was formed and a seed of elemental turbulence was tossed over.</p><br/><p>In a blink of an eye, the large quantity of uncontrolled water elements from the earlier collision was absorbed by the rune character and concentrated into the elemental turbulence. This time, Benjamin did not limit its growth in this unique elemental environment and let it inflate into a huge elemental windstorm!</p><br/><p>\u2014 If the water elements that Benjamin amassed from the first attack was impressive, then this elemental windstorm would be equally terrifying.</p><br/><p>The was his trump card that he prepared.</p><br/><p>Facing such an elemental windstorm that had such quick growth and still expanding, Grant\u2019s pupils darkened. He stretched his arm and dabbed a few times, each light dab had the emergence of a golden rune character.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the five runes combined to form a cross.</p><br/><p>A strange buzzing came from that golden cross, as if echoing within everyone\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>This sort of battle had scared the wits out of the people within a few thousand meter range. Be it the commanding officer and the army of soldiers, or any passerbys, they all could only look at the giant web and water dragon in the sky... Those humongous things beyond imagination biting at each other while they themselves could only tremble like tiny little ants.</p><br/><p>When that big elemental windstorm appeared, a strange buzzing rung in their hearts. They instinctively felt fear.</p><br/><p>\"... Right! Qui-Quickly call for backup!\"</p><br/><p>Out of the sudden, the commanding officer thought of something and ordered the soldiers beside him.</p><br/><p>Things have unraveled to this. Nobody knew what would happen next. Moreover, looking at the water inflating ball of windstorm, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a wave of uncertainty.</p><br/><p>The giant dragon earlier was frightening enough, now this? Could His Highness the Pope... defend against it?</p><br/><p>All sorts of fear added up had him recall the thought he should have realized ages ago. This area was desolated but there were still villages with churches. The priests in these churches could swiftly convey their message to the higher ups.</p><br/><p>However, even as he has sent out knights to call for help, the commanding officer still felt uneasy.</p><br/><p>His Highness the Pope... He was simply too irrational! He knew that that devil would come over to ambush him, why didn't he call more reinforcements?</p><br/><p>Just as the foraging team started to seek for help, the situation in the sky was also experiencing changes.</p><br/><p>\"Who would have thought he suppressed the elemental windstorm from expanding.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin stared at the sight in front of him and couldn\u2019t help but raise an eyebrow.</p><br/><p>After Grant drew that cross, with a mysterious oscillation, a golden glow suddenly appeared and enveloped the elemental windstorm. The originally violent and vicious elemental windstorm was now contained without any possibility of expansion.</p><br/><p>Benjamin couldn\u2019t control it to engulf Grant.</p><br/><p>However, the existence of the elemental windstorm did take away a lot of Grant\u2019s attention. At least, Grant didn't seem so at ease.</p><br/><p>As he was thinking this, Benjamin flew to great heights, surpassing the enormous elemental windstorm and looked down upon Grant. He then took out a crystal ball from his backpack.</p><br/><p>Grant narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\"In the intel from the Church, this thing should have quite a number of records, huh?\" Benjamin paced himself, \"You should understand its terror. I myself have never tested its limits, perhaps... now is a good time?\"</p><br/><p>Whizz!</p><br/><p>As he was talking, a wave of light thread suddenly flew from the front of Grant, directly at Benjamin.</p><br/><p>But, he activated the \"Descending of Water\", Benjamin\u2019s elemental control was no worse than Grant. In a flash, an ice mirror formed instantly by a large quantity of water elements that appeared before him. The light thread hit onto its surface, causing a small dent on the mirror but the light thread ricocheted and scratched Benjamin\u2019s sleeve.</p><br/><p>\"Sneak attack while others are still talking, is too old school. That won\u2019t do.\" Benjamin shook his head and continued with a calm demeanor.</p><br/><p>Grant let out a cold snort.</p><br/><p>\"Interesting. Why don\u2019t you try it then?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded and did not waste anymore of his breath. He used his Spiritual Energy to activate the crystal ball in his hands. Instantly, the inside of the ball lit up, emitting a light sense of danger.</p><br/><p>He then swung the glowing crystal ball like a bowing ball, and tossed it at Grant.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

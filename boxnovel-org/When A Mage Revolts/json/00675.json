When he came back to his senses, in a moment, his face looked as ugly as if he had swallowed dog feces.</p><br/><p>How, how could this be?</p><br/><p>The panic from being hit, the embarrassment and anger at being ridiculed, the unease at losing control of things\u2026 Various emotions surged up in him all at once, making his head heat up. A bomb seemed to have exploded inside his chest, shaking him up so much that he wanted to spit out a gallon of blood. He had an urge to turn and run.</p><br/><p>It was not something he had never thought about, but he would rather die than to face such a scene.</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026 You\u2026 What is this? How can you be the director? You, you lied! You\u2026 What do you want to do? Get away! We have nothing to talk about! I\u2026.\"</p><br/><p>In a turmoil of emotions, he opened his mouth to speak furiously, but the words coming out were not clear anymore, and no one knew what it was that he wanted to express.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Benjamin shook his head helplessly.</p><br/><p>\"What\u2019s the matter? When we met a few days ago, you were not like this, sir,\" He said slowly, \"Is it very awkward? You stole our law of meditation, and yet you talked so much in front of me. If I had done something like this, I would be embarrassed to look other people in the eye.\"</p><br/><p>\"You\u2026 How can you\u2026 How can this be\u2026\" Mage Hansen was still staring at Benjamin, rambling away.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t be surprised. I've caught Mage Randall, so I naturally know what you guys have done,\" Benjamin let out a cold scoff, saying, \"When I went to investigate a few days ago, of course, I knew you were telling lies at the time. You have pushed your plan forward, and preparing to announce it officially today, right?\"</p><br/><p>\".....You shameless fellow, you eavesdropped on us!\" A mage behind Hansen suddenly pointed at Benjamin, scolding. His face was almost red...</p><br/><p>Benjamin laughed, \"I\u2019m so sorry, but I still think what you\u2019ve done is even more shameless.\"</p><br/><p>\"Enough! What do you want to do?\" Hansen finally came back to reality, and could speak properly, \"You\u2026 Even if you are powerful, so what? A lot of people know that I\u2019m going to attend this gathering, if you dare touch us, your reputation will completely stink!\"</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he was doing his best to calm himself down.</p><br/><p>That was right\u2026 No matter how powerful this man was, he could not possibly do anything to them.</p><br/><p>Benjamin shrugged, saying, \"Who says I\u2019m going to touch you?\"</p><br/><p>For a moment, Hansen and the other mages furrowed their eyebrows tightly and exchanged looked, revealing uncertain and anxious expressions.</p><br/><p>What did this guy mean?</p><br/><p>\"...Is that so? If you have no issues, then we\u2019ll go first. People are still waiting for us there, let\u2019s meet at the gathering.\"</p><br/><p>Coming back to his senses, Hansen thought that Benjamin planned to stop them at the gathering, and had only come over now to show off. Because of that, he relaxed slightly and regained his calmness, saying this.</p><br/><p>As for when they get to the gathering\u2026 This guy had no proof, the runic law of meditation was still theirs!</p><br/><p>\"No, I\u2019d like for you to hold on a moment.\" Benjamin, however, gave a gentle smile and clapped his hands.</p><br/><p>At that moment, from beneath them, tens of mages suddenly flew up speedily, into the sky. Before Hansen and his men could react, they had surrounded them in a circle, watching Hansen and the mages with him. They did not seem very friendly.</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026 What are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>Hansen was somewhat stunned because he realized that there were many familiar faces amongst the people surrounding them.</p><br/><p>\"Mage Harry, Mage Alec\u2026 Members of the Mage Guild, since when have you been involved in the Academy of Magic? Are you not scared of losing credibility in Ferelden by doing this?\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m sorry. This is an order from Her Highness the Princess.\"The leader of the mages spoke, however. \"Benjamin has lodged a complaint saying that you have stolen the law of meditation owned by the Academy of Magic. I need you to come with me.\"</p><br/><p>Hansen was shocked.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, he quickly came back to his senses, and said furiously, \"No, this guy is lying! You have no proof whatsoever, I am being falsely accused!\"</p><br/><p>\"Accused or not, just come with us and we will know.\" The leader said coldly, \"Don\u2019t worry, sir. If you are indeed innocent, we will let you go very quickly.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, realization dawned on Hansen as he finally understood what Benjamin was doing.</p><br/><p>\"No, we have a very important gathering to attend, I cannot go with you\u2026\"</p><br/><p>\"You don\u2019t have to worry about this, sir. We have already sent our regards to the host of the gathering, the people from the \"Shadow\" Mages Organization will have to miss it because of an urgent matter,\" The manner in which the lead mage spoke was even more robotic than the System, \"You have to come with me, this is set by the laws of the country. When a complaint is accepted, the mage involved must cooperate with us and go through at least three hours of investigation.\"</p><br/><p>Hansen immediately rebutted, \"This is a completely unreasonable complaint, you have absolutely no right to demand our cooperation!\"</p><br/><p>\"It cannot be said to be an unreasonable complaint. Mage Benjamin has provided to us a piece of paper, claiming it to be a letter written by Mage Randall to you, and in it is content relevant to disclosure of the law of meditation.\"</p><br/><p>\"What\u2026 No! That must have been forged by him, what proof does he have that it was written by Mage Randall? On what basis are you saying that it was definitely written to me?\"</p><br/><p>The mages behind Hansen were also agreeing with him, and bawled out phrases like, \"That\u2019s right!\", \"On what basis?\", as though they had hardened their hearts, not wishing to follow the members of the Mage Guild.</p><br/><p>Their voices were very loud, and immediately drowned out the voice of the lead mage.</p><br/><p>However, the people on Benjamin\u2019s side were by no means fewer in number than they were. Tens of mages also began to speak, and the noise covered up their voices instead. In a few moments, the scene had gotten a bit out of control.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, one of the \"Shadow\" mages seemed to think of something, and secretly flew to Hansen, murmured in his ear from behind, \"This is not good, the time for the gathering is almost here. They are trying to delay us here!\"</p><br/><p>Hansen was startled.</p><br/><p>Coming back to his senses, he became extremely anxious, all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>Amazing, they had pulled such a trick\u2026</p><br/><p>They were only inches away from success; as long as they got to the gathering, even if they had no way of convincing everyone to believe them, the Academy of Magic would still be dragged into their dispute, and no one would be able to get a conclusion out of it.</p><br/><p>Under that situation, the Academy of Magic would definitely not dare to touch them.</p><br/><p>\"We are rushing to the gathering now, if you continue to block us, don\u2019t blame us if we get rough!\" Because of that, Hansen shouted unconsciously, in an anxious haste.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Benjamin\u2019s eyes flashed, and he rolled up his sleeves.</p><br/><p>\"Rough? We can finally begin to get rough?\"</p><br/><p>For a moment, a thought seemed to hit Hansen and the mages he brought. Their words got stuck in their throat, and they were once again stuck in their places.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He glanced at the officers around him, thought for a moment and said, \"It would be great if you understood. Can I know if you can help convince your colleagues?\"</p><br/><p>Although this high-ranked advisor appeared to be helping him, in fact, Benjamin felt the like he was being two-faced. These officers were just working together to put up a show and try and chase him away.</p><br/><p>Therefore, he threw the question to him instead.</p><br/><p>Spencer smiled and said, \"This is what I have been trying to do.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then, Sir, you must support have fully supported our plan to set up a branch in Carretas, right?\" Benjamin smiled and said, \"In fact, we just came to do business, get some tuition fees, and there is no need to go through this much trouble. If we have your approval, and since His Majesty does not have an opinion on this, we can get it started already. \"</p><br/><p>\"This\u2026\"</p><br/><p>Finally, the high-ranked advisor had a stressed look from being forced.</p><br/><p>\"Forget it, we are done for today.\" The King shook his head and finally spoke, \"Mister Messenger traveled thousands of miles to Gealorre, so it will only be fair if we have a welcome party for you. Tonight, we will have a banquet in the palace, and all the officers will also attend. These stubborn old officers will probably only listen to you under the relaxed atmosphere of the party.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin frowned after hearing that. However, he seemed to have thought of something and eventually, he did not reject the invitation.</p><br/><p>\"I am looking forward to Your Majesty's kindness.\"</p><br/><p>Then, he turned around and left. The high-ranked advisor seemed to want to stop him and invite him to rest in one of the rooms in the palace. However, it seemed like Benjamin did not hear him, as he left without turning back and walked out of the palace.</p><br/><p>However, in Benjamin\u2019s mind\u2026</p><br/><p>\"Is the King an imposter?\" He asked in an unusually heavy tone.</p><br/><p>\"Probably... not...\" The System replied, \"Previously, I did not say that he was an imposter, but he just seems a little weird. He is the same person from before as all his physiological characteristics match.\"</p><br/><p>\"Then what happened? Did the Church really made a comeback?\"</p><br/><p>\"Why are you asking me? How do I know?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head helplessly. </p><br/><p>At that moment, his mood was actually quite heavy. He knew clearly that the King was not a reliable king, but after all, Benjamin felt like even if the Church wanted to do something, they should start with Icor, instead of the King.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 Based on the situation that he was in, it did seem like some forces were making a comeback. They had secretly controlled Carretas, and they wanted to cause havoc in this country again which had just finally calmed down.</p><br/><p>Other than the Church, Benjamin could not think of any other candidate.</p><br/><p>He could not help but think about Grant.</p><br/><p>Benjamin had already known all too well about the usual conspiracies of the Church. However, after the change of hands, Grant had just gotten the Pope\u2019s position and he had already personally killed his own father. Then, just like the previous church leaders, he could start ordering priests around and cause chaos in the world?</p><br/><p>Benjamin sighed.</p><br/><p>As he walked out of the palace, he used the water element to spy on what was happening in the palace. However, he did not find any clues. There weren\u2019t any crosses in the King's bedroom, and there were no letters from the Church in the secret chamber below the palace. Whereas among the servants who were walking back and forth the corridor, none of them had an abnormal amount of spiritual energy.</p><br/><p>However, Benjamin did not lower his guard.</p><br/><p>The Church knew the way he worked, and they had failed multiple times under his hands, so they would certainly be more careful. If they were to really have a comeback, they would probably not leave any clues in the palace.</p><br/><p>He had no choice but to rely on his own intuition, or the System\u2019s intuition to determine the situation. However, after thinking about it, it was so unreliable!</p><br/><p>Still\u2026 since Benjamin was strong, he did not need to be afraid.</p><br/><p>He would just wait and see. If more clues were to show up, he did not mind sneaking into the palace tonight to kidnap the King.</p><br/><p>Therefore, after walking all around Gealorre, Benjamin did not find any place to crash in, instead, he found a restaurant, ordered the cheapest cake there, took out his own food, and sat there from noon to night under the furious gaze of the shopkeeper.</p><br/><p>At night, the streets of Gealorre was as quiet as the deep sea, only a few people were walking by occasionally.</p><br/><p>Benjamin went back to the palace.</p><br/><p>\"Mister Messenger, you are finally here! I thought you were mad, so you went back to the academy.\" Spencer stood at the front door and greeted Benjamin warmly.</p><br/><p>Benjamin felt like there were some hidden messages in his words. Therefore, he rejected Spencer\u2019s request to have a friendly embrace and went straight inside the palace.</p><br/><p>Unlike the streets outside, the royal palace was very lively. Even in the corridor, he could already vaguely hear some music and noises. The servants who were walking in and out were so busy that a few of them almost knocked on Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"Please excuse us. Ever since the King regained his throne, he did not want to seem wasteful, therefore, sometimes there will be a lack of staff problem in the palace.\" Spencer said with a smile at the side.</p><br/><p>\"Ha ha.\" Benjamin said casually, \"Sir, as an advisor, you are so familiar with the errands in the palace, it is admirable.\"</p><br/><p>Finally, Spencer was left speechless after hearing what Benjamin said, and Benjamin finally got to have a quiet time to himself.</p><br/><p>Since there weren\u2019t any mages here, he could freely activate the sensing technique. However, what he saw was just the scene of any other ordinary banquet. The restaurant was decorated with flowers, an orchestra was playing at the corner, young and beautiful dancers were dancing on the stage, and the officers were holding glasses of wines with a red flush on their faces while they smiled and talked to each other... it seemed like there was nothing wrong with it.</p><br/><p>Benjamin had just entered the banquet hall, and he was surrounded by a group of people who reeked of alcohol as they greeted him.</p><br/><p>He had no choice but to squeeze a smile and reluctantly cope with the officers who showed him a straight face during the day.</p><br/><p>\"Mister Advisor, where did His Majesty go?\" Benjamin looked left and right but he did not see the King. So he turned around and asked Spencer.</p><br/><p>\"The group of dancers came from abroad, Your Majesty... invited a lady and went to the garden for star gazing.\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>Not knowing the reason, Benjamin believed that this was something that the real King would do.</p><br/><p>\"Mister Messenger, since you have come to the banquet, why not relax and enjoy yourself? You do not want others to think that you are a gloomy freak, right?\" Spencer took the glass of wine from the waiter who was passing by, handed it to Benjamin and said.</p><br/><p>Benjamin frowned.</p><br/><p>However, he took the glass of wine, checked it and downed it.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t drink it, there is something wrong with this wine!\" However, the System suddenly appeared and warned loudly.</p><br/><p> (Hongmen): Banquet set up with the aim of murdering a guest</p><br/>\n</div>"}

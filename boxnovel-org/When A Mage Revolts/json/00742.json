From what he saw, there were still a large number of Icor soldiers, so they were not overwhelmed by the soldiers from the Kingdom of Helius.</p><br/><p>Then... then...</p><br/><p>Benjamin could not help but take a deep breath.</p><br/><p>Another coup again.</p><br/><p>\"Director, what should we do? It seems like someone from below found out about us.\" Lara frowned and said after she looked downwards.</p><br/><p>Benjamin recovered, suddenly stretched out his hand and made an \u2018attack\u2019 gesture.</p><br/><p>\"Go...go!\"</p><br/><p>Under the situation where the mages did not understand what was happening, Benjamin waved his hand and led them into the palace. A few ice arrows were made, before the guards at the gate of the palace could even open their mouths, they were pierced in the chest and had fallen to the ground.</p><br/><p>Benjamin landed on the ground, and rushed into the palace without hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014 Although he did not know why did this happen, but based on the current state of Regina, he could probably guess. </p><br/><p>Coups happened in this city too often. It happened once because of the Church, however, at that time the Queen was present, so she took advantage of that opportunity to eliminate all the Church\u2019s undercover operations, and there were no major consequences after that.</p><br/><p>Although now the Church was playing the same old trick, but Regina had no idea about it.</p><br/><p>After rushing into the palace, Benjamin quickly activated the water element sensing technique, and tried to scan every corner possible. He saw the two priests behind the corner of the corridor, several paladins and officers in the palace hall, and a bishop in the study room...</p><br/><p>\"I think I heard something, did someone rush in?\"</p><br/><p>\"Be careful, let's go out and have a look.\"</p><br/><p>The two priests at the corner of the corridor was talking as they walked towards Benjamin. After they took a turn around the corner, they were faced with two water balls.</p><br/><p>Boom! Boom!</p><br/><p>The priests were submerged into a water ball, and their life-saving crosses broke under the rapid water flow of the water ball. In just a blink of an eye, the two priests were frozen into ice sculptures, fell to the ground and shattered.</p><br/><p>Benjamin did not even linger for half a second longer, instead he continued to rush towards the hall of the palace.</p><br/><p>In the hall, there were a few familiar officers, and they should be important officers of Icor. At the moment, they were happily conversing with the paladins, without a doubt, they were the reason why the Church were able to start the coup.</p><br/><p>However, Benjamin failed to find the Guild master in the palace.</p><br/><p>He had a very bad feeling in his heart.</p><br/><p>\"Director, wait for us ...\"</p><br/><p>The rest of the mages quickly caught up from behind, Joanna waved and shouted.</p><br/><p>Benjamin turned around and said: \"All of you go to the study room first, there is a bishop there, try to keep him there and do not let him get away. The girl that can cast spells, come with me!\"</p><br/><p>The mages were surprised, but they reacted quickly, and nodded. At the forked path of the palace\u2019s corridor, Benjamin rushed to the palace hall with the girl, whereas the rest of the mages headed towards the study room.</p><br/><p>\"Who are you? The laws and regulations are not to be violated, how can you enter the palace hall casually?\"</p><br/><p>When Benjamin kicked open the door, rushed in from the front door, and the few officers in the hall turned around. One of them had his hands on this waist and questioned righteously.</p><br/><p>The paladins took out their swords and glared at them.</p><br/><p>Benjamin sneered coldly, waved his hands and countless ice arrows were formed. All the paladins and priests in the hall could not even hold up for even more than two seconds.</p><br/><p>Two seconds later, their bodies fell to the ground, and the officers were stunned from the shock.</p><br/><p>\"Do not recognize me? I am a life-long member of the Judgement Parliament, mage Benjamin.\" Benjamin slowly walked towards the officers, and said coldly, \"I'm sorry, but the laws and regulations that you\u2019re using to scare me, the Guild Master and I created it.\"</p><br/><p>After reminding them, the officers were so frightened that they immediately kneeled on the ground.</p><br/><p>\"Di-Director? You... why are you here? We... we... please listen to our explanation, things are not what you see, we...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin waved his hand and the ice arrows interrupted them. Then, the bodies of the few officers fell onto the ground, with only one still alive, which was trembling and hiding at the corner.</p><br/><p>---- It was enough to keep only one alive.</p><br/><p>\"I do not have time to interrogate them, use your magic to control his mind and make him tell us everything.\" He turned around and said to the girl.</p><br/><p>The girl nodded. Soon, her spiritual energy started spreading, and the remaining officer\u2019s body trembled. Gradually, the frightened look on his face disappeared, and he became lifeless.</p><br/><p>\"Where are the rest of the people in the palace?\" Benjamin asks coldly.</p><br/><p>\"They... the guards are being were paid to leave, and the soldiers who are fighting outside should be wiped out soon. All the servants have been killed, and the disobedient officers are being thrown into jail...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin quickly asked: \"What about the mages? And the Guild master? What happened to them?\"</p><br/><p>\"The mages... has been purified by the Bishop. We lured the Guild Master to a pub in the city, drugged him, tied him up with anti-magic chains and sent him away.\"</p><br/><p>So the Guild Master was not died yet.</p><br/><p>Benjamin was slightly relieved and immediately asked: \"Where do you plan to send him to?\"</p><br/><p>\"I... I do not know.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin instantly frowned deeply.</p><br/><p>He did not expect the Church to be so well prepared. Not only did they take control of the palace through a coup, they even lured the Guild Master into a trap and easily eliminated the greatest threat of the Church.</p><br/><p>Although Benjamin still had a lot of questions, but now... he need to rescue the Guild Master!</p><br/><p>He was responsible for most of Icor's military arrangements, which was probably the reason why the Church abducted him. Benjamin speculated that the 100,000 soldiers still remained at the border and they were completely being cut off from any news, they might not even know what happened in Regina.</p><br/><p>In fact, the coup occurred only in the city of Regina.</p><br/><p>After thinking about it, the church\u2019s plan was actually very clear. It was a beheading tactic -- they were disinclined to attack Icor\u2019s solid defense, so they started a coup in Regina and was planning to destroy Icor internally!</p><br/><p>Therefore... they need the Guild Master alive.</p><br/><p>They still need to make use of the Guild Master to control the one hundred thousand soldiers.</p><br/><p>After thinking about this, Benjamin quickly left the hall with the girl.</p><br/><p>If anyone in the royal palace knew where the Guild Master was taken to, that person would be the Bishop in the study room!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The townsfolk couldn\u2019t understand what happened. All they saw was the pastor\u2019s corpse on the church\u2019s podium.</p><br/><p>From the horrified look worn by the corpse, the settlers imagined the pastor saw something nightmarish before his death. Yet\u2026 no one had any clue what had occurred. The rain stopped, the water which rushed into the church disappeared without a trace. All that\u2019s left was the dried spot of blood on the ground as if the \"pitter-patter\" that reverberated in their ears was just an illusion.</p><br/><p>When the church\u2019s disciples hurried out and gathered the incident from the rest of the townsfolk, they could only respond with, \"Rain? There wasn\u2019t any! The sun is shining, the ground is dry, when has it even rained?\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, the disciples\u2019 were wearing not the face of panic, but rather one of pure terror.</p><br/><p>No matter how much they bend their minds around it, they probably couldn\u2019t have figured out what just occurred. However, everything that happened within this morning had probably scarred their hearts deeply.</p><br/><p>Soon, news of what transpired in the small town\u2019s church was documented in an urgent message by the local officials and sent a report to the royal city. Moreover, they never would have expected this kind of incidents occurring one after another within the Holy Kingdom.</p><br/><p>From the edge of the outskirts, gradually reaching the heart of the kingdom, Benjamin left a long, fine line through the deaths of pastors. While the churches had yet to react, he flew as he made his move, committing multiple cultish ways of killing, painting a streak of red across each passing church,</p><br/><p>Of course, chances like \"murder in rain\" in that small town were hard to come by. Most of the time, the pastors died alone, in which case Benjamin nailed them onto the churches\u2019 figures, making it seem like God\u2019s hands had pierced through their torsos.</p><br/><p>This kind of death would definitely grab the churches\u2019 undivided attention on the grandest scale, in addition to wavering the disciples\u2019 faith.</p><br/><p>With everything going according to Benjamin\u2019s prediction, two days later, he stained eighteen churches in blood, the entire Holy Kingdom was plunged into an air of murder.</p><br/><p>\"Have you heard? A lot of pastors died lately, apparently\u2026 someone from within the church triggered God\u2019s rage, and so punishments were brought down by the divine spirits!\"</p><br/><p>\"I\u2019m not sure myself, but with that display of death. If they had not angered the divine spirits, what else it could be?\"</p><br/><p>The rumors spread like wildfire, and soon many became flustered and panicked. Benjamin couldn\u2019t help but wonder, did the royal families play a part in the shadows for the churches\u2019 downfall?</p><br/><p>The churches naturally didn\u2019t remain motionless.</p><br/><p>Battalions of holy knights converged in the center of the kingdom, their commander vision caught glimpses of the pastors\u2019 former selves in his journey. The churches made a public announcement, disclosing that an evil mage was stirring an uproar within the kingdom. They asked that the people should avoid panic, for they would soon apprehend the criminal for judgment.</p><br/><p>Yet\u2026 the people were still uneasy.</p><br/><p>This was so, especially those who resided within the \"line\". The church-murder cases happened in an order, similar to a phantom thief leaving a calling card before committing a crime, announcing to the world their next target. Everyone figured it out, based on the evident line left by the \"evil mage\", they could predict the next unfortunate church to be hit.</p><br/><p>As such, the people residing in the town nearby didn\u2019t dare venture into that church to pray.</p><br/><p>\"According to that bastard\u2019s profile, he should be appearing at this time today, right?\"</p><br/><p>Inside out a certain town\u2019s church, countless pastors, holy knights\u2026 perhaps even the grandmasters, a few teams of assassins and countless other people guarded the church under the night\u2019s shroud, waiting to spring upon their approaching foe.</p><br/><p>One holy knight couldn\u2019t resist himself from asking, \"So grandmaster\u2026 do you truly believe that pretentious bastard came to our Holy Kingdom?\"</p><br/><p>\"Hmph, other from him, who else could it have been?\" said a grandmaster hiding amongst the group.</p><br/><p>\"But we have so many people guarding here, would he still come if he had seen us?\"</p><br/><p>\"Do not think that you possess a similar train of thought compared to those mages who are no different from psychopaths,\" said the grandmaster, \"Our duty is to defend this church, we only need to prevent any mages from getting near. If we could scare him off, then we have accomplished our mission.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright then\u2026 and here I thought, we could utterly purge that bastard today.\"</p><br/><p>The grandmaster, however calmly smiled and said, \"No need for us to be hasty, God has a plan for this sort of thing.\"</p><br/><p>A similar scene could be found in churches in nearby towns. In order to put an end to the pastor serial killings, the churches sent out many of their men. Even the main streets in these towns were filled with guards, with their eyes fixated on the clouds above, watching out for any suspicious flying figures.</p><br/><p>However, at this time, Benjamin had already left far behind this area.</p><br/><p>In a small village lying at the south of the kingdom, gazing upon the distant, extravagant mansion, Benjamin nodded to himself.</p><br/><p>\"So this is the Walter Family\u2019s estate.\" Benjamin thought.</p><br/><p>With the church utterly shaken, various men were sent out. If he were to attack the church again, what difference would it be as compared to seeking his own death? The main goal was to attract the church\u2019s attention after all, and now, he had achieved it.</p><br/><p>With an ambush planned for him near the church, even if they had waited until dawn, Benjamin wouldn\u2019t be making his appearance there.</p><br/><p>He instead strolled towards the Walter Family\u2019s mansion.</p><br/><p>\"Apparently after their daughter \"succumbed to illness\", the Walters rarely made their stay in the Royal Kingdom recently, shutting themselves within their own estate and hardly interacting with any outsiders even.\" His assistant uttered, \"But\u2026 are you really here just to take a look?\"</p><br/><p>\"What else?\"</p><br/><p>His assistant said, \"After the school\u2019s quiet demise, they never received any news regarding their daughter, she\u2019s probably presumed dead. Circumstances aside, you should inform them about her!\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head and replied, \"It\u2019s not like Elizabeth had let me have my way with her body, it would be best if I don\u2019t stick my nose in this trivial matter.\"</p><br/><p>\"...Forget it, you\u2019re hopeless.\"</p><br/><p>Without a concern for his assistant\u2019s jibberish, Benjamin approached the mansion from the outside and sensed the interior. He found only a few maids busying themselves with cleaning, not a trace of the Walters' presence.</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s eyebrows tightened.</p><br/><p>...Where could they be?</p><br/><p>Benjamin disguised himself as a merchant. As such, after given some thoughts, he approached the mansion\u2019s grand gate, and questioned the still-snoozing guard posted there, \"Greetings, I\u2019m here to pay a visit to Count Walter, may I ask if he\u2019s present?\"</p><br/><p>\"My apologies. Our master and mistress had just left, may I ask that you come by again tomorrow?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin then asked, \"Then\u2026 would you mind telling me to where has Count Walter gone?\"</p><br/><p>The guardsman hesitated, but under Benjamin\u2019s persistent questioning, he gave in and said, \"Actually I\u2019m not too sure myself. But if everything went accordingly, he and the mistress should be heading to the graveyard to gift flowers to the young missus.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin listened and nodded.</p><br/><p>\"Thank you.\"</p><br/><p>And with that, he turned to leave. The guardsman watched his back as he left, eyes filled with suspicion, but soon he lost interest. He shut his eyelids and fell asleep.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

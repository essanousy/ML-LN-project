How do we begin to research it?\"</p><br/><p>After that question was posed, it was not just one person who nodded.</p><br/><p>The most common research method in the magical world was through various slicings. Slicing magical creatures to be made into potions, slicing plants that contained elements to be made into magical instruments... The spirit was, obviously, an organism that was beyond their conventional understanding, so the common method was definitely not a good one. They could only undergo the simplest method of research through observation.</p><br/><p>Benjamin rubbed his chin, and suddenly thought of psychic powers.</p><br/><p>If the two siblings were brought here, could they have a different opinion concerning this thing?</p><br/><p>And so, the liberation of the spirit was considered to be done. These mages decided to starve the spirit for a few days and see what changes it would undergo, before undergoing research on things such as its feeding behavior and illusion principles. The spirit was trapped here, unable to get out.</p><br/><p>And when the last mage had left the laboratory, Benjamin found the two siblings and got them to come over.</p><br/><p>\"Honorable mage, this... Whose spirit have you dragged out from the underworld? This is a great sin that insults the will of God!\"</p><br/><p>When they saw the spirit, the siblings had jumped in shock. The young lady had obviously not yet completely cast aside her past beliefs, and when she had recovered her senses and taken a deep breath, she spoke somewhat nervously.</p><br/><p>\"What will of God? It\u2019s all bullshit.\" Benjamin asked in fascination, \"Tell me, how much do you know about this thing?\"</p><br/><p>Seeing the faces of these two people, it was as though this was not the first time they had seen a spirit...</p><br/><p>Hearing that, the two siblings looked at each other. In the end, the young lad was the one who spoke, saying: \"Every time an elder passes away, the flamens will proceed with a ceremony to preserve his spirit, as a blessing for us from the younger generation. Some spirits of the elders have been enshrined in the ancestral altar on the island, and worshipped. They looked just like... Just like the one that you have here.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was extremely taken aback: \"You know how to create spirits? Aren\u2019t you afraid that its screams would lull you into an illusion, and you\u2019ll all be eaten up?\"</p><br/><p>\"Not really.\" The young lad shook his head, however, saying, \"They are our ancestors, they would not eat people at random. Also, only the ordinary man who has not harnessed psychic powers would fall into illusions. We are not afraid.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded thoughtfully.</p><br/><p>After some thought, he noticed that by harnessing psychic powers, one would definitely have maintained a huge amount of spiritual energy that far surpassed that of an ordinary human being. Just like the flamen at that time, when these people died, their spirits would definitely not decay so easily, and would stay in the world of the living, existing as spirits.</p><br/><p>Listening to the young lad\u2019s words, they seemed to be able to instruct the spirits. This was not an easy feat. Even if it was the spirit of some elder who had passed away, as time passed, their conscious will would slowly perish as well, leaving behind a wild, beast-like instinct.</p><br/><p>\"Do you have a way to control this spirit?\" Thinking thus, Benjamin immediately asked.</p><br/><p>\"That... That\u2019s too difficult, we don\u2019t know that yet.\" The young lad shook his head, but he seemed to be afraid of letting Benjamin down, so he hurriedly added a few more words, \"However, we can try to talk to it.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Benjamin had a strange expression.</p><br/><p>\"Try talking to it.\"</p><br/><p>The two siblings nodded, and slowly went over to the glass cover. Their attitude towards the spirit was very clearly different from that of the other mages; there was not a trace of curiosity or the slightest bit of fear. Without hesitation, they stretched out their hands and opened the side lid of the glass cover.</p><br/><p>Immediately after that, the young lady closed her eyes, as though composing words in her mind.</p><br/><p>Following that, an interesting scene unfolded.</p><br/><p>The spirit, which had been floating about behind the glass panes, suddenly stopped, as though it had been paused in a definite spot in midair. The System also expressed that it had just detected a somewhat different spiritual energy disturbance.</p><br/><p>Benjamin could not help but put on a pensive expression.</p><br/><p>If the psychic spellcasters could control spirits... There were so many more in the deep abyss. These two siblings would be going against nature.</p><br/><p>After a moment, the young lady seemed to have stopped communications, and opened her eyes. At the side, the young man closed up the lid on the glass cover. They turned around and walked back to Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"This spirit... Is terrified and confused. It seems to have gone through many, many years, and it has forgotten who it was. Communication with it is also extremely difficult.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was not interested in the spirit\u2019s feelings. All he asked was: \"Can you command it?\"</p><br/><p>The two of them shook their heads.</p><br/><p>\"How could it obey us?\" The young lady said, \"Every spirit hates the living. The elders had a secret method to wipe away this hatred, but at the same time, the spirit\u2019s power of resonance would also be wiped out.\"</p><br/><p>\"Power of resonance would be wiped out? What does this mean?\"</p><br/><p>\"It means it would not be able to produce illusions to the ordinary man, and would not be able to undergo consumption as before.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing all this, Benjamin was temporarily disappointed.</p><br/><p>A tamed spirit would lose its only weapon, was this what it meant? If that was the case, what was the use of taming them? Get it to float about and spook people?</p><br/><p>\"Then why had you still kept so many spirits in your alter?\" Benjamin asked.</p><br/><p>\"I am not clear myself.\" The young lad answered, \"But the elders had said that if the clan ever got into a critical emergency, the spirits of the ancestors would protect us and defeat all enemies that come.\"</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Benjamin nodded.</p><br/><p>It seemed that there was a special approach, only, everything was hidden on the island beyond the sea.</p><br/><p>\"So now... What can you get this spirit to do?\"</p><br/><p>\"There\u2019s really nothing to be done, it is too small and weak.\" The young lady shook her head, saying, \"You should feed it something. If this continues on, it will most probably turn violent.\"</p><br/><p>\"Violent? What is that like?\"</p><br/><p>\"In a certain period of time, it will possess an extremely frightening spiritual energy, and can even move objects in reality just by willing it, destroying everything around it in a frenzy. After the violent frenzy, it will disappear by themselves, leaving nothing behind.\"</p><br/><p>\"Alright...\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was sweating in embarrassment. They had initially planned to starve the spirit for a while and observe it; it was lucky that he had asked this extra question, or else trouble would have happened.</p><br/><p>Only, thinking about the scene where the spirit controlled the bird, the felt that this spirit was possibly different from the typical spirits. An organism that had left the habitat it had lived in for so long, and was so stubborn\u2026 It must have been changed, somehow.</p><br/><p>Because of that, he described what had happened to the two siblings. After listening to it all, the two people could not help but look astonished.</p><br/><p>\"Is that\u2026.. Is that the process of taming the ancestral spirits?\" The young lady spoke words that Benjamin could not understand.</p><br/><p>\"How could it have been tamed? Can it be tamed just by suppressing it in some living body?\" He asked hurriedly, \"But it was so damn cranky while controlling the bird.\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

What if you miscalculated?\" Suddenly, the System voiced out in</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s Space of Consciousness.</p><br/><p>\"I did not miscalculate.\" Benjamin answered expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>He thought that once Augustine bore news to him, Varys would have prepared everything and that</p><br/><p>he would be sneaking into a sack full of wheat, transported to the Crusader Gateway, and be</p><br/><p>stealing the cross that very night.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t think that Augustine would inform him of something very different.</p><br/><p>He came to Benjamin\u2019s rented room during the afternoon. Benjamin returned to reality from his</p><br/><p>meditation and was told about a Mage from the little guild \u2014 news on Andrew, the stammerer who</p><br/><p>has a talent on magical equipment.</p><br/><p>\"Andrew? There\u2019s new development?\" Upon hearing his name, Benjamin was caught off guard. He</p><br/><p>quickly came back to his senses and followed up. His plan to steal the cross was to help Andrew in</p><br/><p>researching new ways to deflect the cross. He hadn't even made a move yet and Andrew came</p><br/><p>through on his end. Benjamin wouldn\u2019t have to put himself in danger.</p><br/><p>He was filled with anticipation when he went up to see Andrew.</p><br/><p>However, his anticipation was not met by reality. There was no new development in Andrew\u2019s</p><br/><p>research. However, he told Benjamin a valuable bit of information.</p><br/><p>\"My u-uncle is also a Mage. He has be-been secretly serving the nobles in Morten up north.\"</p><br/><p>Andrew stammered with excitement, \"He just to-told me, that a few days ago, a small army took off</p><br/><p>from a lo-local church and is co-coming towards here. He said, the army is-is transporting new</p><br/><p>backup cro-crosses to the gates.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin was dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>New backup crosses?</p><br/><p>Benjamin has always been curious on how the Church creates the magical equipment. For so</p><br/><p>many crosses, surely the Church has some designated location and personnel for production and</p><br/><p>research, such as some cross factory or cross research faculty. This was where Benjamin was</p><br/><p>stumped.</p><br/><p>Take the crosses used at the gateway to check for mages as an example, the cross definitely did</p><br/><p>not come from the gates but should have been pre-made elsewhere and sent over.</p><br/><p>He quickly forced these questions to the back of his head but surprisingly Andrew knew the</p><br/><p>answers anyway.</p><br/><p>\"Where is this army?\" He asked, \"They haven\u2019t reached the Town of Crewe, have they? Which</p><br/><p>route did they take, does your uncle know?\"</p><br/><p>A platoon of soldiers transporting backup crosses was like pork belly sent to his mouth for</p><br/><p>Benjamin. Taking care of them, being in the middle of nowhere, without the protection of the</p><br/><p>gateway and fortress would be easy for Benjamin who has recovered all his abilities.</p><br/><p>Come to think of it, he could snatch the crosses right from the palm of their hands instead of risking</p><br/><p>himself by being stuffed in a wheat sack and smuggled into the gates.</p><br/><p>More conveniently, he could disguise the whole scene to look like there was a beast attack after</p><br/><p>taking care of the soldiers. It wouldn\u2019t raise any red flags - safe and highly efficient.</p><br/><p>\"He ru-rushed over, so he could reach before the so-soldiers, to inform u-us on this.\" Andrew</p><br/><p>answered, \"He said, tomorrow mo-morning, the soldiers would reach Town of Cr-Crewe, so to-</p><br/><p>tonight is our only chance.\"</p><br/><p>Tonight, it is...</p><br/><p>Benjamin didn\u2019t feel rushed, on the contrary, the timing was just right.</p><br/><p>He had been in this forsaken town for far too long. They could finally leave the Kingdom of Helius</p><br/><p>once they obtained the cross and Andrew finishes decoding the puzzle.</p><br/><p>Benjamin immediately decided to make a move that very night to intercept the soldiers from</p><br/><p>sending the crosses. In the event that the plan fails, he would have Varys execute plan B to sneak</p><br/><p>into the gates.</p><br/><p>After making the decision, he met with Andrew\u2019s uncle. Andrew\u2019s uncle told Benjamin that the</p><br/><p>platoon took the road at the foot of the mountains around the border for safety and confidentiality</p><br/><p>sake. He even told Benjamin the map of possible routes they would take later on. When Benjamin</p><br/><p>investigated, he found that no matter which route the soldiers took, there would always be a</p><br/><p>crossroad that they\u2019d eventually pass by.</p><br/><p>It looked like it was going to be an easy job. As long as he waited at the crossroads, the crosses</p><br/><p>would show up.</p><br/><p>Benjamin said his goodbyes to Andrew and returned to his room to prepare. He had specially</p><br/><p>contacted the rest of the town\u2019s mages and had another meeting. He took off from the Town of</p><br/><p>Crewe and headed north of the mountains as the day was getting late.</p><br/><p>And there he was, hiding behind the rock of a narrow mountainous pathway, not moving an inch.</p><br/><p>The day has yet to darken when he reached the area. He had his patience tested as he hid behind</p><br/><p>a bigger rock and closed his eyes to release the Water Particle Detection. Like a spider on a web,</p><br/><p>he waited for his prey to come along.</p><br/><p>He never thought it would take so long.</p><br/><p>From afternoon to evening, from evening to night, there he was, hiding behind a rock, observing</p><br/><p>his surroundings. A flock of birds flew overhead, a herd of rabbits scampered by ... This place</p><br/><p>was indeed in the middle of nowhere and Benjamin had been waiting for more than six hours. Yet</p><br/><p>not a single human shadow has been seen.</p><br/><p>Using the Water Particle Detection spell for more than six hours was also draining his Spiritual</p><br/><p>Energy.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but temporarily halt the spell as he was getting tired. He opened his eyes to use</p><br/><p>his now impaired senses to visually observe his surroundings</p><br/><p>He started to feel nervous.</p><br/><p>What hadn\u2019t they arrive yet?</p><br/><p>What if nobody was coming ... that would be a problem.</p><br/><p>And that was how the initial conversation with the System was initiated. Although the System was</p><br/><p>such a weakling now, it still couldn\u2019t help but remind Benjamin of a possible miscalculation.</p><br/><p>Benjamin, on the other hand, just as he put it, believed his judgment couldn\u2019t be wrong.</p><br/><p>Luckily, it wasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>After a long wait, the prey arrived.</p><br/><p>About ten minutes after stopping his Water Particle Detection spell, a humanly figure started to</p><br/><p>appear from the dark blurry mountain pathway. Benjamin saw the figure and a smile cheekily lit up.</p><br/><p>Finally, they were here.</p><br/><p>However, what emerged from the dark, wasn\u2019t the figures of solders transporting crosses but rather</p><br/><p>a single person.</p><br/><p>Someone who Benjamin was familiar with.</p><br/><p>He was wearing a pitch-black Mage robe with a hump on his back. If no special attention was</p><br/><p>given, he could easily blend in with the dark. He was not wearing a hood, revealing his messy hair</p><br/><p>which made it easier for Benjamin to recognise him.</p><br/><p>He came in close and stopped short by the rock Benjamin was hiding behind.</p><br/><p>\"Mr. Grant, it\u2019s better for you to come out. Although I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re hiding, but this game</p><br/><p>of hide and seek is a waste of time. If you think you can escape now, it\u2019s far too late for that.\"</p><br/><p>Andrew looked around his surroundings after letting out the threat. He carried a cold smile and was</p><br/><p>in high spirit. The fluidity of his speech bore no sign of stammer.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Using magic to cut off noise was a technique that he had been using for a long time now. However... he was not sure if he would be able to cut off the sound that was causing the illusion.</p><br/><p>Not to mention doing so in less than a second.</p><br/><p>Within such a brief period, Benjamin closed his eyes as though he was a diver who was trying to calm himself down before the competition. Then, he asked the System to activate the last second of the intangible form, while he was simultaneously trying to control the water bubble that was surrounding them.</p><br/><p>\"You... what are you doing?\"</p><br/><p>At the same time, Dick who was watching him from the side was in a confused state.</p><br/><p>He was already frozen half dead, and he felt like his ability to think had started to degenerate. However, Benjamin had stopped in mid-air for quite some time already and was neither moving forward nor retreating, which was why Dick was starting to panic.</p><br/><p>He looked at Benjamin with a stunned look, even after the water bubble was summoned and had surrounded the two of them, he still continued to move in an almost trance-like state.</p><br/><p>Eventually, Benjamin even started to suspect Dick of losing his mind due to the frigid cold.</p><br/><p>Dick initially felt like the idea to cross the Skyfall Mountain was very unreliable ---- why would anyone challenge the legend? However, because he needed to depend on Benjamin, he dared not directly oppose the idea, and all he could do was just hold it in.</p><br/><p>But... look! What was happening?</p><br/><p>Dick was filled with despair.</p><br/><p>Even though he was not capable of beating it, he still chose the most difficult way. After Benjamin had become a mage, he had gradually gotten prouder. Even after stealing the key that his father had given to him, he still chose to try to cross this impossible mountain, and now they might even be frozen to death halfway through!</p><br/><p>How could his father put their only hope in such person before he died?</p><br/><p>The more Dick thought about it, the more hopeless he felt.</p><br/><p>Shit\u2026 would the bloodline of the Fulner family die off in this freezing land?</p><br/><p>After holding in his emotions for such a long time, Dick could not take it any longer and was ready to shout with all his might and order Benjamin to leave the mountain. However, at that moment, the water bubble that was surrounding them suddenly froze.</p><br/><p>Dick was surprised.</p><br/><p>It was as though a huge ice hockey ball was formed, and Benjamin and Dick were wrapped inside it; the original soft and flexible water film became a stiff ice that would not budge. At that moment, Dick thought that Benjamin could not even control his own magic due to the cold environment.</p><br/><p>However, when he looked through the translucent ice layer, that idea instantly vanished.</p><br/><p>\"M-my god... what is this place?\"</p><br/><p>This was not the tall Skyfall Mountains, the entire place was dim, and everything looked extremely eerie. Dick was frightened and immediately fell to the ground with cold sweats all over his head.</p><br/><p>This... This...</p><br/><p>Teleportation magic? How did they teleport here?</p><br/><p>Dick\u2019s mind was filled with panic and confusion. Benjamin spoke slowly at that moment.</p><br/><p>\"You saw it?\"</p><br/><p>Dick raised his head, \"Saw what?\"</p><br/><p>\"The crack, shadows, weird plants\u2026... the white mountain that you saw just now, did it all disappear in front of your eyes?\" Benjamin asked with an excited look.</p><br/><p>Dick was dumbfounded but still nodded.</p><br/><p>Benjamin nodded, \"That's right!\"</p><br/><p>Dick saw the happy look on his face, it was unbelievable. However, after he gradually came back to his senses, Dick found that the feeling of almost being frozen to death had disappeared.</p><br/><p>This discovery suddenly made him excited.</p><br/><p>At least... he would not be frozen to death.</p><br/><p>\"What the hell is going on?\" After taking a few deep breaths, Dick gradually calmed down and asked. This time, Benjamin seemed to finally be interested enough to answer him.</p><br/><p>\"This is an ice layer that I compressed to ten times its original density, thus, cutting that voice of, which is why we are no longer in that illusion. Everything that you see now is the real world. Skyfall Mountains does not exist, we had just been going around in circles for the past few hours.\"</p><br/><p>Dick was stunned, and his mind was filled with questions.</p><br/><p>...Even though he understood every word that this guy was saying, logically, he could not figure out what he was saying.</p><br/><p>Benjamin, however, could not be bothered to elaborate further. During that brief second in the intangible form, he had continuously condensed the water into ice and eventually formed a soundproof ice hockey ball. After that strange sound was isolated, the illusion had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Even Dick was no longer affected by the illusion, and that was the best proof that it worked.</p><br/><p>So... what do they do now?</p><br/><p>Benjamin lowered his head and looked downwards. The illusions had disappeared, and they had regained the ability to explore freely. However, he soon discovered that the crack was deeper than he had initially thought, as he could not see the bottom of it.</p><br/><p>The System told him that the source of that strange voice came from deeper into the abyss.</p><br/><p>Should they go and have a look?</p><br/><p>\"Why are you hesitating?\" While he was still hesitating, the System snapped. \"You've already controlled the ice hockey ball to go downward, just admit that you want to have a look and stop hesitating.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin scratched his head and smiled nervously.</p><br/><p>He had come across something so incredible, if he were to leave now, he would die of guilt.</p><br/><p>But... wait.</p><br/><p>He did not control the ice hockey ball go downwards.</p><br/><p>When he realized this, Benjamin was shocked.</p><br/><p>Although it was true that he wanted to go and have a look, controlling magic was not something that could be done just by thinking about it. In other words, the one who was controlling that the ice hockey ball to go downwards was not Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014A force was gradually pulling them downwards.</p><br/><p>Benjamin quickly took control of the ice hockey ball. Fortunately, that force was not very strong, the ice hockey ball stopped moving downwards, and gradually began to move upwards again. Benjamin was relieved.</p><br/><p>\"What happened just now? I did not order the ice hockey ball to move downwards.\" He asked in his mind.</p><br/><p>\"Really? I thought you just did not want to admit it, but your magic honestly began to move it downwards.\"</p><br/><p>\"...\"</p><br/><p>\"Do not think too much, maybe it is just gravity.\"</p><br/><p>The System began to crap nonsense and Benjamin felt the need to temporarily ignore it.</p><br/><p>The fact that his magic had automatically moved them downwards was indeed very strange, but after scanning the surroundings, Benjamin felt like there was nothing dangerous here. It was just like the time when he was trying to climb the Skyfall \"mountain\", people rarely die from doing it because after they had given up halfway, the illusion would send them away.</p><br/><p>So, after some consideration, Benjamin choose to ignore Dick who was begging him at the side and instead decided to descend anyway.</p><br/><p>His curiosity was killing him, what would he find at the bottom of this abyss?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

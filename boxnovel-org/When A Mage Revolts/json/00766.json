When the gigantic dragons and the cannonballs collided, a horrifying split was felt in his brain. In the space of consciousness, the combined runes seemed to have been under an extreme pressure and started shaking violently.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Benjamin realized that his spiritual energy was about to suffer a serious depletion.</p><br/><p>However, suddenly, an idea sprung up in his mind.</p><br/><p>\"Activate intangible form.\"</p><br/><p>During that short period of time, he did not have time to think too much; he simply went along with the idea subconsciously screaming in his heart. The logic of this idea was very simple\u2014 after going into intangible form, he could dodge all of the attacks, but what about the damage to his spirit?</p><br/><p>It was obvious that his present state was not too well; if he did not try to resolve the extremely heavy burden on his spiritual energy, then a few more splits might appear in the space of consciousness.</p><br/><p>But, when the System tried to activate the intangible form, something else happened.</p><br/><p>Benjamin felt his consciousness being siphoned out.</p><br/><p>Before his eyes, he still saw the leftover flows of water and the Holy Light, but there was another shadow covering the scene, as though he was watching all these through some broadcasted screen on the side. Also, this feeling... Was familiar to him.</p><br/><p>A broadcasted scene... Where had he seen this before?</p><br/><p>In a daze, Benjamin suddenly had an epiphany, and from the depths of his mind, a memory surged out violently\u2014 he had, in the elemental plane, seen those strange broadcasted scenes before; everything happening in all four corners of the earth were being aggregated into scenes by mysterious lines of light before appearing in the Pure Blue World.</p><br/><p>But, he had only gone into intangible form, why was he suddenly in the elemental plane?</p><br/><p>Benjamin was somewhat confused. But he felt that this was not the real elemental plane; there was no format-like the pure color world and no floating runes or echoing syllables either. This... Seemed to be some sort of interlayer?</p><br/><p>He had one foot in reality, but the other had stepped into the vast expanse of sky in the world of the elemental plane.</p><br/><p>Benjamin could not understand, but regardless, he did not feel so bad after he had arrived here. The splitting feeling, the suffocation... They all vanished along with the siphoning of his consciousness. But, at the same time, he could feel that his body was quick literally turning into a door; there were things in the elemental plane surging into his body continuously, using it as a portal to enter reality.</p><br/><p>As for the absolutely parallel mirror surfaces created by light and water, they seemed to be some products that were resultant of the energy mixing.</p><br/><p>At this, Benjamin felt really amazed.</p><br/><p>Logically, when two great forces collide, a terrible shockwave was bound to be produced. The elements would also lose control and be spread out; it was possible that even Rock City below them would get destroyed. However, at this moment, having seen the two mirror surfaces spread out calmly, a strange energy had wiped away all the agitation within the elements, finally producing a mystifying phenomenon.</p><br/><p>Was this... A higher form of willpower? Or was it purely the law of energy?</p><br/><p>Benjamin wanted to figure out this phenomenon. Unfortunately, the elemental plane did not give him much time.</p><br/><p>A soft clinging sound suddenly sounded from the depths of his heart. At that moment, he suddenly remembered that the System\u2019s time for the intangible form was actually only slightly longer than ten seconds.</p><br/><p>The time seemed to be almost up.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, a dazed Benjamin came back to his senses. He realized that he had already returned to reality. And, to make matters worse, the pain from these ten seconds seemed to have aggregated and surged into in his brain all at once; Benjamin almost fainted on the spot.</p><br/><p>\"I knew it. I knew you were faking your death.\" The System\u2019s voice sounded out emotionlessly, \"The spiritual experience is the same as summer homework- the longer you delay it, the more it accumulates.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin\u2019s body was shivering and he was unable to listen to the System properly.</p><br/><p>In the eyes of the people in Rock City below him, he had suddenly returned from the intangible form with a look of great pain on his face.</p><br/><p>\"Quickly, go and rescue the honorable Director!\"</p><br/><p>Amongst the mages, someone yelled snapping the others back to their senses. But there was some doubt \u2013 they were unsure of whether they should go near to Benjamin at present time.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, right then, something happened.</p><br/><p>Another figure had suddenly appeared next to Benjamin.</p><br/><p>\"I did not think that you would be so stupid as to block all of the cannonballs of Holy Light alone.\" Grant\u2019s expression was somewhat cold, \"What energy did you just borrow? Have you been to the Realm of God?\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin floated in midair, unmoving and silent \u2014The first bout of pain was slowly easing off, but right now, he really did not have any energy to fight Grant.</p><br/><p>Below them, the people of Rock City were observing everything and were completely stunned. Although most people had never seen His Highness the Pope of the Kingdom of Helius with their own eyes, but, judging only by his clothes and the Holy Light surrounding him, the identity of this unexpected guest was undeniable.</p><br/><p>\"We\u2019re f\u2026... finished.\"</p><br/><p>At that moment, even the executive Prime Minister felt his blood curdle.</p><br/><p>He knew that the Pope would personally lead his troops, but he had never imagined that he would appear at such a fatal time!</p><br/><p>There was a commotion in Rock City; there was grief on many of the people\u2019s faces. Outside the city, the soldiers of the Kingdom of Helius had knelt down, their right hands on their chest; there was a subtle excitement on their expressions that was difficult to hide.</p><br/><p>\"His Highness the Pope has appeared at such a perfect time!\" a priest said excitedly, \"This is it, the senseless struggle of these mages should come to an end now.\"</p><br/><p>No matter Icor or the Kingdom of Helius, the heartstrings of the people on both sides were affected by the slightest movement of the two figures in the sky. However, the two main figures were obviously ignoring their audience.</p><br/><p>\u2014At least, Grant did not care.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Benjamin had not replied, he suddenly shook his head and looked somewhat disappointed.</p><br/><p>\"I know you wouldn\u2019t answer, but... It doesn\u2019t matter anymore. This battle should end. You should never have left that key.\"</p><br/><p>Saying this, a rune slowly appeared in his hand, flashing and trembling slightly.</p><br/><p>Benjamin endured the pain and looked coldly at Grant from the corners of his eye.</p><br/><p>Grant continued to speak, \"Somewhat disappointed, right? Cain and Abel, the very similar fated duel of legend, had probably ended in a similar manner. Such a pity, isn\u2019t it? It seems no one can control my destiny...\"</p><br/><p>He seemed to want to say more, but Benjamin suddenly spoke, cutting him off.</p><br/><p>\"Do you think that I didn\u2019t expect you to strike at this opportunity?\"</p><br/><p>Grant was stunned, as though he had realized something. His expression darkened.</p><br/><p>Right at this moment, a third figure appeared out of nowhere. Like a bolt of lightning striking across the clear sky, it crashed straight into Grant!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

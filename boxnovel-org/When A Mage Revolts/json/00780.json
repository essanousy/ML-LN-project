As Benjamin was too close to it, he had no way to avoid it, so he activated the intangible form and let the light thread be as it is shoot through his chest.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Grant followed closely after and charged out from the suppression of the blizzard, a prototype of a second light thread was seen from his hands.</p><br/><p>Everything happened in a very short time frame, the mages around could not even react properly, some of them even looked at Benjamin in shock as they did not know what happened after the light thread went through his chest. Nonetheless, Miles leaped again, waved his dagger and stopped Grant who was flying.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s you again.\"</p><br/><p>After continuous harassment from Miles, Grant was annoyed to the core. However, at that time he had no chance to dodge and could not just accept what was coming, so he put his hand in his pocket and crumpled a cross in a rush.</p><br/><p>Followed by that, he disappeared in the Holy Light and reappeared ten meters away.</p><br/><p>The sudden teleport made Miles failed in his attempt to jump and cut him again. Nevertheless, the other mages reacted then and started attacking one after another. They cast a number of most effective Intermediate Magic, through the siege, they were able to coordinate like they did before and temporarily constrained Grant\u2019s movements.</p><br/><p>\"... Is it finally my turn?\"</p><br/><p>After that, Joanna who had been waiting forever charged out. She flew and arrived behind Grant, then clenched her fist. As her eyes flickered with red runes, raging flames started burning in the sky.</p><br/><p>It was as if she was transformed into a raging fire, in just a few seconds it stretched so far out that it painted the sky and streets red. Around Grant, tens of meters in range were all covered in flames, followed by that, the form of the flames started changing, the blaze intersected with each other and at last, it turned into an earth-shattering phoenix.</p><br/><p>The phoenix flapped its wings and let out soundless cries, instantly, it completely drowned Grant along with his Holy Light!</p><br/><p>Benjamin was standing far away as that happened, he automatically raised his brows.</p><br/><p>Joanna\u2019s powers...seemed to be growing much faster than he had expected. At an age of just over twenty, for her to be able to cast such powerful magic by herself, it was an impossible task for almost all of the mages throughout their lives.</p><br/><p>As he thought about it carefully, her gift and talent was certainly the best that Benjamin had seen throughout his journey. Her ability to summon flames by herself when she was very young was very similar to Grant\u2019s natural Holy Light anomalies, and even after the Mage Academy was built, the supply of her fire element crystal had never stopped since.</p><br/><p>If it wasn\u2019t for the legacy powers of the Church, Grant\u2019s strength at that moment would probably not be far from hers. However, Benjamin also managed to research on the Law of Runes and Meditation, which could offset the difference.</p><br/><p>\"Her gift and talent has always been much higher than yours.\" The System said casually, \"If you had such gifts, you wouldn\u2019t even need to worry about things like the Church, you\u2019ll be able to overthrow him from the start.\"</p><br/><p>Benjamin shook his head helplessly as he did not bother to say anything.</p><br/><p>As he watched the flames before him, honestly other than feeling impressed towards her talents, he was still very much surprised.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t Joanna throw in too much energy in that attack?</p><br/><p>According to the original attack plan, they were supposed to attack in turns, and hold Grant continuously to drain away his spiritual energy, it was the general policy of a wheel-like drawn-out war. But looking at her stance, it did not look like she was draining him, she definitely looked like she was going to kill him in one shot!</p><br/><p>\"Can you probe the situation in the sea of flames now?\" Benjamin could no longer sense anything within the war zone with his water elements, so he could only ask that of the System.</p><br/><p>\"It\u2019s very blurred.\" The System said slowly, \"That girl seemed to have reached a next-level bottleneck, when she attacks...how do I put this, it has a sense of elemental planes? Right now within the sea of flames, a blurry sign is seen from the space limits, the light elements and fire elements should have caused an intense counteract.\"</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that, Benjamin was really very shocked.</p><br/><p>Was that for real...</p><br/><p>He turned around and looked towards the sea of flames in the sky, he had not imagined that Joanna actually had such a trick up her sleeves. Previously when they practiced for coordination, she never mentioned it before.</p><br/><p>Was it possible that the name of \"Light Slayer\" would actually come true?</p><br/><p>Nonetheless, just when the sea of flames burned violently, and nobody knew what was happening inside, the Sun in the sky seemed to have flashed for a while. Instantly, Benjamin could not help but had an illusion, did the Sun become dimmer?</p><br/><p>Quickly after, a beam of light shone down from the layers of clouds that were extremely far away, it was like a light that came from heaven, it slowly shone into the sea of flames.</p><br/><p>Instantly, Benjamin\u2019s heart thumped.</p><br/><p>\"Miles, get her out of there!\"</p><br/><p>He shouted loudly immediately, at the same time, he lifted his right hand and skillfully drew a bunch of runes in the sky.</p><br/><p>Miles was stunned for a while but still entered the sea of flames without hesitation. Benjamin suddenly took out ten over water element crystals and crumbled them with his hand. In a flash, he released a huge amount of water element, which cooperated with the runes and formed a drizzle above the sea of flames.</p><br/><p>\"Elemental Order - Heal.\"</p><br/><p>Gentle rain droplets decended into the sea of flames, it did not affect the flames at all, but went within it quietly and disappeared somewhere where they could not see.</p><br/><p>Sea of flames that burned violently, Holy Light that shone down from the clouds, rain that dropped down from above the sea of flames... In the sky above the streets in Regina, an exceedingly peculiar image was seen.</p><br/><p>In the city, the people had either escaped or were dead, the ones that remained were lesser than a tenth, all of them hid in their own houses and waited in fear for the war to end. However, when there was such a scene in the sky, the people near the streets could not help but bring themselves close to the windowpane and look, astonished.</p><br/><p>Even far away, near the city gates, the armies from Icor and the Kingdom of Helius had reached white-heat, they reflexively hesitated for a few seconds.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, in a trice, the odd image that appeared in the sky above Regina disappeared. Whether it was due to the rain or due to the light, the ferocious sea of flames seemed to have lost its color and its burning power became weaker.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, after a few failed attempts from Miles when he jumped into the flames to search for Joanna, he finally charged out as he carried a person in his arms.</p><br/><p>Benjamin immediately gathered all the healing rain on Joanna.</p><br/><p>\"What a close call, Grant\u2019s light threads that hit her almost turned her lungs into a sieve, luckily it did not strike her heart, or else I\u2019m afraid that even you wouldn\u2019t be able to save her.\" The System sighed as he said.</p><br/><p>When Benjamin watched as Miles saved Joanna, landed and hid away from danger, he could not help but feel relieved.</p><br/><p>Previously, with the aid of the rain that fell into the sea of flames, he could roughly sense what was happening inside. Grant played some tricks and shot out ultimate light threads like a machine gun, which almost cost Joanna her life on the spot. Fortunately, the healing rain entered Joanna\u2019s body at the same time and healed the wounds that appeared.</p><br/><p>In just a few seconds\u2019 time, there were at least hundreds of holes on Joanna\u2019s body, Benjamin had to drag her dying body back and forth from the edge of death for hundreds of time.</p><br/><p>As for Grant, the sea of flames actually did affect him greatly, it forced him to use up a great amount of Holy Light for defense, and even weakened his accuracy. Finally, Miles managed to find Joanna\u2019s location in the sea of flames, so he ignored the directionless light threads around him and saved her from the mess.</p><br/><p>\"All you mages are so crazy.\" After Miles landed beside Benjamin and gently laid down Joanna who was in a coma, he complained.</p><br/><p>Benjamin showed an innocent look and shrugged.</p><br/><p>\"Elemental Order - Damage.\"</p><br/><p>He did not talk to Miles, but after confirming that Joanna was alright, he quickly wiped away the runes before, then drew out new ones from his finger.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

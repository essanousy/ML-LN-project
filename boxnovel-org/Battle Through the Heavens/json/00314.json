Now you want to just leave empty handed?\u201d Hai Bo Dong finally could not resist opening his mouth to speak as his toes pressed gently against the rooftops.</p><br/><p>On one side, Jia Lao also nodded his head. With his character, he would naturally not leave empty handed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn what way is this empty handed? Don\u2019t we already know the true identity of that fellow? Now, we at least have some foundation in our hearts.\u201d Clearly knowing Hai Bo Dong\u2019s and Jia Lao\u2019s bad mood, Fa Ma could only helplessly shake his head as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat use is there to just know? Won\u2019t he still participate in the competition tomorrow? With that ability of his and his many years of experience refining pills, becoming the champion will not be very hard for him.\u201d Jia Lao knit his eyebrows together as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, don\u2019t we still have Yan Xiao and the two other little fellows? Who among the three of them doesn\u2019t have some trump cards? There might be something unexpected that will happen tomorrow.\u201d Fa Ma glanced at Xiao Yan behind him before saying with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou stop pretending to be muddled. Yan Xiao and the other two little fellows may have quite great talent, but that fellow is after all the deputy chairman of the Chu Yun Empire\u2019s Alchemist Association. Moreover, he has come prepared this time around. The chances of the three of them obtaining victory is very small.\u201d Jia Lao said in a deep voice, \u201cIf that fellow were to become the champion, not only will your association\u2019s reputation decline greatly, but the Jia Ma Empire will also be ridiculed in the continent for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most important thing is that once he becomes the champion, that fellow will increasingly become the focus of attention. When that time comes, it would be very problematic even if you wanted to kill him along the way.\u201d Hai Bo Dong added.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was behind everyone, quietly listening to the three people argue in front of him. He understood clearly that it was best not to interrupt at such an instance.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know the ability of that girl Yue-er? Although obtaining the top three may not be considered too difficult, there would still be some difficulty for her to become champion even without the sudden appearance of that fellow. As for Liu Ling, he has indeed learned many things from Gu He, but he loses out in terms of age and his experience is far from that of Yan Li.\u201d Jia Lao frowned as he analyzed the situation , \u201cAmong the three of them, only Yan Xiao can barely contend with that fellow. However, I can be certain that Yan Li had hidden a lot of his ability today. In the final round of the competition tomorrow, I\u2019m afraid that Yan Xiao will end up at a disadvantage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fa Ma was quiet. His face was volatile and his eyes repeatedly flickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Old Man Fa, you should think of some solutions. That fellow\u2019s participation in the competition is already against the rules so you need not bother continuing to guard those useless things. Just do what you need to do. All is well if you don\u2019t let that fellow become champion.\u201d Hai Bo Dong sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu.\u201d Fa Ma heaved a long sigh and inhaled some of the somewhat icy cool night air. His moving speed suddenly slowed down as he nodded slightly and whispered, \u201cThat\u2019s right. We should do something. The tradition of the Jia Ma Empire\u2019s Alchemist Association has lasted for so many years and cannot be discredited in my hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, it\u2019s good that you know this.\u201d Seeing Fa Ma finally opening his mouth, Hai Bo Dong and Jia Lao also sighed in relief as they both spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>Fa Ma frowned for a moment before suddenly turning around. He eyed Xiao Yan, smiled and said, \u201cLittle fellow, the strength that you have displayed today is not your limit, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan was momentarily at a loss. He raised his head and looked at the smiling Fa Ma before replying hesitatingly, \u201cOld Fa, why are you asking this? I have indeed hid a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, I just knew it. Why is it that all the young people these days like to play it this way?\u201d Fa Ma laughed out loud. He then let himself fall back, patted Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders and smiled yet again as he said, \u201cDuring this Grand Meeting, I\u2019m afraid that I will have to rely on you to fight for the champion spot with Yan Li.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Fa must be joking. Although I do not like to say good things about the other person, you should also know that the fellow is a deputy chairman of an association. An inexperienced young fellow like me will have great difficulty surpassing him.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally, we cannot simply rely entirely on you. Since that fellow broke the rules first, then I cannot be blamed.\u201d Fa Ma smiled faintly and said. Immediately, he threw his gaze toward Hai Bo Dong and Jia Lao, \u201cBoth of you should return first. I will bring young friend Yan Xiao back to the association, There are some things that I need to discuss with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Fa Ma\u2019s words, Hai Bo Dong and Jia Lao were at a loss. They immediately exchanged a glance and nodded slightly. After which, they cupped their hands toward Fa Ma before they headed to the east and west respectively, disappearing from Xiao Yan\u2019s sight in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan watched the two of them disappear and turned his gaze toward Fa Ma. In an uncertain voice, he asked, \u201cOld Fa, what are you planning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, follow me.\u201d Fa Ma smiled, moved his body and flashed toward the middle of the city where the Alchemist Association was located. Behind him, Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before following closely.</p><br/><p>With one person at the front and one at the back, the two of them quickly flew through the city sky. Ten minutes later, they stopped at the Alchemist Association without alerting anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Fa Ma said to Xiao Yan before leading the way into the interior of the association.</p><br/><p>Although it was currently late in the night, the Alchemist Association was still brightly lit, making it appear like daytime. At the entrance, cold looking guards were monitoring everyone entering and exiting without knowing what being tired meant. When their gazes suddenly swept over an old man who was striding toward the association, they were first startled before their bodies immediately and abruptly tensed. Their eyes were filled with respect and reverence as they stared at Fa Ma who was slowly walking over.</p><br/><p>Fa Ma smiled carelessly at the guards at the door. He turned around and hastened Xiao Yan before lifting his legs and walking into the association.</p><br/><p>Hearing Fa Ma hurrying him, Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. He immediately followed closely under the surprised gazes of those guards. Since they had first become guards at this place, they had not seen Fa Ma treat a young person in this manner before.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan walked into the association and followed Fa Ma as he swiftly passed through a few large rooms. During this period, the many alchemists, who saw Fa Ma, displayed a reverence on their faces as they bowed and retreated to one side. Following beside Fa Ma, Xiao Yan borrowed Fa Ma\u2019s glory and enjoyed this kind of treatment.</p><br/><p>When the two of them walked up the stairs, those alchemist within the large hall immediately began to whisper privately among themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat young person appears to be that Yan Xiao from the Grand Meeting today, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like the chairman views him with great importance.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChe, what unnecessary words. He is one of the few people who can compete with that gray robed young man from the Chu Yun Empire. Would he not be paid attention to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he is able to become champion this time around, he would likely become the youngest Elder of the Jia Ma Empire\u2019s Alchemist Association, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, most heroes are born young. The old me has muddled on for an entire lifetime in order to merely obtain a supervisor level in the association.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan followed Fa Ma all the way until the highest floor of the association before stopping outside a room. Fa Ma then pushed opened the door and entered while Xiao Yan followed behind. The latter\u2019s gaze swept around and he felt a little astonished. The room\u2019s size was very spacious, but it appeared somewhat old fashioned. A few bookshelves leaned against the walls and an ancient looking table stood alone in the middle of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake a seat.\u201d Fa Ma sat down behind the table and said with a smile toward Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded his head and carelessly drew out the chair before sitting down. He quietly stared at the smiling Fa Ma and it was a while later when he finally spoke with a smile, \u201cOld Fa, if you have something to say, please do. If it is within my ability to help, I, Yan Xiao will not refuse you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I think you can also guess that the main reason for me asking you to come over is to talk about helping you become champion.\u201d Fa Ma smiled and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also really hope to take the champion spot. but\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled bitterly and waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Fa Ma nodded his head. He fondled his beard and voiced his thoughts, \u201cDuring the competition round tomorrow, there\u2019s not much trick to the examination question. One basically has to rely on one\u2019s own ability and trump cards.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that round of the competition, free reign is completely given. All the things, including the medicinal ingredients must be prepared by oneself. In other words, it means that in the examination tomorrow, the association will not give any medicinal formula. The competitors must rely on their own collection and go to the limits of their abilities to find suitable medicinal ingredients. At the same time, assuming that you have prepared a medicinal formula, you must also have the sufficient ingredients in order to refine the medicinal pill. If you don\u2019t have it, then you can only consider yourself unlucky.\u201d Fa Ma waved his hand as he spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth opened slowly. Some time later, he could not resist letting out a curse. If he did not have Fa Ma to reveal the information before hand, the highest tier medicinal formula that he could refine during the examination tomorrow would be those tier three medicinal formulas that Yao Lao had occasionally transmitted to him. However, a medicinal formula of this tier would clearly be very difficult to win against Yan Li, Little Princess and Liu Ling, whose collections were incomparably vast.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough this kind of examination had a part which leaned toward luck, luck is also one kind of ability. Therefore\u2026\u201d Fa Ma smiled and continued, \u201cAccording to my prediction, that Yan Li should have a tier four medicinal formula in his collection. With his identity as the deputy chairman, he should have the ingredients completely prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTier four? With his ability, he should be able to refine a tier five medicinal pill, right?\u201d Xiao Yan frowned and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes he can, but the chances of failure are too high. Therefore, it is clearly unsuitable for this kind of competition.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut even if it is a tier four, it looks like there\u2019s nothing I can do. I\u2019m not afraid of you laughing at me for being shabby, but the medicinal formulas I have on me that are within my ability to refine are only at most a tier three. What\u2019s more, many of the medicinal ingredients are not completely prepared.\u201d Xiao Yan sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I was able to guess this.\u201d Fa Ma smiled and nodded his head. He eyed Xiao Yan and said, \u201cI have called you over naturally because I need to to win over Yan Li. Thus, I can help you solve the problem regarding medicinal formula and ingredients. However, this is only on the premise of you being confident to refine it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I need to roughly see what tier the medicinal formula is and what its requirements are.\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Yan felt somewhat secretly pleased. With the wealth of the Alchemist Association, the medicinal formula that would be taken out would definitely not be anything ordinary. If he were able to get his hands on it for free, it was naturally a windfall.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe medicinal formula will definitely not disappoint you. This medicinal formula may only be tier four, but if one were to talk about its value, it would certainly not be lower than that of a tier five medicinal formula. It might even surpass it.\u201d Fa Ma smiled faintly, stood up and walked behind the bookshelves. After a while, he carried a scroll that was as black as ink as he slowly walked out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, take a look. I think that you should like it.\u201d Fa Ma rubbed the ancient surface of the scroll and handed it over to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan received the scroll with both hands and carefully pulled it open. His gaze slowly scanned the little information that was recorded on the surface of the scroll. A while later, he gently inhaled a breath of cool air.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s far too valuable.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

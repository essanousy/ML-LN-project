Powerful Dou Qi swarmed out from within the bodies of the two of them, and rippled throughout the entire hall.</p><br/><p>On a chair in one corner of the hall, Xun Er was smiling as she watched the two figures. When she heard the sound of footsteps, she suddenly turned around and eyed Xiao Yan, who was climbing down the stairs. She could not help but hurriedly move forward to greet him. In a gentle voice, she smiled and asked, \u201cXiao Yan ge-ge are you awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He faced the two people in the hall and asked with a smile, \u201cWhat are those two fellows doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps it\u2019s because of this \u2018Hunting Competition.\u2019 When they were training last night, Wu Hao and Hu Jia each advanced to a seven star Da Dou Shi one after the other. They wanted to spar when they woke up in the morning. Hence\u2026\u201d Xun Er covered her mouth and explained with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? They have advanced?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lifted his eyebrows when he heard this. He immediately sighed and shook his head. These two fellows were worthy of being the top among Jia Nan Academy\u2019s Outer Academy. Their talent far exceeded that of an ordinary person. If one were to just discuss training talent, they would even be on the same level as Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Xun Er? What is your level now?\u201d Xiao Yan turned his head over, threw his gaze toward Xun Er as he questioned with a smile. This girl had demonstrated training talent that caused even him to be amazed at. When he had left Wu Tan City, Xun Er was merely a Dou Zhe. Now, after only over two years time, she was already at the Da Dou Shi level. This kind of speed was something that he would likely have difficulty catching up to if he did not have Yao Lao\u2019s help. Moreover, Xun Er was even younger than Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? I am also at the seven star Da Dou Shi level now. However, after this \u2018Fire Energy Hunting Competition,\u2019 I have been feeling that I am close to advancing. I think that within three or four days, I should be able to successfully become an eight star Da Dou Shi.\u201d Xun Er lifted the teacup beside her, sipped shallowly and smiled as she replied to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, one after another\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan could not help but click his tongue. It appeared that all of the people in this small, four man group were not ordinary people. All of them had shocking talent and great potential. Moreover, Xiao Yan dared to say that all three of them had their own hidden abilities and trump cards. If they were to meet an extremely dangerous situation, the strength that would erupt from them shock people. He did not have any doubt when it came to this matter. After all, Hu Jia\u2019s grandfather was the Outer Academy\u2019s Deputy Headmaster with a strength that was near the peak of the Dou Huang class. Toward his only granddaughter, he would naturally not hold back when teaching her.</p><br/><p>According to what Instructor Ruo Ling and the others had said, the person behind Wu Hao appeared to be the commander of the Law Enforcement Unit. This unit was basically the armed forces of the Jia Nan Academy. Usually, they focused on handling diabolical and fierce people who originated from the \u2018Black Corner Region.\u2019 By being able to become the commander of such a unit, it was likely that his strength was not much weaker than Deputy Headmaster Hu Gan.</p><br/><p>There was even less need to talk about Xun Er. Even until now, Xiao Yan was still uncertain of the enormous faction behind her. Of course, from the somewhat fearsome tone of Yao Lao, he could vaguely sense the huge outline.</p><br/><p>With the background of the three of them, Xiao Yan did not think that the trump cards that they possessed would be much weaker than his own. Since he could rely on the Secret Technique to defeat an elite Dou Ling, it was likely that they would also be able to do something similar, no?</p><br/><p>\u201cBang, bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Xiao Yan was sighing endlessly over the strength of this small group of his, a hurried knocking sound suddenly sounded from the door in an untimely fashion.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lifted his head uncertainly. His gaze swept toward the front door and Xun Er obediently stood up and swiftly walked over. Wu Hao and Hu Jia had ceased sparing when they heard the knock. They grabbed the towels beside them and wiped off their perspiration. After which, they walked over to Xiao Yan\u2019s side, lifted the teacups on the table, and swallowed the tea in one gulp.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Wu Hao asked vaguely after drinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will know once we take a look.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled, and lifted his head only to see Xun Er, who had opened the door and conversed with the person outside for awhile, swiftly walking back.</p><br/><p>\u201cXun Er, what is it?\u201d Hu Jia smiled and asked Xun Er a question as she tied a purple belt around her pretty waist, illustrating her already delicate and narrow waist, until it was even more alluring.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are dozens of new students outside saying that they want to meet Xiao Yan ge-ge.\u201d Xun Er knit her eyebrows slightly as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cNew students? Is there something wrong? Forget it, let them in.\u201d Xiao Yan was slightly startled before he immediately replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er nodded her head when she heard this. She beckoned with her hand to the area outside the door. Immediately, more than ten figures swarmed in and came over, surrounding Xiao Yan\u2019s group. For some unknown reason, their faces were all flushed red.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Xiao Yan. Being a fellow new student, you must definitely help us. The older students in this Inner Academy have really gone too far.\u201d It was a young man, whose face was somewhat flushed in agitation. Xiao Yan still remembered that this young man was one of the three people who was still standing after matching up against that single \u2018Black Demon Group\u2019 member in that match with the \u2018Black Demon Group\u2019 during the \u2018Hunting Competition.\u2019 If he recalled correctly, his name was Atai.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened? Tell me clearly.\u201d Xiao Yan frowned and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cStarting from this morning, some older student groups entered the new students\u2019 area, shouting all the while. They wanted to collect what they called the New Student Tribute Fee, which is 2 days\u2019 worth of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 per person\u2026 We also know that as a newcomer, there is no need to act too sharply. It is alright if we just endured a little. Thus, we did not say anything and handed the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 payment to them. In the end, it is unexpected that after we dispatched that group of people, even more older student groups came one after another, repeatedly barging into our new students\u2019 area. They blocked the exit and are now asking us to pay again. Until now, three groups have already arrived. If this continues, the little \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 that us new students have obtained after fighting desperately with Senior will have been completely taken away!\u201d The young man named Atai clenched his teeth and spoke resentfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t these people going too overboard?\u201d Hu Jia\u2019s pretty face sunk slightly as her delicate hand heavily slammed down on the armrest of a chair.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan held a teacup with both hands. His eyes narrowed, but he did not open his mouth to say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Xiao Yan, we have come to look for you, not because we want you to help exempt us from such harassment. We also understand that as new students of the Inner Academy, it is unavoidable to be bullied by the older students. I have also inquired with some friends. In previous years, the new students needed to pay a little of this so-called \u2018New Student Tribute Fee,\u2019 but it was not like what is happening to us now, where one group after another came. From what that friend of mine said, the reason for things being as such this year was because the performance of the new students in the \u2018Fire Energy Hunting Competition\u2019 caused some older students\u2019 hearts to be in a bad mood. Thus, this kind of new situation has appeared.\u201d Atai laughed bitterly and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy saying all of these things, I am not blaming Senior Xiao Yan. You have lead us to avoid being suppressed and bullied by the older students during the \u2018Fire Energy Hunting Competition.\u2019 The reputation of Senior Xiao Yan is now the highest in the hearts of this year\u2019s new students. Hence, we can only request that you step forward now that we have met such a troublesome situation. Hopefully, this can allow us new students to conclude these layers upon layers of exploitation. Otherwise, if we do not even have enough training payment to enter the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019, how are we even going to discuss training in the Inner Academy then?\u201d Atai stared intently at Xiao Yan as he continued, \u201cIf it is really not possible, we, new students, would rather hand over that so called \u2018New Students Tribute Fee\u2019 to Senior Xiao Yan instead of giving it to those bastards!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me the \u2018New Students Tribute Fee?\u2019 Won\u2019t that mix me into a class similar to those older students?\u201d Xiao Yan smiled faintly. His finger gently tapped on his teacup, emitting a clear sound. After musing for a while, he smiled and said to Atai, \u201cSince those older students are blocking the exit and collecting the tribute, I think that the few of us will not fall between the gaps. Why don\u2019t we do this? You will go and gather all the new students. We will hurry over immediately.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, Senior Xiao Yan, thank you very much. If you are in need of assistance in the future, this batch of new students will gladly listen to Senior Xiao Yan\u2019s orders!\u201d Hearing this, Atai and the ten plus new students following him immediately rejoiced. They hurriedly bowed to Xiao Yan and quickly exited the hall of the pavilion house.</p><br/><p>After seeing the new students leave, Xiao Yan turned his head, eyed Xun Er and the two others and asked, \u201cHow do you all see this matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the group leader, you make the decisions. However, we cannot just be some unresisting lamb that allows those people to bully, right?\u201d Hu Jia frowned and said, \u201cMoreover, if you do not bother to intervene in this situation, the reputation, that you have accumulated among these new students with great difficulty, might perhaps immediately collapse, and you would lose a great deal of people\u2019s support.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Su said yesterday that there are many scattered factions within the Inner Academy. In the future, if we want to stay here for a long time, just the four of us may perhaps be a little weak. Now\u2026 is a good chance to draw people in. By relying on your reputation among the new students, as long as you dare to lead and take the risk of being beaten, there would perhaps be around eighty or ninety percent of the new students willing to follow you.\u201d Xun Er voiced her thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want us to form our own faction?\u201d Xiao Yan was a little astonished as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would ultimately be better than joining someone else\u2019s faction\u2026 it is just like you said earlier. It should also be difficult for us to escape paying that so called \u2018Tribute Fee.\u2019 Since this is the case, why don\u2019t we gather everyone together. Although the strength of the new students is a little weak now, if we add up a few dozen of us, an ordinary small group would, at the very least, not dare to come and harass us again. No matter how one puts it, it would save us a lot of trouble.\u201d Xun Er spread her hands and smiled as she explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat Xun Er said could work. Rather than letting the new students assimilate into other factions, why don\u2019t we try to gather them all together, and let them work for us.\u201d Wu Hao nodded slightly and agreed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan knit his brows tightly. His hands repeatedly rubbed the teacup. Seeing his deep in thought appearance, Xun Er and the other two did not dare to speak or interrupt him. They merely quietly waited for his decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The silence continued for a couple of minutes before Xiao Yan finally let out a long sigh. He stood up and said in a deep voice, \u201cAlright, I will do as you guys have suggested! Now is the best opportunity to rope in the new students. Once we lose this opportunity, it would be ten times more difficult if we wanted to rope them in in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he said these words, Xiao Yan waved his hand and strode out the front door. Xun Er and the other two exchanged glances with each other before immediately smiling and following Xiao Yan with swift footsteps.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It seemed that he was aware of some information that was related to the Gu clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle friend Xiao Yan, why have you suddenly mentioned the Gu clan? Don\u2019t tell me that you have a conflict with them?\u201d Jin Shi also gradually recovered a moment later and spoke with some worry. This Gu clan was not the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Xiao Yan might still be able to live happily even after offending the Wind Lightning Pavilion. However, if he were to form an enmity with this mysterious Gu clan, the result\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shook his head and smiled as he said, \u201cI have never met this Gu clan. How could there be any conflict? It is just that I wish to know some information related to this Gu clan. Is it possible for elder Jin Shi to tell me about them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shi sighed in relief. He wiped off the cold sweat on his forehead as he said, \u201cIt is best if this is the case. Throughout the Central Plains region, the human\u2019s \u2018Hall of Souls,\u2019 and Pill Hall or the three great ancient families in the Magical Beast world fear this Gu clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also felt slightly startled when he heard this. Although he was able to guess that Xun Er\u2019s background was not weak, he did not expect that the so-called Gu clan was actually this strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it that I have never heard of this Gu clan? Moreover, this clan has never appeared among the humans nor Magical Beast factions. Could it be that they do not belong to either one?\u201d Xiao Yan asked uncertainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cStrictly speaking, this Gu clan could be considered human. However\u2026 they are descendants from the ancient times. It is rumored that they possessed the bloodline of a Dou Di.\u201d Jin Shi slowly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bloodline of a Dou Di?\u201d Xiao Yan was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is rumored that if a person is able to reach the Dou Di class, their bloodline will undergo a change. His descendants will benefit as a result. There were quite a number of Dou Di clans in the ancient times. Although they could be considered humans, they possessed a rich talent when it came to training. Some of those who were lucky might even inherit some Dou Di\u2019s abilities through their bloodline. However, such a thing is extremely rare and will completely depend on one\u2019s luck.\u201d Jin Shi nodded. His tone contained a respect that was difficult to hide when he mentioned the words Dou Di. This was a respect for the strongest people in the world.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese clans that possess an ancient Dou Di bloodline greatly discriminate against outsiders. Due to them needing to maintain the purity of their bloodline, even if they were to marry an ordinary human, they would definitely choose an extremely outstanding person.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere were quite a number of clans in the ancient times who possessed the bloodline of a Dou Di. However, with the flow of time, it seems that hardly any remained. The survivors are called the extremely mysterious Gu clan..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Gu Clan doesn\u2019t care much for the ranking on the continent but its strength is without doubt. There are many experts in the clan and speaking truthfully, there are very few factions in the continent that can contend against it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head. It was no wonder that Xun Er told him that he had to wait until he was a Dou Zong before he could go and try to find her. So the Gu Clan was actually this scary. Thinking of the strength of the Hall of Souls, even they were afraid of the Gu Clan. How terrifying was the strength of this Gu Clan?</p><br/><p>\u201cThen does elder Jin Shi know where the headquarters of the Gu Clan is?\u201d Xiao Yan paused before asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe eastern region of the Central Plains basically belongs to the Gu clan. Other than a few of them, the many various fractions there are all vassals of the Gu clan. However, the Gu clan seldom manages them. Usually, most of the people of the Gu clan all live in the \u2018Gu Realm\u2019.\u201d Jin Shi continued to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cGu Realm?\u201d Xiao Yan was once again startled when he heard these unfamiliar words.</p><br/><p>\u201cAny experts who reach the Dou Sheng class are basically standing on the peak of the Dou Qi continent. At this level, one would have already surpassed the ordinary and would have stepped into the holy level. The strength that one would possess would naturally be far from what an ordinary person can imagine. Opening a realm where people could live is an indicator of an elite Dou Sheng.\u201d Jin Shi sighed. His voice contained extreme envy. \u201cThis Gu Realm is built from the extremely strong Dou Shengs of the Gu clan over the generations. After a countless number of years of strengthening and expanding, its size could at the very least be comparable to the northern region of the Central Plains even if it cannot be compared with the entire Central Plains region. That place is uniquely owned by the people of the Gu clan. Hence, the ordinary people from the Central Plains do not really understand it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently inhaled a breath of cold air. Opening a realm. Was such a frightening thing really something that a person\u2019s strength could achieve? An elite Dou Sheng was so powerful it ended up making one feel disbelief? Xiao Yan felt himself tremble when he thought of the frightening strength that could tear space apart with just the lift of a hand.</p><br/><p>This was already the case for an elite Dou Sheng. Then just how terrifying was the even stronger Dou Di?</p><br/><p>By comparing the two, the mysterious ability of an elite Dou Di being able to change their bloodline mentioned by Jin Shi did not appear to be some cooked up story.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven I am not certain on how one enters this Gu Realm. If not for the many members of my Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe, it is likely that I would be far from qualified to be aware of so many secrets given my strength.\u201d Jin Shi shook his head and spoke somewhat regretfully.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. He was also satisfied by learning so much information related to the Gu clan. Although the Gu clan\u2019s strength was extremely great, he would definitely break into that place for Xun Er even if it was extremely dangerous.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan was uncertain how many experts were within the Gu clan, it was likely that there would not be any less than that of the \u2018Hall of Souls.\u2019 Xiao Yan\u2019s strength was insufficient even though he had currently broken through to the Dou Zong class. However, this did not become an obstruction to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce I rescue Yao Lao, I will head to that Gu clan. Regardless of how special you are, you are ultimately humans!\u201d Xiao Yan clenched his teeth and spoke viciously in his heart. He did not feel any fear just because of the great strength behind the Gu clan. Xun Er had waited for him for so many years. Regardless of the situation, he needed to make a trip there. Otherwise, he was heartless.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like I should quickly expel the fire poison in Jin Shi. The Four Pavilion Grand Meeting that Mu Qing Luan had mentioned is about to begin. If I miss it, I don\u2019t know just when it will be before I can find Feng zun-zhe\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Jin Gu efficiency had somewhat exceeded Xiao Yan\u2019s expectation. Before noon time, all the things that Xiao Yan needed were delivered into his hands.</p><br/><p>A fog floated within a rock house on the slopes of a mountain. The fog contained waves of dense medicinal fragrance and a transpiring heat.</p><br/><p>There was a large wooden basin within the rock house. Jin Shi was seated within the wooden basin, and boiling water covered his body up to his neck. He was unable to use Dou Qi to block the temperature. Hence, Jin Shi\u2019s face was filled with perspiration.</p><br/><p>A jade-green flame was swiftly writhing on Xiao Yan\u2019s hand just beside the wooden basin. There were numerous medicinal ingredients mixed with it. A moment later, it transformed into a drop of a fiery-red medicinal liquid. With a flick of his finger, the medicinal liquid fell into the basin. The surface of the water immediately turned red as many fiery-red bubbles churned within it.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsume this medicinal pill.\u201d A medicinal pill shot out from Xiao Yan\u2019s Storage Ring before being suspended in front of Jin Shi. He sucked it and swallowed it into his body.</p><br/><p>When the medicinal pill entered his body, a bone-chilling coldness immediately began to spread out, covering every single inch of his body. At the same time, the medicinal strength within the hot red-colored liquid within the basin seeped into his body from every pore. Amid this clash between cold and hot, drops of a grayish liquid, that contained a stenc, slowly seeped out of Jin Shi\u2019s nose.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss hiss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shi\u2019s body intensely trembled as the fishy gray liquid seeped out. His teeth were tightly clenched together as his mouth emitted a hissing voice. Clearly, he was suffering an extremely intense pain during the process of forcing the poison out.</p><br/><p>Jin Gu by the side also became anxious when he saw Jin Shi\u2019s painful expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to be anxious. It is only a normal pain. Everything will be fine if he can endure for a while.\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s face was calm. He waved his hand and a cluster of jade-green flames fell from it. After which, it landed in the wooden basin, and the temperature of the fire-red liquid swiftly rose.</p><br/><p>Jin Shi\u2019s face was like burning charcoal following the swift increase in the water\u2019s temperature. The air that he exhaled was hot. His appearance caused Jin Gu, who was watching by the side, to feel numb. If the fire poison was not being forced out, he would have wondered if Xiao Yan was planning on murdering Jin Shi\u2026</p><br/><p>With the rise of the flame, an increasing amount of gray-colored liquid seeped out of Jin Shi\u2019s body. However, with the combustion of the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, the fire poison was swiftly incinerated the moment they appeared. Thus, the purity of the medicinal strength in the wooden basin was maintained.</p><br/><p>This method of using ice and fire to expel the poison continued for nearly eight hours. Only then did it end because of the exhaustion of the medicinal strength within the wooden basin. However, it must be said that the fire poison was indeed deposited too deeply within Jin Shi\u2019s body. Xiao Yan was unable to completely remove it from the root despite having used this method.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to this speed, it should be possible to expel most of the fire poison in your body within five days. At that time, I will refine some medicinal liquid for you. As long as you soak in it for two to three hours everyday for two to three months, the fire poison in your body will be completely removed.\u201d Xiao Yan pulled away the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 and spoke after seeing Jin Shi stand up from the wooden basin to put on his clothes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you mister Xiao Yan. Our Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe will definitely not forget this favor. If there is anything that requires our help in the future, you can come and look for the old me on the Heaven Eye Mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shi solemnly bowed to Xiao Yan as he spoke in a deep voice. He could sense the change in his body. A disease that had been with him for so many years could finally be expelled. Currently, his heart was quite excited.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan beamed. He looked at Jin Shi, whose spirit was much better. His hand suddenly rubbed his chest. There seemed to be quite a frightening poison also present within his body, the Demon Poison Spot\u2026 this thing had also pestered him for many years. Although he had yet to find an elite Dou Zun, Xiao Yan had already advanced to the Dou Zong class. His ability to resist it had also significantly risen.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if I am able to rely on my strength to refine this Demon Poison Spot with my current ability. If I am able to obtain the Dou Qi from a Dou Zong\u2019s lifetime, it would likely be a great tonic to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart involuntarily became heated when he thought of this. His intention to deal with the Demon Poison Spot was not something that he had been thinking about for just one or two days\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

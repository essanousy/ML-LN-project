After which, he turned his head and looked at the many gazes around him. He involuntarily became a little embarrassed. Immediately, he let out a dry cough and laughed, \u201cIf you had been more precise with your control of the flame when you had refined the medicinal pill and had lengthened the time that you use to form the pill, the quality of this Sky Qi Pill would have been a little better. Therefore, I could not help but say that it\u2019s a pity.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding people involuntarily turned into an uproar when they saw that Xiao Yan had taught this blue-clothed lady a lesson in such an unceremonious manner. They gaze were immediately stunned as they looked at this bold fellow. The number of people who were qualified to give the latter an opinion did not exceed five. Moreover, these five were mostly the Elders from the Alchemy Department. This black-robed man, who appeared quite young, clearly was not among them.</p><br/><p>The blue-clothed lady on the platform was also stunned because of Xiao Yan\u2019s words. Although she faintly sensed that the quality of the medicinal pill might be better if she did as Xiao Yan had said, she was still a somewhat cold and proud character. If the other party was an Elder from the Alchemist Department, she might be inclined to carefully listen and learn. However, Xiao Yan\u2019s age clearly appeared to be similar to hers. Therefore, it made it difficult for her to accept his advice. Her pretty face had also turned somewhat ugly, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that the act of simply saying some random words actually depends on who one is? If you feel that what I just said is wrong, you can simply choose to ignore it.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled slightly and casually replied.</p><br/><p>Xin Lan was momentarily at a loss after hearing these calm words by Xiao Yan. She was clearly dull. There were very few people in the Inner Academy who would speak to her in this manner. She immediately grit her silver teeth slightly and said, \u201cThis is the headquarters of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019. Only \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 members are allowed to enter. You are randomly walking around without even wearing a badge. This is against the rules. Which subsection are you attached to?\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing Xin Lan\u2019s words, the surrounding members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 had also discovered that Xiao Yan was not wearing a badge. Their gazes immediately became much more cautious. \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 had a strict rule that those who were walking within it must wear a badge. This rule was something that all of the members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 knew. Hence, there would seldom be a matter similar to what was happening now.After all, the current \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 was no longer as loose as it was back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have come to look for someone.\u201d Xiao Yan was somewhat helpless as he sensed those cautious gazes. Having not returned to the Inner Academy for two years, he had not expected to actually be faced with such an embarrassing interrogation.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooking for someone? If an outsider enters the \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 to search for someone, there must be someone escorting them. Randomly barging in will not end being a good thing.\u201d Xin Lin walked down the tall platform and immediately carried a faint serene fragrance as she appeared in front of Xiao Yan. Her eyes swept over the latter\u2019s face. That familiar feeling became even denser. Even her originally cold tone had warmed a little. \u201cYou should be careful next time. Who are you looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHu Jia and Wu Hao. Ask them to come and see me.\u201d Xiao Yan rubbed his head and smiled as he responded.</p><br/><p>Xin Lan and the surrounding people\u2019s face involuntarily became somewhat strange after hearing his words. Currently, Wu Hao and Hu Jia\u2019s position within the Inner Academy were extraordinary. Even the members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 seldom got to see them. Yet, this black-robed, young man had actually opened his mouth and asked those two to come out and see him?</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Hu Jia and Senior Wu Hao are usually extremely busy. It is not easy to see them. Moreover, you are not the only one in the Inner Academy who wishes to see the two of them.\u201d Xin Lan shook her head. Her delicate hand parted the black hair in front of her forehead as she spoke in a calm tone. She was currently treating Xiao Yan as an ordinary student who had secretly snuck into \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate.\u2019 It was not the first time that such a person had appeared.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed bitterly upon hearing these words from Xin Lan. He immediately lifted his feet and walked toward the crowd. The people parted as he did so and a young lady wearing a red-colored dress stood in a transfixed manner. A pair of large watery eyes stared intently at the black-robed, young man who was walking over.</p><br/><p>The young lady was wearing a red dress and had a figure that would not be considered tall. Instead, it gave one the feeling of being small and beautiful. Of course, despite the size of the young lady, who appeared small and lovely, her voluminous chest would rarely be seen. Her exquisite face emitted a tread of alluring enchantment amid its purity. This prettiness was not much poorer than that blue-clothed lady. This could be seen from the admiring looks that were repeatedly shot over.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s footsteps paused in front of the red-dressed, young lady. He looked at her face which had descended into a dull state after having seen him and involuntarily smiled. Immediately, he extended his hand and patted the latter\u2019s head in front of everyone\u2019s stunned gazes before speaking with a smile, \u201cYou have grown quite a bit in the two years that we have not met.\u201d</p><br/><p>The lady was suddenly woken up by Xiao Yan\u2019s somewhat affectionate action. She looked at the warm smile on the latter\u2019s face and moisture immediately churned in her large watery eyes. Two crystal clear tears flowed down her face and fell. Ever since that matter back then, the person in front of her seemed to never show such affectionate action toward her\u2026</p><br/><p>The young lady, whose eyes had suddenly revealed a moistness, immediately stirred the fury of the surrounding flower protectors. Numerous furious gazes quickly shot toward Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Mei, what happened to you? Are you alright?\u201d A blue-colored figure swiftly appeared beside the red-dress-wearing, young lady. She hurriedly inquired after seeing her pear blossom in a rain-like manner. At the same time, she stared at Xiao Yan while her eyebrows became vertical. She was just about to reprimand when she was held back by Xiao Mei. A timid voice was immediately transmitted from behind her.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao\u2026 cousin brother Xiao Yan. Is that really you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xin Lan involuntarily knit her eyebrows after being held back by Xiao Mei. She was just about to speak when her expression slowly solidified. Her pure pretty eyes widened as she looked at the black-robed, young man in front of her in a stunned manner, \u201cXiao\u2026 Xiao Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cousin brother Xiao Yan?</p><br/><p>Everyone present knew that Xiao Mei was the cousin sister of the founder of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate.\u2019 Who could be called cousin brother by her and possess the name Xiao Yan\u2026 who else could it be other than that founder of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate,\u2019 who possessed an incomparable reputation within the Jia Nan Academy?</p><br/><p>The noisy open ground suddenly became quiet. Sunlight scattered down from the sky and shone on the many stunned faces. At this moment, a kind of absurd strange feeling of disbelief rose in everyone\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019s\u2019 founder, who had only existed in legends, had just appeared in front of them from out of nowhere?</p><br/><p>As they looked at the face that contained a smile, everyone knew that \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 would likely simmer today because of this\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The atmosphere within the spacious and well lit hall was somewhat pressuring and exciting. A couple of gazes that contained various emotions were gathered on the black-robed, young man who was on a chair seated in the hall.</p><br/><p>There were not many people in the hall. Only a couple of people that could be counted with one\u2019s fingers were present. Moreover, all of them were familiar faces. Other than Xiao Mei and Xin Lan, the remaining few were old friends who had entered the Inner Academy at the same time as Xiao Yan and had followed him when \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 had been established.</p><br/><p>Xiao Mei stood docile beside Xiao Yan. The tea pot in her hand was tilted and a line of water came out, carefully landing in the teacup in front of her. Due to her bending her body slightly, an alluring snowy-whiteness was carelessly revealed, attracting people\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan looked steadily forward. Only after Xiao Mei finished pouring the tea and straightened her body did his gaze drift as he smiled to her. Immediately, his gaze swept over the couple of people in the hall and laughed, \u201cEveryone, please sit. We are all close. Why do you need to be so polite?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, chief, we have waited for you to return. The group of people outside appear to have become crazy\u2026\u201d A strong-built man rubbed his head and laughed in a simple and honest manner. Xiao Yan remembered him, Atai, a simple and straightforward name. Back then, it was this fellow who had initially instigated the formation of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate.\u2019 However, after having not met for many years, the current him had become somewhat formal and restrained in front of Xiao Yan. After all, there were quite a lot of rumors regarding Xiao Yan during these years. The gap between the two of them had also been quietly pulled apart. The friendship of the past also had gained an additional hint of respect and fear.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled slightly and let out a deep sigh in his heart. After having not returned for such a long time, he began to feel like the people had hanged despite the structure being the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you are really the chief?\u201d Xin Lan, who was using an unusual gaze to stare at Xiao Yan finally could not help but ask while he was sighing emotionally.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Do I not look like him?\u201d Xiao Yan looked at this beautiful alchemist of the Xiao Gate and involuntarily teased.</p><br/><p>Xin Lan\u2019s face became slightly red. Her gaze did not reveal too much embarrassment as she once again sized Xiao Yan carefully. She replied in a graceful manner, \u201cYou are much better looking compared to the statue. Therefore, I failed to recognize you earlier. Please do not blame me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan could not help but smile and shake his head when he heard this. He was just about to speak when the tightly shut door let out a \u2018bang\u2019 and was violently pushed open. A lovely snort reverberated around the large hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, brat, you are finally back. You have left for two years in one go. You are really enjoying being an irresponsible owner, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan could not help but smile when he heard this familiar voice. He raised his head and could only see sunlight shining in from the outside. A short-haired lady with a lovely figure stood under the permeating sunlight, and a pair of bright unruly eyes viciously stared at Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>A man with a blood-colored, heavy ruler on his back stood beside the woman. That normally cold and stern face of his was also currently filled with a joy that came from his heart.</p><br/><p>A heartwarming smile also gradually surfaced on Xiao yan\u2019s face as he looked at the two familiar figures in the doorway.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Some of the arcs appeared to be a substance-like lightning shape, appearing extremely mysterious.</p><br/><p>Once this so called Lightning Bat Sky Wings appeared, the entire auction house became somewhat quiet. Some of the people, who did not know what\u2019s what, appeared a little lost. A commotion, however, broke out among those who had heard of the name Flying Dou Technique, like the Blood Sect, Black Skeleton Tomb, and the other factions in front. Clearly, this so called Lightning Bat Sky Wings had interested them. After all, as long as one had this Dou Technique, they would be able to fly, just like a strong Dou Wang. This was definitely something that one must have to easily kill people and flee!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing is interesting. I like it.\u201d The Blood Sect\u2019s Junior Sect Leader\u2019s gaze stared intently at the strange bat wings, which had escaped from the jade scroll as he softly muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Sect Leader, the price of this flying Dou Technique is likely going to be over a million. If we continue to squander like this, we might not be able to compete for the last item.\u201d Upon hearing Fan Ling\u2019s words, a similarly pale-faced old man could not resist whispering with worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you so anxious?\u201d Fan Ling glanced at the old man and coldly laughed, \u201cSince father has already made preparations, that thing will land in our hands regardless of who gets it through the auction. In that case, we might even be able to save a large sum.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, that is a little too risky. Moreover, if the information is leaked, it would be a little troublesome.\u201d The old man hesitantly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI naturally have my own plans. There is no need to be overly concerned Elder Luo.\u201d Fan Ling\u2019s gaze was dark and cold as he eyed the group of people from the Black Skeleton Tomb, who were seated not far away, while speaking indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Seeing that his advice was useless, the one called Elder Luo could only helplessly sigh. He shook his head and ceased speaking.</p><br/><p>On the crystal platform, the white-haired auctioneer spat his saliva in all directions as he roughly explained the effect of the flying Dou Technique. When those people, who were originally somewhat at a loss, heard that this thing could allow a person to fly in the sky without advancing to the Dou Wang level, their eyes instantly became fiery.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I think that everyone should also know that Flying Dou Techniques are currently extremely rare. After our negotiations, this \u2018Lightning Bat Sky Wings\u2019 can be considered to be a Low Class Middle Xuan Flying Dou Technique if it were to be ranked according to its class. Therefore, the based price is set at one million. The auction will now begin.\u201d The white haired auctioneer smiled again as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, it is actually this expensive.\u201d Hearing the high price of one million, Xiao Yan shook his head. He could sense the heated gazes within the auction ground had instantly been greatly reduced when the price was announced.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, it is indeed a little expensive, but the Flying Dou Technique is worth this price. This is also the reason why even I said that you were lucky when you obtain the \u2018Purple Cloud Wings\u2019 from the mountain cave back then. At the very least, you are likely the only person who possesses a Flying Dou Technique in the Jia Ma Empire.\u201d Yao Lao laughter suddenly sounded in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, this is the first time I have seen a Flying Dou Technique other than the Purple Cloud Wings. Teacher, if the \u2018Lightning Bat Sky Wings\u2019 were to be compared with my Purple Cloud Wings, which would be faster?\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and asked somewhat curiously in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Purple Cloud Wings\u2019 of yours is a Middle Level Xuan Class Level technique while this is a Low Level Xuan Class technique. Naturally, yours are a little faster. However, due to being made from a Lightning Bat, this \u2018Lightning Bat Sky Wings\u2019 speed can be pushed to extreme limits during a lightning storm. At other times, it can only be considered ordinary.\u201d Yao Lao smiled as he replied.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head with understanding. He withdrew his gaze. Now that he had the \u2018Purple Cloud Wings\u2019, the \u2018Lightning Bat Sky Wings\u2019 may appear extremely amazing, but it was nothing compared to his current technique and would not grab his interest.</p><br/><p>Although he was not overly interested, it did not mean that others were the same as him. Just as the white-haired auctioneer voice fell, the Junior Sect Leader of the Blood Sect, Fan Ling, slowly stood up. His threatening gaze looked at everyone around him. Anyone whose eyes came into contact with his would involuntarily avert their sight. Only those strong people, who were similarly supported by quite a strong strength, acted as though they sensed nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne million three hundred thousand!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fan Ling withdrew his gaze and coldly issued a price that caused an uproar within the auction house. Directly raising the price by three hundred thousand in one go. It appeared this fellow was intending to announce one thing to everyone: This Young Master wants the Flying Dou Technqiue!</p><br/><p>Under this price, the entire auction house was calm, aside from a few whispers, for awhile before a bewitching laughter, that seeped directly into one\u2019s bones sounded, \u201cJunior Sect Leader Fan Ling is really generous. However, our \u2018Sky Serpent Mansion\u2019 is also quite interested in this \u2018Lightning Bat Sky Wing\u2019. Therefore, I apologize. One million four hundred thousand.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression of that Fan Ling could not help but change slightly when he heard this bewitching voice. His eyes solidified slightly as he eyed the other side of the auction house. At the place where he looked, a few tall, sexy bodies were sitting there, relaxing on their furry chairs. Their soft waists were as alluring as water serpents.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, it is actually Elder Qing from the \u2018Sky Serpent Mansion\u2019. It is really unexpected that you also came to participate in the auction fair this year.\u201d Fan Ling gave a superficial smile as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no choice. There are some things which one cannot keep concealed. Don\u2019t you agree, Junior Sect Leader?\u201d That bewitching lady, who was called Elder Qing, smiled as she asked her question. Her enchanting figure caused a nefarious flame to dance within the hearts of quite a number of young men in the auction house. If they were to press down this body of snake-like softness and hear the sounds emitted from those moist-red lips, just how crazy would they become?</p><br/><p>\u201cSky Serpent Mansion?\u201d Xiao Yan could not help but question when he heard this name.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, little fellow, back then you even exchanged blows with people from the \u2018Sky Serpent Mansion\u2019. Don\u2019t tell me you have forgotten?\u201d Yao Lao spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cExchanged blows?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. Immediately, he appeared to have recalled something and the expression under his black robe changed drastically, \u201cThat mysterious woman and the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they are people who belong to the \u2018Sky Serpent Mansion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Lin is in their hands.\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s expression was slightly gloomy.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, you need not be too worried for that little girl. Her life at the \u2018Sky Serpent Mansion\u2019 is actually better than any other place. Those strange and unique eyes of hers would cause the \u2018Sky Serpent Mansion\u2019 to use all their resources to train her. If you meet her in the future, you might be shocked by her strength.\u201d Yao Lao comforted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHopefully. However, if I have the opportunity in the future, I will go and look for her. If it is indeed really as teacher has said, then I\u2019ll forget about it. If the \u2018Sky Serpent Mansion\u2019 tries to forcefully take a person\u2019s eyes, like that Mo clan, I will definitely not let her stay in that kind of place.\u201d Xiao Yan mused in his heart. Xiao Yan\u2019s heart felt a little sympathy for that little girl who had such a miserable life. Moreover, she was snatched away from his hands. Therefore, he also felt a little ashamed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Yao Lao gave a response before immediately descended into silence.</p><br/><p>During the time that Yao Lao was conversing with Xiao Yan, the competition in the auction house had already escalated to a level that could cause people to shudder with fear. While Fan Ling and that Elder Qing were bidding against each other, the other factions would also occasionally fan the flames and raise the price. Therefore, in just a short while, the \u2018Lightning Bat Sky Wings\u2019, that's base price was one million, had risen to over one million seven hundred thousand. Moreover, from the looks of the situation, it was actually a close fight, a situation that was difficult to resolve.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne million nine hundred thousand!\u201d Fan Ling inhaled a deep breath of air and a morbid-like redness surfaced on his pale white face. His dense dark gaze stared at the enchanting and moving Elder Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Sect Leader Fan Ling is really generous. One million nine hundred thousand. I hope that you still have sufficient money at the end.\u201d After Fan Ling\u2019s final price, the old face of Elder Qing also changed slightly. Their purpose this time around was not the flying Dou Technique . Wasting too much money at this time was clearly somewhat unwise. Therefore, she could only give up continuing to compete. She shrugged her shoulders and said with curled lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph.\u201d Fan Ling let out a cold laugh. He turned his head and threw his gaze toward the crystal platform, shouting coldly at the auctioneer, who was somewhat out of it, \u201cWhy are you still in a daze?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Ke ke, Junior Sect Leader, please don\u2019t be angry.\u201d The white-haired auctioneer, who was shocked awake, hurriedly said with a smile. After facing the auction ground and asked three times according to the rules, the auction hammer in his hand finally came down, announcing the final owner.</p><br/><p>Following the fall of the auction hammer, the flying Dou Technique fell into Fan Ling\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, they are indeed worthy of being a large faction. They act so extraordinarily. One million nine hundred thousand. This enormous sum is equal to a couple years worth of our Xiao clan\u2019s income.\u201d As Xiao Yan eyed Fan Ling, who slowly sat down, he could not resist smacking his lips and whispered with a smile.</p><br/><p>After the \u2018Lightning Bat Sky Wings\u2019 was auctioned off, at the highest price seen since the start of the auction, the bidders in the back descended into a low tide. Although the earlier items were auctioned off at a price that wouldn\u2019t make others speechless, it undoubtedly caused people to stop feeling shock when they compared it to the sky high price of this technique.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan leaned his back against the chair. His finger gently tapped on his knee. Occasionally, his peripheral vision would sweep across those people from the \u2018Sky Serpent Mansion\u2019. One could not tell what the face under the black robe was thinking.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, the thing that is going to be auctioned off next is somewhat strange. This is because even we cannot figure out exactly what its use is. However after repeated distinguishment from our auction fair, it appears to be a certain, unknown treasure map.\u201d The white-haired auctioneer bent his body to take out a silver plate. After which, he carefully pulled aside the cloth on top of the silver plate. Immediately, a dilapidated ancient cloth piece appeared in everyone\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoo.\u201d As they saw the dilapidated cloth fragment, everyone in the hall immediately emitted a booing sound after it had been quiet for a while.</p><br/><p>The smile on the white haired auctioneer\u2019s face was somewhat awkward as he heard the unhappy responses. After their examination, this old cloth should be a map. This could be recognized from the routes and symbols on it. However, they did not manage to gain much other than this, with the exception of...</p><br/><p>The corner of the auctioneer eyes glanced at that old cloth. His fingers twisted it and placed it across the light in front of everyone\u2019s eyes. He pointed at a certain picture at the edge, where only half of it existed and said with a smile, \u201cIf it is what I think it is, this map should be very old. Although I am uncertain what it leads to, an ancient item should not be an ordinary one right? A person has to gamble a little. If anyone could obtain the complete map and is lucky enough, the thing that is hidden may shake the entire continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi.\u201d Most people gave a snort of contempt in the face of these words of his.</p><br/><p>Of course, not everyone reacted like this. At the very least, the eyes of the current Xiao Yan abruptly widened.</p><br/><p>His gaze contained a slight shiver as he stared at the drawing located at the edge of that map fragment. He inhaled a cool, deep breath within his heart and did his best to suppress the rolling and surging thoughts in him. There were two of map fragments similar to this within his storage ring.</p><br/><p>That image with only one side was not just some lines, but was the \u2018Purifying Lotus Demon Flame\u2019, ranked third on the \u2018Heavenly Flame Ranking\u2019!</p><br/><p>The \u2018Purifying Lotus Demon Flame\u2019 was a terrifying \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 which even Yao Lao had never seen before. Legend has it that under this kind of demon flame, Dou Zongs and even Dou Zuns could only tremble in fear. If he obtained it, would the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 directly evolve into a legendary Tian Class Qi Method?</p><br/><p>Of course, Xiao Yan was also ignorant of this answer. The only thing that the current him knew was that he had to obtain that map fragment at all costs!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

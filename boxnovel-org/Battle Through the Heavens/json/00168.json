Looking at the manner of these two, the young man had obviously passed the tier two test.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a frightening person\u2026\u201d Everyone looked at each other as they sighed gently in their hearts. A nineteen years old tier two alchemist. This could be considered as a new record in the Jia Ma Empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy\u2026 actually managed to succeed? At nineteen, he has actually reached the Dou Shi level? How is this possible?\u201d Opening her red lips, Lin Fei softly mumbled with astonishment.</p><br/><p>Beside her, Xue Mei also nodded her head slightly. Wasn\u2019t this guy far too monstrous?</p><br/><p>Seeing the shocked expressions of everyone in the hall, Frank and Ao Tuo also faced each other and smiled bitterly. After observing Xiao Yan refining a medicinal pill at close proximity, both of them could not help but feel amazed at the talent in refining pills that Xiao Yan had demonstrated.</p><br/><p>Although it was Xiao Yan\u2019s first refinement using the medicinal formula provided for the test, his outstanding control of the flame was not inferior to any true tier two alchemist. Moreover, when he was refining the medicine, he was extremely accurate in refining the essence of the medicinal ingredients. If this was a very experienced tier two alchemist, Frank and Ao Tuo would not feel much surprise. However, the guy in front of them was merely nineteen years old...</p><br/><p>When they were at his age back then, they were still just beginning to learn how to differentiate medicinal ingredients under the guidance of their teachers.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe really is a guy who makes others feel inferior\u2026 Now, I am more and more curious as to which grandmaster actually managed to teach such an outstanding student?\u201d Frank bitterly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this young boy\u2019s talent for refining medicine may be outstanding but an outstanding unpolished gem will not become something great without meticulous cutting and polishing\u2026 That mysterious teacher of his must be very great. At the very least, if Xiao Yan was to be taught by both of us, he would not be able to achieve this effect.\u201d Ao Tuo acknowledged his inferiority.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut that Purple Flame of his, it is indeed not a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. Although it is much stronger compared to a normal flame, it is not that potent or exotic\u2026\u201d Frank said doubtfully as he frowned and recalled the way Xiao Yan refined medicine from earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Indeed, it doesn\u2019t seem like a \u201cHeavenly Flame\u2019 but that doesn\u2019t really matter. There are many strange people and occurrences in the Dou Qi continent. There will always be some mysterious things that are not discovered by others. Although the Purple Flame is strong, it is only slightly stronger than the Dou Qi Flame belonging to Alchemists of a similar tier. It is undoubtedly much weaker when compared to a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.\u201d Ao Tuo said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Nodding his head, Frank tilted his head, faced the interior of the room and said, \u201cYoung boy, once you\u2019ve packed up your things, you can come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Frank\u2019s voice, the figure of Xiao Yan slowly walked out of the room. He lightly brushed away some of the medicinal powder that had landed on his ordinary garments before his gaze swept across the faces of everyone in the hall and smiled.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan looking over, all the alchemists in the hall also returned a friendly smile. Although their identity meant that they held top statuses in Black Rock City and that anyone who saw them during an ordinary day would respectfully greet them, the medicinal refining talent the young man in front of them displayed caused them to be afraid of slighting him. After all, this young man might well become an alchemist grandmaster greater than Frank or Ao Tuo in the future.</p><br/><p>When he saw Xiao Yan coming out, Frank waved his hand toward one of his subordinates. The latter hurriedly walked out of the hall. A moment later, he returned with a jade plate that was carrying an exquisitely made black colored long robe.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the special apparel for a tier two alchemist. Before the material was used to make this long robe, it was first soaked in a medicinal pool that was cultivated by the Alchemist Association. Thus, you should not look down on it. After wearing it, the cloth material that was soaked in the medicinal liquid will come into contact with the air and release a strange scent. This strange scent will help the wearer maintain an alert state at all times. Additionally, under it\u2019s stimulation, the skin of a person will become somewhat sensitive. When this happens, it will help the alchemist to have slightly better control of their flame when refining medicine.\u201d Frank received the jade plate and proudly announced in detail the effect of the long robe, \u201cAt the same time, it also possesses immunity to some poisons. Moreover, after being specially made by the Alchemist Association, the defensive ability of this Alchemist\u2019s long robe is even stronger than ordinary armors. If it were not for the the costliness of making it, resulting in the impossibility of making it in bulk, the Empire would have already snatched it and used it to equip its soldiers\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the introduction by Frank, Xiao Yan was also a little amazed. He did not expect that this magnificent looking long robe would have so many coveted abilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder so many alchemists join the Alchemist Association. This kind of treatment really attracts people\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan received the long robe and swept his eyes over it. He noticed an alchemist badge was placed near the chest region. On the badge was an ancient looking medicinal cauldron with two mercury like ripples on it that continued to twist slightly, like they were something alive.</p><br/><p>Panning his palm over the pitch black robe, Xiao Yan felt a gentle sensation that was like the tender skin of a lady. It was extremely beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk\u2026 an alchemist is undoubtedly the most prestigious job in the Dou Qi continent. Just this long robe would likely have cost over a hundred thousand gold coins to manufacture.\u201d Xiao Yan flipped the black colored long robe around and looked at it in a very attached manner. After which, he removed his ordinary rough outer garment and pulled it over his body. Instantly, the black robe touched his skin, causing him to feel refreshed and comfortable much like he was dipped in a mist of water. A strange fragrance also stealthily entered his nose and his exhausted mind was suddenly much more active.</p><br/><p>After a year of tough training, Xiao Yan\u2019s figure had also gradually grew. Although his face still appeared thin, it had a faint elegant feeling now that he had put on this appropriate black long robe. The last bit of tenderness on his face was also perfectly concealed.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Xiao Yan had appeared as though he had completely changed into a new person after putting on the Alchemist long robe, Frank and Ao Tuo smiled and nodded. Clearly, they were quite pleased with Xiao Yan\u2019s current image.</p><br/><p>Within the hall, Xue Mei and Lin Fei who were staring at Xiao Yan and noticed the change in him and surprise flashed across their faces. In their examination, they paused longer on Xiao Yan\u2019s smiling face a while longer without anyone noticing.</p><br/><p>\u201cExcellent\u2026\u201d After personally experiencing the benefit the Alchemist robe brought, Xiao Yan nodded and let out repeated praises.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s satisfied manner, Frank smiled. The influence that an alchemist could create was really too big. In order to gather those with great ability to this prestigious occupation, the Alchemist Association had really put in a great amount of effort.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, the examination is already over. Everyone, please disperse.\u201d</p><br/><p>Frank faced the hall and waved his hand. After which, he turned to Xiao Yan and said with a smile, \u201cDo you have time? If you do, I would like to chat with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan smiled and nodded his head as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s just as well. Chairman, I have some things that I also need to ask for. I hope you\u2019ll be able to help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. Xue Mei, Lin Fei, the both of you should follow the others who passed the test to go and take the tier one alchemist badge and long robe. We still have some things to do so we cannot accompany you.\u201d After smiling to Xue Mei, Frank exchange a glance with Ao Tuo before the two of them led the way out of the hall.</p><br/><p>Watching this obvious inferior treatment, Lin Fei could only helplessly nod her head. With dissatisfaction, she grimaced at Frank\u2019s back and muttered, \u201cBias!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Stop complaining. He has the qualifications to make teacher biased. If you are dissatisfied, you can immediately go and take the test for a tier two alchemist.\u201d Xue Mei said with a smile as she got up and walked toward the exit of the hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph\u2026 what\u2019s so great?\u201d Lin Fei softly snorted. Her footsteps followed Xue Mei but her voice obviously lacked the confidence. She was barely adequate to take the test for a tier one alchemist. A tier two test\u2026 it was not as though she was as full of herself as she appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, please take a seat,\u201d In a tidy study, Frank told Xiao Yan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Randomly taking a seat on a chair, Xiao Yan did not beat around the bush as he said, \u201cGrandmasters, if you have any questions, please ask. If the questions are not too intrusive, I will not hide anything.\u201d As he said this, a cunningness flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes; what was or wasn\u2019t too intrusive was determined by him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, what a crafty and alert young man.\u201d Frank shook his head and laughed. After living for quite a few decades, Frank naturally understood the meaning behind Xiao Yan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have already registered with the Association, we naturally needed to perform some administrative work. Ah\u2026 regarding the part of your teacher in the registration information from earlier\u2026 it seems somewhat incorrect. In my memory, there doesn\u2019t seem to be an Alchemist Grandmaster in the Jia Ma Empire called Yao Lao.\u201d Frank asked with a smile as his hand waved at the information that Xiao Yan had registered with earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but before I left, my teacher had told me not to reveal any information about him. However, he has never registered with the Association.\u201d Xiao Yan spread his hands out as he replied.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Frank and Ao Tuo shook their heads helplessly. It appeared that trying to get information of his teacher from this kid\u2019s mouth appeared nearly impossible.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright , since you are unwilling to say, we will not make things difficult for you. There are indeed some strong people within the Jia Ma Empire who do not like others knowing about them.\u201d Letting out a sigh, Ao Tuo mused for a moment before asking, \u201cThe last question. About the purple colored flame that you were controlling\u2026 you may also know that that flame of yours isn\u2019t a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it would be good if it was\u2026\u201d Shaking his head with a smile, Xiao Yan half truthfully said, \u201cThat Purple Flame is something that I coincidentally managed to obtain from the Amethyst Winged Lion. Don\u2019t ask me in detail on how I obtained it. When I met it in the Magic Beast Mountain Range, it spit flame at me for no reason. If I did not possess something that protected my life, I might have been incinerated by it on the spot. After the incident, I realized that there was an additional Purple Flame in my body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmethyst Winged Lion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, both Frank and Ao Tuo momentarily stilled. They then quickly nodded their head as though they had realized something. \u201cNo wonder\u2026 it is the Purple Flame from an Amethyst Winged Lion. I was just wondering why it had a faint violent and wild character. You are really fortunate to be able to get a hold of this thing. Back then there were also quite a number of Alchemists who were planning on getting hold of its flame. Sadly, they all failed in the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, forget it. Basically, we didn\u2019t get you to reveal any information.\u201d Frank waved his hand and helplessly said, \u201cJust tell us your problem.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cH ha.\u201d Xiao Yan opened his mouth and laughed. He then closed his lips tightly and stared intently at the two of them. He said softly, \u201cI need something. I\u2019m not sure if you grandmasters can help me check if any other alchemist possesses it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIce Spirit Cold Fountain!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

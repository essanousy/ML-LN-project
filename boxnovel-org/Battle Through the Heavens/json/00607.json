While its body became thinner and illusionary, a cluster of invisible and unusual flame glow, whose existence could be clearly felt by people, grew increasingly bright at a certain spot under the huge mouth of the fire python.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief after seeing the large body of the invisible fire serpent becoming increasingly illusionary. He wiped off the perspiration that was like a stream on his face. Only after his mind quietly became relaxed did he feel the searing pain that filled his entire body. After being in such close proximity with the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 earlier, he still ended suffering quite a bit despite being isolated by the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be a period of time in which the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 will be in a weakened state after revealing its form. This period of time would be the golden opportunity for you to snatch it. Originally, I had wanted others to force it to this state, but it is really unexpected that you need rely upon yourself in the end.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s laughter sounded in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head slightly. He focused all his attention on watching the increasingly illusionary invisible fire python. Silver-colored glows once again flashed and appeared underneath his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is quite a significant difficulty in snatching the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. If it cannot be helped, unleash the strength that you borrowed from me to the maximum. That will allow your strength to be on par with Han Feng in a head on collision\u2026 although this may expose my existence, you must definitely get your hands on the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019.\u201d Yao Lao was quiet for a moment before he suddenly voiced his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan hesitated a little when he heard this before slowly nodding his head. He clenched his fist tightly as he softly spoke in his heart, \u201cRelax, teacher. You have protected this disciple for so many years. In the future\u2026 it should be this disciple\u2019s turn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old spirit that was hidden within Xiao Yan\u2019s body laughed softly. A faint warmth caused the spirit to emit a weak glow. He was blind once. However, the Heavens did not treat him poorly. They did not allow him to experience the same harm once again. The kind of heart felt pain that came from being betrayed by one\u2019s kin penetrated deep into his bones.</p><br/><p>\u201cJi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sharp hissing sound once again venerated throughout the sky. Suddenly the invisible flame that had spread through the sky vanished, appearing as though it had never existed.</p><br/><p>The high temperature in the sky also gradually fell following the disappearance of the flame that spread throughout the sky. However, no one paid much attention to this. At this moment, their gazes were all paused on the spot in the sky where the invisible fire python had disappeared. At that spot\u2026 a cluster of strange \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 that was around five feet in size was slowly rising.</p><br/><p>This cluster of flame appeared to be invisible. However, no matter who it was that looked at it, they would feel a substance-like unique sense. The flame appeared to have something that was slowly flowing in it, much like a spirit.</p><br/><p>Although this was merely a cluster of flame from its outer appearance, it gave people an extremely unusual feeling. This cluster of flame seemed to possess a human-like intelligence and spirit.</p><br/><p>The entire sky was silent. Everyone had a surprised face as they watched the cluster of invisible flame. Was this cluster of flame the true body of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019?</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, do it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s low cry suddenly sounded in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart while everyone was momentarily absent-minded.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao voice had just sounded when the wings behind Xiao Yan\u2019s back were flapped. Finally, his body turned into a flowing light that shot toward the cluster of invisible flame.</p><br/><p>The moment Xiao Yan\u2019s body moved, a wild joy also erupted onto Han Feng\u2019s face below. The dark-blue flame in both of his hands swiftly rolled like a tidal wave. With his knowledge of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, he naturally clearly understood that after having just revealed its true body, the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 would be at its weakest. When would he act if he did not act now?</p><br/><p>\u201cStop Han Feng!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian, who had been paying great attention to Han Feng and the experts of the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 had a sunken expression when he saw Han Feng\u2019s actions. He waved his sleeves and cried out sternly.</p><br/><p>During the time that Han Feng and Xiao Yan were entangled with the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 earlier, all the Elders within the Inner Academy had taken the opportunity to recuperate the Dou Qi in their bodies. Hence, numerous human figures instantly rushed to the sky when they heard Su Qian\u2019s loud cry. Dou Qi wings leaped out and they formed a large human wall at the spot where Han Feng was.</p><br/><p>\u201cGold Silver Brothers, friends from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019, lend me a hand! Han Feng will thank you properly after we succeed!\u201d Han Feng\u2019s expression also changed a little when he saw the numerous interceptions. He immediately turned to the various experts from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 and cried out loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, you only need to concern yourself with snatching the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. We will help you stop these people!\u201d The Gold Silver Brothers let out a strange \u2018tsk tsk\u2019 laugh. With a wave of their hands, the large group of human figures behind them rushed out like a sharp blade that pierced directly toward the hindering web of Elders from the Jia Nan Academy, twisting it until it was in tatters.</p><br/><p>The chaotic great battle in the sky once again erupted as the large troops from both parties once again gathered.</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s expression was dark and solemn as he watched the defensive web that was broken. He was just about to act when two human figures flashed and appeared. One was gold and the other was silver. Clearly, they were the strongest Gold Silver Brothers from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019s\u2019 side.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, Elder Su. Isn\u2019t it just a cluster of flame? Why do you need to go all out like this\u2026\u201d The gold-robed brother smiled as he spoke to Su Qian while the silver-robed brother laughed strangely and agreed by the side.</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s gaze was filled with fury as he watched the two people appear next to him. A moment later, the fury on his face suddenly became calm. Both of his palms were extended out from his sleeves as his tone became dark and cold due to its indifference, \u201cLooks like the Jia Nan Academy has been too nice to the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 during these few years, resulting in all of you climbing onto our heads now. Alright\u2026 quite a lot of time has passed since the great battle back then. Looks like we need something that will shock and awe. In that case\u2026 I will start with the two of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding space suddenly began to ripple after Su Qian\u2019s words sounded. A majestic aura slowly surged out from the interior of the former\u2019s body. That aura was enormous to the point that no one present could match it.</p><br/><p>The expression of the Gold Silver Brothers also changed a little as they sensed Su Qian\u2019s frightening aura that was basically raised to the limit. They crossed their hands and their two auras agglomerated together. Only then did they manage to endure against Su Qian. Although they were known to be able to fight with an expert Dou Zong when they joined hands, the party which would be at a disadvantage when they met with a more troublesome elite Dou Zong. After all, the gap between a Dou Huang and a Dou Zong was really too huge\u2026</p><br/><p>The entire sky began to vibrate because of these two majestic Dou Qis. While this was happening, Xiao Yan was the first to arrive at the cluster where the true body of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 due to the absence of anyone stopping him.</p><br/><p>Although this cluster that was the true body of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 did not move in the sky, the frightening temperature that it emitted still caused the surrounding space to be repeatedly distorted. Even Xiao Yan, who was close to it, had no choice but to use the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 and swiftly form a thick green fire armor around his body.</p><br/><p>With the help of the isolation by the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019, Xiao Yan managed to successfully approach the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. His gaze passed through the flame armor and eyed the invisible flame that was within close proximity, appearing as though he could obtain it just by extending his hand. Even with Xiao Yan\u2019s mental strength, he could not help but feel his breathing becoming hurried at this moment.</p><br/><p>The green-colored flame surged swiftly on Xiao Yan\u2019s hand. Finally, it agglomerated into a large fire arm. Xiao yan had just controlled it to grab the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 when the face that was hidden under the armor suddenly turned a flushed red. His entire body instantly stiffened.</p><br/><p>A cluster of hot Heart Flame had strangely surfaced within Xiao Yan\u2019s body at the spot where his heart was. It immediately unleashed a recklessly high temperature that was filled with destructive strength. Its intention was as though it wanted to completely incinerate everything within Xiao Yan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>The appearance of this Heart Flame seemed to be stronger than any other prior experiences that Xiao Yan had experienced. However, the Heart Flame did not help to refine his Dou Qi this time around. Instead, it was filled with a kind of destructive strength that Xiao Yan had never experienced before\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit\u2026\u201d A voice that contained hot air seeped out from the gap between Xiao Yan\u2019s teeth. The \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 within Xiao Yan\u2019s body surged swiftly. Immediately, it firmly wrapped around the cluster of \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 before the latter\u2019s high temperature was completely unleashed!</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful. This \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 specializes in summoning Heart Flames. Such a flame is very hard to prevent. If one is careless, one would be completely incinerated from inside out.\u201d Yao Lao reminded solemnly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. His body did not dare to make the slightest movement. This was because he had sensed that the closer he was to the cluster of \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019, the hotter and more terrifying the Heart Flame that appeared in his heart was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>During the time that Xiao Yan was at a stalemate with the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019, a ferocious wind suddenly shot over from behind. Xiao Yan\u2019s heart was cold. He could not be bothered about the standoff with the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. A silver glow flashed under his feet and his body suddenly disappeared. It was already over a dozen meters away from the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 when it reappeared.</p><br/><p>The heart flame that was writhing within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart gradually weakened after having withdrawn by a distance. He turned his head in a dark and cold manner only to coincidentally see Han Feng who had already broken through the circle blocking him. Clearly, the attack earlier was unleashed by him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes narrowed as he watched Han Feng who had charged up and rushed to where the true body of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 was. The green flame in his palm writhed as wisps of dense cold killing intent flashed across his eyes. This fellow was in such a rush to charge over but he had no idea that the closer he was to the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019, the more dangerous it was. At that time, it would be the best opportunity to take action to kill him!</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu!\u201d</p><br/><p>A wild joy involuntarily surfaced on Han Feng\u2019s face as he looked at the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 in such close proximity. At this moment, he no longer had any mood to be bothered about Xiao Yan whom he had forced to withdraw. As long as he grabbed the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019, it was possible for him to swiftly leave this place, hide himself and refine it. Once his refinement succeeded, forget about Su Qian, even that old headmaster of the Inner Academy would not be able to do anything to him should he return!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 is mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng\u2019s body flashed and charged into a radius of five meters from the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. The wild joy in his eyes had yet to completely disappear when his body suddenly stiffened just like Xiao Yan\u2019s did earlier!</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Han Feng\u2019s body stiffened, Xiao Yan\u2019s body disappeared from the distance in a lightning-like manner. Only the faint sound of rolling thunder resounded across the sky.</p><br/><p>The expression of the stiffened Han Feng also changed the instant that the rolling thunder sounded!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

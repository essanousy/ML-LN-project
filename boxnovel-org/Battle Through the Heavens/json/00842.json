The auction items that had appeared at this moment could already be considered a high grade items. The auction price was basically a sky high one to an ordinary person. Hence, most of the people were merely adopting the mentality of watching a show at this moment as they observed this auction. However, being able to witness some large factions fight over some treasures until their faces turned red and their necks became stiff made this trip worthwhile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had seldom bid after bidding for the \u2018Six Joint Body Flowing Ruler\u2019. Occasionally, he gave some bids because he fancied some rarer medicinal ingredients. Although their prices were expensive, they won in terms of not having too many competitors. Therefore, by the time he had spent all of the three million gold coins in his pocket, quite a few unusually rare spiritual medicines had landed in his hand.</p><br/><p>As some auctioned items that caused one to be dazzled were placed on the auction table one after another, even Xiao Yan could not help but feel surprised by this rich stockpile of the Black Emperor Sect. During the auction, some of the auctioned items were things that caused him to feel some longing. However, after some thought, he did not issue a bid.</p><br/><p>Originally, Xiao Yan\u2019s greatest hope was to find a Monster Core of a rank 7 Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast in this auction. Currently, the distance of the conditions for the Little Fairy Doctor to control the \u2018Woeful Poison Body\u2019 were coming closer. As long as they could obtain the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, all that was left was that tier 7 Monster Core. If Xiao Yan was able to find it during this auction, he would naturally save the time and effort needed to search for it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had thought of a beautiful picture but the Heavens did not follow his desire. The Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was an existence of a mysterious beast from the ancient times, much less one that was rank 7. At this rank, a Magical Beast\u2019s intelligence was already not any weaker than a human. Additionally, it could transform its body and was very similar to a human. How would it be so easy to obtain the Monster Core from a Magical Beast of such rank?</p><br/><p>Hence, Xiao Yan could only sigh as this auction gradually approached its end without him seeing the thing he needed like he had hoped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to be anxious. There is news of even the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, which is the hardest to find. At least the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast has a recognizable name.\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor by his side softly whispered to him after hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s soft sigh. She naturally knew that the former was hoping to gather both of the items needed to control the \u2018Woeful Poison Body\u2019 from this auction.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled bitterly and nodded. He could only scatter the hope within his heart. After which, he slowly raised his head and threw his gaze toward the auction stage.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the auction gradually approached its end. Hence, the auctioned items that had appeared at this moment were mostly heavyweight items. For example, the item that was currently being auctioned was a scroll named \u2018Dark Shadow Skill\u2019. It was a Di class Middle level darkness affinity Qi Method.</p><br/><p>The value of such Qi Methods were usually much greater than Dou Skills of a similar class. For example, the price of this \u2018Dark Shadow Skill\u2019 scroll had already risen by a couple of large factions until a sky high eight million. From the looks of the momentum, there was actually no intention of stopping.</p><br/><p>Given the actual value of this kind of Di class Qi Method, such a price was not considered strange. Back then, the price of Xiao Yan\u2019s Di class Low level agility Dou Skill, the \u2018Three Thousand Lightning Movement\u2019, was also around this sum. Looking at it from this way, Xiao Yan could have been considered to have grabbed a deal by being able to successfully obtain the \u2018Six Joint Body Flowing Ruler\u2019 for three million one hundred thousand. If not for his status and that a ruler technique was unorthodox, obtaining it for three million would undoubtedly be just a daydream.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan did not have much interest in this so-called \u2018Dark Shadow Skill\u2019. He practiced the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 and it was impossible for him to change to other Qi Methods. However, the latter\u2019s class caused him to feel some desire. When his \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 reached this class, Xiao Yan\u2019s strength would definitely soar.</p><br/><p>However, he had to swallow \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 if he wanted the Flame Mantra to evolve. This kind of harsh condition caused Xiao Yan to feel somewhat helpless. Remembering the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, Xiao Yan once again recalled the three ancient map fragments that were quietly stored in his Storage Ring. He still did not have the slightest clue about the last map fragment. Moreover, he was not as lucky as he was last time when he found one during an auction\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like I can only take things slowly. When the time comes, I will ask First Elder Su Qian. He is extremely experienced and knowledgeable. It is possible that he might possess some information about the whereabouts of some \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 on the continent\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan involuntarily laughed as this thought flashed in his heart. He was indeed not really used to not having Yao Lao beside him. Although he no longer needed to borrow Yao Lao\u2019s strength given his current strength, Yao Lao\u2019s great knowledge was something that Xiao Yan could not compare with.</p><br/><p>The Dou Qi continent was incomparably large. There were many secrets hidden within it. Xiao Yan might currently be an expert Dou Huang, but the regions he had roamed only included the Jia Ma Empire and the Black-Corner Region. However, these two places were quite tiny when compared with the Dou Qi continent as a whole\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps, it is time to walk out of this region\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan softly sighed in his heart. His fist was slowly tightened. The perspective of the strong could not be limited by anything. The Dou Qi continent was the true stage. If he wanted to obtain a strength that could really contend with the mysterious \u2018Hall of Souls,\u2019 he would only be able to do so by traversing the Dou Qi continent!</p><br/><p>A hot fire quietly burned in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart as this thought surfaced. Roaming the continent had been his hope for many years. Now, it was perhaps the time to go and fulfill it. Of course, before that, he still needed to settle the problems in this place\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNine million seven hundred thousand!\u201d</p><br/><p>A loud cry from the auction stage woke Xiao Yan from his emotional mind. He raised his head and found that the \u2018Dark Shadow Skill\u2019 had already been successfully purchased by a person for the sky high price of nine million seven hundred thousand.</p><br/><p>Surprise flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s heart at this price. It was likely that the one who was able to take out such a huge sum was not an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze slid to the spot where this bid was issued from while his heart thought in this manner. He could only see a gray-haired eagle-nosed old man slowly sitting down.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes slightly as he studied that gray-haired eagle-nosed old man. Surprise flashed appeared in his heart. This was because he discovered that this old man was actually one of the two obscure auras that his Spiritual Perception had sensed earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder which faction he belongs to? I think he should also have come with the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva as his aim.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eagle-nosed old man in the distant VIP seat seemed to have faintly sensed a gaze being shot over. His head was immediately turned and his shriveled old face revealed a faint smile when he saw that the person who had shot his gaze over was actually Xiao Yan, whose entire body was wrapped in a black robe. He nodded slightly to Xiao Yan and the Little Fairy Doctor by his side before turning his head back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat sharp senses\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s heart was surprised when the eagle-nosed old man turned his head around to investigate. The solemness in his eyes became denser. If this person was not an elite Dou Zong, he definitely possessed of some special outstanding skill. Otherwise, it would not cause him to feel such faint fear.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly withdrew his gaze. The caution in his heart also became much denser. There were far too many experts who had an interest in the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva this time around. It will be a difficult task for him to successfully snatch it from all these experts.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe he, the item that is going to be auctioned next is somewhat strange. However, it should possess quite the great attraction to some people who have some needs.\u201d The white-haired old man on the auction stage wiped off the perspiration on his forehead and immediately waved his hand with a smile. The ground behind him slowly parted. Ten burly men carried an enormous object covered by a white cloth. They slowly climbed onto the stage.</p><br/><p>The large being that had suddenly appeared also stirred the curiosity of quite a number of people. Many gazes quickly shot over. Xiao Yan was among them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a corpse stench\u2026\u201d Zi Yan by his side wrinkled her small nose as she spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. At this moment, that white-haired old man let out an exhaling sound as he pulled down the white cloth covering the object. After which, an enormous corpse that was over a hundred feet large appeared in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>The size of this Magical Beast\u2019s body was quite large, but it appeared to have been dead for a long time. The bones and flesh on its body were in a dried state. The thing that attracted the most attention was the enormous wings that had already turned into white bones. This pair of enormous wings was quite strange. They appeared to be like some gem, emitting a faint fluorescent light. Any sharp-eyed person could tell from a glance that a strange energy was contained in these large wings.</p><br/><p>However, by being able to maintain some energy despite being dead for so long, it was likely that this Magical Beast was of quite a high rank when it was alive.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, this Magical Beast corpse is something that my Black Emperor Sect found by a mountain stream. After sect leader\u2019s appraisal, this Magical Beast should be a peerless beast that was about to break through the seventh rank to enter the eighth!\u201d The white-haired old man explained in a solemn manner.</p><br/><p>An uproar was stirred within the hall the moment his words sounded. A Magical Beast that was about to enter the 8th rank? Was that not equivalent to an elite Dou Zun? A Magical Beast of this rank possessed the ability to reach the sky. Their lifespan was also extremely long. Why would it die in this place?</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes locked firmly on the corpse of the Magical Beast while the auction ground was in an uproar. A moment later, he turned his eyes to its gem-like wings and an unusual flicker appeared in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s hands moved slightly under the black robe. A golden-colored scroll suddenly flashed out. Five eye-catching golden-light words were on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cSky Bird Nine Flying Wings!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

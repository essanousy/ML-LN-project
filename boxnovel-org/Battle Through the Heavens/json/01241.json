As this sound spread, the rippling of the entire space also became increasingly intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the energy seal, which was becoming increasingly illusory under the ripple, the eyes of the countless number of people outside of the sea of bones suddenly had a bright redness appearing within them. Even their breathing had become a lot rougher. They slowly used a greater amount of strength on their hands, which were holding on to their weapons.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes were narrowed as he looked at the increasingly distorted space. Amidst the strange splashing sound, he could sense a wave of extremely frightening energy ripple. This kind of ripple was unusually fierce. It was just like a volcano that was suppressed at the crust. There was a kind of crazy gushing feeling to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrush\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Another strange crushing sound appeared. The distorted space suddenly became still. Immediately one could hear a strange \u2018bang\u2019 sound. The distorted space was actually blasted into countless of spatial fragments with a \u2018clang\u2019 sound, appearing just like fragile glass.</p><br/><p>\u201cCharge. The ancient remains has been opened!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the spatial seal was blasted apart, the eyes of the countless number of human figures around the sea of bones immediately turned bright red. Their throat emitted a low and deep greedy roar. Their bodies became just like locust flying by as they rushed explosively towards the middle of the sea of bones.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithdraw quickly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to these people, who simply simply charge forward, Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed when the space burst apart. He grabbed Zi Yan beside him and his toes pressed on the tree branch. After which, his body suddenly pulled backwards. Little Fairy Doctor and the rest also reacted quickly. They immediately pulled back without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>While Xiao Yan\u2019s group was pulling back, there were also quite a number of human figures from the surrounding large trees suddenly pulling back. Clearly, they had also discovered something.</p><br/><p>During the time that Xiao Yan\u2019s group was rushing back, the spatial seal fragments that had been formed from the blast suddenly paused. Immediately, one could hear a loud \u2018bang\u2019. A wild and violent spatial strength that would cause even an elite Dou Zun to feel their heart palpitate, swept in all directions like a storm. Those who were the fastest to charge forward were the first to be struck by it. Within the blink of an eye, they were swallowed by the storm. Immediately, sharp miserable cries resounded on this sea of bones in a ripple like manner.</p><br/><p>The wild and violent spatial ripple annihilated those people charging at the front like it was cutting wheat. Some of those experts towards the back had also finally discovered that something was not quite right. Hence, the originally forward charging sea of people immediately turned around and fled in a miserable manner. The sea of bones appeared unusually chaotic at that moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to there being some distance, the spatial storm was no longer able to cause any damage to Xiao Yan\u2019s group by the time it had spread over. At this moment, the couple of them finally sighed in relief. Their eyes swept over the place and saw countless number of figures rolling on the ground and screaming miserably. Bright red fresh blood dyed a large portion of the dense white sea of bones.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a frightening spatial seal. It actually still possess such a frightening offensive strength even after so many years. This is indeed worthy of being the remains left by an elite Dou Sheng\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A surprised expression surfaced on the face of Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s group when they saw the destructive force that this spatial ripple had created.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026 these fellows are too anxious. They deserve to be unlucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He waved his hand and his body transformed into a ray of light that shot into the sea of bones. At the same time, the many experts, who had successfully dodge the spatial ripple earlier, also moved their bodies, transforming into numerous blurry figures that rushed into the sea of bones.</p><br/><p>The sea of bones was extremely vast. Only after Xiao Yan\u2019s group had rushed in did they discover that there was a towering mountain peak like large contour vaguely present within the sea of bones. Looking from a distance, it was as though there was an ancient fierce beast creeping under the sea of bones, causing one\u2019s heart to feel startled.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s group flying speed had involuntarily slowed greatly upon seeing the large contour. From the earlier spatial storm, they understood that this place was not a friendly one. If they were not careful, it was possible for them to even lose their lives in this place.</p><br/><p>Following their gradual approach, the white fog that was suspended within the sea of bones also gradually become thinner. That enormous thing also finally appeared in front of Xiao Yan\u2019s group sight.</p><br/><p>It was a large hall. It was a ten thousand feet large hall that appeared to be like a little mountain. Compared with this kind of large hall, the branch hall of the Hall of Soul that Xiao Yan saw the last time had become unusually tiny. A feeling of being tiny would suddenly be formed when one looked at this enormous thing that stood in this place.</p><br/><p>The large hall was bright red in colour. Looking from a distance, it appeared as though a flame was rising from it, appearing exceptionally glaring amidst this dense white sea of bones.</p><br/><p>The surrounding experts were similarly absent minded because of the vast size of this bright red large hall It was a long while later before they recovered. They looked at each other and saw some shaken expression in each other\u2019s eyes. It was indeed worthy of being a place left behind by a Dou Sheng. This grandness was indeed sufficiently majestic and mighty.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwoosh swoosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Numerous figures gradually reduced their speeds before halting a hundred metres from the bright red large hall. The large hall appeared even larger when standing at this place. At a glance, the top of the hall appeared to reach into the clouds.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder it must be covered by a spatial seal. Such a vast hall would be a glaring existence no matter where it was placed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily shook his head when he watched this bright red large hall. He led everyone to slowly land a hundred metres away. That elite Dou Sheng from the ancient times would actually build such an enormous remains. It was likely that he possessed quite a rich foundation. It seemed that this trip would not be wasted.</p><br/><p>At this moment, many experts outside the bright red large hall continuously arrived. However, no one chose to to take the lead in stepping into the hundred metre radius. Those who could arrive at this place were all people from large factions or who possessed great ability. Naturally, no one would be foolish enough to be the one leading the herd at this moment\u2026</p><br/><p>Since these people were not anxiou, Xiao Yan was naturally not anxious. It was likely that only a fool would believe that such a rich treasure did not have any defensive measures.</p><br/><p>While Xiao Yan was crossing his arms over his chest and waiting quietly, he suddenly sensed a pair of icy cold eyes being shot over. His brows was immediately lifted. He turned his gaze and immediately focused it on the origin of those icy cold eyes.</p><br/><p>The owner of those icy cold eyes was a lady in colourful clothes. Her noble demeanor set her off in a manner that no ordinary person would dare to directly look at her. Her phoenix shape hair had also added some nobility to her demeanor.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Qing Er?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s fingers could not resist rubbing against each other when he saw this familiar face. It was unexpected that he could see her in this place.</p><br/><p>Quite a number of people were clustered beside Feng Qing Er. The people from the Wind Lightning Pavilion were amongst them. At this moment, this group of people had clearly discovered Xiao Yan\u2019s group. A densely cold expression flashed across their eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes swept over this group of people. After which, they paused on a spot beside Feng Qing Er. There was a tall white haired man wearing bright clothes at that spot. The man was around thirty or so. However, this kind of age was undoubtedly young for the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe.</p><br/><p>This white haired man was extremely handsome. His smiling face caused him to appear like a blessed person. At one glance, it was possible to tell that he was not an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Er, is that the person whom you have said to have the essence demon phoenix blood?\u201d At this moment, the white haired man also glanced at Xiao Yan and laughed in a faint voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. However, it is unexpected that after having only not meet him for a short couple of years, he had actually reached the Dou Zun class\u2026\u201d Feng Qing Er gritted her silver teeth and spoke unwillingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, Dou Zun huh\u2026 after this, you will also be able to receive the inheritance from the tribe. At that time, it is not impossible to breakthrough to the Dou Zun class.\u201d The white haired man smiled slightly and whispered, \u201cAs for that Xiao Yan, just leave him to me. Regardless of whether he possess the demon phoenix essence blood, we will know if we bring him back for an examination. Even if he had already swallowed the essence blood, we will also have a way to refine it from within his blood\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qing Er nodded slightly. Although Xiao Yan had advanced to the Dou Zun class, she had quite a great confidence towards the person beside her. The latter had received the inheritance earlier than her and was extremely familiar in using the inherited strength. He could be ranked amongst the top ten even amongst all the younger generation within the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe. It should not be too difficult to deal with Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, there is a path to the Heavens which you refuse to take. Instead, you have choose to barge into hell, which does not have a road leading in. If you have remained in the Central Plains, I might not be able to do anything to you. However, you have delivered yourself here. In that case, do not blame this miss for accepting it\u2026\u201d A cold glint flashed across Feng Qing Er\u2019s pretty eyes as she laughed coldly within her heart.</p><br/><p>In the face of this icy cold gaze that Feng Qing Er shot over, Xiao Yan merely took a glance at her before withdrawing his eyes. He could sense the killing intent of that white haired man towards him. Xiao Yan was only slightest surprised at the latter reaching the strength of a Dou Zun at such an age. The Heaven Demon Phoenix was not an ordinary Magical Beast. Being in possession of the Ancient Heaven Phoenix bloodline, they also possess many ways to greatly increase the strength of their tribe members. On the whole, however, this kind of strength that was obtained by relying on their inheritance, ultimately had some gap when compared with his strength, which was obtained from training. This kind of difference was not obvious when one looked at the surface. However, some clues would be revealed when one fought with others.</p><br/><p>With Xiao Yan\u2019s current strength, he basically had the confidence of being victorious when meeting anyone from the younger generation as long as it was not some specially abnormal existence. Back then, this was the case with Yi Chen. Currently, it would be the same with this white haired young man\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shifted his eyes from Feng Qing Er. He looked around him and the expression on his face became a little interesting. This was because he had actually discovered quite a number of familiar faces from the various large factions that had arrived from all directions. Moreover, there were quite a number amongst them that had a great enmity with Xiao Yan\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWind Lightning Pavilion, Heaven Demon Phoenix Tribe, Ice River Valley, Profound Xuan Sect\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes swept over these factions with an enmity against him. In an instant, he involuntarily shook his head and sighed. This time around, he has really entered the wolves\u2019 nest\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

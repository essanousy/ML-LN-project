She was also very curious about Xiao Yan\u2019s background. Although Feng zun-zhe had many friends, she didn\u2019t know of a friend whom he would be so concerned about after all these years\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan tightly clenched his fist. A fierce glint vaguely appeared in his eyes. A moment later he suppressed the fluctuating emotion within his heart. He inhaled a deep breath of air as he slowly said, \u201cOld Feng should also be aware of the matter about teacher back then, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was not with me when something happened to him. By the time I discovered something amiss, Han Feng had already announced to the public that the old fellow had suffered a backlash when he was refining a pill and ended up self-destructing. I will naturally never believe such words, and I interrogated Han Feng quite a number of times about this. However, this fellow is extremely cunning, and I failed to learn anything through my questioning. After this continued a couple of times, he also disappeared from the Central Plains region. Only at that time did I vaguely sense the disappearance of that old fellow was related to him. However, I am unable to find any information about Han Feng after searching the Central Plains for so many years.\u201d Feng zun-zhe\u2019s eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan as he spoke with a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed softly and whispered, \u201cTeacher was indeed harmed by Han Feng back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBoom!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng zun-zhe\u2019s expression almost instantly turned dark, chilly when Xiao Yan\u2019s words sounded. A dense killing intent surged out of his body, causing the temperature of this place to significantly drop.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard, Yao Chen had raised him after he was abandoned as a baby and had taught him all that he knew, yet he dared to betray his teacher? Has his conscience really been eaten by a dog. Back then, the old me should have killed this bastard with a slap!\u201d A fury surged onto Feng zun-zhe\u2019s face as he cried out.</p><br/><p>Mu Qing Luan cowered her neck when she saw Feng zun-zhe this furious. Feng zun-zhe was usually light and carefree. Seldom would he lose himself in such a manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Chen? Could he be that life and death good friend of teacher, the pavilion chief of the Falling Star Pavilion that has never shown himself, Yao Chen, Yao zun-zhe?\u201d Mu Qing Luan muttered this name in her mouth before she immediately seemed to have recalled something. Her pretty eyes were stunned as she looked at Xiao Yan and involuntarily cried out.</p><br/><p>\u201cPavilion chief?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He was unaware that Yao Lao had been Pavilion chief.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Falling Star Pavilion was founded by Yao Chen and me back then. However, he doesn\u2019t like these matters and the place was more or less managed by me. Although he has been missing during these years, the position of pavilion chief still remains because I know that with the old fellow\u2019s ability, he would not die so easily.\u201d Feng zun-zhe waved his hand as he explained.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. It was unexpected that teacher would be the pavilion chief of the Falling Star Pavilion in name. In that case, was he not considered a member of the Falling Star Pavilion?</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about this for now. Once I return, I will issue a wanted order. I think that the bastard Han Feng is still alive. If he lands in my hands, I will definitely let him suffer a fate where he cannot even beg to die!\u201d Feng zun-zhe spoke in a dark manner. It seemed that Han Feng had completely infuriated him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s a wanted order, there is probably no need\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head. He flicked his finger and a jade bottle appeared from his Storage Ring. His finger rubbed over the mouth of the bottle as an illusionary spiritual body was hurriedly released.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, just what will it take for you to let me off\u2026\u201d Han Feng\u2019s soul roared in a flustered and exasperated manner after escaping the bottle. However, his roar had yet to finish when it came to a sudden halt. A frightened expression that was difficult to hide appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Feng!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng zun-zhe\u2019s eyes were dense as he looked at Han Feng\u2019s soul in front of him. Two words that contained a chilly killing intent were slowly emitted between his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng zun-zhe?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng\u2019s eyes were dull as he looked at Feng zun-zhe in front of him. An instant later he immediately let out a shocked scream and hurriedly turn to flee.</p><br/><p>Feng zun-zhe\u2019s eyes were ice-cold. His fingers were curled into claws as he sucked at Han Feng. A frightening suction forcefully pulled Han Feng back. After which, it grabbed Han Feng\u2019s neck like an eagle claw would grab a small animal. That usually benign-looking, old face had become unusually frightening at this moment, \u201cBastard, you dared attack your teacher? If not for Yao Chen, you would have been swallowed by a wild stray. Beast, you aren\u2019t even worthy of being a pig or a dog!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng finally became afraid as he looked at Feng zun-zhe\u2019s eyes, which contained a dense killing intent, that caused one to freeze over. He was also a little afraid of Feng zun-zhe in his heart. Immediately, he hurriedly cried out, \u201cDon\u2019t kill me. This has nothing to do with me. I was also forced by those people from the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHall of Souls?\u201d Feng zun-zhe\u2019s expression changed when he heard this name.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Feng, the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 seem to be after teacher\u2019s Spiritual Strength. Now, teacher has already fallen into their hands.\u201d Xiao Yan spoke in a low and deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really related to those bastards!\u201d Feng zun-zhe grit his teeth as he yelled. During his investigations over these years, he had also vaguely discovered something about the \u2018Hall of Souls.\u2019 However, he had not expected the ones who had struck at Yao Chen back to be these fellows, who lingered around without disappearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard cannot be allowed to live.\u201d A killing intent flashed across his eyes as he stared at Han Feng icily. Even if it was the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 who wanted to strike Yao Chen, it would be extremely difficult for them to do so. After all, Yao Chen had a great number of friends. Quite a number of experts from the older generation back then had quite a good relationship with him. With his identity as an alchemist, his ability to summon help with just a wave of his hand was something that would cause even the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 would have to think twice despite their strength. However, Yao Chen had eventually disappeared in an abrupt manner. Clearly, this was because a traitor had betrayed him, resulting in him lacking the time to gather helpers. Who else could this traitor be other than this bastard Han Feng?</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Feng, wait. We still need Han Feng to guide us in order for us to find the branch hall where Yao Lao is being imprisoned. It is not the right time to kill him.\u201d Xiao Yan hurriedly spoke when he saw this situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is likely that the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 does not only want the old fellow\u2019s soul. Perhaps, they attach a greater value on his ability to refine pills. Back then, I became vaguely aware that the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 seemed to be quietly acting on a grand plan. This plan required quite a number of outstanding alchemists\u2026 during that big fight at the Ancient Mansion, which had turned the entire Central Plains into an uproar, Yao Chen and I had exchanged blows with the \u2018Hall of Souls.\u2019 It is likely that he had caught their eye at that time.\u201d Feng zun-zhe nodded, mused for a moment, and suddenly made a guess.</p><br/><p>\u201cAncient Mansion?\u201d Xiao Yan was stunned when he heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is already an extremely old story. That mansion was passed down from the ancient times. Back then, it attracted over half of the experts of the Central Plains who were at the Dou Zong class and above. However, the treasures inside were indeed shocking. The Qi Method you practice now was obtained by Yao Chen from that place back then.\u201d Feng zun-zhe sighed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was once again startled. He involuntarily inhaled a gentle breath. Flame Mantra was actually something that was obtained from that Ancient Mansion\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is that old fellow being imprisoned right now?\u201d Feng zun-zhe glanced icily at Han Feng before demanding.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe western regions of the Central Plains Underworld City. There is a branch hall of the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 there. Yao\u2026 Yao Chen is being imprisoned there\u2026\u201d Han Feng hesitated for a moment before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderworld City huh. It is unexpected that there is a branch hall of the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 there\u2026\u201d Feng zun-zhe frowned and asked once again. \u201cHow many honorable elders (Dou Zun) are there in that branch?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne.\u201d Han Feng\u2019s eyes quietly flickered as he softly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think that this venerable self (Dou Zun) does not have any understanding of the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019?\u201d Feng zun-zhe laughed coldly when he heard this. \u201cA branch of the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 would at least have a chief and a deputy regardless of how low level it is. They are at the honorable elder level. Moreover, that place is one where someone as important as Yao Chen is imprisoned. One honorable elder. Looks like your evil thoughts have yet to be extinguished.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng\u2019s body trembled slightly when he heard Feng zun-zhe\u2019s words. The expression of Xiao Yan by the side had also slowly turned dark and solemn. Dammit. He had nearly been tricked by this bastard. Two honorable elders\u2026 this was not a matter of summing two up. A lineup consisting of two Dou Zun class experts would have the ability to even wash some top tier factions in the Central Plains in blood. If he had not found Feng zun-zhe and ended up foolishly leading people to Underworld City, it was likely that he would have fallen into their hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cStore him away. He might be useful in the future.\u201d Feng zun-zhe\u2019s eyes were dense as he glanced at Han Feng, who was involuntarily trembling. However, he simply laughed and tossed Han Feng to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head with a cold smile after receiving Han Feng\u2019s soul. He stuffed him back into the jade bottle. With a random flick of his finger, a wisp of invisible flame rushed in, and a sharp miserable cry once again sounded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s finger rubbed the mouth of the bottle and isolated the miserable cry. After which, he returned it to his Storage Ring. He would wait and see if this fellow could survive being burned by the Fallen Heart Flame. When dealing with such scum, he would not allow them to peacefully die.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Feng, what should we do now?\u201d Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe cannot be reckless when dealing with this matter, and we cannot allow any information to be leaked. Otherwise, once the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 transfers Yao Chen, it will be even more difficult for us to find him. You should wait quietly for some time. I will dispatch someone to head to Underworld City to investigate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we delay for too long\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan spoke in a somewhat worried manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, there are not many people who possess pill refining skills that can be compared with Yao Chen in the Central Plains. The \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 will not easily hurt him.\u201d Feng zun-zhe spoke in a calm manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment after hearing this but he could only nod his head. The \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 was too powerful. They really could not afford to alert them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will return to the Falling Star Pavilion next. After which, I will begin investigating the \u2018Hall of Souls.\u2019 What about you?\u201d Feng zun-zhe\u2019s eyes looked at Xiao Yan as he asked.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan mused for a moment before saying, \u201cI wish to head to the middle regions of the Central Plains region. There is still a year or so left until the Pill Tower\u2019s Pill Gathering. I wish to participate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Pill Gathering huh?\u201d Feng zun-zhe was startled when he heard this. He immediately smiled and said, \u201cThis is also not bad. Back then, that old fellow Yao Chen managed to get a champion spot in that Pill Gathering. He was really glorious. Being his disciple, you must naturally not diminish his reputation. Moreover\u2026 according to what I know, the top ten in this Pill Gathering appear to be able to obtain the right to subdue the \u2018Three Thousand Burning Flames.\u2019 Perhaps this possesses a fatal attraction to you.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, when he was still a few dozens of meters from the ground, both of his feet suddenly pressed on the empty air and his body once again stabilized. However, the remnant blood trace on the corner of his mouth and his savage, frightening face still proved that the sudden attack earlier had only caused him some injuries.</p><br/><p>Who could actually turn an elite Dou Zong like Yun Shan into such a miserable state? This thought flashed across the hearts of many people. Their gazes immediately shifted up before finally stopping at the black-robed, young man in the sky\u2026 the somewhat illusionary human figure beside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Their faces were all stunned and at a loss when they saw that illusionary human figure, who was suspended beside Xiao Yan. Clearly, they were extremely unfamiliar with this mysterious expert who had suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>Other people might be unfamiliar with this illusionary figure but the faces of Jia Xing Tian, Hai Bodong, and the others were suddenly filled with joy when they saw the former intervening. The strongest trump card of Xiao Yan had finally appeared. With the help of this mysterious teacher of his, it should not be much of a problem defeating Yun Shan.</p><br/><p>Everyone took the opportunity in the interspace between the battles to exchange looks with one another. All of them saw a hidden joy within the other party\u2019s eyes. From the looks of it, the advantage in this big fight today would gradually shift toward them. As long as Xiao Yan and that teacher of his joined hands to kill Yun Shan, it was likely that the Misty Cloud Sect would fall apart on its own without the need to attack. It would be difficult for it to rise again in the future.</p><br/><p>Compared to the joy of Hai Bodong and the others, the hearts of many Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s disciples and Elders had sunk greatly at this moment. This was especially the case after they saw Yun Shan actually spit out blood and be forced back. An uneasiness instantly surfaced within their hearts. Being the pillar of the Misty Cloud Sect, if Yun Shan were to be defeated today, the impact on the morale of the Misty Cloud Sect would be extremely great.</p><br/><p>Yun Shan naturally did not have time to bother about the different emotions between both parties. At this moment, he was staring intently at the old human figure suspended beside Xiao Yan\u2019s side. A moment later, he slowly wiped off the blood traces on the corner of his mouth as he spoke with a dense, cold voice, \u201cBack then, I faintly felt that this fellow\u2019s strength was a little strange. Only now am I aware that the strength was actually you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao in the sky glanced indifferently at Yun Shan below. He laughed faintly, \u201cHow can I allow you to randomly humiliate and bully my student? You are merely a little Dou Zong. If this were back then, this venerate (refers to a Dou Zun) would only require a single sentence in order to eliminate this Misty Cloud Sect of yours from the Dou Qi Continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>The words from Yao Lao were not an exaggeration to frighten. With his reputation on the continent back then, an ordinary elite Dou Zun would not be able to compare with him. Moreover, he was extremely sociable with many friends. There were even some extremely powerful people who possessed a strength that was comparable with him and had a close relationship with him. Although the Misty Cloud Sect had one elite Dou Zong, the Yao Lao back then would indeed not even be slightly concerned about it.</p><br/><p>This venerate (refers to a Dou Zun)? Yao Lao\u2019s form of address immediately caused Yun Shan\u2019s eyes to shrink slightly. This form of address was something that only an elite Dou Zun was qualified to use. In other words, this old fellow was actually an elite Dou Zun back then?</p><br/><p>The shock in his heart continued for an instant before it slowly faded away. Regardless of how strong Yao Lao was back then, he was merely just a spiritual body at this moment. The fighting strength that he could unleash was not even fifty-percent of his peak. There was no need to be overly afraid of him. Moreover\u2026 he did not need to fight with this person. There was someone who would deal with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are but a mere spiritual body yet you actually dare to act this arrogant. Since you dare to appear today, I will get you to remain here along with Xiao Yan.\u201d Yun Shan suddenly smiled and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy just relying on you?\u201d Yao Lao slowly said. The dense white flame appeared to possess a spirit as it continued to linger up and down around his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, there will naturally be someone to deal with you. Moreover he has been waiting for you for a long time\u2026\u201d Yun Shan laughed. He immediately clapped and the clear sound slowly reverberated over this sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cProtector Wu, I shall hand this person to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>A large cluster of black fog suddenly came from within the grand hall of the Misty Cloud Sect from all directions after Yun Shan\u2019s voice sounded. This black fog swiftly agglomerated in the sky before transforming into a deep profound fog that was over ten feet wide.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and Yao Lao looked at the black fog that had appeared. Their faces simultaneously turned solemn. This damn old dog Yun Shan really was collaborating with the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019...</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, be careful!\u201d Xiao Yan turned his head and spoke to Yao Lao in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao nodded slightly. His eyes did not blink as he looked at the cluster of black fog. The dense white flame that was leaping around him also quietly became much hotter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d There was a commotion that had immediately broken out among the disciples of the Misty Cloud Sect below when the black fog appeared in the sky. Their gazes were filled with surprise. They actually did not notice when such a mysterious person had hidden away within the sect.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun\u2019s pretty face was shocked as she looked at the cluster of black fog from the side of the wedding stage. She could tell that this was not a good person from the way that this fellow had appeared. However, why did he appear within the Musty Cloud Sect? Why did nobody mention it to her in the past? She felt somewhat uneasy as this thought rotated within her heart. Just what was the origin of this faction known as the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019? When did Yun Shan gain a relationship with them?</p><br/><p>The sudden change of events also caused the faces of the originally joyous Hai Bodong and the others to become slightly ugly. They were able to faintly sense that the cluster of black fog was extraordinary. Moreover, the most important thing was that this strange fellow clearly stood on Yun Shan\u2019s side. In this way, their advantage would completely vanish\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJust who is this fellow?\u201d Jia Xing Tian shook and forced back the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s elite Dou Huang with a palm before he cried out in a deep voice to Hai Bodong a short distance away.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Hai Bodong shook his head. He immediately and suddenly moved his body and unleashed a wild and violent attack at the elite Dou Huang who was repeatedly pestering him. \u201cThere is a change in the situation. Let\u2019s hurry up and finish off our opponents and join hands with Xiao Yan to attack Yun Shan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Xing Tian and Fa Ma nodded heavily when they heard this. They did not dare hold anything back at such times of emergency. Their powerful Dou Qi was unleashed to their limits and they used a fierce, powerful attack on their opponents in front of them. Under such vigorous attacks from everyone, the Elders from the Misty Cloud Sect descended into a disadvantage and were repeatedly losing ground. There were also some weaker people who were the first to be killed during this period of time. However, they also gave the other party an attack just before they died, causing quite a bit of damage.</p><br/><p>In an instant, this chaotic battleground and become unusually hot and intense.</p><br/><p>The cluster of black fog was naturally unconcerned about everyone\u2019s thought. A sinister strange laughter was emitted as the black fog rotated continuously, much like a crow\u2019s cry resounding across the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, Yao Chen, it is really unexpected that you will actually come to us. You were lucky to have fled back then and wasted quite a bit of effort from our \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019... the hall\u2019s chief will likely rejoice if I capture you today.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA group of mouse-like monsters. Back then you borrowed the hands of that bastard Han Feng to attack me. I will come and count this debt with you properly!\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s gaze coldly observed the custer of black fog called Protector Wu. His voice was also filled with fury and killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis protector might have been a little afraid of you if you possessed a physical body. However, against a spiritual body, tsk tsk, our \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 have many different method to deal with you\u2026\u201d The black fog rippled and shrank before finally slowly agglomerating into a human figure whose entire body was covered within a black smoke in front of everyone. There was a faint pair of bright-red eyes revealed from the darkness.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s eyes narrowed as they looked at Protector Wu who had appeared in this form. The dense white flame leaped slightly as he spoke to Xiao Yan, \u201cIt is as I have expected. The \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 is hiding within the Misty Cloud Sect. From the looks of it, I am unable to divert myself to help you. This fellow is also not an ordinary person. It is very difficult for me to kill him even if I attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you can just focus entirely on pestering that fellow. I will deal with Yun Shan.\u201d Xiao Yan looked at the serious expression on Yao Lao\u2019s face and knew that it was likely that the big battle today would really force him to use all of his triumph cards. He immediately nodded and spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao sighed softly. The situation today was indeed a little risky\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cProtector Wu, I will leave that Yao Chen to you.\u201d Yun Shan laughed darkly as he looked at the increasingly solemn expression of the two people. Finally, he spoke to Protector Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Protector Wu nodded his head. He immediately glanced at Xiao Yan and said, \u201cYou better not kill this little fellow. Their Xiao clan still possesses something that our \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 needs\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shan frowned slightly when he heard this. He could only nod his head and laugh, \u201cRelax, I will leave him with a breath left.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOur Xiao clan has something that your \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 need?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes immediately shrank when he heard Protector Wu\u2019s words. Thoughts rotated swiftly within his heart. An instant later, his mind moved and he muttered to himself within his heart, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me\u2026 the aim of the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 is that \u2018Tou She Ancient God\u2019s Jade\u2019? They also captured father because of this thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only at this moment did Xiao Yan understood why a mysterious faction like the \u2018Hall of Souls,\u2019 which covered the entire continent, would attack their Xiao clan\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThese bastards\u2026\u201d The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth twitched slightly. He clenched his fist tightly as his gaze stared intently at the strange black fog.</p><br/><p>Protector Wu merely glanced at Xiao Yan\u2019s dense gaze before looking away. His palm moved and a dark-black chain carried a \u2018clang\u2019 sound as it was extended out from his palm. After which, it shook slightly and meandered around his body like a poisonous snake.</p><br/><p>The black-colored chain trembled slightly. A moment later, Protector Wu let out a strange laugh. His hand trembled and the chain instantly broke through the sky and turned into a black line that pierced toward Yao Lao in an explosive manner.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s expression became ice-cold when he saw that Protector Wu had attacked. The dense white flame on his hand writhed and rushed out.</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s dark, dense eyes slowly turned toward Xiao Yan after seeing Protector Wu and Yao Lao clashing together in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bastard, now, I will see who else will come and help you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly exhaled a breath of air as he looked at Yun Shan whose face was filled with a dense, cold killing intent. Since this was the case, he could only use his trump cards!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

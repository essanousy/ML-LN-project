Wave after wave of a mysterious demonic force was emitted from the three rotating jade-green flowers, causing the murderous intent and violence in the Heaven Demon Python\u2019s eyes to gradually fade\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief when he saw the power of the demonic eye. Qing Lin\u2019s Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils possessed an extremely powerful ability to control snake-formed Magical Beasts. However, he was uncertain whether Qing Lin\u2019s current strength would be able to control this Ancient Heaven Demon Python. After all, its strength was equivalent to a five change peak Dou Zun.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss!\u201d</p><br/><p>This thought had just flashed within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart when the eyes of the Heaven Demon Python, which had gradually grown dimmer, began to struggle. Its large body suddenly shook at the same time. Wave after wave of frightening black fog continued to spread from its body. It seemed to have detected Qing Lin\u2019s intention and was resisting in an uncontrolled fashion.</p><br/><p>A ferocious beast that could train to such an extent could not be dealt with so easily regardless of how unintelligent it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed not easy to deal with this beast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shock rose within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart upon sensing that this Ancient Heaven Demon Python was able to rely on its own strength to resist the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils. He immediately threw a punch forward. A large cluster of Heavenly Flames surged out and swiftly lingered around the Ancient Heaven Demon Python\u2019s body, quickly vaporizing the black fog.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuppress it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan cried out in a deep voice when he attacked.</p><br/><p>The Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python formed by Cai Lin in the sky suddenly curled up upon hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s cry. An invisible pressure surged out and poured onto the Ancient Heaven Demon Python. A suppression that originated from deep within its soul immediately caused the black fog on its body to retreat.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the Little Fairy Doctor, Yun Yun, Elder Qing Cheng, and the others unleashed many large Dou Qi pillars. These were like ropes that restricted the Ancient Heaven Demon Python.</p><br/><p>Even though the Ancient Heaven Demon Python was powerful, it was unable to struggle for a moment when faced with such a heavy pressure. Its ferocious mouth continued to emit a furious roar that caused the entire mountain to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Lin, quick!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan cried out upon sensing the untamed struggle of the Ancient Heaven Demon Python.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Lin slightly nodded. She quickly inhaled a deep breath. Both of her hands spread like a blooming lotus as she formed many complicated and mysterious seals. After the formation of these seals, an extremely deep roar was vaguely emitted from her body!</p><br/><p>The space behind Qing Lin became distorted when this roar, which contained a pressure from ancient times, appeared. A ten-thousand-foot-long snake-shaped illusory figure formed. The body of this illusory figure emitted an extremely ancient aura, and it possessed nine snake heads. Surprisingly, it was the nine-headed Heaven Serpent that Xiao Yan had seen back then!</p><br/><p>The wildly struggling Ancient Heaven Demon Serpent\u2019s body shook the moment that nine-headed Heaven Serpent illusory figure appeared. Both of its eyes finally revealed a dense fear. Faced with two ancient snake bloodline\u2019s ancestor pressures, even this extremely violent Heaven Demon Python trembled...</p><br/><p>\u201cTriple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils, demon eye\u2014open!\u201d</p><br/><p>After summoning the nine-headed Heavenly Serpent illusory figure to completely suppress the Heaven Demon Python\u2019s soul, three jade-green flowers suddenly quivered before they slowly bloomed. A jade-green bone-chilling demonic pupil was present at the intersection of the three flowers. It seemed to have awoken as it slowly opened...</p><br/><p>The space in front of Qing Lin cracked the moment this eye was opened. The enormous body of the Ancient Heaven Demon Python stilled in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cStand back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes focused on this demonic eye. His mind immediately became absent as his heart became shocked. He hurriedly released the Heaven Demon Python and quickly pulled back. At the same time he also shouted a warning to everyone.</p><br/><p>The others understood that Qing Lin\u2019s demon eye did not discriminate between enemies and allies when they saw Xiao Yan retreat. They hurriedly scattered and did not dare stand close to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cQing Lin\u2019s Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils are really frightening. If I was someone from the snake tribe, I would have ended up like the Heaven Demon Python\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan withdrew by a great distance. The current Qing Lin was able to control a little of the nine-headed Heaven Serpent\u2019s strength. If she completely summoned the nine-headed Heaven Serpent, she would be even more frightening. After all, the Ancient Heaven Serpent was an existence that could be compared to an Ancient Void Dragon and the Ancient Heaven Phoenix.</p><br/><p>The demonic and unusual eye slowly rotated as a thumb-sized jade-green light ray suddenly erupted from it. This light ray left an imprint on the stiff Heaven Demon Python\u2019s head with lightning-like speed. Immediately, a palm-sized green flower surfaced.</p><br/><p>The remaining violence within the large eyes of the Ancient Heaven Demon Python quickly disappeared when this green flower appeared. A gentle emptiness replaced it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it successful?\u201d</p><br/><p>A joy flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes when he saw the Ancient Heaven Demon Serpent pause in the sky. If Qing Lin was truly able to control this big creature, the strength of their group would undoubtedly soar. The strength of a five change peak Dou Zun was still quite a powerful existence even in this Ancient Wasteland Region.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Lin slowly shut her eyes when the flower was formed. The enormous nine-headed Heaven Serpent's illusory figure behind her also slowly disappeared. That ancient pressure that permeated the sky quietly paled.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The enormous Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python once again transformed into an enchanting figure that hurried down. She used a surprised gaze that glanced at Qing Lin. The nine-headed Heaven Python that Qing Lin had summoned caused even her to feel afraid. This kind of abnormal existence was likely something that only those legendary Nine-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python could content with.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you controlled it?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s body swiftly transformed back to his original form as the golden light surged. He appeared beside Qing Lin and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye. Fortunately, we have exhausted quite a lot of its strength. Additionally, there is elder sister Cai Lin\u2019s spiritual pressure. Otherwise, I would not have been able to subdue this fellow\u2026\u201d Qing Lin laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026 hurry up. Let\u2019s go and find the Heaven Demon Blood Pool.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief. After which, he turned to the enormous mountain with a black fog permeating over it. His eyes vaguely contained some heat. His body moved, and he rushed toward the mountain. After which, Cai Lin, the Little Fairy Doctor, and the rest quickly followed.</p><br/><p>This mountain was extremely dangerous and large, but there were no other ferocious beast living around it. They had all been expelled by this Ancient Heaven Demon Python. This had saved Xiao Yan\u2019s group some trouble, so they followed the energy ripple that was vaguely emitted from the mountain and quickly found the Heaven Demon Python's cave.</p><br/><p>The Heaven Demon Python\u2019s cave was located in the middle of this mountain. It was a dark, cold, and moist place. White bones were piled high and some of these bones were that of humans. It was a wonder just which unlucky people had become food for this Heaven Demon Python.</p><br/><p>The group knit their brows and wandered around these piles of bones before stopping at the end of this cave.</p><br/><p>The end of the cave was scarlet and rocky. There was a hundred-foot-wide pool in the middle of these messy rocks. The interior of the pool was saturated with a scarlet blood. Occasionally, some bloody bubbles would rise from the blood pool. The bloody bubbles burst and an extremely dense energy spread from them\u2026</p><br/><p>Some beast bones were still floating in the blood pool. From the looks of it, that violent Heaven Demon Python had even thrown some ferocious beasts inside\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the Heaven Demon Blood Pool?\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor involuntarily asked. Her skin had turned numb upon seeing this scarlet color.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it should be this thing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. He could sense that the interior of this blood pool contained an extremely dense energy. It seemed that this Heaven Demon Python had put in a great amount of effort in order to form this blood pool. Unfortunately, it had ended up benefitting Xiao Yan\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI might delay for two to three days in this place. Qing Lin, you should summon the Ancient Heaven Demon Python to continue guarding the mountain during this period of time. Even if there are some experts passing by, they will not offend an existence like it for no reason\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan turned to Qing Lin as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Qin Lin nodded after hearing his orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill there be any danger?\u201d Cai Lin glanced at the scarlet blood as she frowned and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, you can rest assured. Although the energy inside is violent, it is not at a level where it cannot be endured\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince this is the case, you should be careful. Send a signal if there is an unexpected change\u2026\u201d Cai Lin was unable to say anything else when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s insistence. She issued an instruction before leading everyone to slowly withdraw.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled when he saw everyone gradually withdraw. Only then did he turn his body. His expression was a little grave as he looked at the pool of blood in front of him. The energy inside was a lot more violent than he had expected. He wondered just what the Heaven Demon Python had thrown in.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy constitution is strong to begin with. Additionally, there is the Dragon Phoenix Ancient Armor hiding in my body. I do not believe that I cannot do anything to this Heaven Demon Blood Pool!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stood beside the blood pool and mused for a moment. He gave a cold smile and pressed his toes on the ground. His body leaped into the blood pool without hesitation. After which, a \u2018splash\u2019 was emitted as he landed in the blood pool.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi chi!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Xiao Yan landed inside the blood pool, the originally quiet Heaven Demon Blood Pool immediately began to boil, countless blood bubbles continued to rise. A thunder-like mysterious sound quietly appeared. It immediately spread into the distance\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

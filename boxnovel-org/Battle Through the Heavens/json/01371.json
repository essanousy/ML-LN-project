All he could do was sigh. Even though he was Xun Er\u2019s father, it was the first time that he had seen Xun Er be this intimate with a man.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should have met Xiao Xuan, right?\u201d Gu Yan faintly asked. He stepped into the moonlight and slowly walked toward the embarrassed Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was a little startled. He hesitated for a moment before replying, \u201cYes, I\u2019ve met him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am able to sense the bloodline strength within your body. It is likely that it should be the last bloodline of the Xiao clan\u2026\u201d Gu Yuan clicked his tongue and sighed. \u201cIt is indeed not easy for Xiao Xuan to do such a thing. He is willing to turn himself into that in order to help the Xiao clan retain its final seed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was silent. He naturally understood that the Heavenly Tomb was an enormous prison. As energy bodies, Xiao Xuan and the others were just prisoners within it. Although they were able to live in another form, they had to endure an endless loneliness.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Gu Yuan, is there no way to help him escape?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s voice was a little soft as he inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, even I do not have the ability to do so. It is rumored that the Heavenly Tomb was created by an elite Dou Di a long time ago. If one wishes to break the rules within it and allow Xiao Xuan to escape, perhaps\u2026 one must also reach that level.\u201d Gu Yuan shook his head. Xiao Yan could clearly sense the complicated expression on Gu Yuan\u2019s face when he mentioned the words \u2018Dou Di.\u2019 This class was like a heavy burden that pressed on the souls of the people from the ancient clans. It drove all of them to put in all their effort.</p><br/><p>\u201cDou Di\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan bitterly laughed. This kind of legendary existence was really too unimaginable. Even Gu Yuan in front of him, who could be called one of the true top experts in the Dou Qi continent, would likely only have a heart filled with fear and respect because of these two simple words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes this world truly have an existence known as Dou Di?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan became quiet when he heard Xiao Yan\u2019s question. A moment later, he finally muttered to himself, \u201cThis\u2026 who knows. One would be like a god overlooking the continent at that level. Everyone will likely be ant-like existences in their[a] eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTheir[b]?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. However, he was not aware what Gu Yuan\u2019s words meant. Was this so-called \u201ctheir\u201d merely illusory or did it truly refer to some existence?</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan waved his large hand while Xiao Yan was considering the answer. He said, \u201cYou will be leaving tomorrow. Be careful. Given your current strength, those Elders from the Gu clan are unlikely to make things overly difficult for you. However, due to the matter of the Ling clan, Xun Er will not be able to leave the Gu Realm for the time being\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded and replied, \u201cDoes Elder Gu Yuan think that the change in the Ling Realm this time around is the result of a man-made or a natural disaster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan frowned in the face of Xiao Yan\u2019s question. He replied, \u201cWe are not very sure about this, but I think that they have met with a great trouble. The chances of it being caused by man is very low. After all, the Ling clan\u2019s strength could be ranked among the super factions on the continent. Even the Gu clan has difficulty forcing them to such an extent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if it was the Hun clan?\u201d Xiao Yan slowly asked. Back in the Heavenly Tomb, Xiao Xuan had said that the Hun clan was far too mysterious. Even though the Xiao clan and the Hun clan had been enemies for many years, the members of the clan did not dare to say that they completely understood this mysterious clan.</p><br/><p>Gu Yuan was startled upon hearing this. Immediately, he shook his head once again and replied, \u201cIt is likely impossible. If the Hun clan wished to force the Ling clan until such an extent, it would definitely have to launch a big campaign. Therefore, it is impossible for the Gu clan to not receive any information. Additionally, even if the Hun clan possess such an ability, why would they become enemies with a faction as powerful as the Ling clan for no reason? Although the Ling clan has declined during these years, it is still not a faction that is easy to deal with\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. However, the doubt in his heart increased. If it was not the Hun clan, what other faction could force the Ling clan into such a state? Could it really be due to some natural disaster?</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. These matters are not very related to you. I think that the truth will come out after an investigation\u2026\u201d Gu Yuan waved his hand. He looked at the quiet bamboo house and continued in a soft helpless voice, \u201cAdditionally, you should not forget about the matters you promised me\u2026 Xun Er\u2019s bloodline is very important to the Gu clan. If any problems occur, those old fellows will become furious even if I do not do anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was a little embarrassed when he heard these words. He bitterly smiled and immediately nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright it is already quite late. You should rest. You still have to leave tomorrow morning\u2026\u201d Gu Yuan nodded after seeing Xiao Yan nod. His body gradually paled before completely disappearing.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan helplessly sighed as he stared at the spot where Gu Yuan disappeared. He clicked his tongue and felt as though he had not expressed himself sufficiently...</p><br/><p>When the morning sunlight scattered over this vast space the next morning, this mountain range, which had been quiet for the night, once again became lively. The sound of rushing wind continued to appear\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and Xun Er walked out of the bamboo house when the mountain range became noisy. After which, they flew to the edge of the mountain range where a couple of enormous battleships were suspended in the air. Dark clouds rolled around, giving them a mighty appearance.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes swept around him after he had appeared in the air. He found quite a number of familiar figures. Ling Quan, Lin Xiu, and the other top experts among the younger generation of the Gu clan were present. However, these people dodged his eyes with some fear. Currently, Xiao Yan\u2019s strength had soared to the peak of an eight star Dou Zun. This allowed them to understand that they had lost any qualification to be arrogant in front of Xiao Yan. After all, when Xiao Yan was only a five star Dou Zun back then, he was able to defeat the eight star Dou Zun Gu Yao. Even less needed to be said now that his strength had soared.</p><br/><p>Currently, the only ones among the younger generation of the Gu clan who could fight with him were Xun Er or perhaps Gu Qing Yang.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan detected a pair of eyes focusing on him while he was scanning the area. He immediately shifted his eyes before finally pausing them on a mountain a short distance away. A figure was standing against the wind at that spot. His black and white hair revealed his identity, Gu Yao, who bad been defeated by Xiao Yan half a year ago.</p><br/><p>The eyes of those two met in the air. Surprisingly, no rich sparks erupted. Gu Yao\u2019s face was indifferent, and he slowly nodded to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was a little stunned when he saw Gu Yao\u2019s slightly friendly action. Xiao Yan smiled and nodded in return. From the looks of it, Gu Yao had walked out of the shadow of his failure. A young person of his talent would definitely be groomed by the Gu clan. His future potential would be extraordinary. Xiao Yan would have one less hidden trouble if he could maintain a good relationship with him. It was ultimately better for Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Although this Gu Yao also had feelings for Xun Er, he could be considered the type of person who could accept whatever came his way. This kind of character was rather upright.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo ao!\u201d</p><br/><p>With an increasing number of people hurrying over, a horn sounded from the battleships in the sky. Clearly, they were about to send all these people out of the Gu Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A figure suddenly walked through the air when Xiao Yan was planning to say goodbye to Xun Er. Xiao Yan swept his eyes over, only to discover that this person was Yao Xing Ji of the Yao clan. He knit his brows and indifferently asked, \u201cIs there something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan did not really like this Yao Xing Ji in his heart. Hence, he was not as courteous to Yao Xing Ji as he was to others.</p><br/><p>Yao Xing Ji curled his lips when he noticed Xiao Yan\u2019s indifferent question. His heart felt quite displeased, but due to Xiao Yan\u2019s current strength, he did not utter any mocking words. He flicked his finger and an emerald-colored jade token shot toward Xiao Yan. \u201cThis is the invitation of our Yao clan\u2019s clan ceremony. Don\u2019t frown. Your teacher will require it. He understands what the clan ceremony of the Yao clan represents. Trust me, he will come regardless of what kind of unhappiness he has with the Yao clan,\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan received the emerald jade token. He stared at Yao Xing Ji for a moment but did not return the token. Instead, he put the jade token into his Storage Ring. Subsequently, he cupped his hands together, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time, I was not able to compete with you in terms of alchemy skills. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity to do so next time\u2026\u201d Yao Xing Ji cupped his fist. After which, he ceased saying anything else as he moved and swiftly boarded a battleship.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan played with some thoughts after seeing Yao Xing Ji leave. Regardless of what this so-called Yao clan\u2019s clan ceremony was, he would deliver the message to teacher first. Whether he would attend would completely depend on teacher\u2019s intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cXun Er, it\u2019s time. I should be leaving\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan turned his head, looked at Xun Er beside him, and softly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care\u2026\u201d Xun Er slightly smiled and gently replied.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded with a grin. He did not delay any longer as he waved his hand and turned around. His body transformed into a light figure that leaped onto a battleship in a free and easy manner. Finally, he disappeared in front of everyone\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Xun Er sighed in a lonely manner as she watched Xiao Yan\u2019s disappearing back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo ao!\u201d</p><br/><p>With an increasing number of people rushing onto the battleships, the siren once again resounded. Immediately, dark clouds churned and the battleships slowly shook. Finally, they turned into dark clouds in front of numerous eyes. They contained a shocking momentum as they swiftly flew toward the exit of Gu Realm.</p><br/><p>[a]Their</p><br/><p>[b]Should use their in the paragraph above for this to make more sense.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

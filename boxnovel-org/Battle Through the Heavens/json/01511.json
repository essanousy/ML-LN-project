Its speed was frightening, and with a flash, it traveled across space itself. Even the magma sea region below had been forcefully split, creating a couple-thousand-foot-large magma pit\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The body of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame and the black light pillar were caught in a stalemate. The Heavenly Flame sensed an extremely mysterious decomposition force erupting from the light pillar. The flame on the surface of his body became a little dimmer while facing this strength. A miserable cry that contained a great fury echoed across the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Faced with the strange energy within the black light pillar, even the heart of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame sensed a hint of danger. Its body abruptly swelled and transformed into a fire body that was ten thousand feet in size. The temperature of the surroundings rose. The magma below bubbled as numerous magma pillars continued to erupt. The rumbling sounds that were emitted seemed to herald the end of the world.</p><br/><p>The black light pillar formed circular ripples as this Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame put up a resistance. It even became slightly distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, pour your strength into the formation. Otherwise, all of us will die if it manages to break the seal!\u201d The hall chief roared out loud. His expression changed upon seeing this distortion.</p><br/><p>The hand seal of the chief of the Hall of Souls changed after this roar sounded. He maneuvered the vast and mighty Dou Qi within his body to pour into the formation. The remaining individuals hesitated upon feeling his Dou Qi. They clenched their teeth and quickly poured all the Dou Qi within their bodies into the large formation.</p><br/><p>The formation quickly widened upon receiving the aid of so much Dou Qi. The dark-black light pillar became purer. The strange energy within it also became more terrifying\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTrying to seal me? Who do you think you are!\u201d</p><br/><p>A furious roar reverberated from that enormous flame as it sensed the growing strength around it. The flame within the light pillar suddenly exploded without any warning. Wave after wave of annihilation forces ruthlessly smashed into the dark-black light pillar.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug!\u201d</p><br/><p>The crazy retaliation of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame caused the chief of the Hall of Souls\u2019 group to turn pale. A mouthful of fresh blood shot out of their bodies. Their expressions became slightly weary at this moment. This battle with the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame had been overly hot and intense. Even they were unable to continue on.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, fight it out with it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief of the Hall of Souls wiped the trace of blood off the corner of his mouth. A ferocious expression surged onto his originally ordinary face. He bit the tip of his tongue. A mouthful of essence blood shot out and entered the light pillar.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug!\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of the others changed upon seeing that the chief of the Hall of Souls was willing to lose his essence blood. Finally, they violently clenched their teeth and also spat out a mouthful of essence blood into the light pillar.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi chi chi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Light suddenly surged from the light pillar after the seven individuals began an all out attack. Everyone watched as the enormous body of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame began to rapidly shrink. Although the Heavenly Flame continued to emit waves of furious roars, it was unable to stop its shrinking body.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianluo Sealing Demon Formation, seal!\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief of the Hall of Souls rejoiced upon seeing the flame\u2019s shrinking body. His hand seal hurriedly changed before he finally let out a stern cry.</p><br/><p>The black light pillar that spanned between the sky and the earth began to shrink after the cry sounded. Within a short instant, it turned into a ten-foot-large circular pillar. A cream-white flame slowly rose within the circular pillar as a frightening temperature quietly spread.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccess\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s hearts felt some joy upon seeing this cream-white flame. After having experienced an intense battle between seven four-star Dou Shengs, they had finally sealed the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes focused on the black light pillar. He swiftly refocused them a moment later and his eyes swept over the chief of the Hall of Souls. At this moment, everyone in his group was covered in injuries. Their auras were sluggish. The big battle with the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame earlier had exhausted them.</p><br/><p>A temporarily silence appeared in the sky after the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was sealed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, this cooperation is really a delightful one. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame has finally been sealed and a disaster that could have befallen the Central Plains has been averted\u2026 thank you very much!\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief of the Hall of Souls recuperated slightly before taking the lead to laugh out loud. He cupped his hands to Zi Yan\u2019s group. The other people\u2019s tight hearts relaxed after seeing him thank everyone. However, everyone had just relaxed when a strange smile flashed across the face of the chief of the Hall of Souls. His hand suddenly grabbed at the black light pillar and the pillar flew toward him with lightning-like speed. \u201cHa ha, thank you everyone for today. My Hun clan will remember everyone\u2019s favor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is indeed not a good person!\u201d</p><br/><p>His actions caused everyone to feel startled, but they quickly recovered before furious curses echoed through the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, how can it be this easy to snatch the demonic flame?\u201d</p><br/><p>An icy-cold cry suddenly rang out when the black light pillar was dozens of feet from the chief of the Hall of Souls. The space around the light pillar became distorted as the direction it was headed changed. After which, it flew to the left of the chief of the Hall of Soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>The chief of the Hall of Souls became furious after seeing the demonic flame, which had almost reached his hand, fly away. His eyes were dark and cold as he glared at Zi Yan, who had intervened. Zi Yan was well-versed in spatial strength. Even though she was not in her best condition, she could still distort space and change the direction of the light pillar.</p><br/><p>The chief of the Hall of Souls might have been furious in his heart, but he did not attack Zi Yan at this moment. Instead, he hurriedly turned his head and cried out to Hun Feng and the deputy hall chief, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t the both of you snatching the demonic Flame?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack!\u201d</p><br/><p>The change had occurred suddenly, but it had not exceeded Xiao Yan\u2019s expectations. He had been aware that a conflict would immediately erupt after the temporarily alliance. This rushed unification was the weakest collaboration possible. The hands of friendship from cooperating earlier did not pose even the slightest hindrance in the face of the temptation of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame!</p><br/><p>Hence, deep shouts were made the moment the chief of the Hall of Souls yelled out. Xiao Yan\u2019s green and red bone wings swiftly appeared. These wings were flapped and Xiao Yan appeared in front of the black light pillar. He extended his hand and grabbed it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are seeking death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s hand had just been extended when a dark and cold voice sounded above his head. This voice belonged to the deputy hall chief, who had been observing the situation.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart trembled upon sensing the wind flowing above his head. His hand turned from a claw to a palm as he slammed it into the light pillar, sending it in the direction of Xun Er\u2019s group. At the same time, he suddenly pointed a finger toward the sky!</p><br/><p>\u201cYellow Spring Finger!\u201d</p><br/><p>An enormous energy finger swiftly formed before it collided head-on with the deputy hall chief. An energy storm spread as the two staggered back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is the demonic flame essence. Quickly snatch it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Almost everyone reacted to the situation at this moment. Many fiery hot eyes landed on the dancing black light pillar in the sky. The demonic flame essence had been sealed within it. The strength of whoever managed to obtain it would undoubtedly soar!</p><br/><p>\u201cSwoosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Numerous pairs of eyes stared at the black light pillar with a fiery heat. Within a short instant, the rushing sound of wind appeared throughout the sky. Almost all the experts who were still alive unleashed their agility skills as they grabbed at the black light pillar.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, I have obtained the demonic flame essence!\u201d</p><br/><p>An old high level Ban Sheng in yellow robes managed to grab the black light pillar with his hands amid this free-for-all, but his loud laugh had barely sounded before ten sharp palm winds ruthlessly smashed into his body. Half of his body blasted into a bloody fog as a sharp miserable screech replaced the laughter in the sky.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan knit his brows upon seeing this chaotic scene. He waved his hand and two jade bottles swiftly flew out. They landed in Zi Yan\u2019s and Gu Nanhai\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, recover your internal injuries!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan cried out to the two of them. Currently, the experts whose strength had crossed the fourth star of the Dou Sheng class were a little weak. Hence, they had not intervened even until now. Whoever was the first to act would undoubtedly be more likely to snatch the demonic flame essence.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan and Gu Nanhai did not utter any unnecessary words after receiving the medicinal pills. They immediately consumed them and recovered their Dou Qi. Of course, they still needed to be wary of their surroundings to avoid a preemptive strike by others.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan turned his head to look at the chaotic region. A glow flashed within his eyes as the green-red bone wings on his back were flapped. His speed became many times faster than these ordinary Dou Shengs. Within a couple of flashes, he had charged into the crowd, but the deputy chief of the Hall of Souls swiftly rushed over like a ghost before Xiao Yan could act again. Clearly, the deputy chief was targeting him.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out a cold cry after sensing the deputy chief intervene once again. A thought passed through his heart and the fire slave, which he had been subdued temporarily, charged forward without due care for its life. Xun Er, Gu Qing Yang, Yao Lao, and the others also attacked together from around the fire slave. In an instant, they got entangled with the advanced three star Dou Sheng deputy hall chief.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwoosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan flapped both of his wings while the deputy hall chief was stopped. He appeared beside the light pillar and grabbed it, but he discovered that the light pillar did not move when he tried to pull on it. His eyes turned cold as he leaned his head to the side. There was a black-robed young man staring at him with indifferent dark eyes from the other side of the light pillar\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHun Feng\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face slowly became icy upon seeing this person.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere has never been someone who has been able to snatch something from my hands.\u201d Hun Feng stared at Xiao Yan and spoke with a dense smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan curled his mouth upon hearing this. He threw his palm over in the process.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will be someone from now on!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

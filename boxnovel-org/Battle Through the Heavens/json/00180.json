Ice Emperor!</u></strong></p><br/><p>Eyeing the old man in front of him who was covered in a layer of demonic and mysterious white ice, Xiao Yan heaved a sigh of relief. He waved his hand apologetically at the old man before turning around and leaving.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoy, I really underestimated you.\u201d Just as Xiao Yan was turning his body, the tired voice of the old man was released from the layer of ice.</p><br/><p>Pausing his footsteps, Xiao Yan tilted his head and watched the old man in the layer of ice slowly open his eyes. However, Xiao Yan didn\u2019t feel any panic in his heart. This was because he knew that with the strength the old man currently had, it was impossible for him to break out of the barrier that Yao Lao had placed.</p><br/><p>Sighing, Xiao Yan bitterly smiled, \u201cOld sir, I have already said that I do not have any intention of becoming enemies with you. It is just that this thing is really important to me, therefore\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, it is really unexpected that after living in isolation here for over twenty years, I would actually be thrown into such a dire state by a kid today. It really is somewhat sad.\u201d The old man\u2019s voice was a little desolated. A moment later, however, his tone suddenly changed. His gaze passed through the demonic and mysterious layer of ice and stared at Xiao Yan outside. He said blandly, \u201cBoy, is this map fragment very important to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was briefly silent before nodding his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha.\u201d Seeing his action, the old man let out a laugh. His smile was somewhat strange.</p><br/><p>Frowning, Xiao Yan ignored him as he turned around and walked toward the exit.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, after I spent all my effort in the desert to obtain this map fragment, I used all my years of experience in making maps to perfectly split it into two. One of them has just been taken by you, the other piece\u2026 hee hee.\u201d The old man coldly laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s footsteps paused. With his back facing the old man, his finger tapped on the storage ring. The fragment map piece from before quickly appeared in his palm. After Xiao Yan placed it in front of his eyes to take a look, he realized that the size of this fragment map piece was approximately half the size of the one he found in the cave on the Magic Beast Mountain Range.</p><br/><p>Holding the map fragment in his hand, Xiao Yan\u2019s expression became a little ugly. He was a little frustrated that after putting in so much effort, he had only obtained half of a map fragment.</p><br/><p>Letting out his breath, Xiao Yan carefully stored the map fragment into the storage ring and slowly turned around. He coldly eyed the old man and said, \u201cYou could have chosen to not reveal this secret and that I would not take your life. But now, you\u2019ve said it\u2026 you, are you forcing me to kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. Boy, don\u2019t use death to threaten me. Having lived most of my life, what kind of difficulties have I not faced. When I was dominating within the Jia Ma Empire, you had yet to be born! Do you think that I would be afraid of this little threat? Moreover, if I die, even if you have some great ability, you would not be able to find the other small map fragment. Hehe, when that time comes, with one small map fragment missing, you would not be able to find the treasure the map leads to even if you can complete the map.\u201d The old man said with disdain as he faced Xiao Yan\u2019s cold voice that was filled with killing intent.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes as a cold glint flashed across it. He gently took in a breath, tightened his fist and blandly said, \u201cSay. What do you want to do? Since you are willing to reveal this secret, you cannot be so foolish as to merely use it to anger me, can you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really have quite a good mind. I\u2019m really curious just which abnormal old guy is your teacher. I dare not say anything now but I am certain that you will be standing at the peak of the Jia Ma Empire ten years later.\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s calm manner, the old man could not help but praise.</p><br/><p>Without accepting or denying this high praise by the old man, Xiao Yan glanced at him and said with a frown, \u201cSay it. What do you want before you are willing to hand over that other small map fragment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you release me from this layer of ice? Of course, that is if you aren\u2019t afraid that I will retaliate.\u201d The old man said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes as he stared at the old man. A moment later, he gradually closed his eyes before opening it. Slowly walking forward, his palm gently touched the layer of ice and shook slightly. A thread of thick white flames was inserted into the ice, swiftly melting away the demonic and mysterious layer of ice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can lock you up once, I will be able to do it a second time. So, don\u2019t try any tricks. Otherwise, it will be your blood that will become ice the next time around.\u201d With the wave of his hand, Xiao Yan broke away this demonic and mysterious layer of ice that even a Dou Ling could do nothing about. His pair of dark black eyes suddenly became profound and experienced once again.</p><br/><p>After breaking the ice layer, Xiao Yan\u2019s head moved slightly back. The profoundness swiftly disappeared from his eyes. Gradually lowering his head and watching the old man who was repeatedly shivering after breaking out of the ice, he said, \u201cSay it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a frightening icy cold flame. If I guess correctly, the flame that you had just used should be one of the magical \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019s, right?\u201d The old man said in a horrified voice as his pale face continued to shiver.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lifted his eyes but was did not comment.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s manner, an obvious joy appeared in the old man\u2019s eyes. However, a moment later, the joy was swiftly suppressed. Voicing his thought, he said, \u201cYou already know that my original strength was that of a Dou Huang, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you know my identity?\u201d The old man once again asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan shake his head, the old man also helplessly did the same. However, his face swarmed with pride as he said, \u201cMy name is Hai Bodong. You may not have heard of this name but I think you should have heard of my other name.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIce Emperor!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard the two words \u2018Ice Emperor\u2019, Xiao Yan first stilled. Quickly following that, his face clearly changed. His gaze carried a bizarre expression as he observed the old man who had been continuously suppressed by him. Although Xiao Yan had always been staying at Wu Tan City in the past, he was not unfamiliar with this strong person who was once extremely well known within the Jia Ma Empire.</p><br/><p>Ice Emperor, a member of the previous generation of the Top Ten in the Jia Ma Empire. He was both prideful and introverted while being extremely good at using Ice type Dou Qi. Once, in anger, he had sealed an entire city in ice. Back then, he was one of the few Dou Huangs among the Ten Strong. Later on, he had a huge fight at the peak of the Misty Cloud Mountain with the previous leader of the Misty Cloud Sect. Although he was finally defeated, his opponent had a very difficult victory. During the last time Jia Ma Empire and Chu Yun Empire held a convention for the strong, he single handedly fought a Dou Huang and a Dou Wang from the other side and was not defeated, shocking all present.</p><br/><p>After the last convention for the strong, Ice Emperor gradually disappeared from the sight of many people. Now, the name Ice Emperor only existed personally in the memories of the older generation. The current generation of the top ten had already replaced their fame and glory.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had never expected that this old man, who did not have a very pleasing appearance, would actually be the Ice Emperor who had once caused the upper echelons of the Dou Zhes in the Chu Yun Empire to have a headache. This kind of drama like result made him feel a little stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, luckily my old name has not vanished with time. You actually have heard of it\u2026\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s stunned expression, Hai Bodong laughed in a somewhat pleased manner.</p><br/><p>Gradually inhaling a breath, Xiao Yan sighed, \u201cIndeed it is an answer that shocked me. I did not expect that the Dou Huang whose name had reverberated throughout the Jia Ma Empire would actually be living in isolation in the desert area as a shop owner selling maps.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you end up like that? The strength that you displayed earlier seemed to be only that of a Dou Ling, right?\u201d Xiao Yan curiously asked.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Hai Bodong bitterly nodded his head and sighed, \u201cBack then, after attending the convention between the empires, I came to the Tager Desert. By accident, I obtained the map fragment but I attracted the emperor of the Snake People, Queen Medusa who chased me with the intention to kill. You should know that the strength of Queen Medusa can be ranked among the peak among the Dou Huangs. Was it not for the Snake People having only this one strong person, they might have long ago tried to attack the human empires.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that battle, I was defeated by her hands without question. Although I found a chance to escape in the end, I was struck by her Curse of the Snakes Seal. Not only did my body quickly become old, even my strength was sealed to the level of a Dou Ling.\u201d Hai Bodong sighed, \u201cIn all these years, I have been hiding here, studying the secret of the map fragment and hoping to obtain something that could undo my seal. However, this map fragment is merely a small part of the map. No matter how experienced I am, I cannot crack it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou aren\u2019t think of getting me to break the seal for you, are you?\u201d Xiao Yan said as he narrowed his eyes and twitched his eyebrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 you really think too highly of me. I don\u2019t have that ability.\u201d Shaking his head, Xiao Yan laughed dryly. He did not dare bear such a heavy responsibility.</p><br/><p>\u201cOver the last few decades, I have obtained a medicinal formula that can break the seal. As long as you refine the medicinal pill on it, I will be able to regain my strength.\u201d Hai Bodong said gravely.</p><br/><p>\u201c... I think you should go and find Pill-King Gu He. In the entire Jia Ma Empire there should not be many people who can beat him in refining medicine. I am merely a tier two alchemist.\u201d Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders and said helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe won\u2019t do.\u201d Hai Bodong shook his head and said with a bitter smile, \u201cThe key requirement for refining this kind of medicinal pill is that the alchemist must possess a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019... Pill-King Gu He, doesn\u2019t appear to have that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Yan felt a little shocked in his heart. What kind of medicinal pill would have such a stringent requirement?</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, I would not tell you about the news on the other small map fragment, However\u2026 the thick white flame that you displayed in the end led me to change my mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you can refine the medicinal pill that I need, I will hand over that small map fragment to you. At the same time, I, Ice Emperor Hai Bodong, would also owe you a favor. You ought to know\u2026 how much a favor from a Dou Huang is worth\u2026\u201d Hai Bodong said seriously.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan\u2019s heart was slightly interested. He softly inquired, \u201cWhat is the tier of the medicinal pill you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTier six.\u201d Hai Bodong licked his lips and said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Rolling his eyes, Xiao Yan helplessly waved his hand. \u201cTier six\u2026 even if I possess a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, I am but a tier two alchemist. How could I possibly refine a medicinal pill of that grade?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI believe that your strength is not the little bit that you display on the surface\u2026\u201d When faced with Xiao Yan\u2019s helplessness, Hai Bodong cunningly smiled as he said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed and became quiet. In his heart, he softly asked, \u201cTeacher, what do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of what happens, that map fragment that is related to the \u2018Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame\u2019 is something we must obtain. It will play an extremely crucial role in evolving your Qi Method in the future!\u201d Yao Lao mused and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou mean\u2026 we say yes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, promise him first. In any case, a favor from a Dou Huang is worth this price.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I am worried that once this old man regains his strength, then\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan rotated his eyes and cautiously said.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeke, relax. With me around, even if he recovered his strength, he would not be able to snatch the map fragment back. Moreover\u2026 when refining the medicinal pill, can we not make some preparations for the unexpected?\u201d Yao Lao smiled faintly and said.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan heaved a sigh of relief. He raised his head to watch Hai Bodong whose face was filled with anticipation. Nodding his head, he smiled and said, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll agree.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

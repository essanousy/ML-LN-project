Normal methods of getting to 7 Duan Qi required a period of rest and recovery. However, Xiao Yan did not need it since he had the Foundation Elixir. He was already in peak condition.</p><br/><p>After lying in the basin for a while, until his excited emotions calmed, Xiao Yan finally lazily got up. The attached water droplets sparkled joyously under the bright sunshine.</p><br/><p>Taking a lazy stretch, Xiao Yan\u2019s bones gave crisp cracks as if they were brand new!</p><br/><p>Carelessly turning his head, Xiao Yan\u2019s right hand locked onto his bed and pulled his clothes into his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice. My Dou Qi increased by quite a bit. I should be able to influence someone\u2019s actions now, right?\u201d Xiao Yan muttered as he dressed himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, this \u2018Vacuum Hand\u2019 doesn\u2019t have any power when attacking. \u2018Sucking Blood from One\u2019s Enemy\u2019 applies only to people with weaker Dou Qi than me. For anyone with greater Dou Qi than me, it\u2019d be among the worst to use.\u201d</p><br/><p>Contemplating the negative effects of \u201cVacuum Hand\u201d, Xiao Yan sighed in disappointment. However, even if the technique was terrible, it was the first Dou Technique that he had ever owned!</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to step out of the basin, a thought came to him. He pursed his lips.</p><br/><p>Eyes gleaming, Xiao Yan slowly curled his right hand into a fist and raised his arm so that his hand was about half a foot away from a flower vase. He stared intently at his hand, and deliberately avoided looking at his target.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s Dou Qi burst from his palm without the guidance of Qi.</p><br/><p>Licking his lips, Xiao Yan\u2019s Dou Qi burst out of his palm without any planned Qi Paths or pressure points\u2026.</p><br/><p>To be able to externalize Dou Qi without the use of Qi Paths was something the Da Dou Shi could barely do. Xiao Yan\u2019s attempt resulted in nothing more than a moderate gust of wind.</p><br/><p>The air flowed from his palm and connected with the vase, almost knocking it off the table.</p><br/><p>Even though he failed to externalize the Dou Qi, Xiao Yan\u2019s face bore an expression of elation. He excitedly rubbed his hands together and quickly took a few steps back before raising his hand at the vase again.</p><br/><p>\u201cVacuum Hand!\u201d A small roar and a huge pulling force forced the flower vase to spiral towards Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Right when the vase was about 3 feet away from Xiao Yan, the pulling force on Xiao Yan\u2019s hand disappeared and was replaced by Dou Qi rapidly trying to externalize on his palm. Suddenly, a huge gust of wind blew against the approaching vase!</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two counteracting forces met in mid air and the vase that was in the middle of the clash suddenly broke into countless ceramic pieces.</p><br/><p>TL: Man, Xiao Yan hates vases.</p><br/><p>Seeing the results of his experimentation, Xiao Yan\u2019s small face was full of happy surprise. The combination of the pulling and pushing force caused a destruction far greater than he had imagined.</p><br/><p>Even though Xiao Yan\u2019s plentiful Dou Qi had almost been exhausted by that experiment, Xiao Yan was still extremely excited. The pushing force was caused through a low level method which had a great consumption of Dou Qi with barely mediocre results. If he had a Dou Technique that was the opposite of Vacuum Hand, then the two combined, he was sure, would have a great effect!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, pretty good...To have thought up this method to strengthen Vacuum Hand.\u201d The black ring sparkling, Yao Lao ghostly floated out and praised Xiao Yan while inspecting the ceramic fragments.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and his eyes quickly circled around Yao Lao. On Xiao Yan\u2019s face was an expression of sadness and fawning.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there was a Dou Technique that would create a pushing effect and if you could train that Dou Technique to a high level then this Low Xuan level Vacuum Hand could have the power of a Middle to High Xuan Technique\u2026.\u201d As if he didn\u2019t see Xiao Yan\u2019s fawning face, Yao Lao muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you know that non-attack oriented Dou Techniques are super rare. Getting the Vacuum Hand was pure luck and now, where do you expect me to find a Dou Technique to compliment Vacuum Hand?\u201d Xiao Yan tilted his head and said dejectedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop making that innocent face. I know that you're trying to get it from me!\u201d Giving Xiao Yan an evil eye, Yao Lao angrily said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not like someone else didn\u2019t think of what you just thought up but these two non-attack oriented Dou Techniques are extremely rare and therefore, no one has been able to actually combine their effects.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven teacher doesn\u2019t have something?\u201d Hearing that, Xiao Yan\u2019s small faced darkened. He knew that without a set technique to produce a pushing force, he would have to rely on his Dou Qi externalizing which was not a smart move.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s dispirited face, Yao Lao smiled while massaging his forehead. After a while, he said: \u201cThere was someone before that begged me for a pill. I think that I took a Dou Technique like Vacuum Hand as payment. If I didn\u2019t have an already finished pill at that time, I would not have traded with that person! Hmm, this was pretty long ago, if you didn\u2019t remind me today, then I probably would have really forgotten about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright...I found it!\u201d Moving his finger from his forehead, Yao Lao placed his finger on Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>With the finger, a huge influx of information overwhelmed Xiao Yan and only after a while did Xiao Yan finally understand the new glob of information.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Palm: Low Xuan Level, Able to create huge gusts!\u201d</p><br/><p>The simple explanation along with the uncreative name made this Low Xuan Level technique seem extremely shabby.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe founder of this was a blacksmith who had been a blacksmith for his entire life. Because of the fire of the furnace, after a couple decades, he invented this technique\u2026\u201d Watching the tight faced Xiao Yan, Yao Lao taunted.</p><br/><p>Rolling his eyes, Xiao Yan was quite impressed with the blacksmith. Creating a Dou Technique was no mean feat and definitely not something that an ordinary hammer wielding blacksmith could create.</p><br/><p>Fire Palm wasn\u2019t hard to learn and under Yao Lao\u2019s help, Xiao Yan only took two hours before having an introductory grasp on the basics of it.</p><br/><p>Standing in his room, Xiao Yan stared at the final flower vase in his room. Taking a deep breath and curling his hand, he said: \u201cVacuum Hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>With the strong pull, the flower vase quickly flew towards Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Staring at the incoming vase, Xiao Yan quickly stopped using Vacuum Hand and forced his Dou Qi to follow the Qi Paths of Fire Palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Palm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Right when the vase was about to hit Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead, a strong gust of wind emerged from Xiao Yan\u2019s hand and suddenly the room was subjected to a wind on par with a hurricane!</p><br/><p>\u201cPeng!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another crisp sound of a vase breaking sounded but this time, the vase was ground into a fine dust from the two opposing forces.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>With white dust covering his whole body, Xiao Yan quickly jumped out of the vase\u2019s \u201cexplosion\u201d ground zero. Watching the outcome of the vase, light shone in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. If he was able to master both of the skills and change them without pause then he could make unprepared people take a huge loss.</p><br/><p>Patting off the white dust, Xiao Yan knew that he had a new training task in the next three months.</p><br/><p>Three months later will be his Coming of Age Ceremony\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, a lot of people are probably hoping that I make a fool of myself at the Coming of Age Ceremony right?\u201d In the scattered room, a young and cold laugh sounded.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

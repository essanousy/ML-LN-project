What he was looking at was the last of the Foundation Elixir. At the final few stages of Duan Qi, it was becoming incredibly difficult to raise his Duan Qi. Xiao Yan\u2019s 7 Duan Qi hadn\u2019t been rising by much for the past three months and the feeling of breaking through to 8 Duan Qi never came to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Staring at the basin like a fool for a while, Xiao Yan finally pulled back his gaze while shaking his head: \u201cCan I use this last Foundation Elixir to get to 8 Duan Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Slowly straightening his numb body, Xiao Yan, surprisingly, didn\u2019t start training. Instead, he took out black clothes from his closet\u2026</p><br/><p>The month before the Coming of Age Ceremony, all of the participants in the ceremony had to attend a test. The test was to eliminate those whose Dou Qi wasn't\u00a0high enough. Those that had more than 7 Duan Qi were allowed a chance to go into the Dou Qi Hall to find a Qi Method after completing their Coming of Age Ceremony. On the other hand, those that were below 7 Duan Qi would lose that chance and be \u201cexiled\u201d to the clan\u2019s property after the ceremony. Unless they show exceptional talent or bravery, they would never get a chance to become part of the inner circle of the Xiao Clan\u2026</p><br/><p>Right after he put on his clothes, a light knock came from the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, are you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing a high girly voice, Xiao Yan\u2019s brows jumped while he quickly buttoned his clothes before hiding the wood basin in a overlooked corner. After checking that all was fine, he slowly waltzed to the door and opened the door.</p><br/><p>When the door opened, warm sunshine flew onto him and Xiao Yan with the black clothing seemed especially spirited.</p><br/><p>Outside of the door, a young girl wearing a light and refreshing green robe with a purple cloth belt was patiently waiting for Xiao Yan...</p><br/><p>Watching the girl outside of his door, Xiao Yan was shocked for quite a while before recovering and said: \u201cThis early, I thought it was a goddess that came down but taking a closer look, it was Xun Er!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Yan taunting praise, Xun Er\u2019s agile eyes blinked and her small mouth curved into a smile. However, from her brows that were almost in the shape of a crescent moon, one could tell the happiness she felt.</p><br/><p>With a hint of happiness in her eyes, Xun Er raised her delicate chin and started examining the young man in front of her.</p><br/><p>After a year\u2019s worth of training, Xiao Yan had grown out of his naivety and instead, on his delicate and well-figured face were a few hints of manly charm. After a long period of beat receiving training, his overall body tone was full of muscles and even though he was covered by a black shirt, his figure seemed rippling with energy.</p><br/><p>Walking out of the room and closing the door, Xiao Yan finally saw the dumbstruck Xun Er that wasn\u2019t even blinking as she stared at him. Confused, Xiao Yan took a look of himself and asked: \u201cIs there anything wrong with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her beautiful face blushing, Xun Er quickly moved her sight away and smiled: \u201cLet\u2019s go Xiao Yan ge-ge. Today\u2019s the pre-test for the Coming of Age Ceremony, are you ready?\u201d</p><br/><p>Narrowing his eyes, Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders while his lips went up with a stubborn pride. His hands slowly curled into fists as he said: \u201cThe title of cripple, I\u2019ll return it to those that gave it to me today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching the confident Xiao Yan, Xun Er also nodded her head: \u201cI believe in Xiao Yan ge-ge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course you believe in me; you\u2019ve probably determined what Duan Qi I'm at already.\u201d Xiao Yan gave her a white eye and helplessly said.</p><br/><p>Watching the depressed Xiao Yan, Xun Er slightly nodded her head but quickly responded: \u201cGetting to 7 Duan Qi from 3 Duan Qi in less than a year. Xiao Yan ge-ge\u2019s talent, even Xun Er\u2019s talent is far inferior to yours\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan touched his nose and affectionately tapped Xun Er\u2019s head. Then he quickly starting taking huge strides to the clan\u2019s training field.</p><br/><p>Watching the completely different backline of Xiao Yan, without the sadness and loneliness from the past, Xun er smiled and muttered: \u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, Xun Er knew that you would take back your respect and honor\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>On the green rocked training field, at least a hundred boys and girls were waiting there. Their chatter was like a low roar that spread quite far.</p><br/><p>At the middle of the training field was a huge black monument which was a testing monument that only clans with quite a bit of power could own because of its high price. Next to the black monument was the same impassive tester from 1 year ago.</p><br/><p>On an elevated platform to the left of the training field were the clan\u2019s more prominent members. At the middle of the platform was the clan leader, Xiao Zhan, surrounded by the three elders.</p><br/><p>Inside the field, the about to be tested examinees\u00a0were all standing. Those that performed quite highly before didn\u2019t show much stress on their faces while those that didn\u2019t have much talent had tense and scared faces.</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhan examined the people in the training field with a dark face and sighed inwardly. Yan Er, can you pass this test?</p><br/><p>\u201cClan leader, it\u2019s almost time! Why isn\u2019t Xiao Yan here yet?\u201d The second elder furrowed his brows and asked.</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhan gave him a sideways glance and said: \u201cIt\u2019s not time yet, why be in such a hurry? The second elder I know isn\u2019t such a hasty person.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the rebuttal from Xiao Zhan, the second elder\u2019s face was somewhat ugly when he coldly retorted: \u201cEven if you gave him that Foundation Elixir, he can\u2019t possibly get to 7 Duan Qi in one month! You should stop hoping for some miracle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Xiao Zhan\u2019s face flashed with anger. He was also worrying about that and the second elder hit his soft spot. But right when he was about respond to the second elder\u2019s barebone words, a slight disturbance occurred in examinees\u00a0in the training field.</p><br/><p>Looking towards the disturbance, Xiao Zhan saw two shadows slowly coming over from the end of the path leading to the training field. Their steps weren\u2019t hurried, as if they were unaffected by today\u2019s test.</p><br/><p>Narrowing his eyes to get a better sight of the black clothed young man\u2019s light smile, Xiao Zhan didn\u2019t know why but he felt much, much better all of a sudden\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

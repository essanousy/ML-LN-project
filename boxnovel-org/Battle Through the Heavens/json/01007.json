He exchanged glances with Jin Gu by the side. He hesitated for a moment before he slowly uttered, \u201cThe Heaven Blood Mountain Pool does indeed possess some miraculous effect of aiding one to breakthrough the bottleneck. However, the chances of this occurring are not very great. Moreover, it is only effective to some experts who have remained at the peak of the Dou Huang class for some time. However, looking at your strength, it is likely that it has only been a short period of time since you advanced to a nine star Dou Huang. Hence, even if you enter the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool, it would be quite difficult for you if you intend to rely on it to breakthrough to the Dou Zong class.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. He also felt some doubt within his heart. He valued this Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. Otherwise, he would not have taken the risk of being captured by the Wind Lightning Pavilion to head over to this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat method does elder Jin Shi have in mind?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s finger gently tapped on the rock table. He suppressed the earlier turbulence in his heart as he softly inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe mouth of the Heaven Eye Mountain peak volcano is the place with the densest energy within the Heaven Eye Mountain Range. The Heaven Mountain Blood Pool is also formed from this enormous amount of energy. However, this is not the most exquisite part of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool.\u201d Jin Shi\u2019s eyes were thrown toward the enormous volcano mouth as he said in a deep voice, \u201cAlthough most of the energy will agglomerate in the red-colored liquid in that enormous volcano mouth each time an energy tide is formed, a small portion of it will sink down and seep into the deepest portion of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. Although it contains only a small amount of energy, it is exceptionally pure, perhaps because it is formed over a long period of time\u2026 unfortunately, that place, which possesses a great treasure, is also where the fire poison is the densest.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bitterness in Jin Shi\u2019s face had become quite a lot denser when his words reached the end.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison within elder Jin Shi was obtained from that place?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s expression gradually changed as he asked.</p><br/><p>Jin Shi sighed and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven with elder Jin Shi\u2019s strength, you were unable to withstand the corrosion of the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison. Xiao Yan has only the strength of a nine star Dou Huang. How will I be able to endure it?\u201d Xiao Yan involuntarily frowned as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOther people will naturally not dare to enter the bottom of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. However, for you, who possesses a \u2018Heavenly Flame,\u2019 it will not be too difficult. Although the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison is like maggots in one\u2019s bones, it will still have no way of dealing with a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.\u201d Jin Shi smiled as he replied.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyebrows were involuntarily lifted when he heard this. Ever since he had entered the Heaven Eye Mountain, he had never revealed the \u2018Heavenly Flame.\u2019 How did this Jin Shi know that he possessed one?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe noses of our Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe are extremely sharp. We also have an ability that can sense the energy within one\u2019s body. It is not the first time that I have seen a \u2018Heavenly Flame,\u2019 and it is only natural that I am aware of the frightening scent of this thing.\u201d Jin Shi grinned as he replied, aware of the doubt in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan came to a sudden understanding as he said, \u201cDoes elder Jin intend on getting me to head to the bottom of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool and borrow the energy there to break through the Dou Huang class?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shi slightly tilted his head. He glanced at Xiao Yan and said, \u201cThat place is an area originally discovered by us, the Gold Swallowing Mouse. In order to open up that place, quite a number of Gold Swallowing Mice have ended up dying. Hence, that place can be considered a secret location to our Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe. Even Feng Qing Er and the others are not aware of it. What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan crossed his ten fingers. He mused for a moment. Only then did he raise his eyes and look at Jin Shi. He said, \u201cAlright, but I will only help elder expel the poison after I successfully come out from the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shi narrowed his eyes and slowly said, \u201cIt is not that I do not trust you. However, there is no evidence in a verbal agreement. I cannot just rely on a sentence of yours to confirm that you can really help me expel the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison from my body, can I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Heaven Eye Mountain, the territory of the Gold Swallowing Mice. With elders Jin Gu and Jin Shi present in this place, you will not need to worry about the little me fleeing, do you?\u201d Xiao Yan chuckled.</p><br/><p>Jin Shi turned his head slightly upon hearing this. He exchanged looks with Jin Gu. It was a long while later before he finally nodded. He faintly said, \u201cIn that case, I will trust you once. Hopefully, you will do as you promised. If you fail to meet the requirements of this transaction at that time, you should not blame the old me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a faint threat at the end of his words. However, Xiao Yan merely grinned. Although the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison in Jin Shi\u2019s body was serious, it was not completely impossible to expel it\u2026</p><br/><p>Jin Shi waved his hand when he saw that Xiao Yan did not object. A gold light flashed to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a spatial barrier that is placed by my Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe at the bottom of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. You must rely on this thing in order to enter it.\u201d Jin Shi said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan grabbed the object and glanced at it. It was a dark-golden-colored mouse skull. Xiao Yan nodded, stored it in his storage ring and laughed, \u201cIn that case, I will thank elder Jin Shi. If I am really able to breakthrough the Dou Huang class in this place, you can leave the treatment of the Heaven Mountain Fire Poison in your body to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the best\u2026 you should return first. The peak of the energy tide will be arriving soon. At that time, the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool will swiftly fill up. All you need to do is enter it at the most opportune time.\u201d Jin Shi said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also beamed when he heard this. He stood up and cupped his hands to the two before turning around, walking out of the rock pavilion. He headed toward the volcano\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Jin Shi involuntarily sighed when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s distant back. He said, \u201cThe bottom of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool is a place that our Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe had discovered with much difficulty. If that place did not possess fire poison, it would have allowed our Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe\u2019s strength to soar. Unfortunately, an outsider will be the first who will enjoy its benefits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStop nagging. Even with your strength, you have also been injured by the Blood Pool, leaving you like this. It is likely that the other tribe members will die on the spot if they head down. Although it is a treasure ground, it is also a fatal place.\u201d Jin Gu curled his mouth as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I ended up getting the fire poison all over my body, I advanced from a five star Dou Zong to a seven star Dou Zong within these short ten years. This speed is many times faster than in other places. I can be considered to have not lost out.\u201d Jin Shi smiled as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t meet Xiao Yan, it is likely that you would not have lived for three more years. Even if we are able to invite a tier 7 alchemist from the Central Plains over, it is likely that the price will be even higher than if we hire him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shi smiled. He also stood up and his gaze turned to the volcano\u2019s mouth. He said, \u201cOriginally, I was thinking of using the blood pool to groom the experts in my tribe. However, from the looks of it now, I will need to plan carefully\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shi sighed after saying those words. His sigh contained a little unwillingness. Guarding a treasure that they could not use. Such a feeling was the thing that really caused one to become miserable.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Eight figures were standing on a slope near the mouth of the volcano. An argument was occurring.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you should stop arguing. There are only eight spots, yet there are nine of us here. I say that we should just allocate the spots based on the level of our strength. The one who is weakest should voluntarily withdraw. What do you say?\u201d A white-clothed man, who had an evil appearance between his brow, swept his gaze over everyone before it finally landed on Nalan Yanran. He laughed.</p><br/><p>The expressions of the other people changed upon hearing his words. However, they did not open their mouths. Being the person in question, Nalan Yanran bunched up her eyebrows. Her hand rubbed the white fox in her embrace as she replied in a calm voice, \u201cIt is quite difficult for me to reach this place with my strength. However, since he has brought me here with much difficulty, it is naturally impossible for me to take the initiative to quit. Xiao Yan can get me to quit, but you cannot.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll you did is borrow the strength of others. What ability do you have? Being someone else\u2019s exclusive property and allowing others to play with you just for the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool is not worthwhile.\u201d The white-clothed man coldly laughed.</p><br/><p>Feng Qing Er, Mu Qing Luan, and the two others did not join the present argument. With their strength, no one would dare point their eyes toward them. Hence, their gazes were all thrown to the mouth of the volcano.</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran\u2019s pretty face turned frosty when she heard the mean words from the white-clothed man. Powerful Dou Qi swiftly surged out of her body. After which, fire seemed to rise from her pretty eyes as she stared at the former. Before she could attack, however, a hand gently landed on her shoulders. A laugh that caused her to relax was transmitted over.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that the discussion is not going smoothly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this voice, even Feng Qing Er and the three others swiftly turned their eyes over. They stared at Xiao Yan behind Nalan Yanran and their eyes contained unusual emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cAllow me.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled slightly to Nalan Yanran. After which, he slowly stepped forward, staring at the white-clothed man. An iciness was revealed in the smile on his face, \u201cDo you think that it is better for her to withdraw?\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression of the white-clothed man became somewhat ugly when he saw Xiao Yan appear. However, he could not back down in front of everyone\u2019s eyes. All he could do was toughen his skin and coldly laugh, \u201cOriginally, she would not have gotten here if she had relied on her own strength. Should she not give up this spot?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there anyone else who thinks this?\u201d Xiao Yan turned his head. His gaze slowly swept over everyone as he softly inquired.</p><br/><p>Feng Qing Er and the others did not say anything in the face of Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes, which revealed dangerous aura. The remaining two did not dare to clash with Xiao Yan. Hence, no one ended up speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are only eight spots, but there are nine of us here!\u201d The corner of the white-clothed man\u2019s mouth was pulled when he saw this before he finally cried out.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan tilted his head in agreement. He strode forward and the muffled sound of thunder appeared. An afterimage surfaced and his body emerged in front of the white-clothed man in a ghost-like manner.</p><br/><p>The white-clothed man had remained cautious while talking with Xiao Yan. Hence, his expression abruptly changed when the thunder sound appeared. His body swiftly withdrew, but he had just taken a step back when a figure followed close behind him like maggots in his bones. A thunder-like punch tore through the air and violently smashed into the chest of the white-clothed man.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug!\u201d</p><br/><p>A mouthful of crimson blood was spat out as the white-clothed man\u2019s body flew backwards. It immediately collided with an enormous rock, that shattered into pieces!</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, there are only eight people left\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s figure appeared. His looked at the collapsed man with indifferent eyes as he slowly spoke.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The bigger one was still alright, but the smaller one\u2019s face was filled with impatience.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has been in the hidden chamber for two days, why is he still not done?\u201d After sitting for a moment, Zi Yan leaped to her feet after failing to control herself.</p><br/><p>\u201cRefining pills exhausts a great amount of time. One cannot rush it.\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor placed down a slightly yellowish book in her hand. Her pretty eyes gently glanced at the secret chamber as she said, \u201cLet\u2019s wait a little longer. It should be soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have already said these words almost ten times.\u201d Zi Yan curled her lips as she muttered to herself. She could only return to her seat. However, the entire room suddenly and intensely shook just as she sat down.</p><br/><p>The sudden shaking caused the Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan to be startled. Their gazes turned to the secret chamber in unison. An unusually dense energy ripple was swiftly being formed in that direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like the pill refinement is about to succeed.\u201d Joy flashed through the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s pretty eyes when she sensed that rich energy ripple. Although she was not an alchemist, she could still be considered quite experienced after all these years. She naturally knew that some high tier medicinal pills would create quite the commotion when they took shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cPay more attention. Do not allow anyone to come here to disturb him. This Black Emperor Pavilion is very crowded with many experts. The activity here will not remain hidden from everyone.\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor spoke with a deep voice. However, her voice had just sounded when the energy ripple from the secret chamber suddenly soared to a frightening degree. One could immediately hear a \u2018bang\u2019 and half-a-foot-thick energy light pillar shot out of the secret chamber. Finally, it broke through the ceiling and charged to the sky.</p><br/><p>Even the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s expression involuntarily changed a little when she saw the light pillar that had broken through the ceiling and rushed to the sky. She immediately knit her brows and softly wondered aloud, \u201cWhat medicinal pill is Xiao Yan refining? The activity it created is very large. Looks like the entire Black Emperor Pavilion has been disturbed by this. Zi Yan, you should guard this place. Kill anyone who enters this room!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s tone was filled with a dense coldness by the end of her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Zi Yan nodded before she immediately spoke in a hurried manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI must reveal myself and deter those old demons who have ill intentions.\u201d A cold glint flashed across the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s grayish-purple eyes. This kind of commotion would definitely attract some elite Dou Zongs. If any old man interrupted in a random manner, it would likely result in Xiao Yan suffering quite a serious injury.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s body moved after her words sounded. She disappeared from the room in a strange manner and was already on the roof the next time she reappeared. Her cold eyes slowly swept around.</p><br/><p>It was just as the Little Fairy Doctor had anticipated. This pillar of light that had suddenly shot to the sky had almost instantly attracted the attention of all the experts within the Black Emperor Pavilion. The faces of quite a number of people were shocked as they sensed the pure energy contained in this pillar of light. They immediately rushed out of their rooms. Within less than a minute the treetop and roofs of the buildings around the pavilion that Xiao Yan\u2019s group resided in was filled with human figures.</p><br/><p>Some of the experts finally identified the origin of the light pillar following their observation from a close proximity. Numerous exclamations immediately sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe light pillar is filled with a pill fragrance. It looks like there is someone refining medicinal pills within the room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA high tier medicinal pill might be able to create some activity, but unless it is a tier 7 medicinal pill, there is seldom such an unusual phenomenon? Don\u2019t tell me that there is someone refining a tier 7 medicinal pill here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! The activity from the pill formation of a tier 7 medicinal pill is much bigger than this. It should be a rare high grade medicinal pill from among the tier 6 medicinal pills!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, a medicinal pill that is able to stir such an activity is definitely not an ordinary item. Hee hee, I wonder which alchemist grandmaster is below? Don\u2019t tell me it is Qi Shan from the Black Emperor Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, Qi Shan just advanced to a tier 6 alchemist not long ago. How is it possible for him to possess the ability to refine this kind of high grade tier 6 medicinal pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>Private conversations began to increase following a greater number of experts appearing around the building. The eyes of some of those people who had heard these words were gradually filled with an additional greed when they looked at the light pillar. A medicinal pill that could stir such a commotion was definitely not an ordinary item.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Waves of rushing wind sounds suddenly appeared. Immediately some human figures flashed over before remaining suspended in the sky. Their eyes revealed some surprise as they observed the light pillar that surged to the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is unexpected that there is such an alchemist grandmaster within the Black Emperor City. I wonder which great person he is.\u201d Over ten human figures stood in the air at a spot in the sky. Their leader, a white-haired old man with a Doupeng, spoke in a surprised voice.</p><br/><p>TL: Doupeng - a conical hat with a cloth hanging over it to cover one\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, looking at this activity, it is likely that the medicinal pill is almost in the 7th tier. Such a medicinal pill is something that even Qi Shan would be unable to refine.\u201d A man was flapping his Dou Qi wings beside the old man with an expression filled with solemness. This person\u2019s expression was somewhat familiar. If one were to look carefully, it was surprisingly Xiao Yan\u2019s second brother, Xiao Li. Who else could that white-haired old man beside him be other than the First Elder of the Inner Academy, Su Qian?</p><br/><p>Su Qian slightly nodded. His eyes looked all around him and solidified before speaking faintly, \u201cIt is unexpected that the people from the Demon Flame Valley have also arrived.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Li was also startled when he heard this. His gaze immediately followed Su Qian\u2019s eyes as he looked over. He saw a group of human figures suspended in the sky not far away. The leader was an old man who was clearly the First Elder from the Demon Flame Valley, Fang Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe actually ended up meeting this group of bastards in this place. Looks like we cannot allow them to leave smoothly after this matter is over.\u201d Xiao Li\u2019s eyes turned cold as he laughed after seeing the red-haired old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, huh?\u201d Su Qian nodded his head. His gaze swept over the other side in an indifferent manner. He involuntarily let out a surprised \u2018huh\u2019 when his eyes swept over the gray-robed person.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder, what is it?\u201d Xiao Li asked uncertainly.</p><br/><p>Su Qian knit his brows slightly only to shake his head a little. When his gaze once again swept over that gray-robed person, the latter gave him the faint feeling of danger for some unknown reason.</p><br/><p>During the time that Xiao Li\u2019s group discovered the people from the Demon Flame Valley, the latter\u2019s eyes had also looked over. Both parties\u2019 gazes crossed each other and the air was filled with a dense killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is unexpected that even the old fellow Su Qian is here. Looks like there might be some trouble killing them this time around.\u201d Fang Yan slowly withdrew his eyes and spoke with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the time comes, all we need to do is kill him together with the others.\u201d The sleeves of the gray-robed person shook as his indifferent voice drifted out. \u201cI am currently more curious about who the person refining the pill is. By being able to refine such a medicinal pill, it is likely that his alchemy skill is even greater than Qi Shan from the Black Emperor Sect. Since when did an alchemist of such a tier appear in this \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also not certain. This time around, the Black Emperor City has gathered experts from everywhere. I think that this person should be one of them.\u201d Fang Yan shook his head as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, however, this person actually dares to refine pills in such a place. I think that now should be the crucial moment before the pill is formed. If he is disturbed at this moment, the destruction of the pill is a small matter. He might even receive a backlash\u2026\u201d The gray-robed person spoke with a hoarse, cold laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what result does mister want? An alchemist of this tier should also have a strong soul.\u201d The corner of Fang Yan\u2019s mouth lifted as he asked.</p><br/><p>Fang Yan\u2019s words had just sounded when a snow-white figure slowly appeared on top of the building which the light pillar originated from.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyone who comes within a hundred meter radius will die!\u201d</p><br/><p>A pair of cold and indifferent grayish-purple eyes slowly swept around once the white figure appeared. Finally, her eyes paused in a couple of directions. A cold, dense cry immediately resounded across the sky.</p><br/><p>A majestic aura suddenly swept out from the graceful and moving person\u2019s lovely figure after her cry sounded. The faces of everyone present changed upon sensing the powerful degree of this aura. Involuntary cries repeatedly sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn elite Dou Zong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Quite a number of people felt a chill within their hearts as they sensed the dense cold killing intent that spread over after their voices sounded. They hurriedly withdrew.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis girl is actually an elite Dou Zong? How is it possible?\u201d Fang Yan could not help but feel somewhat stunned when he sensed that majestic aura. Since when did this \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 have such a young Dou Zong?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have ten breath\u2019s time to get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her chilly ice-like gaze suddenly shot toward Fang Yan while he was feeling shock in his heart. The indifferent killing intent contained within those eyes caused the heart of the First Elder from the Demon Flame Valley to feel a little chilled.</p><br/><p>Although his heart felt a chill, when had Fang Yan been yelled at by someone given his current position in the Black-Corner Region? Moreover, he had that gray-robed person following him. Hence, his heart was not filled with fear like an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s withdraw first. Now is not the right time to fight with her. It is not a wise action to randomly form a grudge with an elite Dou Zong.\u201d That gray-robed person slowly spoke just as Fang Yan felt slightly angry in his heart.</p><br/><p>Fang Yan was startled when he heard this. He could only nod his head, wave his hand, and force everyone to withdraw.</p><br/><p>The surrounding people could not help but smack their lips together when they saw the experts from the Demon Flame Valley forced back by this white-clothed lady with a cry. An elite Dou Zong was indeed not an ordinary person.</p><br/><p>Only Xiao Li\u2019s group of people from \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 were left in the sky after the people from the Demon Flame Valley withdrew. Hence, the eyes of the white-clothed lady, which were filled with a killing intent, slowly swept over.</p><br/><p>The expressions of Xiao Li\u2019s group changed when they sensed that indifferent gaze. He exchanged glances with Su Qian and was just about to automatically withdraw when the cold and indifferent eyes of the white-clothed lady became slightly surprised. A somewhat uncertain voice was slowly emitted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are people from \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

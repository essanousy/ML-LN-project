Countless words were layered on it in an orderly manner. Beside the words, there was an extremely complicated diagram of the human figure made of light. Within the diagram of light, numerous complicated lines formed by light intertwined with one another, forming a mysterious and strange route.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes carried some curiosity as they carefully inspected the screen of light. He immediately turned his head and saw Yao Lao\u2019s eyes, which shone brightly. He heart involuntarily leaped as he softly asked, \u201cTeacher, do you know what this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The glow in Yao Lao\u2019s eyes slowly withdrew as he smiled and nodded. He smacked his lips and smiled as he said with a surprised sigh, \u201cThis time around, you have indeed picked up a treasure. This \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019 is a very mysterious, high-class Secret Technique.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecret Technique?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyebrows immediately rose upon hearing these words.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, other than Qi Methods and Dou Techniques there are still some special Secret Techniques which exist on the Dou Qi continent. Their effects are usually something that will cause others to be envious. Some of them can even greatly raise one\u2019s strength. That night back at Wu Tan City, your little female friend used an advanced Secret Technique to enable herself to raise her strength to the Da Dou Shi class for a short period of time.\u201d Yao Lao smiled as he explained.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. The scene of that night when Xun Er stealthily entered the Jia Li clan to murder Liu Xi surfaced in his mind. She, whose strength had been at the Dou Zhe level, had suddenly raised her strength to a level where it was sufficient to contend with a Da Dou Shi. That kind of Secret Technique was really so strong that it was a little terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to what I know, this \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019 is one of the hidden treasures belonging to the \u2018Burning Flame Valley\u2019. Although it is a useless kind of Secret Technique for most people, it is undoubtedly a treasure which money cannot buy for a person who possesses a certain extraordinary and unique flame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s heart was moved as he heard this. Possessing a certain extraordinary type of flame? Was there any flame that was more extraordinary than a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 in this world?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf one wants to practice this kind of Secret Technique, the first requirement is that the practitioner must have the fire affinity. The second is that he must possess an extraordinary flame. The extraordinary flame here also includes those flames like your Purple Flame. Of course, the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is naturally the best choice. Ke ke. But since when was a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 so easy to find in this world? Therefore, I seem to have heard that only the Valley Leader of the \u2018Burning Flame Valley\u2019 possessed a kind of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.\u201d Yao Lao smiled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I were to fulfill these conditions and practice the \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019, can I also raise my strength for a short period of time?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyeballs rotated as he hurriedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cNaturally.\u201d Yao Lao fondled his beard and smiled. He eyed Xiao Yan\u2019s face which was filled with excitement as he said, \u201cThis so called \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019 actually relies on a special and bizarre method to draw out the special flame from within the body, and unleashes an extremely great energy, which is then used to push the opponent back and deter them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it as strong as the Secret Technique that Xun Er displayed back then?\u201d Xiao Yan suddenly interrupted and asked.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao frowned slightly upon hearing this. He mused for a moment before shaking his head immediately and said, \u201cBack then, I observed the complexion of that little girl and seeing that it was still rosy the next day after using the Secret Technique the night before, really surprised me. From the looks of it, I\u2019m afraid that there is still a gap between the Secret Technique she displayed and this one. After all, all Secret Techniques use a kind of compression or overdraw method to obtain strength. This lets a person\u2019s strength soar for a short period of time, but there would usually be a substantial backlash that appears after each use. Using this \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019 as an example example. It is said that each time it is used, the wild energy of the flame will cause people\u2019s body to be badly injured. However, from the external appearance of your little female friend the next day, she did not suffer from an overly large loss. From this, the differences of the two kinds of Secret Techniques can be determined.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed bitterly and sighed while shaking his head. In his heart, he felt increasingly strong curiosity of Xun Er\u2019s mysterious background. Given her age, she actually possessed a kind of Secret Technique that even Yao Lao could not stop praising. Just how strong was the faction that supported her?</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, you should not be so dejected. This \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019 is actually not weak either. According to what I know, if one possess three kinds of flame, this Secret Technique can let a person\u2019s strength to increase three different times. The scale at which your strength would increase is related to the strength of the flame that you control. Back then, the Valley Leader of the \u2018Burning Flame Valley\u2019 had one kind of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 and two \u2018Beast Flames\u2019, which were obtained from the bodies of two Magical Beasts. His original strength was around the five star Dou Zong level, but if he used the three transformations of the \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019, he could easily contend with a Dou Zhun!\u201d Yao Lao smiled and comforted Xiao Yan after seeing his expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? It actually allows the user to fight across classes?\u201d Xiao Yan was a little moved upon hearing this. After seeing Hai Bodong pushed back by a single attack of the Yun Shan\u2019s clones, he clearly knew just how difficult it was to cross the gap between each class once one reached the Dou Huang level. Yet this \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019 actually lets the user fight across the gaps between classes. From what you just said, it can indeed be considered \u2018a good thing\u2019 as Yao Lao had just said.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, that is the limit that one could raise if they only possess one \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. But it is different for you. The you who possesses the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 does not need to worry about the flames in your body clashing with one another. Therefore, as long as you are given enough time and luck to gather three kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019, the extent that your strength will rise when you activate the \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019 to the third transformation would likely be something that even the ancestor who had created this Secret Technique did not ever imagine. After all, he couldn\u2019t have also practiced the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019.\u201d Yao Lao laughed softly.</p><br/><p>The blood in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart could not help but boil a little when he heard Yao Lao\u2019s words. A flush surfaced on his face. His gaze was a little more fiery when he once again looked at the curtain of light.</p><br/><p>\u201cInsert your hand into that light green-colored liquid. In this way, you can completely obtain the training method for the \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019. You will not gain anything by looking at this light screen.\u201d Yao Lao reminded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan hurriedly nodded his head. He placed his finger into the liquid which was somewhat warm. The curtain of light that was suspended in midair trembled slightly. Immediately, it appeared to come to life as it swiftly began to move. A moment later, the screen of light turned into a string of light that poured directly into Xiao Yan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The enormous flood of information violently charged into his mind. Xiao Yan\u2019s face swiftly twitched a couple of times. He forcefully endured the wave of pain that swept over him as he hurriedly sat down, closed his eyes, and digested the information which contained the practice method of the Secret Technique.</p><br/><p>The mountain cave once again descended into complete silence. Yao Lao slowly stroked his beard as he eyed Xiao Yan who was seated with his eyes close. Suddenly, he let out a soft gloating laughter, \u201cIt is really unexpected that this heavily guarded Secret Technique of the \u2018Burning Flame Valley\u2019 would actually find it\u2019s way into the Jia Ma Empire. Moreover, it was even obtained by this little fellow. Hee hee. That antiquated old fellow Yan Huo wasn\u2019t even willing to let the old me borrow and read it back then. Yet it still landed in my disciple\u2019s hand. It was even obtained without any effort. If he were to know about this, I\u2019m afraid that he would be extremely furious. Ha ha.\u201d</p><br/><p>The laugh reverberated throughout the cave. It was a long while later before it slowly faded away. Xiao Yan, who had his eyes tightly closed also gradually opened them. He gently exhaled a breath of air while his eyes flashed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe training method for the \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019 is really strange. I don\u2019t know which odd genius could actually create this.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head and sighed. While he was digesting the information that had flown through his head earlier, he had roughly took a look at the training method for the \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019. It could indeed be called incomparably strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecret Techniques are extremely rare in this world. The extent of their rarity can even be comparable to a high Di class Qi Method.\u201d Yao Lao smiled and nodded. He asked, \u201cHow is it? Are you satisfied?\u201d</p><br/><p>TL: Note that Qi Method &gt; Dou Technique in terms of worth</p><br/><p>\u201cExtremely satisfied.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth parted with a smile. Quickly following it, however, he frowned and said, \u201cBut I have gave it a brief glance just now. This \u2018Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2019 does indeed have three transformations. Unfortunately, the information contained within the jade piece merely records the first transformation. There is not even the slightest prospect of the remaining two kinds of transformation.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? There is only one change?\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s eyebrows knit together when he heard this information. A long while later, he could only shake his head helplessly and said, \u201cThis is perhaps some small trick of the \u2018Burning Flame Valley\u2019. In this way, even if someone were to luckily obtain the Secret Technique, it would be difficult for them to practice all of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut if there isn\u2019t, then there isn\u2019t. The current me coincidentally only has one \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 within my body. It is perfect to train one kind of transformation for now.\u201d Xiao Yan waved his hand and said in an open-minded manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, then you should temporarily practice it first. Once you have found other \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 in the future, then we\u2019ll think of ways to obtain the remaining portion of the technique from the \u2018Burning Flame Valley\u2019.\u201d Yao Lao nodded his head and spoke softly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan quietly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have completely recovered from your injuries. What are you planning to do next?\u201d Yao Lao suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled upon hearing this. He mused for a moment, clenched his fists tightly, and said, \u201cI want to search for my father! Seeing that Yun Leng actually insisted that he had never touched my father just before his death, I\u2019m afraid that what he said should be the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s brows knit together as he spoke this point. He smiled bitterly and said, \u201cIf what he said were true, how could my father, with the strength of a Da Dou Shi, disappear in front of the eyes of a Dou Wang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao flicked his finger gently. A long while later, he narrowed his eyes slightly and spoke softly, \u201cYour father\u2019s strength is really that of a Da Dou Shi. Therefore, it is likely that he did not rely on his own strength to disappear into nowhere. It might be that there was someone else who did something to bring him away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone else?\u201d Xiao Yan was momentarily stunned. His expression changed slightly as he said: \u201cIf it really was someone else who did it, I\u2019m afraid that the other party\u2019s strength would at least be at the Dou Huang level in order to bring my father away in front of Yun Leng without the latter even realizing it. But other than me, it seems that my Xiao clan has never befriended such a strong person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the background of your Xiao clan, it is indeed really difficult for them to befriend such a strong person. But the faction behind your little female friend does have this ability.\u201d Yao Lao said blandly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, what do you mean? Someone Xun Er sent?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s face was at a loss as he asked after hearing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat little girl may be very smart, but she is far too young. It is unlikely that she possesses such great foresight. What I meant is that this may be related to the faction that stands behind her.\u201d Yao Lao shook his head and said, \u201cYour Xiao clan does have some connection with them, but it cannot be considered to be a good one. The relationship is overly complicated with too much implication. As an outsider, I am also not very certain about the details. The next time you meet that little female friend of yours, you can ask her and you may learn some secrets.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan found it difficult to ask more questions when he saw Yao Lao\u2019s expression. He nodded slightly and said in a soft voice, \u201cAlright. In any case, the clan has already been moved. I can also leave with my peace of mind. This time, let\u2019s hurry directly to Jia Nan Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan turned his body around and slowly walked towards the entrance of the cave. He eyed the dark, black night sky and a cold glint flashed across his narrowed pupils. He said faintly, \u201cHowever, a hard fight is unavoidable if we want to successfully leave the Jia Ma Empire. Given Yun Shan\u2019s character, he will definitely not allow me leave the Jia Ma Empire easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, since they want to get me to stay behind, then they should be prepared to receive a beating. I, Xiao Yan, am not someone who is softhearted!\u201d A green-colored flame abruptly leapt from his long finger. He slowly exhaled a breath of air. A thick, low voice slowly resounded within the interior of the cave.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

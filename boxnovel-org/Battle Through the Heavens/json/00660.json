That familiar face carried a little nostalgia. It was surprisingly Yao Lao who had been in a slumber within the ring for two years!</p><br/><p>At this moment, the body which Yao Lao had agglomerated was clearly more substantial than before. From the powerful Spiritual Strength which was faintly emitted from within his body, one could tell that his slumber these past two years had also caused Yao Lao\u2019s strength to increase significantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d Medusa was startled when her gaze swept over Yao Lao\u2019s face. She immediately pressed her eyebrows together and inquired in surprise.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao laughed. He raised his head and eyed Xiao Yan who had fallen unconscious. A pleased look was on his face. Although he had descended into a slumber, he was still able to sense an energy moisturizing his spirit in his unconsciousness. Who else other than Xiao Yan would use this kind of action to swiftly aid him in his recovery?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really unexpected that you have successfully swallowed the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 and merge with its spirit. Your progress is very quick. From the looks of it, I have been in a slumber for quite some time right?\u201d Yao Lao glanced at Medusa who was suspended in the sky without relying on any external strength as he laughed faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are not bad either. Your strength has actually soared to such an extent after sleeping for two years.\u201d Medusa coldly laughed. She glanced at him. Originally, she had thought that she would definitely be able to surpass this mysterious old man once she was able to merge with the spirit of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019. However, she did not expect Yao Lao\u2019s Spiritual Strength to become increasingly stronger after being in a slumber for two years. During that single lightning-like confrontation earlier, Medusa was able to sense that despite having successfully merged with the spirit of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 it was still quite difficult for her to defeat Yao Lao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you still remaining beside Xiao Yan now that you have already merged with the spirit of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019?\u201d A flicker flashed across Yao Lao lowered eyes. He was extremely clear of the enmity that Medusa held toward Xiao Yan. She was still afraid of him when he was around, and she had to be a little cautious even if she wanted to act. However, given Xiao Yan\u2019s strength, it was difficult to guarantee that this vicious woman would not have any other thoughts given Xiao Yan\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p>Medusa also understood the cold reprieve within Yao Lao\u2019s words. She was a haughty person and might listen a little if one spoke nicely to her. However, once one\u2019s tone was not to her liking, she would give the other party a cold face regardless of who he or she was. Hence, she also lifted her bewitchingly beautiful face and coldly replied when she heard these words of Yao Lao, \u201cWhat has it got to do with you that I am staying here? Old fellow, you also have some responsibility for the way that Xiao Yan humiliated me in that manner back then. I did not even find trouble with you now that we meet. Yet, you actually want to manage me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, what a razor-tongued girl. When the old me was roaming and dominating the continent, you were just drinking milk in some unknown place.\u201d Yao Lao gave a strange laugh. However, the coldness on his face had slowly reduced. Regardless of whether this woman had a killing intent toward Xiao Yan, the latter was at the very least still alive at the moment he met him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, the old me does not have the time to argue with you now. We can settle our score once I wake this little fellow.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s gaze looked in all directions before his gaze suddenly paused on a crimson medicinal cauldron on a huge rock between the cliff wall. He could not help but let out a surprised \u2018huh\u2019. He beckoned with his hand. A suction force appeared out of nowhere as that enormous medicinal cauldron automatically flew up and was suspended in front of Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis medicinal cauldron\u2026\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s hand gently rubbed against the numerous carvings of life-like beasts roaring with lifted heads on the medicinal cauldron. The surprise on his face was even richer a moment later. He could not resist speaking softly, \u201cThis medicinal cauldron\u2026 why does it look so similar to the \u2018Ten Thousand Beast Cauldron\u2019 recorded on the \u2018Heavenly Cauldron Ranking\u2019?</p><br/><p>Yao Lao clearly had an eye that was many times sharper than Xiao Yan when it came to knowledge of medicinal cauldrons. The latter could only sense that the medicinal cauldron was extraordinary, but had great difficulty guessing its origin. Yao Lao, on the other hand, was able to rely on a rough observation to make an educated guess. He was indeed formidable.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao rotated his eyes. They finally landed on Medusa beside him. He sighed in relief only after seeing that she actually had no reaction to this cauldron. He looked at that deep-blue storage ring from Xiao Yan\u2019s finger and was about to store the medicinal cauldron when he once again let out a surprised gasp, \u201cThere is actually a Spiritual Imprint? This is a high-grade storage ring? Hei, looks like this fellow\u2019s life has been quite good these two years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao was stunned for a moment after he was stopped by the faint resistance that was emitted from the storage ring when he was about to store the medicinal cauldron into the storage ring. A moment later, he finally smacked his mouth and praised this deep-blue storage ring.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao did not use force after the failure to store the cauldron. He waved his hand and an invisible strength dragged the cauldron such that it was suspended beside him. His gaze swept in all directions before his body moved and immediately rushed toward a mountain top.</p><br/><p>Medusa knit her eyebrows when she saw Yao Lao bringing Xiao Yan away. She hesitated for a moment before moving her body and swiftly following along.</p><br/><p>Medusa\u2019s act of following them naturally did not escape Yao Lao\u2019s notice. The latter frowned slightly, but did not stop her. The most important thing now was to wake this little fellow up. Hence, his body shook and his somewhat illusionary body quietly glided across the sky before stopping on a mountain peak that was covered by huge, lush, green trees.</p><br/><p>The moon was like a silver plate that hung in the distant sky. The cool moonlight scattered down, covering the entire mountain range with a faint layer of silver yarn. This layer was unusually beautiful under the dark sky, appearing exceptionally obscure and mysterious.</p><br/><p>There was a faint bonfire that was rising within the lush, green forest. The red-colored fire light was extremely eye-catching in the deep dark woods.</p><br/><p>The old man beside the bonfire with an aged face touched the forehead of the black-robed, young man. Powerful Spiritual Strength surged out and invaded the latter\u2019s exhausted spirit. A cool faced bewitching beauty stood prettily not far from the bonfire. Her long eyes carried an unknown emotion as she looked indifferently at the young and old.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao slowly exhaled a long time later. His hand also left Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead as his finger shook. A bottle of medicinal pills surfaced. After which, he forcefully stuffed them into Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have not seen him for two years. It is really unexpected that this little fellow\u2019s Spiritual Strength has already become this strong. It is really formidable. However, I wonder exactly what level his strength has reached?\u201d Yao Lao exclaimed and shook his head. He watched Xiao Yan\u2019s throat roll as the young man swallow the medicinal pills. The latter\u2019s eyes were still tightly shut.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s breath was currently in his most weary state, and the Dou Qi within his body was almost completely exhausted. Hence, even with Yao Lao\u2019s sharp senses, he was unclear of Xiao Yan\u2019s exact ability.</p><br/><p>While Yao Lao was muttering, Xiao Yan, who was in an unconscious state, suddenly emitted an intense cough. His eyelashes immediately trembled. A moment later, his tightly shut eyes slowly opened.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze was once again clear. The first thing that was imprinted into his eyes was the extremely familiar old smiling face in front of him that caused Xiao Yan to be completely at ease.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan raised his head a moment after he saw that familiar kind old face. He looked at the sky and let out a long breath. After releasing a long breath, it seemed as though all his worries and the pressure he faced were completely removed as he leaned his weak body on the tree trunk behind him. He smiled and said to Yao Lao, \u201cTeacher, I haven\u2019t seen you for two years. Are you well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s gaze stared intently at the cold, stern, young face that had gained an additional maturity compared to two years ago. He knew that during this long period of time in which he was in slumber, this little fellow who had been relying on him before had completely transformed into someone with the qualification and strength to be independent.</p><br/><p>The baby eagle which required his constant protection back then was currently able to flap his wings and fly up high, soaring across the sky!</p><br/><p>From a certain point of view, the current Xiao Yan already possessed the qualification to leave his teacher.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s warm shriveled hand gently patted Xiao Yan\u2019s head. He spoke with a pleased smile, \u201cLittle fellow, you have done well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan merely rubbed his head awkwardly in the face of Yao Lao\u2019s praise. He struggled to sit up, but the waves of weariness that were emitted from his body caused him to helplessly shake his head. He lifted his eyes and suddenly glanced at Medusa a short distance away. He immediately smiled and said, \u201cThank you for rescuing me Cai Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan had fallen unconscious when he had fallen from the large rock, he was still able to vaguely sense that Queen Medusa had come to his rescue.</p><br/><p>Medusa did not show any reaction to Xiao Yan\u2019s thanks. She merely responded in a faint voice, \u201cI did not rescue you. It is he who has saved you. Moreover, I am only thinking of obtaining the medicinal pill which you have promised to refine for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan clearly understood the tough character of Queen Medusa, and was too lazy to dispute with her. He turned his head to Yao Lao by the side and asked with a smile, \u201cTeacher, your strength has improved?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt cannot be considered an improvement. I have merely recovered a little of my strength back then. It is likely that I must first settle the problem of my body if I want to completely recover.\u201d Yao Lao shook his head and immediately asked somewhat anxiously, \u201cLittle fellow, what about that \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been refined by me.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and spoke without care.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just knew that you would not disappoint anyone.\u201d Joy that was difficult to hide immediately surged onto Yao Lao\u2019s face when he heard these words. His hand heavily patted Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders. Although Yao Lao had guessed a little when he saw that Xiao Yan was still alive after he had awakened, Yao Lao could not help but rejoice despite his control once his guess had been verified.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled when he saw Yao Lao\u2019s joyous face. He hesitated for a moment before suddenly speaking in a soft voice, \u201cMoreover, teacher\u2026 this disciple has also finished off that person who betrayed his teacher\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The soft voice immediately stunned Yao Lao. It was a long time latter before Yao Lao exhaled with all his strength. One could not tell whether his expression was one of grief or relief. His hand slowly but heavily patted Xiao Yan. A low, solemn, old voice that caused one\u2019s heart to ache resounded by Xiao Yan\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much, little fellow!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

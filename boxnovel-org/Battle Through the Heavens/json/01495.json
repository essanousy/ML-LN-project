His eyes were filled with a grave expression. He did not expect his roaming soul to lead him to meet that elusive hall chief of the Hall of Souls. If that mysterious expert did not help, it would have been a little difficult for Xiao Yan to escape. Although Xiao Yan was not inferior to that chief of the Hall of Souls in terms of a spiritual collision, the chief was right in saying that there was too much of a gap between Xiao Yan\u2019s and his actual strength\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe chief of the Hall of Souls is likely even greater than Zi Yan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly exhaled. He suppressed his rapidly beating heart. The matter from earlier was far too dangerous. That person was indeed worthy of being the chief of the Hall of Souls. Just his soul alone could cause Xiao Yan to feel helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, I wonder just who that mysterious expert is? I don\u2019t think I am acquainted with such a strong person. Why has he aided me?\u201d Xiao Yan knit his brow. He finally managed gain an idea of just how many hidden experts there were within the Central Plains after this spiritual tour. He had nearly met with mishap even with his Perfect Heavenly State soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that mysterious expert was willing to lend me a hand, he is likely a friend rather than an enemy. If I can discover his identity, he might be a great help.\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes flickered. That mysterious expert from earlier was clearly unafraid of the chief of the Hall of Souls. He did not even end up in a disadvantage when they clashed. Xiao Yan was even able to detect some fear in the hall chief\u2019s cry!</p><br/><p>There were not many people within this continent who could frighten an expert like the Hall of Souls\u2019 chief\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan frowned and mused for a moment, but it was to no avail. He could only shake his head. He lifted his head and looked to the north-west. An extremely hot flame danced within those black eyes of his. He had managed to gain a lot from this spiritual tour. Not only did he meet the chief of the Hall of Souls, he had also discovered the location where the demonic flame would appear. That distorted space sealed the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame inside.</p><br/><p>However, from the way the chief of the Hall of Souls and that mysterious experts had appeared in that area, it was obvious that these peak experts had already detected it. Hence, they had been standing guard. Meeting with the Hall of Souls\u2019 chief this time around seemed as though Xiao Yan was delivering himself to be captured.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the looks of the damaged appearance of that space, it is obvious that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is planning to break free. Perhaps, it will descend on this world in the next few days\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan gently rubbed his hands together. This collision with the chief of the Hall of Souls had allowed Xiao Yan to understand his strength. The current Xiao Yan would not have a chance of victory if he met with him. Hence, Xiao Yan needed to obtain the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame at all cost!</p><br/><p>With Xiao Yan\u2019s current strength, his strength would only soar quickly if he swallowed the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. At that moment, he would not even need to fear the chief of the Hall of Souls!</p><br/><p>Though, behind the chief of the Hall of Souls was the even more terrifying Hun clan. How could Xiao Yan clash with the Hun clan if he could not even deal with the people from the Hall of Souls? It should be known that this frightening faction had even killed his ancestor Xiao Xuan\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI must definitely obtain the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan clenched his fist. His hand suddenly touched his forehead. That mysterious cluster of light in his head, which had been obtained from the ancient map, had once again become calm after his soul returned to his body. Even with Xiao Yan\u2019s Perfect Heavenly State Spiritual Strength, he was unable to enter that light cluster.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing seems to have reacted to the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. It is likely something that the legendary Purifying Demon Lotus Saint left behind back then. I wonder what it is used for\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly frowned. He had spent a lot of effort to gather all of the map fragments only to obtain a secret that many had already known. If this light cluster had no other use, Xiao Yan would feel the impulse to drag the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint out to curse at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s fingers helplessly rubbed his head. He returned these thoughts to his heart and stood up. A thought passed through his mind and the Spiritual Strength in his brow surged out. It agglomerated into a life-like human figure.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan looked at the spiritual figure in front of him, who shared the same appearance as him. \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019s\u2019 face was also filled with life. It did not appear dull or sluggish. Both of them looked just like twins from a distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled toward \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019 in front of him as he extended his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease take good care of me.\u201d The \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019 formed by Xiao Yan\u2019s soul also smiled. He extended his hand and took Xiao Yan\u2019s hand. This scene appeared extremely comical and a little strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, there are actually two Xiao Yans\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A slight fluctuation appeared in the sky as a group of people appeared. They looked at the two figures grasping hands and were startled. Zi Yan let out an exclamation. She hurried down with a curious face and grabbed the two of them for a closer inspection.</p><br/><p>\u201cA spiritual avatar that looks exactly like one\u2019s actual body. The Perfect Heavenly State does live up to its reputation\u2026\u201d The First Elder from the Small Pill Tower slowly landed. He looked at Xiao Yan\u2019s avatar, which was filled with life, as he involuntarily praised.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, its strength is not any weaker than the original body. Any cooperation between the two can also be described as perfect. The two complement each other and possess a relatively frightening strength.\u201d Yao Lao fondled his beard as he spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan grinned. He waved his hand and the spiritual avatar in front of him disappeared. It turned into Spiritual Strength that rushed into Xiao Yan\u2019s brow.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, you have finally completed your training. Based on the time, the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame will appear in the world soon. We are still not certain where it will appear. However, when the time comes, it will definitely be an earth-shaking event\u2026\u201d Feng zun-zhe laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am already aware of the location where the demonic flame will appear.\u201d Xiao Yan slightly grinned. He hesitated for a moment after seeing Feng zun-zhe stunned face. Finally he said, \u201cI discovered it when my soul was roaming around earlier. Additionally, I made contact with the chief of the Hall of Souls\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of everyone present changed slightly upon hearing this information. Many pairs of eyes gathered on Xiao Yan. The chief of the Hall of Souls was an extremely powerful existence and the most mysterious person within the Hall of Souls. His strength could split the sky and cut through the earth. He was outrageously strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Yao Lao asked with a grave expression.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan spread his hands and roughly explained the incident earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like the Hall of Souls is indeed targeting the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. They are already standing guard\u2026\u201d Yao Lao slightly frowned. He mused for a moment before speaking, \u201cI am unable to guess the identity of that mysterious expert. However, he is likely a friend since he has helped you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need not pay much attention to the matter regarding the chief of the Hall of Souls. The appearance of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame will be an earth-shaking great event. At that time, those ancient clans will definitely intervene. The Gu clan will not be an exception. There will naturally be other experts dealing with the chief of the Hall of Souls at that time. All we need to do is wait for an opportunity to subdue the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.\u201d Yao Lao clenched his hand. A jade bottle appeared in it. A pill cloud lingered within the jade bottle and a dark-red medicinal pill quietly floated on it. Waves of an unusually icy-cold aura were slowly emitted from within the jade bottle, causing some flakes of ice to fall from the sky within a hundred feet of this bottle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Nine Yin Yellow Spring Pill. During your two months of training, both First Elder and I joined hands to successfully refine it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan received the jade bottle and a chill rose from his feet to his heart. He exhaled a long breath. His breath had just left him when it turned into an icy pillar that fell with a cracking sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed the Nine Yin Yellow Spring Pill. I have troubled teacher and First Elder.\u201d Xiao Yan felt some joy as he immediately thanked those two. The Nine Yin Yellow Spring Pill was a tier 9 treasure pill. It was likely that it was not easy to refine even with both the First Elder and Yao Lao working together.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao smiled and quickly said, \u201cNow that everything is ready, all we need to do is to wait for the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame to be born\u2026 whether we will be able to obtain it will depend on fate. After all, this Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame has not been subdued by anyone even when it appeared in this world in the past\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan quietly nodded. He was aware of how difficult it was to subdue the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Regardless of what the case was, he needed to do his best!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan, who had successfully trained his soul to the Perfect Heavenly State, gradually became free during the subsequent days. Spies from the alliances had also been dispatched. They reached the location Xiao Yan\u2019s soul had found and began an investigation.</p><br/><p>Of course, the \u2018Sky Mansion Alliance\u2019 was not the only one taking such actions. Those ancient sects and factions across the Central Plains, who usually did not reveal themselves, had all placed their focus on that area\u2026</p><br/><p>The appearance of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame had stirred most of the open or secretive factions who had the ability to snatch it!</p><br/><p>That mountain forest, which was usually deserted, had become extremely lively.</p><br/><p>These hidden operations continued for another four days\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan, who was seated on a towering tree in the Falling Star Pavilion, suddenly opened his eyes. He lifted his head and looked into the distant sky. Two moons, one above and one below, had suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>At the same time, nine bright stars in the sky slowly shifted in front of numerous pairs of stunned eyes. Finally, they formed a straight line\u2026</p><br/><p>Two moons simultaneously appearing, nine stars aligning, a world tide rising, the demonic flame descending!</p><br/><p>The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame had finally descended the world at this moment!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After which, she asked with some uncertainty.</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen smiled at Tang Huo Er\u2019s uncertainty. He glanced at Xiao Yan, who had sunk deep into the inheritance world of the crystal ball. After which, he placed both of his hands behind him and looked to the ceiling of the hall. A respectful expression was revealed in his eyes. \u201cBurning Flame Ancestor is the founder of our Burning Flame Valley. However, due to the great amount of time that has passed, many people have forgotten about this peak expert who once shook the entire continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Huo Er involuntarily clicked her tongue when she heard this. It was also the first time that she had heard of this so-called Burning Flame Ancestor. It seemed that the gap in time was indeed a large one.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the Burning Flame Ancestor very strong?\u201d Tang Huo Er asked somewhat curiously. She seemed to be extremely interested in this legendary figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s more than strong\u2026 according to what I know, there are five ultimate experts in the Dou Qi continent during that era. These five people represented the peak strength of the Dou Qi continent. The Burning Flame Ancestor was one of them. The five of them possessed mysterious and great power. It is rumored that they were just one step away from the legendary Dou Di class\u2026\u201d Tang Zhen slowly said. His voice contained an admiration for the experts during that era.</p><br/><p>\u201cDou Di\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A shocked expression appeared on Tang Huo Er\u2019s pretty face. This title did not require any decoration. It alone possessed an endless amount of pressure, causing everyone to turn into tiny ants in the face of this term.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are the four remaining ultimate experts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen revealed a pondering expression. A long while later, he finally replied, \u201cDue to it being a long time ago, I am unable to clearly remember the exact names of the four others. However, I am aware that the three among them belongs to three other great factions: the Gu clan, Hall of Souls, and Pill Tower\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of them are currently the true peak level factions\u2026\u201d Tang Huo Er\u2019s face was surprised. Immediately, she asked in a strange manner, \u201cWhat about the other person? Which faction is he from? Could it be the Flower Sect or the Profound Sky Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen slowly shook his head. There was also some uncertainty between his brows as he replied, \u201cThis person does not seem to belong to any top factions in the Central Plains today. However, I still have a clear memory of his name because, according to the records in the ancestral books, this expert and the Burning Flame Ancestor had quite a good relationship. It is rumored that this Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2026 had been created by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Skyfire Three Mysterious Change was created by that expert?\u201d Tang Huo Er\u2019s small mouth immediately widened in shock when she heard this. Her face was filled with surprise. Clearly, she seemed to be in a state of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ancestral books record it like this. Due to it being too long ago, it is difficult to determine if it is true or false\u2026\u201d Tang Zhen nodded as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the name of this mysterious and ultimate expert?\u201d Tang Huo Er became more curious as she hurriedly asked.</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen fondled his beard. He thought for a moment before he said somewhat uncertainly, \u201cHe seems\u2026 to be called Xiao\u2026 Xiao Xuan? Ugh, it has been many years since I read those ancestral books. I cannot remember his name too clearly. During that era, the Burning Flame Valley was not weaker than those peak factions like the \u2018Hall of Souls.\u2019 Unfortunately, no one like the ancestor has appeared in the Burning Flame Valley after that. Hence, its reputation has become far inferior to those factions like the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019...\u201d Tang Zhen sighed when he finished speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xuan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Huo Er muttered the words in her mouth. Suddenly, she quietly glanced at Xiao Yan, who had his eyes shut by the side. She smiled and said, \u201cXiao Yan\u2019s surname is also Xiao. Could he be related to this elder Xiao Xuan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen was startled when he heard this. He immediately burst out laughing, \u201cThere are as many people in this world who have the surname Xiao as there are hairs on a cow. Based on what you say, would it not mean that all these people are related to this elder Xiao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Huo Er stuck out her tongue. She had only randomly spoke. Naturally, she would not be so serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, aren\u2019t you overestimating Xiao Yan by comparing him with that Burning Flame Ancestor of our Burning Flame Valley?\u201d Although Tang Huo Er had quite a good impression of Xiao Yan, her heart still felt that there was too much of a gap between Xiao Yan and the expert from that era.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, you should not underestimate him. I have the feeling that this Xiao Yan is not a simple person. I have nothing but praise for that Heavenly Flame fire lotus of his\u2026 moreover, he is only around twenty or so, yet he possesses many achievements in terms of alchemy and Dou Qi. Such a talent is something that even you are far inferior to\u2026\u201d Tang Zhen\u2019s eyes turned to Xiao Yan, who had his eyes shut. The regret in his eyes once again surged as he sighed.</p><br/><p>Tang Huo Er stuck up her small mouth. Although she was a little dissatisfied, the truth was indeed as she had witnessed. Hence, she could only mutter under her own breath. If this was before Xiao Yan had exchanged blows with Wu Chen, she would have confidently fought with him. However, after seeing that fire lotus, she had completely lost this intention because she knew that she would definitely die in the face of that fire lotus\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch a talented young person is not someone from my Burning Flame Valley. How can it not cause one to feel regretful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen let out a long sigh and ceased saying anything. He waved his sleeves and blew the dust on the ground away. After which, he sat down cross-legged and planned to wait on this spot until Xiao Yan awoke. Tang Huo Er could only sit down and accompany him when she saw him\u2026</p><br/><p>A day had passed after the two of them had sat down. Xiao Yan\u2019s body remained as still as a statue throughout the day without making the slightest movement. If his breathing hadn\u2019t remained consistent, it was likely that even Tang Zhen would have thought that some accident had occurred during the inheritance.</p><br/><p>The fiery-red crystal ball was continuously emitting a bright-red glow in the spacious hall, lighting up the hall until it appeared like it was daytime within. Xiao Yan still maintained with both his hands extended beside the crystal ball. However, his skin also appeared to release a vague red glow at this moment, causing it to appear extremely mysterious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is he still not done? Back then, my inheritance only lasted an hour\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Huo Er supported her cheeks with her hands while looking at the unmoving Xiao Yan. Finally, she could not resist opening her mouth to ask.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, you were lazy and did not absorb all of the experiences and improvements of the the ancestors within the crystal ball, yet Xiao Yan has chosen to absorb all of them\u2026\u201d Tang Zhen faintly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce I have digested all the experience that I have absorbed, I will still be able to continue absorbing\u2026\u201d Tang Huo Er extended her tongue and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, I really don\u2019t know what to do with you. Your talent is also extremely great. If you were a little more serious, the position of the Valley Chief of the Burning Flame Valley will definitely belong to you in the future. Moreover, with sufficient strength, even those old fellows whom you dislike will not be able to nag you\u2026\u201d Tang Zhen shook his head and helplessly teased.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye aye\u2026\u201d Tang Huo Er hurriedly nodded, seemingly afraid that Tang Zhen would continue his nagging.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen was even more helpless when he saw this. He shook his head before his expression suddenly changed. He turned to the crystal ball and saw the red glow swiftly disappear. Now, Xiao Yan\u2019s body was covered in a red glow. A moment later, both of his eyes trembled and were slowly opened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen hurriedly stood up, smiled, and asked when he saw Xiao Yan open his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s body remained still in the same spot. It seemed as though he was organizing the large amount of information within his head. This continued for a moment before his entire body shivered. A life force surged into his dull eyes. His gaze slid to Tang Zhen as he grinned and nodded. Immediately, he cupped his hands together and respectfully said, \u201cValley Chief Tang, thank you for your generous gift!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was clearly aware that he benefited by accepting such an inheritance. Moreover, his relationship with Tang Zhen was not considered a very good one. However, the things that Tang Zhen had done for him were indeed worthy of this formal thanks.</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen merely waved his hands randomly in the face of Xiao Yan\u2019s thanks. He smiled and said, \u201cThe complete training method of the Skyfire Three Mysterious Flame should be completely in your head, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan grinned and nodded. A thought passed through his mind and a mysterious training method immediately surfaced within it. This was the complete version of the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change. It included not only the first change but the second and third change training methods.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have finally obtained it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart was also exceptionally excited. With this Skyfire Three Mysterious Change, his fighting strength would swiftly rise!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Skyfire Three Mysterious Change might be able to allow you to raise your fighting strength significantly for a short period of time. However, the energy that you obtain will be exceptionally wild and violent. You should be careful when controlling it.\u201d Tang Zhen reminded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. This was something that he was already aware of. After all, he had practiced the first change of the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change for many years. He was already able to control the energy it created very well.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have already obtained the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change, let\u2019s leave the hall first\u2026\u201d Tang Zhen smiled. After which, he led the way down the hall. Xiao Yan and Tang Huo Er followed close behind.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mood was joyful as he left the Dou Qi Hall and felt the fresh air blowing on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cValley Chief Tang, I have already disturbed you for quite a number of days. Today, Xiao Yan shall leave. If there is anything you need help with in the future, you can come and look for me.\u201d Since the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change was already in his hands, there was naturally no longer any reason to remain in the Burning Flame Valley. Therefore, Xiao Yan immediately cupped his hands together and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you leaving\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen had the intention of getting Xiao Yan to stay, but when he heard this, he could only sigh in the end. He nodded and said, \u201cI think that you should have some important business. The old me shall not insist, but you must remember not to leak the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, Valley Chief Tang, please rest assured that Xiao Yan is not someone who does not understand the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He naturally understood such rules.</p><br/><p>Tang Zhen smiled. After which, he patted Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cIf you have time in the future, you can come to my Burning Flame Valley as a guest. As long as I, Tang Zhen, am still the Valley Chief of the Burning Flame Valley, you, Xiao Yan, will be a VIP in my Burning Flame Valley.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out a smile in the face of Tang Zhen\u2019s good intention. The two cupped their hands to each other. After which, their figures rose into the air, and they swiftly flew toward the exit of the Burning Flame Valley\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

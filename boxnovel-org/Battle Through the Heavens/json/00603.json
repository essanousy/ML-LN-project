The \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 possessed the greatest destructive strength in this world \u2014 strength that burned the sky and boiled the sea. Faced with such a strength, it was likely that there was no one, with the exception of those legendary elites who had trained their Dou Qi until it was on par with nature, who would not feel a trembling fear under it.</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s expression had also become extremely serious the instant the energy film seal shattered. He was too lazy to bother about the Gold Silver Brothers who were facing each other in front of him. Compared to these experts from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 who had engaged in a large scale invasion, Su Qian was more fearful of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 that was in the tower. A \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was itself already frightening. A \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 that had gathered and formed an intelligence was sufficient to cause others to quiver in fear at the mere mention of it. These fellows from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 may be greedy, unscrupulous and vicious fellows, but even if they were given a hundred times their courage, they would not dare to extend their hands toward the students of the Inner Academy. These students originated from all over the continent. Most of them had some factions behind them. Perhaps these factions may not be very strong if they were separated. However, if they were to gather together, even the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 would have difficulty enduring such a fury. Moreover\u2026 the Jia Nan Academy\u2019s foundation was naturally not weak after being able to stand on the continent for so many years. However, some things would seldom be taken out unless it came to a true situation of life and death.</p><br/><p>One example was the Elders guarding the hall whom Xiao Yan had met when he and the others had entered the mysterious valley after having obtained the top five of the \u2018Qualifying Competition\u2019. The strength of those two were definitely not weaker than Hu Gan. If they were to intervene, these fellows from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 would have long been totally defeated.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll Elders from the Inner Academy, listen up. Form the formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s gaze flickered. He suddenly let out a stern cry and actually completely ignored the Gold Silver Brothers as well as the numerous experts from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 who were looking at them with malice while crying out to all the Elders.</p><br/><p>All the Elders were startled when they heard Su Qian\u2019s cry. Their gaze swept across the experts from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 who were around them. They hesitated a little before moving their bodies swiftly to the sky above the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 and forming the great sealing formation from earlier.</p><br/><p>Those experts from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 swiftly gathered together after seeing the action of the Elders of the Inner Academy. Their gazes had great interest as they looked at the broken top of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, Mister Han, is now the best chance for us to attack and defeat them now that the Elders of the Inner Academy are too busy dealing with their own things?\u201d An old man who looked like a dark eagle eyed the Elders who were going all out in unleashing their Dou Qi with the intent of sealing the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 once again, and gave Han Feng a strange laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, Old Ban need not be so anxious. After the great battle earlier, the Elders of the Inner Academy have already been quite badly exhausted. On the other hand, the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 has been recharging its strength. It won\u2019t be so easy for them to seal it now. They might even suffer great losses under the attack by the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.\u201d Han Feng shook his head and laughed, \u201cWe can wait for them to fight until they are both severely injured before taking action to snatch the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Han Feng spoke in this manner, he had another thought within his heart. Although he had gained the advantage after having gathered a large group of helpers, he was no fool. He clearly knew that the foundation of the Jia Nan Academy was quite firm. If they were to truly anger them, it was likely that every single one of them would suffer. His aim was only the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, and he did not want to form a blood feud with the Jia Nan Academy because of it.</p><br/><p>Snatching the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 may cause the relationship between both parties to become extremely bad, but there was still a gap between that and a blood feud. Those experts of the Jia Nan Academy in seclusion may be able to accept the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 being snatched, but they would not accept a situation where over half the Elders were injured or dead.</p><br/><p>That old man who was called old Ban frowned a little upon hearing this but could only nod his head. He originally had an extremely deep grudge with the Jia Nan Academy. Therefore, his faction frequently came into conflict with the academy\u2019s Law Enforcement Unit, and would suffer great injuries and deaths each time around. Naturally, they did not want to give up this rare opportunity to greatly hurt the academy.</p><br/><p>Waves of a faint energy barrier once again surfaced following the surging Dou Qi from the Elders in the sky. However, the energy barrier this time around was undoubtedly much weaker and thinner than before. Clearly, the Elders had suffered quite a great burden from the great battle earlier.</p><br/><p>During the time that Han Feng was conversing, a bloody figure suddenly rushed over before carefully squeezing into the crowd. His gaze was dark and vicious while containing a thread of fear as he stared at the black-robed, young man who was a short distance away.</p><br/><p>The blood figure that rushed in was naturally Fan Lao. However, his figure was now completely different from his previous one. His appearance was as though he was on his last breath and could die at any time.</p><br/><p>The experts from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 around him may gloat a little upon seeing Fan Lao\u2019s miserable manner, however, they felt a greater amount of shock and seriousness. The former was actually turned into such a miserable state by the skinny, young man despite his strength. Just how powerful was that fellow?</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Leader Fan, are you alright?\u201d Han Feng was also shocked for a moment by the appearance of Fan Lao. A moment later, he knit his brows and took out a medicinal pill from his storage ring before shoving it to Fan Lao.</p><br/><p>Fan Lao basically snatched the medicinal pill before stuffing into his mouth. He let out a deep breath as a sleek redness surfaced on his pale-white face. His gaze was dark and vicious as he stared at the black-robed, young man who was flapping his pair of green flame wings. His voice was a little dry and hoarse, \u201cThat fellow\u2019s \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 restrained me. Otherwise, he would have suffered.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone naturally did not know whether to agree or disagree to such excuses. All of them had sensed something from the fight between Fan Lao and Xiao Yan. The Dou Technique that the latter used was not any weaker than Fan Lao. It was likely that even without the issue of one Dou Qi subduing the other, Fan Lao\u2019s defeat was still only a matter of time.</p><br/><p>Han Feng\u2019s gaze flickered. He stared at Xiao Yan in the distance as a thought rolled in his heart, \u201cThis young man was able to defeat the four star Dou Huang Fan Lao. Even with the elimination of the restraint his affinity poses on the latter, his strength should be within that of a five star Dou Huang. If I were to meet him alone, it is possible to defeat him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Han Feng also clearly knew that Xiao Yan controlled quite a strong Dou Technique, he had usually gathered some good things from helping others refine medicinal pill as a tier 6 alchemist. Naturally, he did not lack any good things. A Di class Dou Technique may be extremely rare to others but it would not cause him to be surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to find time and investigate this young man\u2019s background. After which, I will look for an opportunity to capture him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The green fire wings were slowly flapping behind Xiao Yan as he watched Fan Lao who had rushed into the circle consisting of the experts from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. He involuntarily knit his brows. This crafty old fellow. Now that there were so many strong people guarding him, it would not be easy to kill him. Fortunately, he was able to badly hurt him in today\u2019s battle despite not being able to kill him. He may have even left behind an injury that was difficult to completely recover from. At that time, this old fellow would have difficulty entering an even higher level regardless of what kind of tactic he used.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan suddenly became alert as this thought flashed across his heart. He suddenly turned his gaze toward Han Feng who was beside Fan Lao. Four eyes looked at each other. Both parties contained a dense, cold killing intent that only they understood in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan clenched his five fingers slowly. However, Yao Lao\u2019s soft voice suddenly sounded in his heart at this very moment, \u201cDon\u2019t be reckless. That fellow has quite a number of strong people around him. You will not be able to deal with them even if you unleash the strength that I can loan you to the maximum. I will repeat myself again. Unless you have reached the Dou Wang class, you should reduce a head on collision with them. You should know just how powerful a person who has practiced \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 and swallowed a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is. Although he may have practiced an incomplete Qi Method, one should still not underestimate him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan clenched his teeth viciously. He hesitated for a moment before slowly releasing his tightly gripped fist. He could not be rash at this moment\u2026 however, if he wanted to advance to a Dou Wang\u2026 ah, he would at least require two years even with his current pace. This gap was really too wide. That class which was called the barrier between the ordinary and the strong in the continent was not so easy to break through.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed softly. He turned his head and threw his gaze to the top of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019. His heart quietly surged. This thing was the crucial factor in deciding if he could swiftly advance to the Dou Wang class. Hence, he must obtain it regardless of what happens.</p><br/><p>The people in the sky each contained their own thoughts. The sealing formation that was controlled by Su Qian once again emitted an intense glow. However, just as the glow had reached its peak level, the top of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 which had been without movement finally emitted a sharp hissing sound. Immediately, a substance-like sonic wave formed a ripple shape as it hurriedly spread out, destroying the originally miserable surroundings until they were a complete mess.</p><br/><p>That large body also surged out in front of numerous shocked gazes under a thunder-like explosion while the sonic wave sounded. The invisible flame that shot in all directions was like a storm as it violently smashed into the energy barrier around it. That powerful strike caused the energy barrier to swiftly form waves of ripples that faintly showed signs of collapsing.</p><br/><p>The instant the collision occurred, the expressions of quite a number of Elders became slightly paler. Their aura also gradually became much weaker.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 this is the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 of the Inner Academy? Heavens, it has actually evolved until it is close to forming a corporeal form!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those experts from the \u2018Black-Corner Region,\u2019 who saw the huge invisible snake occupying an enormous part of the sky for the first time, immediately let out a shocked cry. Their faces were stunned.</p><br/><p>Han Feng was also shocked by the immensity of the body of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. Soon after, however, his face contained a joy that was difficult to hide. If he was able to successfully refine and swallow it, it was likely that he would be able to break the barrier between a Dou Huang and a Dou Zong.</p><br/><p>\u201cJi!\u201d</p><br/><p>A strange hissing sound once again resounded through the sky. The invisible fire python appeared to be aware that the seal was about to break. It immediately swung its tail and its huge body was like lightning as it carried a momentum that caused even space to vibrate as it violently struck a part of the energy barrier!</p><br/><p>\u201cCrack\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Following this powerful collision, the energy barrier that was rippling swiftly finally emitted a clear sound that indicated it could not handle the great burden. A small crack line suddenly appeared under the shocked gazes of the Elders before beginning to completely cover the energy barrier much like a spiderweb.</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s expression was ugly as he watched the energy barrier which was covered with crack lines and about to break. He knew that the seal had already failed\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The enormous head of the python collided violently into the energy barrier which was about to break. That enormous strength finally shattered it. In an instant, the energy fragments danced all over the sky. The cylinder-like energy barrier was completely shattered at this moment...</p><br/><p>A strange crazy hiss that contained a wild joy erupted from the ferocious, large mouth of the huge invisible python like a thunderstrike the moment the energy barrier was broken!</p><br/><p>The invisible fire python did not flee immediately after having escaped its restraints. Instead, it suddenly raised its head. Its dark, cold snake eyes stared firmly at Xiao Yan and Han Feng. Its eyes contained an extremely human-like greed and desire.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

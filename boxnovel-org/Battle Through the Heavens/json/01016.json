Only when the sky gradually became bright did he, who was still in a rock house, slowly open his eyes.</p><br/><p>An entire night\u2019s refinement did not cause Xiao Yan to feel the least bit tired. Instead, due to the replenishment of the enormous amount of Dou Qi, his condition was perfectly at his peak. A faint glow was flickering while he blinked. This was due to the great surge of Dou Qi in his body that was difficult to hide.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lowered his head and looked at the Demon Poison Spot on his chest. At the moment, it\u2019s size had clearly shrunk a little. Xiao Yan shook his head with some dissatisfaction when he saw this. He had at least removed ten bundles of poison during the night. It was unexpected that this amount was such a small portion when compared to the Demon Poison Spot as a whole.</p><br/><p>After having absorbed all the Dou Qi within the ten clusters of poison, Xiao Yan could vaguely feel that his strength had improved. Although this feeling was not very obvious, it was considered quite incredible. After all, each star within the Dou Zong class required an extremely great amount of energy. If Xiao Yan were to train in an orthodox fashion, it was likely that he would require nearly three to four months in order to reach this stage even with his speed, yet he was able to reach it in one night. This effectiveness was already quite great.</p><br/><p>There was a massive gap between every star within the Dou Zong class. Hence, the classification within the expert Dou Zongs were a little more detailed in the Central Plains. Every star was divided into four levels. They were entry, intermediate, advance, and peak. However, such differentiation was too subtle. Hence, very few people would measure another in such a manner. However, it was quite useful when using it to measure one\u2019s own strength. According to Xiao Yan\u2019s guess, he should be currently at the intermediate level after having absorbed the Dou Qi within the Demon Poison Spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, it is indeed very difficult to raise one\u2019s level in the Dou Zong class. No wonder First Elder\u2019s level did not experience a great increase despite having trained for so many years\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan sighed softly in his heart. He took out his clothes and put them back on. Currently, the Dou Qi in his body had reached saturation and needed a period of time of adaptation before he could once again absorb Dou Qi from the Demon Poison Spot. Fortunately, with his current strength, the Demon Poison Spot no longer posed a fatal threat to him. Instead, this thing was treated as a movable Dou Qi warehouse by Xiao Yan...</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it is time to leave. The Four Pavilion Grand Meeting is about to be held in a few days\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan leaped down from the bed. He mused for a moment before packing his things properly. After which, he did not stay any longer. He pushed opened the door and simply walked out.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Yan walked out of the room, the Gold Swallowing Mice guards standing by the side hurriedly bowed to Xiao Yan. His waved his hand and without saying anything, stepped onto the empty air, and appeared to be walking on the stairs leading to heaven as ascended into the sky in front of the envious eyes of those few guards.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan overlooked the Heaven Eye Mountain as he stood in the sky. He involuntarily smiled and walked forward. This was something that he had dreamed of. It was unexpected that he was able to fulfill it now\u2026</p><br/><p>Two figures hurried over when Xiao Yan rose into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother Xiao Yan, are you going to leave now?\u201d Jin Shi appeared. He looked at Xiao Yan and hurriedly asked.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded and laughed, \u201cI still have some matters to attend to and cannot remain here for long. Thank you both for your great hospitality. If I have time in the future, I will come and visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jin Shi and Jin Gu could not say any other words to get Xiao Yan to stay after they heard this. They immediately replied in deep voices, \u201cLittle brother Xiao Yan, the Gold Swallowing Mouse Tribe owes you a big favor. If you meet any trouble in the future, please do not forget about us old fellows.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan titled his head. The Gold Swallowing Mouse faction a large population, and remained up to date with the news in the Central Plains region. It was naturally a good thing to befriend them.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, looking at your anxious face, the two of us shall not hold you back any longer. We will pray for your journey to be smooth.\u201d Jin Gu smiled, cupped his hands, and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I shall borrow elder Jin Gu\u2019s blessing. Goodbye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He cupped his hands to the two of them and did not stay any longer. His body moved and transformed into a light figure, which rushed out of the Heaven Eye Mountain Range with a \u2018swoosh\u2019 sound. Within a couple of blinks, he had already disappeared from Jin Shi\u2019s and Jin Gu\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>......</p><br/><p>With Xiao Yan\u2019s speed, he had already exited the region of the Heaven Eye Mountain Range within ten plus minutes. Originally, with his current strength, his speed would have been a little faster if he used the bone wings. However, the words of the Gray Wolf King were firmly etched in his heart. Although he had currently advanced to the Dou Zong class, this strength was really insignificant when compared to the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe. Hence, unless it was a critical moment, it was best that he used the bone wings as little as possible in the future.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s figure stopped on a mountain peak outside of the Heaven Eye Mountain Range. He took a map of the northern region from his Space Ring. The map he had purchased in Bone Transforming City back then. After which, he began to search for something on it.</p><br/><p>According to what Mu Qing Luan had mentioned, the Four Pavilion Grand Meeting this time around would be held at the headquarters of the Wind Lightning Pavilion, which was the eastern pavilion. Based on the map, the position of the eastern pavilion should be near the border between the northern and middle region of the Central Plains.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is so far away. Looks like I will need about five days just to travel there\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan bitterly laughed after putting the map back into his Storage Ring. It was fortunate that had reached the level of a Dou Zong. Otherwise, it was likely that he would not have been able to hurry to the eastern pavilion without ten days to half a month's time. At that time, it was likely that the gathering would have ended.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like I should travel quickly. Otherwise, it will be unlucky if I miss it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed as he faced the eastern sky. A bright-silver glow slowly surfaced on his feet. Immediately, muffled thunder sounded. His body disappeared in a ghost-like manner.</p><br/><p>........</p><br/><p>The name of the Wind Lightning Eastern Pavilion held a heavy weight throughout the Central Plains region. Being the headquarters of the Wind Lightning Pavilion, this place was filled with many experts. Its defenses were also extremely solid. During the years since the Wind Lightning Pavilion had been founded, it had experienced quite a number of tribulations. However, the eastern pavilion had always remained standing. Its reputation had gradually formed from many fights between factions. Only after all that, did it gain its current status.</p><br/><p>The Four Pavilion Grand Meeting, as the name suggested, was naturally conducted by the four pavilions in the Central Plains. Although the main characters were the four pavilions, each season of the Four Pavilion Grand Meeting would be a grand event within the Central Plains region. Although it could not be put in the same category as the Pill Gathering of the Pill Tower, it was also a rare event.</p><br/><p>This Four Pavilion Grand Meeting was not a competition between the experts of the older generations. Instead, it was a competition for the younger generation. Of course, the younger generation, who could represent the four Pavilions, were naturally the most outstanding people among the younger generation of each party. New blood was the most important thing if each faction wanted to survive. Hence, the four pavilions paid great attention to the younger generation.</p><br/><p>Under their great focus on grooming the younger generation, it was natural that quite a number of outstanding individuals had appeared among them: the Wind Lightning Pavilion\u2019s Feng Qing Er, the Ten Thousand Sword Pavilion\u2019s Tang Ying, the Yellow Spring Pavilion\u2019s Wang Chen, the Falling Star Pavilion\u2019s Mu Qing Luan, etc. All of these people possessed some reputation across the entire Central Plains region.</p><br/><p>Of course, the Central Plains was one where many outstanding individuals were hidden. No one knew just where dark horse would suddenly appear. Even though this was the case, each of the Four Pavilion Grand Meeting would attract a countless number of strong young people from many factions. The main characters of this Grand Meeting were usually the four pavilions, but it did not reject some other competitors. However, in order to increase the quality, it naturally possessed a necessary filter. Moreover, it was rumored to be extremely harsh. This had eliminated some of the people who were there simply to inflate the numbers.</p><br/><p>After all, among the competitions between the younger generation, the Four Pavilion Grand Meeting was considered to be of a superior quality. Even some of the experts from the older generation had difficulty achieving the requirements.</p><br/><p>The location where the Four Pavilion Grand Meeting would be held was usually decided by the party who had won the last season\u2019s competition. The victor of the last Grand Meeting was the Wind Lightning Pavilion, Hence, the location this time was decided to be the Wind Lightning Eastern Pavilion.</p><br/><p>.......</p><br/><p>The Wind Lightning Eastern Pavilion was situated in the Wind Lightning Mountain Range near the border of the northern region. This place was extremely unique. Perhaps it was because the terrain was too high, but there was always a rumbling thunder sound. The weather was also unpredictable. At first it may be extremely sunny, but the next moment, a thunderstorm may appear.</p><br/><p>The entire Wind Lightning Mountain Range was the territory controlled by the eastern pavilion. This place was just like their backyard. Other factions who were not strong did not dare to encroach into this area.</p><br/><p>The Wind Lightning Mountain Range during this period of time was unusually lively. A countless number of people came from all over the place and gathered at the Lightning Mountain within the mountain range. This was because above the Lightning Mountain stood the headquarters of the Wind Lightning Pavilion, the eastern pavilion!</p><br/><p>......</p><br/><p>A ray of light bounded across the sky outside of the Wind Lightning Mountain Range like a falling star. It transformed into a person that landed on the top of a mountain. He lowered his head and looked at the ant-like human flow below only to be stunned.</p><br/><p>The person who had hurried over was naturally Xiao Yan, who had increased his speed along the way. He had basically gone all out during these few days, and had seldom rested along the way. Even by hurrying in this manner, he had exhausted four days in order to reach this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis area has a very dense Wind Lightning Strength\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently exhaled. He looked into the distance and saw the mountain range, which was many times larger than the Heaven Eye Mountain Range. There was a shocking rumbling thunder within this mountain range he could feel despite being a great distance away. The Wind Lightning Strength contained within the mountain range caused his expression to alter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place should be the Wind Lightning Mountain Range where the Wind Lightning Pavilion Eastern Pavilion is located. Looks like I\u2019m not late\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

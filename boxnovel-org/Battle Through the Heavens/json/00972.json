They were all scattered and their gazes were carefully scanning the mountain range below. These were all people who had come chasing after Xiao Yan. Each of them carried an incomparable anger and killing intent. However, they were unaware of just what Xiao Yan was thinking at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cChen Yun, didn\u2019t you say that that brat had been struck by your Blood Lightning Seal? You should be able to detect his exact spot. Where is he?\u201d A red-clothed, yellow-faced, old man finally turned his head furiously demanded information from the gray-clothed, old man beside him after failing to find any traces despite having searched for awhile.</p><br/><p>Chen Yun\u2019s expression was a little gloomy at this moment. He had sensed that his connection with the Blood Lightning Seal was weakening on his way here, especially when he had just entered the area around the mountain range. That connection had been completely broken at that moment. Hence, he could only rely on the route transmitted by the slight connection earlier to search. However, it was a futile effort despite having spent such a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know just what method that brat used to remove the Blood Lightning Seal that I left in his body.\u201d Chen Yun gloomily replied. Honestly speaking, he was feeling extremely shocked at this moment. The difficulty involved in removing the Blood Lightning Seal was something that he understood extremely well. However, it had been dispelled within less than half a day. This was the first time that he had been met with such an occurrence in all his years.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you have great confidence in your Blood Lightning Seal? If I knew that this would be the case, the old me would have directly given chase!\u201d Hong Tian Xiao became furious upon hearing this. If they were to lose the connection, how would they find that brat after he had fled a great distance?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you roaring for? You give chase? Hmph. Would you not have long since given chase if you had not been afraid of the puppet in that brat\u2019s hand?\u201d Chen Yun frowned and spoke in a somewhat irritated manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you are speaking nonsense. Would the old me be afraid of that brat\u2019s puppet?\u201d Hong Tian Xiao furiously cried out.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce we find him, you can go and deal with that puppet\u2026\u201d Chen Yun coldly laughed. He immediately waved his hand and a deep voice sounded, \u201cAll of you should head down and search the place an inch at a time. That brat is definitely still in this mountain range. I don\u2019t believe that he can flee under my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The dozen experts in the sky were startled for a moment upon hearing Chen Yun\u2019s orders before they turned their gazes to Hong Tian Xiao. They were the people invited by the Hong clan. Naturally, they needed to hear Hong Tian Xiao\u2019s instruction.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo as he said.\u201d Hong Tian Xiao swung his sleeves and commanded them.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dozen plus invited helpers from the Hong clan finally cupped their hands and spread out after hearing the order. They slowly descended, formed a fan shape, and began searching the mountain range.</p><br/><p>Two human figures quietly flashed and appeared within a lush green forest behind Hong Tian Xiao\u2019s group while they were searching for Xiao Yan. The lady among them was surprisingly Han Xue. Standing beside her was a white-clothed old man with a bitter smile. The old man\u2019s gaze passed through the gap between the branches and looked at Chen Yun\u2019s group in the distant sky. A solemn expression flashed in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat-grandfather, will they find Xiao Yan?\u201d Han Xue\u2019s searing hot eyes looked at the invited helpers of the Hong clan as they searched the place carefully before involuntarily asking in a concerned manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, girl, although the old me was unable to endure your tantrum and ended up bringing you over to take a look, I will still say some ugly words first. If any situation occurs when the time comes, I will try my best to lend a hand on the precondition that no one will discover my identity. You should understand great-grandfather. It is fine if it was just that Hong Tian Xiao. However, Chen Yun is a member of the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Our Han clan cannot offend that kind of faction\u2026\u201d The white-clothed, old man sighed as he spoke with a somewhat solemn face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have taken the risk to bring you over mainly because that little fellow helped our Han clan. The old me does not like to owe another a favor. Otherwise, regardless of how nice you put it, I will not treat a big matter like offending the Wind Lightning Pavilion as child\u2019s play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xue gently bit her lower red lip with the back of her teeth as she quietly nodded. She softly said, \u201cXue-er knows her limits. At\u2026 at that time, great-grandfather should intervene based on the situation\u2026 if it is not possible, then just leave\u2026\u201d Her round eyes had immediately become much redder at the end of her words.</p><br/><p>The white-clothed, old man once again laughed bitterly when he saw this manner of hers. He rubbed Han Xue\u2019s smooth black hair and sighed, \u201cUgh, by being able to make my little grand-daughter act like this, this little fellow called Xiao Yan really does have some skill\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xue\u2019s pretty face revealed embarrassment when she heard his words. She was just about to speak when a \u2018bang\u2019 sounded in the distant mountain range. Upon the sounding of the explosion, numerous whistling sounds began to be transmitted from the distance. One could even hear a faint cry of \u201che is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas he been discovered?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xue\u2019s hands were tightly clenched.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, I thought that you had wished to hide for an entire lifetime!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Yun spoke with ridicule. His figure was suspended in the sky as his sinister gaze looked at the young man who was slowly walking out of a cave.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are really quite a lot of people who have come. Looks like Elder Chen really hates me\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze swept over the sky around him. Finally, they paused on Hong Tian Xiao\u2019s body while he spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce you land in my hands, you will clearly experience the hatred of the old me.\u201d Chen Yun viciously spoke. The faint pain that was being transmitted from his hand was just like a thorn ruthlessly piercing into his heart. That humiliation caused the killing intent in his heart to surge.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, this time around, the old me wants to see just how you will be able to flee! I have promised my nephew that I will break all your limbs and bring you to him.\u201d Hong Tian Xiao\u2019s gaze revealed a fierce glow as he stared at Xiao Yan. His sinister voice caused the surrounding helpers invited by the Hong clan to feel a chill in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lips curled. However, this smile of his contained a frosty chill.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like the two of you really wish to render me dead and will definitely not give up. In that cause\u2026 allow me to take both of your lives\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Tian Xiao immediately laughed upon seeing the smile on Xiao Yan\u2019s face. He mocked, \u201cArrogant young man. Do you really think that a puppet can save your life?\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Xiao Yan\u2019s face involuntarily became a little stranger when he heard this. He flicked his finger and a silver glow flashed. The Earth Demon Puppet also surfaced in front of him.</p><br/><p>Seeing the appearance of this Earth Demon Puppet, the helpers of the Han clan in the sky hurriedly withdrew a little. They were also extremely terrified of this fierce puppet, which had broken off one of Chen Yun\u2019s finger.</p><br/><p>Hong Tian Xiao\u2019s eyes also solidified slightly when the Earth Demon Puppet appeared. His face became slightly solemn. The troublesomeness of this puppet was something that he was also clearly aware of.</p><br/><p>\u201cHong Tian Xiao, since you said thosr words earlier, we\u2019ll leave this puppet to you. Leave that brat to me to deal with.\u201d Chen Yun\u2019s eyes also flickered slightly as they stared at the Earth Demon Puppet. There was a faint fear within them. Finally, he turned his head and spoke to Hong Tian Xiao.</p><br/><p>Hong Tian Xiao\u2019s face immediately twitched a little upon hearing these words. He inhaled a deep breath of air and coldly laughed, \u201cLeave it to the old me. You, on the other hand, should finish that brat off as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, this time around, the old me will let him know that offending the Wind Lightning Pavilion was his greatest mistake!\u201d Chen Yun\u2019s gaze looked at Xiao Yan in a savage manner as he spoke in a dense voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan merely smiled in the face of these two old fellows ill intent. His finger gently rubbed the snow-white ring without leaving a trace. After which, he suddenly pointed at Hong Tian Xiao and softly said, \u201cKill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Earth Demon Puppet in front of him stomped heavily on the ground just after Xiao Yan\u2019s voice had sounded. The mountain rocks cracked and the Earth Demon Puppet\u2019s body shot toward the sky like a fire arrow. It violently flew toward Hong Tian Xiao.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, allow the old me to see just how great is this puppet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Tian Xiao coldly laughed when he saw the Earth Demon Puppet coming at him with a fierce momentum. Fiery-red Dou Qi surged out of his body like a flame in all directions. His hand was clenched and a two-meter-long scimitar appeared in his hand. The scimitar emitted a hot force when it was swung and violently hacked at the Earth Demon Puppet.</p><br/><p>\u201cClang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The scimitar hacked at the Earth Demon Puppet\u2019s shoulder. However, only some sparks were created. A white scar also appeared where the blade landed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a hard body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Tian Xiao was slightly startled when he saw this. He tightly re-gripped the scimitar. He then collided head-on with the Earth Demon Puppet, and an intense big battle erupted.</p><br/><p>Chen Yun slowly lowered his body while Hong Tian Xiao was pestering the Earth Demon Puppet. He remained suspended in the sky just in front of Xiao Yan. His dried face revealed a frightening smile as he slowly spoke in a dense voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, you have broken off a finger of mine. Later, I will completely cripple all ten fingers of yours!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled faintly. His feet stomped on the ground as his body rose. A short while later, he drifted and landed on a large tree.</p><br/><p>Chen Yun\u2019s hands were merely placed behind him as he watched Xiao Yan\u2019s actions. His eyes revealed ridicule as he watched Xiao Yan move From the way he saw it, Xiao Yan was merely a mouse struggling before it died in this situation. Moreover, he was the cat playing with the mouse\u2026 however, this was merely his wishful thinking.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan completely ignored the ridicule in Chen Yun\u2019s eyes. His hands were slowly spread apart as he gradually shut his eyes. A soft mutter sounded within his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld mister Yao, please temporarily lend your strength to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A soft mutter slowly sounded. A moment later, the snow-white ring on Xiao Yan\u2019s finger shook gently. Immediately, an extremely majestic and vast Spiritual Strength moved along Xiao Yan\u2019s arm, wildly surging into him in a flood like manner!</p><br/><p>With the pouring of the majestic Spiritual Strength into Xiao Yan\u2019s body, the space around him had suddenly, but slowly become distorted. A monstrous aura that was like an awakened emperor that dominated this world!</p><br/><p>Chen Yun, those helpers from the Hong clan around and even Hong Tian Xiao, who was fighting the Earth Demon Puppet, felt a momentary dullness within their heads the instant this monstrous aura appeared. Immediately, shock that was difficult to restrain surged from deep within their hearts in a manner similar to wild grass.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

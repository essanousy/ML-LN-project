He swallowed his saliva and began to slowly turn around. His gaze stared intently at the enormous snake which was repeatedly shedding its charred black skin. Carefully taking a few steps back, he hurriedly asked, \u201cTeacher, what is happening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWithin the snake body, a Qi has appeared \u2026\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s voice at the moment was much more serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe succeeded in evolving?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes shrunk as he asked dryly.</p><br/><p>\u201c... Seems like it. Be careful.\u201d Yao Lao was also uncertain of what was happening. Thus, his reply was also somewhat vague.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan felt his heart sink. An instant later, he tilted his head toward the green-colored flame in midair and said decisively, \u201cTeacher. How do we obtain the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019? Hurry up, there\u2019s no time. Once that thing comes out, I\u2019m afraid that we will\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d Before Xiao Yan could complete saying what he wanted to say, Yao Lao\u2019s hurried warning suddenly sounded in his heart.</p><br/><p>When Yao Lao\u2019s cry sounded, Xiao Yan\u2019s heart suddenly tightened. After over a year of tough training, Xiao Yan had obtained the ability to constantly remain alert. His expression immediately changed, the tip of his legs gently tapped on the ground and his body hurriedly pulled back. \u201cBang!\u201d As Xiao Yan was hurriedly pulling back, the huge snake corpse on the ground suddenly emitted an explosive sound. The black scales flew in all directions and the corpse instantly turned into powder.</p><br/><p>At that instant when the huge snake corpse turned into powder, a vast and frightening Qi was suddenly released and swiftly covered the entire city at a speed that caused others to feel dismay.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer Majesty has succeeded?\u201d Sensing the faintly familiar feel of this Qi, countless Snake-People in the city faced each other. Instantly, their faces were filled with unrestrained joy as an earth shaking cheer sounded throughout the clouds.</p><br/><p>The instant when this vast Qi erupted, the expression of Gu He, who was outside the purple-colored curtain, changed drastically. At the same time, his body involuntarily and quickly retreated over dozens of meters.</p><br/><p>As his figure was hurriedly pulling back, Gu He wore an ugly expression as he shouted to the black-robed person who was quietly standing in midair, \u201cLet\u2019s leave quickly. Queen Medusa had successfully evolved!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic!\u201d Facing the sudden surge of energy from the terrifying Qi, the black-robed person still remained calm. Other people may have difficulty sensing the irregularity within the Qi but she could clearly sense it. This Qi may be so strong that it was frightening but it had a faint feeling of lacking the strength to persist.</p><br/><p>Her senses were not incorrect. After this Qi had erupted, it only lasted for over ten seconds before it shrunk back into the light curtain like a tide retreating from the beach.</p><br/><p>Following the Qi being extinguished once again, the cheers in the city also suddenly stopped. All of the Snake-People had stunned faces and their hearts were anxiously for the result of the new development.</p><br/><p>When that Qi suddenly erupted, Xiao Yan\u2019s face paled significantly. His feet stepped on the ground and in the blink of an eye, pulled back for over ten meters.</p><br/><p>The extinguishment of the Qi also caused Xiao Yan\u2019s heart to be dumbfounded. However, he did not dare to take things lightly at the moment. Narrowing his eyes slightly, he stared intently at the region a distance away that had some black-colored dust caused by the snake body exploding. His palms were covered with perspiration.</p><br/><p>The black-colored dust gradually showered downwards. In an instant, a seven-colored light abruptly shot out from the fog. The speed of the light was so quick that one could not react, much like it had penetrated the resistance of the space.</p><br/><p>In Xiao Yan\u2019s dark black eyes, the seven-colored glow flashed. Xiao Yan\u2019s face was startled. Before he had a clear idea of what the thing was he did not dare to have any skin contact with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit. Its speed is too fast!\u201d Even though Xiao Yan wanted to dodge, the speed of the seven-colored light was so fast that it was frightening. Even Yun Zhi, the one with the fastest speed he had ever seen back in the Magic Beast Mountain Range, was clearly slower than the light by an entire level.</p><br/><p>The Dou Qi in Xiao Yan\u2019s body had just moved when the sharp breaking wind sound that the seven-colored light carried reverberated by the side of his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang\u2026\u201d At the moment when things grew very dangerous, a thick white flame abruptly soared from Xiao Yan\u2019s body. The high temperature grilled the surrounding air till it became distorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhi!\u201d Seemingly having sensed the strength of the thick white flame, that seven-colored light which had hurriedly shot toward Xiao Yan did not advance any further. It suddenly stopped its body in front of Xiao Yan. The change from extreme speed to extreme silence was done in an almost completely natural manner without the slightest feeling of distortion.</p><br/><p>The seven-colored light stopped a few centimeters in front of Xiao Yan and finally revealed its body to Xiao Yan\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>The shock caused by the unavoidable collision was still present on Xiao Yan\u2019s face but when he saw the living creature that appeared in front of him, the shock was involuntarily turned into a stunned and dull expression, presenting quite an exciting scene.</p><br/><p>The living creature that had appeared in front of Xiao Yan was a narrow small snake that was only around two centimeters long. Its body was covered with tiny seven-colored scales and its pale purple eyes had a faint bewitching feeling. A unique fresh scent was shrouded around its body. Although it was currently only a snake, both elegance and nobility seeped out from it.</p><br/><p>The small snake did not appear to be vicious looking but it was beautiful to a ridiculous extent. This kind of beautiful living creature may well cause many ladies to forget about their fear and disgust for snakes.</p><br/><p>The entire body of the seven-colored small snake did not have many sharp attacking spots. However, Xiao Yan could vaguely sense a terrifying strength, that even a Dou Huang would not dare underestimate, within its small body.</p><br/><p>The small snake was suspended in midair in front of Xiao Yan. Its pale purple-colored pupils did not have the slightest killing aura. Instead, it appeared extremely pure and clean. Although Xiao Yan clearly knew that this small snake may have been transformed from Queen Medusa whose vicious reputation had frightened the few empires surrounding the desert, he could not find himself raising any hard feelings against the small snake in his heart.</p><br/><p>The seven-colored small snake swayed its tiny tail, widened its purple-colored pupils and watched Xiao Yan who was in front of it. It tried to get slightly closer to Xiao Yan but was also frightened by the thick white flame surrounding Xiao Yan\u2019s body. Immediately, it hurriedly shrank back, curling up its body. The pale purple eyes actually carried an extremely pitiful look as the snake eyed Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>With a stiffened body, Xiao Yan stared at the seven-colored small snake in front of him that appeared totally harmless. He did not dare make the slightest move. Swallowing his saliva, he asked blankly in his heart, \u201cTeacher\u2026 it\u2026 this is Queen Medusa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Yao Lao said stuffily as he nodded his head. He let out a soft sigh and muttered, \u201cIts body is seven-colored, its eyes are slightly purple, its body emits a fragrance, its strength is overwhelming\u2026 How unexpected. The so called evolution of Queen Medusa is actually evolving her spirit, abandoning the original shell and using her Spiritual Strength to agglomerate into a genuine and new body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c... Then what is this thing that she has currently evolved into?\u201d Xiao Yan asked apprehensively.</p><br/><p>\u201cQueen Medusa\u2019s previous accompanying spirit was the enormous purple snake that you saw just now. That spirit was a rank six Magic Beast, the Quiet Purple Flame Serpent. According to legends, this Quiet Purple Flame Serpent can activate their faint bloodline within their bodies and transform into their ancient ancestor. Naturally, the chances of this happening are extremely meager. They are so meager that it can be simply neglected.\u201d Yao Lao said softly, \u201cThat ancient exotic beast that could once contend with those at the Dou Sheng level was called \u2018Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019. Its differentiating point is its seven-colored body, its slight purple pupils, its body fragrance and its strength\u2026 overwhelming.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is exactly the same as the seven-colored small snake in front of me\u2026\u201d The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes twitched as he moaned in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. If I guess correctly, the small snake in front of you should be the legendary \u2018Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019... At the same time it is also Queen Medusa\u2019s new body.\u201d Yao Lao sighed.</p><br/><p>Swallowing his saliva, Xiao Yan eyed this harmless looking beautiful small snake with some disbelief. This thing, was the ancient exotic beast that could contend with the legendary Dou Sheng class?</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 that\u2019s not right. If it really is Queen Medusa, why is it that I cannot feel the slightest killing intent for me. According to common sense\u2026 if it really were that vicious woman, I\u2019m afraid that I would have already died on the spot.\u201d Staring at the baby like curiosity within the small snake\u2019s pupils, Xiao Yan asked, feeling at a loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d Yao Lao said with embarrassment: \u201cPerhaps\u2026 when it was evolving, it became stupid after being struck by the lightning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d Hearing Yao Lao\u2019s words, Some dark line surfaced on Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead. He licked his lips and softly said, \u201cTeacher. I feel that it seems\u2026 to not have any killing intent. Why don\u2019t you try removing the \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 alright. Be careful.\u201d Hearing the suggestion, Yao Lao hesitated before nodding his head.</p><br/><p>As Yao Lao\u2019s words fell, the thick white flame on Xiao Yan\u2019s body was swiftly extinguished. Once the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 completely disappeared, Xiao Yan clenched his perspiration filled fist and stared at the seven-colored small snake in front of him. He carefully said, \u201cYour Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>The small snake did not make the slightest response to Xiao Yan\u2019s cry. It simply blinked its quartz like pupils, swayed its snake tail and gradually swam over to Xiao Yan while suspended in the air.</p><br/><p>Seeing its action, Xiao Yan could only remain on the spot quietly while his heart felt jittery.</p><br/><p>The seven-colored snake circled around Xiao Yan twice but did not display any intentions of ill will. This let Xiao Yan heave a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>After swaying its tail and whirled around Xiao Yan one more time, the seven-colored small snake suddenly stopped in the space above Xiao Yan\u2019s hand. Its crystal clear eyes carried some yearning as it stared intently at the storage ring on Xiao Yan\u2019s hand. It then raised its head and emitted a few soft hiss toward Xiao Yan. The gentle sound was as though it was behaving like a spoiled child.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

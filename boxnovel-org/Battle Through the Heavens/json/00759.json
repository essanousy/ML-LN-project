Such a tall mountain range was a place that an ordinary person would have difficulty climbing. An incomparably huge fortress guarded the gap between these two mountain ranges like a fierce prehistoric beast, protecting the main road that lead into and out of the Jia Ma Empire. This fortress was the most important defensive line in the hearts of the people of the Jia Ma Empire. If this defensive line was torn apart, the three empires armies would march straight into the Jia Ma Empire!</p><br/><p>The size of the fortress was so large that it left one speechless. Compared to the Zhen Gui Pass that Xiao Yan had visited back then, it was undoubtedly a junior meeting a senior. The walls of this fortress was completely built from the dark-black volcanic rock. It had an unusually frightening toughness. Such a wall would likely be able to hold out for a long time even against the attacks of an elite Dou Huang.</p><br/><p>Densely packed soldiers could be seen all over the fortress\u2019 wall. There were also countless number of enormous ballistas faintly present. Steel arrows that were as thick as one\u2019s thigh had been loaded onto the ballistas and were ready to unleash a frightening strength at any moment. This defensive line was worthy of being as firm as metal under the protection of a countless number of soldiers. Even the three empire alliance would have to pay a hefty and bloody price in order to forcefully attack and tear this defensive line apart.</p><br/><p>Over ten human figures with quite a great reputation within the empire stood on the middle of the city wall. At this moment, their gazes carried a thread of worry as they looked at an extremely far spot from the fortress. Densely packed armies rolled out like dark clouds from that spot. At a glance, one could see an endless number of them. From the looks of the large flags that the armies carried, they were the alliance military from the three large empires.</p><br/><p>Of course, the thing that caused them the most worry was not these ordinary soldiers. Instead it was the three elite Dou Zongs who were hidden within the army. In the eyes of a truly strong person, an ordinary army did not pose much of a threat. As long as one was an expert Dou Wang, one would be able to easily defend against a ten thousand man strong army. This was also the reason why the strong possessed a position that exceeded that of royalty on this continent!</p><br/><p>The strong reigned supreme in the Dou Qi continent. Royal authority was second!</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, I heard that the ones who have led everyone over this time around are Yan Luo Tian and the three Elders from the Mulan Valley\u2026 although the most troublesome Sect Leader of the Poison Sect will not appear, this is already enough to feel an extremely great pressure. After all, this is equivalent to two elite Dou Zongs.\u201d Hai Bodong\u2019s gaze stared into the distance for a moment before withdrawing it and sighing.</p><br/><p>The current Hai Bodong had truly reached the peak of the Dou Huang class where he was comparable to Jia Lao after the repeated big fights during the past year. Breaking through to the Dou Zong class was only one step away. Of course, the distance of this one step was such that it was an ordinary thing for one to be unable to cross in one\u2019s lifetime if one did not have the opportunity. After all, there were an unknown number of people on the Dou Qi continent who had ended up stopping at this stage.</p><br/><p>Despite this, a Dou Huang was ultimately a Dou Huang. Unless one possessed some unusual abnormal Dou Skills, it was basically impossible to leap across the class and challenge an elite Dou Zong. After all, not everyone was like Xiao Yan. He not only possessed the mysterious \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 Qi Method but also unique treasures like three \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 and the \u2018God Seal Skill\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already dispatched some people to the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 to search for Second Brother. He will definitely come and lend a hand if he receives the news. However\u2026 a distant water source cannot quench one\u2019s immediate thirst. It is likely going to be a different situation by the time he leads people over.\u201d Xiao Ding, who was seated on a wheelchair, softly sighed. During this period of time, he had spent a great amount of effort and thought in order to deal with the attacks of the three sects. However, the other party had people who were equivalent to three elite Dou Zongs. This was ultimately a huge weight that was pressing on the hearts of everyone in the Jia Ma Empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, are your injuries alright?\u201d Xiao Ding\u2019s hand patted gently on his wheelchair before he turned his head to look at the cold pretty face of the bewitching lady beside him. Her moving appearance was indeed a rare beauty in this kind of place that was filled with blood and killing.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was due to Xiao Ding\u2019s relationship with someone but the coldness on Medusa\u2019s bewitching face, which was staring into the distance with cold eyes, slowly became warmer. She said, \u201cI have consumed the medicinal pill that the Yan Alliance alchemists have refined and recovered quite a bit. Although my fighting strength is slightly weakened, there are no serious problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ding laughed bitterly and nodded slightly. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s been tough on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also thinking of the Snake-People Race. Now that everyone\u2019s relationship is one where the death of anyone will cause the other to suffer, the losses from any single side will result in a destructive end.\u201d Medusa shook her head. She turned her head slightly as her eyes looked toward the distant Magical Beast Mountain Range. She clenched her silver teeth and sighed within her heart, \u201cHave you not come out of your retreat? If you are a little later, it is likely that the Jia Ma Empire will really be destroyed\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, I wonder how third brother doing. His retreat actually took an entire year. It is best that no accident has happened to him\u2026.\u201d Xiao Ding also understood what Medusa was thinking when he saw her gaze. He rubbed his forehead and bitterly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little bastard always plays it like this\u2026 if he does not return soon, this Yan Alliance will be finished.\u201d Hai Bodong by his side could not resist opening his mouth to speak when he heard Xiao Ding\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it should be soon. As long as we are able to endure until he comes out from his retreat, the situation will be much better. After all, that fellow may be a Dou Huang but if he unleashes his full strength, he is able to contend against an elite Dou Zong. At that time, our side will have two elite Dou Zongs. Even the people from the three sects would not dare to act rashly. If we were to really go into an all out fight, this Queen would at the very least be able to drag one of them down even if I end up dying!\u201d Medusa voiced her thoughts. A dense chill immediately flashed across her pupils.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Sect Leader of the Poison Sect, Yan Luo Tian from the Gold Geese Sect, and the three Elders from the Mulan Valley are afraid that you will do this. Hence, they have not been engaging in a deathmatch with you. However, this time, it is likely that they have made preparations when they join hands. Your Majesty, you should be more careful.\u201d Jia Xing Tian by the other side spoke in a deep voice while wearing a respectful expression.</p><br/><p>Medusa nodded slightly. She was about to speak when a thunder-like drumbeat began to spread over from far away in a mighty manner. It immediately affected the entire fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are about to begin their attack!\u201d The expressions of Medusa and the others were tense as they heard this hurried drumbeat.</p><br/><p>The ground began to tremble not long after the drumbeat sounded. The enormous endless sea of people in the distance began to rush over toward the fortress like ocean waves. The orderly bang as their feet landed on the ground resounded over this place like a thunderous roar, giving people a heavy feeling within their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the experts Dou Wangs from the Yan Alliance and the Snake-People Race, spread yourself all over the defensive lines. Tightly guard against the enemy\u2019s expert Dou Wangs!\u201d Xiao Ding\u2019s expression gradually became solemn as he turned his head and spoke in a stern manner.</p><br/><p>A large number of people responded behind him upon hearing the order. Immediately, numerous human figures flew out in a lightning-like manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, today\u2019s big battle affects the survival of our Jia Ma Empire and the Snake-People Race. Therefore, let\u2019s go all out!\u201d Xiao Ding\u2019s gaze slowly swept over everyone as he spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Everyone nodded their heads heavily with a solemn expression when they heard his words. This battle concerned their survival!</p><br/><p>While the fortress entered into a battle ready mode, the black masses of human heads began to flood over amid the loud battle cries that soared to the sky. Numerous rays of light flew through the air above this sea of people. These were the experts from the three sects, the figures who caused the pressure on the Black Mountain Fortress to soar.</p><br/><p>When the endless black masses of human flow were still around a thousand meters from the fortress, a killing aura surged to the sky with a loud stomping sound. It spread out before covering the entire Black Mountain Fortress into it!</p><br/><p>The rays of light flew across in the sky while numerous people with Dou Qi wings on their backs appeared. Their gazes carried cold smiles as they observed the tightly guarded Black Mountain Fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, it is really unexpected that your Jia Ma Empire is so stubborn. You are actually able to endure for nearly a year in the face of our three empire alliance. Even though your Jia Ma Empire will be completely defeated in this battle, your Jia Ma Empire\u2019s reputation could be considered to have soared in this northwestern region.\u201d A powerful wild laugh suddenly sounded while the armies faced each other. Finally, it resounded over the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan Luo Tian!\u201d The face of Medusa and the others in the fortress immediately turned cold upon hearing the laughter. Their mouths spat out a name that was incomparably prestigious within the Luo Yan Empire.</p><br/><p>A bright golden glow suddenly shot into the sky from the large army after the laughter sounded. It immediately stayed suspended in the sky. Everyone\u2019s eyes drifted over, only to see a man who was wearing golden clothes floating in the sky. A pair of unusually large gold-colored goose wings flickered, appearing much like a divine being.</p><br/><p>The black masses of soldiers immediately erupted into an earth-shaking cheer when this gold-clothed man appeared. Clearly, this Yan Luo Tian possessed an extremely high reputation among them.</p><br/><p>Medusa\u2019s face was icy-cold as she looked at Yan Luo Tian. Her body moved and she was already in the sky outside of the fortress the next time she appeared. Her gaze swept over Yan Luo Tian only to laugh, \u201cA mere two star Dou Zong also dares to act presumptuous in front of this Queen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, Medusa\u2019s beauty has been spread among a number of countries around. You really live up to your reputation. This ancestor (refer to himself as a Dou Zong) knows that I alone will be no match for you. Hence, I am naturally not intending to fight alone\u2026\u201d A cold smile surfaced on the corner of Yan Luo Tian\u2019s mouth as he slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, you are indeed worthy of being Queen Medusa. You are really a hero among women. Today, allow the three of us and the Geese Sect\u2019s Leader to exchange blows with you\u2026\u201d Three different rays of light shot out from the army below just after Yan Luo Tian\u2019s voice sounded. Finally, three smiling Elders appeared in the air.</p><br/><p>Medusa\u2019s eyes shrank slightly as she looked at the three old men. Her face was icy as she emphasized every word with a pause.</p><br/><p>\u201cMulan. Three. Elders.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

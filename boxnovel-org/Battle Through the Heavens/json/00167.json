Their faces were filled with astonishment as they blankly stared at the young man by the stone table.</p><br/><p>Within the hall, everyone\u2019s gazes were foolishly staring at the young man. If Xiao Yan\u2019s success in passing a tier one alchemist test just a moment ago caused them to feel amazement in their hearts, then this next question actually caused everyone to feel stunned.</p><br/><p>A nineteen year old tier one alchemist was uncommon but there were still many in the Jia Ma Empire. However, a nineteen year old tier two alchemist was truly rare. It should be known that even the Pill King Gu He within the Jia Ma Empire had only just become a tier one alchemist at this age.</p><br/><p>If Xiao Yan managed to pass the test for the tier two alchemist today, would it not mean that his achievements in the future would be even greater than Pill King Gu He.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh god\u2026 we might be witnessing a monster rising from the Alchemist Association at Black Rock City.\u201d Everyone in the large hall exchanged glances with one another and immediately said with a soft, bitter laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 should not underestimate the requirements for the test for a tier two alchemist. If you want to pass the test for a tier two alchemist, you must not only refine a tier two medicinal pill, but your strength must also reach the Dou Shi level. Dou Shi! Have you achieved it?\u201d Tilting her head, Lin Fei eyed the smiling face of the young man and could not help but knit her eyebrows together as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDou Shi\u2026\u201d Smiling gently, Xiao Yan watched Lin Fei\u2019s beautiful and moving face and laughed, \u201c I only want to try. Whether I pass or not doesn\u2019t make much of a difference.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really wish to take another test, this one being the tier two alchemist test?\u201d Looking at Xiao Yan who did not display any expression of giving up after hearing Lin Fei\u2019s words, Frank and Ao Tuo exchanged glances before asking seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere should not be any problems, is there?\u201d Xiao Yan rubbed his head as he asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow confident are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ao Tuo\u2019s expression was slightly serious at the moment. If the young man in front of him really passed the tier two alchemist test, then he was someone with incredible talent. In the future, this person might be a new star in the alchemist scene for Jia Ma Empire who is more overbearing than the Pill King Gu He! For the alchemist scene in the empire, this was undoubtedly great news that would cause an uproar.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 around fifty percent.\u201d Xiao Yan tightly closed his lips and analysed his success rate for refining a tier two medicinal pill before reporting a number. Since he was afraid of appearing too confident, Xiao Yan reported a somewhat conservative number.</p><br/><p>The number may have been considered conservative in Xiao Yan\u2019s hear, but after he reported it, Ao Tuo and Frank trembled slightly. Some of the expressions on the other people\u2019s faces also changed.</p><br/><p>There was quite a significant rate of failure when refining a tier two medicinal pill. Even some of the alchemists present did not dare guarantee that they would be able to achieve 50 percent success rate when refining a tier two medicinal pill! However, the young man in front of them actually wore a smile on his face as he said these words. Instantly, the few tier two alchemists in the hall began to call into question this figure in their hearts. Evidently, they did not quite believe what Xiao Yan had said even if he did own a strange type of flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifty percent\u2026\u201d After mumbling in her heart, Xue Mei tilted her head and stared at the tall figure of the young man by the stone table. In her heart, she involuntarily whispered, \u201cIsn\u2019t this guy a little arrogant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo? Can I continue taking the test? If it is really not possible, then forget it. After all, I am only making a temporary stop at Black Rock City. If I have the chance, I will go test somewhere else when I have time.\u201d Seeing that Frank and Ao Tuo did not reply, Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words, Frank quickly spoke. What a joke. This was an insane opportunity for the Alchemist Association in Black Rock City to show face among those of the same occupation. Thus, he would not allow Xiao Yan to run to other cities to take the test. If that were the case, it would be like giving the opportunity to others for no reason!</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone, immediately prepare the tier two alchemist test!\u201d When Frank exchanged another glance with Ao Tuo, the two of them found excitement in each other\u2019s eyes. After which, he waved his hand and gave the order.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, a few alchemists behind him hurriedly moved and swiftly walked toward a side door in the hall. On the side door were the words \u2018Tier Two Alchemist Test Venue\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I will let you take the test. Little boy, you better not be deceiving us two old men.\u201d Frank clapped his hands as he turned around and said with a laugh to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will do my best\u2026 Oh yes, I heard that registering with the Alchemist Association after the test will let one receive some special privileges from the Association?\u201d Xiao Yan walked from the stone table and asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, correct. When an alchemist refines medicinal pills, they usually require some extremely unique and rare plants. A person, however, cannot run all over the place to gather all these things. Hence, after you have registered at our Jia Ma Empire Alchemist Association, you will be able to enjoy the right of exchanges\u2026 For example, when you are refining a certain medicinal pill and you lack one of the medicinal ingredients which another alchemist happens to possess, under the consensus of both parties, our association will help you complete this transaction. Of course, the prerequisite is that you must be able to take out something that the other party is satisfied with to complete the transaction.\u201d Frank nodded his head as he said with a smile, \u201cNaturally, if your tier is higher, you would be able to enjoy even more rights. Thus, in order to exchange something which you need from others without many obstructions, you will need to work hard to raise your tier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is something good\u2026\u201d A little bit of joy appeared on Xiao Yan\u2019s face as he nodded his head. This measure taken by the Alchemist Association would undoubtedly save the time required by an Alchemist to roam around to find ingredients. Moreover, it just so happened that Xiao Yan lacked some things right now. After he passed the test, he would definitely get Frank to help him check. If someone else really had the ingredients he needed, he would put in the utmost effort to exchange for them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, the preparations for the test for a tier two Alchemist have been completed. Follow me.\u201d Tilting his head, Frank watched the few alchemists taking turns to exit the small room. After he saw them nod their heads, he then spoke the words with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded and subsequently followed Frank into that small room. Ao Tuo, who was behind him, also followed closely. When he was about to enter the door, he turned around and he said with a smile said to everyone outside who were extending their necks, \u201cThe examination for a tier two alchemist is different from a tier one alchemist. Thus, all of you cannot just carelessly enter. Just wait outside. There will soon be an answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026 please let me go in and take a look.\u201d Hearing Ao Tuo\u2019s words, Lin Fei\u2019s face became anxious as she rushed forward and tugged on Ao Tuo\u2019s sleeve while speaking like a spoiled child.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis has always been the rule of the Alchemist Association. Even I cannot do anything about it. You should just wait outside.\u201d Helplessly shaking his head, Ao Tuo gently shook his sleeves, shaking Lin Fei off and forcing her to take a small step backwards. After that, he quickly went behind the door and closed it tightly with a loud slamming noise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. What\u2019s the big deal. If you don\u2019t let me take a look, then so be it.\u201d Eyeing the door that was tightly shut, Lin Fei snorted arrogantly and mumbled with dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>Turning around, Lin Fei looked at the pretty and impassive face of Xue Mei and approached her. After which, she softly whispered beside the latter, \u201cDo you think the guy will succeed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I know? Didn\u2019t he say earlier that he is fifty percent confident? That seemed to be quite good.\u201d Xue Mei said indifferently after glancing at Lin Fei beside her.</p><br/><p>Lin Fei curled her lips as her pretty figure jumped to sit on top of the stone table. Her long legs that were revealed under the purple-colored dress created a mesmerising snow-white angle, causing the gazes of some of the men in the hall to be unable to resist the temptation and glance over.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, I thought that it was already very impressive for us to be able to become a tier one alchemist within two years. Unexpectedly, this abnormal guy suddenly appeared. It is still alright that he is a little younger than us but he actually possesses the qualification to take the test for a tier two alchemist. Isn\u2019t this too much of a blow to others?\u201d Tilting her head, Lin Fei faced her rival for a number of years and helplessly said.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, a different undertone surfaced on Xue Mei pale expression. She sighed quietly and whispered, \u201cIt is indeed quite a blow to others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, didn\u2019t you say that no one among the younger generation in Black Rock City could surpass you? Now that someone has appeared, I recall that you said back then, It was something like accompanying\u2026\u201d Lin Fei\u2019s crow-black eyes rotated as she suddenly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry but he isn\u2019t someone from Black Rock City.\u201d A faint crimson color surfaced on Xiao Mei\u2019s pretty face as a cunningness flashed across her pretty eyes before she told Lin Fei with a sweet smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou win\u2026\u201d Lin Fei softly snorted as she combed through the black hair on her forehead as she laughed, \u201cBut with that guy\u2019s talent, you would not lose out. Although your teacher is one of the key figures in Black Rock City, you should also know that to be able to teach such an abnormal student, just think how strong his teacher must be.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot interested. If you like him, take him for yourself. Isn\u2019t Grandmaster Ao Tuo\u2019s reputation as an alchemist on par with my teacher? Moreover, your father is also the governor of Black Rock City.\u201d Xue Mei smiled and said. Her indifferent tone, however, caused Lin Fei beside her to clench her teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cChe\u2026 the people who are chasing me can form a queue up to fifteen kilometers outside the city. I don\u2019t have the leisure to throw myself at him.\u201d Lin Fei prettily rolled her eyes as she laughed in a spoilt voice.</p><br/><p>The faint laughter caused Xue Mei to raise her eyebrow. Her gaze turned toward the door and her fist secretly tightened. She whispered, \u201cThey\u2019re coming out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe examination has already ended?\u201d Hearing this, Lin Fei\u2019s mind was shaken as she hurriedly turned her gaze toward the door.</p><br/><p>Following a crunching sound from the door, it was gradually pulled open. Frank and Ao Tuo were first to exit. The exchanged a glance with each other before sighing softly and shaking their heads.</p><br/><p>Seeing their actions, Lin Fei and Xue Mei frowned. Did he fail?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis young boy\u2019s talent in refining medicine is really frighteningly outstanding. Ugh\u2026 it\u2019s not possible not to be impressed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lifting his head, Frank waved his hand and smiled. \u201cLooks like our Black Rock City Alchemist Association has given rise to the youngest tier two alchemist in a hundred years\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

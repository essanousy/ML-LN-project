Regardless of whether he was Wang Chen\u2019s match, just the boldness of stepping forward and facing his challenge head-on caused many people to let out quiet praises.</p><br/><p>A dense smile flashed across Huang Quan zun-zhe\u2019s withered-tree-like face while he sat in the VIP seats. Although the brat in front of him was a little strange, he also possessed confidence in Wang Chen. His actual strength had already reached the level of half a step into the Dou Zong class after having soaked in the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. As long as he was given sufficient time, his entry into the Dou Zong class was a given. Moreover, Wang Chen was also able to fight with an ordinary Dou Zong if he went all out. There was even less need to mention the current situation\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLei zun-zhe, what do you say to me occupying a little of the competition\u2019s time?\u201d Huang Quan zun-zhe looked at Lei zun-zhe as he faintly laughed.</p><br/><p>Lei zun-zhe smiled when he heard this, but did not reject him. Although Xiao Yan seemed a little strange, he was clearly far inferior to Huang Quan zun-zhe in his heart. It was only natural that Lei zun-zhe had to give him some time and face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHopefully it will not drag out for too long\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Quan zun-zhe smiled. His gaze turned to Wang Chen in the arena as he faintly said, \u201cThis matter was caused by you, so you should resolve this matter. You should know of the consequences if you fail to resolve it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chen\u2019s hands, which were holding the dark-black daggers, trembled slightly upon hearing the words of Huang Quan zun-zhe. He bowed his body slightly to him as a savage smile surged onto his face, \u201cTeacher, please rest assured that this disciple shall let this person, who has humiliated our Yellow Spring Pavilion, pay the price.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Quan zun-zhe slowly leaned against the backrest and gently nodded.</p><br/><p>Jian zun-zhe and Feng zun-zhe by the side knit their brows slightly when they saw this. Their gazes looked at Xiao Yan in the arena with strange expressions. However, they did not say anything. If they were to continue placing obstructions, it was likely that this old fellow Huang Quan would explode today\u2026</p><br/><p>The competitors present automatically withdrew to the side when they heard Lei zun-zhe\u2019s words. Their eyes immediately stared at Xiao Yan in the arena. This fellow dared to accept Wang Chen\u2019s challenge. They did not know whether he was crazy or if he possessed some confidence...</p><br/><p>Feng Qing Er\u2019s eyebrows were vertical as she studied Xiao Yan\u2019s figure. Her hands parted a thread of black hair in front of her forehead as doubt flashed across her pretty eyes.</p><br/><p>The progress of the competition also came to a halt as a result. However, the atmosphere on the mountain top did not become chaotic. The many cheering cries had instead caused the atmosphere to become even more heated. Many people wanted to know whether Xiao Yan would be able to endure under Wang Chen\u2019s hands\u2026 of course, this did not exclude their attitude of wanting to hear some other unbelievable scene.</p><br/><p>Lin Yan anxiously rubbed his hands together as he watched Xiao Yan, who was slowly walking into the arena. His heart felt a little regretful. He could vaguely sense that Xiao Yan\u2019s aura was far stronger than him. However, Wang Chen was someone at the peak of the Dou Huang class. Moreover, it was rumored that this fellow had a strength that could fight against an elite Dou Zong. The thing that caused him to be most worried about was that Wang Chen was a vicious person. Each time he fought with someone, the other party would definitely be crippled even if he did not die\u2026 Xiao Yan would likely be in a dangerous position when fighting with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, if this fellow dares to hurt Xiao Yan, the old me will not let him off easily even if I have to risk this life of mine.\u201d Lin Yan viciously clenched his teeth. A fierce glint also flashed across his eyes. He was a person who greatly valued friendship, and he had a deep relationship with Xiao Yan. If anything were to happen to him, he would definitely not just sit idly by the side.</p><br/><p>Wang Chen looked at Xiao Yan, who was slowly walking over, with a pair of dark eyes. Xiao Yan finally stopped not far in front of him. The daggers in Wang Chen\u2019s hands were swiftly rotated before he clenched their hilts. The daggers obediently paused in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you admit defeat now and kowtow three times, I can allow you to get lost from Lightning Mountain.\u201d Wang Chen glanced at Xiao Yan and laughed in a dense voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan merely smiled in the face of the sinister Wang Chen. He clenched his fist and Dou Qi immediately surged of his body. It swiftly gathered in his palm and a jade-green energy ruler was formed. The Heavy Xuan Ruler was overly conspicuous. If he were to take it out here, he would be immediately recognized. On the other hand, this large ruler formed by energy appeared blurry, and it also looked like a broadsword.</p><br/><p>The sinister smile on Wang Chen\u2019s face involuntarily became denser when he saw that Xiao Yan had ignored his words. The killing intent within his eyes swiftly rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, I will let you regret offending the Yellow Spring Pavilion!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sinister voice had just sounded when Wang Chen\u2019s body trembled. He transformed into a black rainbow. Within a breath\u2019s time, he had appeared behind Xiao Yan\u2019s back. The daggers in his hands moved in a lightning-like manner. They pierced ay two fatal spots, the neck and the back of his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cClang! Clang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chen might be fast, but the daggers had yet to land on Xiao Yan\u2019s body when the jade-green energy ruler emitted a \u2018shua\u2019 sound. It appeared behind his back. After which, he easily blocked the dagger attack.</p><br/><p>Wang Chen\u2019s face did not display any changes after his first attack proved futile. Black-colored Dou Qi, that contained a dense chillness, lingered over his dagger like poisonous snakes. They transformed into two enormous black pythons that bypassed the large energy ruler and violently pierced toward Xiao Yan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The large energy python had just charged out when a fist made of wind, carrying a deep sonic boom, landed on them, shattering them in the process.</p><br/><p>After shattering the large energy pythons, the energy ruler in Xiao Yan\u2019s hand emitted a \u2018shua\u2019 sound. It carried a sonic boom as it was violently fanned. The powerful wind forced Wang Chen back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are only so-so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face revealed a smile as he supported the heavy ruler on his shoulders. However, his calm voice only caused Wang Chen\u2019s eyes to become fiercer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is only a warm up. There is no need to speak so arrogantly!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chen\u2019s bright-red tongue licked a dagger. Dark-black ink-like Dou Qi surged out of his body as though an enormous ink pillar had shot toward the sky. The strength of this Dou Qi exceeded that of an ordinary person at the peak of the Dou Huang class!</p><br/><p>At this moment, just the aura of Wang Chen could already be considered a quasi-elite Dou Zong. Although there was still an enormous gap to a genuine elite Dou Zong, it was ultimately much stronger than some experts at the peak of the Dou Huang class.</p><br/><p>Numerous exclamations were emitted from outside the arena as they sensed Wang Chen\u2019s powerful aura, some contained envy. The current Wang Chen had already taken half a step into the Dou Zong class. Half of the enormous gap between the Dou Huang and Dou Zong was already crossed by Wang Chen. The remaining half was only a matter of time\u2026</p><br/><p>The faces of Feng Qing Er, Mu Qing Luan, and Tang Ying in the arena did not reveal any surprise. All of them had soaked in the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. and knew that they had gained a great deal of benefits from it. It was within expectations that this Wang Chen had also taken half a step into the Dou Zong class.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuasi Dou Zong huh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan muttered. He narrowed his eyes as his gaze looked at the powerful Dou Qi that lingered around Wang Chen like a whirlwind. When he had exchanged blows with this person in the Heaven Eye Mountain Range, he had clearly been at the peak of the Dou Huang class. It was likely that the help of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool had allowed him to gain such a breakthrough.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe current you has already lost your final chance to show regret\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chen\u2019s face was covered with a ferocity. It appeared to be faintly distorted, causing it to appear extremely terrifying.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan frowned. This person was indeed somewhat troublesome to deal with. If this continued, there was no telling just how long he would be entangled. Moreover, someone might see through something during this period of time. Hence, it was best that he ended this battle as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Just as Xiao Yan had made up his mind, Wang Chen, whose aura had already reached the peak, revealed an even more savage smile on his face. His body moved and the intense corrosive strength on the surface of his body caused a long gully to appear in the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cBone Corroding Round Dagger Dance!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wang Chen\u2019s speed was also much faster compared to before. In a flash, he appeared in front of Xioa Yan. The two daggers in his hands transformed into countless number of black glows that even caused numerous scars to appear in the air. The angle of the daggers\u2019 dance was extremely strange. They had basically permeated all around Xiao Yan. Those black glows even contained waves of chillness that drilled into his heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes coagulated. This Wang Chen was definitely using a kind of high class Dou Skill. Moreover, it was likely that its level was quite high\u2026 this Yellow Spring Pavilion really lived up to its reputation of being one of the four pavilions that coexisted.</p><br/><p>\u201cSix-Joint Body Flowing Ruler!\u201d</p><br/><p>The heavy ruler in Xiao Yan\u2019s hand also moved as his heart desired at this moment, swiftly forming numerous ruler shadows. It formed a dense ruler web that completely wrapped around Xiao Yan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Clang clang clang clang clang clang!</p><br/><p>The black glow that came from all directions poured into the ruler\u2019s web as a clear sound continued to erupt. Each time a clear sound appeared, an enormous energy ripple would swiftly surge out, forming numerous spider web like cracks on the hard silver wood arena.</p><br/><p>Exclamations were immediately emitted from all around as everyone watched the dazzling exchange in the battleground. No one expected that Xiao Yan would be able to fight evenly with Wang Chen when he had unleashed his Dou Qi to its peak.</p><br/><p>At this moment, anyone, regardless of how foolish they were, could tell that Xiao Yan\u2019s choice of agreeing to the fight was not some reckless act. Instead, he truly possessed the ability and qualification to fight with the other party.</p><br/><p>In the VIP seats, the smile on Huang Quan zun-zhe\u2019s face was reduced. In the end, it had completely transformed into a gloomy expression. From his senses, Xiao Yan\u2019s strength was continuously climbing. Within a short breath\u2019s time, it had approached Wang Chen. Moreover, it was still climbing!</p><br/><p>Feng zun-zhe, Lei zun-zhe, Jian zun-zhe, and the others gradually revealed surprise on their faces. All of them immediately fell deep into thought. This person had indeed hid his actual strength. If this was the case, it seemed the one in trouble was going to be\u2014Wang Chen?</p><br/><p>A slight arc involuntarily curled on the faces of Feng zun-zhe and Jian zun-zhe when they thought of this.</p><br/><p>While these two were gloating, unexpected changes continued to appear in the arena. One could see the ruler shadows, that had been wrapping around Xiao Yan\u2019s body, suddenly disappearing. A powerful aura that was far stronger than that of Wang Chen immediately appeared just like a mountain peak that rose from the plains, surging to the sky as it did so!</p><br/><p>The majestic Dou Qi easily broke through the blade web formed by Wang Chen\u2019s dagger. With a flash of the ruler, an unusual flame swiftly gathered at the tip of the ruler!</p><br/><p>\u201cSix Joint Body Flowing Ruler, Six Joint Fire!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

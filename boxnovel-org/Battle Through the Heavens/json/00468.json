He was unable to resist letting out a long breath. For some unknown reason, he constantly felt that this black tower was not that simple\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHu, it is really unexpected\u2026 it actually agglomerated a \u2018Fire Spirit\u2019 with emotions and intelligence. Tsk tsk. No wonder the Inner Academy is so strict. They even created a \u2018Space Lock,\u2019 which even an elite Dou Zun would have to use all his might in order to cast\u2026\u201d Just as Xiao Yan was sighing, Yao Lao\u2019s surprised voice suddenly sounded in his heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was slightly startled when he heard Yao Lao\u2019s words. His expression did not change as he looked all around him. After which, he waved his hand toward Wu Hao, who still appeared slightly giddy. After which, he turned his body and walked on the path which they had used to travel here earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the \u2018Fire Spirit\u2019 that teacher just mentioned?\u201d Xiao Yan walked at a steady pace, that was neither fast nor slow, along this road lined with trees. Only then did he inquire about this in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn alternate life form that is created from pure flames\u2026 that invisible flame serpent that you saw earlier should be the intelligence that was created from within the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame.\u2019 It can even be said that the fire python is the original body of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 within this \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower!\u2019\u201d Yao Lao slowly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? That fire python is the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame?\u2019\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s footsteps suddenly paused. His expression involuntarily changed a little as he could not help but let out a startled cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I should not have sensed wrongly\u2026 Those strange flames between the Heavens and Earth would grow into various different unique forms after being accumulated over time. An example is the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 which you met in the lava underground. That plant form that is similar to a lotus is only formed after the core flame has undergone thousands of years of suppression\u2026\u201d Yao Lao said in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 which we found last time may possess a plant form but it had not formed an emotion or intelligence that belonged to it. However, earlier\u2026 I truly felt that fire python. This kind of flame body, which possesses intelligence that belongs to itself, is what we call a \u2018Fire Spirit.\u2019 Its intelligence should be comparable with some ultimate Magical Beasts that can possess a human form.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 how do we refine this kind of \u2018Fire Spirit\u2019 even if we obtain it? Earlier, I also sensed the frightening aura of that thing. I\u2019m afraid that even a strong Dou Huang might not be its match. How can we swallow it?\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s words caused Xiao Yan to feel shocked. He did not expect that even a flame was able to form its own consciousness. However, now that this flame already had its own consciousness, it would definitely not be willing to be swallowed and refined by other people. Seeing the frightening aura that it displayed earlier, Xiao Yan immediately became dispirited.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed very difficult\u2026 however there is no other choice. Of course, it does not matter if you are willing to give up this \u2018Fallen Heart Flame,\u2019 and go and search for other \u2018Heavenly Flames.\u2019\u201d Yao Lao laughed faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat joke are you cracking\u2026 are \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 so easy to find?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan immediately cried out within his heart when he heard this. After spending a couple of years, he had obtained the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 by relying solely on luck. Now that he had found the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 after much difficulty, how would he be willing to give it up?</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case we can only wait and see\u2026 actually let\u2019s not mention how we are going to handle it after we get the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame.\u2019 Just how do we obtain it is already filled with numerous problems.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s voice contained a tone as if he had a headache, \u201cThe strong people in this Inner Academy are as numerous as the clouds. In the tower earlier, I could vaguely sense that there exists extremely faint but powerful auras a few levels below. The strength of these auras is such that in my current spiritual form, it is impossible for me to gain much advantage when fighting with them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s knit his brows as his ten fingers were tightly hooked together.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, at this moment, I can confirm that the reason the Inner Academy is able to increase the training speed of the students is basically due to the existence of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019... They sealed the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame,\u2019 which had formed a spirit, into the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,\u2019 borrowing its effect of letting the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 form a split body at the invocation of a person\u2019s heart when he is close to it. This allows the students to use it to strengthen their Qi Paths and refine Dou Qi...</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2026 are\u2026 rearing the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame!\u2019\u201d Yao Lao slowly exhaled a breath of cool air as he faintly exclaimed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s hands, which were held together, abruptly trembled. He wiped the cold sweat on his forehead without leaving a trace. In his heart, he continued to feel shock at these crazy and bold actions of the Inner Academy. These fellows were really too frightening. They actually had the courage to try to tame a thing that had the greatest destructive forces between the Heavens and Earth.</p><br/><p>Only after Yao Lao\u2019s explanation did Xiao Yan understand that the Inner Academy had reared the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 like one would rear a dairy cow. After which, they repeatedly obtained an unending amount of \u2018milk\u2019 from it; the split bodies of \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019... this kind of action could indeed be called insane.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn expert is indeed bold. This Inner Academy is really frightening\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan swallowed a mouthful of saliva and muttered in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, bold? I think they are playing with fire and will end up getting burned.\u201d Yao Lao coldly snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? From what I saw, there seems to be no problem?\u201d Xiao Yan said in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, currently, they are relying on the lock of the \u2018Space Cage\u2019, so there is indeed no problem. However, this is merely an expedient measure. By relying on that \u2018Space Cage,\u2019 it is impossible to continue keeping the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 sealed within the tower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao laughed, \u201cA fire can be scattered, but cannot be blocked. This \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 is a unique flame that is formed from the Heavens and the Earth. It possesses true destructive strength\u2026 by sealing and blocking it in this manner, it is like the Inner Academy is building a barrier on the mouth of a volcano. Have you seen anyone who can block a volcano? Its current oppressed manner is merely because it is storing strength. At the time when it erupts, this \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 will immediately be destroyed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 is frightening, those old fellows from the Inner Academy are also not some useless lot. Before the eruption, one will charge and one will block. Both parties will have some losses. At that time, it might perhaps be our chance\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, you mean that we should wait for the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 to erupt by itself?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled as he said in a stunned manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we can only do this. We are small in number and weak in strength. There is no use if we openly do it\u2026\u201d Yao Lao nodded and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen when do we need to wait until?\u201d Xiao Yan rolled his eyes and laughed bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on the counterattack of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 earlier, there might be a turn of events soon. At the very most, it will take two years and at the very least it will take one.\u201d Yao Lao mused for a long while before he lowered his voice as he revealed information softly in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s pupils swiftly flashed. A long while later, he carefully watched his surroundings. Other than Wu Hao, who was repeatedly knocked his giddy head, there was no other movement. The words Yao Lao had spoken concerned the matter of the life and death of the Inner Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the days that follow, you must make the most of the time and train in the tower. It would be best if you can raise your strength to the Dou Ling class in half a year\u2019s time. At that time, with the inclusion of the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 and the \u2018Flame Splitting Tsunami,\u2019 I think that you can run wild without fear within the Dou Ling class. If you use the \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 that is formed from the combination of the Purple and the Green Flame, it is likely that even the Elder Su, from outside the forest back then, would not have the courage to receive it head on with one hand\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt would be best that you try your best not to use the large-scale \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 that combines the \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 and the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame.\u2019 That thing may have a frightening strength, but its backlash is simply too great. At times, you will lose more than what you gain.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdditionally, you should go and begin practicing that Di class Agility Dou Technique, \u2018Three Thousand Lightning Movement.\u2019 As long as you successfully practice that thing, you should be able to be in an unshakable position when you face ordinary Dou Lings. Even if you meet a strong Dou Wang, you should have the ability to flee even if you are unable to beat him. We must now agglomerate our strength in preperation for the eruption of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s voice was like shooting a bullet. His great amount of words caused Xiao Yan to continue smiling bitterly. It was only a long while later before he completely disgested those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that there are still the various ingredients for the \u2018Ground Spirit Pill\u2019 right?\u201d After slowly swallowing all of the various reminders from Yao Lao, Xiao Yan mused for a moment only to realize that there was something that Yao Lao missed. Immediately, he spoke with a smile. This thing was also a necessary item. Otherwise, even if he were to obtain the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 in the future, it was likely that he would not dare to touch it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 indeed. However, those ingredients are all extremely rare items. You need to pay careful attention.\u201d Yao Lao was startled before he immediately nodded and responded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed bitterly and nodded. He raised his head and eyed the blue sky before he involuntarily exhaled. Were there not so many troublesome matters...</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you sighing? Is it because of the problems of \u2018Pan Gate?\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice suddenly sounded behind him. Xiao Yan turned around and took a look. It was actually Wu Hao. The current him seemed to have recovered from his unconscious state after being grilled by the Heart Flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, it\u2019s nothing.\u201d Xiao Yan laughed softly before saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We should return and take a look first.\u201d Once he said that, he took the lead to quicken his footsteps, and flew through the road that he had come from earlier. Wu Hao followed close behind.</p><br/><p>After nearly forty to fifty minutes, Xiao Yan and Wu Hao gradually moved closer to the residence area of the new students. As he slowly walked into the residence area, the empty road caused the two of them to be startled.</p><br/><p>Just as the both of them were somewhat stunned, a human figure suddenly came running out from within the residence area while panting. When he saw Xiao Yan and Wu Hao, joy immediately swarmed onto his face. He rolled and crawled as he rushed over while shouting, \u201cHead, something happened!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Xiao Yan hurriedly moved forward and asked when he heard the loud cry of this new student.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is someone who wants to pull some new students away, but no one agreed in the end. As a result, those fellows wanted to create trouble. Now, they are forcing Senior Xun Er and Hu Jia to fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho has come?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s expression sunk. He hurriedly walked toward the interior. As he walked, he voiced his question.</p><br/><p>When he heard Xiao Yan\u2019s question, that new student involuntarily became a little hesitant. This scene caused Xiao Yan\u2019s footsteps to pause as he said in a deep voice, \u201cSpeak!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person leading them\u2026 is Bai Shan.\u201d The new student could only reply with a bitter smile after he was reprimanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis bastard repays kindness by stabbing people in the back!\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Xiao Yan and Wu Hao\u2019s expression instantly became dark.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

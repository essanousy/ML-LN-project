It immediately paused for a moment before it carried an unusually powerful pressure and energy fluctuation as it violently clashed against the energy longsword that shot over.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two extremely frightening attacks met in the sky an instant later. A thunder-like explosion suddenly resounded over the sky. Despite having been prepared for it, there were still quite a number of people whose ears rang for awhile. Even their vision had become a little blurry.</p><br/><p>Waves of substance-like energy ripples fluctuated wildly from the spot where the two fierce attacks collided. Even the space itself had become distorted under this frightening energy collision. From this, one could tell just how frightening the attacks the two people had unleashed were.</p><br/><p>The distorted space also enveloped the spots where Xiao Yan and Yun Shan stood. Hence, the many gazes that were looking at the sky did not know just who among these two people had obtained an advantage in this frightening energy collision.</p><br/><p>The energy ripple that spread through the air slowly faded away in front of the focus of a countless number of gazes a moment later. That distorted space had also gradually become clear.</p><br/><p>After the space recovered, the two figures on the distant sky appeared in front of everyone\u2019s sight. Everyone involuntarily became startled when they saw the human figures that appeared in the sky.</p><br/><p>At this moment, both of Xiao Yan\u2019s sleeves were torn apart, revealing his naked arms. There were also numerous small blood traces that faintly covered his arms. His face was also a little pale and the corner of his mouth had the vague traces of blood. His originally powerful aura had also become much weaker at this moment. Clearly, the soul-stirring big collision earlier had still shaken him until he had received some serious injuries despite him having been considered to have received it.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan appeared miserable, Yun Shan on the other side was also not safe and sound. His clothes were just as broken and his shriveled hand that was revealed outside his sleeves trembled slightly. A thread of blood followed his palm and flowed downward before finally moving along his finger and quietly dripped down.</p><br/><p>Quite a number of people quietly inhaled a breath of cool air as they looked at Yun Shan with blood dripping from his hand. Their gazes immediately looked at the black-robed, young man with surprise. No one expected this fellow to be able to receive the frightening blow from Yun Shan earlier and also cause some injuries to appear on the latter\u2019s body\u2026</p><br/><p>Jia Xingtian, Hai Bodong, and the others in the chaotic battleground also revealed stunned expressions as they looked at Yun Shan, who revealed trembling hands and a dark-water expression. Although they always had confidence in Xiao Yan, their hearts still involuntarily shook when they personally witnessed Xiao Yan receive that frightening attack that could seriously injure even an expert at the peak of the Dou Huang class.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun by the wedding stage also quietly sighed in relief when she saw that Xiao Yan was not killed by Yun Shan\u2019s attack. However, a complicated emotion flashed across her pretty face when she saw the blood dripping from Yun Shan\u2019s hand. She did not wish to see Xiao Yan die in Yun Shan\u2019s hand but she similarly did not wish to see Yun Shan be killed by Xiao Yan. However, at this moment, she could only quietly wait for the end of the battle below.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou damn brat. It is really unexpected that this ancestor still underestimated you in the end\u2026\u201d Yun Shan\u2019s expression was gloomy as his hand wiped over his robes and removed the fresh blood on it. After which, he raised his head and looked at Xiao Yan whose aura was a little sluggish. He spoke in a dense voice, \u201cIt is likely that the Dou Technique earlier is of quite a high class right? The Dou Qi it requires should also be extremely great. How many times can the current you use it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan wiped away the trace of blood from the corner of his mouth as he said faintly, \u201cEnough to let you know what a serious injury is called\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Yun Shan laughed in a cold and dark manner as he said, \u201cThat earlier Dou Technique of yours might indeed have a great strength that even I dare not underestimate. However, I\u2019m afraid that it is still a little lacking if you want to rely on it to kill a Dou Zong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. His fist had also slowly tightened. Although Yun Shan\u2019s words did indeed cause people to be irritated, it was also true. With his current strength, using this \u2018Open Mountain Seal,\u2019 which he was not very familiar with, to neutralize Yun Shan\u2019s similarly extremely powerful attack was already quite outstanding. Unless Yun Shan simply stood there and forcefully received a blow without any defenses, trying to rely on this to defeat him in one go would likely be quite difficult\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan tightened his fist and his gaze also glanced at the battle situation at Yao Lao\u2019s side. He involuntarily knit his brows.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Yao Lao and that Protector Wu had basically descended into an unusually fiery hot stalemate. Both parties used all of their killing moves with many dangerous situations repeatedly appearing. However, they still maintained a strange equilibrium. No matter how they increased their strength, they still had difficulty causing the other party to feel any actual harm. From the looks of the situation, it may be said that Yao Lao had a faint advantage but Xiao Yan, who clearly understood Yao Lao, knew that due to him being a Spiritual Body, Yao Lao\u2019s endurance was far inferior to an elite Dou Zong despite him possessing the strength to contend against one. Hence, this kind of stalemate was in reality not very beneficial to Yao Lao. Once that Protector Wu managed to take an opportunity when Yao Lao\u2019s strength weakened, it was likely that a big change would appear in this battle\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly withdrew his gaze from the battleground. He once again looked at the chaotic big battleground in the distant. The fighting and killing there was even more chaotic and intense. There would frequently be some experts who fell from it with serious injuries, ending up with an unknown fate. The Misty Cloud Sect could be said to have sent out all their elites at this moment, going all out to block the sharp attacks by the experts from the alliance.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze swiftly swept over Hai Bodong and the couple of other people within the chaotic battleground. He let out a slight sigh of relief. It was fortunate that they were in an advantageous situation in this exchange between top level experts. It was likely that if they were given sufficient time, they would be able to defeat their opponents. At that time, once Hai Bodong and the other experts managed to free themselves, this chaotic battleground would begin to stabilize itself.</p><br/><p>During the movement of his gaze, Xiao Yan had also glanced at the area below the Misty Cloud Mountain. There was the faint sounds of killing being transmitted from there. It was likely that the one hundred thousand strong imperial army at the bottom of the mountain had begun their attack.</p><br/><p>Currently, killing and fighting had erupted in almost from every single spot of the Misty Cloud Mountain. This sect, which was usually quiet, was now completely covered in a terribly bloody storm.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze swept all around once before it was swiftly withdrawn. He slowly exhaled a breath of air and his eyes flickered as he looked at Yun Shan in front of him, who showed a savage smile on the corner of his mouth. Xiao Yan lowered his gaze slightly and glanced at the dense white ring on his finger. After a brief moment of hesitation within his heart, Xiao Yan clenched his teeth violently. It was likely that he could only use this killing weapon if he really wanted to defeat Yun Shan!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan made up his mind within his heart. He ceased hesitating as he moved his hand. A cluster of medicinal pills appeared in his hand before he stuffed them into his mouth and chewed with all his might.</p><br/><p>The Dou Qi exhausted by an \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 formed from the combination of two kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 was not any less than using the \u2018Open Mountain Seal\u2019. The Dou Qi that was required for the merger of three kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 naturally increased by multiple times. Hence, the current him needed to go all out and enable the Dou Qi within his body to be maintained at a filled condition.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gorged down the medicinal pills into his stomach but did not split his attention to refine them. Being in possession of a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 like the \u2018Glazed Lotus Core Flame\u2019, he need not pay too much attention to the medicinal pills that he swallowed. The \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 would automatically refine them. Finally, they would transform into the purest Dou Qi that would flow into his spacious veins.</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s face twitched a little as he looked at how Xiao Yan wildly ate the medicinal pills. Even though he was an elite Dou Zong, the medicinal pills which he had stashed away naturally would not exceed Xiao Yan\u2019s rich collection. Hence, he could only open his eyes and watch Xiao Yan\u2019s exhausted Dou Qi slowly recovered with the help of the medicinal pills.</p><br/><p>Of course, it was naturally impossible for Yun Shan to foolishly wait for Xiao Yan to recover his Dou Qi. Hence, the moment that Xiao Yan swallowed those medicinal pills, his body moved abruptly and immediately appeared in front of Xiao Yan in a strange manner. His hand slashed at Xiao Yan\u2019s throat. Under the cover of that deep-green Dou Qi, his fingernails were not any weaker than sharp blades.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s body leaned back slightly and Yun Shan\u2019s hand was close to Xiao Yan\u2019s neck as it sliced through the air. The dense, cold wind caused Xiao Yan\u2019s skin to feel a chill.</p><br/><p>A silver glow flickered under Xiao Yan\u2019s feet as his body leaned back. His body immediately rushed away. While he did so, he flicked his finger and the Heavy Xuan Ruler flashed and appeared. His feet violently kicked the ruler\u2019s hilt and the heavy ruler carried a ferocious strength that shot toward Yun Shan who wanted to give chase.</p><br/><p>The heavy ruler that rushed over caused Yun Shan\u2019s body to pause. He ruthlessly smashed his fist forward and sent the heavy ruler flying.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s finger shook just as Yun Shan sent the heavy ruler flying. The dense white colored ring burst apart and a cluster of fierce dense white flame swiftly surfaced in front of Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan tore apart the \u2018Glazed Lotus Core Flame\u2019 at the same time that he saw the dense white flame appear. The former turned into a cluster of green-colored flames and an invisible one. Soon after, Xiao Yan clapped his hands together without hesitating and the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 and the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 were pressed into the cluster of dense white-colored flame.</p><br/><p>The space around Xiao Yan began to ripple when the three kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 made contact.</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s expression changed drastically when he saw the actions of Xiao Yan. He could sense the three different colored flames in front of Xiao Yan were deriving an extremely frightening energy!</p><br/><p>Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s body instantly disappeared at almost the same time. He must interrupt this frightening attack by Xiao Yan. Otherwise...</p><br/><p>Yun Shan, who had transformed into a black shadow that rushed over, similarly caused Xiao Yan\u2019s expression to change slightly. The blackish-green wings on his back were flapped. Both of his hands tightly held the cluster of three different colored flames, which were swiftly mixing, as his body swiftly withdrew. On top of dodging, Xiao Yan also flicked his finger and some jade bottles suddenly shot out from the storage ring. There was a palm-sized fire lotus within each of the jade bottles\u2026</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>The jade bottles flew out and immediately let out a chaotic explosive crackling sound, like a firecracker, at a spot that was not far from Yun Shan.</p><br/><p>Although these small fire lotus were unable to cause much injuries to Yun Shan, they were indeed able to slow down his chasing speed. Hence, Xiao Yan had stopped his fleeing stance a short distance away when Yun Shan was breaking through the unceasing number of fire lotus explosions.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s gaze slowly shifted away from Xiao Yan\u2019s pale, weak face that carried some solemness before finally stopping on his hands. At this moment, Yun Shan suddenly shrank his eyes!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan flapped the blackish-green wings on his back in the air. His face was pale-white as his breathing became unusually weary. A foot wide three different colored fire lotus was gently floating above his palm. A frighteningly wild and violent energy slowly seeped out, causing shock to surge up on the faces of everyone present!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

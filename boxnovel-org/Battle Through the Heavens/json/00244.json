The rest of the members of the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019 began to busily clear up their headquarters, which had become a mess. Occasionally, when some mercenaries passed by the parlor, they would throw a respectful gaze at the young man seated beside the table who was smiling warmly as he gently sipped his tea.</p><br/><p>The terrified feeling that they had because of Xiao Yan\u2019s vicious action had been sustained for awhile before it slowly disappeared from these mercenaries\u2019 hearts. They were all people who frequently licked the blood from their blades. The extent of toughness of their minds was naturally far greater than that of ordinary people\u2019s. Moreover, since Mo Ran was the enemy of the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019, it was not worthwhile for anyone to show the slightest pity for him. This was because they clearly understood that if Xiao Yan had not arrived in time today, then Mo Ran would not have shown any mercy when killing their brothers.</p><br/><p>(TL: The brothers here does not refer to blood brothers. Rather, it refers to people extremely close to one another)</p><br/><p>Carrying the warm tea cup, Xiao Yan glanced at the mercenaries who were busy outside. On the chair beside him was Hai Bo Dong whose face had remained indifferent. This person who was once the Ice Emperor did not show any friendly smile because of the relationship Xiao Ding and Xiao Li had with Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Mister Hai is my friend. His temper may be somewhat temperamental, ha ha, but he is a truly strong person.\u201d Eyeing Hai Bo Dong who had remained quiet ever since he entered the room, Xiao Yan could only helplessly shake his head and tell Xiao Ding and Xiao Li on the opposite side with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ding smiled and nodded his head. The corner of his gaze swept across Hai Bo Dong. His senses vaguely told him that under the skinny and hunched body of this indifferent old man, there was a terrifying energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, the strong naturally have the temperament of the strong. Otherwise, how can he demonstrate his individuality?\u201d Xiao Ding laughed softly and joked.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also laughed. He then inquired after Xiao Li\u2019s injuries before he frowned slightly and asked, \u201cCan you tell me what exactly has happened? Why did the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 suddenly have so many more strong people. Also, what has happened to that little girl Qing Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s questions, the smile on Xiao Ding\u2019s face slowly disappeared. He laughed bitterly and sighed before musing for awhile, seeming to be arranging his words. A long while later, he finally said slowly, \u201cHalf a month ago, Qing Lin never returned after going out once. After our investigation, she seems to have been captured by someone. At the place where she disappeared, we found traces of an intense battle. That place also had many snake scales that were covered with fresh blood, which I think have been peeled off from the Two-Headed Flame Spirit Serpent of Qing Lin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing able to defeat the Two-Headed Flame Spirit Serpent and capturing Qin Lin, the other party must at least be a Dou Ling.\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s finger gently knocked against the table\u2019s surface as he knit his eyebrows tightly together. He asked uncertainly, \u201cBut who would act against Qing Lin? She is but a little girl. Which Dou Ling would actually lower himself and target her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are also not too certain.\u201d Xiao Ding smiled bitterly and shook his head. He continued, \u201cIt is also the second day after Qing Lin disappeared when the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 suddenly began to swallow or clean-up the other strengths in the city. With the strength of the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 in the Rock Desert City, other than us and two or three other mercenary Companies, it was impossible for the remaining strengths to contend with them. Therefore, in less than five days, the other weak strengths within the city were completely cleared up by them in a lightning like manner.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this point in time, the mercenary companies with stronger strengths finally realized their intentions. We immediately formed an alliance to fight with the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019. According to our calculation, even if the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 had Luo Bu, who is a Da Dou Shi, it was impossible for the company to easily defeat our alliance. However, in the next few days that followed, a Da Dou Shi and quite a number of Dou Shis suddenly appeared within the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnder such a large increase in the opponent\u2019s strength, we began to panic internally. After all, it was a loose alliance formed at the last moment. Therefore, it did not have much binding strength. As a result, under the situation of fighting among themselves, the other three mercenary companies ended up with one being destroyed, one surrendered and one which chose to leave this city after giving the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 a huge payment to beg for peace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for us, since the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019 was the most difficult bone to swallow for them, we were left for the last. Explaining what happened today. If you had come a little later, I\u2019m afraid that the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019 would have been annihilated.\u201d Xiao Ding sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know about the background of those people who suddenly joined the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019?\u201d Xiao Yan slowly stroked the warm tea cup as he softly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are not sure.\u201d Xiao Ding shook his head. An expression of deep thought appeared on his face and a moment later, hesitatingly said, \u201cI seem to feel that Qing Lin\u2019s disappearance had some relation to the strong people who suddenly joined the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019. After all, the timing of these two events seemed to be a little too coincidental.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Flame Spirit Serpent that Qing Lin owns should only be known by very few people. Then why would they choose to attack her?\u201d Xiao Yan frowned and the finger that was knocking the table suddenly paused. He muttered in his heart, \u201cDon\u2019t tell it is because of the Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe also don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening.\u201d Xiao Ding and Xiao Li exchanged glances. Their faces were filled with bitter smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou may not know, but I think that Luo Bu that guy should know.\u201d Xiao Yan sat up and smiled. He said, \u201cI will go and find him and see exactly where his courage came from at the same time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh. We will go and gather some people. Let\u2019s go together. They have many people.\u201d Xiao Ding voiced his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo what you want.\u201d Regarding this, Xiao Yan was noncommittal as he nodded his head. He stood up and headed out of the door. When he passed by Hai Bo Dong, he smiled and said, \u201cOld Mister Hai, do you intend to follow along?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m also bored of staying here, so I\u2019ll follow you to watch the fun. But don\u2019t think of asking me to act. The price for me doing anything is very expensive.\u201d Hai Bo Dong laughed faintly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded before opening his stride and exiting the hall. Behind him, Hai Bo Dong lazily followed. Further behind, Xiao Ding and Xiao Li swiftly gathered over fifty highly capable members and the entire group of people aggressively charged out of the headquarters. Their faces were filled with killing intent as they headed directly towards the territory of the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019, preparing to kill.</p><br/><p>On the main road, when the surrounding passersby saw this group of fierce faced mercenaries who had suddenly leaped out, they hurriedly made way. Immediately, their bizarre gazes eyed this group of men. Soft whispers rang out among themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, aren\u2019t they the members of the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019? Why do they dare to come out during this time? Aren\u2019t they afraid of the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi, I had just heard from a member of the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 that their mission this time around had failed. Their Da Dou Shi also died in the hands of the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019. Right now, it\u2019s likely that these guys intend to go and find trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? That Da Dou Shi of the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 is dead? When did a strong person who could contend with a Da Dou Shi appear in the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, it\u2019s that young man in black clothes leading the group. Hee hee, are you very shocked? But that Da Dou Shi called Mo Ran was really killed by him under the clear view of everyone.\u201d A passerby who seemed to know some insider information eyed the skinny looking young man in front of the group of large mercenaries with a respectful gaze as he said with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn. How can it be? I\u2019m afraid that that young man isn\u2019t even twenty years old. How can he defeat a Da Dou Shi?\u201d The people surrounding the passerby were all stunned and had faces filled with disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cChe, wait and see. This time around, I think that the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 is going to have extremely bad luck. Who asked them to be so arrogant during this period of time. Hee hee.\u201d The passerby laughed in a gloating manner.</p><br/><p>Under the watch of numerous gazes in the city, Xiao Yan\u2019s group passed through a few streets and after ten minutes, the tightly guarded \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 headquarters that was like a metal pail, appeared in everyone\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>Currently, the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 had obviously received the information about Mo Ran being killed. Therefore, the entrance had a large number of mercenaries carrying shiny weapons patrolling. Their tensed faces were extremely grave. When they noticed the large group of \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019 appear at the end of the street, a panic immediate swarmed onto their faces. A few mercenaries used both their hands and legs to claw into the huge door and rushed to report the matter.</p><br/><p>Watching those \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 mercenaries whose bodies were trembling slightly as they carried their weapons and gathered at the large door, Xiao Yan\u2019s group slowly came to a stop just outside the entrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the territory of the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019. What are all of you here for?\u201d Seeing the group of large men with ferocious faces and fierce eyes blocking the front door, a bony mercenary company roared with a brave exterior while feeling weak inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cCall Luo Bu to get his a*s out.\u201d Xiao Yan picked away at his finger nail before raising his head and told the guy with a smile.</p><br/><p>Silence. Eyeing the young man in black clothes standing right at the front, all of the mercenaries at the door maintained silence. From the mouths of those people who had returned from the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019 just now, they already knew that the Da Dou Shi had died in an extremely miserable condition in this warmly smiling young man\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, I will just go in and look for him myself.\u201d Seeing the silent mercenaries, Xiao Yan helplessly smiled and slowly took a step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHua hua.\u201d As Xiao Yan took a step forward, the mercenaries at the door immediately hurriedly took a step back with panicked faces. Their orderly footsteps were quite funny to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Company leader issued an order. Kill them at all cost! Whoever kills this black clothed person will be rewarded with fifty thousand gold coins!\u201d In the midst of the silence, a loud shout suddenly sounded from behind the large door.</p><br/><p>As the shout fell, the eyes of the mercenaries at the door immediately brightened. The gazes that they eyed Xiao Yan had less terror and more greed.</p><br/><p>Clearly sensing the change in these people, Xiao Yan gently shook his head. He was too lazy to say any nonsense. After waving his hand to block those \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019 members behind him who were preparing to draw their blades, he once again took a step forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d Under that enormous reward, there was finally a mercenary who could not resist the temptation. He tightly held his sharp weapon and charged at Xiao Yan with a ferocious face, intending to kill him.</p><br/><p>His action undoubtedly created a chain effect. Immediately, the mercenaries behind him wore fierce faces as they held their weapons tightly and charged at Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Eyeing the tens of mercenaries charging over, Xiao Yan gently exhaled a breath. His hands rotated slightly and was abruptly pushed forward. \u201cFire Palm!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Xiao Yan\u2019s palm was pushed forward, an uncomparable ferocious force suddenly surfaced. After which, it carried a wind, that had the power to overturn a huge rock, and smashed the chests of the tens of mercenaries.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug, grug.\u201d</p><br/><p>When the wind smashed on their bodies, it was like they had been struck by a thousand catty (500kg) huge rock. The faces of the tens of mercenaries which were filled with killing intent immediately turned white. Instantly, they began vomiting mouthful after mouthful of blood, as though it had started to rain blood.</p><br/><p>Clapping his palms gently, Xiao Yan glanced at the large door which had become empty in an instant. He turned around and said with a smile to the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenaries\u2019 who had completely stunned faces, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having said that, he took the lead and stepped through the doorway. His blatant manner made it appear as if he was entering his own home.</p><br/><p>Eyeing the back of the young man in front of them, everyone exchanged glances as they felt speechless. Knocking aside tens of ordinary mercenaries with one palm. Wasn\u2019t this person a little too abnormal?</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, what an abnormal guy.\u201d Xiao Li sighed. He exchanged glances with Xiao Ding and the both of them shook their heads helplessly before opening their strides and followed.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 was indeed the most powerful strength in the Rock Desert City. They had just entered the courtyard when over a hundred mercenaries carrying shining weapons immediately surrounded them. Although they had a weaker killing atmosphere compared to the \u2018Desert Metal\u2019 mercenaries, they did have some momentum after having so many people gathered together.</p><br/><p>Eyeing the large group of mercenaries blocking his front, Xiao Yan\u2019s footsteps did not pause even the slightest bit. As his palm pushed forward, ferocious forces came from all directions and were extremely overbearing as they surged out. Under the attack of this force, any mercenary below the strength of a five star Dou Zhe would throw up blood and fall back. Only some who had a slightly greater strength were able to block this wide range attacking by Xiao Yan. However, before they had time to rejoice at overcoming Xiao Yan\u2019s driving air attack, the ghost like figure would flash in front of them. A fist that did not appear to be using much power would cause a mercenary to faint from serious injury each time it was weightlessly thrown forward.</p><br/><p>All the way in, as he eyed those \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 mercenaries collapsing on the two sides of the small path repeatedly rolling and groaning, Xiao Yan finally once again experienced the strength of a Xuan Class Qi Method. If this happened in the past, he would only be able to use the \u2018Flame Palm\u2019 Dou Technique five times before the Dou Qi in his body announced that it was exhausted. However, the Xuan Class Qi Method he currently had was able to support his random squandering. The difference between them was like that of the earth and sky!</p><br/><p>Going on a rampage throughout the walk, Xiao Yan seemed to have attacked until he formed an addiction. His body turned into a black shadow and shuttled through the mercenary group whose strength was only that of an ordinary Dou Zhe. The places where he flashed by had blood dancing all over the sky and human figures being shot backward.</p><br/><p>Following behind Xiao Yan, Xiao Ding and the rest were speechless as they eyed the mercenaries in front who were repeatedly throwing up blood or thrown backward. Since they had entered the door until now, they did not even have a single chance to attack. The black clothed young man in front of them seemed to have an inexhaustible vigor and Dou Qi. This squandering without any pity caused the people at the side to feel a little heartache.</p><br/><p>Stepping over some fainted mercenaries\u2019 bodies with agile footsteps, their gazes looked around the extremely messy courtyard and sighed gently. This guy could well terminate the entire \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 on his own.</p><br/><p>In the large hall which had its door tightly shut, tens of people were walking about uneasily. As they heard the blood-curling screams that sounded not far outside the door, their faces were completely filled with alarm. A panicked atmosphere covered the interior of the entire hall.</p><br/><p>On the leader\u2019s seat in the hall, Luo Bu\u2019s face was a little pale as he sat on it. The tea cup which he held in his hand trembled slightly. He lifted his head to eye the hall before turning it toward the few people not far from him. These people did not wear the uniform of the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 Their chests also did not have the badge for the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already told the few of you that Xiao Ding and Xiao Li of the \u2018Desert Mercenary Company\u2019 have a younger brother with a terrifying strength. Yet you all still insisted on destroying them. Look at things now. That guy has returned. Now they have even attacked. How can we resist them?\u201d Luo Bu\u2019s voice appeared somewhat sharp because of his anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompany Leader Luo Bu, you need not worry too much. That person\u2019s strength is indeed a little strong, but from the situation of his fight with Elder Mo Ran, it is far from the possibility of being a Dou Wang as you have said. Although he finally defeated Elder Mo Ran, he was also slightly injured. Therefore, I guess that his strength is at most a two star or a three star Da Dou Shi. However, Company Leader Luo Bu, you are a four star Da Dou Shi. Why do you need to fear him? Moreover, as long as you endure for this period of time, we will transmit the news and our clan\u2019s First Elder will hurry over. When that time comes, with the elder\u2019s Dou Ling strength, would he be afraid of this lightweight?\u201d The man in his prime who was probably the leader of the group laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether or not he conserved his strength in his fight with Mo Ran but back then, he had come to my room in a bizarre manner. I dare say that the kind of speed is something that even a normal Dou Ling would not be able to possess.\u201d Luo Bu\u2019s face was gloomy as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then did Company Leader Luo Bu exchange blows with him?\u201d The man asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, that\u2019s right. Perhaps his speed may be very fast, but in a fight between the strong, speed is not the most important thing. Perhaps that guy only has fast speed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, hesitation flashed across Luo Bu\u2019s face. His heart gradually began to think it over. He nodded his head slightly. Back then, because of Xiao Yan\u2019s bizarre appearance, he was shaken until he had somewhat panicked and jumpy. Now that he thought about it, how could a young man that was not even twenty be a Dou Wang? Even if he ate all sorts of natural treasures everyday and high tier medicinal pills, that was definitely impossible.</p><br/><p>Thinking in this manner, the gloominess on Luo Bu\u2019s face gradually disappeared. He clenched his fist tightly and swallowed a mouthful of saliva with a \u2018Pei\u2019 sound. He viciously said, \u201cJust as well. This time, let me take a look at just how strong this guy actually this. I really don\u2019t believe that he alone can knock aside the ten plus Dou Shis in here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the imposing manner of Luo Bu gradually returning, everyone in the hall who had a tensed expression quietly heaved a sigh of relief. At this moment, if even the leader did not possess any intention to fight, it would really be hopeless.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>As everyone\u2019s heart gradually became heated up, a bang sounded. The tightly closed door was convulsed into countless broken pieces which shot in all directions.</p><br/><p>In the doorway, the sawdust gradually scattered and a black garment slowly appeared in everyone\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, is it very fun to hide in here?\u201d A faint joking laughter floated into the hall.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

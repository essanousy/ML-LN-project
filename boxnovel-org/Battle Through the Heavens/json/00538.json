Both of them involuntarily laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Hao, I really have to thank you very much this time around.\u201d Xiao Yan walked a little closer and softly said, \u201cThere will definitely be a reward for you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, this is but a small matter. Our ears will be a little quieter now that that fellow has lost the thing he boasts about in front of us.\u201d Elder Hao waved his hand. However, from the looks of his expression, Xiao Yan\u2019s words still caused him to be quite happy. After all, he already had some intention of befriending Xiao Yan after witnessing the latter\u2019s refinement skills. He was already quite happy at being able to get a tier five alchemist to owe him a favor that was neither large nor small.</p><br/><p>The two of them chatted and laughed as they walked out of this quiet area where the Elders resided. The two of them separated at a fork in the road. Elder Hao needed to return to guard the medicinal warehouse, and Xiao Yan needed to return to \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stood at the forked road and eyed Elder Hao\u2019s back which had disappeared. He let out a long sigh, and the joy within his heart involuntarily surfaced on his face. Now that he had fully prepared all the things he needed, all that was left was the refinement. However, the \u2018Ground Spirit Pill\u2019 was a tier 6 medicinal pill. With his current strength, he could merely refine some common tier 5 medicinal pills. He need not even be bothered about thinking of a tier 6 medicinal pill. Therefore, it was likely that Yao Lao would need to act to refine the \u2018Ground Spirit Pill\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, we are pressed for time. There is no telling when the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 will erupt. Therefore, it is best to refine this \u2018Ground Spirit Pill\u2019 as soon as possible.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s voice also quietly sounded within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart while the latter was in deep thought.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan raised his head slightly. He eyed the deserted area around him and nodded his head without leaving a trace. His footsteps walked toward the area where \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 was located as he softly asked in his heart, \u201cIn that case, when does Teacher intend to act?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is for best that we do it during these next few days.\u201d Yao Lao voiced his thoughts, \u201cYou should first rest for one to two days. After which, we will need to enter deep into the mountains once again. Some unusual phenomenon occurs in the sky when refining a tier 6 medicinal pill. Moreover, this \u2018Ground Spirit Pill\u2019 can be considered among the top even within the tier 6 medicinal pills. Hence, there might be quite a great movement. As such, we will definitely be exposed if we were to refine it within the Inner Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head, indicating that he understood. He quietly mused for a while within his heart before he gradually hastened his footsteps. A short while later, he appeared outside of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019. Perhaps it was because it was currently at night, but the people who were waiting at this place to challenge him had all disappeared. This caused Xiao Yan to save the trouble of secretly flying in again. He arranged his robes before openly walking in through the main entrance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan spent the next two days training quietly within \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019. He did not enter the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019. Moreover, no problems occurred within \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 during these two days. Currently, the sale of medicinal pills by \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 dominated seventy-percent of the market of the academy. An increasing number of older students had also wanted to enter after hearing the name of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019. Moreover, the number of alchemists in \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 increased from the original three to the current six after a stringent selection period. Therefore, the speed at which the medicinal pills were refined had also increased by quite a lot.</p><br/><p>Currently, the strength of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 was already a faction that was sufficient enough to rival that of some of the top tier factions within the Inner Academy under the support of the powerful \u2018Fire Energy\u2019. Moreover, two strong people who had reached the strength of three star Dou Lings ended up joining \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 due to the attraction of the reward and punishment system that Xun Er and the others had set up. This was something that Xiao Yan had not expected.</p><br/><p>Hence, \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 currently possessed three elite Dou Lings if these two Dou Ling were included. This line-up caused it to have the qualification to truly become a top tier faction. Moreover, under the support of its powerful finances, someone who was able to become a member of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 already possessed the capital to boast to people around them.</p><br/><p>The current \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 was as different as the clouds in the sky and the mud on the ground when compared to the \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 formed from new students half a year ago.</p><br/><p>By being able to transform a mediocre faction into a powerful one within half a year, Xiao Yan\u2019s name also began to spread around the Inner Academy in an increasingly loud manner. Although he was merely ranked thirty-four on the \u2018Strong Ranking\u2019, his reputation was enough to catch up with those top experts in the top ten.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan finally ended his training retreat on the third day. He had firmly stabilized his strength at the one star Dou Ling level today. Moreover, his Dou Qi had also advanced quite significantly due to him refining medicinal pills a couple of times. According to this speed, he would not need much time to enter into the peak of a one star Dou Ling.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan walked downstairs after coming out of his room. He saw Hu Jia\u2019s figure within the hall, and felt a much stronger Qi from her. Xiao Yan understood that she had actually benefited from her misfortune of being injured this time, allowing her to breakthrough to the level of a nine star Da Dou Shi. With her training talent, she might not need much time before she truly breakthrough to become a Dou Ling. At that time, \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 would have an additional Dou Ling. Oh no, it should be two more. He must not exclude that battle lunatic Wu Hao. With the way he crazily fought everyday in the Fighting Arena, Xiao Yan guessed that the latter might well enter the Dou Ling class earlier than Hu Jia.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan walked into the hall and carelessly ate some breakfast. He briefly told Xun Er that he needed to once again enter the deep mountains this time around. The latter also felt somewhat stunned when she heard that Xiao Yan was going back after having only just returned for a couple of days. However, she found it hard to say anything to stop Xiao Yan when she saw his serious expression. All she did was merely nod her head obediently.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo, be careful. I will take care of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019.\u201d Xun Er said with a soft smile when she saw Xiao Yan standing up and preparing to leave after having eaten his breakfast.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, you have all worked really hard. I will return after a couple of days this time around.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded to Xun Er and Hu Jia. He pulled open the door and an eye-piercing sunlight caused him to narrow his eyes. Immediately, he let out a smile and proudly walked out.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan ran to the exit of the Inner Academy after leaving \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019. Only after leaving the Inner Academy did he search for a remote location. After which, he summoned his Purple Cloud Wings and swiftly rose into the air. His body transformed into a black shadow that swiftly flew into the deep mountains.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan flapped the Purple Cloud Wings and flew for nearly an hour. After he figured out that he had already entered the middle region of the mountain range, he gradually slowed down. He spent half an hour searching a precipitous mountain peak that was merely a few dozen feet wide before slowly descending.</p><br/><p>These few mountain peaks were nearly completely vertical. If one did not borrow the help of wings, it was impossible to climb to its peak without the support of powerful Dou Qi. Moreover, there were a couple of even taller mountain peaks standing around it. Coincidentally they covered this small mountain peak within enormous lush green trees.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s figure immediately drifted out when Xiao Yan landed on the top of this small mountain. The former eyed his surroundings before nodding with some satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should not be too far away while I am refining the \u2018Ground Spirit Pill\u2019. You need to carefully observe my refining methods. Although you are able to be extremely sought after no matter where you are given your current medicinal refinement skills, you still have an extremely large gap when compared with a true alchemist grandmaster.\u201d Yao Lao spoke to Xiao Yan in a solemn manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan hurriedly nodded when he heard this. Being able to observe an alchemist grandmaster refining a medicinal pill was something that one might encounter, but could not wish for. It had extremely great benefits for him.</p><br/><p>TL: something that one might encounter, but could not wish for - meaning that if one is lucky one will meet it. Otherwise, one will not get the chance regardless of how much they desire</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, you must keep a distance from the unnatural phenomenon when the pill is formed. Otherwise, it would be troublesome if you are accidentally injured.\u201d Yao Lao sat cross-legged on the grass as he reminded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake out the medicinal ingredients.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s expression gradually became solemn as he exhaled a deep breath of air and instructed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan swiftly took out the few extremely rare medicinal ingredients from his storage ring when he heard Yao Lao\u2019s instruction. He placed them orderly in front of him. In an instant, a rich medicinal fragrance covered this small mountain peak. When one inhaled a deep breath, it caused one to feel relaxed and happy.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s gaze slowly swept over the few medicinal ingredients. He nodded slightly before waving his hand toward Xiao Yan. The ancient dark-black ring on the latter\u2019s hand immediately came off automatically. Finally, it floated in front of Yao Lao.</p><br/><p>The black-colored ring glowed and flickered. Immediately, a five-foot-tall, dark-black medicinal cauldron suddenly appeared.</p><br/><p>The entire body of the dark-black medicinal cauldron had strange flame lines painted all over it. At a glance, those flames appeared to have intelligence. They wiggled slightly appearing to be living creatures.</p><br/><p>The appearance of this medicinal cauldron caused Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth to salivate more. Back then, he had seen Yao Lao summon it before. However, he was basically a novice back then. How would he be painstakingly aware of just how valuable this medicinal cauldron was within the alchemist world?</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack Demon\u2026 tsk tsk. When can I get my hands on one of these medicinal cauldrons which is on the \u2018Heavenly Cauldron Ranking\u2019?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze was blurred as he eyed this dark-black medicinal cauldron with an extraordinary aura. His tone was filled with desire as he spoke. The medicinal cauldrons that he used in the past were totally piles of garbage when compared with this \u2018Black Demon\u2019.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao eyed those glowing eyes of Xiao Yan and shook his head, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. He said, \u201cThis kind of medicinal cauldron which is ranked within the \u2018Heavenly Cauldron Rank\u2019 possesses some spirituality. Moreover, I have also applied a spiritual imprint on this \u2018Black Demon\u2019. Currently, you are unable to use it. I will be able to remove the spiritual imprint once I possess a body that can host a spirit. You will be able to randomly use it at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out silly laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. The refinement is about to begin. Little fellow, don\u2019t be distracted.\u201d Yao Lao laughed. His face gradually became serious. It was apparent how serious he was toward this refinement through his act of summoning the \u2018Black Demon\u2019 to refine the medicinal pill.</p><br/><p>A shriveled eagle claw like illusionary hand extended slightly. Immediately, a cluster of thick white flame appeared out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>The surrounding temperature declined greatly the moment the thick white flame appeared. Although the temperature had declined, the flame rose even more intensely. The two completely opposite perceptions caused it to appear extremely strange.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao waved his hand. The thick white flame instantly swarmed into the medicinal cauldron. In an instant, a raging intense flame rose from within the cauldron.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the refinement of the tier 6 \u2018Ground Spirit Pill\u2019 had officially begun!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

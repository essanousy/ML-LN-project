Putting his hands together, he smiled: \u201cClan leader Xiao Zhan. The reason we came here for today is because we would like your help for something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Ge Ye, if you have any problems just let me know. If I can help you solve it, then I definitely wouldn\u2019t dare say no.\u201d To the visiting elder, Xiao Zhan did not refuse but since he did not know what the request was, he did not make any promises either.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Leader Xiao, do you know her?\u201d Ge Ye smiled lightly and pointed to the girl next to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUmm\u2026 I\u2019m sorry, this girl is\u2026\u201d Xiao Zhan looked over the girl and awkwardly shook his head.</p><br/><p>When Nalan Yanran became Yun Jun\u2019s student, she was only 8. After studying in the Faction of Misty Clouds for 5 years, she had changed quite a lot. Before she was only a child but now she is a blooming teenager!</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026Her name is Nalan Yanran.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Xiao, I haven\u2019t come to pay my respect in a long time. It\u2019s my fault that you don\u2019t recognize me.\u201d Nalan Yanran sweetly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Yanran, I heard that you\u2019ve become a student under Yun Jun. At the time, I thought that it was just a baseless rumour, but now I realize that it\u2019s actually true. What incredible talent you must have\u2026\u201d Xiao Zhan complimented.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was just good luck\u2026\u201d Smiling lightly, Nalan Yanran began to feel uncomfortable and lightly tugged Ge Ye\u2019s robe with her hand under the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Leader Xiao, the request that I have relates to Yanran. In addition, this was assigned by our faction leader\u2026\u201d Ge Ye kept his smile but when he mentioned the faction leader, he subconsciously lessened his smile and his face grew serious.</p><br/><p>Like Ge Ye, Xiao Zhan stopped smiling. The faction leader of the Faction of Misty Clouds was one of the most important people in the entire Jia Ma Empire. Xiao Zhan, who was a small clan leader, wouldn\u2019t dare to provoke her. But with her power, what would she need Xiao Clan to help with? Ge Ye did say that it was related to Yanran, is it that?</p><br/><p>A wandering thought crossed Xiao Zhan\u2019s mind causing the edge of his mouth to twitch slightly and his firm hand to start trembling, thankfully his hands were covered by his long sleeves. Taking care to push down the thought, Xiao Zhan shakily asked: \u201cMister Ge Ye, please do tell me what is the faction\u2019s request?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cErrr\u2026\u201d Ge Ye hesitated but he thought about how much the faction leader adored Yanran and thus, he clenched his teeth: \u201cLeader Xiao, you know how strict the rules are in the faction. In addition, faction leader views Yanran very highly, in fact, faction leader is expecting Yanran to be the next faction leader. However, due to a special rule, future faction leaders cannot have a relation with another male before they become the official faction leader\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking a breath, Ge Ye continued: \u201cWhen our faction leader asked Yanran about it, she realized that Yanran and the Xiao Clan had a marriage proposal, therefore, faction leader asks for Leader Xiao to\u2026 to cancel this marriage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKA!\u201d The jade cup in Xiao Zhan\u2019s hands turned into a fine mist in an instant.</p><br/><p>In the main hall, everyone was silent. The three clan elders were shocked by Ge Ye\u2019s words but soon afterwards, the elders glanced at Xiao Zhan with plain glee and ridicule.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, how will you respond to this?\u201d The three elders thought sinisterly.</p><br/><p>A couple of the younger kids didn\u2019t know about the set marriage between Xiao Yan and Nalan Yanran, but after asking their parents about it, their faces brightened! Their glances towards Xiao Yan were full of ridicule and distaste\u2026</p><br/><p>Looking at Xiao Zhan\u2019s dark face, Nalan Yanran lowered her head and squeezed her fingers together.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeader Xiao, I know that this request is a little over the top, but because faction leader requested it, please cancel the marriage\u2026\u201d Helplessly letting out a breath, Ge Ye lightly whispered to Xiao Zhan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhan\u2019s hands curled into fists. A faint green Dou Qi slowly creeped over his body and finally, it formed a illusory lion\u2019s head in front of Xiao Zhan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Clan\u2019s secret Qi Method: Furious Lion\u2019s Rage! Level: Middle Xuan!</p><br/><p>Looking at Xiao Zhan\u2019s reaction, Ge Ye\u2019s face became serious. He moved to place Yanran behind him and within his eagle claw like hands a green Dou Qi gathered. The Dou Qi released small but sharp illusory swords.</p><br/><p>Faction of Misty Cloud\u2019s Qi Method: Green Wood Sword! Level: Low Xuan!</p><br/><p>With the release of Dou Qi, the weaker youngsters within the main hall became pale and felt their chests tighten.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Zhan\u2019s breathing became more intense, the three elders yelled out! Their voices were like lightning that swept through the hall: \u201cXiao Zhan, STOP! Don\u2019t forget, you\u2019re the clan leader of Xiao Clan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhan stiffened and the Dou Qi on his body disappeared slowly\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhan fell back into his chair and emotionlessly watched the lowered head of Yanran. Finally, he said is a raspy tone: \u201cNalan, you have some guts. With such a daughter, I\u2019m really envious of Nalan Su.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran twitched: \u201cUncle Xiao\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! Call me Clan Leader Xiao from now on. I don\u2019t deserve to be called Uncle; you\u2019re the future faction leader of the Faction of Misty Clouds. In the future, you\u2019ll probably one of the most important people in Dou Qi mainland. My Xiao Yan only has modest talent, he doesn\u2019t deserve you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you Clan Leader Xiao.\u201d Hearing Xiao Zhan\u2019s words, Ge Ye\u2019s face brightened. Apologizing, he says: \u201cClan Leader Xiao, faction leader understands that today\u2019s request is quite disrespectful. Therefore, she asked me to bring something, please accept it as an apology from our faction leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ge Ye touched a ring on his hand and suddenly a completely pan-green jade box appeared in his hand\u2026</p><br/><p>Carefully opening the box, a fragrance swept through the entire main hall. Anyone who smelled it felt relaxed.</p><br/><p>The three elders\u2019 curiosity got the better of them and they poked their head to see the contents of the box: \u201cQi Gathering Powder?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

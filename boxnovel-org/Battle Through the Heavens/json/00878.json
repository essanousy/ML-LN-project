She immediately took a gentle breath, arranged her thoughts, and finally said, \u201cActually, the clue regarding this \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 that I mentioned is related to the Pill Tower. My clan once held an Elder Seat in the Pill Tower. Hence, I am also aware of some information related to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Pill Tower again?\u201d Xiao Yan frowned slightly upon hearing this. If the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was in the hands of the Pill Tower, how could he possibly snatch it? The Pill Tower was not the Jia Nan Academy. It would definitely not allow a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 fall into the hands of someone else. Xiao Yan might not be aware of the exact strength of the Burning Flame Valley, but after some vague guess, he at least knew that the Burning Flame Valley was not as strong as the Pill Tower. Therefore, would he not have to choose to offend the even stronger Pill Tower? If this were the case, he would rather just place his intention on the Burning Flame Valley. Things would be a little easier that way.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need not be worried about this. The Nine Dragon Lightning Flame might be a heirloom of the Burning Flame Valley and could be considered an owned object. However, the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 which I have mentioned is currently without an owner despite it being related to the Pill Tower. As long as you possess the ability, anyone who is fated can possess it. Even the Pill Tower would not object on this point. After all, the Pill Tower is not the Burning Flame Valley. They possess an extremely special position on the continent.\u201d Xin Lan explained after having sensed the thoughts within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s frown relaxed a little. He looked at Su Qian by the side. Only after seeing him nod slightly did Xiao Yan say, \u201cBe more clear about this. Additionally, since you know about all this, you should also know just what kind of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 it is, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Xiao, you can rest assured. Xin Lan believes that the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 within the Pill Tower will definitely interest you.\u201d Xin Lan laughed. She immediately raised her snow-white chin and said, \u201cMay I ask if big brother Xiao has heard of the \u2018Three Thousand Burning Flame?\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Three Thousand Burning Flame?\u201d Xiao Yan was initially startled upon hearing this name. A heated expression suddenly erupted within his dark-black eyes. Currently, he could be considered a genuine tier 6 alchemist. Hence, his understanding of the many \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 on the \u2018Heavenly Flame Ranking\u2019 was not as lacking as it was back then. He naturally knew a little about this Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>The Three Thousand Burning Flame was also called the Three Thousand Star Burning Flame. It was ranked nine on the \u2018Heavenly Flame Ranking.\u2019 If one were to talk about it, it was two positions higher than Yao Lao\u2019s \u2018Bone Chilling Flame.\u2019 This kind of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was extremely ethereal and difficult to find. This was because it did not exist on the ground but was instead formed in the distant stars. The ancient text recorded that silver flames would fall from the sky when the Three Thousand Burning Flame was formed, the ground within a thousand kilometers would turn to dust, the day could not be differentiated from night, the stars would not appear, and the sun could not rise.</p><br/><p>Due to it existing within the stars, where ordinary people had great difficulty reaching, the time the Three Thousand Burning Flame could exist was usually a little longer than the other \u2018Heavenly Flames.\u2019 Hence, it was allowed sufficient to evolve. Hence, most of the Three Thousand Burning Flame that were discovered belonged to a kind of intelligent extraordinary natural being. Even if one could find it, it was extremely difficult to capture.</p><br/><p>Of course, the thing that interested Xiao Yan the most was not the high ranking of this Three Thousand Burning Flame. Instead, it was because this kind of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 possessed an extraordinary and special ability. It was the legendary \u2018Three Thousand Star Constitution.\u2019 Of course, this was a nicer name to call it. Most of the experts who had battled with a person who had this Three Thousand Burning Flame would call it an \u2018Undying Body.\u2019 This kind of unusual name was mainly because this Three Thousand Burning Flame was able to allow the person possessing it to have a life force that was unusually tenacious. One would be like the most repulsive \u2018Demon Cockroach Beast\u2019 among the Magical Beast, being able to swiftly recover from one\u2019s injury regardless of what kind of intense attack one suffered. The recovery of one\u2019s fighting strength would also swiftly rise.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it was best if one completely killed a person with an \u2018Undying Body\u2019 while they were engaged in a fight. Otherwise, as long as the other party still had a breath remaining, they would once again become a living dragon and tiger. This recovery speed depended on the seriousness of one\u2019s injuries. Hence, there was seldom anyone who was happy to become a life and death enemy with an expert who possessed the \u2018Three Thousand Burning Flame.\u2019 After all, regardless of who it was, one would have difficulty eating and sleeping in peace if one had an enemy who possessed a life force that was as strong as a Magical Beast.</p><br/><p>Of course, this did not mean that one would really become an undying person if one possessed the Three Thousand Burning Flame. At times, one might suffer some overly serious injuries that the Three Thousand Burning Flame had difficulty healing. Examples of this include one\u2019s heart, head, etc. Should these fatal points suffer a mortal wound, even the Three Thousand Burning Flame would have difficulty healing them\u2026 this was especially the case if they met some expert whose strength far exceeded their own. The other party would likely not give one the slightest opportunity to recover and would directly eliminate them. At that time, the whatever \u2018Undying Body\u2019 would not have the slightest use.</p><br/><p>Having said that, anyone who possessed the \u2018Three Thousand Burning Flame\u2019 would have a life force that would be transformed into something quite frighteningly long. This point would undoubtedly possess a great attraction to any person. After all, everyone would be happy to obtain an even more perfect guarantee of one\u2019s own life. Xiao Yan was no exception to this point.</p><br/><p>The smile on Xin Lan\u2019s face grew even wider when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s expression. She smiled and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right, it is the Three Thousand Burning Flame that is ranked nine on the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 ranking. Is big brother Xiao interested in it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is likely that any human would be interested in it.\u201d Xiao Yan did not hide his interest in the Three Thousand Burning Flame. He smiled and said, \u201cHowever, if this Three Thousand Burning Flame is within the Pill Tower, they would definitely protect such a rare \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 extremely well. It is easier said than done in order to obtain it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian by the side also nodded. He said in a deep voice, \u201cIt is indeed worthy of being the Pill Tower. It even possesses a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 of such ranking. However, it is just as Xiao Yan has said. Even if Xiao Yan could snatch such a rare \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 from their hands, it is likely that he will arouse their enmity. Honestly speaking, the Three Thousand Burning Flame might be rare, but it is not a wise act to offend the Pill Tower over it. After all, the strength that the Pill Tower possesses on the continent is quite great. Even your teacher back then was quite afraid of them despite having not agreed to the invitation from the Pill Tower to join them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Xiao Yan\u2019s face was slightly withdrawn after he heard Su Qian\u2019s words. He did not know much about the Pill Tower. However, he knew that they gathered the top alchemists from the continent. Moreover, it was regarded as a holy ground for all alchemists. They were definitely not some ordinary faction. Forming an enmity with them was not a wise decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, big brother Xiao need not worry about this point. If you are able to bag the Three Thousand Burning Flame, it means that you have the ability to. The Pill Tower will definitely not form an enmity with you because of this.\u201d Xin Lan smiled and softly explained when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s manner. \u201cThis is because the \u2018Three Thousand Burning Flame\u2019 is merely discovered by the Pill Tower but is not subdued by them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cActually, if one were to count in detail, the Pill Tower discovered the Three Thousand Burning Flame quite a while ago. During this period of time, the experts from the Pill Tower naturally attempted to subdue it. However, all of their efforts were futile. Instead, they all ended up with quite the loss when faced with the Three Thousand Burning Flame\u2019s retaliation. Hence, the Pill Tower could only use a sealing method to temporarily seal the Three Thousand Burning Flame. Of course, this kind of seal cannot be maintained forever. After all, that Three Thousand Burning Flame is not some ordinary being.\u201d Xin Lan spread her hands and spoke in a gloating manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly sat back in his chair. His eyes studied Xin Lan and then indicated for her to continue speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter both parties continued in stalemate for a period of time, the Pill Tower had also discovered that forcefully attempting to subdue this Three Thousand Burning Flame, which had already evolved to the point of possessing great intelligence, was really too difficult. Hence, after some discussion, they finally decided to distribute the qualification to subdue the Three Thousand Burning Flame out\u2026\u201d Xin Lan curled her lips and continued to explain.</p><br/><p>\u201cDistribute it out?\u201d Xiao Yan and Su Qian were stunned when they heard this. This Pill Tower was actually willing to allow others to subdue this Three Thousand Burning Flame?</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, there is some limitation to this distribution. Every thirty years, the Dou Qi continent will hold a grand Pill Gathering that possesses the greatest influence within the alchemist world. Naturally, the only faction which has the qualification to hold this Pill Gathering is the Pill Tower\u2026\u201d Xin Lan smiled as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cPill Gathering?\u201d Xiao Yan muttered in his mouth after being startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Pill Gathering could be considered a rarely seen grand affair on the Dou Qi continent. Countless of geniuses from all over the continent will come and give it a try. Those who succeed will naturally be renowned throughout the world. Hehe, I remember that your teacher had obtained a champion spot in a Pill Gathering back then. It was at that time that you teacher had gradually become an extremely great person on the Dou Qi continent.\u201d Su Qian laughed as he explained.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was once again stunned when he heard this. It was unexpected that teacher had participated in this so-called \u2018Pill Gathering\u2019 before\u2026</p><br/><p>Xin Lan by the side was startled when she heard these words. She immediately looked at Xiao Yan with surprise. Having come from the Central Plains, she naturally clearly knew what a champion of a season\u2019s \u2018Pill Gathering\u2019 represented. The three great heads of the Pill Tower were all once the \u2018Pill Gathering\u2019 champion\u2026 she did not expect Xiao Yan\u2019s teacher to be this great. No wonder he was able to obtain such an achievement at such an age\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe so-called distributed qualification is related to this \u2018Pill Gathering\u2019?\u201d Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes and softly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Xin Lan nodded her head. She smiled and said, \u201cAs long as one enters the top ten within the \u2018Pill Gathering,\u2019 one will be given the right to attempt to subdue the Three Thousand Burning Flame on top of the rich reward given by the Pill Tower. Whether one succeeds or not will rely entirely on one\u2019s ability. Therefore, if big brother Xiao Yan is confident in himself, you can go and participate in this \u2018Pill Gathering.\u2019 This is the only official method to obtain the Three Thousand Burning Flame.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly exhaled a breath of air when he heard this. A heated feeling slowly climbed within his heart. Being a young person, his heart possessed the prideful hope of competing with the heroes in the world regardless of how calm he usually was. This was especially the case when it involved the overwhelming allure of the \u2018Three Thousand Burning Flame\u2019...</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Xiao, is my clue worth your guarantee?\u201d Xin Lan smiled slyly and asked him a question when she saw the heat in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth lifted up, the arc slowly widened. A moment later, he laughed loudly and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The only difference is that its intelligence is much higher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that the evolution destroyed its old memories?\u201d Yao Lao was also very confused with regards to this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan stilled for a moment and narrowed his eyes. An unknown meaning flashed from within them as he smiled and said, \u201cShe seems to be interested with something in my ring.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, Xiao Yan\u2019s finger gently tapped on his storage ring. A couple of things appeared on his palm. The small seven-colored snake moved closer. It swept its gaze across and swayed its snake tail while repeatedly shaking its head. Clearly, the thing it wanted was not among these items.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stored the things back into the storage ring. He was not frustrated as he patiently took out more things, one by one, out of the storage ring. A moment later, when he once again took out a small jade bottle that was filled with a purple-colored liquid, the small snake which had curled up in midair immediately appeared at where his palm was as though it had teleported. It extended its small snake tongue into the jade bottle and used took a few ferocious licks.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 Amethyst Lion Birth Essence. I did not expect that what it wanted is this thing.\u201d Eyeing the Amethyst Lion Birth Essence which had swiftly been reduced by nearly a tenth, a painful feeling surfaced on Xiao Yan\u2019s face. However, it appeared that this little creature knew about the power of the Amethyst Essence. It did not greedily absorb any more. After taking a few licks, it pulled its head out. Its crystal clear snake pupils danced with excitement and satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 is also an exotic beast which is of the fire affinity. Naturally, it has a great liking for the Amethyst Essence which is filled with pure fire type energy.\u201d Yao Lao said with a smile as he watched the small seven-colored snake\u2019s excitement.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head and painfully returned the somewhat diminished Amethyst Essence to his storage ring.</p><br/><p>It seemed that since the snake had absorbed the Amethyst Lion Birth Essence, there was less caution within the eyes of the small seven-colored snake as they looked at Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Clearly sensing the change in the small snake\u2019s gaze, Xiao Yan\u2019s heart moved slightly. He carefully extended his hand and gently caressed its small body.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s action, the small seven-colored snake twisted its body. It then gave up avoiding Xiao Yan\u2019s hand, twisted its small head and lazily rubbed itself on Xiao Yan\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Eyeing the action of the small snake that did not have the slightest enmity, an unusual glint in his eyes suddenly grew.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, boy, are you planning to keep this thing by your side?\u201d Seemingly clearly understanding Xiao Yan\u2019s thoughts, Yao Lao\u2019s voice immediately sounded in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe.\u201d Xiao Yan let out two dry chuckles. He licked his lips and said with an excited voice in his heart, \u201cThis is an ancient exotic beast with limitless potential. If I keep it for myself, it won\u2019t lose to me controlling a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 in value.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 is indeed very strong, but the current her is clearly only at a baby stage. Her body does indeed contain an extremely enormous energy, but she must undergo honing for an unknown amount of time before it can completely master it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, you should know that regardless of how docile the \u2018Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 is now, I dare to bet that her original body is definitely that of Queen Medusa. Perhaps, she has now become like this because of some unknown reason but no one can say for certain that she will not suddenly recover her memories in the future. When that time comes\u2026\u201d Yao Lao said gravely, \u201cYou should know very well the arrogance and viciousness of Queen Medusa. For you who dares to take the opportunity of becoming her owner, she might as well butcher you on the spot with her character.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d The palm which was rubbing the small seven-colored snake stiffened. Xiao Yan frowned and mused for a long while. Finally, he sighed gently and whispered, \u201cBut what if she doesn\u2019t regain her memories? The current her is just like a small beast which has just been born. I am also the first person she saw. Regardless of what happens, I think that she should not have too much enmity toward me. Otherwise, she wouldn\u2019t stay by my side looking for food the moment she appeared\u2026 This is an extremely good opportunity\u2026 An ancient exotic beast that may be able to contend with the legendary Dou Sheng in the future. That is a fatal attraction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are gambling\u2026\u201d Yao Lao helplessly sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, what\u2019s wrong with gambling once in a while for an extremely strong bodyguard in the future. If that kind of situation were to occur in the future, isn\u2019t there still Teacher? When that time comes, if we can\u2019t beat her\u2026 then we will flee.\u201d Xiao Yan laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, I hope you will not burn yourself by playing with fire.\u201d Yao Lao said with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled gently and carefully carried the small seven-colored snake with both hands. The small seven-colored snake did not resist his gentle action. It swung its tail and curled around Xiao Yan\u2019s wrist. After which, it swung its body, much like playing on a swing.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle thing, do you want to leave with me?\u201d Putting the small snake in front of him, Xiao Yan said softly as he smiled. That expression was the same expression that many would use for trying to dupe a little girl who was lost by the roadside.</p><br/><p>Opening its purple-colored snake eyes, the small seven-colored snake stared at the young man\u2019s face. An extremely human like feeling of being at a loss flashed across its pupils. It straightened its body and blankly stared at Xiao Yan in this manner.</p><br/><p>Seeing the strange action of the small seven-colored snake, Xiao Yan\u2019s heart pounded. The smile on his face was somewhat embarrassing. He seemed to faintly sense that a matured and haughty spirit within the small seven-colored snake\u2019s body was coldly glaring at his inferior performance.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan coughed lightly, rotated his eyes and tapped his finger on the storage ring. A bottle of Amethyst Lion Birth Essence appeared in his palm. After taking out a small white jade stick, he placed a few drops of Amethyst Essence on it and waved it gently in front of the small seven-colored snake.</p><br/><p>When the Amethyst Essence appeared, the snake eyes of the small seven-colored snake glowed brightly. That human like feeling of loss swiftly disappeared. Opening its mouth, it extended its snake\u2019s tongue toward Xiao Yan much like it was begging for it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee\u2026\u201d Following the small seven-colored snake\u2019s action, the matured and haughty spirit in its body seemed to once again become quiet. Immediately, a smile was lifted from the corner of Xiao yan\u2019s mouth. Regardless of whether Queen Medusa spirit was present or not, the current \u2018Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 at the very least, did not possess the ability to resist the attraction brought about by the Amethyst Essence.</p><br/><p>After Xiao Yan dropped the Amethyst Essence into the small snake\u2019s mouth, the latter smacked its lips with satisfaction. A moment later, the snake\u2019s tail coiled around Xiao Yan\u2019s wrist and then it entered into his sleeves before gradually entering into a deep sleep.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha!\u201d Eyeing the \u2018Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019, Xiao Yan opened his mouth and instantly let out a loud laugh. With the help from the Amethyst Essence, he and the snake had swiftly became close. If this kind of situation continued, Xiao Yan believed that he could turn their relationship into an extremely firm one before she became mature and started possessing a human-like intellect.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently patted his sleeve with his palm. The joy on his face was difficult to conceal. Licking up the little bit of Amethyst Essence on the white jade stick, Xiao Yan allowed the hot energy to surge in his body as he opened his mouth and laughed. Xiao Yan took a few steps forward as he lifted his head to eye the cluster of green-colored flame in midair and smiled. After a few twists and turns, this \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 had finally appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>Although he was extremely anxious in his heart, Xiao Yan did not make any reckless moves. This thing known as a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was like a bomb. If one were not careful, a destructive force would suddenly erupt from it, just like what happened a moment ago. He was not Queen Medusa who may have been able to withstand the force of the flame by a little but if it were him instead, he would be completely turned into nothingness in less than ten seconds.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2026 now, how do we rein it in?\u201d Eyeing the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 in midair with a yearning clearly evident on his face, Xiao Yan hurriedly inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cReining in the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is not very easy. It will incinerate anything that comes close to it into nothingness. This includes energy. Other than some special objects, you can only use a never ending supply of energy to forcefully wrap around it and take it away. I think, Queen Medusa used this method back then.\u201d Yao Lao voiced his thoughts, \u201cBut that method exhausts an extremely large amount of energy. With your current self, you would not be able to move this flame off of this small island even if you let out all the Dou Qi within the vortex.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 then what do we do?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Yan\u2019s expression immediately collapsed as he inquired in a devastated manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, naturally we cannot adopt Queen Medusa\u2019s method. Neither one of us can afford it.\u201d Yao Lao grinned and said, \u201cWhat I have said before applies to others. But you are different, you have a tool that can easily bring the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was at a loss momentarily. He blinked his eyes and a moment later, he suddenly said, \u201cYou are referring to the Green Lotus Lotus\u2019s Seat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, precisely. The Green Lotus Seat and the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 originate from the same source. If you use the seat to carry the flame, not only will it suppress the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 to the lowest temperature such that it will not spill out but it will also be much safer in comparison to using energy to wrap around it.\u201d Yao Lao said with yet another smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head and quickly tapped on the storage ring with his finger. Instantly, a green-colored glow slowly rose from the storage ring and was suspended in front of Xiao Yan. Within the green-colored glow, there was a Green Lotus Seat that was as perfect as a piece of art. It rotated slightly and released a faint energy.</p><br/><p>Pulling the Green Lotus Seat with his hand, Xiao Yan threw it gently over the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 in midair. A faint green-colored glow was emitted from the Green Lotus Seat when it reached the bottom of the flame. Finally, it quietly wrapped around the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the green-colored glow diminished in size, the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 gradually fell into the core of the lotus without any resistance. A strange green-colored flame immediately rose within the empty core of the Lotus.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccess\u2026\u201d The process of obtaining the Heavenly Flame was so smooth that Xiao Yan was surprised. He eyed the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 that had been stored into the Green Lotu Seat with a face that was filled with joy. Xiao Yan carefully held the bottom of the Green Lotus Seat as he stared intently at the cluster of green-colored flame in the middle. An excitement flashed involuntarily in his dark black eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext, hurry and leave this city. Find a quiet place and swallow the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019! Remember, do not store the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 in the storage ring during this period of time. Otherwise, the things inside will be incinerated into nothingness.\u201d Yao Lao warned with a grave voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s body trembled as he nodded his head seriously. The Purple Cloud Wings extended from his back while his hand grabbed an \u2018Energy Recovery Pill\u2019 and stuffed it into his mouth. After which, he gravely raised his head and watched the purple light curtain that was imminently disappearing.</p><br/><p>The purple-colored light curtain flickered and at some point in time, it finally turned into tiny lights that filled the sky after a \u2018bang\u2019.</p><br/><p>When the purple-colored light curtain exploded, Xiao Yan\u2019s feet suddenly and violently pushed off the ground. His body shot to the sky as he carried the Green Lotus Seat, rushing with all his might to get out of the city.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Her anxious gaze swept over the black-robed person and instantly ignored Xiao Yan. Her figure quickly retreated back tens of meters as she coldly watched the group. With cold laughter, she asked, \u201cWhat wind has blown over this desert tonight? When have the rarely seen hermits, start to enjoy forming groups?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, it is really unexpected that we would be able to meet a strong person of the Dou Wang level after just arriving in this vast desert. You should be one of the chiefs from the eight large tribes of the Snake-People, no?\u201d Among the new people, the middle aged man stepped forward and laughed as he stared at Yue Mei in the distance.</p><br/><p>Seated on the sand dune, the shock on Xiao Yan\u2019s face gradually disappeared. He blinked and stealthily swept his gaze over the eight people. He realized that among these eight people, other than that black-robed person, who was so mysterious that one could not see his strength, the others appeared to faintly view the middle aged man as a leader.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he? He could actually get so many strong people to listen to him?\u201d Sensing this situation, astonishment gradually surfaced in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart. It should be known that people who could become a Dou Wang were all well known people. People like them may have different personalities but they all had a similar haughtiness of the strong within their bones. It should be extremely difficult for them to submit to someone of the same level.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shifted his gaze from these few people, finally landed on the smiling middle aged man and roughly appraised him. Xiao Yan had to admit that this middle aged man had a demeanor that was difficult to describe. His distinct, angled face let others know that he must have been an uncommonly handsome man when he was young. He may be slightly older now but he had a mature demeanor honed from the years that added a calmness and a sense of experience.</p><br/><p>This double threat would possess a lethal force toward some younger girls\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person does not seem to be so simple\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan mumbled in his heart. This was the first impression that this handsome middle aged man gave Xiao Yan. Naturally, what person who could become a Dou Wang was simple?</p><br/><p>He shifted his gaze away from the middle aged man and once again stopped on the human figure covered tightly in a black robe. For some unknown reason, Xiao Yan had a faint feeling that ever since the mysterious person in the black robe appeared, the gaze under it seemed to focus on him in an indistinct manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Why have you come to the inner regions of my race\u2019s land in the middle of the night? Don\u2019t you know that humans are forbidden from coming here?\u201d The enchanting smile on Yue Mei\u2019s face had already completely disappeared. Replacing it was a thick serious expression. Clearly, the terrifying line-up that had suddenly appeared in front of her did not give her the leisure to joke around.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, there is something important for us to visit in the Tager Desert. Could you lead the way into the inner regions of the desert to see your tribe\u2019s Queen?\u201d The middle aged man smiled and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to see Her Majesty?\u201d Hearing this, a beautiful and dangerous angle was formed in Yue Mei\u2019s pretty eyes. She said with a cold smile, \u201cOur Snake-People have been enemies with you humans for many years. Each of our hands are stained with the blood of the other side. What is there to discuss? If the few of you know what is good for you, I urge you to quickly leave. Otherwise, once our eight tribe leaders gather, the number of strong people in the Jia Ma Empire will shrink drastically.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld He, I told you that you can forget about adopting a diplomatic stance with the Snake-People. They don\u2019t buy this\u2026\u201d An agile and fierce looking large man in midair lowered his head and shouted to the middle aged man.</p><br/><p>The voice of the large man was like thunder, reverberating through the air. It was a long while later before it gradually weakened and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know this woman. She\u2019s the leader of the Mei Snake Tribe, one of the eight large tribes of the Snake-People. Hee hee. Back then, when Jia Ma Empire started a war with the Snake-People Tribes, that old man Lei Na fought with her and eventually suffered some losses.\u201d The large man\u2019s eyes gazed at Yue Mei\u2019s enchanting body as he said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLei Na? You mean that old man who trained with a Lightning type Qi Method during the war back then? I wonder, has the poison in his body been cured?\u201d A cold smile appeared at the corner of Yue Mei\u2019s mouth as she taunted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks to you, the poison has been cured but one of his hands ended up being crippled.\u201d The large man said bluntly. The eyes he used to glance at Yue Mei held a cold glint.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld He, let\u2019s just take action and capture her. Don\u2019t waste any more time. If we arrive late, the thing that you want may well be gone. Moreover, if she were to escape, the difficulty of our mission might end up increasing significantly.\u201d The large man lowered his head and said to the middle aged man.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the middle aged man being addressed as Old He thought quietly for a while. He nodded his head slightly and helplessly said, \u201cSince you don\u2019t wish to cooperate, then don\u2019t blame us for bullying you with our numbers. Old Shi, Feng Li, I will have to trouble you.\u201d When he finished the last sentence, the middle aged man lifted his head and said to the large man and a somewhat skinny old man in midair.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem. I have long wanted to see just how tenacious the strong people of the Snake-People are.\u201d Hearing the middle aged man\u2019s words, the large man immediately patted his chest and laughed without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>The other skinny old man, on the other hand, hesitated a little. It was obvious that he was arrogant of his position and did not want the two of them to attack together. However, his hesitation only lasted for a brief moment before it was thrown aside. He was clearly aware that this Dou Wang would increase the difficulty of the mission that followed.</p><br/><p>The bodies of the two men trembled and then turned into two black lines that appeared a short distance from Yue Mei. The sudden increase in the speed of their bodies caused the air to unleash an explosive sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan Shi.\u201d Standing on a sand dune, the large man lifted his head and announced his name. This was a small etiquette among the strong people.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng Li\u201d The skinny old man said indifferently.</p><br/><p>Hearing these two names, Xiao Yan\u2019s and Yue Mei\u2019s hearts pounded wildly.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Hu\u2026 these two people are actually the Lion King Yan Shi and Walking Wind Feng Li, renowned throughout the Jia Ma Empire as part of the Ten Strongest in the empire?\u201d Staring at the figures of the large man and the skinny man with a stunned expression, Xiao Yan involuntarily inhaled a breath of cool air. Usually, it would be difficult to see these strong people who were far above him. However, on this night, he was actually able to see two of them at once\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI wondered who had the courage to charge into the inner regions of my tribe. It\u2019s actually two people of the Ten Strongest from the Jia Ma Empire\u2026\u201d The words were mocking as she softly and coldly laughed. Yue Mei\u2019s pretty face was becoming increasingly grave. Although she had not fought with these two before, she had heard of their names. They were not useless individuals who possessed great fame. These two people naturally had their extraordinary points in order to become part of the Ten Strongest of the Jia Ma Empire.</p><br/><p>With Yue Mei\u2019s strength, she would not be too afraid of fighting with any one of them. However, if she had to fight the two of them alone, that would be a little more difficult. Moreover, other than these two, the black-robed person who had been silent was the one who Yue Mei was most afraid of. Dou Huang\u2026 that was an extremely strong person that only Her Majesty could match.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy have these people suddenly gathered here in the desert? Something terrible must have happened for something unusual like this to occur. Regardless of their motives, I must pass this information to Her Majesty. Otherwise, with their line-up, there is not one among our eight large tribes who could fight them alone.\u201d This thought flashed quickly in Yue Mei\u2019s heart. Without any hesitation or saying any nonsense, her hand swiftly formed a strange seal. At the same time, her snake tail gently patted the sand\u2019s surface. Following a soft muffled sound, the calm sand dune suddenly exploded. An enormous sand wave formed in front of Yue Mei in the blink of an eye and smashed toward the others from all directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo it!\u201d Seeing that Yue Mei was first to act, Yan Shi did not bother being polite. He shouted softly, lifted his head, opened his two hands and a faint silver substance like a lion\u2019s roar sound wave was suddenly released from his wide open mouth.</p><br/><p>The sound wave ruthlessly smashed into the violent sand wave; in a flash, the sand froze in midair, finally dropping without strength.</p><br/><p>After Yan Shi overcame the sand wave, Feng Li beside him trembled and suddenly disappeared. A moment later, ferocious energy ripples were emitted from behind the sand wave.</p><br/><p>After overcoming the sand wave attack from the other side, Yao Shi also adopted a rude and unreasonable role as he charged violently into the battle a short distance away. Instantly, enormous gullies that were over tens of meters long continued to appear as forces shot out.</p><br/><p>While the sky was filled with dancing yellow sand, Yue Mei\u2019s pretty face was filled with a cold expression. From the middle of her palm, two quiet green energy silks agglomerated into huge green serpents. The green serpents this time around were obviously not the small snakes that Xiao Yan had seen before. These two huge green serpents were covered with thick scales and their sharp white fangs flashed each time they opened their mouths. The most frightening thing was that these green colored serpents seemed to possess a lifeforce. Two faint fierce Qis were released from their bodies. As they strangely pranced and twisted, they managed to barely hold against Yan Shi and Feng Li.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a frightening thing\u2026 just these strange energy serpents that have been agglomerated have the strength of a Dou Ling.\u201d Seeing that the two huge green energy serpents managed to block two Dou Wangs attacks by prancing and twisting, Xiao Yan could not help but twitch his mouth repeatedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have long heard that some of the strong people in the Snake-People race are able to remove the souls of a Magic Beast and train them into a unique ability. Upon succeeding in training this ability, one would be able to preserve the Magic Beasts original strength. These beasts would also be unafraid of death under the control of their owners. It is exceedingly troublesome fighting them. Seeing it for myself today, I must say that the rumors are really true.\u201d Seeing the dancing yellow sand and the energy surging battlefield, the middle aged man sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder, looks like the two sirs won\u2019t be able to immediately handle it. Do you need us to attack?\u201d A man got closer to the middle aged man and respectfully said.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the middle aged man tilted his head and stared at that mysterious person who was entirely covered by a black robe.</p><br/><p>Seemingly having sensed his gaze, the black-robed person shook his head. The pair of eyes under the black colored hood once again glanced at the young man on a sand dune not far away whose face was filled with shock at the intense battle. There was an unknown meaning behind his gaze.</p><br/><p>Seeing the black-robed person\u2019s action, the middle aged man nodded slightly. He mused for awhile and whispered, \u201cForget it, with Old Shi and Feng Li\u2019s strength, she\u2019s only barely managing to hold out. After a short while, victory will be determined.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes sir!\u201d After giving a respectful reply, this Dou Ling male, who had once dominated the title of the strongest in a large city, swept his gaze with reverence across the black-robed person standing to the side. He then slowly stepped back.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Appearing to have heard the sound of footsteps, some of them lifted their head and swept their gazes toward the young man who was carrying a huge black ruler on his back that seemed to be almost dragging him to the ground. After confusion flashed in their eyes, they began to once again bury themselves in their work. They did not think that anyone had the courage to create a disturbance in the Alchemist Association.</p><br/><p>Standing in the somewhat deserted large hall, Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. He was about to find someone to inquire about the procedure for obtaining an Alchemist tier badge when a young lady in a pale green dress hurriedly came from behind a counter and swiftly strided toward Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 mister, seeing your unfamiliar face, this should be your first time coming to our Black Rock City\u2019s Alchemist Association, no?\u201d She quickly walked to the front of Xiao Yan with a smile, the green clad lady\u2019s eyes completely scanned Xiao Yan before she asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan sized up the lady in green. Her beautiful bright eyes and white teeth were quite lovable. Xiao Yan smiled and said, \u201cIt is indeed my first time. I hope to obtain an Alchemist Tier Badge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? You are also an alchemist?\u201d Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words, the green clad lady was obviously startled. Her beautiful eyes swept over Xiao Yan as she spoke in a stunned voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, can you please tell me what procedures there are?\u201d Without taking the shock in the lady\u2019s eyes to heart, Xiao Yan smiled and nodded,</p><br/><p>\u201cThis way please.\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan nod his head in acknowledgement, the lady in green appeared slightly discomposed. Her pretty face was clearly more respectful as she took a few steps back and came to the front of a counter while smiling at Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>From the counter, green clad lady took out a pale yellow ancient looking parchment made of goat skin. Then her hand elegantly held a pen brush and raised her head. She gave Xiao Yan a full smile. \u201cSir, please tell me your name, age and teacher\u2019s name. I need to register for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, nineteen, teacher\u2026 Yao Lao.\u201d Xiao Yan thought quietly for a while before replying with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister is really young and promising.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she heard Xiao Yan\u2019s age, Ya Han could not help but sigh with shock in her heart. She smiled as she flattered him. Her eyebrows suddenly creased together as she paused the pen brush in her hands. After thinking for a long time, she embarrassingly said, \u201cSir, your teacher\u2019s name does not appear to be in the records of our Alchemist Association.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe likes to live in isolation so he has never come to register. Why? Do I need him to be in the record for me to get the badge? If that\u2019s the case, then let\u2019s forget about it.\u201d Xiao Yan frowned and shook his head. He turned around and prepared to leave; it was unexpected to him that the process was so troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, please wait.\u201d Seeing that Xiao Yan was about to leave, Ya Han hurriedly said, \u201cAlthough your teacher isn\u2019t in the record, if you manage to pass the test, you can still obtain a tier badge.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan finally paused his footsteps and let out a sigh of relief in his heart. He turned around and smiled at Ya Han.</p><br/><p>After quickly tidying up the things on the table, Ya Han held Xiao Yan\u2019s registration form in her hand and gestured with her other hand to lead the way as she said, \u201cSir, please follow me. If you pass the test for a tier, you will be able to successfully obtain a badge for that tier. Ah\u2026 you should be here to take the test for the first tier alchemist, aren\u2019t you?\u201d Ya Han\u2019s delicate hand flipped through the information that Xiao Yan gave as she randomly asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. Tier two.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head and softly replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>Ya Han\u2019s footsteps suddenly paused, causing Xiao Yan to nearly knock into her body which had come to an abrupt stop. However, it was fortunate that he stopped in time. Immediately, he doubtfully eyed the gentle and beautiful figure of Ya Han in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said\u2026 You are here to take the test for a tier two alchemist?\u201d Turning her head, Ya Han widened her small, moist, red mouth. She stared at Xiao Yan with shock. Nineteen years old and he wants to take the test for a tier two alchemist? This was a first in the Alchemist Association of the Jia Ma Empire!</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, are there any problems?\u201d Xiao Yan nodded as he asked faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026 not at all.\u201d Recovering, Ya Han quickly shook her head. The respectfulness in the gaze she gave Xiao Yan grew as she softly said, \u201cMister Xiao Yan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust call me Xiao Yan.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head as he interrupted with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, alright.\u201d After working in the Alchemist Association for some time and coming across quite a number of big shots, Ya Han wasn\u2019t one to use extra courtesies. Hence, hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words, she also saved the mouthful of an address. With a smile she inquired, \u201cYou have never received an alchemist badge before, have you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it is like this, you must first take the test for the tier one alchemist. Only if you are successfully promoted, can you continue to take the test for a tier two alchemist.\u201d Ya Han smiled as she explained the procedure of the test to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then I\u2019ll take them one at a time.\u201d Hearing the explanation, Xiao Yan was a little startled before he helplessly nodded.</p><br/><p>The smiling Ya Fei gradually slowed. A moment later, she stopped in front of a huge door. Outside there were four large and fierce men who were fully armed and guarding it.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes swept across the chest of the four burly men, he felt a slight awe in his heart. He realized that these four men were all nine star Dou Zhes. Moreover, from the long and steady breathing of one of them, it was obvious that he had stayed at the level for a long time. Seeing the occasional glint that appeared in his eyes, it appeared that he would soon enter the grade of a Dou Shi.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Te Ya, has the examination inside started?\u201d Ya Han handed over Xiao Yan\u2019s information in her hand to the strongest man as she smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, not yet, but it would soon start. Have you brought another new person here? Looks like he\u2019s quite good.\u201d The one who was addressed as Te Ya swept his gaze on Xiao Yan\u2019s body and felt a surprise rise in his heart. With his strength, he actually failed to see the true strength of the young man in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, alright. Let\u2019s go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>After carefully studying the information and stamp on the registration form, Te Ya finally took out a black armband. On the armband was the number \u20185\u2019 written in a large font. \u201cThis is your testing number. Don\u2019t lose it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After receiving the armband, Xiao Yan wrapped it around his arm and smiled as he thanked Te Ya.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, you will have to go in by yourself. According to regulations, we cannot carelessly walk into the room.\u201d Seeing that the administrative procedure had completed, Ya Han said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, thank you very much!\u201d Xiao Yan nodded his head while smiling. He then cupped his hands together before stepping up to open the large door. The spacious large hall was so brightly lit that it appeared like it was daytime. There were quite a number of people clustered in the hall and many whispers and laughter would occasionally appear in the hall.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze swept across the chest area of these people and was surprised to find that most of them were true alchemists.</p><br/><p>Among the crowd, Xiao Yan had also found two Tier Four alchemists. One of them was Grandmaster Ao Tuo whom Xiao Yan had seen earlier. The other was also an elderly person. Hearing the way the surrounding people addressed him, Xiao Yan realised that this old man was the chairman of the Black Rock City Alchemist Association, Fu Lan Ke.</p><br/><p>At the center of the hall, there were over ten meticulously arranged stone tables that were separated from each other. On the stone tables, many different instruments for refining medicine were neatly placed. At this moment, around seven or eight anxious young people were at these stone tables; the girl called Lin Fei was incidentally among them.</p><br/><p>\u201cFu Lan Ke, where is Xue Mei? Why has she not appeared? The examination is about to start!\u201d Ao Tuo swept his eyes toward the hourglass on the table before tilting his head as he asked Fu Lan Ke beside him who was chatting with someone else.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry. This is Xue Mei\u2019s first test. Naturally she wants to be completely prepared.\u201d Waving his hand, Fu Lan Ke eyed the impatiently waiting Ao Tuo, a smile appearing on his old face.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ao Tuo curled his lips and snorted, \u201cThere\u2019s still ten minutes. If she\u2019s still not here, you cannot delay the start of the examination for her, even if you are the chairman.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a smile, Fu Lan Ke turned his head and swept his gaze across the large hall. Finally, he paused and stared at the young man who had unknowingly arrived. After glancing at the armband on his arm, Fu Lan Ke involuntarily asked in a surprised voice, \u201cKid, are you also here to take the alchemist test?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing so many people in the same occupation for the first time, Xiao Yan was a little excited. When he heard Fu Lan Ke\u2019s question, he was a little surprised but he quickly nodded his head.</p><br/><p>When he saw Xiao Yan nodding his head, Fu Lan Ke\u2019s eyes were filled with even greater amazement. He asked with a smile, \u201cHow old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNineteen.\u201d Not understanding what this person, who obviously held a high position, was thinking, Xiao Yan could only answer honestly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Having heard Xiao Yan\u2019s answer, not only did Fu Lan Ke let out a shocked sound, even Ao Tuo also turned his gaze over. When he noticed Xiao Yan, he was momentarily stunned. An instant later, he laughed, \u201cI said that I felt something different from this kid before. So you\u2019re actually an alchemist. But why did I not feel it just now? Normally, it should be very difficult for someone who is weaker than me to hide their identity.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Ao Tuo words, Xiao Yan could only display a loose face and shook his head pretending not to understand. With Yao Lao\u2019s protection, how could a tier four alchemist discover the true extent of Xiao Yan\u2019s alchemy abilities? Luckily, Ao Tuo did not attempt to get to the bottom of the matter. When he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s ignorant manner, he ceased his questioning.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk. Nineteen? Old Ao Tuo, this young man\u2019s age is quite a bit younger than both of our disciples.\u201d Fu Lan Ke praised while clicking his tongue.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should praise him after he successfully passes. Although these words may sound mocking but two years ago didn\u2019t Lin Fei come and take the test when she was nineteen?\u201d Ao Tuo said as he shook his head. He did not have any intention of looking down on Xiao Yan but attempting to get an alchemist badge at the age of nineteen was something that had never happened in the Alchemist Association of Black Rock City.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat girl of yours was here to purely create trouble. The her then nearly caused the medicinal furnace to explode.\u201d Fu Lan Ke shook his head as he scolded with a smile. Although he had said those words just now, he also understood that taking the Alchemist test at nineteen was difficult.</p><br/><p>After all, in order to become a true Alchemist, other than having innate Spiritual Perception, one must become a true Dou Zhe. Additionally, after becoming a Dou Zhe, one must begin to learn about the art of alchemy under the close guidance of a teacher. This step would require at least a year of time!</p><br/><p>In summary, for a nineteen year old to become a tier one alchemist, he must become a Dou Zhe at eighteen or even seventeen. This kind of terrifying training talent may be even more rare when compared to the uncommon Spiritual Perception that an alchemist required.</p><br/><p>Hence, even though Fu Lan Ke had vast experience, it was difficult for him to imagine the young man in front of him would successfully pass the test.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease. Don\u2019t think that I don\u2019t know about the time that you privately gave Xue Mei an alchemy test where she also blew up the medicinal cauldon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the two old men who were exposing each other\u2019s secrets, Xiao Yan could only helplessly shake his head. He was about to open his mouth to inquire when a faint voice that was slightly icy suddenly sounded from behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, I\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m late,\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden icy but lovely voice was like the clear sound of snow rocks on a snow mountain tapping on one another, unleashing an extremely moving sound. At the very least, after the voice sounded, Xiao Yan found that over half of the young men in the hall turned their slightly heated gazes toward the area behind Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan pursed his lips as he slowly turned around curiously to watch a lady in a silver dress elegantly walk in from the huge doorway. His eyebrows straightened as an obscure amazement flashed across his gaze.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

These two people were quite well-known. One was the third commander of the Gu clan\u2019s Black Submerged Army while the other was the Pill Gathering champion. The both of them were outstanding people within the younger generation. Could the observers be lucky enough to watch them spar here today?</p><br/><p>Excitement surged in quite a number of people\u2019s eyes when they thought of this. Their gazes swept around them in an attempt to find the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s group was also startled because of this sudden unexpected change. They saw Xiao Yan\u2019s gloomy expression and immediately understood something. They frowned and said, \u201cIt is unexpected that trouble has come knocking on the door after having just talked about it. This is really a little too underhanded.\u201d</p><br/><p>With their intelligence, they naturally understood that the other party was afraid of Xiao Yan backing away, explaining why he had publicly acted before seeking permission. If Xiao Yan were to lose this match, it was likely that it would become an excuse for the Gu clan to strike against Xiao Yan. Even Xun Er would be implicated by this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression was gloomy. He slowly exhaled a breath of air and gradually placed his teacup down. He softly said, \u201cIt\u2019s just as well. I do not like this kind of continuous trouble. It will not be bad if I kill a chicken to warn those monkeys before entering the Gu clan. Since he willingly wishes to become this chicken, I shall accept his offer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan suddenly turned his head after uttering these words. His icy gaze shot to the green-clothed man on the upper floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, his senses are quite sharp\u2026\u201d That green-clothed man laughed when he saw Xiao Yan looking over. His expression did not reveal the slightest fear. His strength was at the peak of the five star Dou Zun class. Although Xiao Yan was also a five star Dou Zun, this green-clothed young man had seldom been defeated when fighting an opponent of the same level.</p><br/><p>\u201cYang Hao, you should not act recklessly. If the Elders become aware of this\u2026\u201d The fifth commander by the side frowned as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are only sparing. Our Gu clan has always been more inclined to fight. Isn\u2019t it good to find friends through sparing?\u201d Yang Hao laughed faintly and continued, \u201cRelax, I will not allow him to lose in an ugly way\u2026 of course this is only if he is tactful.\u201d</p><br/><p>After his words softly sounded, Yang Hao\u2019s body flashed, and he appeared on the stone stage before the fifth commander could say anything more. He smiled as he looked in the direction of Xiao Yan. He laughed and said, \u201cMister Xiao Yan, I have long heard of your great name. May I know if I can seek some lessons from you today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Swoosh!</p><br/><p>All the gazes in the building suddenly turned at this moment. They gathered on the skinny figure beside a window.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is that Xiao Yan? The Pill Gathering champion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe looks quite young. It is unexpected that he has reached the level of a tier 8 alchemist at such an age. It is really difficult to believe.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is rumored that his teacher is Yao Chen, Yao zun-zhe from back then. However, the current Yao Chen has already advanced to a Ban Sheng. His strength is so great that it is frightening\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder\u2026 Yao Chen has sharp eyes. This current disciple is many times stronger than Han Feng from back then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression was calm as he heard the private conversations around him. He turned his head and threw his eyes at the young green-clothed man on the stage with a dark smile on his face. He slowly stood up and said, \u201cSince third commander insists on this, I shall not reject your offer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Hao\u2019s brows were lifted slightly when he saw that Xiao Yan did not find an excuse to reject him. However, the smile on his face became denser. He did an \u2018after you\u2019 gesture. However, no one saw the dense chill flashing through his eyes when he bowed to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s group did not stop him. They were confident in Xiao Yan\u2019s strength. That Yang Hao\u2019s strength might be at the peak of a five star Dou Zun, but this kind of strength did not pose any fatal threat to the current Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. He strode forward and the space in front of him became distorted. The next moment, he appeared a short distance away from Yang Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are indeed worthy of being the champion of a Pill Gathering. This courage is really admirable.\u201d Yang Hao grinned as he looked at Xiao Yan and complimented him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was calm as he glanced at the superficial smile on Yang Hao\u2019s face. His voice tranquil, to the extent of lacking emotion, \u201cAfter you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Hao loudly laughed. He suddenly took a step forward. A vast and mighty Dou Qi immediately surged in all directions. The powerful Dou Qi pressure caused the expressions of quite a number of people within the building to change.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, this commander shall personally test and see just how outstanding this Pill Gathering champion is!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Hao loudly laughed as his Dou Qi surged. His long hand was suddenly clenched, and a sharp wind was formed within his palm. His foot stomped on the ground, and his body appeared in front of Xiao Yan with lightning-like speed. A sharp claw wind violently rushed toward Xiao Yan like a dragnet. The sharp force tore through space, forming numerous dark black scars.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stepped back when faced with Yang Hao\u2019s ferocious attack. He began to use a mysterious footwork within a three step radius and dodged Yang Hao\u2019s dense claw wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a fast speed. However, come and try my Dragon Snake Footwork!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Hao was startled when he saw Xiao Yan completely dodge his attack. He immediately let out a cold cry. He took a step forward. With the step of a dragon and tiger, his body became ghost-like and a dragon-snake illusory figure vaguely appeared behind him. The Gu clan did not lack high class Dou Skills. Moreover, being the third commander, the Dou Skills that Yang Hao had learned were definitely not ordinary. This Dragon Snake Footwork alone was not inferior to Xiao Yan\u2019s Three Thousand Lightning Movement.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSky Evil Qi Shattering Claw!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Hao\u2019s speed suddenly increased after using this Dragon Snake Footwork. His claw wind suddenly changed as a fierce evil aura quickly gathered on his palm. The space where his palm passed cracked apart, and a deafening buzzing sound spread in a sharp manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Gu clan is indeed a large clan. These high class Dou Skills that are difficult to see in the outside world are being used as he pleases!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes narrowed when he sensed that Yang Hao\u2019s speed and attack had suddenly become sharper. By possessing so many high class Dou Skills to protect himself with, it was little wonder that this fellow was not worried about defeating Xiao Yan, who was also a five star Dou Zun. However, he had miscalculated. In front of Xiao Yan, who possessed an unusually powerful Spiritual Strength, any ghost-like agility techniques could not escape his eyes!</p><br/><p>\u201cBam bam!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved his sleeve and would accurately strike Yang Hao\u2019s claw wind just when it was about to reach its target. This moment was coincidentally the moment when the claw wind was going from weak to strong. However, one would be unable to take advantage of such an opening without a perfect observation ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Hao\u2019s expression gained a solemness each time they exchanged blows. After over a dozen sharp exchanges, his expression had been replaced by a grave one. Although he had used two types of Di class middle level Dou Skills, he was unable to harm Xiao Yan. Xiao Yan\u2019s movements of leisure caused him to feel that he was losing face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not believe that a poor brat like you can compete with this commander in terms of the amount and quality of skills that you possess!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Hao\u2019s expression was dark and cold. His feet suddenly pulled back. At the same time, his hands started to form numerous seals that Xiao Yan was unusually familiar with.</p><br/><p>\u201cGod Seal Skill, huh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes when he saw the seals. His body flashed and strangely appeared in front of Yang Hao. He flicked his finger and a gentle breeze shot out, striking Yang Hao\u2019s wrist with lightning-like speed. This breeze might not be strong, but it interrupted the completion of the God Seal Skill, causing the blood within Yang Hao\u2019s body to churn.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis brat. Why is he aware of the flaws of the God Seal Skill?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Hao\u2019s expression changed when Xiao Yan randomly broke the seal that he had been forming. Before he could think, a hot wind came blew over, and he had to hurriedly receive it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hot wind spread across the stone stage. Everyone was stunned to see Yang Hao stagger a couple of steps back because of Xiao Yan\u2019s punch. Yang Hao was in a situation where Xiao Yan had completely overwhelmed him.</p><br/><p>The originally dark and cold face of Ling Quan on the upper floor had become a little ugly. He vaguely began to feel an unease growing.</p><br/><p>\u201cYang Hao is no match for him!\u201d The fifth commander also displayed a serious expression. Xiao Yan appeared unruffled even in the face of Yang Hao\u2019s skills, causing him to involuntarily feel a little slump in his heart. This fellow was indeed not a mediocre person by being able to catch the eye of young miss\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Hao\u2019s face became flushed red after being forced back by Xiao Yan\u2019s palm. Clearly, he did not understand why he was unable to defeat Xiao Yan with his strength at the peak of the five star Dou Zun class. Moreover, he had even used many powerful Dou Skills. On the other hand, Xiao Yan had yet to use one Dou Skill even until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cOverturning Land Seal!\u201d</p><br/><p>A ferociousness vaguely surfaced on Yang Hao\u2019s face. He unleashed his Dragon Snake Footwork to its limit. A dragon-snake illusory figure appeared on the stone stage while the seal on his hand was swiftly formed. A vast and mighty Dou Qi quickly gathered.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stood on the stage with his hands behind him. His eyes were calm as he watched the blurry figure that was swiftly shuffling around before slowly shutting his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuccessful formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ferocious on Yang Hao\u2019s face became even more intense when he saw what Xiao Yan was doing. His hand seals suddenly paused. A cold expression surfaced from within his eyes. However, a chill covered his heart when the seal in his hand was about to launch toward Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the chill appeared, the stone stage under his feet suddenly cracked apart. A hot magma pillar bared its claws and rushed out like a fire dragon. It smashed into Yang Hao\u2019s legs.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug!\u201d</p><br/><p>The attack that was unleashed from underground had exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations. Being the main actor, Yang Hao spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, and his body was struck by the fire pillar until he flew. Finally, he smashed into a large stone pillar of the building. The stone pillar was immediately blasted apart.</p><br/><p>The entire place was completely silent as everyone watched this battle end in an instant. Numerous stunned eyes looked at the skinny young man with his hands behind him. His body had not even shifted. A moment later, a thunder-like applause resonated through the entire building in a deafening manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression remained tranquil. He studied the charred-black Yang Hao before cupping his hands together. He smiled and said, \u201cThank you for going easy, third commander.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yang Hao, who had just landed on the ground, involuntarily spat out another mouthful of fresh blood. He had never expected to be miserably defeated by Xiao Yan\u2019s hands with his peak of a five star Dou Zun strength\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He also stretched his lazy waist and smiled as he said to Medusa, \u201cLet\u2019s go. It\u2019s time to return.\u201d</p><br/><p>Medusa knit her brows and said, \u201cCan she be trusted? If we charge in during the day that we attack and end up being surrounded by them, the ending\u2026 the current Jia Ma Empire and the Snake-People rely on the both of us. If any mishap were to happen, you should know what the consequences would be for the Yan Alliance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression became somewhat solemn when he heard these words of Medusa. A moment later, he nodded slightly and spoke in a deep voice, \u201cI trust her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hope that you aren\u2019t be wrong about her.\u201d Medusa softly snorted. Her gaze immediately flickered. She hesitated for a moment before saying, \u201cYou should come with me to the Snake-People Tribe tomorrow. A couple of our tribe\u2019s Elders wish to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMeet me?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled as he asked, \u201cWhat for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Medusa\u2019s face was somewhat unusual. It was tilted to the side as she said, \u201cThe Elders within the tribe possess some secret method to easily probe into another person\u2019s body. I\u2026 the matter of me not being a virgin is something that they are already aware of.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan faintly opened his mouth. His face immediately revealed an embarrassed expression as he rubbed his head. His mouth emitted a dry laugh. It was a long while later before he carefully asked, \u201cThen\u2026 what do they plan to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Medusa\u2019s heart involuntarily smiled when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s expression. Her face, however, was still ice-cold as she said faintly, \u201cAccording to the rules of our clan, you will suffer from being swallowed by tens of thousands of snakes\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan trembled in a cold, violent manner when he heard the whatever \u2018swallowed by tens of thousands of snakes\u2019. He dryly laughed, \u201cCan\u2019t everyone have a nice conversation? Must you use these things? I am currently the chief of the Yan Alliance, *cough*, doing those things to me would definitely strain the relationship between the Snake-People Tribe and the Jia Ma Empire. This is not good for anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can go and tell the Elders.\u201d Medusa lifted her eyes as she calmly replied.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan held his forehead and emitted a painful moan. His heart quietly said that something troublesome had indeed arrived.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will come and look for you tomorrow\u2026\u201d Medusa ignored Xiao Yan\u2019s pained manner. She turned her body and slowly walked to the bottom of the hill. Her footsteps suddenly paused. She hesitated for a moment before speaking, \u201cThere is no need for you to remember that whatever \u2018Soul Recovery Pill\u2019. The influence that the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 has on me is already becoming increasingly weaker.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going to kill me?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He immediately questioned in a stunned manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this Queen wished to kill you, you would have already died an unknown number of times during this year.\u201d Medusa coldly snorted.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan awkwardly smiled but his heart sighed in relief. This time bomb beside him seemed to began showing traces of weakening. He finally no longer need to be on tenterhooks all day like in the past. Moreover, no matter what had happened in the past, he at the very least had Yao Lao who could warn him. However, now Yao Lao was captured. If Medusa still held the same thoughts as she did back then, it was likely that he would really be quietly finished off without anyone knowing.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, do not use anything as an excuse tomorrow. Otherwise\u2026\u201d Medusa left behind some words that contained a threat. After which, her body moved and she slowly disappeared in the dark night sky.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan widened his mouth as he stared at the spot Medusa had disappeared from. He slumped and sighed a moment later. Immediately, he clenched his teeth and said, \u201cFine, I will just go. I don\u2019t believe that all of you will really kill me\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan suddenly felt guilty before he had spoken until the end. He quietly spoke in his heart, \u201cHowever, for safety\u2019s sake, I should still call Old Hai, Jia Lao, and the others\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan finally sighed in relief after he had made this decision in his heart. He summoned the fire wings before flying to the Black Mountain Fortress.</p><br/><p>Although the three army alliance had already withdrawn, the defenses of the Black Mountain Fortress were still extremely tight. After all, no one knew whether the three army alliance would return again. Hence, the atmosphere in this place was still extremely tense and solemn despite the jubilation within the interior of the empire.</p><br/><p>The Meeting Room of the Black Mountain Fortress on the next day.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ding and the others were greatly surprised when they heard that Xiao Yan intended to head to the border of the Chu Yun Empire to assassinate the three Mulan Elders and Yan Luo Tian. This plan was quite risky.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this is a trap that they set up for us, it is likely that the fate of you and Medusa will be quite poor. Should mishap happen to the two of you, the three army alliance will definitely attack again!\u201d Xiao Ding spoke in a solemn manner.</p><br/><p>Hai Bodong and the others by his side nodded with solemn faces. This matter was too risky.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I do not do this, Yan Luo Tian and the three Mulan Elders will once again gather all the essence strength within their sects after they fully recover from their injuries. After that, they will be an extremely great trouble. The strength of a Dou Zong is far too strong. Now that we have already formed enmity, we would have to pay quite a hefty price if they decided to take revenge on us in the future. Hence, now is the best time for us to eliminate the grass from its roots.\u201d Xiao Yan slowly said. His eyes swept over the entire hall as he smiled and said, \u201cWhat plan does not have a risk? Moreover, especially when it is something as big as this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ding and the others could only sigh when they heard Xiao Yan\u2019s instance. However, they were also clearly aware that despite the great risk that this plan carried, the danger of the Yan Alliance and the Jia Ma Empire would be completely eliminated once it succeeded!</p><br/><p>This kind of method was one with the greatest assurance!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really think that the leader of the Poison Sect can be trusted?\u201d Xiao Ding\u2019s finger vaguely moved over the surface of the table. He asked a question in a deep voice a moment later.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, she can be trusted. This war is originally just a misunderstanding. If I had been in the Yan Alliance, this war might not have even started.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you insist on doing this\u2026 we will do as you say. On the day you act, the Yan Alliance experts will also be maneuvered and will hide in the surroundings of that city. Once any unexpected changes occur, we will immediately launch a rescue.\u201d Xiao Ding had already known that Xiao Yan was resolute after hearing those words. All he could do was to nod as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled when he heard his brother\u2019s response. He looked at the somewhat serious atmosphere of the hall and laughed, \u201cThere is no need for everyone to act like this. We will not be restricted by anyone once our Yan Alliance develops in the future. However, we have to take some risks now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone could only smile when they heard his words. However, the worry in their heart was not reduced by much.</p><br/><p>A faint voice was transmitted from the side while Xiao Yan stealthily left the Meeting Room.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. I have waited for quite awhile.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s body immediately stiffened when he heard this voice. He turned his head with great difficulty only to see that Medusa was leaning against a stone fence outside of the Meeting Room. She stood in a lazy manner while those bewitching eyes watched him indifferently.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out a dry cough. His face revealed a grin but it was extremely forceful. After which, he unwillingly walked toward Medusa.</p><br/><p>Hai Bodong and Jia Xing Tian coincidentally walked out of the hall just as Xiao Yan approached Medusa. The two of them were startled when they saw this but immediately smiled and greeted them.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan immediately rejoiced upon seeing the two of them He was just about to open his mouth to speak when Medusa, by his side, told them off in an icy-cold voice, \u201cXiao Yan and I have some matters to deal with. There is no need for the two of you to follow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hai Bodong and Jia Xing Tian were stunned when they heard this. They immediately looked at each other before letting out dry laughter. After which, they threw Xiao Yan a gaze that suggested he should fend for himself before quickly fleeing.</p><br/><p>As he watched these two old fellows, who had fled faster than a rabbit could, in a speechless manner, Xiao Yan could only resign to his fate and shake his head. He turned his head to Medusa and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I want to see just what your Elders can do to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint smile surfaced on the corner of Medusa\u2019s mouth when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s manner, which appeared to be somewhat like he was about to die. She turned around and lead the way in front with a steady pace. Xiao Yan followed behind with a bitter expression.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan could not be blamed for dragging his feet. The matter between him and Medusa might not have been within his control, but he had ultimately took the other person\u2019s body. This was the truth. Heading to meet the Elders in the clan was similar to meeting the other party\u2019s parents.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan followed Medusa as they passed through a couple of spacious streets. After around ten plus minutes, they gradually turned into a somewhat darker region. This place was coincidentally the corner of the city. The shadows formed from the towering city walls caused this place to be a little darker. The many experts from the Snake-People Tribe stayed in this place.</p><br/><p>There was a boundary line that was placed at the intersection between this place and the outside world. The Snake-People Tribe might currently be in an alliance with the Jia Ma Empire, but most of the Snake-People were still quite resistant to humans. Hence, it required quite some time in order for them to gradually mill their differences and live peacefully alongside each other.</p><br/><p>This area where the Snake-People Tribe lived was tightly defended. Snake-People who held weapons in their hands repeatedly patrolled to and fro.When they saw Medusa\u2019s body, these guards would immediately pause their bodies and reveal a wild fire in their eyes. After which, they would bow and greet her.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and Medusa passed by them. It was a long while later before they stopped in front of a large compound. Medusa waved her hand and the door to the compound automatically opened. She entered. Xiao Yan hesitated a little before following.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s foot had just stepped into the compound when an enormous dark shadow suddenly came smashing over in a ruthless manner while containing a ferocious wind.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face changed as he sensed that sudden attack. He immediately let out a cold snort as he tightened his fist. The jade-green flame swiftly surged out and smashed toward the person who had unceremoniously launched a sneak attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>A low, deep wind expanded in the courtyard, shaking dust on the ground until it began to spread out like an air wave.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shoulders trembled after exchanging a blow. The person who launched a sneak attack flipped a couple of times through air before crashing to the ground.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly raised his head. His eyes were somewhat icy-cold as he swept over the person who had launched a sneak attack. His eyes immediately narrowed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Xiao Yan had obviously not overcome his shock: did he really think that this green lotus could be directly cut off?</p><br/><p>Yao Lao let out a sigh. He waved his palm and a suction force stilled Xiao Yan\u2019s body just above the green lotus before pulling him back and throwing him by Yao Lao\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>\u201cFool.\u201d Tilting his head and seeing that Xiao Yan was staring at him in an confused manner, Yao Lao laughed bitterly and took out a metal sword from the storage ring. After which, he randomly threw it at the green lotus.</p><br/><p>When the metal sword was about to reach somewhere above the green lotus, a pale-green colored flame suddenly spat out from the green lotus. The metal sword was burnt into a writhing liquid in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Observing this scene, cold sweat appeared on Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead. He swallowed his saliva and smiled awkwardly at Yao Lao.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis green lotus is the pride of nature. Any ordinary metal that touches it will promptly melt. If you want to cut it open, you must use pure jade tools in order to avoid tarnishing it.\u201d Yao Lao faintly said. Immediately, he took out over ten higher grade rouge jade bottles. A thick white flame appeared from his palm and melted these small jade bottles into a pale green liquid. The liquid writhed and finally solidified into a long jade ruler.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao carefully removed the impurities in the jade ruler, causing it to appear crystal clear and as beautiful as the green lotus leaves.</p><br/><p>\u201cUse this jade ruler to cut at the spot where the lotus is connected to its stem and roots.\u201d Due to the special ability of the \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019, the jade ruler was totally cooled in an instant. Yao Lao gently swayed it about and handed it to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan received the jade ruler and felt his hand become warm and extremely comfortable. He could not resist smacking his lips. In his heart, he was even more envious of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. He tightly held the jade ruler, carefully swam toward the green lotus and gently cut the portion below the lotus seat that connected it to the receptacle. Instantly, the art-like green lotus fell down.</p><br/><p>Seeing it fall down, Yao Lao who was by the side quickly beckoned it, sucking it over and allowing it to float slowly in front of him. His face was filled with emotion as his gaze swept over it.</p><br/><p>After removing the green lotus, Xiao Yan eyed the roots and stem that were wildly swallowing the surrounding fire type energy from within the magma. He licked his mouth and said with a smile, \u201cTeacher. These roots are able to unrestrainedly absorb energy. They should also be a type of unique treasure. Why don\u2019t we take them away too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Against Xiao Yan\u2019s expectations, Yao Lao who was observing the green lotus shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh? Why?\u201d Hearing the words, Xiao Yan was at a loss and asked in a stunned manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor these spiritual things that require hundreds and thousands of years to form, it is best to leave something. Consider this a good deed. Although you have removed the green lotus this time, if you give it another thousand years, a new green lotus will be formed. However, if you also take the roots and stem away\u2026 then the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 would disappear forever from this crypt. For it to form again would be extremely difficult\u2026\u201d Yao Lao stared at the swaying roots and sighed. In the alchemist world, damaging the root and stems when obtaining a spiritual objects or ingredients is something that would infuriate others the most. After all, the requirement for a spiritual object to form were far too demanding.</p><br/><p>Hearing Yao Lao\u2019s emotional sigh, Xiao Yan nodded after being dazed for a moment. He placed the green ruler in his hand into the ring and shifted his gaze toward the long stem and roots. After which, he turned around and came to Yao Lao\u2019s front. His gaze was filled with joy as he stared at the green lotus, his face was filled with yearning.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne, two, three\u2026 there are a total of eleven Core-Fire Lotus Seeds. Haha, you are quite lucky.\u201d After counting the small fluorescent glow in the green lotus, Yao Lao could could not resist laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually I am very curious as to why Queen Medusa left all these treasures here when she came to snatch the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. Don\u2019t tell me that all these are nothing in her eyes?\u201d Xiao Yan suddenly said in a confused voice as he eyed the green lotus.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already told you. It may appear very easy when you used the jade ruler to remove the green lotus earlier but if you used other materials to forcefully cut it open, it would be something impossible. Queen Medusa isn\u2019t an alchemist so how would she know about this kind of small trick? Moreover, when she took the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, she must have been quite badly wounded by the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. Adding the surrounding magma heat and pressure, she did not have any extra time to waste\u2026\u201d Yao Lao smiled as he said. He once again took out ten small jade bottles and the jade ruler from the storage ring before he carefully picked the eleven Core-Fire Lotus Seeds from the lotus core and placed them into the jade bottles.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep all these things properly hidden. Don\u2019t easily let others see them, especially this green lotus. Other than when you are training, avoid using it as much as possible. Otherwise, you may attract unnecessary trouble.\u201d After storing all the jade bottles into the storage ring, Yao Lao handed it back to Xiao Yan and warned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d After wearing the storage ring on his finger, Xiao Yan swept his gaze to his surroundings. He realized that ever since the green lotus had left the roots and stem, the surrounding green colored glow seemed to gradually shrink.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Eyeing the surrounding change, Yao Lao\u2019s body trembled slightly and transformed into a thick white flame that covered the surface of Xiao Yan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded his head slightly and gently sighed. His gaze took one last glance at the green lotus roots, licked his tongue and stepped forward. Following which, his body swiftly swam out from the green glow.</p><br/><p>After leaving the green glow, Xiao Yan waved his hand at the Flame Spirit Serpent some distance away. He then followed behind it as they hurried back using the path which they had used before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is he still not out?\u201d At the mouth of the tunnel, Xiao Ding stared at the magma lake which had been quiet for a long time. His mood, which had just calmed down was gradually becoming anxious again. With his eyebrows pressed together, he began pacing up and down uneasily.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompany Leader, don\u2019t worry. I have received a notice. Young Master is on his way back. Nothing has happened to him.\u201d By his side, Qing Lin opened her eyes slightly. The glow in her dark green eyes glittered as she raised her small face watching Xiao Ding pacing up and down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it\u2019s like this\u2026\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Ding let out a sigh of relief. He walked to the tunnel exit, glanced at the hot magma which was repeatedly bubbling and involuntarily let out a bitter laugh. It was difficult for him to imagine that Xiao Yan had actually just leaped into it awhile back.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, what a frightening person\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPlop\u2026\u201d Before his sigh was released, the sound of water breaking sounded once again in the crypt. Xiao Ding hurriedly threw his gaze into the magma and found Xiao Yan\u2019s figure that was covered by a thick white flame gradually appearing in his sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Breaking through the thick magma surface, Xiao Yan let out a long breath. He lifted his head and watched Xiao Ding above before waving his hand. Stepping his foot onto the magma, his body shot up. As he approached them in midair, his back trembled and the Purple Cloud Wings shot out. The wings flapped and his body floated up toward the tunnel.</p><br/><p>As Xiao Yan\u2019s feet touched the ground, the thick white colored flame gradually disappeared from his body. His back trembled slightly and with a \u2018suo\u2019 sound, the Purple Cloud Wings once again turned into a dark black tattoo pasted on his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan, Xiao Ding hurriedly walked up and inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Smiling while shaking his head, Xiao Yan turned around and watched the magma world in the enormous crypt. He could not resist sighing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you got the thing?\u201d Sweeping his gaze across Xiao Yan\u2019s expression, Xiao Ding asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth twitched as he smiled bitterly, \u201cSomeone took it before me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Ding stilled. He mused for a moment and said softly, \u201cIt is the owner of the mysterious Qi, isn\u2019t it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, perhaps addressing her as Queen Medusa is more accurate.\u201d Xiao Yan took out a Seven-Colored Snake Scale and waved it at Xiao Ding while smiling bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, a Seven-Colored Snake Scale\u2026 it really is her\u2026\u201d Seeing that piece of seven colored snake scale, a bitter smile surfaced on Xiao Ding\u2019s face as he sighed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head. He pursed his lips together and said softly, \u201cI have figured out the whereabouts of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. After this, I will head directly to the inner regions of the Tager Desert. If I have the opportunity\u2026 I plan to steal the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 from Queen Medusa.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? You want to steal the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 from Queen Medusa\u2019s hands?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Ding was momentarily at a loss before his expression changed drastically and he involuntarily yelled.</p><br/><p>In the regions surrounding the Tager Desert, the fierce reputation of Queen Medusa would not lose to her coquettish reputation. Many people in the cities around the Tager Desert felt a great terror toward Queen Medusa to the point that they trembled upon hearing her name. Thus, even if Xiao Ding knew that Xiao Yan was quite strong, he still felt that it was absurd when he heard that Xiao Yan wanted to provoke Queen Medusa.</p><br/><p>After all, Queen Medusa was an extremely strong person renowned throughout the Jia Ma Empire unlike Luo Bu from the Rock Desert City. Back then, when the empire wanted to launch its soldiers to attack the Snake-People tribe, it had gotten the help of three Dou Wang but even they were still seriously wounded by Queen Medusa and the expedition forced to retreat. From this, it could be seen that this fierce reputation of Queen Medusa did not come from simple boasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Big Brother, relax. I am only just going to try. Even if I fail in the end, I am confident in my ability to flee.\u201d Xiao Yan reassured as he smiled at Xiao Ding.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 ugh\u2026\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s persistent manner, Xiao Ding could only shake his head helplessly as he had a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s go. Today, I\u2019ll go back and rest for one night. Tomorrow, I will have to begin traveling into the inner regions of the Tager Desert.\u201d Waving his hand, Xiao Yan turned around and headed into the tunnel. Behind him, Xiao Ding sighed and followed.</p><br/><p>Seeing the two who simply turned around and left, Qing Lin hurriedly whistled toward the magma lake. Immediately, the green light on the foreheads of the Two-Headed Flame Spirit Serpent expanded. An instant later, the snake\u2019s huge body shrunk, transformed into a green light and shot into Qing Lin\u2019s sleeves.</p><br/><p>Qing Lin patted her sleeves curiously with her small hand. A smile surfaced on her small face as she whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t create any trouble. Otherwise if Young Master will be angry and I will abandon you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss\u2026\u201d The soft hissing sound contained some dissatisfaction, it seemed that the serpent was dissatisfied with its owner\u2019s discrimination.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee.\u201d Qing Lin covered her small mouth and laughed softly. She lifted her small hand and bounced around in a lively manner as she caught up with Xiao Yan and Xiao Ding. The three of them gradually disappeared into the dark tunnel.</p><br/><p>As the three people\u2019s footsteps slowly faded into the distance, this enormous magma crypt once again entered into an everlasting calmness...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

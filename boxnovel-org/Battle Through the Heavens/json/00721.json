All of these gazes were momentarily absent-minded when they saw that bewitching lady. This kind of bewitching demon-like face really attracted too much attention.</p><br/><p>Of course, some of those people whom were quite familiar with this face changed their expressions drastically and let out exclamations upon seeing it.</p><br/><p>\u201cQueen Medusa?\u201d Jia Xing Tian, Fa Ma, and the other experts looked at the lady who had pulled Xiao Yan back as she withdrew with shocked faces as they involuntarily cried out.</p><br/><p>The cries of these few people also caused a commotion within the open ground. The fierce reputation of Queen Medusa was extremely great within the Jia Ma Empire. Although her traces had vanished these couple of years, her fierce reputation was still not reduced by much.</p><br/><p>Hai Bodong was a little better compared with the shock of Jia Xing Tian and the others. He had already seen Medusa once. Although he was not certain about the relationship between her and Xiao Yan, it did not seem like they were enemies.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith her intervention, it is likely that this situation will be a little better\u2026\u201d Hai Bodong sighed in relief within his heart as he quietly muttered. This Queen Medusa was also a genuine elite Dou Zong. Although she might not be comparable to Protector Wu who had swallowed the spirits of many experts, it was likely that she would be able to protect Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to panic. She has quite a deep relationship with Xiao Yan\u2026\u201d Hai Bodong turned his head to look at the shocked expressions of Jia Xing Tian and the others before smiling and explaining.</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Jia Xing Tian and the rest finally placed down the uncertainty in their hearts while feeling astonished. If a strong enemy like Queen Medusa were to appear in this kind of situation, it was likely that not a single person present could escape. Moreover, the most important thing was the current strength of Queen Medusa!</p><br/><p>The Medusa back then was merely at the peak of the Dou Huang class. Although she was much stronger than Jia Xing Tian, she was not a true elite Dou Zong. However, from the looks of the speed in which she attacked and her ability to block one blow from Protector Wu, it was likely that she had already reached the Dou Zong class.</p><br/><p>The peak of the Dou Huang class was only one step away from the Dou Zong class. However, the actual gap between them was just like a gulf. Jia Xing Tian was the most clear about this point.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is unexpected\u2026 that she has already broken through\u2026\u201d Jia Xing Tian sighed softly. His expression was somewhat bitter. He had remained at this stage for many years, but did not have the slightest improvement. Now that he saw that Medusa, who was of similar strength to him back then, had broken through, it was unavoidable for his heart to sob a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really unexpected\u2026 Xiao Yan actually has some friendship with her.\u201d Fa Ma shook his head. He quietly felt extremely astonished about Xiao Yan\u2019s strength in his heart. If one included Yao Lao, Xiao Yan\u2019s side basically possessed two elite Dou Zongs. This lineup\u2026 was really too frightening.</p><br/><p>The couple of people exchanged looks and smiled bitterly. It was completely unforeseen that the lone young man with limited strength would be able to gather such a powerful force within just three short years. This transformation was indeed too big.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun and Nalan Yanran in the air were startled at Medusa\u2019s appearance. Their eyes immediately began to change a little but that change quickly became invisible.</p><br/><p>\u201cI predicted that you would intervene\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan softly coughed as he looked at the figure beside him and smiled.</p><br/><p>Medusa knit her eyebrows slightly and spoke with a cold voice, \u201cI am only doing this because of the \u2018Soul Recovery Pill\u2019. Otherwise, who would be concerned about your life and death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He had long experienced this lady\u2019s tough mouth. Hence, he did not continue to get entangled with her on this topic. His gaze stared at Medusa and he softly said, \u201cToday, I will trouble you for one thing. If you are able to do it, I would not mind handing this life of mine to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Medusa\u2019s long narrow eyes that were filled with an unusual bewitching strength narrowed slightly upon hearing this. This was the first time since she had become acquainted with Xiao Yan that he had used such a begging tone in front of her. At this moment, there was an unknown emotion within her heart. She was extremely clear about the haughtiness in Xiao Yan\u2019s bones. However, today\u2026</p><br/><p>Queen Medusa slowly suppressed the unusual emotion within her heart. She glanced once at Protector Wu in front of her before looking at Yao Lao who was suspended not far away. She said, \u201cYou want me to intervene and protect that teacher of yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Medusa slowly tilted her head away under Xiao Yan\u2019s searing gaze. Her pretty eyes looked at Protector Wu who was a short distance away. It was a long while later before her red lips moved and she spat out a sentence, \u201cDifficult. This person is too strong even I am no match for him. If I protect you, I will be unable to divert any attention to protecting your teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart immediately sank when he heard these words from Medusa. Had the situation already become this terrible? Even an arrogant woman like Medusa actually said that she was no match for Protector Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you join hands with teacher to deal with this person?\u201d Xiao Yan probed. Although she was no match for Protector Wu on a one-on-one fight. It was likely that they would be able to contend with Protector Wu if they join hands, no?</p><br/><p>\u201cYour teacher has already suffered some injuries from the big battle earlier. His fighting strength has already greatly decreased. Even if I join hands with him, it will be similarly difficult to stop this person. No one would be able to stop that person should he grab any weak point to come and capture you again.\u201d Medusa slowly said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart sank even further when his suggestion was once again rejected. The situation today was indeed extremely terrible\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cQueen Medusa?\u201d</p><br/><p>Protector Wu had also recovered during the time that Xiao Yan was conversing softly with Medusa. The red glint under the cloak flickered when he heard the cries of Jia Xing Tian and the others. He had also heard about this name. That expert Medusa back then had a reputation on the continent that was not inferior to Yao Lao. Hence, the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 also paid some attention to the experts from this race. It was unexpected that they would meet here.</p><br/><p>TL: Apparently there are many Medusas over the generations and the Medusa that is being referred to here is one from a long time ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would advise you not to intervene in the matters of our \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019. Otherwise, it would be too late when trouble strikes.\u201d The red glow in Protector Wu\u2019s sharp eyes flickered as he spoke in a sinister manner upon sensing the strength being spread from Medusa\u2019s body that could not be underestimated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis life is mine. No one can touch it before I take it.\u201d Medusa glanced indifferently at Protector Wu and replied.</p><br/><p>The unusual red glow suddenly flickered under that cloak when he heard this. A powerful black fog surged out from Protector Wu\u2019s body before finally shooting to the sky like a smoke signal. The might that erupted from his body would cause even an expert Dou Wang to be struck down.</p><br/><p>Medusa\u2019 s cold face also revealed a seriousness for the first time as she felt the majestic aura that surged out from Protector Wu\u2019s body. This kind of expert was the first that she had met in such a long time. From the looks of it, it was impossible for them to part amicably today.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, we will give your suggestion a try. I will join hands with your teacher\u2026\u201d Medusa exhaled gently before turning to speak to Xiao Yan. With the current situation, it was likely that Yao Lao would be defeated in the hands of Protector Wu within a couple of exchanges if she merely protected Xiao Yan. Once Yao Lao was captured, it was likely that Xiao Yan would become ballistic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much, Xiao Yan will remember this favor!\u201d Xiao Yan cupped his hands toward Medusa with a solemn expression as he spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Queen does not have whatever relationship with you. I am only doing this because of the \u2018Soul Recovery Pill\u2019!\u201d Medusa coldly hooted. Her eyebrows immediately became vertical upon hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gave an embarrassed smile. It was difficult for him to argue with this woman who was so quarrelsome at such a time.</p><br/><p>Medusa let out a low snort when she saw that Xiao Yan had swallowed his voice and remained quiet. Her delicate hand moved and a dense seven colored energy rushed out. Finally, it became like a rainbow and agglomerated on her hand. A beautiful glow flickered from it.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao in the distance also hesitated a little upon seeing Medusa\u2019s actions. He once again summoned the \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019. The both of them attacked from the front and back as their auras were firmly locked onto Protector Wu in the middle.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, why? The both of you want to join hands?\u201d The crimson glow under Protector Wu\u2019s black cloak soared as he coldly laughed upon sensing the powerful strength both in front and behind him.</p><br/><p>Medusa and Yao Lao ignored the cold laughter of Protector Wu. Their bodies moved a little and instantly appeared at a spot not far from the latter. Powerful strength wiggled and they were ready to unleash a fierce attack at any moment.</p><br/><p>The red glow flickered and Protector Wu\u2019s gaze swept over Medusa\u2019s and Yao Lao\u2019s body. He frowned slightly under the cloak. From the looks of the current situation, he could not afford to drag things out any longer. The strength of these two people were quite strong. Should an accident happen, not only would he be unable to obtain the spirit today but he might even end up losing his life in this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like I can only use that move. It is really unfortunate. The spirit of an elite Dou Zong is not something that can just be randomly found\u2026\u201d Protector Wu sighed unwillingly within his heart. An unusual red glow erupted within Protector Wu\u2019s eyes and the seal on his hands suddenly changed!</p><br/><p>Following the change in the hand seal of Protector Wu, the black-colored armor that was covering his body suddenly became like a living thing and began to wiggle. An old face within it was slowly being pushed out. Finally, it transformed into a foot large illusionary human head. The human head was covered with pain, looking as though it was suffering an unusual torture.</p><br/><p>The people present were all familiar with this old face. This was because it was the spirit that Protector Wu had swallowed earlier, Yun Shan!</p><br/><p>Waves of low, deep, unusual tooting sounds suddenly sounded when Yun Shan\u2019s illusionary head appeared. Dark wind blew repeatedly over the sky, causing one\u2019s body to be covered with a chill.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun\u2019s and Nalan Yanran\u2019s gazes were staring intently at the illusionary head that was suspended beside Protector Wu. The back of their teeth tightly bit their lower red lips. Although their hearts were filled with an extreme fury, the powerful pressure that spread through the sky caused them to be afraid of making any unusual movements.</p><br/><p>Protector Wu\u2019s actions had also attracted the attention of Medusa and Yao Lao. The both of them quietly became cautious within their hearts.</p><br/><p>A ghost claw hand was slowly extended out from under Protector Wu\u2019s sleeves. He gently grabbed that illusionary human head and let out a ferocious smile. A strange black glow erupted from his palm and it immediately poured into the human head.</p><br/><p>Following the wild and violent pouring in of the black glow, that illusionary human head swiftly expanded. In the blink of an eye, it was over a hundred feet wide. When the head expanded, the painful expression on the face had also become much clearer. An unusual miserable spiritual streak faintly seeped out before following the dark wind to be spread all over the place.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of Nature: Funeral of Spirits!\u201d</p><br/><p>A sinister, cruel laugh suddenly resounded over the sky when that illusionary human head gradually expanded to around three to four hundred feet in size!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

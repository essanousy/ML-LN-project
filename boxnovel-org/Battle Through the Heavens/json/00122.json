Amongst them was the one who had many conflicts with Xiao Yan, Mu Li.</p><br/><p>On the leader\u2019s seat in the hall sat a middle-aged man with a slightly gloomy face. His finger lightly tapped on the tabletop. Finally, he was the one who broke the silence in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve just received news that amongst the groups that we had sent out to search, a two-man team went missing within the middle part of the Magic Beast Mountain Range.\u201d The slightly hoarse voice of the middle-aged man slowly sounded in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather. Could they have met with an attack by a Magic Beast?\u201d Mu Li smiled carelessly as he replied. Being killed by a Magic Beast was very common in the Mystical Beast Mountain Range.</p><br/><p>Hearing Mu Li\u2019s address, this middle-aged man could only be concluded to be the leader of the Wolf Head Mercenary Company, Mu She.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they had met with a Magic Beast attack, there should have been some traces of such a fight. However.. the mercenaries that we sent to reinforce them found no traces of a fight after searching the region that the pair was in charge of. If we eliminate the possibility of them falling from a cliff, a mistake that only a novice mercenary would make, I think that they may have been attacked by another person. Those missing traces of battle may have been the doing of that person.\u201d Mu She emotionlessly said as he shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you suspecting that this is the doing of Xiao Yan?\u201d Upon hearing Mu She\u2019s reasoning, Mu Li stilled. He quickly shook his head and said, \u201cI\u2019ve exchange blows with that guy. With his strength, to be able to kill two five star Dou Zhe before they even have the chance to raise a signal\u2026 it seems impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care if it\u2019s him or not. Tomorrow, we will send more people to carefully search the place.\u201d Mu She said in a deep voice. The inborn snake-like cautiousness in him did not allow the slightest chance to pass by him.</p><br/><p>TL: Joke on his name, She means snake</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, just as well,\u201d Mu Li waved his hand and nodded his head indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you managed to open the stone box that you carried back from the cave?\u201d After scanning his surroundings, Mu She suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe key to the stone box is in Xiao Yan\u2019s hand. I\u2019ve hired the best locksmith in the entire Qingshan Town but from the looks of it, we can\u2019t expect much.\u201d Mu Li said with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we cannot open the lock, then we\u2019ll try to use force to open the box. To be able to carelessly put aside over seven hundred thousand gold coins and some rare medicinal herbs, this ancient person was likely quite strong. The things that he left behind should also not be anything common.\u201d Mu She tightened his fist as greed flashed across his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Mu Li nodded his head and licked his lips. In a low voice, he asked: \u201cFather, what do you intend to do about the Little Fairy Doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what she obtained from the cave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Mu Li helplessly shaking his head, Mu She\u2019s eyes narrowed. He waved his hands and said in a deep voice, \u201cWe will not touch her for now. Her reputation in Qingshan Town is too good. If we make any rash moves, we may arouse the displeasure of the independent mercenaries.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we just going to allow her to peacefully stay at the \u2018Thousand Medicinal House\u2019?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. It is naturally impossible for her to have any peaceful days. Tomorrow, get someone to spread a rumor. Just say that the Little Fairy Doctor had obtained a relic of some strong person and that this relic was most likely a Xuan Rank Qi Method.\u201d Mu She laughed in a cold and evil manner, \u201cThat Little Fairy Doctor may be skilled in the art of healing but she\u2019s too weak. Not everyone in this world is kind. There will always be some greedy people who would think of ways to obtain the relic from the Little Fairy Doctor\u2026 As for how to handle such people, we will let her have a headache over it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a good plan. If even the \u2018Thousand Medicinal House\u2019 becomes interested in this relic, then the Little Fairy Doctor would lose her safe haven. Haha, when that time comes, it would be exceedingly easy to catch her.\u201d The corner of Mu Li\u2019s lip curled upwards with pleasure as he laughed.</p><br/><p>Mu She nodded his head slightly as he lightly rubbed the a scar below his ear. He said flatly, \u201cThe Little Fairy Doctor is not much of a threat. What I\u2019m really worried about is the boy whom you spoke of, Xiao Yan.\u201d Stopping there, Mu She\u2019s eyes showed a glint of resolve.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn order to be able to reach a two star Dou Zhe or higher at such a young age, his potential must be very strong\u2026 What really attracts my attention is that a boy younger than twenty did not show any arrogance someone his age should have and instead was able to hide his true strength so well. Had it not been for the life and death situation at the last minute, it was likely that no one would have guessed that he could push you back with just one strike.\u201d As his voice died down, a cold killing intent surfaced on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn enemy with such a potential must be killed before he has the chance to grow. Otherwise, we will not be able to afford it when he returns to seek revenge in the future!\u201d Mu She\u2019s finger pressed hard on the scar under his ear as he coldly spoke.</p><br/><p>Recalling how Xiao Yan managed to choose the perfect escape plan even when facing the dangerous predicament in the mountain cave, Mu Li\u2019s finger trembled slightly. Having such an enemy was giving him sleepless nights.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow, I will double the number of people in the search party. The monetary reward will be tripled. We must find that guy in the shortest amount of time!\u201d Mu Li said in a thick voice as he clenched his fist.</p><br/><p>Seeing how the father and son were so alert even when dealing with a young man in his teens, the top brass of the Wolf Head Mercenary Company seated in the hall wanted to snort with contempt. However, on the surface, they respectfully accepted their orders.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The galloping waterfall heavily smashed on the rocks, emitting a muffled sound of thunder that reverberated throughout the small valley.</p><br/><p>Standing beside the lake under the waterfall, Xiao Yan stared at the ten huge wooden stakes under the pounding waterflow. His face could not help but turn bitter as he smiled at Yao Lao beside him, \u201cTeacher, you don\u2019t intend for me to go down and train, do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour answer is correct.\u201d With a smile, Yao Lao said, \u201cI\u2019ve already told you before not to imagine a Di Rank Dou Technique as being the same as a Xuan Rank Dou Technique and that anyone can learn it. If you wish to learn something of this level, you need to achieve certain essential requirements.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHand me the Heavy Xuan Ruler.\u201d Reaching out his hand,Yao Lao lifted the strange looking black-colored, heavy ruler from Xiao Yan\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>The extremely heavy ruler on Xiao Yan\u2019s back only caused Yao Lao\u2019s hand to sink slightly upon receiving it. Yao Lao swung the large black ruler easily and asked with a smile, \u201cHave you seen a real Di Rank Dou Technique? Do you want to see one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes abruptly brightened. He nodded his head like a chicken feeding on rice.</p><br/><p>With a faint smile, Yao Lao held the Heavy Xuan Ruler as his body slowly ascended into the air, stopping only when his body was above the middle of the lake.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao lowered his head and looked at the lake surface four or five meters below him before raising his head and watching the silver, dragon-like, gigantic waterfall.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao took in a slow breath and narrowed his eyes. A moment later, he suddenly opened them. Instantly, a unfamiliar and frightening force like a dragon being awoken was emitted from Yao Lao\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>In the face of this force, the calm lake surface beneath Yao Lao\u2019s feet suddenly had white bubbles rolling over like it was being boiled. The bubbles being thrashed around under Yao Lao\u2019s feet began to spread until they encompassed the entire lake\u2019s surface.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was shocked as he stared at the scene of the lake with a stunned face. The current Yao Lao was entirely different from the lazy and indifferent old man that he usually was. At the moment, he was like a chilling knife being unsheathed, carrying a sharp, imposing force that one did not dare directly look at.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that this is someone who is truly strong\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan whispered in his mouth. A moment later, Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly blazed. He believed that one day, he would also be able to achieve this strength.</p><br/><p>Above the lake, Yao Lao indifferently and slowly lifted the black ruler in his hand. On the surface of the ruler, the numerous bizarre lines that Xiao Yan had once been confused about were emitting a fiery red light. When the surface of the ruler passed through empty space, the surrounding air suddenly became illusionary and blurry.</p><br/><p>Tightly grabbing the black ruler which had turned into the fiery redness like that of the sunset, Yao Lao let out a soft low cry and suddenly moved his body.</p><br/><p>His feet slowly stepped on the empty space as a blurry afterimage shockingly appeared under the light of the setting sun.</p><br/><p>Looking at the blurry afterimage in the empty space with a shocked expression, Xiao Yan became speechless. He did not expect that Yao Lao\u2019s speed was frightening to this extent.</p><br/><p>As the blurry afterimage scattered, Yao Lao\u2019s body appeared to have teleported to a spot under the huge waterfall that was over ten feet away. Compared to the huge waterfall, Yao Lao\u2019s small body was like an ant that did not attract anyone\u2019s attention. However, it was this ant like small figure that was currently carrying a force that was more frightening than the waterfall.</p><br/><p>The intense wind pressure that the waterfall carried as it descended did not even cause the small and weak-looking Yao Lao to move.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s body, which had shot forward abruptly, came to a stop. His feet stepped on the empty air and spun a hundred and eighty degrees. The light emitting from the black ruler in Yao Lao\u2019s hand grew increasingly bright. Moments later, the brightness forced Xiao Yan to narrow his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cDi Rank Dou Technique: Flame Splitting Tsunami!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the empty space of the valley, a muffled sound like thunder exploded. This was quickly followed by an extremely turbulent heat wave that was scattered throughout the entire valley.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d Numerous water pillars suddenly sprung from the surface of the wide lake, revealing a spectacular sight.</p><br/><p>Between the water pillars, an enormous red light suddenly flashed. At the spots where the red light passed through, the water pillars immediately disappeared and were replaced by a cloud of mist.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d The red light was like a shocked goose that shot across the lake\u2019s surface like lightning, creating a tsunami that was over ten meters tall. Finally, it smashed heavily into the galloping waterfall.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>A deafening, explosive sound of thunder continued to reverberate through the valley as countless rocks broke and fell from the cliff wall.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan covered his ears and widened his mouth at the noise that was created by the attack. A moment later, he swallowed his saliva with difficulty and shifted his gaze to the place where the waterfall was. However, a thick fog blocked his sight.</p><br/><p>A ferocious wind blew from the surface of the lake, scattering the fog in the valley. The huge waterfall behind the mist was also slowly revealed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes widened as he stared at the waterfall that had appeared. He was dull for a moment before slowly taking in a breath of cold air.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the tremendous water flow of the waterfall was actually cut off, exposing the huge rocky gully behind. It was over a hundred feet long and thirty feet wide.</p><br/><p>On the edge of the gully, countless small crack lines covered the entire rocky wall, appearing like an ivy.</p><br/><p>The water stream of the waterfall was cut off for over twenty seconds before it began to gradually flow down, covering the huge scars on the rock surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the strength of a Di Rank Dou Technique?\u201d Xiao Yan rubbed his chest, feeling a little flustered and suffocated.</p><br/><p>Descending from the sky, Yao Lao lightly placed a finger on the stunned Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlame Splitting Tsunami, Low Di Dou Skill. When mastery is achieved, cutting mountains and breaking waves can be easily accomplished.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though it was a simple description, it still gave Xiao Yan much happiness.</p><br/><p>Stabbing the Heavy Xuan Ruler into the ground, Yao Lao wiped his hands against each other and raised his chin at the ten huge wooden logs under the waterfall. He smiled, \u201cFrom today onwards, you will need to withstand the flow of the waterfall as you train. Once you are able to hold your ground on the tenth log and cut against the water flow for three hundred times, you will have achieved the first step in using the \u2018Flame Splitting Tsunami\u2019. But you need to remember that with your strength, you can at most use the \u2018Flame Splitting Tsunami\u2019 once. If you try to forcefully use it a second time, you will receive a serious internal injury and may affect your future potential. Thus, do not carelessly use it unless it is a very crucial moment!\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s voice grew severe towards the end of his speech.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head as he followed Yao Lao\u2019s gaze and stared at the bottom of the waterfall. The loud, banging noises emitted from the water crashing against the enormous rocks made him shiver as he let out a hollow laugh, \u201cWith such a strong force, if one were to enter without the protection of one\u2019s Dou Qi, one would instantly be knocked unconscious, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d Yao Lao spread out his hands and extended one to Xiao Yan with a smile, \u201cWhen you are training, you must have the Heavy Xuan Ruler with you. When you want to use the \u2018Flame Splitting Tsunami\u2019 in the future, you will have to rely on it. Without it, this Di Rank Dou Technique would only have around thirty percent of its strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdditionally, please hand over all the \u2018Energy Recovery Pill\u2019 you have with you. This training does not require it. You will have to rely on yourself to recover your Dou Qi.\u201d Yao Lao took the pills directly from Xiao Yan\u2019s storage ring as he smiled.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Yao Lao had confiscated all of his reserve stock, Xiao Yan could only helplessly twitch the corner of his mouth. He turned around and eyed the huge wooden log under the waterfall before clenching his teeth, \u201cWhat kind of misery have I not overcome? Do you think I would be overwhelmed by this difficulty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the Di Rank Dou Technique, I will fight!\u201d Clenching his teeth and letting out an angry cry, Xiao Yan stripped his clothes and jumped onto a huge rock. With a threatening gesture, he leapt to the first wooden log.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d As Xiao Yan landed on the wooden log, a huge force from the waterfall ruthlessly knocked onto his body before he could call upon his Dou Qi to protect his body. He felt a sharp pain on his back before the ferocious force showed no sign of restraint as it knocked him off the wooden log and into the lake.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s head surfaced from the lake and vomited the water that went into his stomach. He shouted angrily, \u201cI\u2019m going to drag it out with you today!\u201d After he shouted, Xiao Yan climbed out the of lake and once again jumped onto the huge rock before furiously rushing onto the wooden log.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn your grandmother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seated on a huge rock by the lakeside, Yao Lao watched the young man use his stubborn strength to repeatedly challenge the waterfall. He smiled faintly as a pleased look appeared in his eyes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

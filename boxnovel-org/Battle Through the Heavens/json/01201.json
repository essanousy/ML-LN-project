The old man Qing Hua, who had been observing from a short distance away, transformed into a blurry figure at this moment as he rushed to the essence flame with lightning-like speed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly knit his eyebrows when he saw old demon Qing Hua react so quickly. His eyes flickered, but he did not act immediately. Although the essence flame had appeared, there were still three Honorable Elders from the Hall of Souls looking on with ill intent. It would not be easy to snatch this flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old demon Qing Hua\u2019s speed was extremely swift. Within a flash, he had appeared in front of the dark-black fire dragon. A hot expression flashed across his eyes. A vast, mighty Dou Qi surged out of his palms and grabbed the fire dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, you are seeking death!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dou Qi of old demon Qing Hua had just been summoned when a couple of cold cries suddenly sounded before he could even make contact with the essence flame. Immediately, a wave of rattling metal sounds was transmitted over. A dark, cold wind stuck to the back of old demon Qing Hua.</p><br/><p>Old demon Qing Hua slightly frowned upon sensing this vicious force. His body flashed, and he hurriedly dodged. After which, his eyes were ice-cold as he looked at the black-clothed person who had intervened.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, other people are not allowed to encroach upon the things my Hall of Souls want.\u201d That black-clothed person coldly laughed. Over a dozen dark-black chains lingered around his body like poisonous snakes. Sharp spiritual screeches continued to be transmitted from the chains.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will watch him. All of you should act and snatch the essence flame.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-clothed person, who had attacked old demon Qing Hua, turned his head to the other two black-clothed Dou Zuns. He spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those two black-clothed Dou Zuns also nodded upon hearing his words. After which, they rushed toward the essence flame.</p><br/><p>The expression of old demon Qing Hua changed slightly upon seeing the action of these two people. His foot had just stepped out when over a dozen dark-black chains cut through the air. They carried a sharp, chilling aura that wrapped around all of his vital points.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Qing Hua immediately let out a quiet curse as these dark-black chains rushed over. However, he did not dare to easily slight them. The Dou Qi within his body surged out at this moment. Using his bare hands, he began a tough fight with that black-clothed Dou Zun.</p><br/><p>While old demon Qing Hua was being pestered, those two black-clothed Dou Zuns surrounded the dark-black, small fire dragon one behind the other in front. Their eyes exchanged a glance with one another, and their fingers were flickered. Ten somewhat tiny, dark-black chains rushed out of their sleeves with a clanging sound. After which, they ruthlessly rushed over to the essence flame of the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>The size of the small fire dragon was still quite impressive, about ten feet in size. Although its size was far inferior to its previous self, the vaguely present, destructive aura around it caused one to be afraid of underestimating it even a little.</p><br/><p>A fierce glint flashed over the eyes of the Three Thousand Burning Flame in the face of the combined attack of two black-clothed Dou Zuns. Today, it had escaped the seal of the three great heads with much difficulty. It was unexpected that it had been forced to leave its actual body by the fierce individuals of the Hall of Souls just after it escaped\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cPuff!\u201d</p><br/><p>A dark-black flame covered the entire body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame. It swung its dragon tail, which transformed into a black lightning. It rushed toward the black-clothed Dou Zun in front of it.</p><br/><p>That black-clothed Dou Zun was slightly shocked as he watched the Three Thousand Burning Flame retaliate. The fate of Old Mu Gu earlier had caused him to be afraid of underestimating the flame. Immediately, he swung his sleeves. Black fog surged and a countless number of dark-black chains gathered together. They were just like a giant python as it violently collided with the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cClang clang clang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The violent collision between both parties caused sparks to shoot out. Immediately, wave after wave of clear metallic sounds appeared. The fierce chain python completely split apart after facing the Three Thousand Burning Flame\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis beast is very strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the heart of this black-clothed Dou Zun was filled with caution, collapsing upon contact had somewhat exceeded his expectation. Immediately, his footsteps moved and his body hurriedly withdrew.</p><br/><p>However, he had just showed signs of withdrawing when the space wiggled. The dark-black Three Thousand Burning Flame rushed out of the space. After which, it was accompanied by a destructive aura that shot toward the heart position of the black-clothed Dou Zun, like an arrow released from a bow.</p><br/><p>This extremely fierce attack of the Three Thousand Burning Flame had aroused a fierce aura within the heart of this black-clothed Dou Zun. Since when had he been forced into such a state during all these years?</p><br/><p>This fierce aura had just surged in his heart when the black-clothed Dou Zun suddenly clenched his right fist. A vast, mighty, dark-black, chilly fog gushed of his body. After which, he threw out a merciless punch!</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The punch heavily collided with the fire dragon. A thunderous explosion resounded over the Star Region. A hot fire wave swept out in a lightning-like fashion.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug!\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression of the black-clothed Dou Zun changed almost instantly following the collision between the two. A mouthful of bright-red fresh blood was spat out. After this collision, he finally understood just how terrifying this Three Thousand Burning Flame was. Although the Three Thousand Burning Flame had been weakened after having experienced various battles, its annihilation strength still managed to destroy his defensea in an easy manner within a mere instant.</p><br/><p>The feet of the black-clothed Dou Zun continuously stepped back. A moment later, he finally stabilized his body in a somewhat miserable manner. His face was covered in shock. No wonder Old Mu Gu could not even receive a blow earlier. This destructive force was really too difficult to block.</p><br/><p>Although the black-clothed Dou Zun was seriously injured, the dark-black flame of the Three Thousand Burning Flame had also become much darker. Clearly, that attack from earlier had exhausted it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack, it will not be able to endure for long!\u201d</p><br/><p>That black-clothed Dou Zun wiped off the blood dripping from the corner of his mouth. He saw the flame on the body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame suddenly become dimmer. A joy surged into his shocked eyes as he cried out to his companion.</p><br/><p>The other Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls also nodded upon hearing this. However, after prior experience, they were much more careful. He waved his sleeves and countless numbers of spirits, covered by black fog, appeared. After which, they surged toward the Three Thousand Burning Flame from all directions. From the looks of it, he intended to use the soul explosion to completely exhaust the remaining strength of the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>Although this tactic was a vicious one, it must be said that it was quite effective. Under the suicidal charge of the countless number of spirits, the Three Thousand Burning Flame could only continue to dodge. However, the deep-black flame on its body was gradually becoming paler. It appeared to show signs of returning to the kind of purple-black flame of the past.</p><br/><p>The Three Thousand Burning Flame continued to dodge the soul explosions as a furious roar reverberated through the air.</p><br/><p>Seeing this scene, Old Mu Gu and the black-clothed Dou Zun, who had suffered a great loss to the hands of the Three Thousand Burning Flame, also sighed in relief. If the four Dou Zuns were unable to deal with the Three Thousand Burning Flame despite acting together, they would definitely be punished when they returned.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan in the distance observed the Three Thousand Burning Flame being forced to dodge by the tactics of the Dou Zuns from the Hall of Soul. His eyes slowly narrowed. Currently, he could sense the Three Thousand Burning Flame growing weaker.</p><br/><p>\u201cThings are bad. It is unexpected that these people from the Hall of Souls would be this vicious. They use such a tactic to exhaust the strength of the Three Thousand Burning Flame\u2026 if this continues, the Three Thousand Burning Flame will likely land in their hands.\u201d Qiu Ling by the side spoke in a deep voice with an unusually grave expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas teacher and the rest not freed themselves?\u201d Cao Ying knit her brows and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Star Region cannot accommodate so many elite Dou Zuns. Originally, the Star Region should have collapsed soon after these people entered. However, from the looks of it, the three association heads are stabilizing it. I think that they should be able to split their attention and enter soon\u2026\u201d Qiu Ling replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do? The Three Thousand Burning Flame looks like it will not be able to endure for long.\u201d Chen Dan softly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave it to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This sudden laugh caused Qiu Ling and the others to be startled. Their eyes immediately turned to Xiao Yan, only to see that he had a face full of smiles.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder Qiu Ling. Can I invite you to intervene and block Old Mu Gu and the other injured Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls?\u201d Xiao Yan glanced around as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Mu Gu and that black-clothed Dou Zun are seriously injured. It is not difficult to block them.\u201d Qiu Ling hesitated before replying in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, in that case, I will have to trouble First Elder Qiu Ling with regards to the two of them. Leave the final Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls and the Three Thousand Burning Flames to me\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan slightly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 can you handle it?\u201d Qiu Ling was startled when he heard Xiao Yan\u2019s words. He immediately asked somewhat doubtfully. Although he did not have any comments about Xiao Yan\u2019s pill refinement ability, this was currently not pill refinement. Instead, it was a real battle. From the looks of the aura of the Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls, who was fighting the Three Thousand Burning Flame, he should be an expert whose strength had reached that of a three star Dou Zun. With Xiao Yan\u2019s strength, fighting him and dealing with the Three Thousand Burning Flame would not be a relaxing task.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled in the face of Qiu Ling\u2019s doubt. He flicked his finger and a golden light suddenly rushed out of his Storage Ring. After which, it transformed into a golden human figure. It was surprisingly the Sky Demon Puppet that had evolved after having experienced numerous Pill Lightning.</p><br/><p>Qiu Ling was startled upon seeing this Sky Demon Puppet with its golden luster. He slowly nodded. It was possible for him to sense a faint dangerous from it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you are confident, I will leave the Three Thousand Burning Flame and the Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls to you. It will naturally be best if you have the confidence to subdue the Three Thousand Burning Flame\u2026\u201d Qiu Ling deeply looked at Xiao Yan. He was naturally aware that Xiao Yan was extremely interested in the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled as he nodded. He did not utter any additional unnecessary words. His feet stepped through empty space, and his body rushed in the direction of the Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls with lightning-like speed. The Sky Demon Puppet by his side transformed into a golden glow that followed close behind\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThree Thousand Burning Flame, you belong to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>A fiery heat that was difficult to hide flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes as he watched the small, black fire dragon!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

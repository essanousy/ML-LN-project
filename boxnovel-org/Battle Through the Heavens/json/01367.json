He and Xun Er were suspended in the air. His eyes were looking at the Hun duo below in a slightly teasing manner as he said, \u201cIt has been two years since we last met. Looks like the both of you have not been doing very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Ya\u2019s expression was gloomy. His eyes suddenly swept around him, but his heart quietly sighed in relief after failing to find that mysterious expert from back then. He coldly laughed, \u201cXiao Yan, you should not be overly arrogant. Even if I cannot get rid of you in the Heavenly Tomb, you will sooner or later be a homeless stray once we leave this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince that is the case\u2026 I should get the both of you to remain here forever. I think that given the strength of the both of you, you should be able to become eight star energy bodies right?\u201d Xiao Yan faintly smiled. However, his words caused a chill to rise within Hun Ya and Hun Li\u2019s bodies. Eight star energy bodies were basically lowly existences in the third level of the Heavenly Tomb. If the two of them were to become that existence, it would be much better to simply die.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really think too highly of yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Ya\u2019s duo narrowed their eyes. Their tones were dark and sinister. After having exchanged blows the last time, they understood that they were unable to easily defeat Xiao Yan and Xun Er. However, Xiao Yan\u2019s group did not have the ability to stop them if they wished to escape.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan grinned and softly wondered aloud.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what qualifications do you, trash from the declined Xiao clan, have to act arrogantly in front of us? If you hadn\u2019t been relying on a woman\u2019s strength, you would have already died many times over!\u201d Hun Li coldly ridiculed. The murderous desire in his eyes appeared extremely dense. If he wasn\u2019t afraid of Xun Er, he would have already attacked without control and completely finished off Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not be impulsive. They naturally possess some confidence to have the courage to appear. Let\u2019s withdraw first\u2026\u201d Hun Ya appeared a lot calmer. Although only Xiao Yan and Xun Er had appeared at this moment, he could vaguely feel an uneasiness. He grabbed Hun Li and spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Hun Li hesitated after hearing what Hun Ya had said. He could only unwillingly nod as he chillingly said, \u201cXiao Yan, you better remember this. The next time we meet will definitely be the time when your Falling Star Pavilion is annihilated!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Li and Hun Ya flew back after saying those words. Their eyes cautiously remained on Xiao Yan and Xun Er. The Dou Qi within their bodies began to rapidly circulate.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that whether or not you can leave is not up to the two of you\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan grinned and softly commented when he saw Hun Ya and Hun Li pulling back. \u201cLeave it to me\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s body disappeared in a ghost-like fashion after his final word sounded.</p><br/><p>An enchanting smile surfaced on Xun Er\u2019s face as she watched Xiao Yan disappear. The current Xiao Yan had already reached the peak of an eight star Dou Zun. This kind of level was stronger than the Hun duo. Hence, the present Xiao Yan was sufficient to deal with those two!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, you are asking to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Ya and Hun Li sensed something the moment Xiao Yan\u2019s body disappeared. A fierce glint flickered in Hun Li\u2019s eyes. His body shook abruptly as he clenched his fist, and a cold black fog surged out. It ruthlessly smashed toward the empty space in front of him.</p><br/><p>A somewhat illusory body slowly appeared when Hun Li\u2019s fist punched at the air. A long arm was extended and gently grabbed Hun Li\u2019s fist, which was covered in black fog.</p><br/><p>A frightening flame spluttered out of Xiao Yan\u2019s palm when the fist and palm collided. The dark cold fog on Hun Li\u2019s fist emitted a sizzling sound as it was completely vaporized.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have improved so little during these two years. How disappointing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s hand was just like a rock. It did not move even a little regardless of how Hun Li struggled. Xiao Yan slowly shook his head as he watched Hun Li\u2019s expression change. Xiao Yan shook his arm and strangely bypassed Hun Li\u2019s fist before smashing the other party\u2019s chest with lightning like speed. A frightening force suddenly erupted like a volcano that had been brewed for a long time upon contact.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fierce force made Hun Li\u2019s chest quiver. Having suffered such a heavy blow, Hun Li\u2019s expression had turned pale in an instant. A mouthful of crimson blood was wildly spat from his mouth. His body flew back like a kite with a broken string. He finally rubbed against the ground and formed a hundred meter gully before slowly coming to a stop.</p><br/><p>\u201cEight star Dou Zun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shock suddenly surged onto Hun Ya\u2019s face as he glanced at Hun Li in the gully, who was struggling to climb to his feet. Both of his eyes were filled with disbelief as he looked at Xiao Yan. The aura that had erupted from Xiao Yan earlier had reached the eighth star, and the strength of that aura was much stronger than his!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Ya\u2019s mouth twitched. His heart involuntarily let out a roar. During these short two years, the two of them had failed to even increase their strength by one star, yet Xiao Yan had soared from a six star Dou Zun to the eighth star. Hun Ya was really unable to accept this kind of vast difference.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is your turn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes landed on the shocked-looking Hun Ya after finishing off Hun Li with a fast and powerful momentum. He laughed in a faint voice.</p><br/><p>Hun Ya clenched his fist when he saw Xiao Yan look over. His pupils became sinister as they stared at Xiao Yan before both of his hands formed numerous seals. With the change of these seals, a mysterious clan tattoo swiftly appeared on his brow.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I am unaware of why your strength has soared, you are still unqualified to retain me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Ya\u2019s strength rapidly soared with the appearance of the clan tattoo. The sharp miserable cry of spirits continued to be emitted from his body. Xiao Yan\u2019s strength might have soared to its current level, but it was not enough to cause Hun Ya to panic. Earlier, Hun Li was at a disadvantage because he was careless. He had suffered a fatal blow before he could even activate his clan tattoo. Otherwise, Xiao Yan would not have been able to defeat Hun Li this quickly. Hence, Hun Ya believed that as long as he was a little more careful, it would not be simple for Xiao Yan to retain him.</p><br/><p>Hun Ya had no intention of remaining behind to engage in a bitter fight with Xiao Yan despite having summoned the clan tattoo. There was still an even more powerful Xun Er watching menacingly from the side. Once she intervened, Hun Ya knew that he would certainly die. He took advantage of the great rise in his Dou Qi. His body turned, and he transformed into a ray of light that hurried far away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHun Li, you can rest assured that I will help you take revenge a hundred times over for this!\u201d Hun Ya clenched his teeth and spoke while his body was wildly rushing away.</p><br/><p>However, Hun Ya\u2019s voice had just escaped his mouth when his swift figure suddenly paused. He lifted his head and his eyes looked a short distance away in a hateful manner. A figure flapping a pair of crystal clear bone wings was standing in the air. That mocking face surprisingly belonged to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Seeing the speed of Xiao Yan, which could not be detected, Hun Ya\u2019s heart also sank, but he did not hesitate much. His foot stepped on empty air and the Dou Qi within his body erupted without being held back. It carried an extremely powerful energy pressure as it rushed toward Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>There was little change in Xiao Yan\u2019s face when he saw Hun Ya risking it all. His body did not retreat. He instead took a step forward. His eyes were calm as he watched that swiftly enlarging energy light figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Ya felt a slight joy in his heart when he saw that Xiao Yan was too arrogant to dodge. Having activated his clan tattoo, even an expert Dou Zun at the peak of the eighth star would not dare to clash head-on with him. Xiao Yan was undoubtedly suicidal!</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Ya was extremely swift and fierce. In a flash, he had appeared in front of Xiao Yan. A wild and violent wind pressed on Xiao Yan robes until they fluttered. His right hand was clenched into a fist. The mighty Dou Qi in his body gathered as he ruthlessly threw out a punch!</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Hun Ya\u2019s punch was thrown, the space in front of him collapsed. A five-feet-large black spatial line quickly expanded toward Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, this is the fate of boasting to be more than you are capable of. You should firmly remember it in your next life!\u201d</p><br/><p>A punch that contained a terrifying wind swiftly smashed toward Xiao Yan. Regardless of how fast Xiao Yan was, he would not be able to dodge this attack. Hence, a dense cold smile surfaced on Hun Ya\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>A faint ripple finally rose within Xiao Yan old well-like dark-black eyes. A ridiculing smile was lifted on his face as a purple-red light flickered on his brows. Finally, a mysterious clan tattoo slowly appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao clan\u2019s clan tattoo?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Ya\u2019s heart abruptly trembled the moment this clan tattoo appeared. An unease quietly spread from deep within his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled as he studied the dense face in front of him, which was in close proximity. He clenched his right fist, and a turbulent Dou Qi suddenly blasted forth!</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both of the fists suddenly collided. A frighteningly loud sound exploded like thunder. Many ten-foot-large lines began to spread swiftly on the ground like a spider web.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>A black figure suddenly flew out of the energy storm that raged in the sky. The figure heavily crashed onto the ground. The large rocks in its path were blasted into dust amid many rumbling sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug!\u201d</p><br/><p>A mouthful of fresh blood mixed with organ fragments was spat out of Hun Ya\u2019s mouth as he lay within the thick rock dust. He sensed that his life was quickly disappearing from his body. A horror and regret finally surged into his eyes.</p><br/><p>A skinny figure was slowly appearing in the sky. Indifferent eyes glanced at Hun Ya below, who was on his deathbed. His head shook as he stepped through the empty air as he slowly walked to that beautiful figure in the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, there will be even more members of the Hun clan who will accompany you in the future\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Ya\u2019s eyes gradually succumbed to the darkness as an indifferent voice was softly transmitted to his ears.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

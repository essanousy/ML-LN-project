In its completed form, it was almost like a dazzling sun high up in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cWind\u2019s Peak: Killer Meteorite!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that instant, the air surrounding Yun Shan instantly solidified. His finger suddenly pointed at Xiao Yan. With a stern cry, the white glow emitted a bright flash and an extremely narrow ray of light explosively shot out.</p><br/><p>The speed of the ray of light was so fast, that it was somewhat frightening. Wherever it passed, the air became disturbed and distorted. A dark, black trace stained the blue sky, appearing extremely eye-piercing.</p><br/><p>This terrifying Dou Technique was something that Yun Yun had used before when she fought with the Amethyst Winged Lion in the past. This attack had directly cut off an Amethyst Winged Lion\u2019s horn, which was the hardest part of its body, which also possessed the strength of a Dou Huang. From this, it could be seen just how terrifying the piercing strength of this mysterious Dou Technique was. Moreover, the Dou Technique was currently displayed by Yun Shan. Regardless of whether it was momentum or the extent of the strength of the force, the Dou Technique this time had far surpassed the power that Yun Yun had displayed back then.</p><br/><p>Once \u2018Wind\u2019s Peak\u2019 appeared, the expressions of Jia Xing Tian and the others far away from the battleground changed at almost the same time. Immediately, they hurriedly pulled back a very great distance as though they were fleeing. From the looks of it, they already knew how frightening this Dou Technique was. They might even have personally gotten a taste of it before.</p><br/><p>Only Xiao Yan, and Queen Medusa in the sky could remain still with expressions that did not change.</p><br/><p>\u2018Xiao Yan\u2019 indifferently watched the white-colored ray of light that instantly broke through the air and shot toward him. He lifted his hand gently. The thick white-colored flame shrouding his finger suddenly rose and flared up. In the blink of an eye, it completely wrapped his body within it. His right hand was extended and the huge Heavy Xuan Ruler once again appeared in his palm. It was gripped abruptly and tightly as an eye-piercing, intense light erupted from the dark, black body of the ruler.</p><br/><p>The intensity of the bright light on the ruler\u2019s body grew increasingly extreme. In the end, it was almost like a bright sun that caused people to be afraid to look at it directly.</p><br/><p>With a serious expression, Xiao Yan let out a low cry. The heavy ruler in his hand abruptly hacked ferociously downward toward Yun Shan, who was a short distance away.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlame Splitting Tsunami!\u201d</p><br/><p>The cry resounded throughout the sky. A crescent-shaped, white-colored energy blade that was thirty feet in length shot explosively out of the tip of the Heavy Xuan Ruler.</p><br/><p>The huge, flaming white, crescent blade energy projectile shot across the skyline, disappearing in a flash. That hot feeling which suddenly appeared almost caused the people in the battleground to be in a wave of fire.</p><br/><p>The curved blade of energy carried numerous ear piercing explosions as it cut across the skyline. That indomitable strength even had the tendency of wanting to split the sky into half.</p><br/><p>The Dou Technique displayed was the same one, but the \u2018Flame Splitting Tsunami\u2019 this time around was at least ten times stronger than the one that Xiao Yan had displayed at the Misty Cloud Sect back then! This was the gap created by the difference in one\u2019s strength!</p><br/><p>The crescent moon-shaped blade cut through the distant air. Under the watch of countless gazes, it finally collided with the white-colored energy beam that was shooting across the sky in a lightning-like manner. In an instant, a thunder-like roar exploded into the blue sky. Terrifying energy waves began surging out from the point of collision. That enormous pressure actually caused some of the people standing in the square to be directly pressed into a fetal position.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the strength of a Dou Zong? It is indeed extremely extraordinary.\u201d Even though Jia Xing Tian and the others were a great distance away, the energy waves that came toward them still caused their expressions to change slightly as they once again pulled back even further. After steadying himself, Jia Xing Tian lifted his head and eyed the spot where the two people were fighting with heated gazes. No matter how one put it, he was an extremely strong person who had already taken half a step into the Dou Zong class. However even if it were so, if he were faced with a true Dou Zong, he would still feel an enormous gap which was difficult to cross.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the current Xiao Yan also has the strength of a Dou Zong, no? Otherwise, it would definitely be impossible for him to blow away Yun Shan\u2019s \u2018Wind\u2019s Peak\u2019. It should be known that when Yun Shan was still a Dou Huang back then, he had used this move to kill two strong people of the his strength from the Chu Yun Empire.\u201d Fa Ma\u2019s face was grave as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if you have realized, but ever since Xiao Yan\u2019s strength suddenly soared, he has merely used that thick white-colored \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. He did not use even a little of that green-colored flame.\u201d Fa Ma suddenly said. As an alchemist, it was natural for him to be extremely attentive toward flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But the manner in which the current Xiao Yan uses to control that white-colored flame is clearly much more refined compared to earlier.\u201d Jia Xing Tian nodded his head and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow is really someone whom others cannot figure out.\u201d Fa Ma mused for a moment, but did not even have the slightest clue. He could only shake his head and speak with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Jia Xing Tian nodded his head, completely sharing the same opinion. He immediately raised his head and watched the spot where the energy ripples were gradually disappearing. When he saw that Xiao Yan was still standing in midair unscathed, he said, \u201cLooks like it is a little difficult for Yun Shan to hold Xiao Yan behind today. Moreover, there is still Queen Medusa, whose strength is not weaker than Xiao Yan\u2019s, lurking by the side. If these two people were to combine their strength, even Yun Shan can only turtle up and hide.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe current Yun Shan is also in a stubborn situation and has no choice but to continue. The First Elder of the Sect was killed by someone in front of so many people. Regardless of the other party\u2019s strength, he must take action. Otherwise, the Misty Cloud Sect will greatly lose face if this news were to spread. After all, this matter is different from last time.\u201d Fa Ma sighed, \u201cMoreover, the enmity between both parties has already been completely formed. With Yun Shan\u2019s character, he would definitely not let a future enemy with such terrifying potential leave successfully.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter was also something that Yun Leng asked for. He had nothing to do and still ran to Wu Tan City to go against the Xiao clan. Isn\u2019t this forcing Xiao Yan to become crazy? He thinks that he can do whatever he wants by using the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s name, but he never expected that he would meet a ruthless figure this time around.\u201d Jia Xing Tian said faintly.</p><br/><p>Fa Ma smiled bitterly and shook his head. He did not voice any opinions regarding this matter. Instead, he lifted his head and watched Xiao Yan\u2019s and Yun Shan\u2019s bodies, which had reappeared and muttered softly, \u201cAh, I hope they will not cause any injuries or deaths. Otherwise, it would be a great loss to the Jia Ma Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, the Sect Leader of the Misty Cloud Sect is only so-so.\u201d Xiao Yan gently flicked his sleeves in the sky, scattering the final assaulting energy ripple that had spread toward him. A cold smile surfaced on his delicate and handsome face.</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s expression was icy cold as he watched Xiao Yan who was actually unhurt. A long while later, he slowly inhaled a breath of air and said in a cold voice, \u201cThe current you is indeed very strong. However, I believe that there will always be a price for overdrawing your strength. My strength belongs to myself while your strength is borrowed or drawn excessively from yourself. As long as I delay you today, I don\u2019t believe that you can continue to maintain this strength!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe relationship between both sides has already reached a point where it is difficult to reconcile. Therefore, I will not let someone who could truly become a Dou Zong to successfully escape and continue to grow while carrying hatred for the Misty Cloud Sect within him before finally returning to obliterate my Misty Cloud Sect!\u201d A thick and cold killing intent had actually began to shroud Yun Shan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>The entire place was completely silent. The words of Yun Shan undoubtedly expressed his intent to kill Xiao Yan. This was because he clearly understood that should Xiao Yan successfully escape, it would definitely be allowing the tiger to return to the mountains. In the future, the Misty Cloud Sect might pay an extremely great price for letting him escape.</p><br/><p>TL: letting a tiger return to the mountains - idiom - letting a dangerous person escape and giving it the chance to exact revenge in the future</p><br/><p>The expression of \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019 changed slightly. These words of Yun Shan were true. Although Xiao Yan was currently being controlled by Yao Lao, the latter could not truly and completely control Xiao Yan\u2019s body. Moreover, the \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 that Xiao Yan had used earlier had exhausted quite a lot of Yao Lao\u2019s Spiritual Strength. If it were not for the \u2018Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva\u2019, it was likely that this \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 would have caused Yao Lao to enter into a weakened state once again.</p><br/><p>Even though Yao Lao did not enter into a weakened state because of the \u2018Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva\u2019, it was also as Yun Shan had said. He could not really borrow Xiao Yan\u2019s body to fight with Yun Shan for a long period of time. Once the time limit was up, he could only withdraw his Spiritual Strength. When that time comes, Xiao Yan, who had lost his protection, would definitely have difficulty escaping death.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, let\u2019s first leave this place. Yun Shan is very strong. The current us is not able to directly attack him. Moreover, the time that you can appear is also not very long.\u201d A weak voice suddenly sounded in \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019s\u2019 mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, relax. Although my current strength has weakened greatly, wanting to stop me with just Yun Shan alone is wishful thinking.\u201d The old laughter comforted Xiao Yan\u2019s emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, it is indeed not suitable to go head on against him in today\u2019s circumstances. The united formation of the Misty Cloud Sect is a little marvellous. Once it\u2019s activated, it would be much more troublesome to leave. Although that Queen Medusa appears to be helping you, she would definitely be unwilling to join hands with you to kill Yun Shan. A counterattack by a Dou Zong just before his death is no trivial matter. It is impossible for her to take such a big risk just because of you.\u201d Yao Lao mused for a moment before saying softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, today, I will not be overly entangled with him. Let\u2019s leave here first. We will return here in the future, and teacher will definitely help you seek justice!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, after leaving this time around, it may be a very long time before I return to the Jia Ma Empire. When that time comes, let me, your disciple, do it. At that time, my father\u2019s disappearance and the humiliation of the clan being forced to move will be settled by me, myself.\u201d The weak voice contained a faint vengeance. His father\u2019s disappearance had caused Xiao Yan to completely place this hatred and fury on the Misty Cloud Sect. If it were not because of them, Xiao Zhan would not have been chased out of Wu Tan City and would naturally not suddenly disappear. Moreover, when he was killing Yun Leng, the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s hindrance as well as the killing intent that Yun Shan had displayed earlier had caused Xiao Yan to completely feel an abomination toward this sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, it is naturally good to have this pride.\u201d Yao Lao smiled, feeling gratified. He said, \u201cSince it\u2019s like this, let us leave this place first. I cannot maintain control of your body much longer.\"</p><br/><p>In the sky, \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019 slowly lifted his head. His gaze took one look around and laughed loudly towards Yun Shan, \u201cI have told you earlier that if I want to leave, there is no one in your Misty Cloud Sect who can stop me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArrogant. Do you really think that our Misty Cloud Sect has relied on an undeserving reputation to stand in the Jia Ma Empire for so many years?\u201d Yun Shan pulled slightly at the corner of his mouth. He suddenly waved his sleeves and a few white glows shot out from his sleeves. These white glows were scattered toward four corners of the sky. A short while later, the glow bursted brightly. A countless number of white threads were extended. In merely the blink of an eye, these white threads had covered the entire sky, finally forming a net that appeared and disappeared, shielding the entire sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll Elders of the Misty Cloud Sect listen up. Form the \u2018Covering Sun Cloud Formation\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a stern cry, nearly twenty figures stood and flashed from the square. The glow immediately brightened greatly. White-colored mist pervaded from the bodies of these Elders. Finally, they agglomerated into a sea of clouds in the sky, just like the last time. The only difference was that Yun Shan was the one in the middle of the sea of clouds.</p><br/><p>The last time, Yun Leng, who was of the Dou Wang class, had relied on the \u2018Covering Sun Cloud Formation\u2019 to contend with Hai Bodong who was of the Dou Huang class. Now, the person controlling the formation had been replaced by Yun Shan, who had the strength of a Dou Zong. Without any doubt, the so called \u2018Covering Sun Cloud Formation\u2019 this time around would be even more terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cWithdraw!\u201d Before the \u2018Covering Sun Cloud Formation\u2019 was formed, Yao Lao controlled Xiao Yan\u2019s body and appeared at where the white-colored energy was in a lightning-like manner. The thick white flame surged out from his palm and smashed ferociously against the white cloud.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d The thick white flame smashed into the white-colored energy, but it actually failed to break it in one blow. Instead, it was reflected by the soft feeling on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed a little bizarre.\u201d Yao Lao let out an \u2018eh\u2019 sound as he waved his hand and once again summoning out a cluster of thick white flame. After which, he tightly adhered it onto the white colored energy barrier. This time around, the flame did not bounce back. The hot temperature caused the white energy to become a little illusionary.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to leave? It won\u2019t be so easy!\u201d Just as a hole was about to be incinerated out of the white barrier, a cold cry of Yun Shan sounded from behind \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019. As this cold cry was transmitted, there was a majestic force that was mixed with a sonic boom.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao instantly turned around. He eyed the white-colored energy force that was swiftly shooting toward him. He waved his sleeves and a huge cluster of thick white flames surged out from his sleeves. Immediately, it swiftly began to agglomerate into an ice mirror that appeared to have been formed from white fire. In addition, there was a white flame which was curling upward being adhered to the surface of the ice mirror. The ice and flame merged, mutually, surviving in one body, giving it an extremely strange appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>That energy pilliar smashed heavily into the ice mirror. When the two came into contact, the white-colored flame pounced turbulently forward. Any of the energy that had become contaminated by the flame was instantly frozen into solid ice pieces.</p><br/><p>Although the white-colored flame was extremely strange, the force that was contained within the energy pillar was really too large. Therefore, when the white-colored flame had climbed to around half of the energy pillar, its energy was exhausted. Immediately, it was smashed into nothingness by the energy which was surging from the back.</p><br/><p>The energy pilliar broke through the white-colored flame and violently smashed onto the ice mirror. Immediately, the latter began crumbling. Numerous crack lines covered the ice mirror which finally broke apart with a \u2018crack\u2019 sound, turning into pieces of ice that permeated the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you have the help of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, it will not be an easy thing to leave today!\u201d Yun Shan\u2019s body was suspended in the sea of clouds. The rich energy around him caused Yun Shan\u2019s body to emit a faint glow. He coldly watched Xiao Yan and his hands were swiftly rotated. The fog in front of him wiggled. A moment later, an enormous cloud bow, which was once summoned by Yun Leng, once again surfaced. This time around, the size of the cloud bow was nearly a few times larger than it had been the previous time. At a glance it appeared that the huge bow was one that could be used to shoot the sun down.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis \u2018Covering Sun Cloud Formation\u2019 is indeed a little troublesome.\u201d Yao Lao frowned slightly as he eyed that huge cloud bow. His gaze swept in all directions. Suddenly, he said something softly to Xiao Yan in his heart.</p><br/><p>A moment later, after Yao Lao had instructed some things, his body suddenly trembled lightly and immediately disappeared from midair.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s disappearance did not cause Yun Shan\u2019s expression to change. He slowly closed his eyes and his hands formed the shape of drawing the bow. After which, his body slowly swayed, as if Yun Shan was relying on his senses to search for the target to attack.</p><br/><p>The sky suddenly descended into silence.</p><br/><p>However, the silence did not persist for very long before it was suddenly broken. Yun Shan, who had shut his eyes abruptly opened them. The hand which he used to pull the bow no longer hesitated. He relaxed his finger and following its release, the large cloud arrow on the huge cloud bow in front of him cut through the cloud layer with a \u2018Chi\u2019 sound. It shot viciously toward a certain empty space.</p><br/><p>The cloud arrow transformed into a white-colored flowing ray of light that instantly cut through the skyline. Just as it was about to strike that empty space, a turbulent thick white flame suddenly swept out, much like the flames of heaven descending and turned into a ripple shape that spread in all directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the two came into contact, another loud sound appeared. However, the thick white flame did not appear to have much effect this time around. It merely blocked the arrow for an instant before the terrifying cloud arrow broke through the flame. With a \u2018xiu\u2019 sound, it passed through a certain empty space. Unfortunately, not even a part of a human figure appeared. Similarly, there was not the slightest fresh blood appearing.</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s gaze stared intently at the spot where the cloud arrow shot past. When he saw that the cloud arrow had struck empty space, he was startled. His expression immediately and abruptly changed. He suddenly turned around and moved his hands. The surrounding fog swiftly agglomerated. An instant later, it formed a huge cloud colored shield in front of him.</p><br/><p>The moment the white-colored cloud shield formed, a black figure suddenly flashed, and appeared from within the sea of clouds. The figure coldly watched Yun Shan who was behind the transparent cloud shield. As both of his hands moved, a green and white-colored flame actually appeared in his palm at the same time.</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s body trembled as he looked at the two flames. His gaze looked directly at the young man\u2019s pair of eyes. He immediately noticed that the green and white color in his eyes had actually once again turned back to being a dark, black color. As he watched those dark black pupils, Yun Shan, for some reason, suddenly thought that the current Xiao Yan had perhaps returned to his true self.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you want me to stay, then try the taste of this fire lotus!\u201d The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth lifted slightly as he spoke with a dark and cold smile. Earlier, Yao Lao had quietly informed him that once they were in close proximity, Xiao Yan should display his fiercest attack. This was because only Xiao Yan was able to control the \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019!</p><br/><p>TL Arron: Angry Buddha Lotus Flame is a cheat...</p><br/><p>As the laughter fell, Xiao Yan\u2019s hands abruptly smashed heavily together. With Yao Lao\u2019s strength supporting him this time around, the speed at which the two colored flames merged was many times faster compared to the one earlier. In a muffled thundering sound, a green-white flame, that was around the size of a palm, swiftly rose from the middle of Xiao Yan\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo!\u201d The arc on the corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth grew increasingly big. He let out a soft cry and the flame immediately shot over. Finally, it heavily smashed into the cloud colored shield in front of Yun Shan\u2019s slightly squinting eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 this time around was not created as perfectly as the one prepared with great effort the last time, Yao Lao\u2019s powerful strength was integrated into it. Therefore, its strength was not any weaker than the \u2018Flame Splitting Tsunami\u2019 which Yao Lao had personally displayed earlier.</p><br/><p>Following the thunderclap-like explosion being blasted, a fire lotus once again surfaced from within the sea of clouds. The cluster of energy clouds in the surroundings that were completely made up from energy had also become blurry from this attack.</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s body swiftly descended. His expression was a little pale. An explosion at such a close proximity nearly caused him to receive the full impact of the fire lotus. Therefore, even though he had the cloud shield protecting him, he was still shaken until he had to leave the sea of clouds. Moreover, once he left the sea of clouds, he would naturally no longer be able to use the large formation.</p><br/><p>Countless Misty Cloud Sect disciples in the square watched Yun Shan, who was shaken by Xiao Yan\u2019s attack until he actually had to leave the sea of clouds. They exchanged glances with one another and were speechless. For some unknown reason, a cold feeling rose from within their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand-teacher.\u201d When she saw Yun Shan descending, Nalan Yanran\u2019s delicate hands could not resist covering her red lips as he cried out involuntarily.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really worthy of being a fight between Dou Zongs. If we were in such close proximity to the fire lotus explosion, we would most likely lose half of our life, no?\u201d Fa Ma smiled bitterly and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI thought that Xiao Yan could no longer use the green-colored flame. He has actually left it as a means to escape.\u201d Jia Xing Tian shook his head and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan\u2019s strength appears to have become much weaker with the flow of time.\u201d Fa Ma suddenly knit his eyebrows. As a tier five alchemist, his Spiritual Perception had far exceeded an ordinary Dou Huang\u2019s. Therefore, he had promptly sense the slight change of Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment in the sky after he struck Yun Shan down from the sea of clouds. He abruptly clenched his teeth and his feet stepped gently on the empty air. His body fell abruptly and immediately shot explosively toward Yun Shan.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I will collect some interest!\u201d Two colored flames swiftly shrouded both his hands. Xiao Yan swiftly approached Yun Shan who was falling. At this moment, the latter had been shaken by the terrifying explosion earlier until the Dou Qi in his body could not be connected. Hence, he could only watch as Xiao Yan approached.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Fellow, since you have already given the order to chase and kill me, then I will kill you first!\u201d A cold laughter sounded as Xiao Yan\u2019s hands heavily smashed toward Yun Shan\u2019s chest. Just as he was about to succeed, a panicked voice suddenly sounded, \u201cXiao Yan, no!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the voice sounded, a force also swiftly came attacking Xiao Yan\u2019s back. He frowned slightly, turned his body and waved his hand gently. A white-colored flame shot out and incinerated the sharp sword aura until nothing was left. His eyes were cold as he watched Yun Yun who was holding a longsword in her hand as she was suspended in empty space. He said with a cold smile, \u201cYou also want to attack me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am the Sect Leader of the Misty Cloud Sect. I must protect the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s reputation. Moreover, Yun Shan is my teacher. I cannot just watch you hurt him.\u201d Yun Yun said with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think that I have any chance of surviving if I were to fall into his hands today?\u201d Xiao Yan mocked.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun was silent. There was a struggle on her pretty face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s hands trembled slightly. He inhaled a deep breath of air, turned around suddenly and waved his hand, wanting to throw a flame toward Yun Shan who was falling.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s action, Yun Yun clenched her white teeth. She flapped the wind wings on her back and stabbed the longsword in her hand toward Xiao Yan\u2019s back. No matter what, her position as the Sect Leader caused her to always remember the reputation of the sect. It was impossible for her to simply watch the reputation of the Misty Cloud Sect that was built up over a few generations be terminated by Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>The cold wind that was transmitted from behind his back caused Xiao Yan\u2019s heart to quietly become much colder. Perhaps he was somewhat insignificant in her heart when compared to the Misty Cloud Sect.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed softly in his heart. He slowly shook his head and gave up chasing and killing Yun Shan. He turned around and watched the attacking Yun Yun indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the moment when Xiao Yan turned around, two hurried cries suddenly sounded. One came from Yun Yun\u2019s mouth while the other was a warning from Yao Lao in his body.</p><br/><p>The cry had just sounded when Xiao Yan also sensed something. He hurried to turn his head and a white figure flashed across his pupils. A dense and thick face immediately appeared. It was shockingly Yun Shan who had been falling!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, Xiao Yan!\u201d</p><br/><p>A fist that carried a sonic boom and an enormous force of pressure caused ripples to appear in the space surrounding the fist. The fist that was wrapped in fog violently smashed against the back of the unprepared Xiao Yan like a lightning storm in front of Xiao Yan\u2019s tightly narrowed pupils.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlug!\u201d</p><br/><p>The enormous force that was transmitted from his back caused Xiao Yan\u2019s expression to pale. A mouthful of fresh blood was finally involuntarily spat out. Borrowing the pushing force from this great strength, Xiao Yan\u2019s body shot explosively backward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh.\u201d The situation in the sky had actually changed suddenly in a split second. This change caused the faces of everyone below to be stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Shan, with your position, you actually launched a sneak attack. You actually have the face to do so?\u201d Hai Bodong could not resist shouting angrily as his face changed while he looked at Xiao Yan who had vomited blood and pulled back.</p><br/><p>At the side, Jia Xing Tian and the others also frowned slightly. Clearly, they did not approve of Yun Shan\u2019s action, but they did not open their mouths to say anything.</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s face was cold as he ignored Hai Bodong. He clearly knew just what kind of terrifying potential Xiao Yan possessed. If he were allowed to leave, the Misty Cloud Sect might really be destroyed in his hands in the future. Therefore, even if he had to bare some notoriety, he must kill Xiao Yan today!</p><br/><p>While the sound of wind whizzed past his ear, Xiao Yan wiped the blood stain from the corner of his mouth. His eyes coldly eyed the pale faced Yun Yun. He flipped his hand and a pale-blue colored inner vest appeared in his hand. He held the inner vest and shook his head in self-ridicule. After which, he violently threw it toward Yun Yun.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of whether you are Yun Zhi or Yun Yun, we no longer have any relationship in the future! I will return this thing to you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The decisive words were wrapped by Dou Qi and coldly transmitted into Yun Yun\u2019s ears. Immediately, the already pale face of the latter became even more pale.</p><br/><p>As a reflexive condition, she extended her hand to receive the pale blue inner vest that was shot over. The back of her teeth bit her bottom red lip. She lowered her head and watched the inner vest which was wiped clean despite being covered with crack lines. For a moment, she was completely dull.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s body collided heavily into the white-colored energy barrier. Two colored flames surged turbulently out of his back. The two flames intertwined with one another and the white colored energy swiftly melted. Immediately, Xiao Yan was like a two colored falling star as he smashed into the dense forest of the mountain where one could not see the edge.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Yun Shan, I, Xiao Yan, will imprint this palm today into my heart. In the future, I will make you pay ten times for this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The body swiftly fell into the deep mountain while that thick laugh of Xiao Yan still reverberated in the sky above the square. The killing intent contained in the laughter caused a chill in some of the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s disciples to surge forth.</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s face was green as he watched the spot where Xiao Yan had disappeared. He waved his hand. His cold cry echoed throughout the sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the Deacons and Elders in the Misty Cloud Sect listen up! Lead your groups and immediately enter the deep regions of the mountain. Find Xiao Yan. There is a special mark which I have left in his body. He will definitely be unable to escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCapture him, dead or alive!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

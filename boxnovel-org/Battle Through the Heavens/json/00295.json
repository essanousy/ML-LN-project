Occasionally, Ao Tuo would tilt his head and glance at the calm faced young man who was smiling. His gaze was somewhat strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you keep staring at me?\u201d After walking for some distance, Xiao Yan could not endure Ao Tuo\u2019s gaze. Finally, he helplessly shook his head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I am just trying to figure out how many things you, little fellow, are hiding. You are actually able to cause everyone to be so shocked\u2026\u201d Ao Tuo said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan could only helplessly shrug his shoulders.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith your performance being so eye catching this time around, I think that old fellow, Qi Mi Er, will definitely come to me to inquire about your background pretty soon. Although he does not know your actual ability, just being able to refine the \u2018Black Iron Spiritual Leaf\u2019 eight times when you are only around twenty years old is something that could be counted with one hand since the association was founded.\u201d Ao Tuo said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know\u2026\u201d As Xiao Yan slowly walked, he nodded his head. During the refining of the \u2018Black Iron Spiritual Leaf\u2019, he had also considered all of this. However, the Grand Meeting was about to begin. Revealing his ability was something that had to be done sooner or later. Therefore, there was no necessity to purposefully perform poorly here. Although keeping a low profile was good, if it was overdone, the disdain and the mocking gazes really caused Xiao Yan to feel entangled and helpless.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will have to trouble Grandmaster Ao Tuo to help me keep anything related to my identity a secret.\u201d Xiao Yan pursed up his lips and softly said, \u201cDue to some issues, if my identity is exposed, it is very likely that I would be unable to participate in this Grand Meeting. Therefore, I would like Grandmaster to try your best to help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the serious consequence that Xiao Yan had mentioned, Ao Tuo was at a loss. He immediately knit his eyebrows tightly together. If Xiao Yan were to withdraw from the competition, it would result in the Black Rock City\u2019s Alchemist Association losing a chance to obtain a good result. This threat had a very significant weight toward Ao Tuo who had not had any great contributions ever since he came into his position.</p><br/><p>Ao Tuo frowned tightly and mused for a long while before nodding his head. He smiled bitterly and said, \u201cAlright. I will try my best to help you keep it a secret. It is good that the member information has yet to be submitted. I can still change it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, then thank you very much, Grandmaster Ao Tuo.\u201d Hearing his words, Xiao Yan sighed in relief and replied along with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no choice. I don\u2019t want the competitor that I had a difficult time finding to just run away.\u201d Ao Tuo helplessly said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He was about to say something when Frank\u2019s clear laughter suddenly sounded in front of them, \u201cHey, Old Ao. How was it? Has the test ended? How did the little fellow do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Currently, Xiao Yan and Ao Tuo had already walked out of the corridor. Since this was an intersection, the human flow here was quite significant. When they heard Frank\u2019s laughter, there were quite a number of curious people who immediately slowed their footsteps and threw their gazes at Xiao Yan, who was walking together with Ao Tuo. As the test before was an internal one, these alchemists did not know the exact results of the competition. However, they were able to know that the people who were able to participate in that internal test were mostly seeded competitors in this Grand Meeting and their abilities were extraordinary.</p><br/><p>Hearing the laughter, Xiao Yan raised his head and eyed Frank who was striding over with a smile. Following beside him was the icy looking Xue Mei, who was wearing a silver colored dress and Ling Fei. At the moment, their gazes were a little curious as they too, shot them toward Xiao Yan. Clearly, they were very curious as to what kind of result Xiao Yan was able to obtain at a test of this level.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I have barely managed to pass\u2026\u201d Seeing the three people who had arrived in front of him, Xiao Yan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ao Tuo at the side rolled his eyes. If this kind of result was considered just passable, then wouldn\u2019t the rest of the people fail?</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you passed? That\u2019s good. I was originally still a little worried. After all, those fellows who participate in the internal test aren\u2019t ordinary people.\u201d Frank said with another smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you. This time around, you are representing our Black Rock City. Although I don\u2019t expect you to surpass the geniuses around Liu Ling\u2019s level, you need to at least get into the top ten for this kind of internal test in order for you to gain the possibility of attaining a good result at the Grand Meeting. Just simply passable is inadequate\u2026\u201d Ling Fei muttered. Clearly, she thought the passable that Xiao Yan had mentioned would be the kind that barely met the grade needed to pass.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiu Ling may be a genius, but he is after all the disciple of the Pill-King. Moreover, he is a little older than Xiao\u2026 Yan Xiao. Having received such a result is already quite good. At the very least, we don\u2019t even have the qualification to obtain this kind of result.\u201d It appeared that because Xiao Yan helped put in some good words on her behalf on the matter of the \u2018Peach Blossom Flame\u2019 the last time around, Xue Mei glanced at Ling Fei and said faintly, \u201cI know that you hero worship that Liu Ling, but Yan Xiao is someone from our side. If he loses, our Black Rock City\u2019s reputation will suffer.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have only said this because he is the representative from our Black Rock City\u2026 and did not say much about him\u2026 what does this have to do with Liu Ling?\u201d Ling Fei said resentfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, alright. The both of you should quiet down.\u201d Seeing this pair of enemies, Ao Tuo helplessly shook his head. He faced Frank and said with a grin, \u201cWhen you hear what happened, you will likely be shocked until your jaws drop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? What happened?\u201d Frank was stunned as he uncertainly asked.</p><br/><p>Ao Tuo silently smiled. He was about to open his mouth when a commotion occurred in the corridor behind him. They turned around to take a look. It appeared that the commotion was caused by the competitors that were participating in the test who had successively come out. The two people right at the front were coincidentally the Little Princess and the somewhat gloomy faced Liu Ling.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that Liu Ling? Pill-King Grandmaster Gu He\u2019s disciple? His presence is indeed extraordinary.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a tier three alchemist at such a young age. Ah, he really causes people\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that the one with the best result for the test would undoubtedly be him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe does have such a good teacher\u2026 There\u2019s no point being envious over it.\u201d Eyeing the group of people that had walked out from the corridor, the surrounding people immediately began to engage in their private conversations.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan tilted his head and eyed Liu Ling, who was walking over. He smiled.</p><br/><p>Walking out of the corridor with a gloomy face, Liu Ling spotted the familiar back with one glance. The corner of his mouth twitched a little. He then inhaled a deep breath of air. Instantly, the emotions on his face swiftly disappeared. Replacing it was that feminine smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Yan Xiao congratulations.\u201d Liu Ling walked forward. He first bowed and greeted Ao Tuo and Frank before turning his head to speak to Xiao Yan, with a smile plastered on his face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shook his head. \u201cI was lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have something to do and it is not convenient for me to converse any longer, Mister Yan Xiao, let us meet at the Grand Meeting tomorrow.\u201d Liu Ling clearly was not in the mood to chat now. After he greeted them, he lifted his feet and quickly moved passed Xiao Yan\u2019s group. After which, he passed through the crowd and disappeared from everyone\u2019s sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Yan Xiao.\u201d After following Liu Ling and taking a few steps forward, Little Princess suddenly paused. She hesitated a moment before turning around and said with a smile to Xiao Yan, \u201cThere is a gathering tonight where many alchemists will be attending, You\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I\u2019m sorry. I still have something to do tonight and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t have the time\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan was a little stunned at this olive branch that the Little Princess suddenly extended toward him. He immediately understood the true reasoning, shook his head and smiled as he replied.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s rejection was not beyond Little Princess\u2019s expectations. Her lips moved a little. After staring at Xiao Yan for a moment, she finally said with another smile, \u201cSince it\u2019s like this, then I will not force you. In the future, if Mister Yan Xiao needs any help, you can come and look for me. Goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan pursed up his lips as he eyed the Little Princess who slowly disappeared from the edge of his sight. He recalled her attitude toward him before the test and took a look at the situation again. He could not help but smile bitterly as he said in his heart, \u201cShe is indeed a person from the imperial family. In her eyes, the difference between someone useful and someone who is not actually makes such a big difference in treatment.</p><br/><p>After watching Liu Ling disappear, Ling Fei, who still had stars in her pupils, finally turned around. She eyed Xiao Yan and asked doubtfully, \u201cThat\u2019s right? Why did he congratulate you just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He did not think that winning over Liu Ling was something very great. Although he was Gu He\u2019s disciple, but to Xiao Yan, who had once dared to treat Gu He and Queen Medusa as fish and pearl while he acted as a fisherman, this little fame did not cause him to feel the slightest awe.</p><br/><p>TL: Take advantage of Gu He and Queen Medusa\u2019s fight to benefit</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, I also have some things to do. I will take my leave first. Let\u2019s meet again at tomorrow\u2019s Grand Meeting.\u201d Without giving Ling Fei a chance to continue to inquire further, Xiao Yan smiled at Ao Tuo and the others. He cupped his hands together before swiftly walking out of the association.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe internal test just now was to refine the \u2018Black Iron Spiritual Leaf\u2019.\u201d Watching Xiao Yan\u2019s hurrying back, Ao Tuo touched his white beard and suddenly said a moment later.</p><br/><p>\u201cRefining the \u2018Black Iron Spiritual Leaf\u2019? That seems quite difficult. That thing is almost the hardest ingredient among the middle-grade ingredients to refine. With my current ability, I would at most be able to refine it eight or nine times.\u201d Hearing his words, Frank was surprised as he turned his head and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, that\u2019s right.\u201d Ao Tuo smiled and nodded his head. He faced the spot where Liu Ling disappeared and fondled his chin. \u201cThat Little Fellow refined it six times.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSix times?\u201d Hearing Ao Tuo\u2019s words, Frank\u2019s face was immediately filled with shock. He clicked his tongue and praised, \u201cHow incredible. At such an age, he was actually able to achieve that many refinements. He really is worthy of being Gu He\u2019s disciple.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat thing\u2026 I seem to be only able to refine two times. Ling Fei is around the same as me. That Liu Ling\u2019s talent is really extraordinary.\u201d Xue Mei at the side sighed gently as she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee. That is only natural. The most outstanding person among the Jia Ma Empire\u2019s younger generation alchemists is undoubtedly no one but him.\u201d Ling Fei smiled and said. Seeing her manner, it appeared that she was really worshipped Liu Ling.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, that may not necessarily be true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ao Tuo smiled and shook his head. Seeing Ling Fei\u2019s angry eyes staring at him, he said with a grin, \u201cAlthough Liu Ling is extremely outstanding, Yan Xiao is not any worse compared to him. In the test just now, Liu Ling refined six times while Yan Xiao did it eight times!\u201d</p><br/><p>These words of Ao Tuo were undoubtedly like a thunderbolt, causing Frank\u2019s expression to instantly stiffen. Eight times? That was an extent that required a tier four alchemist in order to achieve. Yet Xiao Yan, as a tier two alchemist, was actually able to achieve this? How was this possible?</p><br/><p>\u201cTeac\u2026 Teacher, you\u2026 you are joking right?\u201d Ling Fei recovered from her shock as she awkwardly said. She had great difficulty believing that Xiao Yan was actually, ridiculously stronger than Liu Ling.</p><br/><p>On one side, Xue Mei also widened her red lips. Her icy expression was at the moment, somewhat shocked. Although she had never underestimated Xiao Yan, she had never thought that he would be able to attain such an eye catching result.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Ao. Is what you said true?\u201d Fu Lan Ke stared at Ao Tuo intently. His face revealed an unrestrained joy. The more outstanding Xiao Yan\u2019s performance was, the greater the benefit to the Black Rock City\u2019s branch.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little fellow hides his ability absurdly deep. Suddenly, I have began to anticipate the Grand Meeting this time around.\u201d Ao Tuo smiled as he eyed the spot where Xiao Yan had disappeared from. He said, \u201cDuring this Grand Meeting, Yan Xiao may well be the largest black horse!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

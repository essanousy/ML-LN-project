In Wu Tang City, there were virtually no other powers that could rival the three great clans.</p><br/><p>Once again, Xiao Zhan half-heartedly said a few words to the nearby Ao Ba Pa. Suddenly, Xiao Zhan\u2019s movements stiffened and his footsteps halted.</p><br/><p>Looking at Xiao Zhan\u2019s movements, everyone shifted their gazes to his line of sight, and their bodies could not help but tremble slightly. Even Jie Lie Bi and Ao Ba Pa\u2019s faces changed a bit.</p><br/><p>At the hall\u2019s other entrance, three figures slowly walked out. The person leading them was unexpectedly Primer Auction House\u2019s chief auctioneer Ya Fei. As frequent customers of the auction, Xiao Zhan and others all knew this woman\u2019s true face. Although this woman usually puts on an appearance filled with smiles, everyone knew that this woman was actually very arrogant. Previously, Ao Ba Pa wanted to invite her to have a meal but was directly met with an exceptionally \u201cpolite\u201d refusal. From this incident, people understood that this woman, unlike her outward appearance, was not easy to get close to.</p><br/><p>Today however, this haughty woman, contrary to her normal self, was respectfully guiding guests. This really did make Xiao Zhan and the others amazed.</p><br/><p>Eyes blinking a little, Xiao Zhan and the others\u2019 gaze shifted once more to the rear and their faces continued to change.</p><br/><p>At the back of the group of three, the Auction\u2019s alchemist elder Gu Ni was smiling and said a few words into the ears of a mysterious black-hooded person. His smiling expression was all over his face, so much so that a trace of flattery could be seen.</p><br/><p>If Ya Fei\u2019s deferential attitude had caused Xiao Zhan and the others to feel amazed, then the attitude Gu Ni displayed made them feel stunned.</p><br/><p>As Wu Tan City\u2019s highest ranked alchemist, usually only the three clan heads could meet him. When they did, they were respectful and did not dare to be impolite in the slightest.</p><br/><p>As a 2nd tier alchemist, Gu Ni maintained that pride of being an alchemist. When he spoke, he spoke indifferently, making others revere him even more.</p><br/><p>But this type of person, he unexpectedly showed such respect without even trying to hide his flattering smiles. That \u2026 \u2026 that person he\u2019s trying to win the favor of.. Who could this person be?</p><br/><p>The sight brought shock. Finally, their gazes slowly shifted onto the center\u2019s black-cloaked figure.</p><br/><p>Sweeping over the shadowy figure\u2019s plump stature, Xiao Zhan anxiously thought in his mind, \u201cWho is this person? Someone who can make Primer Auction House\u2019s most important people respectfully send him off? What would a person of this level come to Wu Tan City for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Licking his somewhat dry lips, Xiao Zhan looked around from left to right and actually found that Jia Lie Bi and Ao Ba Pa were also curious and shocked.</p><br/><p>Raising his eyes expectantly at the three incoming people, Xiao Zhan\u2019s face squeezed out a small smile, walked forward two steps, and smiled: \u201cLady Ya Fei, Gu Ni elder. Ha ha. It really is rare to see you two appear together.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Ya Fei and Gu Ni came out earlier, the two had already caught sight of the clan leaders. Looking at Xiao Zhan coming out to speak, their movements were still the same. But only after the black-cloaked person stopped did they heave a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. We\u2019re sending off a precious guest, that\u2019s all.\u201d Ya Fei lightly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh. Ha ha\u2026\u201d Jia Lie Bi also approached smiling. Shortly after, his gaze shifted from Ya Fei to the black-hooded person and politely asked: \u201cHa ha. I don\u2019t know if this mister \u2026 \u2026 is also from Wu Tang City? Ha ha, you look somewhat unfamiliar to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCough \u2026 Jia Lie Clan Elder, this mister is Primer Auction House\u2019s precious guest \u2026 \u2026.\u201d Gu Ni elder\u2019s eyebrows furrowed and coughed to warn Jia Lie Bi to not ask questions carelessly .</p><br/><p>Hearing Gu Ni elder\u2019s warning tone, Jia Lie Bi\u2019s complexion slightly changed and whispered to himself: \u201cEven Gu Ni elder acts this fearfully? What is this person\u2019s identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how Jia Lie Bi was met with a tactful retort, Xiao Zhan swallowed what he was about to say. Looking at Gu Ni\u2019s cautious stance, this black-cloaked person was obviously on a completely different level of existence from them. At the moment, he had no choice but to laugh a bit and then tactfully withdraw.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou \u2026. \u2026. are Xiao Zhan of the Xiao Clan, right?\u201d Just when Xiao Zhan was about to withdraw, the silent black-cloaked person suddenly asked in a dull tone.</p><br/><p>Hearing this elderly voice, Xiao Zhan stared blankly a bit. Soon after, he hesitated and then nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the young master of your clan relied on this Foundation Elixir to leap to the 9th Duan Qi. Ha ha, this really causes me to be in awe.\u201d The black-cloaked person laughed dully.</p><br/><p>Met with this sort of courteous treatment, Xiao Zhan felt delight in his heart and smiled: \u201cMy son has good luck.\u201d</p><br/><p>Waving his hands in a carefree manner, the black-cloaked person smiled: \u201cLuck is also part of one\u2019s power. In the future if there is ever an opportunity, I would like to meet him. Maybe he can even become an alchemist.\u201d</p><br/><p>In a somewhat stunned manner, Xiao Zhan appeared as if he did not understand what the elder was saying.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk\u2026. \u2026. in the future if there is ever an opportunity, I will look for your Xiao Clan to collaborate together.\u201d Smiling, the black-cloaked person turned around to face Ya Fei and Gu Ni: \u201cThere\u2019s no need to send me off, I still have some business to do. I will leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking, Xiao Yan didn\u2019t wait for their reactions and walked in big strides out of the auction house.</p><br/><p>Stroking his face in an ineffable way, Xiao Zhan turned his head and actually saw Ya Fei and Gu Ni staring at him, faces filled with envy.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Clan Leader, do you recognize that old mister?\u201d Ya Fei asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was my first time seeing him.\u201d Xiao Zhan forced a smile and shook his head nervously towards Ya Fei and Gu Ni, who held strange expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cSigh, the Xiao family has been blessed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Ni gently shook his head. He shot a glance at the Foundation Elixirs, which Jia Lie Bi held tightly to his chest as if they were precious treasures, and said indifferently: \u201cThose things were refined by him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having heard what was said, the complexions of the three family heads changed wildly.</p><br/><p>After a short while, Xiao Zhan\u2019s face lit up with delight; he hadn\u2019t expected that the black-cloaked elder would be an alchemist. Looking at Gu Ni\u2019s previous attitude, it was clear that the elder was a much higher ranked alchemist than even Gu Ni!</p><br/><p>If a second tier alchemist was able to make them courteous and modest, then what about a third or even a fourth tier alchemist?</p><br/><p>Heavens, his kind of clan did not have the qualifications to even meet this type of senior.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve profited greatly this time\u2026.\u201d Thinking back to when that black-hooded person offered to collaborate in the future, Xiao Zhan\u2019s two eyes immediately lit up and he involuntarily mumbled to himself.</p><br/><p>To the side, after their shock faded, Jia Lie Bi and Ao Ba Pa\u2019s eyes flashed with envy as if they were like rabbit\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>TL: Rabbit eyes are red = red eyes = envy</p><br/>\n</div>"}

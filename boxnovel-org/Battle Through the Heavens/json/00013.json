He curled his fists and stared coldly at the calm and impassive young man before him.</p><br/><p>Jia Lie Ao\u2019s underlings, seeing that their young master was quite angry, quickly walked forward and surrounded both, Xiao Yan and Xiao Xun. Their gazes revealing their bad intentions.</p><br/><p>Even though it was deep within the market, there were still quite a few people around and they turned their questioning gazes towards the surrounded group. Xiao Yan and Jia Lie Ao had quite a reputation in Wu Tang City, Xiao Yan for his fall from genius to cripple and Jia Lie Ao for his less than honorable encounters with other women. Even though they were infamous, they were still well known within the city.</p><br/><p>Looking Jia Lie Ao\u2019s group\u2019s movements, Xiao Yan\u2019s brow jumped and on his young face, a hint of confidence creeped. Lightly turning his head, he whistled towards a spot within the market.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s actions, everyone turned their head to the direction in which Xiao Yan whistled and saw the market\u2019s guards furiously coming over under the lead of Pei En.</p><br/><p>With his fellow guards, Pei En rushed towards Xiao Yan and quickly, the market\u2019s guards surrounded Jia Lie Ao\u2019s underlings who were surrounding Xiao Yan and Xiao Xun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird young master, anything wrong?\u201d Walking up to Xiao Yan, Pei En swept his glance over Jia Lie Ao and then respectfully asked Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lightly smiles and turned to face the green-faced Jia Lie Ao. He nonchalantly said: \u201cJia Lie Ao young master, this market is controlled by Xiao Clan, are you sure you want to fight here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Lie Ao\u2019s eyes revealed his fear for Pei En but he immediately sneered at Xiao Yan: \u201cDo you only know to rely on your clan? If you are a man\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat you want to say is, if I am a man then I would fight you one on one. Right?\u201d Xiao Yan waved his hand and cut Jia Lie Ao off.</p><br/><p>Jia Lie Ao sneered again and with a hint of challenge, he said: \u201cYup, are you afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the arrogant face of Jia Lie Ao, Xiao Yan helplessly sighed and puts his hand up to feel his forehead. Moments later, he raised his head and shrugs his shoulder and with innocence and naivety, he asked: \u201cJia Lie Ao young master, I would like to ask, how old are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The edge of Jia Lie Ao\u2019s mouth twitched and he doesn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig guy, you\u2019re already twenty one. How old am I? Fifteen! You\u2019re actually asking a kid that hasn\u2019t performed his coming of age ritual to fight you? Don\u2019t you feel that your request is over the top, don\u2019t you feel embarrassed?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s innocent appearance was so realistic that Xun Er beside him couldn\u2019t help but let out a soft laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the young man\u2019s words, the mercenary and merchant stall owners also let out laughs. Xiao Yan was right, at his current age, Xiao Yan could only be considered a kid but Jia Lie Ao would be considered an adult. A challenge of this kind made everyone look down upon Jia Lie Ao.</p><br/><p>The laughter of the crowd was like a bucket of cold water and helped Jia Lie Ao regain his calm. From Xiao Yan\u2019s maturity and calmness to his impassive attitude, it was extremely easy for people to forget how old he really was. Therefore, after Xiao Yan said his age, Jia Lie Ao finally remembered that the young man standing in front of him was only fifteen.</p><br/><p>Gnashing his teeth, Jia Lie Ao looked at the leering guards behind Xiao Yan and realized that he didn\u2019t have any chance of retaliation today. He could only shake his head and coldly say: \u201cOne more year and you\u2019ll be undergoing the coming of age ritual right? Hehe, I think that someone as crippled as you, once you finish the coming of age ritual, will only be sent to some remote and poor village. At that time, you won\u2019t even have the power to enter Wu Tang City, pretty pitiful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lightly smiles and nonchalantly shrugs his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Jia Lie Ao\u2019s eyelids flickered. He didn\u2019t know why but whenever he saw the calm face of the young man in front of him, a mysterious rage boiled within him. You\u2019re only a cripple and trying to act like you know everything\u2026</p><br/><p>Forcefully suppressing his anger, Jia Lie Ao let out a cold hmph and with a wave of his hand, commands his underlings to exit the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh right\u2026.\u201d His steps stopping, Jia Lie Ao seemed to have remembered something and turning back, he said: \u201c Xiao Yan young master, I heard that your Xiao Clan had their marriage with the Nalan Clan revoked. Hehe, actually, that isn\u2019t unexpected. With your Qi talent, you just can\u2019t match the Miss Nalan. Haha\u2026\u201d After saying that, Jia Lie Ao left laughing.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze coldly followed the exit of Jia Lie Ao. Tightly holding Xun Er who was about to rush out, he quietly said: \u201cHe\u2019s just a mad dog.If he bites you, why should you bite back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut he.. went too far. We can\u2019t just let him off like this?\u201d Her eyebrows furrowing, Xun Er\u00a0indignantly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere will always be an opportunity\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smirked and the coldness coming from his voice made Pei En shuddered. A lion\u2019s bite might not be that scary but a lion that knows patience is another story, a scary one\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Pei En, sorry for troubling you.\u201d Xiao Yan turned back and smiled gently toward Pei En\u2019s group. The previously intense atmosphere all of a sudden changed into a lighthearted mood.</p><br/><p>Impressed by the control over emotions that Xiao Yan exercised, Pei En\u2019s smile was reinforced by a sense of respect. Even with Xiao Yan\u2019s lack of talent, Xiao Yan\u2019s future accomplishments probably wouldn\u2019t be too shabby with his mental prowess.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, third young master\u2019s joking. This is Xiao Clan\u2019s territory, we wouldn\u2019t allow Jia Lie Clan to do as they please here.\u201d Pei Em smiled and seeing that Xiao Yan started to look around, he quickly took his leave along with his men.</p><br/><p>Looking at the exiting Pei En and his group, Xiao Yan turned around and ruffled Xun Er\u2019s hair and said slightly forcefully: \u201cA level 1 monster core made you forget your morals? You know as well as I do what kind of person Jia Lie Ao is. The moment you take his stuff, he would definitely ask for favors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Straightening her hair, Xun Er flipped her hands upwards: \u201cHe wanted to give it me, it was free.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan rolled his eyes and didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry: \u201cIt isn\u2019t like that\u2019s something precious, did you really need to act like that? Don\u2019t forget, you\u2019re the young genius in Xiao Clan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er wrinkles her nose and raised the bracelet on her wrist. She taunted: \u201cSo Xiao Yan ge-ge has also been noticing Xun Er.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stayed silent and pulling on Xun Er\u2019s hand, they walked towards some stalls deeper in the market\u2026</p><br/><p>After walking past quite a few stalls, Xiao Yan\u2019s feet finally stopped. He bent down and stared at a green orb that still had a trace of blood on the stall and said: \u201cI\u2019ve finally found it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Moving his hand across the stall, Xiao Yan\u2019s was about to grab the monster core when his hand stiffened. A strange foreboding struck his mind\u2026</p><br/><p>Licking his lips, Xiao Yan continued to pick up the monster core but his gaze, as if by accident, swept across the stall\u2026.</p><br/><p>Moments later, his gaze landed on a piece of black metal that was displayed beside the monster core.</p><br/><p>The Black Metal Piece seemed extremely old with many specks of rust and even a couple spots of dirt. It looked as if it had just been excavated.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Yan Brat, buy the black metal piece, it\u2019s something good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Right when Xiao Yan was confused about why he felt such a strong feeling towards the seemingly worthless metal, Yao Lao\u2019s voice sounded in his mind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

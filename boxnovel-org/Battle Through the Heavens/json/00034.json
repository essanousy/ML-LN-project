However, they didn\u2019t try to do anything else against Xiao Yan. The potential displayed by Xiao Yan gave them a sense of defeat. 4 Duan Qi in 1 year was something that would make anyone shocked, their sons and grandsons, wouldn\u2019t hope to ever have that pace.</p><br/><p>With a light heart, Xiao Zhan clapped while announcing: \u201cXiao Ke zhi-er has lost. Hopefully you will continue to train hard!\u201d</p><br/><p>TL: Zhi-er is Nephew in Chinese</p><br/><p>In the training field, the pale faced Xiao Ke heard the announcement and drooped his head in disappointment. Taking a look at the black clothed young man not far from him, he recalled about how he had insulted the very person, calling him a \u201ccripple\u201d just a year ago. Now one year later, the \u201ccripple\u201d was quite close to the top of the clan and far above him. This extreme difference made Xiao Ke recall the words he had heard in the hall just a few months before: \u201c Thirty years east, thirty years west, don\u2019t you dare bully me because I\u2019m poor now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shaking his head with a bitter smile, Xiao Ke got up with some difficulty. Slightly bowing to Xiao Yan, Xiao Ke\u2019s voice had lost all of its arrogance from before: \u201cXiao Yan Biao-di, you won. Congratulations on your recovery!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nodding, Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze slowly swept across the training field and those that met his dark pupils all turned away their gaze with nervousness and unease.</p><br/><p>His gaze pausing on Xiao Mei who was staring at him, Xiao Yan twisted his face to face the clansmen that didn\u2019t pass and asked with a smile: \u201cIs there anyone else who\u00a0would like to challenge me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching Xiao Yan, the clansmen that were eager to challenge Xiao Yan before Xiao Ke went up all closed their mouths and looked up at the sky as if Xiao Yan\u2019s words had nothing to do with them. None of them would go up and be the second challenger.</p><br/><p>Watching the childish acts of pretending to be a fool, Xiao Yan lightly shrugged and walked back.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan sit beside her, Xun Er smiled while examining the field. Picking up a strand of her hair and twirling it, she whispered: \u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, three years ago, they looked at you like this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThree years ago, I would have been excited by their respectful and fearful gazes but today\u2026 I don\u2019t feel anything.\u201d Xiao Yan touched his nose and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen Xiao Yan ge-ge has matured!\u201d Xun Er playfully blinked her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot more mature than you. Sometimes I feel as if there\u2019s a thousand year monster hiding within you!\u201d Being called mature by a girl, Xiao Yan couldn\u2019t help but laugh. Intimately rubbing Xun Er\u2019s head, he let out a smile.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Xun Er gave Xiao Yan an evil eye and her delicate face showed an expression of rebuke. No matter how carefree a girl was, no one ever liked being called an old monster.</p><br/><p>Xun Er\u2019s expression of rebuke was so pretty that it attracted the stares of the young men around her and even the stares of some of the girls!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat brat, too pompous\u2026\u201d Xiao Ning, like the others, was also attracted to Xun Er\u2019s expression of rebuke but looking at the intimate chatter between Xun Er and Xiao Yan, an envious flame burned within him. His jealousy covered up his reasoning as he thought that only he could match Xun Er within the entire clan but thinking back, he realized that no matter what he did, Xun Er rarely smiled. On the other hand, Xiao Yan, who was a \u201ccripple\u201d, could always make Xun Er laugh. The difference between them made Xiao Ning crush his teeth in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, I\u2019ll let you be arrogant for now but when the Coming of Age Ceremony comes, I will make you look for your fallen teeth in front of Xun Er!\u201d Clenching his hands into fits, Xiao Ning gave a cold stare to the cross-legged Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Even though Xiao Ning was also shocked by Xiao Yan\u2019s training speed in the past year, he couldn\u2019t change his haughty manner that he was used to. In addition, Xiao Ning, being the only male within the entire clan that could barely be compared to Xun Er, felt a sense of danger from Xiao Yan's sudden performance.</p><br/><p>Before he grows strong, I\u2019ll give him a merciless beating. The best case scenario is that the beating would leave a scar and break him from his training!</p><br/><p>While thinking his evil thoughts, the corners of Xiao Ning\u2019s mouth curved into a smile. Even though Xiao Yan was at 7 Duan Qi, Xiao Ning was still confident in his 8 Duan Qi. After all, each Duan of Qi after 7 Duan Qi had a huge difference between them!</p><br/><p>Chatting in a low voice with Xun Er, Xiao Yan\u2019s aimlessly sight gazed around the sides of the training field and caught the smile on Xiao Ning\u2019s face. Thinking for a moment, Xiao Yan realized what the smile was about and smiled himself, thinking: Someone who can\u2019t even cover up his or her emotions can\u2019t pose to be a risk at all.</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>After Xiao Ke lost to Xiao Yan, no one else dared to challenge Xiao Yan who was sitting down and those clansmen that didn\u2019t qualify set their sights on others. But after a couple rounds of challenges, only two people, relying on luck and familiar Dou Techniques, were able to beat their opponent and qualify for the Coming of Age Ceremony.</p><br/><p>Watching the slowly calming training field, the smiling Xiao Zhan stood up and announced the results along with a couple of notices about next month\u2019s Coming of Age Ceremony.</p><br/><p>Slowly standing up, Xiao Yan smiled towards the happy Xiao Zhan on the stage while Xiao Zhan wasn\u2019t stingy about giving his qualified son, a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>Right after dusting off his clothes, Xiao Yan detected a perfumed scent.</p><br/><p>Curling his brows slightly, Xiao Yan lifted his head to see Xiao Mei standing in front of him and asked: \u201cDo you need anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the impassiveness and coldness on Xiao Yan\u2019s face, Xiao Mei\u2019s courage faltered as she forced out a smiled and said: \u201cXiao Yan biao-di, congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d Slightly nodding, Xiao Yan glanced at Xun Er besides him.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan biao-di, my father will be personally teaching a High Huang level Dou Technique at the Dou Technique Hall tomorrow. Do you want to come with me?\u201d Xiao Mei smiled and her combination of a female\u2019s charm and a youth\u2019s delicacy created an irresistible question.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Xiao Yan\u2019s brows slightly jumped.</p><br/><p>Right when Xiao Yan was about to find an excuse to reject Xiao Mei, a pale white arm slipped through and locked with his arm.</p><br/><p>Shocked, Xiao Yan turned around to find a smiling Xun Er.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally sorry Xiao Mei biao-jie, Xun Er has already invited Xiao Yan ge-ge to accompany me tomorrow to visit Wu Tan City and so he can\u2019t be going with Xiao Mei biao-jie to the Dou Technique Hall.\u201d Under stunned stares, Xun Er held on to Xiao Yan\u2019s arm while a hint of apology lingered on her delicate face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He really did not expect this fellow to have taken half a step into the Dou Zong class within these past two years. Although Han Feng currently only had half a foot into the class, anyone knew that as long as one had half a foot in then one was already not very far from fully attaining that class.</p><br/><p>This half a foot would also allow Han Feng to far exceed an ordinary peak Dou Huang expert. Adding the collaboration with his \u2018Sea Heart Flame\u2019, it was likely that his fighting strength would be truly able to stand shoulder to shoulder with a true elite Dou Zong!</p><br/><p>Despite the great increase in Xiao Yan\u2019s current strength, he still possessed quite a great pressure when faced with such a powerful fighting strength. A strength that could stand shoulder to shoulder with a Dou Zong was something that no one could easily underestimate.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring these past two years, you are the first person who has caused me to completely reveal my strength.\u201d The Dou Qi wings on Han Feng\u2019s back slowly disappeared as Han Feng\u2019s feet stepped in the air and spoke faintly to Xiao Yan. Remaining in the empty air without any support. This was something that only an elite Dou Zong could perform. At such a level, the sky would be just like flat land. One\u2019s agility and one\u2019s reaction would be increased by a couple of levels when fighting with others.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes and stared at Han Feng who was suspended in the sky. He slowly exhaled and said, \u201cYou are merely someone who has half a foot in the Dou Zong class. Is it worth it for you to act so proud and arrogant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the very least, it is sufficient to finish you off\u2026 stubborn-mouthed \u2018junior\u2019!\u201d Han Feng flipped his hand, and a cluster of substance-like majestic Dou Qi writhed unceasingly in his hand. The energy ripples that faintly seeped out caused the space around him to shake.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled coldly. The dark-green flame in his hand suddenly rose and was shrouded as they attacked. With a pull of his hand, the dark-green flame was split apart, and transformed into two clusters of flame. One was green and the other was invisible.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s left hand held the green flame, while his right hand held the invisible flame. He raised his head and watched Han Feng, whose expression had turned extremely ugly at this moment. He smiled and said, \u201cWeren\u2019t you very uncertain as to how my \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 had changed? Now, you might be able to guess the answer, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFallen Heart Flame!\u201d Han Feng\u2019s eyes stared intently at the cluster of invisible flame in Xiao Yan\u2019s right hand. His teeth gnashing voice carried threads of cold wind as each word spilled out from his mouth. Only at this moment was the doubt in his heart completely settled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you have actually refined the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019?\u201d The majestic Dou Qi that lingered on Han Feng\u2019s body writhed intensely, much like the interior of his heart. A moment later, a furious and disbelieving voice was finally emitted from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, you have guessed correctly\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan raised his brows and spoke mockingly toward Han Feng whose face was as dark and solemn as the sky before a storm. The dark solemn expression on Han Feng\u2019s face began showing the trend of evolving into a much more ferocious state.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow unexpected. It is really unexpected that did the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 not kill you, but also allowed you to achieve a great deal! That jade-green flame of yours is actually the merger of the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 and the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. No wonder\u2026 No wonder it has the ability to divide my \u2018Sea Heart Flame\u2019!\u201d Han Feng\u2019s dark, solemn voice carried a powerful pressuring Dou Qi as it enveloped Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 is really a good thing. Hee hee. You have once again allowed me to recognize its value. Therefore, I will use all means, fair or foul to obtain it!\u201d Han Feng\u2019s hands danced wildly as a craziness faintly appeared on his face. \u201cHowever, so what if you possess two kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019? Do you possess the ability to perfectly control their strength? My strength far surpasses yours. As long as I defeat you, the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019, \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019, \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019, all of them will be mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLunatic\u2026 I\u2019m afraid that you don\u2019t have that ability.\u201d An arc was lifted on the corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth. A ridiculing smile appeared within his eyes as he shook his head slightly. He slowly raised his right hand and aimed at Han Feng. The invisible flame immediately began to ripple\u2026</p><br/><p>The body of the crazy faced Han Feng not far away suddenly trembled as the ripple of the invisible flame became increasingly intense. The majestic Dou Qi on his body swiftly became chaotic. It finally slowly recovered after a couple of blinks. He held his chest, and his gaze looked at Xiao Yan in a dark and gloomy manner, \u201cSummoning Heart Flame?\u201d</p><br/><p>The special effect that gave one the greatest headache was something that Han Feng was also quite afraid of. No one dared to ignore that Heart Flame which no one could sense. After all, the interior of one\u2019s body was ultimately the weakest and most important part of oneself. If one were to receive a slight injury within it, it was likely that it would result in the entire person\u2019s condition taking a blow. Hence, Han Feng swiftly maneuvered a large amount of Dou Qi to suppress it the moment it appeared.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled as he witnessed the majestic Dou Qi on Han Feng\u2019s body become dimmer and paler than before. It appeared that the naughty Heart Flame had caused Han Feng to spend quite a great amount of effort to suppress. In this way, Han Feng\u2019s fighting ability would be reduced somewhat while he was splitting his attention on two things. This was extremely good news for Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to cause me harm by relying on this little Heart Flame?\u201d Han Feng\u2019s face was gloomy and cold as he watched Xiao Yan. The cluster of surging Dou Qi on his hand was also swiftly activated. The powerful energy ripple seeped out at an increasing pace. From the looks of it, this cluster of surging Dou Qi was an extremely strong attack which he brewed!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also sensed this increasingly wild, violently Dou Qi cluster. He immediately clenched his fist and a suction force surged out, sucking that Heavy Xuan Ruler, that was wrapped in dark-green flame suspended in mid-air, into his hand. He let out a deep breath, and the Dou Qi within his body was also being wildly extracted at this moment!</p><br/><p>With the Dou Qi in Xiao Yan\u2019s body unceasingly pouring into the Heavy Xuan Ruler, the dark-black ruler\u2019s body gradually turned into a jade-green color. Moreover, the temperature on it was repeatedly rising.</p><br/><p>The pouring in of the Dou Qi continued until a certain moment before it finally came to a sudden stop. At this moment, the Heavy Xuan Ruler was already like an emerald ruler, appearing extremely beautiful. However, the energy that seeped out of this ruler trembled slightly, causing the surrounding air to become hazy.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan raised his head to observe Han Feng in the distance as he held the ruler\u2019s hilt tightly with both hands. A moment later, a cluster of surging Dou Qi had already unleashed an eye-piercing intense glow that was just like a small scale sun that no one dared to look directly at.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bastard, go and die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng\u2019s eyes stared intently at the cluster of sun-like Dou Qi in his hand. A moment later, he suddenly raised his head. His face was covered with a savage insanity. With a brutal cry, the cluster of majestic sun-like Dou Qi shot explosively toward Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cRadiance Seal!\u201d</p><br/><p>An eye-piercing light drew across the sky. The light faintly revealed a large palm that appeared to be a sun falling from the sky as it carried a frightening energy that caused one\u2019s hairs to stand on end!</p><br/><p>\u201cFlame Splitting Tsunami!\u201d</p><br/><p>The emerald-like Heavy Xuan Ruler was lifted high above Xiao Yan\u2019s head. An instant later, both of his arms suddenly hacked down with great force. A hundred-foot-long emerald energy glow shot out explosively from the tip of the ruler. That stance was as though it wanted to split the ground. Its momentum was frightening!</p><br/><p>The two extremely frightening energies zoomed through the sky like lightning. Finally, they became like two meteorites as they collided violently together in front of a countless number of shocked gazes!</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they came into contact, a frighteningly loud rolling-thunder energy ripple began to set off an energy wave that spread all over the sky, much like a stormy sea.</p><br/><p>The entire area became silent at this moment. The roiling energy waves were earth-shattering. Even the sun that floated high in the sky was shadowed by this energy at this very moment.</p><br/><p>The energy remained in a stalemate for nearly ten minutes before it gradually scattered. Countless numbers of people within the city were still completely silent. Each and every one of their faces contained some shock. If the explosion from those two attacks had occurred in the city, it was likely that this Feng City would have turned into flat land in an extremely short period of time.</p><br/><p>This kind of terrifying destructive force was something that one could rarely see even during a decisive battle between peak Dou Huangs!</p><br/><p>The energy wave that spread through the sky slowly scattered. The two bodies in the sky were slowly revealed. Han Feng was at this moment a little better. Although his hair was messy and his breathing was somewhat hurried, he did not suffer much damage from the backlash of the energy. On the other hand, Xiao Yan\u2019s face was pale-white. Even his breathing had become much weaker during this collision.</p><br/><p>Looking at the gap between the two, it was obvious that Han Feng had the upper hand in this collision.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, junior, it looks like your strength is not as tough as your mouth. Why? Your Dou Qi is exhausted just as we were starting? Looks like this senior has really overestimated you!\u201d Han Feng was also startled when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s pale face. He could not help but laugh out loud.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan glanced at Han Feng who was laughing out loud with a lifted head. The corner of his mouth was curled slightly as he spoke with a faint smile, \u201cIsn\u2019t it a little too early for you to be so happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng revealed a cold laugh filled with disdain when he heard that Xiao Yan still had a tough mouth. He could clearly sense that the other party\u2019s aura had become much weaker. Clearly, he had received quite serious injuries from the collision earlier. However, the smile on his face had not continued for long when it stiffened following Xiao Yan\u2019s subsequent action.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly raised his hand in the distance. A deep-green glow gradually surfaced on his hand. An instant later, the green glow flew out, and a flawless emerald fire lotus the size of a palm immediately surfaced on Xiao Yan\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026 creating this thing still exhausts so much Dou Qi.\u201d Xiao Yan stared at the emerald-like fire lotus before raising his head and laughing at Han Feng, who had suddenly stiffened.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, you will suffer the same loss twice. Looks like I have also overestimated you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Han Feng\u2019s expression had instantly turned extremely ugly!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

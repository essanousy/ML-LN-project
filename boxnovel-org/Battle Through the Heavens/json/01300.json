The figure emitted a rich ferocious aura. His appearance surprisingly resembled the expert from the Ancient Void Dragon tribe, whom Xiao Yan had met, Hei Qing.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld brother Hei Qing\u2026 why have you come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was also startled as this human figure suddenly appeared. His tone was filled with surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, I have come to look for you regarding some matters. Those old fellows from the tribe have dispatched me to find you. Dammit! Fortunately, Zi Yan left a dragon seal on you. Otherwise, I really would have ended up looking for you until I died\u2026\u201d Hei Qing looked at Xiao Yan as though he had found his savior. He hurriedly rushed over and heaved a great sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook for me?\u201d Xiao Yan knit his brows upon hearing this. What matter could lead an Ancient Void Dragon to him? Could it be\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHas something happened to Zi Yan?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly widened as he turned to Hei Qing and asked a question in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is not in trouble. However, there is something that requires your help\u2026 if you have the time, you should leave with me.\u201d Hei Qing rubbed his head as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment when he saw Hei Qing\u2019s somewhat grave expression. After which, he nodded. It seemed that the matter was quite a big one. Otherwise, it would not cause an expert like Hei Qing to be this frantic.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce I resolve the trouble here, I will take a trip with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there some trouble?\u201d Hei Qing recovered only after hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words. He turned his head, took a look, and continued in a stunned manner, \u201cIt is that old soke Mo Yu from the Hall of Souls\u2026 do you remember this uncle Hei Qing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHei Qing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Ninth Tianzun was slightly startled. His expression was gloomy as he suddenly appeared to have remembered something. His expression changed a little as he exclaimed, \u201cYou are Hei Qing from the Ancient Void Dragon tribe?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the name \u2018Hei Qing\u2019 something that an old soke like you can say? With your position as the ninth, you do not possess the qualification to do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Qing wrapped his arms in front of his chest. He curled his mouth and did not give any face to the ninth Tianzun.</p><br/><p>The ninth Tianzun\u2019s face became extremely dark and gloomy when he heard Hei Qing\u2019s rude words. However, he did not reveal any fury because he clearly understood that this large man in front of him was an extremely troublesome fellow. Even he was no match for this person.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis friend. This old self is an Elder of the Profound Sky Sect, Shenluo Guizun. This Xiao Yan is a person that my Profound Sky Sect intends to capture. I hope that this friend will not intervene.\u201d The ninth Tianzun was aware of Hei Qing\u2019s background, but Shenluo Guizun was not. After seeing Xiao Yan gradually fall into a disadvantage, how could they let him just flee, so Shenluo Guizun cupped his hands together and spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cProfound Sky Sect? What is this thing?\u201d Hei Qing knit his brows. He waved his hand somewhat impatiently and said, \u201cAll of you should hurry up and get lost. I am looking for little brother Xiao Yan regarding some matters. Stop wasting this father\u2019s damn time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shenluo Guizun and Yaohua Liangzun\u2019s expressions changed after hearing Hei Qing\u2019s vulgarities. They both furiously cried out, \u201cYou dare to disrespect my Profound Sky Sect? You are seeking death!\u201d</p><br/><p>After their loud cries sounded, the two of them stepped through empty space. Their bodies immediately rushed forward like lightning. Dark and cold Dou Qi violently smashed toward Hei Qing without being held back.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo six star Dou Zuns actually possess the courage to scream in front of this father?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Qing laughed out of anger when he saw the two rushing over and advanced instead of pulling back. Both of his fists tightened and the muscles all over his body fluctuated in a strange manner. Finally, he sent his fists forward without any fancy attacks.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two metal fists smashed out and formed two black spatial marks. The black spatial marks moved quickly before violently colliding with the duo.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what is this fellow\u2019s origin?\u201d</p><br/><p>The bodies of Shenluo Guizun\u2019s group trembled after the collision. Their expressions immediately turned pale. The frightening strength they faced, which seemed to be able to destroy everything, caused a terror to surge from deep within their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug.\u201d</p><br/><p>The terror had just appeared when their throats filled with something sweet. They both spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. Their bodies flew back like kites with their strings broken. They violently shot into the forest below, smashing into the ground and forming a hundred-meter-deep pit. The powerful remnant force completely destroyed the large trees within a hundred meter radius.</p><br/><p>\u201cClap clap\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Qing sent the two flying with a punch from each fist. After which, he patted his hands together. His face was filled with ridicule. His eyes, which contained some ill intent, glanced at the gloomy face of the ninth Tianzun. He said, \u201cMo Yu, are you going to get lost by yourself or shall this father do it for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHei Qing, you should not act so arrogantly. Xiao Yan is someone the hall chief wants to capture. Are you really going to protect him?\u201d Ninth Tianzun coldly demanded.</p><br/><p>Hei Qing narrowed his eyes. He rubbed his hands together as he replied in a faint voice, \u201cThis father doesn\u2019t care about all this. Those old fellows from the clan want me to find Xiao Yan. Since this father is here, everyone should forget about bringing him away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrack.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fury within the eyes of the ninth Tianzun surged. Both of his hands slowly tightened and emitted cracking sounds. Frightening Dou Qi slowly spread from his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wish to fight? Alright, the old me also wishes to see if you have improved after so many years.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Qing coldly chuckled. His body became distorted. It emitted a muffled thunder-like bone explosion. Following the sound of these bones appearing, his body became even larger. An extremely powerful pressure was vaguely emitted from his strong body.</p><br/><p>The ninth Tianzun\u2019s eyes twitched involuntarily when he sensed the pressure. He inhaled a deep breath of air and suppressed the fury within his heart. He was aware that he was no match for Hei Qing with his strength. Even if he attacked, he would not gain an advantage. Moreover, the control over space that an Ancient Void Dragon exhibited was something that no one could match. Even someone stronger than an Ancient Void Dragon would find it difficult to defeat and successfully retain the other party.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei Qing, I don\u2019t believe that you can protect this brat forever!\u201d The ninth Tianzun spoke in a dense tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not up to you to be concerned about this\u2026\u201d Hei Qing glanced at him and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ninth Tianzun coldly snorted. His heart was filled with an unwillingness. It was unexpected that he had successfully avoided Yao Chen, but had ended up attracting someone from the Ancient Void Dragon tribe. He did not expect Xiao Yan to have a relationship with this tribe.</p><br/><p>Since Hei Qing had shown himself, the ninth Tianzun understood that capturing Xiao Yan had become an impossible task. The Ninth Tianzun could only clench his teeth when he thought of this. He stared at Xiao Yan viciously and said, \u201cXiao Yan, you can\u2019t just hide forever. I do not believe that someone will always be there to rescue you!\u201d</p><br/><p>After uttering those words, the ninth Tianzun ceased to remain in this place. He turned around and was just about to leave when Hei Qing suddenly opened his mouth , \u201cMo Yu, when you return, inform those people above you not to go against Xiao Yan and the members of the Xiao clan. The grudges between the Hun (Soul) clan and the Xiao clan have ceased to exist by now. By going overboard, there will come a point in time where all of you will regret it\u2026 these words are not spoken by this father. They are spoken by those old fellows within the tribe.\u201d</p><br/><p>The ninth Tianzun narrowed his eyes when he heard Hei Qing\u2019s final sentence. He coldly laughed, \u201cIt is pointless telling me this. No one will be able to stop my Hall of Souls from doing anything. The Gu clan cannot, and your Ancient Void Dragon tribe also cannot!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ninth Tianzun\u2019s body shook after uttering these words. He transformed into a ray of light and disappeared into the horizon in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Hei Qing gently rubbed his fist as he watched the ninth Tianzun\u2019s disappearing figure. His expression was cold. A moment later, he turned his head to look at Xiao Yan. He smiled and said, \u201cLittle brother Xiao Yan, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have troubled old brother to intervene again.\u201d Xiao Yan cupped his hands as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, it doesn't matter. This time around, my Ancient Void Dragon tribe is going to have to trouble you\u2026\u201d Hei Qing shook his head. He hesitated for a moment before continuing, \u201cYou will become aware of the exact reason once you have come with me. If there is nothing else, can we leave now? This matter is of great importance. Nothing must go wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that even Hei Qing, who had a rough character, was acting with such seriousness, Xiao Yan\u2019s heart was solemn. Just what had caused the Ancient Void Dragon tribe to become this anxious?</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, however, can I bring my friend along?\u201d Xiao Yan pointed at Qing Lin a short distance away. When Hei Qing appeared, the Elder from the Profound Sky Sect, who had been entangled in a battle with Qing Lin, swiftly withdrew. He withdrew even quicker when he saw Hei Qing send Shenluo Guizun\u2019s group flying with a punch. That fellow was so frightened that he dared not approach.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s fine\u2026\u201d Hei Qing glanced at Qing Lin and nodded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan only sighed in relief after seeing a nod. It had only be a short while since the ninth Tianzun had left. He was worried about Qing Lin returning alone. It was naturally for the best that Hei Qing had agreed.</p><br/><p>While Xiao Yan sighed in relief, he waved his hand and returned the Sky Demon Puppet, which had been beaten until thousands of scars and hundreds of holes had appeared on its body. He sighed quietly within his heart. The Sky Demon Puppet, which had followed him for a long time, showed signs of becoming scrap.</p><br/><p>After Xiao Yan stored away the puppet, Qing Lin also returned her experts into her eyes, leaving a frightened Hua Jin standing in the sky. She showed her terror while she looked at Hei Qing. His might caused her to feel shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Xiao Yan, are we going to let this woman off? It\u2019s her fault we were intercepted this time around.\u201d Qing Lin softly inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan glanced at the woman and shook his head. They were pressed for time and he was too lazy to personally teach this woman a lesson.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Hei Qing, let\u2019s leave\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan turned to look at Hei Qing as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Qing nodded. His hand lifted through the air in front of him and tore a spatial crack. Xiao Yan and Qing Lin\u2019s bodies entered in a flash.</p><br/><p>Hua Jin sighed in relief when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s group leaving. She uttered a string of vicious curses in her stomach. However, those curses had just appeared in her heart when Hei Qing, whose foot had just stepped toward the spatial crack line in the sky, paused. He waved his large hand without turning his head. Waves of frightening forces tore through space and landed on Hua Jin\u2019s body in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug!\u201d</p><br/><p>An incomparably strong force caused Hua Jin to spit out a mouthful of fresh blood. Her body violently smashed into a mountain. Large rocks rolled down and buried her deep underneath.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo not think that this father will not attack you just because you are a woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hei Qing swung his large hand after sending Hua Jin flying with a slap. He flashed closer to the spatial crack. With a \u2018chi\u2019 sound, he entered it and disappeared with it.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

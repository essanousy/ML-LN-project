In this place, she was the only one who could match Queen Medusa, whose fierce reputation was feared throughout the Jia Ma Empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are looking for me?\u201d In the sky, Queen Medusa lowered her head and looked at Gu He. A delicate and narrow angle was formed as she lifted her red lips. In that instant, her exquisite appearance was complemented by a bewitching aura. Her frown and her smile caused the Dou Lings around Gu He to instantly become absent minded.</p><br/><p>Under the smiling gaze of Queen Medusa, Gu He took in a gentle breath and suppressed the emotion in his heart. He lifted his head and smiled, \u201cQueen Medusa, Your Majesty, I am honored to meet you. I am Gu He of the Jia Ma Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPill-King Gu He. I\u2019ve heard of you. A tier six alchemist is really extraordinary. You actually even managed to request the help of a Dou Huang.\u201d Queen Medusa eyes swept across the mysterious black-robed person at one side as she said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me, why are you here to look for me? Although your forceful entrance into the territory of my race is extremely rude, our Snake-People race is not a race that is unreasonable.\u201d Watching Gu He who appeared to quietly sigh in relief, a cunning glint flashed across Queen Medusa\u2019s limpid eyes. She said softly, \u201cMoreover, Pill-King Gu He\u2019s reputation as an alchemist is renowned throughout the Jia Ma Empire. When the time comes, you can randomly pledge something to repay these little losses. Am I right, Grandmaster Gu He?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d The smile on Gu He\u2019s face was a little embarrassed. However, Gu He was also someone who had a wide experience. He immediately had the magnanimity to be a sucker, proudly waved his head and smilingly said, \u201cIt is indeed rude of us to forcefully enter into the territory of your race. These losses would be compensated byme.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGe ge, Grandmaster Gu He is really open-minded.\u201d Queen Medusa touched her red lips and softly laughed. She blinked her long eyelashes and said with a soft laugh, \u201cGrandmaster, why don\u2019t you tell us the reason for you to invite so many friends and spend so much effort to arrive at the territory of our Snake-People race.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that the conversation was gradually moving into the main subject, a seriousness surfaced on Gu He\u2019s face. He was quiet for a moment as he considered his words. The laughing manner of Queen Medusa in front of him may have caused her to appear to be harmless, but he was extremely clear that this bewitching beautiful woman had turned three Dou Ling into meat pies that filled the sky when the Snake-People and the Jia Ma Empire were at war back then. Her vicious means were enough to chill those people who frequently licked the blood off their blades. Moreover, Gu He also knew that Queen Medusa\u2019s strength was among the top of those at the Dou Huang level. If not for the Jia Ma Empire having three Dou Huangs, the war might have gone differently.</p><br/><p>Even though he had the mysterious black-robed person whom he invited by his side, Gu He clearly understood that he did not invite her to fight with Queen Medusa. She was the only one who could block Queen Medusa if the latter have any killing intent and able to prevent the people around him from being killed by Queen Medusa.</p><br/><p>Gu He let out his breath slowly and raised his head. He eyed Queen Medusa in the air and said in a low voice, \u201cThe purpose of my travelling here is the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 that Your Majesty obtained!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu He\u2019s deep voice gradually reverberated through the sky, causing the originally calm surroundings to suddenly become much quieter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026 this guy has also come here because of the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019.\u201d Within the pile of rocks below, Xiao Yan gently sighed and softly said with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019? When has Her Majesty obtained something like a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019?\u201d Hearing Gu He\u2019s words, The faces of Mo Basi and Yue Mei on the city wall were stunned. Clearly, they did not know about Queen Medusa obtaining the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 from outside of Rock Desert City half a year ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor what purpose did Queen Medusa obtain the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 for?\u201d Yue Mei was at a loss as they blinked their eyes. A moment later, she appeared to have remembered something. Her expression changed drastically as she suddenly turned around and exchanged a glance with Mo Basi. She said in a soft shocked voice, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShould be. Otherwise Queen Medusa would not spend so much effort to search for the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. Besides planning to do that thing, there should not be any other intention.\u201d Mo Basi softly said after taking in a gentle breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 god. The chances of failure of that thing are extremely high! Once any accident happens to Her Majesty, then our Snake-People race\u2026\u201d Yue Mei\u2019s hands waved randomly in front of her as she said with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 Her Majesty has been at the Dou Huang level for many years. Perhaps she\u2019s feeling a little impatient. Although she usually appears to be not too concerned about these things, I know very well that she wants to become stronger. Once she becomes a Dou Zong, the strength of our Snake-People race would also swiftly increase. In the future, we would not need to be trapped in this never ending desert. We may have adapted to it over so many years but this isn\u2019t the place for us Snake-People. Our blood is cold after all.\u201d Mo Ba Si gently sighed.</p><br/><p>Yue Mei also gently sighed. She raised her head and shifted her bitterly smiling eyes toward Queen Medusa in midair whose smile on her pretty face was gradually transforming into one of indifference.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019? How did you obtain news of me obtaining a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019?\u201d Queen Medusa\u2019s delicate finger smoothed over the fallen black hair in front of her forehead. Her slightly purple-colored pretty eyes flashed with a little iciness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHalf a year ago, I was also in the desert searching for a medicinal ingredient and coincidentally sensed the presence of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. I chased after it. Although I did not discover Your Majesty\u2019s figure, I picked up a few pieces of seven-colored snake scales with blood on them\u2026 Seven-colored snake scales are strange scales that would only appear on Your Majesty\u2019s body when you use your full strength to fight. On those snake scales, I also sensed the scent of a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. I\u2019m guessing that Your Majesty was hurt by the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 when you took it away.\u201d Gu He said softly.</p><br/><p>Queen Medusa gently licked her moist red lips. Her pair of strange pupils with a faint coldness lingering in it was intently focused on Gu He.</p><br/><p>Seemingly sensing the ill intention in Queen Medusa\u2019s eyes, Gu He carefully retreated behind the black-robed person. He smiled bitterly and said, \u201cYour Majesty, I do not have any other intention. I think Your Majesty should be extremely clear of how important a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is to an alchemist. In order to obtain a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, I have visited many different strange places in the Jia Ma Empire\u2026 The blood of the Snake-People is cold. The \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 does not bring you much benefit. Therefore, I hope that Your Majesty would allow me to use other things to exchange for the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 in your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExchange?\u201d Hearing this, Queen Medusa lifted the corner of her eyes in mockery. She laughed faintly, \u201cSince you are an alchemist, you should be more clear of the strength of a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 compared to me. You tell me, what kind of things do you need to take out in order to match the value of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu He frowned slightly and mused for awhile. A rare painful expression appeared on his face. He then raised his head and said in a deep voice, \u201cI am willing to use two tier six \u2018Fighting Spirit Pills\u2019... and a tier seven \u2018Body Transformation Pill\u2019 to exchange for the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019! What does Your Majesty think?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Gu He\u2019s words escaped his mouth, the surrounding Yan Shi and the others widened their eyes and looked at Gu He with stunned faces. Even the black-robed person beside him also tilted her head over and a dumbfounded gaze shot out from under it. It was clear that even she did not expect that Gu He would be so generous because of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.</p><br/><p>A tier six \u2018Dou Ling Pill\u2019 was a medicinal pill that was sufficient to cause any Dou Wang to covet over it. The effect of this type of medicinal pill was simple but caused others to be envious. Its effect was to enable a Dou Wang level person who consumed it to raise their strength by one star!</p><br/><p>In other words, if a two star Dou Wang was to consume a \u2018Fighting Spirit Pill\u2019, they would be able to leap to a three star Dou Wang in a mere few days! It should be known that when one reaches the Dou Wang level, the gaps between each star are extremely large. Many Dou Wangs remain stagnant at the same star after training hard for a few years. From this, it can be seen just how precious a \u2018Fighting Spirit Pill\u2019 was.</p><br/><p>A \u201cFighting Spirit Pill\u201d\u2019s effect may be something that people coveted but for those that have taken it once, they gain an extremely high immunity to it. As long as a person had consumed one pill, a second \u2018Fighting Spirit Pill\u2019 had basically lost its effect. In other words, a Dou Wang can only use one \u2018Fighting Spirit Pill\u2019 in their lifetime.</p><br/><p>Even though this was so, the \u2018Fighting Spirit Pill\u2019 remained one of the most coveted medicine among the strong. Many people were willing to pay an enormous price in order to obtain a \u2018Fighting Spirit Pill\u2019!</p><br/><p>Compared to the tier six \u2018Fighting Spirit Pill\u2019, the tier seven \u2018Body Transformation Pill\u2019... was something that caused people to feel shocked.</p><br/><p>This medicinal pill was sufficient to cause countless Dou Huang level Magic Beasts to go wild over it. This was because as long as they had this medicinal pill, they would be able to entirely break away from their beast body and from then on possess the lifespan of a Magic Beast and the training talent of a human. The beast that had the superposition of these two special abilities may well have the potential to become a Dou Zhong or even a Dou Sheng level being!</p><br/><p>The two things that Gu He took out seemed to have reached the stage where some people would go crazy over. No wonder the nearby Yan Shi and the others felt a sense of disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit\u2026 this guy, isn\u2019t he too generous?\u201d From the pile of rocks, Xiao Yan was stunned as he gazed at Gu He in the sky. A long while later, he gradually recovered and mumbled in his heart, \u201cHe really lives up to being the number one person among the Jia Ma Empire\u2019s Alchemists. He even possess such a rare and valuable \u2018Body Transformation Pill\u2019. Looks like he really intends to obtain the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is indeed very generous. However, with his current alchemy level, he has an extremely low chance of successfully refining the \u2018Fighting Spirit Pill\u2019. As for that \u2018Body Transformation Pill\u2019, it would be impossible for him to refine it.\u201d Yao Lao sighed emotionally before he said with some disdain. Back then, he had personally refined the \u2018Body Transformation Pill\u2019 and naturally knew the extent of how difficult and troublesome it was to refine this kind of medicinal pill. Back then, if he did not have the help from the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, he might have found it extremely difficult to succeed in refining it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head. He lifted it to watch Yue Mei and Mo Basi. Clearly, these two people were also shocked at the price Gu He announced. Their stunned expressions were quite funny.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gaze gradually shifted to Queen Medusa in the sky. Clenching his fist tightly, he whispered, \u201cWill she agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>The people who possessed a similar thought as Xiao Yan, which included Gu He, turned their anxious gaze onto the silent Queen Medusa, waiting for her to speak.</p><br/><p>In the sky, Queen Medusa was quiet for a long time while being stared at by a countless number of gazes. She finally sighed softly, pursed up her sexy red lips and looked at Gu He with pretty eyes that carried some regret. Using a helpless voice, she said, \u201cI have to admit that your terms are extremely attractive, but\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I will not exchange with you!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Sitting at the top of the mountain, Xiao Yan calmly watched the steep mountaintops far away being shrouded in mist. There, in the mist, was the Jia Ma Empire\u2019s famous Magic Beast Mountain Range.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, power ah\u2026 In this world, without power, you\u2019re not even worth some excrement. At least, no one tries to trample on excrement.\u201d With shoulders waving up and down, the young man\u2019s soft, self-taunting voice echoed across the top of the mountain, filling the air with sadness.</p><br/><p>Yanking his hair, Xiao Yan bit down on his lip, allowing the bloody taste to spread in his mouth. Even though he didn\u2019t let his emotions get to him in the main hall, the Nalan Yanran\u2019s words stabbed at his heart like knives.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will never be insulted like this again!\u201d Opening his left hand, which still had the bloody scar from the events of the day, Xiao Yan\u2019s voice was hoarse but firm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, kid, looks like you need some help.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right when Xiao Yan pledged his oath, a wizened, strange laugh entered his ear.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face changed and he immediately turned around. With a hawk-like gaze, he scanned his surroundings but didn\u2019t even find a shadow\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, stop searching, I\u2019m on your finger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Right when Xiao Yan thought that he was hallucinating, the strange laugh aimlessly sounded again.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes contracted and his gaze fell on his right hand\u2019s black ring.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re talking?\u201d Enduring his heart\u2019s pounding, Xiao Yan tried to keep his voice calm.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, you\u2019re quite calm, to not have been scared witless.\u201d From the ring, a taunting voice sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Why are you in my ring? What are trying to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>After calming himself, Xiao Yan asked the essential questions.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho am I? You don\u2019t need to know, I won\u2019t harm you. Hahaha, after all these years, I finally found someone with a soul strong enough. What luck! Hehe, I should thank you for your offerings over the past three years, otherwise I would probably still be sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOfferings?\u201d Xiao Yan blinked his eyes in confusion. After a moment, his face darkened and chilling words jumped out of his teeth with difficulty: \u201cMy Dou Qi disappearing\u2026 you did that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I had to do that, kid don\u2019t be mad at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou F*CKER!\u201d</p><br/><p>The normally calm and composed Xiao Yan became enraged like a lunatic. His small face was filled with savagery, and without caring that the ring was the only memento of his mother, he ripped the ring off of his finger and flung it over the cliff with all of his might.</p><br/><p>As the ring left his hand, Xiao Yan\u2019s mind finally cleared. Hurriedly he tried to catch the flying ring but the ring had already passed cliff, freefalling down the mountain\u2026</p><br/><p>Staring at the ring disappearing into the mist, Xiao Yan was stunned for a long time. Finally, his face lost its savagery and calmed. He smacked his forehead, upset: \u201cIdiot that was too reckless, too reckless!\u201d</p><br/><p>To realize that the culprit of his humiliation for the past three years was the ring he always wore, it was unsurprising that Xiao Yan reacted so violently.</p><br/><p>After sitting at the edge of the cliff for a long time, Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. Standing up, he prepared to go back but his eyes widened and his finger shakily pointed at the thing in front of him.</p><br/><p>In front of Xiao Yan was the pitch-black ring, floating in the sky. But the thing that surprised Xiao Yan the most was the transparent wizened figure above the ring\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, kid, you don\u2019t need to be so mad do you? I only took three years of your Dou Qi.\u201d The transparent elder smiled at the stunned Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth twitched and he pushing down his anger. He said: \u201cGeezer, since you were hiding within the ring, then you should know how much pain you\u2019ve caused me since you took my Dou Qi right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut with these three years of humiliations, you\u2019ve matured right? Do you think that three years ago you would have had this kind of tolerance and mindset?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan furrowed his brows but his emotions started to calm down. After the rage, a hint of happiness took over Xiao Yan. Since he knew why his Dou Qi was disappearing, his talent had returned!</p><br/><p>Thinking about the chance to take off the title of crippled that countless others had put on him, Xiao Yan felt as if he had been reborn. The detestable elder in front him didn\u2019t look as annoying as before.</p><br/><p>Some things, after they disappear, would make one start appreciating their value! After losing and regaining it, one treasures it more!</p><br/><p>Lightly twisting his wrist, Xiao Yan let out a long breath and said: \u201cEven though I don\u2019t know who you are, I would like to know if you plan on staying in the ring to steal my Dou Qi. If that\u2019s the case then I would ask for you to find a new owner, I can\u2019t afford to keep on raising you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, other people don\u2019t have as strong of Soul Perception as you.\u201d The elder stroked his beard: \u201cSince I already chose to appear, then before you give me permission I won\u2019t take your Dou Qi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan rolled his eyes and sneered without saying anything. He had already decided, regardless of anything the elder says, he would not keep that ring by his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, do you want to become strong? Do you want to be respected by other?\u201d Even though Xiao Yan had already decided to not have anything more to do with the elder, his heart started beating rapidly when he heard those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI already know why my Dou Qi was disappearing and with my talent, why do I need you to become strong?\u201d Letting out a small breath, Xiao Yan smoothly said. He knew that there were no free lunches in this world. To owe a mysterious person a favor, isn\u2019t a smart move.</p><br/><p>\u201cKid, even though your talent is pretty good, you should know that you\u2019re already 15 but your Dou Qi is only at 3 Duan. I think that I heard that your adult ceremony is next year right? Do you think that within a year, using your talent and hard work you can get to 7 Duan Qi? In addition, the girl who you promised to fight three years from now doesn\u2019t have shabby talent either. You want to catch up and surpass her? It\u2019s not going to be easy.\u201d The elder\u2019s face that was full of wrinkles blossomed like a Chrysanthemum.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you didn\u2019t take my Dou Qi, then do you think that any of this would have happened? You old f*cker!\u201d After his biggest weakness was exposed, Xiao Yan\u2019s face darkened once again and he started to curse.</p><br/><p>After cursing, Xiao Yan felt a hint of despair. In his current situation, no matter how much he cursed, there would be no effect. The practice of Dou Qi required a strong foundation. Back when he was four, it took him 6 years to get to 9 Duan Dou Qi. Even with his talent, getting to 7 Duan Qi in just one year was hopeless.</p><br/><p>Sighing depressedly, Xiao Yan glanced at the pretentious elder. The edge of his mouth curled and he asked: \u201cDo you have a solution?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe.\u201d The elder vaguely replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you help me to get to 7 Duan Qi in just one year then I\u2019ll forgive you for taking my Dou Qi for three years. How\u2019s that?\u201d Xiao Yan probingly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, wishful thinking kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you can\u2019t help me then why should I keep you, someone useless, by my side? You should find another unfortunate person\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan knew that the transparent elder couldn\u2019t randomly take Dou Qi from other people so he knew that he had some leverage in the negotiations.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even remotely close to a 15 year old young man. Looks like these three years really helped you grow a lot. Did my plan backfire?\u201d Looking at the clever Xiao Yan, the elder paused and then dumbfoundedly shook his head.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders and lightly said: \u201cIf you want me to keep you by my side then you should at least have some sincerity right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a sharp mouthed kid. Alright, alright, after all, I do need your help.\u201d Without another choice, the elder nodded and slowly came to the ground. After examining Xiao Yan for a while, a treacherous smile spread across his face. But as soon as it appeared, it left and the elder pondered for a moment before unwilling asking: \u201cDo you want to become an alchemist?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

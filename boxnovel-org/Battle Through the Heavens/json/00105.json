A moment later, they stood up with their faces full of happiness. After exchanging a glance with each other, they immediately hurried out of the hall towards the clan\u2019s front door and invited the group of pretty girls into the clan.</p><br/><p>Under Xiao Yan\u2019s introduction, the two parties began to get to know one another. Once Xiao Zhan found out that Instructor Ruo Lin and group had the intention of staying over, he agreed without any hesitation and immediately ordered people to prepare the empty rooms in the backyard. His decisive move left a favorable impression on Instructor Ruo Lin and her students.</p><br/><p>With the addition of a group of beautiful and gifted students from Jia Nan Academy, the atmosphere of the clan became much more lively. Many young male clan members congregated around, their eyes continuously sweeping over the group of beautiful girls. At the same time, they threw envious glances at Xiao Yan who was surrounded by the girls who were unceasingly questioning him.</p><br/><p>Nightfall slowly descended upon them and as the host, the Xiao Clan provided the best lodging. After dinner, Xiao Yan found an excuse to quietly return to his room after seeing that both parties were having quite a few friendly conversations. He laid his tired body on the soft bed. The battle with Instructor Ruo Lin today, in spite of Yao Lao\u2019s help towards the end, had exhausted him\u2026</p><br/><p>The morning sunlight came shining through the window, lighting up the entire room. On his bed, the young man, with a pair of hazy eyes, sat up. After staring blankly for a moment, Xiao Yan finally got down from his bed as he yawned and washed his face in a simple manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Lao. When are we leaving?\u201d After drying his face, Xiao Yan randomly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go out to prepare some things later. Freshwater, food, a tent, insect repellant, low-grade medicinal ingredients, healing medicine and medicine to recover one\u2019s energy are all essential things needed for your training. After all, we may be spending a long period of time living deep in the mountains.\u201d The transparent Yao Lao appeared next to the table and lightly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, I look forward to it.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled as he quickly pulled clothes over his body.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s eager manner, Yao Lao raised his eyebrows and said softly, \u201cSince you were born, you have not experienced any life and death battles. A person\u2019s potential can only burst out when his life is threatened. With the kind of tepid training that you do, you will never be able to become someone truly strong. You do not lack talent, what you lack is the experience of real battles.\u201d Carelessly playing with the tea cup in his hand, Yao Lao glanced at Xiao Yan, whose speed of putting on his clothes had slowed and casually said, \u201cOnly after experiencing bloodshed will you truly undergo a change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly tightened his fist as he raised his face and smiled at Yao Lao. \u201cI believe I will be able to overcome it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to have confidence.\u201d Yao Lao, who was extremely satisfied with Xiao Yan\u2019s confidence, smiled and nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha. But, teacher...The Di class Dou Technique that you mentioned the last time\u2026 when are you going to teach me?\u201d Xiao Yan laughed as he stepped forward and asked. He had been looking forward to the Di class Dou Technique for a long time.</p><br/><p>TL: Huang &lt; Xuan &lt; Di &lt; Tian</p><br/><p>Glancing at the smiling Xiao Yan, a teasing expression appeared on Yao Lao\u2019s face, \u201cRelax. Since I have said that I will teach you, I will not go back on my words. Wait until we leave Wu Tan City, hehe\u2026 be prepared to slowly learn from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching Yao Lao\u2019s manner, Xiao Yan\u2019s heart suddenly felt uneasy. He let out two bursts of dry laughter but did not continue the meaningless conversation. After putting everything into his breast pocket, he opened the door and left.</p><br/><p>At that time, Instructor Ruo Lin and the others had once more rushed to the plaza from yesterday and began recruitment. The clan\u2019s home had once again become much emptier.</p><br/><p>After taking a few small turns, Xiao Yan swaggered out of the front door of his clan\u2019s home. Watching the scene outside, he suddenly became stunned.</p><br/><p>The wide road outside the front entrance was already packed with carriages. On these gorgeously adorned carriages, there were many crests. From these crest, Xiao Yan could recognise that most of belonged to fairly strong forces in Wu Tan City.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk. They have heard of the news pretty quickly\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head and sighed in surprised. Once again, Xiao Yan appreciated the enormous influence of the Jia Nan Academy student recruitment party in Wu Tan City.</p><br/><p>After letting his gaze drift randomly, Xiao Yan finally retrieved it. He ignored these people as he widened his footsteps and walked straight ahead.</p><br/><p>Walking along the road that had become lively because of Jia Nan Academy\u2019s student recruitment, Xiao Yan slowly strolled towards the auction house in the middle of the city. As he was about to approach his destination, he patiently pulled the large black cloak over him just as he did many times before. Only then did he reassuringly walk into the auction house, which was even more crowded than usual.</p><br/><p>Ya Fei elegantly sat on a chair with her right leg crossed over her left, revealing an attractive whiteness below her long dress.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Ya Fei was holding a long scroll of paper in her hand. It took her a long while before she finally finished going through the list of ingredients. A surprised expression appeared on her enchanting face. Raising her head, she eyed the black cloaked man beside her and asked in a surprised voice, \u201cXiao Yan di-di, why did you list so many things that are needed to survive outdoors? Don\u2019t tell me you are planning to go on a journey?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHum. I will be leaving Wu Tan City in the next few days. Perhaps\u2026 it may be a year or two before I return.\u201d Xiao Yan said as he lightly sipped his tea.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne or two years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ya Fei was stunned after hearing those words as she asked, \u201cWhy do you need so long? What do you intend to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha I\u2019m already an adult so I wish to go out and gain some experience. I do not wish to be bottled up in this small Wu Tan City\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, with your talent, staying in Wu Tan City may hinder your ability to become really strong.\u201d Ya Fei said softly as she inclined her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat mysterious Alchemist will also be leaving with you, won\u2019t he?\u201d Ya Fei asked after a brief silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, he\u2019s my teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder...\u201d Ya Fei suddenly nodded her head and stared deeply at Xiao Yan. She speculated, \u201cThen\u2026 you can also be considered an Alchemist, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe healing medicine of the Xiao Clan was refined by me.\u201d Xiao Yan replied with a smile and didn\u2019t hold anything back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe. Uncle Gu Ni managed to find some clues from the level of refinement of the \u2018Blood Clotting Powder\u2019. The only reason why he hasn\u2019t guessed that it was you is because he does not know the relationship between you and the alchemist.\u201d Ya Fei simply nodded calmly at Xiao Yan\u2019s words, without displaying much surprise. It was obvious that she had already guessed some of the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease help me prepare all the items and deduct the costs from my card. Don\u2019t reject me. I do not want to owe any favors before I leave.\u201d Xiao Yan took out a pale golden card from his breast pocket and handed it to Ya Fei. The card contained over four hundred thousand gold coins which was his share of the profits from the Xiao Clan\u2019s sale of healing medicine.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling somewhat helpless, Ya Fei nodded and received the card. She waved for a female servant and handed both the card and the paper scroll over, ordering the servant to quickly see to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter I leave, I hope that the Primer Auction House would take care of the Xiao Clan. In the future, if Ya Fei Jie has anything that she needs help with, I will definitely not put it off.\u201d Xiao Yan said smiled as he raised his head and looked at the glamorous woman in front of him who could be called a stunner.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, since you have already addressed me as Ya Fei jie, how could I reject you? Anyway, I would do anything to try to get into the good graces of an alchemist with limitless potential, even if it costs me my life.\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s manner of addressing her, which was filled with significantly more sincerity, caused Ya Fei\u2019s beautiful long narrow eyes to curl into an attractive angle. Her hand held her fragrant cheeks as she stared at the corner of the young man\u2019s face unhidden by the black cloak while she blinked her eyes in a wavering manner. A faint enchanting allure surfaced on her bewitchingly mature face.</p><br/><p>A numbing sound that was filled with temptation caused Xiao Yan\u2019s heart to tremor. Immediately, he shook his head. This woman was a natural stunner that was designed to seduce men. Had this been a private place void of people and had he been another man with weaker control, he would have been overwhelmed by lust and forcefully have her on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I will stop teasing you.\u201d The slightly hurried breath under the black cloak caused Ya Fei\u2019s moist red lips to curl into a triumphant smile. She loved causing this overtly calm young man to reveal a shyness that someone of his age ought to have in front of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan di-di, I look forward to seeing what kind strength you will achieved when you once again return to Wu Tan City.\u201d Ya Fei said softly as her charming smile faded from her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also looking forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>With a smile, Xiao Yan raised his head and eyed the female servant hurrying towards him from beyond the curtain. He gradually sat up, waved his hand and said, \u201cI\u2019m leaving. This is likely the last time that I will be here before I leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gracefully standing up, Ya Fei prettily stood in front of Xiao Yan as she watched this young man whom she had gotten along with for the last one to two years. Although most of their relationship was calculated by business, Ya Fei had another kind of love for this slightly younger indifferent looking young man. This love was not that of a man and a woman. Instead, it was somewhat like the feeling between a brother and sister.</p><br/><p>Reaching out her hand, Ya Fei patted Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders. A slight sadness appeared in her vivid eyes. \u201cTake care.\u201d</p><br/><p>Raising his eyes, Xiao Yan fixed his eyes on this famous beauty that few in Wu Tan City did not know of. He suddenly smiled, stepped forward and reached out his hand and lightly grabbed Ya Fei\u2019s snake like curvy waist that was filled with temptation.</p><br/><p>As Xiao Yan\u2019s hand hugged this perfect waist that an uncountable number of men in Wu Tan City had drooled over, he could feel that her body had stiffened. Only a long while later did it start to return to its original softness.</p><br/><p>Ya Fei froze on the spot. Being bid farewell by Xiao Yan in such a special manner had caused her face to turn slightly red. However, she was lucky that Xiao Yan did not make the next move, otherwise, she would have really thought that the lust of this little boy had swelled.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care, Ya Fei jie. I know that your identity is not merely that of a chief auctioneer but I would like to seriously tell you something.\u201d Placing his chin on Ya Fei shoulders, Xiao Yan deeply sniffed her faint body scent. The corner of his mouth rose teasingly, \u201cIn the future, you should never allow another man to hug you in this manner. Because other than me, other men would be thinking of how to take you to bed when they hug you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Ya Fei was startled. Immediately, an attractive blush covered her face as she scolded, \u201cLittle boy, how dare you mock me? I think that you are the one who thinks like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d Heartily letting out two laughs, Xiao Yan ceased clinging on the softness in his hands and withdrew his hands without the slightest reluctance. After waving at Ya Fei, he turned and headed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoodbye, Ya Fei jie. See you in a year\u2019s time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Softly laughing, Xiao Yan walked to the door where the female servant, who was totally shocked at witnessing Xiao Yan\u2019s intimate acts with Ya Fei, stood. Smiling, he picked up his golden card and two small storage rings from the silver plate. After saying his thanks, he walked out of the auction house without a backward glance.</p><br/><p>Only after seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s back gradually disappearing around a corner did the redness on Ya Fei\u2019s face gradually disappear. She stroked the spot on her waist which Xiao Yan had held, feeling a faint lingering warmness, an unusual feeling that caused the strength in Ya Fei\u2019s legs to falter.</p><br/><p>\u201cA boy that\u2019s allots his desires. But, I really anticipate the day of your return. I really don\u2019t want to lose such a good business partner. Also...I am really curious to see just how high you will have gotten when you return.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

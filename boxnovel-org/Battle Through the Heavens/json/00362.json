At that spot, two human figures were suspended in the air. Thick killing intent was overflowing from within the body of the black-robed young man who was in charge.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan? Why has he returned?\u201d When some of the sharp eyed people saw the cold face of the black-robed young man, numerous shocked noises immediately and repeatedly sounded from within the Misty Cloud Sect. This young man who had turned the Misty Cloud Sect upside down days before had caused every single Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s disciple to firmly remember this name.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s dark and cold gaze slowly swept all over of the Misty Cloud Sect below. Finally, it paused on a large hall. At that spot, a white glow which contained a fury suddenly shot out explosively. Finally, it suspended in the sky and a furious roar resounded throughout the sky, \u201cXiao Yan, you are actually this rude. Are you seeking death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes stared intently at the green-faced Yun Leng who was suspended in midair. His right hand abruptly drew the Heavy Xuan Ruler from his back and suddenly pointed at the latter. In a thick voice, he said, \u201cOld bastard. Even if Yun Shan wants to protect you today, I will still take your life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, what an arrogant tone! Coincidentally, I am looking for you too. Today, I think you should stay at the Misty Cloud Sect.\u201d Yun Leng coldly laughed. He clenched his teeth and angrily replied. Having his name directly threatened and cursed by this person who had charged into their sect really caused him to lose all his reputation within the sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Leng, shut up!\u201d A clear cold cry suddenly sounded in the sky. When they heard this cry, the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s disciples below bowed their bodies slightly and unanimously. Even Yun Leng could only violently shake his hand and take a step back.</p><br/><p>A few white lights flashed across the horizon. Immediately, a few human figures scattered and appeared in the sky. The person in the middle was wearing a moon-white robe. The corner of her skirt fluttered gently in the wind. The hair on her head was set in a phoenix shape, setting off that pretty face. Her nobility contained some dignity that was difficult to hide.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze slowly swept across the few people who had appeared. His gaze stopped on Yun Shan for a moment before turning toward the moon-robed woman, who was at the center. For her to be able to willfully scold Yun Leng, who was the First Elder, it was likely that her status was quite high. Within the Misty Cloud Sect, other than Yun Shan who was present, it was likely that only the current Sect Leader, Yun Yun, possessed such authority.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze moved upward. It finally stopped on that graceful and noble pretty face. The two gazes interacted and were momentarily at a loss. Immediately, they became suddenly dull.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a gentle breeze blew past and two dull faces which were looking at each other appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Zhi?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the quiet midair, two shocked voices which carried a perplexity were suddenly emitted from the mouths of both Xiao Yan and the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s Sect Leader, Yun Yun.</p><br/><p>After the words left their mouths, the both of them were startled. Their gazes took one look around them. They seemed to have sensed something and their expressions immediately underwent some changes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Zhi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze stared intently at the beautiful face, which had actually appeared a little flustered. A long while later, Xiao Yan appeared to have thought of something. He abruptly inhaled a deep cold breath. For some unknown reason, his heart had quietly become colder. His voice was trembling a little in anger, \u201cI\u2019m afraid that it would be more appropriate to call you the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s Sect Leader, Yun Yun, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Those pupils which were filled with dignity within the large hall earlier were now a little flustered and uncertain. Yun Yun laughed, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that the Xiao Yan whom Yanran had mentioned was actually you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYun-er, are you acquainted with Xiao Yan?\u201d Hearing the somewhat mindless conversation between the two, Yun Leng and the others around them were stunned. They faced each other. Beside them, Yun Shan furrowed his brows and could not resist interrupting.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we have met a couple of times. However, he had also hidden his true name, therefore\u2026\u201d Yun Yun appeared to be a little evasive as she softly replied.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart slowly became disappointed upon hearing Yun Yun\u2019s words. He mocked himself and shook his head. He then lifted it and said with a smile, \u201cYun Yun da-ren is the Sect Leader of the Misty Cloud Sect. I am but a nameless little fellow, how can we be acquainted? The person whom I knew was called Yun Zhi and not Yun Yun.\u201d</p><br/><p>TL: da-ren : used to refer to someone respectfully/ an official of higher ranking</p><br/><p>The back of Yun Yun\u2019s teeth bit her red lips. She stared at the young face which contained self ridicule. Those words of his caused Yun Yun to faintly have a pained feeling within her heart. Her hands within her sleeves had also tightened. The degree of strength used actually caused her fingers bone to become whiter.</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s gaze swept back and forth between Xiao Yan and Yun Yun. The frown on his forehead became deeper. He could sense that something had definitely happened between the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, I let you leave the last time. Why have you come to my Misty Cloud Sect this time. Moreover, you have humiliated our sect\u2019s Elder in front of everyone. Do you really think that our Misty Cloud Sect is easy to bully? Although you have Queen Medusa supporting you, the old me would like to advise you to not go overboard in anything that you do. If you want to find soft persimmon to knead, you have come to the wrong place!\u201d Yun Shan glanced at Queen Medusa behind Xiao Yan and shouted in a deep voice. There was a faint anger within his cry.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze indifferently shifted from Yun Yun toward Yun Shan. He coldly laughed, \u201cSect Leader Yun Shan, I\u2019m afraid that you will have to ask First Elder Yun Leng for the reason that I have come to the Misty Cloud Sect, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s expression changed slightly. He violently cut Yun Leng with his eyes before saying in a deep voice, \u201cThis time around, Yun Leng\u2019s actions were merely a little impulsive. Moreover, he did not create much damage to your Xiao clan. I will send someone from the Misty Cloud Sect to compensate your clan for what has been damaged. Alright, if you have come because of that matter, you can leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha,\u201d Xiao Yan was startled when he heard Yun Shan\u2019s words. He immediately and abruptly let out a laughter. There was a little savage killing intent within his laughter. In the next moment, Xiao Yan, who had lowered his head and let out a loud laughter, abruptly raised it. That delicate and handsome face was contorted with killing intent. \u201cYun Shan, I am only speaking to you this politely because I respect you as a senior. However, are you really ignorant or are you pretending to be ignorant? Do you really think that the old dog Yun Leng came to my Xiao clan merely to damage some buildings? Due to what he did this time, my entire Xiao clan was nearly exterminated. How can this consequence be completely offset by a casual mention or compensation by you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of the few people in the sky changed slightly when they heard this. Yun Shan\u2019s and Yun Yun\u2019s expressions became a lot uglier. They did not expect that Yun Leng and the others had hidden so many things from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is true that Yun Leng was a little overboard with regards to this matter. What compensation do you want? My Misty Cloud Sect will try our best to agree to them.\u201d Yun Shan sternly said. This time around, his tone was a little softer perhaps because his side was in the wrong.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompensation. All you know is compensation!\u201d His reply sounded like thunder as a roar exploded forth and his face took on a ferocious expression.</p><br/><p>TL: All you know is compensation = you don\u2019t know anything else/ it\u2019s not the right solution</p><br/><p>Hearing this insult which was extremely blunt, all the Misty Cloud Sect members, including Yun Shan himself felt their heads become a little giddy. Given his status, when had he ever received such abuse? After feeling a little giddy, fury surged. Yun Shan\u2019s expression had also become dark and solemn.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat old dog Yun Leng had chased after my father from the Xiao clan, planning to kill him. Even now, he has not returned, and we don\u2019t know whether he is alive or not. If you don\u2019t give me an explanation today, I will decimate the Misty Cloud Sect even if I have to gamble this life of mine!\u201d Originally, Xiao Zhan\u2019s disappearance had already caused Xiao Yan\u2019s heart to be filled with killing intent and fury. Now that he had suddenly discovered Yun Zhi\u2019s true identity, his heart became a little more fretful. Adding all this to was the total nonsense that Yun Shan had spoken, Xiao Yan\u2019s heart, which already harbored killing intent combined with a ferociousness surging within it, finally erupted like a volcano.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour father? Yun Leng never said that he hurt your father.\u201d Yun Yun could not resist saying as she eyed Xiao Yan who was becoming increasingly wild.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen do you mean that the truth which was witnessed by a few hundred members of the Xiao Clan was fabricated? In order to divert Yun Leng, those three old dogs, my father fled Wu Tan City by himself. Yun Leng and the two others gave chase. After this, my father never returned. If I don\u2019t find the Misty Cloud Sect to settle this account, who would I find? Who? Tell me!\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s expression was ferocious as he roared at Yun Yun.</p><br/><p>In so many years, this was the first time that she had been angrily roared at by some. Logically speaking, Yun Yun would have immediately become furious. For some unknown reason, however, she could not be even the slightest bit angry when faced with this person in front of her. She bit her red lips with the back of her teeth and turned her gaze toward Yun Leng. She angrily said, \u201cYun Leng, give me a clear explanation of this matter. Otherwise, I have the authority to get you to temporarily hand over the First Elder position!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Leader, I did not harm his father.\u201d Some cold perspiration dripped from Yun Leng\u2019s head as he hurriedly said, \u201cBack then, we did indeed gave chase. However, when we were about to capture him at a certain dense forest, he had suddenly disappeared. After that, even though we searched the nearby region, we still did not find any trace of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSuddenly disappeared?\u201d Yun Yun knit her eyebrows slightly, clenched her teeth and scolded, \u201cXiao Zhan\u2019s strength is merely that of the Da Dou Shi class. How can he disappear in front of you all with, one Dou Wang and two Dou Lings? If you want to lie, you should find a better excuse!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also ignorant about this. But the truth is as such. If Sect Leader does not believe me, you can go and ask Yun Lei and the other. They also witnessed it with their own eyes. I can swear that I have not lied with regards to this matter.\u201d Yun Leng smiled bitterly and said.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun and Yun Shan exchanged glances. They frowned intently. Even if they were to believe Yun Leng\u2019s words, Xiao Yan would definitely not be willing to let things go like this. The two of them lifted their heads and indeed saw Xiao Yan\u2019s expression gradually becoming completely dark and solemn.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze stared at Yun Leng in a dark and cold manner. The fury which had exploded within his heart caused him to no longer listen to any of the nonsense of the other party. He inhaled a deep breath of cool air and flipped both his hands. The huge Heavy Xuan Ruler disappeared from his palm. His right hand was gently extended out and a green colored flame curled upward in front of everyone's gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t hand over the person today, I will destroy this place.\u201d Xiao Yan stared at the green colored flame. The dark, black pupils of his reflected a ferocious green glow. The voice which was like him muttering to himself, contained a killing intent, causing the expression of everyone present to change slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, give me a few days. I will send people to help you search. If it is really as Yun Leng has said, your father\u2019s life should not be in any danger.\u201d Yun Yun hurriedly replied upon seeing that Xiao Yan had gone uncontrollably wild.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need. I don\u2019t trust the people from the Misty Cloud Sect anymore.\u201d Xiao Yan gently shook his head. He lowered it and eyed the green colored flame seedling that was gently fluttering on his hand. \u201cToday, I want the life of that old dog, Yun Leng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, Yun Leng is indeed in the wrong with regards to this matter. However, isn\u2019t it a little overboard for you to take his life just because of this?\u201d Yun Shan said in a deep voice, \u201cMoreover, even if you have the help of Queen Medusa, it is a little impossible to use your own strength to kill Yun Leng, no? I will not make a fuss of this matter today. Leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan eyed Yun Shan who had waved his hand and a ridicule spilled from the corner of his mouth. His left hand was slowly raised. With a shake of his hand, a thick white flame suddenly appeared in everyone's sight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019?\u201d The eyes of everyone present shrunk abruptly when they saw the custer of thick white flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Shan, this is something that you have forced me to do.\u201d Xiao Yan eyed the two different colored flames on his hand and softly muttered.</p><br/><p>His hands paused for a moment. Immediately, they began to slowly move toward each other in front of everyone's eyes.</p><br/><p>Outside the Misty Cloud Sect, a few flowing lights suddenly came flashing over. They immediately stopped on a huge tree. When their gaze swept toward the two kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 on Xiao Yan\u2019s hands which were slowly being brought together, they could not resist inhaling a breath of cool air.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens. This fellow is really crazy. Does he plan on completely destroying the Misty Cloud Sect? How did those idiots of the Misty Cloud Sect provoke him to this point?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hai Bodong\u2019s figure appeared on the top of a tree. He was stunned as he watched the green and white flame moving closer to one another. His voice was nearly dull as he mumbled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

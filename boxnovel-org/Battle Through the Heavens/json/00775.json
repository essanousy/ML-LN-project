His appearance was quite fierce, and his hand had an enormous black python tattoo. When his hand moved, the enormous python appeared as though it was a living creature that emitted threads of violent, dark aura.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the latter was using a pair of fierce eyes to look at Xiao Yan. Powerful Dou Qi repeatedly writhed over the surface of his body. The hard rock surface where he had landed had cracked open. Clearly, this was due to the force of the earlier confrontation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s observed this fierce male Snake-Person. He could sense that the latter was an expert at the peak of the Dou Wang class. However, he was not considered to be an opponent that was troublesome to deal with in Xiao Yan\u2019s opinion. Nevertheless, Xiao Yan felt some anger at the other party\u2019s sudden sneak attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander Mo Ba Si of the Snake-People Tribe!\u201d The male Snake-Person\u2019s eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan. The enmity within his eyes was exceptionally obvious, \u201cYou are that Xiao Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan indifferently nodded. A fierce glow immediately flashed across the eyes of that Mo Ba Si when he saw Xiao Yan nod. His fist was suddenly clenched and the strong muscles on his arm wiggled, causing the enormous black python tattoo to appear alive. It seemed like it was unleashing an evil aura that rushed to the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will no longer hold back if you come again.\u201d Some hatred also appeared in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes when he saw this stubborn fellow. A jade-green flame rose on his hand as he slowly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, this commander shall ask for advice!\u201d Mo Ba Si furiously cried out. However, his body was just about to pounce over when a cold voice was transmitted over. It caused his entire body to stiffened.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnough, enough. This Queen orders you to stop!\u201d</p><br/><p>Medusa turned her head and spoke to Mo Ba Si with vertical eyebrows. She reprimanded, \u201cMo Ba Si, your manners are worsening. He is a guest of our Snake-People Tribe. How can you just randomly launch a sneak attack?\u201d</p><br/><p>The strongly built Mo Ba Si did not reveal the slightest impatience upon being reprimanded by Medusa. He helplessly nodded. However, the gaze he was using to look at Medusa with was filled with dense adoration and respect.</p><br/><p>Mo Ba Si threw another dark, solemn gaze toward Xiao Yan before unwillingly withdrawing to one side.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan finally scattered the jade-green flame on his fist after watching that fellow withdraw. Perhaps it was possible to tell the reason for the other person\u2019s displeasure toward him from the way that fellow was looking at Medusa. However, this did not cause Xiao Yan to feel any concern. His gaze swept over this compound only to knit his brows slightly. This compound that was quite big had quite a number of Snake-People figures. From the looks of the aura of these people, they were clearly the top experts of the Snake-People Tribe. Yue Mei, whom he had rescued, was also among them.</p><br/><p>These experts from the Snake-People race were looking at Xiao Yan with eyes that were filled with some curiosity. Clearly, his act of forcing back Mo Ba Si with a punch had attracted the interest of quite a number of people. The thing that caused them to feel most surprised about was Medusa\u2019s attitude toward Xiao Yan. Although her face did not reveal too much gentleness, her tone was protective of him. This was indeed an extremely incredulous thing when remembering Medusa\u2019s extreme hatred of humans.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d Medusa softly spoke to Xiao Yan who was standing at the entrance. After which, she took the lead in walking to the deeper areas of the compound. Behind her, Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment, but could only follow as the many surrounding gazes that were looking at him filled with ill intent.</p><br/><p>The compound finally became much more lively after Medusa and Xiao Yan entered the inner compound. Everyone became talkative as they began to discuss what happened.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan followed Medusa as they walked down a couple of serenely quiet paths. A while later, the two of them stopped in front of a bamboo building that was hidden in a bamboo forest deep in the compound.</p><br/><p>Medusa paused in front of the bamboo house and a solemness appeared on her face. After which, she lightly knocked on the door.</p><br/><p>\u201cEnter.\u201d</p><br/><p>An elderly voice was transmitted from the bamboo room after the door had vibrated.</p><br/><p>The door opened with the voice. Medusa glanced at Xiao Yan before she turned around and entered the building.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stood at the entrance and hesitated for a moment. He could faintly sense that there were four obscure auras within the bamboo room. Although they were not as strong as Medusa, they could not be underestimated. After all, these four auras were slightly stronger when compared with Jia Xing Tian and Hai Bodong. Of course, these four people had yet to breakthrough to the Dou Zong class. They were merely at the peak of the Dou Huang class.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief within his heart after he sensed the strength of these four auras. As long as they were not elite Dou Zongs, he would not need to be afraid. With his ability, there should not be many people in the Dou Huang class who would be able to retain him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s body moved after his heart calmed down. He also slowly walked in. When he did so, the door of the bamboo house automatically shut.</p><br/><p>A faint light suddenly rose after Xiao Yan entered the bamboo house. Four old figures immediately appeared in Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze within that spacious room. Medusa was quietly sitting on a futon by the side.</p><br/><p>An old figure within the house opened her eyes after she seemed to have sensed Xiao Yan\u2019s footsteps. Triangular shaped eyes were locked onto Xiao Yan like how a poisonous snake would study its prey, causing a chill to rise on his skin.</p><br/><p>The remaining three old women also suddenly opened their eyes after she did so. Four dark, cold auras rose before finally gathering together. Their auras actually agglomerated into an enormous black python above them. The enormous python\u2019s emotionless eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan and an invisible pressure quietly rose. Finally, it turned into a thousand kilogram force that clustered around Xiao Yan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression became increasingly more solemn as he sensed the pressure of that powerful aura. He suddenly let out a soft cry. A jade-green flame suddenly rose and immediately wrapped around his entire body.</p><br/><p>The temperature within the room suddenly rose the moment the jade-green flame appeared. That dark coldness that was created by the four old women immediately and completely disappeared. That enormous dark-black python seemed to have been affected as it became much more illusionary.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019... it is actually a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of the center old woman in the room displayed surprise as she observed the jade-green flame that lingered over Xiao Yan\u2019s body. The enormous python aura above her head gradually began to disappear as she slowly said, \u201cYou are the chief of the Yan Alliance, Xiao Yan?\u201d Her voice was awful, appearing as though a rock was scratching glass. It caused an uncomfortable feeling to spread over a person\u2019s entire body.</p><br/><p>Of course, given Xiao Yan\u2019s strength, he was naturally able to filter out this kind of feeling. He bowed to the four old women courteously before saying, \u201cXiao Yan from the younger generation greets four senior Snake-People Tribe Elders.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow unexpected\u2026 you are able to reach the Dou Huang class at such a young age. You are indeed someone blessed with great talent.\u201d That center old woman revealed an ugly smile toward Xiao Yan. She quickly said,\u201dThis old woman is the First Elder of the Snake-People Tribe. This is the Second Elder, the Third Elder, and the Fourth Elder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes followed the movement of the shriveled finger of the First Elder. He courteously greeted every single one of them. No matter how one put it, he should at least follow etiquette properly.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I have called chief Xiao over partly because there is something that I wish to inquire.\u201d The First Elder\u2019s triangular-shaped eyes moved after completing the introductions. Her voice was hoarse and awful when she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder, please speak.\u201d Xiao Yan dryly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis matter is related to our tribe leader Medusa.\u201d The First Elder\u2019s voice was without ripple, appearing much like an old well. There was not much change in her tone. However, it was because of this that Xiao Yan did not dare to slight her even a little within his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cOur clan\u2019s leaders are all virgins before they are able to transform into a human form. Of course, Medusa has currently transformed into a human form. However, she must undergo the baptism at the altar within the tribe before she can have any intercourse with anyone. However, when the clan leader had returned this time, she was no longer a virgin. I have heard that this is related to chief Xiao?\u201d The voice of the First Elder had suddenly become stern at the end. Four pairs of cold, grim eyes were shot over, locking onto Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed a little. His feet took a step back without leaving any traces. He immediately laughed in a bitter manner, \u201cFour Elders, this was not Xiao Yan\u2019s intention. The matter is quite complicated\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, chief Xiao has admitted to taking Medusa\u2019s virginity?\u201d The First Elder questioned in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was silent. He immediately helplessly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to our tribe rules, chief Xiao must suffer the punishment of being bitten by over ten thousand snakes\u2026\u201d The second Elder who was seated beside the First Elder suddenly spoke with a dark murky tone.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed a little. Dou Qi slowly began to flow in his body as he said with a deep voice, \u201cFour Elders. Although this is not something that Xiao Yan was willing to do, I do indeed have some responsibility. However, your tribe rules seem to be unable to manage me, no? If you really want to use force, Xiao Yan will not simply just allow himself to be captured!\u201d</p><br/><p>Medusa\u2019s eyebrows were slightly knit when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s somewhat solemn face. She did not wish to see the relationship between Xiao Yan and the First Elder become this stiff. Moreover, the four Elders had said that they would not make things difficult for Xiao Yan. Why...</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, what a tough set of bones\u2026\u201d The First Elder glanced at Xiao Yan before raising her eyebrows. She waved her hand and said, \u201cForget it, we shall not scare you little fellow. Now that the Snake-People Tribe and the Jia Ma Empire are in an alliance, our Snake-People Tribe must require your care as the chief of the Yan Alliance. I will naturally not let you suffer the whatever ten thousand snake bites punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan felt joy in his heart when he heard this. He hurriedly laughed, \u201cThat is only natural\u2026 may I know just why First Elder has called me over?\u201d</p><br/><p>The First Elder exchanged looks with the other three Elders. She hesitated for a moment before slowly speaking, \u201cWhen we were baptising the clan leader, the four of use used a secret method. We seemed to have found a small lifeforce in the clan leader\u2019s womb\u2026 it seems that it is a sign of pregnancy.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

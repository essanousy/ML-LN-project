A moment later, a thumb-sized purple-red crystal quietly appeared. After which, it quickly moved before transforming into a purple-red light that ruthlessly shot into Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s body violently trembled when that purple-red crystal shot into his heart. Fortunately, that crystal ended up merging with his heart in a mysterious way. Once it merged with his heart, threads of purple-red light were emitted, causing his heart to beat with greater strength\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The blood pool in the outside world suddenly exploded the moment the purple-red crystal shot into Xiao Yan\u2019s heart. A blood fog scattered in all directions, spreading over a large portion of the hall\u2026</p><br/><p>Xun Er was seated beside the blood pool. The blood fog that drifted over automatically disappeared when it was five feet away from her, but her eyes did not move because of this. They continued to stare at Xiao Yan in the pool, whose eyed were still tightly shut. Her hands were tightly clenched because of her anxiousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Xuan by the side heaved a long sigh. A wild joy surfaced within his eyes as both of his hands rubbed against each other. He muttered in excitement, \u201cSuccess\u2026 it has really succeeded\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Xiao Xuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er\u2019s tensed heart finally relaxed when she saw Xiao Xuan\u2019s excitement. She hurriedly called out.</p><br/><p>Xiao Xuan swiftly recovered his calm after hearing Xun Er\u2019s cry. He smiled as her and spoke as though he had been relieved of a huge burden. \u201cSuccess\u2026 three types of bloodlines have successfully been merged\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er\u2019s face, which had been strained for a month, finally revealed an enchanting smile when she heard Xiao Xuan confirm what he said. The huge rock that had pushed on her heart completely vanished. Too many unexpected changes had occurred during this one month. Even with her resolve, she still felt her soul stir with every change. Any slight mistake during these changes would have been unacceptable.</p><br/><p>Xiao Xuan wiped the cold sweat off of his forehead. Xun Er had been worried, but he hadn\u2019t been calm either. Xiao Yan was the only hope of revitalizing the Xiao clan. Xiao Xuan valued this seedling even more than anyone else. If any mishap befall Xiao Yan, he would become the true sinner of the Xiao clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe bloodline has been successfully merged\u2026 however, there is only a small amount of Gu clan bloodline and Dragon Phoenix bloodline. This, this new bloodline strength will not be able to spread all over Xiao Yan\u2019s body at the moment. Hence, the only possible place to stick this bloodline is deep within his heart where he can gradually cultivate it. Once there is a sufficient amount of this newly formed bloodline strength, when it flows all through Xiao Yan\u2019s bloodline, it will finally have fully matured\u2026 at that time, whether Xiao Yan can break through the Dou Sheng class and advance to the Di class, which no one has reached in a thousand of years, will depend on Xiao Yan\u2019s fate.\u201d Xiao Xuan looked at Xiao Yan in the blood pool and slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>Xun Er nodded. Although the quantity of this newly formed bloodline was small, it could be considered a seed. Now that this seed had been planted, what they needed to do was to wait for this seed to grow into a truly towering tree\u2026 at that time, the Dou Qi continent would tremble because of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext, let\u2019s wait for him to completely inherit the energy that I have left behind. This will take quite a while. You should quietly train here during this period of time. The energy here is the densest in the Heavenly Tomb and will allow you to gain much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Xuan glanced at the blood pool where wave after wave of dense solid-like energy was present deep within the blood pool. It continuously flowed into Xiao Yan\u2019s body. Xiao Xuan clearly understood that the current Xiao Yan was beginning to absorb the energy that he had left behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er gently nodded. Her pretty eyes stared at Xiao Yan in the blood pool for a moment. Only after seeing that nothing was amiss did she relax. She slowly shut her eyes and entered her training state.</p><br/><p>Xiao Xuan smiled after seeing Xun Er enter her training state. He looked at Xiao Yan in the blood pool and softly muttered, \u201cThis little fellow does possess a great charm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Being the former clan head of the Xiao clan, Xiao Xuan naturally understood that a member of the ancient clan who possessed a divine bloodline would gradually approach a perfect state of mind as they became older. Under such perfection, they would seldom possess any special feelings for the opposite sex. Hence, his heart was full of disbelief that Xun Er would do so much for Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>However, he was unaware that the beginning of the feelings between the two had started to brew when they were very young\u2026</p><br/><p>After completely resolving the problem of the bloodline in Xiao Yan\u2019s body, Xiao Xuan couldn\u2019t do anything else since everything else that needed to be done was Xiao Yan\u2019s responsibility. If he were to continue helping, he would really hinder Xiao Yan in an effort to help. That would not benefit Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>It was just as Xiao Xuan had mentioned. Xiao Yan took quite a long time to absorb the energy that he had left behind. During this time, Xun Er, who had become a little weak after losing quite a lot of essence blood, swiftly entered her training state. Hence, the entire large hall had become dead quiet. Fortunately, Xiao Xuan was used to such an atmosphere after all these years. He did not feel lonely\u2026</p><br/><p>Time swiftly flowed by like the sand between one\u2019s fingers amid this quiet atmosphere...</p><br/><p>Time flew and in the blink of an eye, one year had already trickled by in this ancient hall\u2026</p><br/><p>Xun Er had spent most of this one year training. The energy here was the richest in the Heavenly Tomb. Hence, she had gained a lot during this one year. Not only did she recover over half of the bloodline strength that she had exhausted, even her aura had become a little stronger. Of course, at this level, the increase in her strength had already become very slow. At the very least, this slow speed was still significantly faster within this tomb.</p><br/><p>When Xun Er occasionally woke from her training, she would study Xiao Yan, who was statue-like in the blood pool. Xiao Yan did not show the slightest sign of opening his eyes during this one year. The extremely rich energy also appeared to be endless as it continuously poured into his body. Although the pouring in of the energy was extremely frightening, Xun Er did not feel stunned because she knew that only when the final cluster of energy poured into Xiao Yan\u2019s body would it truly erupt!</p><br/><p>During this one year, Xiao Xuan guarded the blood pool without leaving. He watched the blood pool gradually become clearer as Xiao Yan absorbed it. The smile on his face also became richer. After all, this was the only fortune that he could give Xiao Yan\u2026</p><br/><p>Time quickly flowed by while Xun Er formed a cycle between being awake and training. Fortunately, it was possible to tell from the clearing pool that the majestic energy contained within it had diminished as Xiao Yan absorbed a little at a time\u2026</p><br/><p>The blood pool became even clearer. Around a year and a half after Xiao Yan had entered the blood pool, the final thread of blood color completely disappeared. At this moment, the pond once again recovered its clear and serene appearance from when Xiao Yan had first arrived.</p><br/><p>The moment the final trace of energy poured into Xiao Yan\u2019s body, Xiao Xuan and Xun Er appeared to have sensed something. They opened their eyes at almost the same time, and they stared at Xiao Yan, who still had his eyes shut.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan did not show any changes as the two of them looked at him. Even his breathing was as calm as ever. However, Xiao Xuan and Xun Er were naturally able to sense the frightening energy within Xiao Yan\u2019s body. It was like a volcano that was about to erupt\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>This silence continued for around half an hour. That pond, which was so calm that it was void of even the slightest ripple, suddenly exploded like thunder. An enormous water pillar shot out and scattered into the air. A torrential storm came pouring down.</p><br/><p>Xiao Xuan and Xun Er ignored the storm that came pouring down. Their eyes did not blink as they locked onto Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHis aura has begun to soar\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Xuan\u2019s face twitched as he opened his mouth to inform Xun Er.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Xuan\u2019s words had just sounded when a vast and mighty aura suddenly surged out of Xiao Yan\u2019s body. This aura began to rapidly soar at a frightening speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeak of the sixth star\u2026 seventh star\u2026 peak of the seventh star\u2026 eighth star\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Xuan and Xun Er sensed Xiao Yan\u2019s soaring aura, which seemed unstoppable. Their expressions had become more and more grave.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s already at the ninth star\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Within less than ten minutes, Xiao Yan\u2019s aura had risen from the sixth star to the ninth star. Moreover, this kind of increase still showed signs of continuing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fast approaching the peak of the ninth star\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Another two minutes passed. Xun Er\u2019s face once again revealed some worry. If Xiao Yan\u2019s aura were to stop here, his chances of advancing to the Dou Sheng class would become slim.</p><br/><p>Xiao Xuan appeared quite calm, but his knit brows betrayed the anxiety in his heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s aura finally soared to the peak of the ninth star in front of Xiao Xuan and Xun Er\u2019s anxious eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, if this continues, you will completely halt at this level\u2026\u201d Xun Er revealed an anxious expression as she tightly clenched her hand.</p><br/><p>Xiao Xuan\u2019s face was solemn. If Xiao Yan were unable to resist the temptation of this great increase in strength, his achievements would halt at this point. Losing oneself because of some easily obtained strength would mean that one would not go very far in the future\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, you are the last hope of the Xiao clan. Do not disappoint me\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

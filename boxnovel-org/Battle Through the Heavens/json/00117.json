Tilting his head and glancing at the Fairy Doctor who had finished digging out all the medicinal plants, he smiled and said, \u201cHurry over here. I don\u2019t want to be accused of trying to pocket everything when I open these boxes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least you have some sort of conscience.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fairy Doctor raised her nose, carried the ten plus bottles in her chest and placed them on the stone table. Finally, she unwillingly selected six bottles and handed them to Xiao Yan: \u201cHey, these are yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan received them with a smile, took a brief glance and stored them into his storage ring. The Ice Spirit Blazing Grass was already in his hands so the other valuable medicinal plants were not very important to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved the three black keys in front of the Fairy Doctor and smiled: \u201cThen I will be opening them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen them!\u201d After throwing Xiao Yan an irritated look, the Fairy Doctor quickly slotted the jade bottles around her waist and chest. Immediately, her narrow waist appeared much fuller than before.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan licked his lips as he stared at the stone containers. He randomly selected one of the keys, lifted the first lock and carefully inserted it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot this\u2026\u201d The key stuck halfway causing Xiao Yan to shrug and replace it with a second key.</p><br/><p>\u201cWrong again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Helplessly shaking his head, Xiao Yan held the last key tightly and once again carefully inserted it into the keyhole.</p><br/><p>Seeing the key slowly disappearing into the lock, Xiao Yan and the Fairy Doctor both unintentionally held their breath. The only noise in the entire room came from the key being pushed through the keyhole of the metal lock.</p><br/><p>\u201cClang\u2026\u201d Suddenly, a light clear noise was emitted from within the room, prompting Xiao Yan\u2019s hand to freeze.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s unlocked.\u201d Seeing the lock\u2019s shackle being launched from the lock, Xiao Yan let out a relieved sigh and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and open it.\u201d The Fairy Doctor\u2019s face was full of desire and happiness as she said in an impatient voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan glanced at the anxious Fairy Doctor but did not heed her call. Instead, he grabbed her hand and stepped back. He then lined up his palm with the box and unleashed an intense force from his palm which lifted the lid of the stone box.</p><br/><p>After the lid was lifted, Xiao Yan waited a moment longer and sighed in relief after seeing that there was no reaction. Glancing at the Fairy Doctor who had her hands around her chest while coldly staring at him, Xiao Yan simply shrugged, \u201cIt is always good to be a little careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are thrown into the Magic Beast Mountain Range, I think that you will have a happier time living there than in the outside world. The reason being that even those Magic Beasts are not as careful as you are.\u201d The Fairy Doctor curled her lips and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI share the same thoughts.\u201d Xiao Yan touched his nose and laughed.</p><br/><p>After throwing a cutting gaze at the shameless man beside her, the Fairy Doctor walked towards the stone table. She looked into the opened stone box and was shocked. With a face filled with joy, she quickly reached her hand into it and retrieved an ancient rainbow colored scroll.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Xiao Yan curiously looked over and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Poison Book that records the methods of making poison.\u201d The Fairy Doctor flipped open the scroll and said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Poison Book?\u201d Raising his eyebrow in surprise, Xiao Yan took the scroll from the Fairy Doctor\u2019s hand and glanced through it. Seeing the few words written on the side of the seven colored scroll, Xiao Yan said in amazement: \u201cRainbow Poison Book? There is actually something that focuses on how to create poison? Don\u2019t tell me that the one who left this behind was also a physician?\u201d</p><br/><p>Physicians were usually the only ones in the Dou Qi continent who used poison to protect themselves. These people who excelled at using such positions were usually called Poison Master within the continent. However, the status of a Poison Master was still a far cry from that of an alchemist.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps so. But you\u2019re not allowed to split this with me. Due to my elemental affinity, I cannot become an alchemist so I can only rely on these things.\u201d A dejected expression appeared on the Fairy Doctor\u2019s face after she spoke. It was clear that her greatest desire was to become an alchemist and not a Poison Master that people both hated and disliked.</p><br/><p>Eyeing the dejected looking Fairy Doctor, Xiao Yan smiled, handed over the seven colored scroll and said, \u201cThis is quite a good thing but it would require much time and effort in order to master it. Just training\u2026 Dou Qi consumes all of my energy. I\u2019m not stupid enough to start on something else, biting off more than I can chew.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fairy Doctor felt a deep relief in her heart upon hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words and gave the latter a grateful nod.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can put away what you have in your hands. I may not be considered a gentleman but given our our current relationship as partners, I would not try to take everything for myself.\u201d Eyeing the Fairy Doctor who was slowing putting away the rainbow scroll, Xiao Yan smiled and said in a bland voice.</p><br/><p>The Fairy Doctor\u2019s face was stunned as embarrassment surfaced. She unclenched her hand, revealing a small bag of green powder on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d Being caught red handed by Xiao Yan, the red faced Fairy Doctor was at a loss for words.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. Being a women, it is only natural for you to take some preventive measures when you come with me in search for treasures.\u201d Xiao Yan shrugged and said indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you.\u201d Once again, the Fairy Doctor gave a grateful thanks as she hurriedly put away the green powder in her hand.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan touched his face and shifted his gaze towards the second stone container. He inserted a key in and slowly probed the interior.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was the effect of the green powder?\u201d As the key in his hand was slowly being inserted deeper into the lock, Xiao Yan randomly threw out a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis was made with Drunken Dragon Grass and a couple of other medicinal ingredients with a sedative effect. Once it is breathed into the body, it would cause one to fall asleep for at least half a day. But this powder is only a simple poison. Anyone with some strength would be able to use Dou Qi to suppress the effect and force it out of the body.\u201d The Fairy Doctor embarrassingly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cLuckily it is not some lethal poison. At least you are not so vicious.\u201d Xiao Yan rubbed his lips together, rotated his wrist and smiled: \u201cIt\u2019s opened.\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Xiao Yan\u2019s voice, the tightly shut stone box began to slowly open.</p><br/><p>Under the light of the Moonstones, everything in the stone box was immediately revealed to Xiao Yan and the Fairy Doctor.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother scroll?\u201d Xiao Yan lifted his eyebrow upon noticing a black scroll that was placed in the box.</p><br/><p>He reached his hand into the box, took the scroll out and flipped through it. Finally, his gaze paused on the small words at the edge of the scroll: \u201cHigh Xuan Flying Dou Technique: Eagle Wing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlying Dou Technique?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes gradually became bigger as he muttered the unfamiliar words. In his shock, he said with a hoarse voice: \u201cThis is actually a rare Flying Dou Technique?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlying Dou Technique? What is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this name for the first time, the Fairy Doctor blinked her eyes doubtfully. She had heard of Attack Dou Techniques, Defense Dou Techniques, Agility Dou Technique and many others but it was the first time she had heard of a Flying Dou Technique.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs the name suggest, this Dou Technique can allow a person to fly in the air.\u201d Xiao Yan smacked his lips in surprise as he explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cFly? Isn\u2019t that something that requires the strength of at least a Dou Ling?\u201d The Fairy Doctor displayed an initial shock at the explanation before appearing confused.</p><br/><p>In the Dou Qi continent, only with the strength of a Dou Ling can one leave the ground and fly for a short distance. Only after one\u2019s strength had reached that of a Dou Wang or Dou Huang can one use the Dou Qi to form a pair of energy wings on one\u2019s back. These wings would enable them to overcome their bond to the ground and fly amongst the clouds.</p><br/><p>As for the Flying Dou Techniques, they were a strange secret technique that could enable the practitioner to form two small extensions that protruded from the veins on one\u2019s back. With these two extension, one would be able to form a pair of wings and fly in the air even if one did not possess the strength of a Dou Wang.</p><br/><p>Flying was something that was a great temptation to many. In order to fulfill this temptation, many strong people put in all their effort to reach for the unreachable dream of becoming a Dou Wang. At the same time, there were also many who wanted to find a shortcut by finding this rare and valuable Flying Type Dou Technique.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly let out a long breath as he held the black scroll in his hand. He forcefully suppressed the happiness in him before waving his hand at the Fairy Doctor.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know. This goes to you right?\u201d Having observed Xiao Yan\u2019s action, the Fairy Doctor understood his intention and helplessly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, everyone takes what they require.\u201d Xiao Yan grinned. His acquisitions today had almost caused his face to be paralysed from smiling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s still one more. Let\u2019s hurry. We will leave once we open it.\u201d the Fairy Doctor shifted her gaze to the last stone box and urged.</p><br/><p>\u201cHum.\u201d With his two acquisitions, Xiao Yan\u2019s body was full of energy. He held the last key that was not used and prepared to open the stone box.</p><br/><p>The spacious room once again became quiet. Just as Xiao Yan bent his body and was about to open the box, he suddenly stiffened. He quickly turned around and his face suddenly became dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Hearing the words, the Fairy Doctor was also shocked. An instant later, she shook her head: \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. Only the two of us know about this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have not misheard. There are quite a few people.\u201d Xiao Yan looked at the Fairy Doctor with a terrible face. A coldness flashed in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou suspect that I have called these people over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s expression, anger erupted on the Fairy Doctor\u2019s face. \u201cHad I wanted to harm you, you would have died many times over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the anger on the Fairy Doctor\u2019s face appeared genuine, Xiao Yan pressed his eyebrows together and quickly turned around. He attempted to insert the key in his hand into the lock but in his anxiousness, he repeatedly failed to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d Letting out a cry of anger, Xiao Yan grabbed the stone box with both hands in an attempt to lift it. Unfortunately, he found that the container was stuck onto the stone table.</p><br/><p>\u201cStupid.\u201d Xiao Yan once again scolded with an ashen face before slowly letting out a breath. In a cold voice, he said: \u201cThey are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words, the Little Doctor quickly directed her gaze towards the rock door. Her ears had also picked up the sound of footsteps approaching.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, Fairy Doctor. Thank you for leading the way. It seemed that the information we managed to get was true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Over ten figures slowly entered from the darkness outside the door while the familiar and pleased laughter echoed within the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Li!\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing the voice, the Fairy Doctor immediately clenched her teeth tightly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

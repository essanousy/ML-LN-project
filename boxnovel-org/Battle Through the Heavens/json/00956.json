A long while later, she finally cried out in surprise, \u201cXiao Yan? Why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan spread his hands. It would be a long story if he were to answer that.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Sis, are you acquainted with mister Xiao Yan?\u201d Han Xue was similarly stunned when Han Yue called out Xiao Yan\u2019s name. The matters of this world could not be so coincidental, could they?</p><br/><p>Han Yue\u2019s pretty eyes stared at Xiao Yan. A moment later, she let out a sweet smile. Her gorgeous blooming-flower-like smile caused the tense atmosphere within the hall to lessen a little. Her beautiful eyes roamed once around Xiao Yan before she teasingly said, \u201cI am naturally acquainted with him. If we were to talk about it, I can be considered his senior in school.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, is this little brother also a student of the Inner Academy in the Jia Nan Academy? It is rumored that the requirement the Inner Academy place on accepting students is extremely strict. By being able to enter it, this little brother should also be an extremely talented individual.\u201d The middle-aged man in brilliant clothes by the side smiled as he spoke at this moment. These words were not empty words. He had weighed Xiao Yan in detail when he had first appeared. After which, he was surprised to discover that even he, who had half a foot in the Dou Zong class, was unable to clearly see the bottom line of this young man\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my father, the clan head of the Han clan, Han Chi.\u201d Han Xue softly introduced Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is more than just a talented individual. He dared to challenge an expert Dou Huang when he was just a Da Dou Shi. After entering the Inner Academy for less than a year, he had become a top three existence in the Strong Ranking. This kind of guts and talent is incomparable within the Inner Academy.\u201d Han Yue covered her mouth and softly laughed. Her elegant demeanor was extremely attractive.</p><br/><p>The expressions of the members of the Han clan in the hall changed a little when they heard her words. They had a clear understanding of the Jia Nan Academy. Naturally, they knew that most of the students there possessed great talent. Moreover, those who could become the top individuals there were all undoubtedly extremely outstanding people. It was unexpected that this seemingly ordinary man actually possessed such a background.</p><br/><p>Han Xue also turned her head to look at Xiao Yan. She was surprised after hearing Han Yue\u2019s words. The brilliance in her pretty eyes was even denser. She had heard Han Yue mention the so-called Strong Ranking in the Jia Nan Academy. Even with Han Yue\u2019s talent, she could could be ranked behind the top ten. Those people in the top ten were all extremely talented individuals. The top three might have to be described with the word \u2018monster\u2019...</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Han Yue has praised me a little too much. Those things are only because I have good luck.\u201d Xiao Yan bitterly laughed as he shook his head when he saw Han Yue praising him.</p><br/><p>Han Yue smiled slightly. Seeing that Xiao Yan did not wish to get entangled over these matters, she changed the topic and asked somewhat curiously, \u201cWhy are you together with Xue-er?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xue by the side quickly took over the conversation when she heard this. She roughly spoke about what had happened in the desert and the things that had happened along the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened\u2026 we really have to thank little brother Xiao Yan. If you had not leant a hand, it is likely that my young daughter and the Han clan\u2019s convoy would have difficulty escaping from calamity.\u201d The brilliantly robed man\u2019s expression changed when he heard Han Xue explain the unexpected events along the way. He immediately stood up, cupped his hands to Xiao Yan, and spoke with a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cClan Head Han is too courteous. It is only natural that I return the favor after being rescued by others.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, since you are acquainted with Yue-er and you are also Xue-er\u2019s savior, you can call me uncle Han if you do not dislike it. The term clan head Han is really too unfamiliar.\u201d Han Xhi waved his head and laughed in a clear voice.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan found it difficult to reject and could only nod his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, is the Hong clan here to create trouble again?\u201d Seeing that both parties were briefly acquainted, Han Xue suddenly bunched up her eyebrows and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, the Hong clan has always wanted to dominate the Tian Bei City alone. They have always seen our Han clan as an eyesore. It was nothing in the past when our strength were approximately the same. However, Hong Chen has recently returned to Tian Bei City. It is rumored that he has already become an Inner Hall disciple in the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion. His status is already very different from the past. Using this, the Hong clan\u2019s reputation has also soared. Currently, many neutral factions within Tian Bei City are already leaning toward the Hong clan.\u201d Han Chi sighed as he explained the situation.</p><br/><p>Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion? Isn\u2019t it Wind Lightning Pavilion?\u201d Xiao Yan asked Han Xue in a somewhat doubtful soft voice when he heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Wind Lightning Pavilion is divided into four pavilions, namely the north, south, east, and west. They are situated in the four corners of the northern region of the Central Plains. That Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion is on the Qi Feng Mountain five hundred kilometers from Tian Bei City. Hong Chen is the Inner Hall disciple of the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion.\u201d Han Xue explained.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan finally came to a sudden understanding. Immediately, he once again felt shocked at the strength of the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Just a branch pavilion was sufficient to cause the Han clan such fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough part of the reason that Hong Chen has made such a request for your sister and you to marry him is because you and your sister have caught his eye, a greater part of it is perhaps because he is planning to gradually erode our Han clan\u2026 I will naturally not agree to such a request and trick. The Hong clan might be powerful, but it is likely that they would suffer a great loss if they were to really attack our Han clan.\u201d Han Chi slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>Han Xue tightened her hand and coldly said, \u201cTherefore, that fellow has proposed such a request to get a person from the same generation to fight him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 the most outstanding person in the Han clan from the same generation is your elder sister. However, she has currently only just advanced to the Dou Huang class. Moreover, this is because she had a special encounter. That Hong Chen, however, is at the very least a seven star Dou Huang level. Adding the many high class Dou Skills from the Wind Lightning Pavilion, Han Yue is no match for him.\u201d Han Chi bitterly laughed and continued, \u201cMoreover, forget about the Han clan. Among the same generation within Tian Bei City, one would be hard pressed to find someone who could contend with Hong Chen. Hong Chen is naturally full of confidence to boldly mention such a condition\u2026 hence, the Han clan does indeed have some trouble this time around\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt might be a little troublesome, but it is not impossible to resolve. Of course, the precondition is if someone is willing to lend a hand\u2026\u201d Han Yue smiled and suddenly piped up.</p><br/><p>Numerous gazes in the hall immediately took the hint and were thrown to Xiao Yan after they heard her words. Han Xue also nodded her head by the side. \u201cThat\u2019s right. Mister Xiao Yan is very strong. If he can help, he will be able to defeat Hong Chen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily felt somewhat helpless upon being looked at by so many people. These two sisters had a coldness that kept people at a great distance on their surface. However, they seemed to hide a cunningness under that coldness.</p><br/><p>Han Yue clenched her silver teeth when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s helpless expression. She immediately took a couple of steps forward and used a voice that only the both of them could hear, \u201cXiao Yan, this matter is extremely important to my Han clan. Hopefully, you can lend a hand on account of our relationship in the past. At the very most, I will not bother you about how you secretly took the Core Quenching Body Milk that I found.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression immediately became embarrassed when he heard this. He awkwardly asked, \u201cSenior Han Xue, you\u2026 how did you know about that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you forgotten that the big ape guarding the Core Quenching Body Milk kndw how to speak the human language?\u201d Han Yue softly laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled bitterly. It had actually been that beast\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you say?\u201d Han Yue\u2019s gaze was locked onto Xiao Yan. Her pretty eyes contained a begging expression.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan entered his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Xiao Yan had become quiet, Han Yue was involuntarily a little disappointed. She gently bit the her lower lip, appearing to summon up her courage. She said, \u201cAs long as you can help my Han clan through this crisis, I\u2026 I\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you also thinking of becoming my concubine?\u201d The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth twitched as he continued her words.</p><br/><p>A redness surged onto Han Yue\u2019s pretty face when she heard this. Even her lovely ear tips had become fiery hot.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, don\u2019t say this. I am really afraid\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan bitterly laughed. They were indeed sisters. Could their hearts resonate with each other? They knew just what he was most afraid of\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot guarantee anything. All I can say is that I will try my best\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan sighed. Perhaps it was because he felt a little apologetic for having secretly stolen the Core Quenching Body Milk that Han Yue had found. Hence, Xiao Yan nodded slowly after musing for a moment.</p><br/><p>Surprise surfaced in Han Yue\u2019s pretty eyes when she saw Xiao Yan nod his head. Her eyes were shining as she stared at him, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan could only nod once again under the focus of those shiny eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, since Hong Chen was the one who threw out those words that said his opponent would be counted as long as it was someone of his generation regardless of whether that person was a member of the Han clan, mister Xiao Yan would definitely be the best choice.\u201d Han Xue smiled sweetly toward Xiao Yan before turning around to speak to Han Chi.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, as your father, I will naturally trust your eyesight. However, this matter has too great of an implication. Although little brother Xiao Yan was able to capture Hong Lie and Hong Mu alive, this point is something that Hong Chen can also do. Being a disciple of the Wind Lightning Pavilion, he knows many powerful high class Dou Techniques . Forget about those of the same level, even those who are one or two stars stronger than him would likely have difficulty completely defeating him. These words might cause a blotch to form on little brother Xiao Yan\u2019s heart, but knives and swords don\u2019t have eyes in such a match. If any accident happens to you as a result, our Han clan would feel extremely sorry\u2026\u201d Han Chi hesitated for a moment before speaking with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, you don\u2019t believe that mister Xiao Yan can defeat Hong Chen?\u201d Han Xue by the side stomped her foot. She had spent a great amount of breath in order to invite this great-god-like being over. If these words of Han Chi were to offend him, where would she go crying to?</p><br/><p>Han Chi could only smile bitterly as he was questioned by his two daughters in this manner. It was not that he did not trust Xiao Yan, but Hong Chen\u2019s strength was indeed too great. If they were to lose this match, it would affect the rest of Han Yue\u2019s life. Forget about him, it was likely that the entire Han clan, with the exception of these two girls, would not dare to be so careless\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cXue-er, Yue-er, there is no need to continue forcing elder brother. Why don\u2019t we do this. Since the both of you have such confidence in this little brother Xiao Yan, why don\u2019t you allow uncle to come forward and test him? After all, this matter concerns the survival of the Han clan and cannot afford even the slightest oversight\u2026\u201d A middle-aged man who appeared around forty or so slowly stood up and smiled as he suggested something to Han Xue and Han Yue.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as this little brother Xiao Yan is able to endure my attacks for ten exchanges without being defeated, we will allow him to participate in this match. What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xue and Han Yue hesitated a moment when they heard this. They exchanged gazes with one another before turning their heads to look at Xiao Yan. They spoke in a somewhat uncertain soft manner, \u201cThis is my second uncle Han Tian. His strength is around that of an eight star Dou Huang. You\u2026 do you have the confidence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan similarly understood the importance of the match with Hong Chen toward the Han clan and Han Yue. Hence, he was a little moved by the confidence Han Xue and Han Yue had in him. They were betting their entire fate on him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan softly laughed. He slowly stepped forward, cupped his hands toward Han Tian, and said, \u201cIf I am struck by you even once within ten exchanges, I will cease mentioning this matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire hall was in an uproar the moment these words sounded!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

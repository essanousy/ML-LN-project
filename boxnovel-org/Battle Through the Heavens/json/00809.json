Xiao Yan finally recovered a moment later. He immediately let out an intense, dry cough when he saw the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s embarrassed red face of, and hurriedly turned his gaze away.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s cough caused the Little Fairy Doctor to be pulled out from the slight giddy feeling that was transmitted from her head. Her lovely, naked body was just like a beautiful mermaid as she entered the rock pool with a splashing sound. Finally, her alluring body, that caused one to daydream, was covered by that dark-black pool of water.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also felt somewhat embarrassed when he saw the circular ripples within the rock pool. This matter really did not have much relation with him. The Dou Qi within his body had just completed a cycle when he had unexpectedly opened his eyes to this scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cSplash!\u201d</p><br/><p>The pool of water not far away emitted a ripple while Xiao Yan was feeling embarrassed. Immediately, a somewhat bright-red alluring face rose from the pool. However, the Little Fairy Doctor only revealed her head this time around. The remaining parts of her body were completely covered by the dark-black water in the pool.</p><br/><p>The face of the Little Fairy Doctor still contained a faint redness from her embarrassment when it was revealed. If the people from the Poison Sect were to see her obedient, womanly manners, it was likely that they would be so shocked that their jaws would fall. Who would expect this Sky Poison Woman, whose fierce reputation within the Chu Yun Empire could frighten anyone who heard it, could actually reveal such a moving, lovely blush.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*... this\u2026 that\u2026 what are you doing?\u201d Xiao Yan dryly laughed as he glanced at the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s rebuking eyes in an awkward manner.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor felt speechless when she heard this. She rolled her eyes at Xiao Yan and snapped, \u201cWhat am I doing? I am helping you suppress the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan continued to dryly laugh as he rubbed his head. He actually felt somewhat restrained. This was the first time in his life that he was facing a naked woman in a pool.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor rejoiced upon seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s rare embarrassment. She immediately let out a soft laugh.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan felt somewhat absent-minded when he saw her beautiful lips ripple into a smile. Such a gentle smile was as moving as it was back in Qingshan Town.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still look better when you smile.\u201d Xiao Yan quietly commented.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor was startled. She immediately lowered her eyes as a delicate jade-like arm was extended from from the pool. It randomly cut through the pool water as she softly said, \u201cI am called the Sky Poison Woman in this Chu Yun Empire. In the future, I will forever be unable to make contact with anyone as long as the hidden danger of the \u2018Woeful Poison Body\u2019 is still present. The \u2018Woeful Poison Body\u2019 will gain an increasing harm to the people around me as it approaches the time it will completely erupt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan softly sighed as he studied the Little Fairy Doctor, who displayed a bitterness on the corner of her mouth. He said, \u201cRelax, I will do my best to help you find the necessary ingredients needed to control the \u2018Woeful Poison Body\u2019. Once you are able to perfectly control the \u2018Woeful Poison Body\u2019, all of your problems will naturally be resolved.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor faintly smiled. She forcefully braced her attention as her delicate arm danced. Like a beautiful mermaid, she slowly arrived in front of Xiao Yan. Her pretty eyes stared at the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 on Xiao Yan\u2019s chest before nodding. She said, \u201cThe speed the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 is spreading has already slowed a lot. With the ability of this pool of poison water, it should not be able to have an obvious effect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, there are three kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 within my body. An ordinary lethal poison does not have much effect on me. This \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 might not be in this category, but the three kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 at the very least pose some obstruction to it.\u201d Xiao Yan laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cA \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is indeed mysterious. It is actually even able to suppress a \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 left behind by an elite Dou Zong to such an extent. No wonder it is a powerful force that is most coveted by people on this content\u2026\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor nodded her head while feeling surprised. She immediately voiced her thoughts, \u201cHowever, this is still insufficient. Next, I will use my body as a channel, allowing the poison in the pool to pass through my body and conduct a complete suppression of the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019. This way, it should be able to help you achieve sufficient time to go and look for an elite Dou Zun to help you remove the poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. He said in a deep voice, \u201cIn that case, I will trouble you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you need to be so courteous?\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor rebuked Xiao Yan with a stare. A bright-redness surfaced on her face as she whispered, \u201cClose your eyes. Do not open them without my permission!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan understood her when he heard her command. He laughed before slowly shutting his eyes.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor only sighed in relief after seeing Xiao Yan shut his eyes. Her delicate hand swung in front of her while the back of her teeth gently bit her lower red lip. Only then did she slowly stand up in the pool.</p><br/><p>A naked body that was as white as an elephant\u2019s tusk surfaced from the pool. The dark-black water followed her alluring lines as it slowly rolled down. Finally, it dripped into the pool, forming circular ripples.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s body was completely exposed in front of Xiao Yan, who had his eyes tightly shut. Even though he currently had his eyes shut, the Little Fairy Doctor still felt that her face seemed to be burning like a flame. It was so hot that it was frightening.</p><br/><p>Taking a couple of deep breaths, she suppressed that strange feeling in her heart. The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s hands slightly trembled and a small suction appeared from within her body. Immediately, with her body as the center, a vortex appeared in the pool. As the vortex turned quicker and quicker, a thread of pitch black poison sudden was absorbed into the Little Fairy\u2019s body. Under her control, it sped through her body and finally agglomerated on her long finger.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s delicate jade-like finger transformed into a dark-black color. Her face was somewhat solemn as a fingernail gently pressed against the finger that had already turned a dark-black color.</p><br/><p>Following the pressure of her fingernail, one could see a drop of unusually bright-red blood appearing. The blood drop that had appeared did not fall. Instead, it remained firmly adhered to the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s fingernail, appearing like a tiny glaring blood pearl.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s face grew slightly solemn as she observed this droplet of blood. The poison within this blood was the most terrifying Woeful Poison Blood. Even with Xie Bi Yan\u2019s Dou Zong class strength, he ended up dying because of it. This was sufficient to see the potentness of this poisonous thing.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor slowly exhaled a breath of air as she focused her mind. A moment later, her delicate finger moved slowly and finally paused above the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 on Xiao Yan\u2019s chest. She hesitated for a moment before immediately clenching her silver teeth as her delicate hand danced!</p><br/><p>One could see threads of black-colored fine lines shooting from the tip of the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s fingers as they danced. Finally they twined and formed a mysterious seal surrounding the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019. Each time the tiny black-colored lines erupted, they would come into contact with that drop of the Woeful Poison Blood on her fingernail. The threads of blood would then adhere to it.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 appeared to have sensed something following the encirclement of the black-colored threads. A countless number of potent poison lines suddenly shot out. They were just like a countless number of sharp arrows that shot toward the surrounding seal.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Fairy Doctor immediately let out a cold snort when she saw the change of the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019. The dancing speed of the tips of her fingers suddenly increased. The black seal line also became increasingly thicker.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 line shot toward that thick seal, but it was immediately reflected back.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor sighed in relief when she saw that the erosion of the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 failed. However, that \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 viciously spat an extremely poisonous black line that was as thick as a thumb just before the seal was completed.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s face changed slightly upon seeing this vicious attack. Her delicate fingers danced at an increased pace. In the end, numerous afterimages were formed.</p><br/><p>The lethal poison in the black line collided with that seal an instant later. However, this time around it was not reflected back. This lethal poisonous black line contained an extremely great amount of Dou Qi. Under the support of this large amount of Dou Qi, the lethal poison in the black line tore at the seal in a brutal manner. Finally, it became like a huge savage snake as it rushed at the seal.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s eyes were icy-cold as she watched the layers of seals get torn apart by the lethal poison of the black line. Her finger was suddenly flicked just before they were completely broken. The drop of Woeful Poison Blood on the tip of her finger rushed out before being scattered on that mysterious seal.</p><br/><p>That seal immediately unleashed a bright-red color as the Woeful Poison Blood was poured in. A countless number of black lines wiggled. They formed a dragonet shape!</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The lethal poison of the black line violently collided with the other black lines that had formed a net and carried a thread of bright-redness. Its charging speed immediately began to slow. A couple of breaths later, it completely stiffened just before it broke through the seal.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor did not sigh in relief when she saw this. Her fingers danced and she finished sealing this seal. The moment her hand moved, the completely solidified lethal poison in the black line was like a cannon barrel as it shrank. Suddenly, it shot a thread of a tiny black line amid a pouncing sound. Finally, it broke through the last layer of seal!</p><br/><p>The hand seal of the Little Fairy Doctor was instantly completed when that thread of black line broke through. Immediately, the seal around the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 emitted a bright-red glow that completely secured the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 within it!</p><br/><p>Once the seal was completed, the Little Fairy Doctor discovered that the lethal poison of the black line was fleeing. Her face immediately changed.</p><br/><p>Just when she was planning to destroy this thread of fleeing \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019, she was surprised to discover that the temperature on the surface of Xiao Yan\u2019s body had become much hotter. A faint cluster of jade-green flames appeared around that black line, which was randomly fleeing. The flame completely wrapped around the black line. From the looks of it, the flame seemed intent on refining the latter.</p><br/><p>That black line began to wildly churn upon being fiercely burned by that jade-green flame. The enormous amount of Dou Qi contained within it began to be revealed\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow\u2026 he is actually thinking of refining the Dou Qi within this thread of \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 into his own?\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprise immediately rushed through the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s pretty eyes when she saw this scene. Immediately, she let out a sigh of relief within her heart. From the looks of the situation, it seemed that the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 within Xiao Yan\u2019s body still had the ability to refine a line of fleeing poison despite not being able to completely refine the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough this thread of \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 is extremely tiny, the Dou Qi that it contained in it is extremely pure. If he is able to refine it, it might be able to raise his strength. This fellow\u2026 is really bold.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

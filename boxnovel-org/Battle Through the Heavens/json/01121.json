He quickly walked to her and frowned as he asked, \u201cWhat has happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor spread her hands as she glanced at the frowning Xiao Yan. She replied, \u201cThe Ye clan has encountered some trouble\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTrouble? There is still someone who dares to find trouble the Ye clan?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes swept around him and discovered that the Ye clan\u2019s guards, who were originally here, had already left. Clearly, the trouble this time around was not ordinary. However, the thing that caused Xiao Yan to feel a little strange was that there were very few people who dared to find trouble with the Ye clan after the big battle back then. Just who had come this time around?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ones who have come this time around are not an ordinary faction\u2026\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor appeared to understand what Xiao Yan was thinking when she glanced at him. She laughed, \u201cCao clan, one of the five great clans of the Pill Region.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCao clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan knit his brows. He had naturally heard of the five great clans of the Pill Region. This Cao clan was one of them. Of course, this clan could not be compared with the declining Ye clan. There seemed to be a never-ending number of talented alchemists in that clan. This caused the reputation of the Cao clan to grow greater. Other than the Dan clan, which kept an extremely low profile, it was likely that the Cao clan was the strongest among the five great clans.</p><br/><p>Moreover, the Cao clan was considered part of the upper echelons of the Pill Tower. With this backing, even a faction like the Ice River Valley would not dare to easily offend them. After all, everyone in the Central Plains knew about the Pill Tower\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>That was why the Cao clan was on the rise. The influence of the Pill Region was expanding. Compared to the declining Ye clan, one could be considered in the sky while the other was on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy have they come to find trouble with the Ye clan?\u201d Xiao Yan mused. He did not expect the Cao clan to come and interfere.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems to be because of a marriage related to Xin Lan. Back then, when Ye Zhong and the others were in a desperate situation, they had planned to get Xin Lan to marry into the Cao clan. Thus, the Cao clan would be able to help them pass the test. However, the Ye clan would end up being swallowed by the Cao clan. Therefore, the Ye clan gave up on this marriage after you arrived. Who would expect the Cao clan to suddenly come and insist on bringing Xin Lan away\u2026\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor explained the situation.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression slightly sank upon hearing this. This Cao clan was quite overbearing. They might say that they want to marry Xin Lan, but it was likely their intentions were the Ye clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is old mister Yao?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is already present in the front yard, standing guard and preventing the Cao clan from using force\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. He mused for a moment before turning around and heading to the front yard. He gravely said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, I want to see just how great this Cao clan is! This is the first time that I have heard of something like forcefully snatching someone!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor smiled and lowered her chin. She gently shifted her feet and followed close behind.</p><br/><p>A large group of people were currently clustered in the front yard of the Ye clan at this moment. The atmosphere was exceptionally intense, on the brink of breaking into a fight.</p><br/><p>The spacious front yard was clearly divided into two lineups. On one side was Ye clan\u2019s group while on the other side was nearly a hundred pale-red-robed human figures. These people were standing extremely straight. Their auras were quite domineering. Their eyes, watching the Ye clan\u2019s group, revealed the superiority they felt. Of course, the position the current Cao clan had in the Pill Region was not something that the Ye clan could compare with.</p><br/><p>There were two red-robed, old men standing at the front of the Cao clan\u2019s group. These two people wore indifferent expressions. A majestic aura was permeating their bodies. Both of their hands were inserted into their sleeves. From the looks of it, they were not ordinary people. Of course, the one that was the most eye-catching was not these two people. Instead, the most eye-catching were a gray-robed, old man and a young man wearing purple-colored alchemist\u2019s robes.</p><br/><p>The gray-robed, old man appeared to be quite old. His face was filled with heavy wrinkles, and he appeared to be near the end of his life. However, by being able to stand right at the front, one did not even need to use one\u2019s head to know that the status of this person was definitely extraordinary. Moreover, anyone with even a little potential would be able to discover a dangerous aura radiating from him despite it not appearing as majestic as the two red-robed, old men. This aura was something the two red-robed, old men could not compare with\u2026</p><br/><p>The man wearing a purple-colored alchemist robes was young and handsome. However, there was a haughtiness that was difficult to hide under his handsome appearance. Of course, just by looking at the badge on his chest, no one would comment on his arrogance because he had the qualification to be this haughty.</p><br/><p>The badge was pale-blue in color and it vaguely appeared as though it was being burned by fire. The interior of the flame was a tower figure. Seven bright, purple-gold stars were shining around the tower, causing it to appear extremely glaring.</p><br/><p>Tier 7 alchemist!</p><br/><p>Moreover, it was an alchemist badge that was issued by the Pill Tower!</p><br/><p>This young man, who appeared to be less than thirty years old, was actually a tier 7 alchemist!</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Cao Dan, my Ye clan is indeed at fault for revoking the agreement back then. However, the Cao clan did not protest even a little before this, yet it has shown up with a fanfare now. May I know what you mean by this?\u201d Ye Zhong solemnly demanded. His expression was a little ugly as he studied this group of people, who had come will ill intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, Elder Ye Zhong must be joking. How can such a big event like marriage be treated as child\u2019s play? Your Ye clan took the initiative to mention it back then. How will you let my Cao clan account to the outside world now that you have suddenly retracted it?\u201d The young man wearing the purple-colored alchemist\u2019s robes faintly smiled. His hand was gently clenched and a wisp of flame jumped over the tip of his finger. He immediately glanced at Ye Zhong. \u201cCould it be that Elder Ye Zhong is purposefully playing with the Cao clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhong\u2019s expression changed upon hearing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cCao Dan, you better not try to twist your words to make up for you fallacious argument. Everyone knows of your Cao clan\u2019s wild ambition in wanting to swallow my Ye clan. You don\u2019t need to use such a matter as an excuse!\u201d The green-faced Xin Lan could not endure Cao Dan\u2019s overbearing manner, resulting in furiously crying out.</p><br/><p>The young man smiled at the pretty, green face of Xin Lan. He said, \u201cXin Lan, no matter how you put it, I am still considered your fianc\u00e9. It is really a little too unruly of you to scream at me. I will teach you some proper manners once you enter the Cao clan in the future\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Cao Dan, this marriage was only at an initial stage, where it is still being considered. No actual decision had been made. Therefore, my Ye clan has the right to revoke it.\u201d Ye Zhong\u2019s expression sank as he said, \u201cXin Lan will not marry into the Cao clan. We will treat this marriage as non-existent in the future. I hope that young master Cao Dan will not continue pestering us over this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Dan narrowed his eyes upon hearing Ye Zhong\u2019s words. He said with a faint smile, \u201cKe ke, the current Ye clan really does have some ability\u2026 do you really think that your Ye clan can regain the glory of back then after the big battle in Ye City? My Cao clan is not the Ice River Valley!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Dan\u2019s words contained an additional denseness to them when he finished speaking.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhong\u2019s face became green when he heard Cao Dan be this blunt. However, he did not dare to say anything to contradict him. The Cao clan had produced quite a number of outstanding alchemists. Its ability to gather people was even greater than the Ice River Valley\u2019s ability. Moreover, it had also helped some of the Dou Zun class super existences refine medicinal pills throughout the continent. With this favor, these people would likely not reject the request of the Cao clan. Should these people be gathered together, their might would indeed be at a level that even the Ice River Valley could not compare with.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*\u2026 Ye Zhong, there are somethings that cannot be retracted once said. Since you have mentioned it, the Cao clan will lose a great amount of face if it is retracted. Moreover, having a marriage with the Cao clan will also be quite beneficial to your Ye clan\u2026\u201d The gray-clothed, old man, who had not spoken since the beginning, finally raised his eyes and slowly said. \u201cToday, we have come on the order of the head of the Cao clan. We must bring the person with us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ye Zhong\u2019s expression changed upon hearing this. However, he was a little afraid when he looked at this gray-clothed, old man. He bitterly replied, \u201cEven Luo Yi zun-zhe has personally come. The Cao clan really thinks highly of my Ye clan\u2026 a marriage to the Cao clan might perhaps temporarily resolve our urgent problems, but this Ye clan would likely have to change its surname to Cao in the future. Therefore, I cannot abide by this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gray-clothed, old man shook his head. He slowly shifted his foot forward. After he took this step, a frightening aura immediately surged out of nowhere, like a large wave that had become hundreds of thousands of feet tall. It suddenly filled the hall, causing the faces of some of the weaker members of the Ye clan to immediately turn ashen.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>An elderly figure suddenly appeared in front of Ye Zhong\u2019s group when the aura of the gray-clothed, old man erupted. His foot stomped on the ground as an invisible ripple spread out from his foot in a lightning-like manner. At the same time, another vast and mighty aura spread, blocking the terrifying aura of the gray-clothed, old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the Cao clan is powerful, it really doesn\u2019t have the demeanor of a large clan by bullying others in this manner with its strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>The one who had suddenly appeared was naturally Tian Huo zun-zhe. His eyes were locked onto the gray-clothed, old man as he faintly chastised.</p><br/><p>\u201cDou Zun?\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden appearance of Tian Huo zun-zhe had caused the gray-clothed, old man to be slightly startled. He immediately narrowed his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, this junior is Cao Dan. The matter today is something between my Cao clan and the Ye clan. I hope that senior will not intervene. If you have any matter regarding pill refinement in the future, you might perhaps be able to find my Cao clan\u2026\u201d Cao Dan also slightly frowned before immediately cupping his hands together and speaking in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>He did not show any fear like an ordinary person would when facing a Dou Zun. With the great strength of the Cao clan, it did not lack some elite Dou Zuns who wanted to ask the elders of the clan to refine pills for them. Due to him having seen many of them, he no longer felt afraid\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cRefining pills?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe merely smiled when he heard this. He faintly replied, \u201cThat is not necessary. The old me naturally has a more suitable person to look for if I wish to refine a pill. Moreover, I have been tasked by him to guard the Ye clan. How can the old me not intervene?\u201d</p><br/><p>Cao Dan\u2019s expression slightly changed when he understood that Tian Huo zun-zhe did not give him any face. He immediately warned in a solemn voice, \u201cToday\u2019s matter is an order by the head of the clan. That person must leave with us. No one can stop us. Otherwise, that person will be an enemy of my Cao clan!\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of the members of the Ye clan became ugly upon hearing the words spoken by Cao Dan since they carried a threat.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, the Cao clan is really imposing. However, I am definitely protecting this person today!\u201d</p><br/><p>While the large hall had descended into silence, a faint, cold laugh suddenly sounded. It caused Ye Zhong, Xin Lan, and the others in the hall to be startled. A joy immediately surged onto their faces.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

By the time they had recovered, they only saw the white-clothed man on the ground. The hearts of everyone other than Feng Qing Er\u2019s four person group felt a chill. Their gazes contained an additional fear when looking at Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>The white-clothed man\u2019s body collapsed on an enormous rock. His body was covered with blood traces and was involuntarily twitching. The punch from Xiao Yan earlier might not have taken his life, but it had left him unable to move. With his strength as a seven star Dou Huang, it was impossible for him to forcefully endure a punch from Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes swept indifferently over this fellow. He slowly turned around and the coldness of his face swiftly melted. He grinned to everyone else and softly asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t there the right number of people now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qing Er\u2019s gaze swept over Xiao Yan\u2019s face. She coldly laughed, \u201cYou are extremely overbearing. It is likely that my Wind Lightning Pavilion cannot be compared with you when it comes to doing such things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan merely smiled in the face of the ridicule in Feng Qing Er\u2019s tone. He said, \u201cIt is merely the case of the weak being eaten. However, I don\u2019t understand how I can be more overbearing than the Wind Lightning Pavilion since it has maneuvered a couple of elite Dou Zongs to surround me. One can hardly find many who possess such generosity.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool wasn\u2019t about to appear, I would really like to test you to see just what level you are in this Heaven Eye Mountain. A place external help, can\u2019t reach.\u201d A cold glint flashed through Feng Qing Er\u2019s eyes as she challenged.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Miss Feng wishes to give it a try, she can do so anytime.\u201d Xiao Yan gave a bland laugh. His completely indifferent manner caused Feng Qing Er to be infuriated. However, she could only suppress the fury in her heart when she glanced at the mouth of the volcano. The Heaven Mountain Blood Pool was about to appear. She needed to quickly enter it and absorb the strange energy within it as quickly as possible. There was a limited amount of energy within the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. If she could absorb a little more of it, this little more might be able to decide whether or not she would break through the Dou Huang class\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan ignored Feng Qing Er after seeing that she had become quiet. He slowly walked to Nalan Yanran\u2019s side, and asked with a beaming look, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran was startled when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s smiling face. Suddenly, she felt the tip of her nose become watery. This feeling of being protected by a man seemed to be a different than the feeling Yun Yun gave her. It was solid and safe. Behind this skinny back, she seemed to be able to completely relax her heart.</p><br/><p>However, reasoning told her that this kind of calm enjoyment would only exist for a short while. Perhaps it would disappear after she left this Heaven Eye Mountain\u2026 the corner of Nalan Yanran\u2019s mouth was involuntarily lifted in self-mockery when she thought of this. At one point, she could have enjoyed such a feeling for her entire life. However, it was ultimately destroyed by her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this considered reaping what I sow?\u201d A soft, inaudible voice was gently emitted from Nalan Yanran\u2019s mouth. However, it coincidentally entered Xiao Yan\u2019s ears. His footsteps momentarily paused before he walked side by side with her to the top of the slope.</p><br/><p>The back of Nalan Yanran\u2019s teeth bit her lower red lip even harder when she sensed Xiao Yan walking by her. She slowly turned around and looked at the skinny back. When she was about to speak, however, a soul-stirring thunderous noise was suddenly transmitted from the sky.</p><br/><p>The thunder sound that suddenly appeared also stunned everyone present. They raised their heads, only to see the colorful energy tide in the sky suddenly ceased spreading. An enormous colorful spiral appeared on the mouth of the volcano. While it slowly spun, Xiao Yan and the others could sense an extremely frightening majestic energy that was wildly gathering in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the Blood Pool about to appear?\u201d</p><br/><p>Joy surfaced in the eyes of Xiao Yan\u2019s group when they saw this unusual change in the sky.</p><br/><p>Following the appearance of this enormous, colorful energy swirl in the sky, the energy around them began to fluctuate. Waves of energy poured into the swirl like colorful cloths, causing the spiraling speed to increase.</p><br/><p>A hurricane also appeared out of nowhere, following the increase in the rotation speed of the spiral. Whistling noises were rampant on the mountain top as the hurricane cut through the mountain peak like the edge of a knife. It left behind some arm thick cracks on some enormous rocks amid waves of \u2018chi chi\u2019 sounds.</p><br/><p>Powerful Dou Qi surged from the bodies of Xiao Yan\u2019s group. Their bodies were just like rocks that stood without moving on the tall slope. Most people who arrived here were considered to be the top people from the younger generation in the northern region of the Central Plains. There was naturally no weaklings among them.</p><br/><p>The energy spiral\u2019s size became larger in the sky, and the energy contained within it also became increasingly frightening. At a certain instant, the spinning speed was finally reduced. Immediately, the spiral paused momentarily before a glaring light suddenly erupted from the middle of the spiral!</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden intense light basically covered the entire Heaven Eye Mountain Range. At this moment, the dense fog that permeated the mountain range had become thinner amid this light!</p><br/><p>The energy spiral suddenly paused the instant the intense light appeared. Immediately, an energy pillar that was a hundreds of feet in size emitted a \u2018bang\u2019 like a cannonball. It blasted out of the spiral, its direction being the mouth of the volcano below.</p><br/><p>The expressions of Xiao Yan and the others changed slightly in the face of this frightening energy light pillar. Their bodies swiftly withdrew.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The light pillar\u2019s speed was extremely fast. Within a flash, it violently landed on the volcano\u2019s mouth. Immediately, an enormous air wave swept out and the surrounding strange rocks were immediately blasted apart.</p><br/><p>The feet of Xiao Yan and the others rubbed against the ground as they pulled back nearly ten plus meters. Only then did they slowly stabilize their bodies. They looked at the mountain top that had become empty in the blink of an eye, and involuntarily wiped off the cold sweat on their foreheads. Raising their eyes, they could see that the mouth of the volcano was permeated with a dense colorful light. A wave of powerful energy, which was astonishingly dense, was rippling within it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow is the best time to enter the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool, please get moving!\u201d Jin Shi\u2019s figure drifted over from a distant place before finally landing. There were two large Gold Swallowing Mice behind him.</p><br/><p>An excitement that was difficult to remove instantly flashed across the eyes of Feng Qing Er and the others when his words sounded. Their bodies moved and they swiftly unleashed their fastest speed, turning into a couple of light rays that flew toward the mouth of the volcano in a lightning-like manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan glanced at Feng Qing Er and the others, who were wildly charging over. His heart involuntarily laughed. After grabbing Nalan Yanran\u2019s wrist from behind him, his body moved and swiftly shot forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, do not go too deep into the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. You should quickly absorb the energy once you enter. This is an opportunity that is difficult to come by.\u201d Xiao Yan quickly reminded Nalan Yanran while he flashed forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Nalan Yanran did not oppose Xiao Yan pulling her. Instead, she gently nodded her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to wait for me after you have exited the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool. I might need quite a long time.\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s body moved and appeared on the mouth of the volcano. He randomly uttered some words as he did so. After which, his eyes swept at the mouth of the volcano and an amazement involuntarily surfaced.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the enormous mouth of the volcano was filled with a dense, colorful energy. It appeared exceptionally gorgeous. Moreover, the most attractive thing was the eye-catching red pool in the middle of the volcano.</p><br/><p>Even from a great distance, Xiao Yan\u2019s group was still able to see that the interior of the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool was filled with an unusual red liquid. Xiao Yan could sense that it was full of rich energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool?\u201d</p><br/><p>A heated look appeared in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes as he stared at the unusual Blood Pool. After which, he glanced at Feng Qing Er and the rest, who were wildly rushing toward the Blood Pool. His toes pressed on the ground, and he rushed toward the Heaven Mountain Blood Pool while pulling Nalan Yanran along.</p><br/><p>The size of this volcano\u2019s mouth was extremely large. However, Xiao Yan managed to cover the distance within half a minute with his speed. By the time he had hurried over, however, he coincidentally managed to see Feng Qing Er and the others charge into the Blood Pool, emitting a splashing sound as they did so.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan felt somewhat helpless when he saw these fellows being so anxious. However, it was fortunate that his target was the bottom of the Blood Pool. Otherwise, it would really be fun if he had competed with these people in terms of craziness.</p><br/><p>The Heaven Mountain Blood Pool was around seventy to eighty feet or so, and could not be considered too large. However, it was more than sufficient to accommodate Xiao Yan and the others. Looking at the Blood Pool from close up, Xiao Yan felt that the unusual feeling had become even denser. The red-colored energy did not appear to be much different than fresh blood. It was viscous and red. Some blood-like bubbles would also repeatedly appear on the surface of the Blood Pool. A wave of dense blood-colored energy was slowly being emitted like smoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed worthy of being a mysterious place that can aid one in breaking through the bottleneck. The shocking amount of energy gathered is at a level that I am seeing for the first time\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan sighed in his heart. He turned his head to Nalan Yanran and smiled as he said, \u201cYou should enter. Although you have not reached the peak of the Dou Huang class, soaking in it will still be beneficial to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran nodded slightly. She placed the white fox in her hands down gently beside the Blood Pool. After which, her pretty eyes paused on Xiao Yan\u2019s face while she whispered, \u201cThank you very much\u2026 you\u2026 if you wish to find teacher in the future, you can perhaps head to the Flower Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran did not wait for Xiao Yan to question her for more details after she spoke. Her body moved and she plunged into the Blood Pool like a mermaid.</p><br/><p>\u201cFlower Sect? One of the so-called two sects?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he saw Nalan Yanran\u2019s back disappear within the Blood Pool. However, he did not have the time to ponder about how Yun Yun managed to interact with such a faction. Nevertheless, he remembered this in his heart. His body leaped forward and landed into the Blood Pool with a smashing noise.</p><br/><p>The mouth of the volcano gradually became calm following the group\u2019s entrance into the Blood Pool. Only the wild wind continued to rage crazily, forming whistling storms in the process\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

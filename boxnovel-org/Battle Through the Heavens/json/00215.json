Her long white neck revealed a graceful angle and when one\u2019s gaze shifted lower, a standing, bountiful chest that was perfectly round, tender and lovely appeared. Perhaps it was because of the high temperature but a drop of a crystal water droplet appeared around her neck and began to roll down. It artfully drew across her full, round chest and finally formed a somewhat obscene angle as it dripped down.</p><br/><p>Her narrow waist seamed to be too small for a full embrace. However, a flexible feeling seeped out of its meager size. The flat and delicate lower abdomen did not have the slightest bit of excess flesh. With just a glance, it caused people to possess the impulse of extending their hands to roam around it.</p><br/><p>Under the narrow waist, there was a purple color snake tail that was filled with wildness. The snake tail swayed slightly, undoubtedly exposing a peculiar loveliness.</p><br/><p>Within the small bamboo forest, this lovely body which many men had salivated over was exposed in such a naked manner, allowing someone to feast over it.</p><br/><p>Amidst the bushes, Xiao Yan stared at the naked, lovely body that many men would go crazy over. In an instant, when he was not careful, a nefarious flame suddenly soared from his lower abdomen, turning his face bright red. It was a long while later before he clenched his fist, circulated his Dou Qi and suppressed the nefarious flame within his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis woman\u2026 isn\u2019t she far too scary?\u201d Xiao Yan once again raised his head. However, he only dared to stare at the soaring and burning \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 and did not have the courage to glance at the bewitching lovely body that was filled with temptation. He was afraid that if he were not careful, he might expose himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cQueen Medusa has an inborn bewitching ability. This kind of bewitching ability can be considered to be the most potent aphrodisiac for men. Of course, with her current strength, that bewitching ability has already reached the stage where she can fully control it. Uh, but when she is naked, that kind of bewitchment would also be released. Ah\u2026 be more careful boy. There\u2019s a knife above lust.\u201d Yao Lao spoke with deep meaning in his words.</p><br/><p>TL:  - (a knife above lust) meaning that lustful activities might lead to terrible consequences</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Hearing Yao Lao\u2019s sudden words, Xiao Yan could only smile dryly and nod his head in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, when do we take action?\u201d The surrounding temperature caused Xiao Yan to wipe off his perspiration as he asked in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a little longer. Although she has placed all her attention on the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 now, if she discovers your presence, she would definitely first finish off a small shrimp like you. I may be able to help you flee but the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we\u2019ll wait a little longer.\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Yan opened his mouth and closed his mouth before he became quiet once again. His gaze was entirely focused on the empty space a short distance away.</p><br/><p>Allowing the purple-colored gown to slide to the ground, Queen Medusa slowly took a step forward. Her beautiful eyes were blurry as they stared at the cluster of green-colored flame. Biting her red lips, she muttered, \u201cIf I were to follow the normal step by step method to train, I don\u2019t know when I will be able to touch the door toward a Dou Zong. This is the only path for me to quickly be promoted to the Dou Zong realm.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her delicate and narrow hands gently nestled onto her shoulders. She bent her waist slightly toward the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 in midair. She then slowly raised her head and watched the intense ripples occurring at the city wall. A cold glint flashed in her beautiful eyes. Her delicate fingers pulled aside the black hair on her forehead and blandly said, \u201cIf I successfully evolve, all the humans here today will stay in the desert forever!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying these icy words, Queen Medusa randomly pulled down the ribbon restricting her black hair. Instantly, her jet black, gentle hair showered downwards and gathered at her willow waist.</p><br/><p>She gently swung her head and the hair swayed carelessly. This random action increased the enchanting loveliness of Queen Medusa.</p><br/><p>Queen Medusa folded her hands together and closed her pretty eyes. Her hands repeatedly changed between strange seals. Following the change in the seals, the energy ripples in the bamboo forest suddenly became much more intense.</p><br/><p>Hiding within the bushes, Xiao Yan recognized this change and was immediately shocked. His body arched slightly, preparing to handle different kinds of sudden situations that could occur anytime.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is she trying to do?\u201d The ripples within the bamboo forest grew increasingly intense. Finally, it actually formed a huge energy vortex in the space above the sky. Seeing this change, Xiao Yan said with amazement in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 I am not too certain. The evolution of Queen Medusas is extremely mysterious. I have only heard about it; I\u2019ve never seen it\u2026 but it seems that the path for the evolution is not very precise\u2026 Ah, in other words, even if she succeeds, what she would evolve to\u2026 no one will know. This thing, appears to be random\u2026\u201d Yao Lao bitterly laughed. \u201cBut there is something that I am certain of. It will definitely be related to snakes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d Hearing Yao Lao\u2019s somewhat messy explanation, the speechless Xiao Yan shook his head. After giving up his intention of inquiring in detail, he focused intently on Queen Medusa who was covered by a rich glow.</p><br/><p>The glow continued to expand and contract. A moment later, a roar that was somewhat like a lion\u2019s and somewhat like a tiger\u2019s was loudly emitted from the glow. Not long after this roar was emitted, the eye-piercing glow suddenly swelled.</p><br/><p>Under this eye-piercing strong beam of light, Xiao Yan closed his eyes in instinct. A moment later, he once again opened them only to have his face filled with shock as he realized that there was a huge purple-colored snake over a hundred feet long suspended in the air above the small island.</p><br/><p>The huge purple-colored snake\u2019s body was long and strong. It also had a faintly elegant and aesthetic feeling. The pale purple-colored pupils were different from the vicious ones of the huge serpent Xiao Yan had met in the lake. Instead, it gave a feeling of serenity and of indifference.</p><br/><p>The huge purple-colored snake slowly turned its body around in midair. Its enormous head turned slightly toward the chaotic city wall. At this moment, a cold glint flashed across its pale purple eyes.</p><br/><p>At the side of the city wall, the black-robed person was suspended in midair. She indifferently glanced at the Hua She Er opposite her, who was in a terrible state. An instant later, it appeared as if she sensed something and suddenly turned her head around. Her gaze stared intently at the other corner of the city where the sky was filled with a purple light. The eyes under the black robe narrowed as she muttered softly, \u201cIs the evolution going to begin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou damn humans. Once Her Majesty succeeds in evolving, none of you will be able to escape!\u201d Hua She Er coldly said as she rubbed away the trace of blood at the corner of her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the evolution were to fail, we won\u2019t need to do anything. She would naturally disappear from this world.\u201d The threat from Hua She Er did not cause the black-robed person to feel any anger. It appeared that she was naturally born with such an indifferent character. There was seldom anything that could lead her to display any panic. This kind of person was like the white clouds in the sky. Although she appeared to be lazy and indifferent, she had the calmness and farsightedness that could oversee everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you know very well that this kind of evolution has no rules or methods. Even if she finally succeeds\u2026 no one knows just what kind of appearance she will evolve into.\u201d The black-robed person said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer Majesty will definitely succeed!\u201d Hua She Er\u2019s expression changed as she angrily cried with a tough exterior, but hidden behind that wall was a worried heart. Her feet stepped on the city wall and her Dou Qi flowed wildly as she charged over to the black-robed person.</p><br/><p>\u201cActually\u2026 I am also interested to see the final results of Queen Medusa\u2019s evolution.\u201d The black-robed person indifferently eyed Hua She Er who was angrily charging over. She smiled gently, shook her head and waved her hands. Over ten enormous green-colored wind blades that were over a hundred feet long targeted the floating Hua She Er and cut at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Queen Medusa\u2019s original body?\u201d Xiao Yan could not help but let out an involuntary cry as he gazed at the enormous purple snake in the sky with amazement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Snake-People race and humans are different. Not long after they are born, a secret technique is used to input the spirit of a snake-shaped Magic Beast into their body. As they grow older and their strength grows, this kind of spirit from a snake-shaped Magic Beast will gradually merge with them and eventually become one entity. After merging with a snake-shape spirit\u2026 when meeting a strong enemy, they will be able to summon forth an original form like this. When that happens, their strength rises tremendously. This is also the final card of the Snake-People.\u201d Yao Lao explained in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan nodded his head before raising it. His hand fondled his chin and muttered, \u201cShe\u2026 what does she intend to do? She won\u2019t swallow the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, would she? If it is swallowed by her\u2026 what will I do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis... \u201c Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s question, Yao Lao was a little sluggish. Immediately, he said helplessly, \u201cI\u2019m also not too sure. Actually\u2026 I don\u2019t think that she can successfully evolve. The destructive power of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is not something that can be joked with. Although she is a Dou Huang, it would still be very difficult for her to resist the power of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out a gentle sigh. He smiled bitterly and said, \u201cLet\u2019s just wait and see. If we were to rush out now, we might be incinerated by the wild \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 into nothingness.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, be more careful. If any problem occurs, prepare to flee at any moment. Both the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 and Queen Medusa are extremely dangerous beings\u2026\u201d Yao Lao reminded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded with a bitter smile and he increased his alertness significantly as told. His gaze stared intently at the huge purple snake in the sky without blinking.</p><br/><p>The enormous body lingered in midair. A rich purple-colored glow surged from its purple body and finally encompassed the entire shrine within it.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is setting up an energy enchantment. I think she is afraid of being disturbed by Gu He and others. Looks like this kind of evolution must have a quiet environment. She\u2019s rather unlucky to coincidentally meet this group of people today.\u201d Yao Lao said with a laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. But without them helping to stir up trouble, we would not have had the opportunity to enter\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. His gaze remained focused on what was occurring in midair. An instant later, his expression suddenly stiffened as he said seriously, \u201cShe\u2019s about to begin!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Xiao Yan\u2019s words fell, the enormous purple snake circled a few times in the sky before it suddenly let out a clear soft cry. After which, it charged toward the cluster of soaring green-colored flame without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis crazy woman\u2026 she actually dares to face the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 head on!\u201d Seeing the purple snake\u2019s action, Xiao Yan inhaled a cool breath and his body hurriedly pulled back.</p><br/><p>Under Xiao Yan\u2019s focused gaze, the enormous purple snake instantly soared down and without any hesitation, charged into the green-colored flame.</p><br/><p>The moment the purple snake entered the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, Queen Medusa unleashed loud shrills that would have numbed the skin of people\u2019s heads.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

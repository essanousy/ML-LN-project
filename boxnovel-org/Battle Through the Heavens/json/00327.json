He stood at the main entrance and watched the sky which was gradually becoming dark. His mind was a little blank as he did so. With the end of the Grand Meeting, his entire body had suddenly felt much more relaxed. Only without the pressure to absolutely take the champion spot could he truly sigh in relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this thing really consumes too much of one\u2019s spirit\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan laughed bitterly. If it were not for Queen Medusa saying that sentence back then, Xiao Yan would not be willing to desperately perform such tiring work and participate in this Grand Meeting.</p><br/><p>As he recalled Queen Medusa\u2019s warning, Xiao Yan\u2019s palm could not help but quietly touch the Seven Colored Heaven Swallowing Python that was twined around his arm while it was fast asleep. He did not know if it was because of Queen Medusa growing increasingly stronger, but the current python frequently descended into a deep slumber. Occasionally, while Xiao Yan was training, his keen senses would occasionally sense that there were two spirits which were suppressing and fighting with each other within that small body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, there\u2019s trouble everywhere\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan sighed softly. Without having the ability to help the Seven Colored Heaven Swallowing Python, Xiao Yan could only watch them fight. Although the final victor in this battle would definitely be Queen Medusa, the Seven Colored Heaven Swallowing Python at least helped Xiao Yan obtain the right to be able to discuss terms with Queen Medusa.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Queen Medusa had suddenly spoke the last time, it was likely that this \u2018Thawing Spirit Pill\u2019 was extremely important to her. Although the medicinal formula was currently already in his hands, she must still rely on Xiao Yan if she wanted to have the medicinal pill refined. Therefore, the current him need not worry about getting killed if Queen Medusa was to awaken one day.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a breath of somewhat cold, moist air. He threw those chaotic thoughts out of his mind and paused slightly on the street. After which, he lifted his head and walked in the direction where the Nalan clan was at. Today was the last time that he would need to expel the poison from Nalan Jie. If everything went smoothly, he would get his hands on the \u2018Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva\u2019 tonight. When that time came, he would try and see if he could awaken Yao Lao by using it...</p><br/><p>If he could wake Yao Lao up, he would have the safest protection on his journey to the Misty Cloud Sect this time around. If he failed to wake Yao Lao up, then\u2026 he could only toughen his skin and head up there. Since he had already come this far in his journey, Xiao Yan would not choose to give up regardless of what happened.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow will be the last idle day\u2026 if possible\u2026 ah, unfortunately, this thing also had some chances of a backlash occurring. Having successfully refined three lines on the medicinal pill, the backlash is much larger on a Dou Shi class\u2026 If my strength unluckily falls at this moment in time, it would really cause me to be depressed\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan pressed his lips slightly together. His finger gently rubbed his storage ring. Within it, there was the \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019 that had been refined for less than half a day.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan could not sense the actual strength of Nalan Yanran, it was likely that her strength would not be weaker than Mu Zhan from the sharp and imposing manner when she attacked the other night. She might even surpass him\u2026</p><br/><p>Mu Zhan was already a nine star Dou Shi. If Nalan Yanran surpassed him, then she should be around the Da Dou Shi class.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree years ago, she was merely a three star Dou Zhe. During this less than three year period of time she had actually advance to the Da Dou Shi class? Unless I have made a mistake in my judgement, it was likely that she consumed some sort of medicinal pill that could directly raise her strength during these three years. With the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s abundant wealth and the help of Pill-King Gu He, it was not impossible to refine such medicinal pills even though they are extremely rare. Otherwise, even if her talent was outstanding, it was impossible for her to become stronger so much faster than me\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan lowered his head and mused.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher\u2019s ability may be great and unfathomable, but those medicinal pills requires various rare medicinal ingredients in order to be refined. With my ability, there are many things that I cannot get my hands on. Without sufficient medicinal ingredients, Teacher would not be able to refine the medicinal pills regardless of how great his ability was\u2026 Therefore, he had been using and refining those catalytic type medicinal pill during these few years. For example, liquids that could stimulate the body\u2019s potential when applied on it despite bringing about extreme pain\u2026 However, Teacher had never made medicinal pills like those which could directly raise one\u2019s strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>Summarizing all of the conditions of the both of them, Xiao Yan quietly felt a little relief even though Nalan Yanran strength had improved by leaps and bounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we will see how it is when that time comes. If I can wake Teacher, I would not need to take the risk and consume that \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019. If I fail to wake him up\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan sighed before mumbling: \u201cThen I can only take the risk and give it a try. I have already prepared for three years just for this day. I cannot allow any blemishes which can result in my failure\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shook his head and temporary suppressed these somewhat irritating thoughts. He raised his head and glanced around. The Nalan clan\u2019s manor was already partially visible at the edge of his vision.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly came to the entrance of the Nalan clan. After coming over daily to help Nalan Jie expel the poison during these few days, Xiao Yan had already become a frequent guest in this place. Therefore, the two guards at the front entrance did not act in an inexperienced manner and step forward to stop him. Instead, they humbly smiled at him, raised their hands and respectfully led him in.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan followed the small gravel path and slowly walked for a distance. After which, he arrived at the hall only to see that Nalan Jie was already waiting for him. When Nalan Jie saw the former, he smiled as he stood up, cupped his hands together and said, \u201cCongratulations. The current you can be considered the man of the moment in the capital. There\u2019s no one who does not know you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and swept his gaze over his surroundings. However, he was a little surprised to discover that Nalan Yanran who had always been around was nowhere to be found.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, Nalan Yanran has returned to the sect. There was someone from the sect here today to urge her to return.\u201d Nalan Jie appeared to understand Xiao Yan\u2019s uncertainty as he explained with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d On the surface, Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. However, a cold smile appeared in his heart, \u201cThe Three Year Agreement is approaching. She naturally has to return\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandfather Nalan, let\u2019s begin today\u2019s poison extraction session. This is the last time. After tonight, the \u2018Searing Poison\u2019 will have completely left your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke. That\u2019s good. Thanks, young friend Yan Xiao. In the future, if there is anything that you need help with, you can just come to our Nalan clan. As long as I am in charge, I will definitely not reject you.\u201d Nalan Jie said with gratitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cEach of us is just getting what we need.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. He followed behind Nalan Jie as they walked into a room by the side. After which, they began this last poison expelling session...</p><br/><p>The last poison expelling session was so easy that it was a little beyond Xiao Yan\u2019s expectations. Of course, he clearly understood that this was because of his Spiritual Strength soaring during the Grand Meeting. Having experienced that kind of test, he had undoubtedly become much more capable in his control of the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan wiped off a drop of cold sweat from his face. His finger was removed from Nalan Jie\u2019s back as he eyed the latter\u2019s face which had suddenly become much more rosy. He nodded and said, \u201cCongratulations. The \u2018Searing Poison\u2019 has completely been removed from your body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said these words, Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth contained a little bitterness. The \u2018Searing Poison\u2019 had indeed left Nalan Jie\u2019s body, but it ended up running into his own body.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d Nalan Jie released a long breath of turbid air. The turbid air this time around no longer had the black colored content it did in the past. It really appeared to be as Xiao Yan had said. That \u2018Searing Poison\u2019 has indeed been completely removed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI cannot thank such great kindness with mere words or deeds. The old me knows that young friend Yan Xiao is here because of that \u2018Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva\u2019, but my life cannot be compared to that plant. I, Nalan Jie, promise you that if there is ever an opportunity in the future, I will not hesitate to repay your kindness!\u201d Nalan Jie stood up and spoke to Xiao Yan in a deep voice. From his manner, it appeared that he was extremely serious.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled but was non-committal.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Clap, clap*!\u201d Nalan Jie suddenly clapped his hands. A moment later, the room\u2019s door which was tightly shut, was pushed open. A female servant carried a jade flower pot which contained a plant as she walked in.</p><br/><p>When this plant appeared, a strange scent which calmed people\u2019s spirit immediately spread throughout the entire room.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sniffed the strange fragrance as his gaze instantly paused on the plant on her hand. This plant was completely green in color, appearing as if it was carved out from top quality green jade. On the top of the plant, a flower which possessed seven different colors was slowly blooming. As it did so, Xiao Yan was somewhat astonished to realize that the seven colors were actually gradually changing, giving it an extremely gorgeous appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung friend Yan Xiao, this is the \u2018Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva\u2019. It is said that if an alchemist were to use a flame to refine it into liquid, it would enable exhausted spirits to recover swiftly. Back then, I had spent quite a lot of effort in order to get hold of it. The reason for me getting that \u2018Searing Poison\u2019 was also because of picking this thing\u2026\u201d Nalan Jie laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan resisted the excitement in his heart and nodded slightly. He licked his lips and did not allow himself to get carried away.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, young friend Yan Xiao, since you have already completely cured me, this thing now belongs to you.\u201d Although Xiao Yan controlled himself very well, he could not deceive a cunning old fox like Nalan Jie as the latter smiled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much.\u201d Xiao Yan cupped his hands together gratefully at Nalan Jie. He did not resist any longer. Taking two steps forward, he received it from the female servant\u2019s hand. His gaze moved up and down as it watched the plant excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough this \u2018Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva\u2019 can be stored in the storage ring, you must let it receive an hour of sunlight everyday. Otherwise, it will automatically wither. You must remember this.\u201d Nalan Jie reminded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Yan nodded his head. Only then did he dare to store the \u2018Seven Magical Green Spirit Saliva\u2019 in his storage ring. He turned around and spoke to Nalan Jie: \u201cGrandfather Nalan, there are still some things that I am rushing to complete today. Since I have already finished what I need to do here, I will bid you farewell.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh? So soon?\u201d Nalan Jie was at a loss. He wanted to persuade Xiao Yan to stay, but seeing the urgentness on Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead, he could only swallow those words to retain him. With a smile, he said, \u201cIf there is anything you need help with in the future, you can come and find me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I will.\u201d As he smiled, Xiao Yan, who was in a hurry to wake Yao Lao, cupped his hands while facing Nalan Jie. After which, he turned around and hurriedly walked out of the room.</p><br/><p>Within the room, Nalan Jie watched Xiao Yan who was burning with impatience, and could only helplessly shake his head. He had planned to invite the other person for dinner to lay a solid foundation for their relationship.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

As long as they got rid of Gu He, they would be able to cause the Misty Cloud Sect to lose an enormous help.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will leave the matter of contacting the others to Old Hai. Additionally, please help me arrange for these people to have a good rest. They have not had a peaceful rest during this long journey from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019.\u201d Xiao Yan stood up and pointed at Lin Yan and the others as he smiled and spoke to Hai Bodong.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, this is something that we ought to do. Naturally, our Primer clan must receive such distinguished guests, that have arrived, properly.\u201d Old Hai smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled, turned his gaze toward Xiao Ding and suddenly said, \u201cI think that I should perhaps go and meet the clan members of the Xiao clan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is something that you ought to do. The First Elder instructed you to be the Clan Head just before he died. The clan members have waited two years for you to return\u2026\u201d Xiao Ding nodded his head slightly as he slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was silent. He immediately nodded his head quietly. No matter what, the blood of his clan flowed in his bones. Hence, letting this clan prosper was a responsibility that he could not push aside. Perhaps this was also his father\u2019s expectation\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and Xiao Li pushed Xiao Ding as they quietly snuck out the Primer clan\u2019s manor After which, they turned down a street within the capital, followed the road, and slowly headed in a certain direction.</p><br/><p>The great soul-stirring battle earlier was being heatedly discussed by the entire capital at this moment. Some of the people were so excited that they were dancing with flushed faces, bragging to the passersby about how they had watched the events from close proximity earlier. However, these people who were attracted by the dazzling battle did not discover that the main character of the story was quietly walking passed them.</p><br/><p>They pushed Xiao Ding and turned down a couple of different streets before the noisiness behind them gradually diminished. The number of luxurious houses around also diminished. Clearly, they were heading to a somewhat remote area of the city.</p><br/><p>They once again turned into an uneven street and a somewhat old and damaged compound appeared in front of Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. He could vaguely hear some of the children\u2019s laughter transmitted from the compound.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is here. In order to escape the search of the Misty Cloud Sect these years, we could only hide in such remote places despite the protection of the Primer clan.\u201d Xiao Ding smiled and said as he looked at the large compound.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly while Xiao Li quickly walked forward and pushed the door to the compound open.</p><br/><p>Some children were playing all around within the shabby compound. Laughter was repeatedly being emitted. At this moment, there were over ten ordinarily dressed men within the compound. These men were carrying weapons on their backs. They shifted their gazes and were extremely cautious. The life of a refugee these few years caused the members of the Xiao clan to cease having a kind of rich and relaxed aura. Instead there was an additional sharpness.</p><br/><p>The sudden opening of the compound\u2019s door also instantly attracted the attention of these men. Their faces immediately changed a little. Human figures flashed and grabbed the children running around and placed them behind. After which, they drew their shining weapons from their backs and aimed them at the exterior of the compound.</p><br/><p>Ha ha, there is no need to be anxious\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That familiar laugh caused all of them to relax just as everyone became anxious. After which, numerous gazes swept toward the three human figures at the entrance.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan pushed Xiao Ding and slowly entered this shabby compound. His gaze swept across the somewhat familiar faces. These people had some blood relationship with him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, look who has returned.\u201d Xiao Ding looked at everyone and laughed.</p><br/><p>All the clan members were stunned when they heard this. Their gazes immediately shifted to the black-robed, young man behind him. Everyone was startled when they saw that young face. It was some time later before a wave of wild joy suddenly erupted within the compound.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s young master Xiao Yan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is young master Xiao Yan. He is really back!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, there is finally hope for the Xiao clan. Quick, go and get the third Elder and the others!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan looked at the members of the Xiao clan who were actually somewhat at a loss because of the wild joy that had suddenly erupted. He exchanged gazes with Xiao Li by his side and a warm smile surfaced on their faces. After having been out roaming around and gaining experience for so many years, he had finally felt as though he had returned home upon reaching this place.</p><br/><p>The door to the house within the compound was hurriedly opened while everyone was crying out in wild joy. An old man immediately walked out with anxious footsteps. After which, his gaze swiftly locked onto the black-robed, young man in the compound. He looked at that familiar face and the third Elder, whose irritable character had been smoothened through these years, could not control his tears from flowing out. They had finally endured until this day.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Elder, you have suffered during these years\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan also sighed softly when he saw the third Elder\u2019s tear stricken face. He took a step forward and whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard, not hard. Young master must have suffered more than us after roaming outside for so many years.\u201d Third Elder rubbed his tears and replied.</p><br/><p>The surrounding members of the Xiao clan also could not control their eyes. They turned red when they saw the emotional third Elder. Although the Xiao clan was not considered some renowned and great clan back then, they still possessed quite a great position within the Wu Tan City. Unfortunately, within a short few years, the clan had swiftly declined. They, who originally had enough to live comfortably, had fled all over the place, always worried that the tragedy that happened one night would occur once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will let the Misty Cloud Sect pay back many times more than what they owe our Xiao clan.\u201d Xiao Yan gently patted the third Elder\u2019s shoulders and spoke in a soft, deep voice. His voice contained some fury and killing intent that was difficult to hide. He had a responsibility that he could not shake off for the Xiao Yan to end up in this manner!</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, little young master is really capable. The clan head really has an eye for people. He is much better than us three old men who won\u2019t die. Back then\u2026 ke ke, the first and second Elder had told me to apologize for our foolish actions toward the little young master back then just before they died\u2026\u201d The third Elder laughed but his voice was somewhat hoarse.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan pressed his lips tightly together. Xiao Yan could not help but feel his nose become somewhat sour in this solemn and desolate atmosphere. If his father were to return and saw that the Xiao clan had turned into this shape, it was likely that his father would be extremely disappointed in him, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cThird Elder, you should not mention those matters back then in the future. All of us possess the same blood. In the future, our aim should be to take revenge and revitalize the Xiao clan.\u201d Xiao Yan rubbed his nose and gently spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, we won\u2019t talk about it, we won\u2019t talk about it. According to the instruction that the first and second Elders gave before they died, little young master is the current head of the Xiao clan. Any clan member will obey your orders. The old me can help enforce the clan rules for anyone who refuses to accept them!\u201d The third Elder\u2019s gaze suddenly became stern when he spoke until this point. His voice was solemn.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that big brother is more suitable for this position of clan head\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan hurriedly spoke when he heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, you should not decline any longer. These are the last words of the first and second Elders and they cannot be changed. Moreover, only you have the ability to lead the Xiao clan to be prosperous once more.\u201d Xiao Ding shook his head and spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, third brother, you are the only one who can take the post of the Clan Head. Relax, big brother and I will help you.\u201d Xiao Li also laughed.</p><br/><p>Hearing the encouragement of these two and seeing the numerous earnest gazes from the surrounding clan members, Xiao Yan could only stop his pointless evasion and say, \u201cIn that case, I will take care of this position of the Clan Head of the Xiao clan for now. We will discuss about who is the most suitable in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding clan members immediately emitted waves of cheers when they saw Xiao Yan nod his head in agreement. They possessed an unknown confidence toward Xiao Yan. Moreover, with what they had noticed in the great battle in the sky earlier, they did not have the slightest doubt in the former\u2019s strength. They believed that under Xiao Yan\u2019s leadership, the Xiao clan would definitely become more powerful than it was in the past.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan pressed his hand on the illusionary air and suppressed the cheer. His eyes looked all around him as he asked, \u201cHow many clan members are currently left in the Xiao clan? What is their strength like?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are still two hundred and eight people. If we remove the women and children, who don\u2019t have any fighting abilities, we still have around one hundred and forty people. Most of them are of the Dou Zhe or Dou Shi class. Even I am only a four star Dou Ling\u2026\u201d The third Elder said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently sighed when he heard this. In the past, the Xiao clan did not possess powerful Qi Methods and Dou Techniques, nor did they have the help of any good medicinal pills. It was natural that their training was quite slow. This kind of strength was indeed not worth mentioning in front of the Misty Cloud Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place doesn\u2019t seem to have over two hundred people?\u201d Xiao Yan looked around him and wondered out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have secretly established a mercenary group that is used to earn some extra income and to help train the clan members. Hence, most of them are usually scattered about completing their tasks.\u201d The third Elder hurriedly replied.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He turned his head to Xiao Li and said, \u201cSecond brother, I will leave the training of the clan members to you. You can bring up any request to me. Moreover, change the living quarters to a better place. The Xiao clan will no longer need to hide and linger about to survive in the future\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, no problem. However, my training methods are not something that an ordinary person can endure. I wonder if anyone is afraid?\u201d Xiao Li nodded his head and immediately swept his gaze over the clan members as he spoke in a solemn manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung master Xiao Li, my son died by the hands of the Misty Cloud Sect. You tell me, what am I afraid of in order to gain strength? You can just train us to death. Those who die because they cannot endure it deserve it!\u201d Quite a number of those men with excited faces within the Xiao clan roared out in excitement once Xiao Li\u2019s words sounded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li nodded slightly. He felt quite satisfied with the guts of the members of the Xiao clan. One could train if one did not have strength. If one did not even have guts, one would just be a weakling no matter how one trained. Currently, the Xiao clan needed people who dared to stake their lives to fight and not some weaklings!</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother, you should also dispatch some members of \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 into the city. Currently, the Xiao clan does indeed need some protection.\u201d Xiao Yan mused for a moment before speaking to Xiao Li.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye, leave the matter of the Xiao clan to your big brother and I. What you need to do now is prepare to deal with the Misty Cloud Sect. This is the most important thing that we need to do. If we can defeat the Misty Cloud Sect, the reputation of the Xiao clan will surely soar. If we were to be defeated, we will really be beyond redemption.\u201d Xiao Li nodded, patted Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders and spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

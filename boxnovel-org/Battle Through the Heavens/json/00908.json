Their eyes were slightly shut. Between the four of them was, coincidentally, the deep hole that led into the magma world.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The soft sound of rushing wind suddenly appeared from the deep hole. The eyes of the four Elders suddenly opened at the same time. Immediately, their gazes focused on the deep hole, and the Dou Qi within their bodies involuntarily began to flow.</p><br/><p>During the time that the four Elders waited solemnly, a black figure suddenly flashed out before gently landing on the ground. The eyes of the four people drifted over. Only then did they softly sigh in relief. After which, they smiled and cupped their hands to that person.</p><br/><p>The one who had exited the deep hole was naturally Xiao Yan. He courteously smiled to four Elders. Su Qian also rushed out of the deep hole soon after Xiao Yan had exited from it. The four Elders sighed in relief when they saw this. They also knew the level of danger in the magma world below. Hence, they were afraid that Su Qian might have met with an accident within.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder, take out the \u2018Flame Gathering Pot\u2019 and try to see if it has any effect. There is no need to rush for this bit of time because of the matter of Han Feng.\u201d Xiao Yan looked at Su Qian who had landed steadily. He did not hurry to gather helpers. Instead, he gave a faint smile and gave a suggestion.</p><br/><p>Su Qian smiled and nodded when he heard this. He tossed his hand. The Flame Gathering Pot shot out of his Storage Ring and slowly landed in front of the four Elders. He smiled and said, \u201cAll of you practice fire affinity Qi Methods. Pour your Dou Qi into it and see just how much Heart Flame can be stimulated.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four Elders exchanged glances after looking at the Flame Gathering Pot in front of them. They did not hesitate much. The fingers of the four of them touched the body of the pot. After which, they shut their eyes slightly and powerful Dou Qi within their bodies flowed into the Flame Gathering Pot like floodwater.</p><br/><p>Four fire affinity Dou Qis of different shades poured into the Flame Gathering Pot like trickling streams. After which, the Dou Qi swirled slightly before charging into the Fallen Heart Flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following the entry of the Dou Qi, the infant Fallen Heart Flame\u2019s surface suddenly erupted and formed a wave of intense light. It appeared like a huge piece of rock thrown at the calm surface of a lake. Circular invisible ripples swiftly spread out from the Flame Gathering Pot\u2026</p><br/><p>These invisible waves curled and rose. Finally, they penetrated the tower one level at a time and encompassing the entire Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower within it.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the many students who were quietly training within the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower suddenly opened their eyes. Their hands involuntarily rubbed their chests. A wave of hot Heart Flame had suddenly appeared there. Some of the older students within the Inner Academy were not foreign to this Heart Flame because they had enjoyed the benefits of this kind of refinement before\u2026</p><br/><p>However, that benefit was lost ever since the Heart Flame of the Inner Academy was exhausted. Originally, they had thought they might not be able to enjoy that kind of treatment until they had graduated. Much to their joy, however, it had quietly returned\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower is able to produce a Heart Flame again!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the entire Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower experienced some initial surprise, the information of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower being revived was like a breeze that spread from the tower. It spread across the entire Inner Academy at a frightening speed. Within a short while, all of the students became jovial. The Inner Academy with the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower was the true Inner Academy.</p><br/><p>Even though Xiao Yan and the others were at the bottom of the tower, they were still able to hear the many cheers that were transmitted through the tower. Immediately, Xiao Yan exchanged glances with Su Qian and the two of them sighed in relief, appearing as though they had just released a heavy burden.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it is indeed effective\u2026\u201d Su Qian exclaimed. His gaze immediately slide to the four Elders and teased, \u201cLooks like we will have to trouble these Elders from our Inner Academy who practice fire affinity Dou Qi in the future. However, the speed at which this little thing absorbs Dou Qi is not very fast. Most of the Elders are able to endure it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The four Elders involuntarily and bitterly smiled. They shook their heads when they heard Su Qian\u2019s words. It was likely that they will forced to be a long term meal ticket for the Fallen Heart Flame within this \u2018Flame Gathering Pot\u2019...</p><br/><p>Su Qian laughed heartily when he saw the bitter faces of these four Elders. He waved his hand at Xiao Yan before walking to the exit. He spoke while walking, \u201cI will go and inform the other Elders who practice fire affinity Dou Qi. In the future, all of you might have to take turns and come here. Ke ke, just treat it as training. Only with depletion will there be growth. This also benefits all of you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>By the time Su Qian finished his words, he had already exited through the door. Xiao Yan behind him waved his hand pitifully at the four Elders and hurriedly followed. After all, he was also a practitioner of fire affinity Qi Method\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and Su Qian walked out of the bottom of the tower. Along the way, they sensed the atmosphere of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower had become fiery hot again and traffic soared. They let out smiles. The revival of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower was really a joy that had descended from the sky to these students. After all, with the Heart Flame to refine the Dou Qi within their bodies, their training speed would be able to increase\u2026</p><br/><p>After exiting the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower, Su Qian led Xiao Yan and hurried to the Elders Meeting Room in the deeper region of the Inner Academy. He had already dispatched an Elder to invite the Little Fairy Doctor and the others over for the issue of gathering helpers.</p><br/><p>By the time Xiao Yan and Su Qian arrived at the Meeting Room, the Little Fairy Doctor, Zi Yan, Xiao Li, and some of the experts from Xiao Gate were already seated within. The large group looked at Xiao Yan who had entered and some surprise was revealed in their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fellow, you have finally come out\u2026\u201d Xiao Li took the lead to stand up and say something too Xiao Yan with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan grinned and nodded to Xiao Li. After which, he found a seat beside the Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan. His gaze swept over these large and small beauties before teasingly saying, \u201cAfter not seeing you for a couple of months, it seems that the both of you have become even prettier.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi, don\u2019t think some nice words can eliminate the great sin of you tossing us aside to look for fun by yourself!\u201d Zi Yan curled her small mouth and sneered without giving Xiao Yan face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSin your head\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan was unable to laugh or cry as he shook his head. His hand rubbed the top of this little fellow\u2019s head. After which, his eyes found the Little Fairy Doctor who was smiling quietly. His voice was gentler as he said, \u201cHave you been alright during these few months?\u201d The matter that he was speaking about was naturally the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s \u2018Woeful Poison Body.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I am temporarily still able to suppress it.\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor pulled and parted a strand of snow-like hair from above her forehead as she softly spoke. Her grayish-purple moving eyes rotated to Xiao Yan. Surprise flashed across her eyes, \u201cYou have advanced again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s strength was even greater than First Elder Su Qian\u2019s. She was naturally able to see through the change in his aura.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*, if you want to engage in a private conversation, you can do so when you are free. Now, we should first discuss the important matters\u2026\u201d Xiao Li involuntarily and dryly coughed. He then started speaking when he saw Xiao Yan and the Little Fairy Doctor muttering to each other.</p><br/><p>The entire hall immediately emitte laughter when Xiao Li\u2019s words sounded. Xiao Yan was still alright, but a faint alluring blush surfaced on the pale face of the Little Fairy Doctor before she could stop it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there any activity on Han Feng\u2019s side now?\u201d Xiao Yan also withdrew his attention. His face was somewhat solemn as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fellow is extremely cunning. Originally, I had thought that he would have fled the \u2018Black-Corner Region.\u2019 It is unexpected that he would hide in the Demon Flame Valley\u2026\u201d Xiao Li knit his brows and said, \u201cThe Demon Flame Valley is an old faction within the \u2018Black-Corner Region.\u2019 Although their strength has been greatly reduced with the death of the Old Ground Demon Ghost, Fang Yan, and the other two Elders, they still cannot be underestimated. Han Feng has taken advantage of the Demon Flame Valley while they lacked a leader. He used his connections within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 and can be considered to have control of the Demon Flame Valley.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, according to my lastest information, Han Feng is quietly contacting some of the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 factions whom he had a good relationship with the intention of forming an alliance. Even that Black Emperor Sect, old man Ying Shan are all included in the invitation\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was stunned when he heard this. He immediately and coldly laughed, \u201cThis fellow is really a grasshopper who refuses to rest no matter what\u2026 he always wishes to create trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Han Feng is wildly ambitious. He had put in great pains to establish his old connections within the \u2018Black-Corner Region.\u2019 Although he was defeated by you a couple of times, he has currently reached the Dou Zong strength. His summoning ability within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 has not been reduced by even a little. If we were to really allow him to form an alliance with these factions within the \u2018Black-Corner Region,- it is likely that they will be a great threat to the Jia Nan Academy and Xiao Gate.\u201d Su Qian spoke in a deep voice, \u201cOn our side, we have only two genuine elite Dou Zong, namely the Little Fairy Doctor and I. The Elder Qian and Elder Bai within the Inner Academy will never act on this kind of matter. Their mission is to protect the Jia Nan Academy from being destroyed. Therefore\u2026 we will have to rely on ourselves for everything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHence\u2026 we must not allow the alliance with the other factions in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 to succeed! Otherwise, they would have the opportunity to turn things around.\u201d Xiao Li sinisterly continued.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan quietly nodded. His finger gently tapped the table. A moment later, he slowly asked, \u201cWhen will he invite these factions?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lowered his chin slightly. His body gently leaned on the backrest as he faintly said, \u201cSecond brother, maneuver all the experts from Xiao Gate. Additionally, dispatch someone to make contact with the factions that have a good relationship with Xiao Gate. Ask them to dispatch some experts. Tomorrow, all of us will head to the Demon Flame Valley. This time, I want to make sure that Han Feng will be unable to comeback!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Li nodded his head when he heard this. The corner of his mouth was parted into a savage smile as he said, \u201cThe Demon Flame Valley has a deep enmity with our Xiao Gate. This time around, we can eliminate them together and allow the other factions within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 to know that not anyone can offend our Xiao Gate!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Demon Flame Valley and the Jia Nan Academy\u2019s relationship is absolutely irreconcilable. This time around, the academy will dispatch all of its experts. We must completely eliminate them at their roots!\u201d</p><br/><p>A ruthlessness also flashed through Su Qian\u2019s eyes. Quite a number of the Jia Nan Academy students had been killed by the Demon Flame Valley during their outside training over the years. The relationship between both parties had long reached an unmendable stage.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. He slowly stood up and threw his gaze in the direction of the Demon Flame Valley. A dense smile surfaced on his young face.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything should come to an end\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

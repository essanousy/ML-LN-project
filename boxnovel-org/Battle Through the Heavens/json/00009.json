There are so many harsh requirements\u2026\u201d Suddenly, Xiao Yan\u2019s voice fell and he raised his head: \u201cI MET THE REQUIREMENTS?\u201d</p><br/><p>Enjoying the shocked yet excited expression that Xiao Yan showed, the elder stroked his beard slowly. After looking over Xiao Yan for a few more seconds, he finally said with some helplessness: \u201cEven though you barely make the cut, I owe you a favor. Hah, whatever, I\u2019ll let this count as the favor returned\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the reluctant elder, Xiao Yan thought that the geezer was lying about him barely making the cut, but he was too lazy to probe further. Despite his excitement, he still had his suspicions. \u201cEven if I make the cut, alchemists are taught by other alchemists. Are you an alchemist?\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the suspicious little face of Xiao Yan, the elder straightened and with pride he said, \u201cYup, I\u2019m an alchemist!\u201d</p><br/><p>Blinking his eyes, Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze at the elder became bright. Alchemists, those are really rare\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cMister, if you don\u2019t mind me asking, what rank alchemist were you before?\u201d Xiao Yan licked his lips and his young voice was infused with a hint of respect.</p><br/><p>In Dou Qi mainland, even though alchemists were very rare, there were still differences between alchemists. From low to high, the stages for alchemists range from the lowest, 1, to the highest, 9. The Pill King Gu He that made the Gathering Qi Powder that Nalan Yanran offered was a sixth stage alchemist and within the Jia Ma Empire, he could be considered to be the top alchemist!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat stage? Hehe, I don\u2019t remember \u2026 . Hey, kid, do you want to learn it or not?\u201d the elder impatiently asked while shaking his head.</p><br/><p>gravitytranslations.com</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I want to!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan didn\u2019t hesitate anymore and hurriedly nodded with his small head. Alchemists, even with forces as powerful as Faction of Misty Clouds, were treated with respect and deference.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, you want to? Since you want to, then you should pay your respects to your teachers.\u201d The elder sat on a green rock and coiled his legs beneath himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to pay my respects to my teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRidiculous! To not pay your respects and still expect me to teach you all that I know? You\u2019re dreaming!\u201d The elder rolled his eyes, looks like the pedantic elder really cared about these student-teacher relationships.</p><br/><p>Helpless with a dour face, Xiao Yan could only respectfully pay his respects to the elder to become an honorable alchemist.</p><br/><p>After watching Xiao Yan finish paying his respects, the elder finally nodded his head, satisfied. In his voice, a hint of intimacy appeared: \u201cMy name is Yao Lao. As for my origin, you don\u2019t need to know for now so that you don\u2019t get distracted. All you need to know is that the Pill King is \u2026 only trash in my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The edges of his mouth twitching, Xiao Yan watched the elder\u2019s carefree expression and thought: What is this geezer? The famous Pill King Gu He in Jia Ma Empire is only trash? If this spreads then the whole of Jia Ma would probably assume that he\u2019s mentally ill.</p><br/><p>Lightly taking in a breath and pushing down his shock, Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes darted around and with some droll he asked: \u201cUmm teacher, how will you help me to get to 7 Duan Qi within one year?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though for the past three years your Dou Qi has always been declining, your foundation in Dou Qi is much firmer than other people. In Dou Qi training, the foundation is the most important! Later, you\u2019ll be able to discover how many benefits these three years have brought you!\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s smile slowly disappeared and he took on a more serious expression.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was stunned, he was never told that having one\u2019s strength taken away would bring benefits.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen when are you going to teach me alchemy?\u201d Xiao Yan steered his thoughts onto the most important thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo become an alchemist, you need to have Dou Qi of the Fire-Attribute. So, before you become an alchemist you have to at least become a Dou Zhe and learn a fire attribute Dou Qi method!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan held out his hand and laughingly asked: \u201cFire attribute Dou Qi method? Hehe, teacher, since I\u2019m your student, you should give me a Tian Level fire attribute Dou Qi method, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Yan Lao indignantly scolded Xiao Yan: \u201cReally? Do you think that Tian Stage Dou Qi Methods are like potatoes in the ground? How could you say something like that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGeezer, since I\u2019ve already become your student, you can\u2019t possibly let me go into my clan to find Dou Qi methods, right? Our clan\u2019s top fire attribute Dou Qi method is only a high huang level. That\u2019s way too shabby for an alchemist!\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s face showed how depressed he was.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, I\u2019m your teacher, not a geezer!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s disrespectful words, Yao Lao rolled his eyes when he realized that Xiao Yan didn\u2019t care about being respectful to his elders.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Since you\u2019re my student, I wouldn\u2019t let you practice some shabby methods. Tian Stage Methods? I don\u2019t have them! But I have a method that\u2019s a lot stronger than a normal Tian Stage Method. Do you want to learn it?\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s turbid old eyes suddenly became conspiratorial.</p><br/><p>\u201cStronger than a Tian Stage Dou Qi Method?\u201d</p><br/><p>His heart beats rapidly. Xiao Yan swallowed some saliva and in his pitch black eyes, a hint of anticipation could be found. \u201cThen what level Dou Qi Method is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLow Huang Level.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s light laughter made Xiao Yan\u2019s face stiffen.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeezer, you were playing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>A furious voice sounded on the peak of the mountain.</p><br/><p>Looking at the twisted face of the young man, Yao Lao started laughing. To be able to make the calm Xiao Yan that mad, he had a feeling of accomplishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s strange about that Dou Qi Method?\u201d Watching Yao Lao\u00b4s bantering face, Xiao Yan suddenly calmed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can evolve!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes widened and without blinking, Xiao Yan stared at Yao Lao\u2019s face, trying to find a hint that Yao Lao was lying, but after a few seconds, he shook his head: \u201cNo way! I\u2019ve never heard of any Dou Qi method that can evolve!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuu, what do you know? Dou Qi mainland is huge and strange people and things happen all the time. In your limited mind, you haven\u2019t even gone outside of Jia Ma Empire. There are tons of impossible things that are actually possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan paused before saying: \u201cThen have you ever heard about Dou Qi Methods that can evolve?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s smile stiffened: \u201cBecause there aren\u2019t any other like it, this Dou Qi Method is unique!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can evolve?\u201d Looking at Yao Lao\u2019s serious face, Xiao Yan couldn\u2019t help but ask again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can evolve!\u201d Yao Lao seriously nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you tried it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 No.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave other people tried it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh\u2026 No.\u201d</p><br/><p>On Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead, a vein could be seen. With his hands curled tightly, Xiao Yan tried to resist his impulse to go over and punch the elder. \u201cIf no one else has ever tried it, then how do you know that it can evolve?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s explained like that on the Dou Qi Method.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere really are such Dou Qi Methods?\u201d His brows furrowed, Xiao Yan hesitated before saying: \u201cCan you let me see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe\u2026\u201d Looking at the curious Xiao Yan, Yao Lao\u2019s mouth opened, but what came out wasn\u2019t what Xiao Yan was expecting. \u201cNever mind. There\u2019s no use if you see it now so why don\u2019t you become a Dou Zhe first before I pass it on to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s outstretched hand paused and after the edge of his mouth twitched for a while, he spat out three words: \u201cYou\u2019re ruthless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Happily laughing, Yao Lao ignored the anger-filled pupils of Xiao Yan and said: \u201cOur current mission is to get your Dou Qi up to 7 Duan within 1 year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan pushed down his curiosity and anger for the Dou Qi Method and asked with clenched teeth, \u201cHow are you going to do that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao with a serious face said: \u201cWhen one begins to train their Dou Qi, their main focus is to build muscle and strengthen internal Qi paths so that they have a foundation for when they materialize their Dou Qi within their body. Because people at your age have weak internal Qi paths and can be molded, you need to take the training process step by step and you can\u2019t use outside force to boost your training speed or else in the future when your Dou Qi becomes stronger, your internal Qi paths won\u2019t be able to withstand the force of Dou Qi pushing through the paths and your Qi paths would burst which would be when you would die.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan knew this as well as Yao Lao because in the three years that he was crippled, his father was very worried and quite a few times, he tried to forcibly push Dou Qi into Xiao Yan\u2019s body, but every time, at the last second, he would stop so Xiao Yan knew the stakes involved.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao glanced at the calm Xiao Yan and satisfiedly nodded his head. \u201cBut that only applies to others. You\u2019re different. Your internal foundation was already solid and reliable three years ago and since then because of your firm personality, you never stopped training your Qi. Therefore, your foundation right now, I can say that it is great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you want to use outside forces to train my Qi? Like pills?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPretty much. But with the toughness of your Qi paths right now, you won\u2019t be able to take the force of any of the pills going through your Qi paths. Even the rudimentary Gathering Qi Powder, you wouldn\u2019t be able to use!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rudimentary Gathering Qi Powder\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan wanted to roll his eyes again. In Jia Ma Empire, a Gathering Qi Powder would fetch sky-high prices. But from his teacher, these Gathering Qi Powder became the most rudimentary things. The difference between the two left Xiao Yan stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen your plan?\u201d Taking a deep breath, Xiao Yan recovered and furrowed his brows again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, since pills are too fierce and can hurt your Qi paths, we need to use a milder method!\u201d Yao Lao smiles and says: \u201cTomorrow, prepare for me three complete stalks of Purple Leaved Bluegrass, where the older they are, the better. Also, I need two stalks of Bone Washing Flower, the age of it doesn\u2019t matter. Oh right, I\u2019ll also need a level 1 wood attributed monster core. These are all low-grade material so you should be able to get them\u2026 Someone\u2019s coming, I\u2019ll go back into the ring! Also, don\u2019t let anyone else know of my existence, including your closest family.\u201d After saying that, Yao Lao ignored the stunned Xiao Yan and jumped into the black ring. The ring shakes a bit and flies onto Xiao Yan\u2019s finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree stalks of Purple Leaved Bluegrass? Two stalks of Bone Washing Flower? A wood attribute monster core? Geezer, are you sure that\u2019s right? Do you think that I\u2019m some royal prince? These things, added altogether costs over a thousand gold coin! After a few years of saving money to the point where I would skip meals and never spend on luxury items, I only have 400 gold coins. That\u2019s only enough for one level 1 wood attribute monster core!\u201d Xiao Yan pointed at the motionless ring and cursed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s your own problem. Hehe, other people would lust after my nourishing fluids, but all I\u2019m asking is for you to get the money for the material and you\u2019re already crying about that\u2026\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s taunting laughter sounded within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn it! The things that alchemists make can only be afforded by rich people.\u201d Xiao Yan helplessly laughed. His allowance each month was only 20 gold coins. This was by no means a small amount; it would be enough for a small normal family to feed themselves for an entire year! But the money that he had was barely enough to buy one of the items that Yao Lao required. This is the difference between alchemists and other people!</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, looks like I have to borrow it from someone\u2026\u201d Sighing a depressed breath, Xiao Yan slowly regained his composure and his small face recovered to his normal calm face. Turning his head towards the path up the mountain, he could make out a purple figure climbing the mountain like a spirit.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

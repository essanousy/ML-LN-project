They looked at each other with no understanding of what was happening.</p><br/><p>The fortress erupted into an earth-shaking cheer during the time that they were stunned. A countless number of people, who had originally thought that their country and home would be destroyed today, could not control the excitement in their hearts. A cheer from having survived charged to the clouds.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that the three empire alliance has finally withdrawn\u2026\u201d Hai Bodong let out a long sigh as he spoke in a manner that suggested he had removed a heavy burden.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how Xiao Yan managed to convince the sect leader of the Poison Sect. That woman doesn\u2019t appear to be a reasonable person.\u201d Jia Xing Tian smacked his mouth and wondered. However, his face still contained a joy that was difficult to hide. They clearly understood that the enormous strength of the three sect alliance still left their side at a disadvantage. This would still be the case even if Xiao Yan and Medusa were around.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter what, this big battle that has lasted for one year has finally ended. The Jia Ma Empire will remain.\u201d Xiao Ding rubbed his forehead and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, hee hee\u2026 hee hee\u2026 however, after today, the Yan Alliance\u2019s and the Jia Ma Empire\u2019s reputation can be considered to have spread. Fighting three large sects with one alliance. This feat is enough to allow our Yan Alliance to cause those fellows who mocked us to look at us differently when we participate in the North-Western Region Factions Grand Meeting.\u201d Hai Bodong smiled as he spoke. It should be known that even when the Misty Cloud Sect from the Jia Ma Empire went to participate in the South-Western Region Factions Grand Meeting, they were mocked by quite a number of groups. After all, in the eyes of these factions with frightening strength, the Misty Cloud Sect, which did not even possess a single elite Dou Zong, had difficulty possessing the qualifications to sit with them.</p><br/><p>Jia Xing Tian and Fa Ma smiled and nodded when they heard this. The Jia Ma Empire would likely stand proud that day.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan, who heard the earth-shaking cheer from the fortress in the sky, also sighed in relief. He turned his head and smiled as he said to Medusa, \u201cIt has been tough on you this one year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is unexpected that you have so many old friends that you can meet all over the place.\u201d Medusa faintly replied. Her words were tainted with a slight sourness that was difficult to describe.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan could only bitterly laugh when he heard these words of hers. He said, \u201cShe is merely a friend from back then. It is just that I did not expect her to end up on today\u2019s stage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe should be the person whom we had met in the \u2018Magical Beast Mountain Range\u2019 back then, right? I faintly sensed it when we exchanged blows during this period of time.\u201d Medusa glanced at him as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. His eyes slinked toward the fortress and he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. This big battle is over and the Jia Ma Empire can finally catch its breath.\u201d His body moved after he said these words. He took the lead to fly to the fortress. Medusa followed close behind him.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>The joyful news swiftly spread throughout the entire Jia Ma Empire when the big battle was over. In a short while, every single place began to sweep away the despair and darkness of the past. Being able to not leave their country was naturally the hope of many people. A vagrant life was something that no one was willing to taste even once for no reason.</p><br/><p>In this big battle, Xiao Yan and Medusa\u2019s names were naturally transmitted to the ears of every single person. With the help of this, the reputation of the Yan Alliance once again soared. Many people or small factions who had joined the Yan Alliance were very proud. They were also more confident when they spoke to others.</p><br/><p>During the time the outside world was filled with a joy, Hai Bodong and the others, who had remained in battle for a long time, finally sat down to rest. They need no worry about whether the three army alliance would appear in the next moment.</p><br/><p>There were not many people in the hall. However, those present were the core members of the Yan Alliance.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sat in the leader\u2019s seat, which had gone unoccupied for a long time. His eyes looked over the entire hall. He chose to randomly chat for awhile before turning his head to Hai Bodong and inquiring in a solemn manner, \u201cNo one from the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 has appeared during the past year, right? The thing that Xiao Yan paid the most attention to was naturally the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019. The reason that he had established the Yan Alliance was to use it to enable him to protect the Xiao clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hai Bodong nodded his head and said, \u201cFor some unknown reason, news regarding the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 has ceased coming from the empire ever since the Misty Cloud Sect was disbanded.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief when he heard this. He immediately fell into a deep thought. The \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 was clearly extremely interested in the \u2018Tou She Ancient God\u2019s Jade\u2019 belonging to the Xiao clan. Hence, it was unlikely that they would simply give up. It had been almost a year but why was there no other activity? Was it because some other matter had resulted in them not having the time to bother with them?</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan mused for a moment in his heart, but it was futile. He could only shake his head, raise it, and sweep his eyes over Hai Bodong. He involuntarily said with a smile, \u201cIt is unexpected that old Hai has also reached the peak of the Dou Huang class. I think that you should be able to reach the Dou Zong class soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hai Bodong immediately shook his head in a helpless manner when he heard this. He said, \u201cYou little fellow\u2026 how can it be so easy? Do you not see that Old Jia has remained at this stage for many years and has never broken through.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. His eyes turned to the smiling Xiao Ding by his side as he asked, \u201cBig brother, what is the Yan Alliance like now? Is it alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have basically extended to most of the corners of the Jia Ma Empire. Currently, almost every single large and middle-sized city has the presence of our Yan Alliance. Moreover, the Yan Alliance has also branched into a countless number of industries during this one year and has become extremely complicated.\u201d Xiao Yan laughed. \u201cThe current Yan Alliance can be said to be even bigger than the Misty Cloud Sect back them. After all, they did not have as many branches as we do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter this one year of recruitment, the Yan Alliance should have around forty expert Dou Wangs. There are fewer Dou Huangs with us only having less than ten. Moreover, the Yan Alliance has also established a \u2018Yan Pulse\u2019 training organization. The people who were able to enter this group to train have all been carefully selected, and are all outstanding people. In the future, they will be our alliance\u2019s newest blood.\u201d Xiao Ding laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, the Yan Alliance also has a business hall, which consists mostly of clans like the Primer clan. There is also a medicinal hall established from the many alchemists from the Alchemist Association. They provided our Yan Alliance with an unceasing amount of medicinal pills. Ke ke, the reason why we are able to drag this big fight out for so long is partly because of their effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan finally understood the Yan Alliance\u2019s current strength and size within the Jia Ma Empire after hearing the brief summary. He could not help but smack his mouth. Although he had confidence in it when it was established back then, he did not expect that big brother and the others would be able to develop the Yan Alliance until such a stage within a short one year. From what his big brother had said, the size of the current Yan Alliance seemed to have far exceeded the \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. Of course, the \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 there had great potential. This was because it was provided with the graduates of extraordinary talent from the Inner Academy. These people were all people who had outstanding training talent.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre the members of the Xiao clan well?\u201d Xiao Yan softly inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can they not be well with an outstanding clan head like you?\u201d Xiao Ding spoke with a smile. The Xiao clan has justifiably become the strongest clan within the Jia Ma Empire. It was for no other reason other than the Xiao clan had produced this leader of the Yan Alliance, Xiao Yan!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan softly exhaled as he said, \u201cIf you have the time, you should send someone to pass the message to the Jia Nan Academy. If Xiao Yu and the others wish to return, let them do so. The current Xiao clan already possesses the ability to protect itself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Ding nodded. He said, \u201cCoincidentally, I can also pass the message to the \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 and tell second brother that he need not hurry over to rescue us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He immediately waved his hand and said, \u201cSince the big fight is over. I will leave the remaining matters to all of you. I am very reassured if I hand this Yan Alliance over to all of you.\u201d Xiao Yan walked out of the hall in front of the numerous helpless eyes after saying this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow is thinking of being an absent leader again\u2026\u201d Everyone in the large hall softly grumbled.</p><br/><p>The Black Mountain Fortress under the night sky might still appear like a vicious beast lying on the ground because of its enormous size, but it gave off a less fierce aura compared to daytime and a little more silence.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was seated cross-legged on a low mountain peak not far from the fortress. His eyes were slightly shut as the moonlight landed on his body. The faint cool feeling caused Xiao Yan\u2019s heart to feel extremely clear.</p><br/><p>Medusa lazily leaned on a tree trunk behind Xiao Yan. She blinked her bewitching pupils as she repeatedly swept them back and forth. A moment later, she lazily said, \u201cShe is still not here even at such a late hour. Looks like you have waited in vain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head when he heard these words. He spoke without turning his head, \u201cI have already told you that there is no need for you to come. Are you afraid that she will actually eat me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho knows whether she is really retreating or faking a retreat. If she uses this one-on-one meeting to kill you and return once again tomorrow, the Jia Ma Empire would be finished.\u201d Medusa curled her mouth as she replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled when he heard this. His heart immediately moved as he turned his head and looked at the distant sky. Ripples were being transmitted from the sky from that direction. A white-colored figure stepped on the empty sky, appearing to be walking over slowly. However, the figure appeared in the air above this mountain peak within just a couple of blinks.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Myriads of curious glances unceasingly swept over that black cloaked man but upon hearing the elder say that he was an alchemist, their eyes suddenly became filled with ardor\u2026 and full of worship. No matter where, alchemists were the ones that had the most respected profession in the eyes of others.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister, this person, isn\u2019t he the mysterious alchemist we saw during the auction the other day?\u201d Xiao Ning\u2019s two eyes fixed on this man dressed in a black cloak as he tugged at Xiao Yu\u2019s sleeve, eagerly asking her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d Xiao Yu slowly nodded; her beautiful eyes were still staring at this silhouette covered by a black mantle, as her lovely face showed a slight expression of pleasant surprise: \u201cI didn\u2019t think that this honorable sir would really come to our Xiao clan; it looks like what he said last time about cooperating with us wasn\u2019t just lip service\u2026 If we really obtain his help, the Xiao clan should be able to go through this predicament with ease. \u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the whispers from the people around her, Xun Er wrinkled her brows and fixed her crystal clear eyes tightly at the stocky man in the black mantle. She didn\u2019t know why, but she felt that the man\u2019s gestures, his speech and his manners were not exactly harmonious.</p><br/><p>After knitting her brows while pondering for a long time, Xun Er could only helplessly renounce this idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, sir; what brings you here?\u201d Personally preparing a cup of tea, Xiao Yan asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was passing in the neighborhood, so I thought I\u2019d come to visit your noble clan. I brought with me a few Foundation Elixirs that should be able to foster a good amount of youths from your side.\u201d Under this black gown, the elder\u2019s voice was quite joyous.</p><br/><p>Having heard him, Xiao Zhan hurried to look around but didn\u2019t see the faintest trace of Xiao Yan. He couldn\u2019t help but bitterly smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, the Xiao family head doesn\u2019t need to call him out, I have already met the young master, a quite fine youth, he\u2019s quite to this old man\u2019s liking...\u201d Waving his hands, he stopped Xiao Zhan from calling someone to get Xiao Yan. The tone of the black cloaked man was filled with a touch of admiration that he didn\u2019t conceal and made the youth hidden under the cloak quite embarrassed.</p><br/><p>Hearing the black cloaked man\u2019s tone filled with admiration, the eyes of everyone in the hall were filled with envy. To get such a high evaluation from such an high level alchemist wasn\u2019t something that was easy to come by.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll the good stuff happens only to this brat.\u201d As he\u00a0twitched his\u00a0mouth, full of unwillingness, Xiao Ning's\u00a0tone was full of envy.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yu, completely helpless, sighed, her jade-like hands on her cheeks, she silently whispered: \u201cIs that brat so good? How come I never realized it before?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the compliment, Xiao Zhan\u2019s face revealed a huge smile and in his eyes, a glimpse of pride could faintly be seen.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao clan leader, I recently heard that your clan was facing hardships, right?\u201d Xiao Zhan\u2019s smile hadn\u2019t stretched out completely before it was struck down by the oppressive voice of Yao Lao.</p><br/><p>Nodding in agreement, Xiao Zhan smiled bitterly, \u201cSurely this sir knows our Xiao clan\u2019s current situation, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMhh, I know a bit about it.\u201d Nodding, the black cloaked man revealed a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, in the current Xiao Clan, our business is already no more than half than what it was in the past. In the long term, I\u2019m afraid that our influence is also going to sink down to that of a second-rate clan.\u201d Xiao Zhan sighed in regret, wrinkling his brows. He seemed to age a few years at that particular moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Even though I am not so close with Xiao Clan, I am getting along quite well with your son. If you, Xiao Clan leader, are not afraid that this old man may have some bad intentions, how about cooperating together? \u201d The black cloaked man smiled gently.</p><br/><p>Having heard him, Xiao Zhan was startled at first but soon became wildly joyful; that was all he was what he was waiting for\u2026 He gave a look full of excitement to the three elders and soon after, nodded without the slightest hesitation: \u201cSir, we want to cooperate with you; we\u2019d love to in fact.\u201d</p><br/><p>The assistance of an alchemist above the second tier was something that Xiao Clan could not even dream of. Xiao Zhan didn\u2019t think that his own clan had something that could interest a second tier alchemist and hearing the alchemist\u2019s words, that he would cooperate with the Xiao Clan, Xiao Zhan deduced that the reason of the alchemist helping should be because of Xiao Yan. With such an opportunity, Xiao Zhan would be fighting to get the chance.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Zhan\u2019s approval, the black cloaked man nodded and a white palm appeared from the cloak. On his finger was a red-colored ring and with a flick, it immediately flickered in red light...</p><br/><p>Staring at his palm, as white as a youth\u2019s, Xiao Zhan was shocked. The palm gave him a\u2026 familiar feeling.</p><br/><p>But Xiao Zhan didn\u2019t have the time to ponder about the cause of his sensation of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu; immediately, a pile of jade bottles appeared on the table.</p><br/><p>The huge table was, in a blink of eye, entirely covered with little jade bottles; there wasn\u2019t a single place left empty.</p><br/><p>Staring at these jade bottles that appeared out of thin air inside this big hall, except from the green clad lady that was near the window, all the other clansmen, without the slightest exception, were shocked by this tremendous amount of pills to the point that they could hardly breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere are 1283 bottles of the healing medicine, \u201cBlood Clotting Powder\u201d. It isn\u2019t the best healing drug in terms of quality but compared to the Jia Lie Clan\u2019s \u201cReturn Spring Powder\u201d, its effects are lot more outstanding.\u201d Watching the stunned people in the hall, the black cloaked person carelessly introduced his \u201cmerchandise\u201d.</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhan, shocked with mouth wide open, took a deep breath of the surrounding ice-cold air, \u201cThis is truly a big business!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

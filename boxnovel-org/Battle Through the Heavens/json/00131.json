Even though Xiao Yan was far from where the battle took place, his ears started to feel uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan focused intently at the far skyline where green and red seemed to fill the air. The lazy white clouds were also no exception as they were dyed a shade of the two colors.</p><br/><p>Another thunderous roar blasted into Xiao Yan\u2019s ears, causing him to swallow hard. The pressure from the energy in the sky actually caused his legs to shiver.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this a fight between the strong?\u201d Xiao Yan mumbled in his mouth. This was the first time that he had witnessed the terrifying power from a battle of this level. He felt that the him of the past was but a frog in a well. Only now did he finally understand that the records in the books that described one person handling ten thousand opponents were not simply legends.</p><br/><p>Standing beside Xiao Yan, Yao Lao pressed his eyebrows together and watched the distant battle that occurred at the skyline and muttered to himself, \u201cThat female should be a human. Why did she run all the way to the Magic Beast Mountain Range and fight with the Amethyst Winged Lion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Do you feel shocked?\u201d Yao Lao suddenly asked with a smile when he tilted his head and noticed the shivering Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Nodding his head with great difficulty, Xiao Yan smiled bitterly. \u201cOnly after witnessing their battle do I understand that the fights that I have been involved in were insignificant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I\u2019ve already said that the Dou Qi continent is very big. There are even a number of people stronger than a Dou Huang practitioner. You have the potential. When you finally step onto that level, you will naturally come to realize that this world is very exciting.\u201d Yao Lao laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough the power that used created in these battle is very scary, I will not be overtly ambitious. The journey should be taken one step at a time.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled brilliantly.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Yao Lao was momentarily stunned but he quickly gave a pleased smile and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to go over and have a look at their fight?\u201d Lifting his chin to the far away fight, Yao Lao asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey won\u2019t discover us, will they?\u201d Xiao Yan initial joy was quickly overshadowed by his concern as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you looking down on me?\u201d Yao Lao waved his hand, transforming his body into a flowing light and entered Xiao Yan\u2019s body. Immediately, a dense white energy warped around Xiao Yan. \u201cI\u2019ll be controlling your body during this period of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he said this sentence, the Ziyun Wings on Xiao Yan\u2019s back automatically extended outwards. The Ziyun Wings this time around were not only over a meter long but had a purple colored light flowing on its surface, appearing both vivid and mysterious.</p><br/><p>The dense white energy slowly encompassed the purple light of the wings, hiding the glaring bright light.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Today, I\u2019ll bring you to see what is called a truly strong person!\u201d Yao Lao smiled faintly as he flapped the Ziyun Wings, slowly lifting Xiao Yan\u2019s body into the air. The pair of wings flapped again, sending Xiao Yan shooting at a low altitude towards the battleground.</p><br/><p>Seeing the blurry images of the trees retreating under him, Xiao Yan was so excited that his face appeared to be a little red. With the help of the Ziyun Wings, Yao Lao\u2019s current speed was much faster than what it was back at Wu Tan City. The pleasure of flying at great speed gave Xiao Yan an impulse to face the sky and shout.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan flew at an extreme speed along the canopy of the woods and after ten minutes, finally closed in on the fight. The pressure that was transmitted from the overwhelming waves of energy caused Xiao Yan\u2019s heart to tremble despite being under the protection of Yao Lao.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan finally came to a stop less than a hundred meters away from the battle in the sky. Xiao Yan used the cover of the large forest and landed on top of an enormous tree. Here, Xiao Yan could clearly see the pair who were fighting in the sky.</p><br/><p>Watching from a close distance, Xiao Yan once again experienced the fierceness and toughness of a Dou Huang. In the blue sky above, the green and red color enveloped almost half of the entire skyline, giving birth to a spectacular picture.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze first swept over the enormous Magic Beast in the sky. The Magic Beast had a gigantic body that was seven or eight meters long. The surface of its body was covered by a layer of purple colored crystal, which reflected the sunlight and shone it in all directions.</p><br/><p>The Magic Beast\u2019s head was an ominous looking lion\u2019s head with a pair of bloody red beast eyes that carried a strange glint of purplish light and a large mouth covered with fangs. At the top of the beast head was a fiery red helix shaped horn with a cluster of purple colored flame clustered around it. A pair of purple colored wings grew from the back of the lion\u2019s body. When it flapped, numerous small clusters of flame were swept in all directions, much like a flamethrower. Its four rough and strong claws were similarly covered with a layer of purple crystal. Each time they stepped down, they would cause the empty air to shake, displaying a great strength that was difficult to imagine.</p><br/><p>The huge Magic Beast stood in the air while a shapeless pressure descended from the sky, causing Xiao Yan\u2019s spirit to tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt this the legendary Amethyst Winged Lion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan mumbled softly as he obscurely watched the Magic Beast which displayed both beauty and destruction.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shook his head due to the amazement he felt for the Amethyst Winged Lion. He then shifted his gaze onto the one who had challenged the Amethyst Winged Lion.</p><br/><p>\u201cA female?\u201d When Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze first swept across the well proportioned and exquisite body, he was startled. He did not expect that the strong person who dared fight with the Amethyst Winged Lion was actually a woman.</p><br/><p>The lady in the sky was wearing a tight dress that covered her exquisite frame while wielding a strange looking longsword that was emitting a green colored light. Her black hair was held in place by a noble looking phoenix accessory. The beautiful and moving face of hers was very calm, revealing not the slightest change even when faced with a Magic Beast that was extremely well known in the Dou Qi continent.</p><br/><p>On the mysterious woman\u2019s back was a pair of green colored wings that appeared slightly illusionary. Those were likely formed from the amalgamation of her Dou Qi. The transformation of Dou Qi into wings was a symbol of those who were Dou Wang or stronger.</p><br/><p>The mysterious woman lightly stood in the sky. Her calm and beautiful face carried a gracefulness and nobility that the simple dress she wore could not hide.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman woman, why did you come and disturb my rest?\u201d The huge Amethyst Winged Lion in the sky suddenly roared using the human\u2019s language.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing that the Magic Beast spoke the human language, Xiao Yan was initially shocked but quickly realized something. After reaching this rank, the Magic Beasts had long achieved consciousness and possessed an intelligence that would not lose to a human.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish to borrow your highness\u2019 Purple Spirit Crystal.\u201d The mysterious woman parted her red lips as her beautiful eyes stared at the Amethyst Winged Lion. Her faint voice was clear and moving.</p><br/><p>\u201cPurple Spirit Crystal? I can only drop a small piece every twenty years. Who are you to ask for it?\u201d The Amethyst Winged Lion mockingly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can exchange for it with something that you need.\u201d The mysterious woman seemed also slightly afraid of this rank six Magic Beast that was well known for its fierceness. Thus she was not forceful when she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cExchange? Ha, alright. It so happens that I am now in the body transformation stage. If you can get me a \u2018Body Transformation Pill\u2019, I will give you a Purple Spirit Crystal. What do you say?\u201d The Amethyst Winged Lion howled when it heard the woman\u2019s suggestion.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo actually ask for so much. The \u2018Body Transformation Pill\u2019 is a rare pill that requires a tier seven alchemist to successfully refine. Using it to exchange for a Purple Spirit Crystal? Unless that woman is an idiot.\u201d Hearing the demand of the Amethyst Winged Lion, Yao Lao laughed with his old voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan blinked his eyes. Having heard of this pill for the first time, he curiously asked, \u201cFrom its name, it seems like this \u2018Body Transformation Pill\u2019 is used to help the Magic Beast transform its body, right? Why? Is it very valuable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the \u2018Body Transformation Pill\u2019, a Magic Beast would be able to completely transform into the human shape. Once they achieved this transformation, their training speed would become comparable with that of a human. Do you think that this thing isn\u2019t valuable?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan nodded his head speechlessly. The lifespan of a Magic Beast was much longer than a human\u2019s. Although there were some strange pills that could extend one\u2019s lifespan but when compared with a Magic Beast, especially those of higher ranks, the lifespan of a human was really short. Just imagining a high ranked Magic Beast that had successfully transformed and trained continuously for a hundred or eighty years would be a creepy thought.</p><br/><p>As Yao Lao had expected, the mysterious woman frowned and shook her head upon hearing the Amethyst Winged Lion\u2019s demand. With a soft voice, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, There are only a few people in the Jia Ma Empire who possess something like a \u2018Body Transformation Pill\u2019. But if you are willing, I can use three rank five Monster Cores and a High Xuan Qi Method and Dou Technique that you can train with to exchange with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot interested. If you cannot produce the \u2018Body Transformation Pill\u2019 then you should leave the Magic Beast Mountain Range.\u201d The Amethyst Winged Lion shook its large head, not hesitating to reject the mysterious woman\u2019s terms.</p><br/><p>Letting out a soft sigh, the mysterious woman slowly lifted the strange looking longsword in her hand and said helplessly, \u201cIf it is like this, then I\u2019ll have to use force.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha! Humans are always like this.\u201d Seeing the mysterious woman\u2019s action, the Amethyst Winged Lion immediately let loose a thundering laugh. A while later, the laughter finally receded and its voice became cold once more, \u201cI know that you are also a Dou Huang but if we were to really fight, it would be a real question of whether you are able to walk out of the Magic Beast Mountain Range alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be concerned about that.\u201d The mysterious woman responded indifferently as she lifted her hand gently. As she did so, a small wisp of a green colored tornado suddenly appeared in the air. Initially, the tornado was only two meters wide but a moment later, the tornado began to expand and turned into a huge tornado that was over a hundred feet wide.</p><br/><p>In the space between the sky and the ground, the green tornado whizzed and whirled, constantly uprooting the huge trees on the ground. The ferocious wind quickly grinded the trees down, filling the air with sawdust.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm! The Magic Beast Mountain Range is not the territory of you humans. You do not have the right to behave so atrociously!\u201d The Amethyst Winged Lion eyed the growing enormous tornado and growled. From its large mouth, a deep roar echoed throughout the mountain range.</p><br/><p>Following the lion\u2019s roar, the amethyst on its body shone brightly. In the blink of an eye, a savage purple flame violently surged forth from its body. The purple flame gradually spiraled upwards, finally forming an enormous pillar of purple that shot towards the sky. The intense heat caused Xiao Yan, who was a kilometer away, to perspire unceasingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a frightening condition.\u201d Xiao Yan spoke dryly as he wiped off the perspiration on his forehead and watched the distant huge tornado and fire pillar with awe.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, who do you think will win?\u201d After wiping his perspiration once more, Xiao Yan asked in a soft voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this stage, it is usually difficult to kill off the opponent in one blow unless one possesses an extremely strong trump card. As for who will win or lose, I cannot say for certain. Everything will be known once the fight is over.\u201d Yao Lao replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shook his head helplessly. Suddenly, he raised his head, watched the tense atmosphere, and whispered, \u201cThe fight is starting\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

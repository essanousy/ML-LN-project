With a sneer, she taunted: \u201cEven if your talent has come back, why does it matter? Three years ago, I, Xiao Yu, could make you flee for your life and three years later, I can still do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s brows jumped as he looked towards Xiao Yu\u2019s light purple school uniform where she had 3 gold stars on her chest. These stars represented Xiao Yu\u2019s strength, a three star Dou Zhe. Looks like her year in the academy wasn\u2019t wasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are your filthy eyes looking?\u201d Seeing where Xiao Yan was staring, Xiao Yu\u2019s already dark face become even darker.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you wearing that so that people notice you?\u201d Xiao Yan touched his nose. His words which were carelessly said, caused Xiao Yu to jump up in fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d Gnashing her teeth, Xiao Yu who was already at her limit finally pulled out her sword with a \u201cClang\u201d. Pointing her sword at Xiao Yan, she said: \u201cDo you really think that I\u2019m afraid to cut your tongue off?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Staring at the glittering steel sword in front of him, Xiao Yan didn\u2019t even blink when he said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you try?\u201d</p><br/><p>While talking, Xiao Yan\u2019s right hand curled slightly as a pulsing vortex slowly formed. With 3 Xuan Level Dou Techniques, Xiao Yan wasn\u2019t too afraid of a 3-star Dou Zhe.</p><br/><p>Watching the two who were about to come to blows, Xun Er, on the sidelines, helplessly shook her head. As she looked out into the distance, she smiled while alerting them: \u201cXiao shu-shu and them are coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Xun Er\u2019s words, Xiao Yu\u2019s brows furrowed and she turned her head to see Xiao Zhan hurrying over with an ugly face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, your good luck won\u2019t last.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the cold hmph, Xiao Yu returned her sword to its scabbard and turned around. Striding forward with her long legs, Xiao Yu paused before Xun Er, saying: \u201cXun Er biao-mei. Your talent and beauty are both top class but you should stay away from some people or else you might be stained with some bad habits. It would be too late for regrets then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Towards Xiao Yu\u2019s tip, Xun Er smiled while saying: \u201cThanks for Xiao Yu biao-jie\u2019s reminder but Xun Er thinks that Xiao Yan ge-ge is great.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Xun Er\u2019s meaningful words, Xiao Yu\u2019s face changed colors as she scanned over the smiling Xun Er. Finally, Xiao Yu profoundly said: \u201cOnce you leave the clan, you\u2019ll know how big the world is. There are countless people that are much more talented than him, if you meet someone that makes your heart flutter, then\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yu biao-jie, you\u2019re thinking too much. Xun Er doesn\u2019t believe that something like that will happen.\u201d Xun Er\u2019s red lips pursed as she interrupted Xiao Yu.</p><br/><p>After being interrupted by Xun Er, Xiao Yu became embarrassed so she left after giving Xiao Yan one final evil stare.</p><br/><p>Watching the angrily leaving Xiao Yu, Xiao Yan slowly let out a breath as his face full of disgust changed back into his normal, calm face. Sighing, he said: \u201cI really don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Xun Er covered her mouth as she laughed: \u201cActually, I\u2019m really curious as to why she always is going against Xiao Yan ge-ge. Even though you did accidentally stumble upon her bathing spot, she shouldn\u2019t be so against you right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d Xiao Yan innocently shrugged before looking towards Xiao Zhan and a couple more people walking towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan Er, are you alright? Where\u2019s Xiao Yu?\u201d Quickly walking over and seeing the unharmed Xiao Yan, Xiao Zhan let out a breath as he asked.</p><br/><p>Slightly shrugging, Xiao Yan laughed: \u201cI\u2019m fine. That woman just had blood rush to her head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should avoid her a bit. That girl has a bad temper and now that\u2019s she\u2019s a 3 star Dou Zhe, if you guys fight, you\u2019ll be on the losing end. In addition, she\u2019s the first elder\u2019s granddaughter so I\u2019m not in a good position to punish her if you guys fight.\u201d Xiao Zhan helplessly said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan touched his nose as smiled without giving an answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cHere Yan Er, this is Primer Auction House\u2019s top auctioneer, misses Ya Fei. The Foundation Elixir from last time was brought through her.\u201d Xiao Zhan moved aside to show the red-dressed woman behind him as he introduced her.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan watched the beautiful woman that showed maturity with her actions and revealed a shy smile that was appropriate for his age: \u201cHi Ya Fei-jie.\u201d</p><br/><p>TL: Jie means sister(can be used informal to mean some female slightly older than one)</p><br/><p>With her attractive eyes latched on Xiao Yan, Ya Fei\u2019s beautiful face showed a smile because of his addressal. With her red lips moving, Ya Fei asked while smiling: \u201cI heard that young master Xiao Yan raised 4 Duan Qi in just one year? Hehe, that training speed has become huge news in Wu Tan City, but is it real?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan tilted his head and \u201cshyly\u201d said: \u201cIt\u2019s the result of father\u2019s purchase of the Foundation Elixir.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s indirect admittance, even with Ya Fei\u2019s calm nature, she couldn\u2019t help but gasp. Curiosity and interest flashed across her eyes as she thought: <em>4 Duan Qi in just one year, that training speed, is frightening. As for that Foundation Elixir, I had personally examined it and naturally know the effects of it. It can help a bit with one\u2019s training speed but to raise 4 Duan Qi in just relying on it? Impossible!</em></p><br/><p>Seeing that the two had a basic introduction, Xiao Zhan looked up into the sky and patted Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulder. With a smile, he said: \u201cAlright, the Coming of Age Ceremony is about to start and I have prepare some things. Don\u2019t let me down later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded while smiling.</p><br/><p>Following Xiao Zhan, Ya Fei took a peek at Xiao Yan before she turned around. With a couple of years at the Auction House, she could discern even the smallest details and when she looked into the young man\u2019s eyes, she realized that even though the young man in front of her appeared shy, within his pitch black eyes, no emotions escaped. It was calm, like a secluded lake.</p><br/><p><em>To be able to control his emotions at such a young age\u2026 This brat isn\u2019t simple\u2026</em> Turning around, that thought sounded within Ya Fei\u2019s mind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

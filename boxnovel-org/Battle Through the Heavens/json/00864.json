It appeared like a grayish sun that repeatedly emitted a frighteningly high temperature that caused the air to distort. This kind of temperature was already very close to the Green Lotus Core Flame that Xiao Yan had obtained back then\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, this flame was merely close to it. A \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was a completely unique thing in this world. Nothing could replicate it. This point was something that Xiao Yan was clearly aware of in his heart. Although this so-called \u2018Flame Creation Skill\u2019 was mysterious, it was far from the level of being able to create a \u2018Heavenly Flame.\u2019 At its very best, it could only achieve something that was very close to that of a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. Always and forever\u2026 it would never be able to surpass the later!</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan was thinking in this manner, Fang Yan and the two Elders from the Demon Flame Valley clearly did not think the same way. They were filled with a great confidence by this grayish-brown flame formed from the merger of Dou Qi from their bodies. During these years, the \u2018Fake Heavenly Flame\u2019 that they had formed had caused quite a number of opponents to perish in their hands. These people included some of the peak experts within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019.</p><br/><p>The grayish-brown flame curled and slowly rose. It abruptly split into three clusters amid Feng Yan\u2019s cold laughter. After which, they flew out and entered the bodies of the three Elders.</p><br/><p>The aura that spread from the surface of Fang Yan\u2019s group suddenly turned a lot wilder and more violent when the grayish-brown flame entered their bodies. Waves of hot pressurizing wind merged together and swept toward Xiao Yan like floodwaters.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s clothes fluttered unceasingly as he stood within the torrent-like pressure. However, his expression did not change much. His gaze swept over the three of them before he suddenly laughed, \u201cYou three. Although you have merged and formed such a flame, doesn\u2019t it appear as though you have injured yourself before you even hurt another?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Yan coldly laughed when he heard Xiao Yan\u2019s laughter, \u201cChief Xiao really has sharp eyes. Each time we use the \u2018Flame Creation Skill\u2019 to merge and form this \u2018Life Transforming Flame\u2019, the interior of our bodies indeed ends up with quite a number of burns. However, it\u2019s not considered much if we are able to snatch the \u2018Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo this kind of flame is named \u2018Life Transforming Flame\u2019 by all of you\u2026 the \u2018Flame Creation Skill\u2019 of the Demon Flame Valley is indeed unique. However, compared to a true \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, this \u2018Life Transforming Flame\u2019 of yours is still a little inferior.\u201d Xiao Yan slightly smiled. His hand slowly moved and formed seals in front of him before it suddenly stilled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSkyfire Three Mysterious Change!\u201d</p><br/><p>The cry sounded within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart as an emerald-colored flame streaked from his body like a volcano. It lingered over the surface of his body for a moment before it gradually withdrew into his body. Following the withdrawal of the flame, Xiao Yan\u2019s aura suddenly soared.</p><br/><p>The actual strength of Xiao Yan was that of a four star Dou Huang. Adding this to his physical strength, which far exceeded those experts of his level, his Qi Method, and the increase in his strength from borrowing of the \u2018Sky Fire Three Mysterious Change\u2019, he was able to contend against someone at the peak of the Dou Huang class without using any Dou Skills. Of course, he was a little weaker when compared to Fang Yan, who was an expert with half a foot in the Dou Zong level.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have long heard that chief Xiao is in possession of a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. Please show it to us today and allow us three old fellows to widen our perspective. Now that we think about it, this \u2018Life Transforming Flame\u2019 of ours has never contended against a true \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. Today, we will ask for advice from chief Xiao.\u201d Fang Yan coldly laughed. His face did not reveal the slightest surprise in the face of Xiao Yan\u2019s soaring aura. Clearly, they were already aware that Xiao Yan possessed a secret technique that could raise his strength.</p><br/><p>The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth was slowly lifted into a sly arc when he heard this. If they really wished to fight three against one, he would honestly have to spend quite a bit of effort. However, these three old fellow did not choose to use Dou Qi to fight. Instead, they wanted to challenge Xiao Yan with a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. This was undoubtedly using their weak point to challenge another person\u2019s strong point. It was no different from seeking to make things difficult for themselves.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently flicked his finger and a cluster of flames was suspended in his hand. This cluster of flame was not an emerald-jade color. Instead, it was a pale-green one. It was not the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, but the first \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 of Xiao Yan that he had not used for a long time, the Green Lotus Core Flame\u2026</p><br/><p>This \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was the first flame that Xiao Yan possessed. He was extremely familiar with controlling it. The flame was little different from the moving clouds and flowing water under his control. There was not the slightest unfamiliar feeling to it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gaze drifted after he had displayed the Green Lotus Core Flame. At this moment, Su Qian and the Little Fairy Doctor were each being delayed by Han Feng and Mo Tian Xing. Both of them had descended into an intense battle. On the other side, Mo Ya and Qi Shan had gradually rose into the air to head to Zi Yan with ill intent. Clearly, they planned to join hands and subdue Zi Yan\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze swept over Mo Ya and Qi Shan, causing his eyes narrowed. A sharp cold glint flashed in them. He had never expected these two bastards to be this unscrupulous to actually bully a little girl with numbers.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan threw her gaze over after having seemed to have sensed Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze. Both pair of eyes entangled with each other before the former saucily smiled. A clear voice was transmitted into Xiao Yan\u2019s ears, \u201cRelax, I can deal with these two fellows. Just remain relaxed and deal with those three old fellows who will not die\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was slightly startled upon hearing Zi Yan\u2019s voice. Seeing that the latter did not reveal an overly worried look, Xiao Yan felt much more relaxed. Zi Yan\u2019s original form was extremely mysterious. Moreover, her background also did not seem to be simple. She also possessed a never-ending number of tactics. Although she had only entered the Dou Huang class for a short period of time, her fighting strength was quite great. Even though Mo Ya and Qi Shan had joined hands, it would not be a simple matter to finish off Zi Yan within a short period of time\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cChief Xiao, now is not the time to be distracted\u2026\u201d Fang Yan gave a dense laugh while Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze was looking in all directions. The seal in his hands moved immediately and the grayish-brown flame suddenly turned into a half-a-foot-large fire bird. The fire bird flapped its wings as its sharp fire beak attacked Xiao Yan in a lightning-like manner.</p><br/><p>The grayish-brown fire bird flew through the sky. Within the blink of an eye, it appeared at a spot over ten feet from Xiao Yan. However, before it could flap its wings again, a pale-green fire net strangely extended out before wrapping around the grayish-brown fire bird.</p><br/><p>Fang Yan\u2019s eyes turned slightly cold after the fire bird was wrapped. His hand seals moved and the fire bird swiftly expanded like a balloon that had been filled with air. The grayish flame repeatedly grilled the pale-green fire net, cooking the later until it became slightly illusionary\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out a soft exclamation as he sensed the change in the fire net that was formed from the Green Lotus Core Flame. An unusual glint flickered in his eyes. This \u2018Fake Heavenly Flame,\u2019 that Fang Yan\u2019s three men team had used Do Qi to create, did indeed possess some unique qualities. At the very least, it was much stronger than some \u2018Beast Flame\u2019. However\u2026 a \u2018Fake Heavenly Flame\u2019 was ultimately fake regardless of how strong it was. In front of a genuine \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, it would still be extremely fragile!</p><br/><p>A cold smile surfaced on the corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth as he clenched his hand. The fire bird, that had swelled to the point where it was about to break the green fire net, abruptly emitted an intense fire glow. Suddenly, it began to shrink!</p><br/><p>\u201cPuchi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tight shrinking of the fire net caused a \u2018Puchi\u2019 sound to appear. The enormous fire bird was strangled by the green fire net into flame spots. Finally, they surged out of the flame like a swarm of bees and entered Fang Yan\u2019s body from all directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>A muffled snort sounded in Fang Yan\u2019s throat after the flame returned to his body. Clearly, he was slightly injured during the flame collision earlier.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was once again surprised by the \u2018Life Transforming Flame\u2019 ability to split itself apart to dodge the fire net lock. Disbelief surged in his heart. \u201cIf I capture this so-called \u2018Life Transforming Flame\u2019 and use \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 to swallow it\u2026 I wonder if it would enable the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 to evolve a little?\u201d</p><br/><p>This \u2018Life Transformation Flame\u2019 that Fang Yan\u2019s three men group had displayed could be said to be the strongest type of flame among all the non-Heavenly Flames fire that Xiao Yan had seen. As long as it was a flame, \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 would be able to swallow and refine it. This was just like the \u2018Purple Flame\u2019 that Xiao Yan had refined back then\u2026 Of course, with the current class of the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019. Swallowing any ordinary beast flame would no longer be useful. However. This \u2018Life Transforming Flame\u2019 was a little different. There might be some benefits if he were to capture it\u2026</p><br/><p>This \u2018Life Transforming Flame\u2019 was formed from the gathering of all the Dou Qi that belonged in Fang Yan and the other two Elders. If he captured it, the strength of Fang Yan and the other two would definitely be reduced. No one knew just how much more time they would need in order to return to this level. The dense smile on the corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth had unknowingly turned even denser when he thought until this point.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince all of you wish to play with fire, I shall teach all of you what is called burning oneself when playing with fire!\u201d Xiao Yan muttered in his heart. A flame was shapeless and without substance. It was naturally extremely difficult for an ordinary person to capture it. However, this was not too difficult for Xiao Yan who possessed two types of \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019...</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother, third brother!\u201d Fang Yan, who had suffered a hidden disadvantage, revealed a slightly dark and solemn expression when this thought was lingering in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart. The former cried in a sharp voice, \u201cStar Fire Phoenix!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two Demon Flame Valley\u2019s Elders were slightly startled when they heard this sharp cry by Fang Yan. They exchanged glances and immediately clenched their teeth. The seals on their hands changed and a dense grayish-brown flame suddenly surged from their bodies in all directions. They immediately entwined with each other in the sky. When Fang Yan completely merged the \u2018Life Transforming Flame\u2019 within his body, an unusually intense energy ripple swiftly spread from the grayish-brown flame\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cJi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The grayish-brown flame repeatedly churned like a cloud layer. A moment later, a clear bird cry suddenly carried a hot wind from the grayish-brown flame. Fire clouds rippled and an enormous gray-colored fire bird, over a hundred feet in size, slowly agglomerated within the grayish-brown flame\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not easy to be able to agglomerate the flame into such a shape\u2026\u201d Surprise also flashed across Xiao Yan eyes as he observed the enormous divine bird in the sky made out of flames. An unusual smile surged onto his face as a soft mutter quietly sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis star phoenix should have been formed from the fire that was agglomerated within these three people\u2019s bodies\u2026 since this is the case, I shall unceremoniously accept all of them!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

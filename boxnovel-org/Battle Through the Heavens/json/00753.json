Her extremely attractive curves were even more eye-catching. She lazily opened her eyes and looked at the stunned Xiao Yan in the sky. A naughty thought rose within her heart and she threw an embarrassed gaze that hid a flirting look toward the latter.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s entire body shivered in the sky upon receiving the flirting gaze. He bitterly smiled and shook his head. This girl still had the character of a child.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan moved his body and slowly descended. He did not look as he took out a robe from his storage ring, and was about to hand it over to Zi Yan. However, his body had yet to come into contact with the other when the latter\u2019s body shook. An unusual green glow erupted from her body. Under this green glow, Zi Yan\u2019s body began to quickly shrink at a rate visible to the naked eye. In merely a couple of breaths, the great beauty who possessed a lovely figure immediately turned into a little girl who was still naked.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was stunned as he looked at this transformation of Zi Yan. He could not help but laughed out loud as he shook his head. It seemed that advancing to rank 6 did not allow Zi Yan to completely resolve the medicinal effects of that Body Transformation Grass.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan was also shocked because of this change of hers. However, when she saw that her body had once again transformed back into the little girl of the past, her two small eyebrows immediately became vertical. She looked at Xiao Yan gloating in front of her and involuntarily pounced forward angrily. Both of her hands repeatedly clawed randomly at Xiao Yan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s hand hugged Zi Yan who had pounced forward. He felt her extremely soft, smooth jade-like skin and his eyes immediately began to drift. He let out a dry cough. He hurriedly and forcefully placed the black robe in his hand onto Zi Yan\u2019s body. After which, he violently knocked on her head and said, \u201cBe quiet. Otherwise, I will not help you refine a \u2018Body Transformation Pill\u2019 in the future, and let you continue to have this appearance for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Yan covered her little head and curled her mouth with an unwillingness. However, she was still quite afraid of Xiao Yan\u2019s threat. Hence, she could only lower her head and mutter, \u201cThis damn Body Transforming Grass\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan pinched Zi Yan\u2019s jade-carving-like cute face and laughed, \u201cThis appearance of yours is not bad. It is really likeable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi, what duplicity. You clearly liked that other figure just now. Don\u2019t think I was unaware of it. Cai Lin jie said that all of you men are like this.\u201d Zi Yan used disdainful eyes to look at Xiao Yan. The appearance of the latter earlier was on the edge of causing one to have a nosebleed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan immediately felt embarrassed when he heard this. He ruthlessly pinched Zi Yan\u2019s face and hurriedly changed the topic of the conversation. \u201cAlright, since you have successfully advanced, let us leave this place. I may not know exactly how long we have stayed but I think that it has likely been a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas Cai Lin jie left first?\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s eyes swept over the valley as she spoke with a deep thought. She could vaguely sense the activity in the valley while she had transformed into a cocoon. She had faintly sensed when Medusa had left back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, something happened to the Snake-People Tribe and she needed to return to resolve it. We can also make a trip there once we leave and lend our hand.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded. He placed Zi Yan down and smiled as he replied. For such a long time, Medusa had been providing him with a lot of help. Moreover, even though he was forced to do that matter back then, it was impossible to really act like it was just a lustful night no matter how one put it. Hence, his feelings for Medusa were also quite complicated.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan naturally did not object to this. Her relationship with Cai Lin was quite good. It was natural that she would go and help the latter.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s body moved when he saw Zi Yan nodding her head, and appeared in the air without any warning. He lifted his head and looked at that somewhat distorted space not far away, Zi Yan also followed behind him. She swept her gaze over it and said in a surprised manner, \u201cThis is a spatial seal, right? Only an elite Dou Zong can use it. I think that this should be left behind by Cai Lin jie, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, she needed to leave in a hurry and was afraid that others would disturb our advancement. Therefore, she placed this spatial lock over this valley.\u201d Xiao Yan looked at the distorted space and spoke without turning his head, \u201cMove aside. I will break it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Dou Qi within Xiao Yan\u2019s body wildly surged once he said this. This spatial lock that was created from all of Medusa\u2019s strength was unusually strong. If he had not advanced to the Dou Huang class, the chances of him successfully breaking it were extremely low.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll you know is how to use brute force\u2026\u201d Zi Yan by the side curled her lips when she saw this. Her body immediately began to slowly rise and a strange purple glow seeped out from her body just when she was about to make contact with the distorted space. After which, her body became like a fish as she penetrated the distorted space and disappeared.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face was completely stunned as he watched Zi Yan do this. A moment later, he bitterly laughed and shook his head. He had forgotten that Zi Yan seemed to have an immunity to these kinds of locks. Back then, the various enchantments placed on the medicinal warehouse did not have the slightest effect of blocking her. Despite this, Xiao Yan was still somewhat surprised that she could so easily pass through this distorted space.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan\u2019s body once again blended and came out from the distorted space while Xiao Yan was surprise. She extended a small snow-white hand toward Xiao Yan and gloatingly laughed, \u201cFollow me, I will bring you out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also smiled when he saw this but he did not reject her offer. This small valley possessed quite a lot of rare medicinal ingredient. Having the spatial seal here would coincidentally prevent people from accidently roaming into this place.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan grabbed Zi Yan and a faint purple glow immediately spread over him from the latter. It swiftly wrapped around Xiao Yan. Both their bodies shrank and charged into the distorted space before disappearing\u2026</p><br/><p>A lush green color from the endless mountain range filled Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. Wild wind blew over and a whistle resounded over the mountain range. It unleashed a limitless liveliness within this valley.</p><br/><p>The space in the air of a secret region between a couple of mountain peaks within the mountain range suddenly fluctuated. Two human figures slowly appeared. Their eyes moved in all directions, and they felt the cooling breeze that blew toward them. Their bodies felt light like they could drift away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have finally come out\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan could not help but sigh in relief as he looked at the vast mountain range. After having stayed for such a long period of time in the cave, he had nearly forgotten what the feeling of wind blowing across his body was like.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan by the side randomly swept her gaze around. She secretly sighed in relief when she did not find any Magical Beasts around her. She still remembered the frightening beast tide that she and Cai Lin had stirred up within the Magical Beast Mountain Range before she transformed into a cocoon. Even Medusa could only bring her along and flee under that beast tide. Despite having already advanced, she still involuntarily felt the skin on her head turn numb when she thought of the densely packed crazy Magical Beasts.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan did not notice the little actions of Zi Yan. After having determined their direction, he waved toward her and a pair of fire wings instantly extended out. After which, he flew toward the exit of the mountain range. Zi Yan at the back carefully observed her surroundings before hurriedly following him.</p><br/><p>The two human figures turned into light rays that flew across the sky. Their high speed brought about a wind pressure that left behind a ripple on the sea of trees underneath them. However, Xiao Yan\u2019s body suddenly paused after having flown for around three to five minutes. Zi Yan at the back could not react in time and slammed into Xiao Yan\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Zi Yan rubbed her forehead and grumbled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems a little too quiet\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes and slowly said. His eyes swept over his surroundings as he did so. He had yet to hear a single beast roar since he had come out of the valley. This kind of situation might be very normal if it appeared somewhere else. However, it was clearly not right if it appeared within the Magical Beast Mountain Range which was covered in Magical Beasts.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan also felt that something was a little amiss when she heard this. Her small eyebrows were vertical as she sensed her surroundings for a moment. She nodded and said, \u201cYes, the surroundings do not have any Magical Beast\u2019s aura. Moreover\u2026\u201d She suddenly twitched her small nose when she reached this point. \u201cThere seems to be an unusual smell in the air\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was initially startled when he heard this. He slightly knit his brows and inhaled a breath of air. His expression changed a moment later. He spoke in a dark and solemn manner, \u201cDon\u2019t inhale it into your body. The air is mixed with poisonous gas, but it is very faint\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly happened?\u201d This thought churned within his heart. The mystery that had suddenly appeared caused Xiao Yan\u2019s heart to feel some pressure. For some unknown reason, he repeatedly felt a faint uneasiness. After musing for a moment, he waved his hand and spoke with a deep voice, \u201cLet\u2019s go. We will head to the small Qingshan Town to take a look first.\u201d In this situation, it seemed that he must look for a place where there were people in order to be able to gain some information.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this poisonous gas released by that person?\u201d Zi Yan nodded slightly before suddenly asking. The person she mentioned was naturally the Little Fairy Doctor whom they had met by chance in the valley back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should not be the case.. This poison gas is not considered strong and the difference when compared to her is like that between the Heavens and Earth. However, why would so much spread around?\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head. He clearly understood the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s current poison skill. If she were to release it, it was likely that there would not be a single person left alive within five hundred kilometers.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut what exactly happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan muttered to himself within his heart while he frowned. The fire wings on his back were flapped and his body immediately transformed into a blurry figure that shot toward the spot the small Qingshan Town was located.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

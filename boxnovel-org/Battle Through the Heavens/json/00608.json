Only at this moment did he recall that the allure of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 had caused him to forget about a great enemy who was looking on covetously from not too far away!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s figure appeared behind Han Feng in a ghost-like manner just as the latter\u2019s expression changed. His five fingers were tightly clenched, and the green-colored flame repeatedly withered over his fist. Finally, it carried a hot wind and violently smashed into Han Feng\u2019s back.</p><br/><p>Han Feng had the intention of dodging as he sensed the sharp ear-piercing wind that contained a killing intent behind him. His intention was to dodge it, but due to his body suppressing the heart flame, the speed of his body and his reaction speed were all greatly weakened. Hence, he appeared to be only able to quietly wait for the arrival of the attack after his futile attempt to dodge it.</p><br/><p>The sharp wind grew increasingly close and it pressed Han Feng\u2019s robes tightly onto his back. However, when Xiao Yan thought that the former would sit still, a ruthlessness suddenly flashed across Han Feng\u2019s face. His shoulder suddenly shook violently and a wave of deep blue flames immediately surged out from his shoulders.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan felt slightly surprised at Han Feng being able to divide his attention to defend at such a moment. However, this did not cause him to hesitate even a little. The force on his fist increased instead of weakening. Immediately, it carried a wild and violent wind as it penetrated through the dark-blue flame and heavily smashed into the former\u2019s\u2026 shoulder.</p><br/><p>The moment Xiao Yan struck Han Feng, the dark-blue flame that was spread on the latter\u2019s back appeared to have been dragged by something as it suddenly shrank. It immediately became like a heavy hammer that heavily smashed into Xiao Yan\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The wild and ferocious force erupted at the point of contact. Two figures, which were wounded, shot back. They flew for over ten meters in the sky before slowly coming to a stop.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan extended his hand to pat his somewhat tattered clothes in front of his chest. His expression did not change much. The earlier attack may have appeared fierce, but it was merely a last minute counterattack by Han Feng. All it did was to merely cause his chest to feel oppressed.</p><br/><p>Compared to Xiao Yan, Han Feng, who was firmly struck by Xiao Yan\u2019s sneak attack, had a somewhat ugly expression. Although he eventually dodged Xiao Yan\u2019s fatal blow at the very last minute, the ferocious wind that was contained on the other\u2019s fist still caused half his arm to feel somewhat numb.</p><br/><p>The human figures in the sky that were wrapped in green-colored flames and blue-colored flames faced each other from a distance. Each of their eyes carried quite an unfriendly killing intent.</p><br/><p>Han Feng\u2019s gaze glanced at the chaotic battle that had erupted in the air. He frowned slightly. At this moment, he was pressed for time and could not be delayed by this fellow for too long. Otherwise, when an expert from the Jia Nan Academy was to free their hands, it was likely that the difficulty of him obtaining the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 would increase greatly.</p><br/><p>Han Feng raised his head as he mused. He narrowed his eyes and stared at the black-robed, young man who was smiling coldly in the distance. With a sudden smile, he cupped his hands toward the latter and laughed, \u201cKe ke, this little brother. I think that you are also an alchemist, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan ignored this action of Han Feng who he was watching with cold eyes. He quietly maneuvered his Dou Qi and prepared to unleash an attack at any second.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince little brother is also an alchemist, I think that you should also know that only one kind of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 can exist within a person\u2019s body. If the body were to contain a second \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, the \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 would reject each other and there would be a risk of one\u2019s body exploding.\u201d Han Feng smiled as he explained, \u201cHence, this \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 does not have much use to little brother now. If you are willing to give me a favor, I will be willing to use a tier 6 medicinal pill to exchange for it. What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The cold smile on the corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth expended upon hearing Han Feng\u2019s words. He gently flapped the green fire wings on his back as he coldly mocked, \u201cSince you are also aware that an alchemist cannot have two kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 existing in his body at any one time, why don\u2019t you give this opportunity to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng\u2019s expression changed a little. From the tone that Xiao Yan had used, Han Feng\u2019s heart became clearly aware that the chances of persuading Xiao Yan to step back were basically insignificant. The smile on his face was slowly withdrawn as he raised his arm. His gaze watched the dark-blue flame that was flashing playfully on it as he spoke indifferently, \u201cIn that case, I will\u2026 also take your \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the last word sounded, the dark-blue flame that was wrapped around Han Feng suddenly exploded. A figure that moved in a ghost-like manner leaped toward Xiao Yan like lightning. The sound of the wind and killing intent spread all over the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am coincidentally interested in your \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. It is difficult to say for certain who will end up taking the other\u2019s flame!\u201d Xiao Yan, who had been placing his attention on Han Feng\u2019s body, sensed something the moment the latter\u2019s body flashed. He let out a cold smile as rolling thunder sounded from under his feet. His body had similar disappeared suddenly. The next time it reappeared, it was surprisingly intersecting with that ghost-like figure!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a wild and arrogant little brat. You were still drinking milk at some unknown place when I became renowned in the continent!\u201d Han Feng coldly smiled when he saw that Xiao Yan actually showed no signs of dodging. The dark-blue flame surged out from his body and swiftly agglomerated on both his palms. They appeared just like heavy waves that came layer upon layer. If one were to look carefully, it was surprisingly just like an actual sea wave that filled one\u2019s heart with shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to see whether your \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 is stronger or this \u2018Sea Heart Flame\u2019 of mine is better!\u201d</p><br/><p>With a sharp cry, Han Feng pushed both his hands forward. The deep blue flame that swiftly agglomerated on his palm immediately erupted in a loud wave-like sound as it rumbled and swept toward Xiao Yan!</p><br/><p>Han Feng had unleashed a lethal attack as his first move. It appeared that he was no longer concerned about retaining his strength in order to save time.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful. This \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 condenses into a shape. The formed shape of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 has an extremely frightening strength!\u201d Yao Lao solemn cry suddenly sounded in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart, causing the expression of the latter to change slightly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression was serious as he watched the dark-blue flame that came sweeping over from all directions. Being engulfed by the fire wave, he even felt a feeling as though he was present in a large ocean. He inhaled a deep breath of hot air and all the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 within his body that could be maneuvered surged out from Xiao Yan\u2019s body!</p><br/><p>The \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 that agglomerated above Xiao Yan\u2019s head also became increasingly emerald-like in color as the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 surged out unceasingly. In the blink of an eye, the flame began to wiggle in a strange manner. A moment later, a green-colored lotus that was completely formed from the gathering of the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 suddenly surfaced.</p><br/><p>This green-colored fire lotus was like a transparent emerald. Threads of green-colored lava-like strands were flowing unceasingly within it, appearing extremely beautiful.</p><br/><p>\u201cCondensing into form\u2026 is not something that you alone know!\u201d</p><br/><p>The green-colored lotus rotated slowly. Xiao Yan suddenly widened his eyes and watched the surprise in Han Feng\u2019s eyes not far away. He let out a cold laugh as he pushed his palm. That green-colored lotus appeared in front of his palm as though it had teleported. Immediately, it carried an incomparable force as it heavily collided with Han Feng\u2019s overlapping waves.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire space became silent the moment the two came into contact. Immediately, a furious thunder-like explosion suddenly reverberated across the sky!</p><br/><p>Green and blue fire waves adulterated with one another as they swept out in all directions. Even the clouds high in the sky were shattered by the fire waves wherever they passed, forming white spots that came shattering down from the sky.</p><br/><p>The frightening energy ripples that suddenly erupted in the sky also caused the chaotic battleground to be slightly quiet. Quite a number of people quietly sucked their tongues as they sensed the terrifying energy that was contained in the fire waves. Was this the destructive strength when \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 collided? It did indeed cause people to feel a chill...</p><br/><p>Two human figures which were shaken by the ferocious strength until they were forced back dozens of meters slowly appeared in everyone\u2019s eyes only after the fire waves had gradually subsided. The moment they saw the two miserable figures, the expressions on everyone\u2019s faces immediately changed a little.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was panting hard. The sleeves on his arms had been completely shattered. A large charred black scar was on his hand. Even his face was also mixed with a faint paleness.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan appeared miserable, Han Feng in the distance was similarly not any better. His robe was in tatters, his hair unkempt and his breathing was ragged. However, he did not pay even the slightest attention to his miserable body at this moment. His eyes were filled with shock and disbelief as they watched Xiao Yan on the opposite side. That manner was as though he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze watched that comical manner of Han Feng and could not help but part his mouth to laugh. His white teeth caused the latter to feel a chill all over his body, \u201cHave you discovered it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng\u2019s finger trembled as it pointed at Xiao Yan. He panted heavily for quite a while before his sharp hoarse voice sounded through the sky, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 what is the Qi Method\u2026 that you practice? Speak! Tell me! Otherwise I will kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The chaotic battle in the sky had stopped because of the ferocious and intense collision between Xiao Yan and Han Feng. Hence, all of them faced each other when they saw the somewhat crazy Han Feng, not knowing what they should do.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan merely smiled when he saw the somewhat crazy Han Feng. His smile may be brilliant, but that coldness caused one to feel a chill in one\u2019s heart, \u201cAren\u2019t you already clearly aware of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>These words from Xiao Yan were somewhat ridiculous in the ears of some people, but it caused Han Feng\u2019s eyes to shrink to the size of a pinhole after it entered his ears. That uneasiness that had been hidden within his heart slowly spread throughout his body. After that ferocious collision from earlier, he could clearly sense that the Qi Method which the other party practiced was shockingly very similar to his own! If he was to carefully sensed it, Han Feng even realized that the Qi Method which Xiao Yan practiced was purer and more orthodox than his.</p><br/><p>Flame Mantra!</p><br/><p>Back then, he did not hesitate to secretly murder his own teacher in order to obtain this Flame Mantra. However, he did not accomplish his aim. In the end, all he did was merely obtain an incomplete Qi Method. However, it was this incomplete Qi Method that allowed Han Feng to subdue the \u2018Sea Heart Flame\u2019 and allowed him to possess his current status and strength!</p><br/><p>However, the instant he collided with Xiao Yan earlier, he could clearly sense that the other party\u2019s Qi Method was even more orthodox compared to his!</p><br/><p>There was only one kind of Qi Method that was even more orthodox and purer than an incomplete Flame Mantra.</p><br/><p>That was a complete Flame Mantra!</p><br/><p>Only at this moment did a wild killing intent for Xiao Yan surface from all directions within Han Feng\u2019s heart!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

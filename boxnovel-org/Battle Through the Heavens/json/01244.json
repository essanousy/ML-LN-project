This was because he had also refined one of his own. Moreover, this current Earth Demon Puppet had already evolved until the Sky Demon Puppet stage\u2026</p><br/><p>Those puppet outside of the stone door were completely bright silver. Clearly, they were still at the Earth Demon Puppet level. Base on Xiao Yan\u2019s estimation, these ten Earth Demon Puppet should have the strength equivalent to the peak of the Dou Zong class. They could already be considered quite strong. However, it would be a little lacking if one wished to stop the many experts from the Central Plains with just them alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like the true remains is behind this stone door.\u201d Little Fairy Doctor looked at this heavy stone door and softly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. However, the stone door is tightly shut. There\u2019s also a faint spatial fluctuation on it. Clearly, one cannot use brute force to open it. In that case, the method to open it would likely lie in these ten puppets.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded slightly. His eyes swept once around and discovered that most people\u2019s eyes were pausing on the puppets. Clearly, all of them understood this in their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrently, there is no need for us to attack. There will naturally be people who will take care of this kind of thing\u2026\u201d Tian Huo zun-zhe laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily smiled and nodded upon hearing this old cunning laughter of Tian Huo zun-zhe. They stood randomly on a remote part of the square and watched the action of everyone present.</p><br/><p>While Xiao Yan\u2019s group remained quiet, the square experienced some private conversations and hesitation before a gray clothed old man slowly stepped out. From his vast and mighty aura, he was obviously an elite Dou Zun. However, a glance from Xiao Yan\u2019s group allowed them to recognise that this old man was merely just a one star Dou Zun.</p><br/><p>The sect that this gray clothed old man belonged to was one that Xiao Yan had never seen before. However, he did not think too much about it. The Central Plains was extremely vast. There was an unknown number of hidden experts within it. The strength that some of the low profile factions had was not much weaker than those renown factions.</p><br/><p>The old man slowly walked out in front of the many gazes. Vast and mighty Dou Qi lingered around him as he directly walked into the area surrounded by the ten Earth Demon Puppet. That manner appeared as though he had an exceptionally great courage.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrack!\u201d</p><br/><p>When that old man was around a hundred feet into the stone door, those ten statue like unmoving figures emitted a low and deep bone cracking sound. Immediately, ten icy cold empty eyes directly stared at the gray clothed old man. Their hands were clenched and silver light surged from them. Ten bright silver long spear appeared in their hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cSizzle!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bright silver light flashed. The ten figures were just like lightning as they carried a sharp wind and attacked the gray clothed old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, it is merely a couple of broken puppets. Yet, you are intending on blocking the old me!\u201d</p><br/><p>That gray clothed old man laughed out loud upon seeing this. He charged into the group of puppet without any weapon in his hands. Majestic Dou Qi surged. Each time he swung his fist, he would force a puppet backwards.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily shook his head as he looked at the gray clothed old man, who was not at a disadvantage despite fighting against ten alone. The gap between the Dou Zong and Dou Zun class was too great. Although these ten puppets had successfully blocked the gray clothed old man, it was obvious from this situation that they would not be able to endure for long.</p><br/><p>\u201cClang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Silver light danced within the battleground. The gray clothed old man directly forced three puppets back. His hand, which contained a deep yellow colour, left a half a finger deep palm imprint on the puppets\u2019 body.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d</p><br/><p>With their continuous defeat, the ten Earth Demon Puppet suddenly paused their footsteps. Silver glow flashed in their eyes and a low and deep roar was actually emitted from their throats. Immediately, their footsteps moved in an orderly manner and immediately formed a strange formation. Silver glow flickered. Waves after waves of silver snake like energy surged out from within their bodies. After which, they were directly connected to each other, forming a circular ring in the process.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the circular ring was formed, the leading earth demon puppet\u2019s throat once again emitted a roar. Immediately, the silver glow weakened in front of Xiao Yan\u2019s stunned eyes. A little golden light gradually appeared. A moment later, the golden light completely replaced the silver glow.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has actually evolved\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes involuntarily shrunk a little upon seeing this scene. He clearly understood just how difficult it was for the Earth Demon Puppet to evolve into the Sky Demon Puppet. Back then, the Earth Demon Puppet had absorbed a lot of Pill Lightning in order to evolve at the last moment. Yet, this Earth Demon Puppet had actually completed this within a short instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is the effect of the formation. No wonder it is something left by an elite Dou Sheng. The strange formation of ten Earth Demon Puppet together is sufficient to contend against a two star Dou Zun. This old fellow is going to be unlucky!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan swiftly calmed down and softly muttered to himself after the shock in his heart continued for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwoosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>That gold-yellow Sky Demon Puppet in the battleground stomped on the ground. Crack lines spread while its body emitted a \u2018swoosh\u2019 sound and appeared in front of the old man, who had experienced a drastic change in expression. His fist, which contained a golden light, was violently swung out.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Faced with the extremely powerful fist, that old man hurriedly used all of his strength to meet it. At this moment, however, his natural and unrestrained manner was no longer present. The Heaven Demon Puppet after evolving had a strength that was far from what he could imagine. Immediately, a deep sound appeared. A muffled snort was emitted from his throat and a trace of blood surfaced from the corner of his mouth. He staggered backward at the same time.</p><br/><p>After the old man withdrew by a distance of a hundred feet, the Sky Demon Puppet once again withdrew its fist. Its body flashed and appeared outside of the stone door. The golden light disappeared and it once again turned into an Earth Demon Puppet, which stood guard at that spot.</p><br/><p>This kind of unexpected occurrence had also cause the faces of quite a number of people to change. They might not be afraid of ten Earth Demon Puppet at the peak of the Dou Zong class. However, this Sky Demon Puppet, with a strength of a two star Dou Zun, caused them to fear it greatly. This thing did not possess any sense of pain. It was no different from a killing machine. There were indeed experts present who could finish it off. However, even if one defeated it, one would end up being greatly exhausted. Who would be willing to experience such an exhaustion before even seeing the remains? Those people present did not have such magnanimity.</p><br/><p>For a moment, the square descended into an embarrassing atmosphere. Everyone wanted to enter but no one was willing to engage in a life and death battle with these puppets.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. His eyes directly looked towards the ten puppets. An expression of desire flashed across his eyes. If these puppets really only possessed the strength of the peak of the Dou Zong class, he might really not be interested in them. However, if they could reach a two star Dou Zun level Sky Demon Puppet, it was a different matter altogether\u2026 moreover, Xiao Yan was also extremely interested in the mysterious formation of the Earth Demon Puppet. If he added his Sky Demon Puppet into it, it was likely that the strength of the Sky Demon Puppet would rise greatly within a short period of time.</p><br/><p>His Sky Demon Puppet was currently able to fight against a three star Dou Zun. If he was to add these ten Earth Demon Puppets and the formation to aid it, it was likely that it could even fight against a five star Dou Zun.</p><br/><p>This allure was sufficient to get Xiao Yan to act personally\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me keep an eye on the others\u2026\u201d A silver glow flickered in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes as he softly spoke to Little Fairy Doctor. His toes immediately pressed on the ground and his body rushed over everyone\u2019s head like a large bird and steadily landed a hundred feet from the stone door.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince no one is going to attack, allow me to be the first to do so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone were startled as they looked at Xiao Yan, who had suddenly stepped forward. Some of those, who had an enmity with Xiao Yan, frowned slightly. Given their understanding of the latter, this fellow was too shrewd. How would it be possible for him to take the initiative to deal with these troublesome puppets?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little fellow has taken the initiative to show himself. He definitely has some motive!\u201d Feng Qing Er frowned slightly and softly said.</p><br/><p>The white haired man by the side glanced at Xiao Yan\u2019s back and laughed. He actually slowly walked out and said, \u201cWith your one star Dou Zun\u2019s strength, you cannot even be compared to the First Elder of the Ground Xuan Sect earlier. I think you should forget about it. Coincidentally, I am quite interested in these puppets. If I bring them back to act as door guards, it would appear quite domineering.</p><br/><p>This person\u2019s eyes were extremely sharp. He appeared to have seen through Xiao Yan intention towards these puppets with a glance.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan knitted his brows slightly in the face of this white haired man, who had suddenly interfered. He immediately shook his head and said, \u201cThis is not a matter you can be worried about.\u201d</p><br/><p>After uttering those words, Xiao Yan\u2019s foot suddenly pressed on the ground. His body directly charge into a hundred feet radius of the stone door. Seeing this, the white haired man also smiled. His body flashed and he also charge in. He waved his sleeves and a sharp wind was swung towards Xiao Yan\u2019s back in front of him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s back appeared to have some eyes growing on them in the face of this wind that was headed towards him from behind. His body was twisted and he easily dodged it. A thought passed through his heart and the vast and mighty Spiritual Strength lingering between his eyebrows also surged out in all directions. After which, it transformed into thousands of parts that rushed towards those puppets that were emitting a silver glow.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had once created the Earth Demon Puppet and was clearly aware of the weakness of such puppets. If it was a head on collision, one could only end the battle after tearing them into pieces. However, Xiao Yan did not wish to shatter them. What he wanted was control, a control that was similar to that which he had over his Sky Demon Puppet.</p><br/><p>The spiritual imprint of the Earth Demon Puppet\u2019s creator was present within its body. As long as this spiritual imprint was removed and a spiritual imprint of his own was to replaced it, he would be able to easily control the puppets. However, this kind of spiritual imprint was hidden in a very deep spot. If it was not because Xiao Yan had personally created one, it would be impossible for him to be aware of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! This brat is really intending to control the puppets!\u201d</p><br/><p>The white haired man had also sensed it when Xiao Yan\u2019s Spiritual Strength spread. He was unaware of the method to control the puppet. Hence, he was unable to snatch from Xiao Yan. However, he was also not an ordinary person. Seeing that he was unable to stop Xiao Yan, he flashed his body and appeared in front of an Earth Demon Puppet. A fist was violently swung and it landed heavily onto its body.</p><br/><p>Since he was unable to obtain it, he would destroy it!</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the frightening fist landed, the Earth Demon Puppet\u2019s body immediately cracked and formed numerous crack lines. Seeing this, a smile was revealed on the white haired man\u2019s face when it stiffened. This was because he discovered that those crack lines had disappeared rapidly when the silver glow once again surged out from within the body of the puppet.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that I cannot break this puppet!\u201d</p><br/><p>A fierce glint flashed across the white haired man\u2019s eyes. His tongue let out a sharp cry. Frightening wind swiftly gathered. A golden light suddenly rushed over just when this punch of his was about to be unleashed. A sharp ear-piercing sound of wind being split caused the former\u2019s expression to change a little. He hurriedly pulled back.</p><br/><p>The white haired man swept his gaze around while he pulled back, only to discover that the golden light was a dark golden coloured puppet. The feeling that this puppet gave him appeared to be even more dangerous than the golden light puppet from earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis brat also possess such a puppet. No wonder he would attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>The white haired man suddenly came to an understanding when he saw the dark golden coloured Sky Demon Puppet.</p><br/><p>The white haired man hurriedly raised his head while this thought flashed across his heart, only to coincidentally see Xiao Yan slowly opening his eyes. The latter glanced at him coldly before beckoning with his hand. Those ten puppets emitted a \u2018swoosh\u2019 sound before being kept into the latter\u2019s Storage Ring.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

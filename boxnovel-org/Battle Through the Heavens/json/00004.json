The guest seemed to have something weighing on his mind, yet every time when it seemed as if he was about to broach the subject, he would swallow back the words and change the topic. Each time he did this, the delicate girl next to him would give the elder a subtle yet firm glance\u2026</p><br/><p>After listening on to their conversation for a while, Xiao Yan was bored by their conversation and his head was slowly drooping\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Xiao Yan, do you know who they are?\u201d Right when Xiao Yan was about to fall asleep from boredom, Xun Er who was beside him opened her ancient book and asked Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know?\u201d Xiao Yan curiously looked at Xun Er.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you see the symbol of a silver sword with the clouds on the cuff of their robes?\u201d Xun Er said with a light smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Xiao Yan looked towards the cuffs of the three and indeed, there he clearly saw the embroidered symbol of a sword sparkling in the clouds!</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are from the Faction of Misty Clouds?\u201d Xiao Yan asked in bewilderment.</p><br/><p>Even though Xiao Yan had never gone out into the real world, he had read from books about this faction. Xiao Yan\u2019s clan lived in a city named Wu Tan City which was part of the Jia Ma Empire. Even though this city is listed as being one of the bigger cities within Jia Ma Empire, it was still dwarfed by the size of the empire, despite having the Magic Monsters Mountain Range behind it.</p><br/><p>Within the city itself, Xiao Yan\u2019s clan was the biggest. Besides the Xiao Clan, there were two other clans that competed with the Xiao Clan, but even after 24 years of blood and strife, they were unable to overtake the Xiao clan\u2026</p><br/><p>If the Xiao Clan was the strongest power in Wu Tan City, then the Faction of Misty Clouds would be the strongest power in the entire Jia Ma Empire! The difference between the Xiao Clan and the Faction of Misty Clouds was enormous, to the point where Xiao Yan\u2019s father Xiao Zhan, who normally kept a strict and harsh face, was extremely respectful in front of these guests.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are they here?\u201d Xiao Yan whispered.</p><br/><p>Xun Er\u2019s slim fingers paused, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s related to you, Brother Xiao Yan \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMe? But I don\u2019t have any relationship with them!?\u201d Hearing Xun Er\u2019s response, Xiao Yan paused before shaking his head and whispering back.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know the name of the girl up there?\u201d Xun Er glanced at the girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, do you?\u201d Xian Yan furrowed his brows as he examined the face of the girl Xun Er pointed out. He cannot recall ever having seen her before.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s Nalan Yanran!\u201d A curious expression floated on Xun Er\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stiffened, \u201cNalan Yanran? The granddaughter of Nalan Jie, the Lionheart commander of Jia Ma Empire? She\u2019s\u2026 she\u2019s my fianc\u00e9e that was set between our families, before I was born?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, grandfather and Nalan Jie were like blood brothers and at that time, you and Nalan Yanran were born around the same time, so the two decided that you guys would get married. But, unfortunately, three years after you were born, grandfather died in a fight with a clan enemy and as time passed, Xiao Clan\u2019s relation with the Nalan family became weaker\u2026\u201d Xun Er paused and looked at Xiao Yan who was absorbed in Xun Er\u2019s story, \u201cNalan Jie is not only arrogant, he also puts extreme emphasis on promises. The marriage was decided by him so even though your name has been quite bad the past few years, he has never once thought of annulling the marriage\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat geezer sure is quite obstinate\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cNalan Jie has the final say in all matters within the family so even though he really is very fond of his granddaughter, no one in the family has stepped up to oppose the marriage\u2026\u201d Xun Er\u2019s beautiful eyes lightly glanced at Xiao Yan before continuing, \u201cBut 5 years ago, Nalan Yanran became a student under the faction leader of Misty Clouds. In these 5 years, Nalan Yanran demonstrated incredible talent. When a person has enough power to change the path of their life, they would try their hardest to change things that they don\u2019t like and unfortunately, she absolutely hates her promised marriage with brother Xiao Yan!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re saying\u2026 that she came to CANCEL the marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face darkened. At this moment he was furious, not because Nalan Yanran did not want him as her husband but rather, because Nalan Yanran is trying to cancel the marriage with the entire clan present! If that happens then his father would lose much of his dignity and respect within the clan!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly breathed in, the cold air calming his raging thoughts. Within his sleeve, Xiao Yan curled his fist, thinking, if I was a Dou Shi, who would dare to trample over my dignity?</p><br/><p>It was true, if Xiao Yan was a Dou Shi, then, even if Nalan Yanran had the backing of the Faction of Misty Clouds, she would not be able to do such a thing. A 15 year old Dou Shi,,there were only a few that had such high accomplishments in the entire history of Dou Qi Mainland. And the few people that were at that level when they were that young are now some of the most influential people in the entire Dou Qi world.</p><br/><p>A small fragile hand cleverly evaded Xiao Yan\u2019s sleeves and held onto Xiao Yan\u2019s hands. Xun Er softly said, \u201cBrother Xiao Yan, if she really cancels the marriage, then that\u2019s her own loss. I believe that in a couple of years, she will be regretting her decisions today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRegret?\u201d Xiao Yan sneered. \u201cWith my current abilities, I don\u2019t have that kind of luxury.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan paused before changing the tone of his voice, \u201cWait, Xun Er. How are you so familiar with them? The things that you\u2019ve just said, my father might not even know some of them. How do you know all these?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er stiffened but did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Looking at Xue Er\u2019s avoidance on the subject, Xiao Yan could only helplessly smile. Even though Xun Er was also part of the Xiao family, she and Xiao Yan didn\u2019t have any relation by blood. In addition, Xiao Yan had never seen Xun Er\u2019s parents and every time he asked his father about them, Xiao Zhan would shake his head and not speak. Soon, Xun Er\u2019s parents became a taboo subject, something that they seemed to fear speaking about.</p><br/><p>For Xiao Yan, Xun Er\u2019s identity was always veiled in mystery. No matter how hard or how cleverly he tried, Xun Er would always stay silent.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, whatever, if you don\u2019t want to say it then don\u2019t.\u201d Shaking his head, Xiao Yan\u2019s face suddenly darkened again. The guest elder, under the repeated signals from Nalan Yanran, finally stood up\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHeh, using the Faction of Misty Clouds to pressure father? This Nalan Yanran certainly is using some shameless tactics\u2026\u201d Fury began to build within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

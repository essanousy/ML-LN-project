She watched the green colored shadow with one knee on the ground. A long while later, a somewhat gentle smile appeared on her exquisite face. She said softly, \u201cIt has been over a year. Xiao Yan ge-ge finally arrived at that place\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>TL: ge-ge - means older brother (more intimate)</p><br/><p>Eyeing the gentle pretty face of the young lady, the green colored shadow had wisely remained silent. He waited for a long while before the sight of the former was once again focused on his body. Only then did he slowly and roughly speak about some of the experiences that Xiao Yan had during this period of time.</p><br/><p>Standing by the side of the cliff, Xun Er quietly heard the many soul stirring things that had popped out from the shadow\u2019s mouth. When she heard that Xiao Yan was seriously injured after fighting with two Dou Huang, some heartache and surprise flashed across her autumn water, gentle eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSnake Spirit Ranked Lui Man, \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019. The members of the Heaven Snake House have really become increasingly domineering during these few years\u2026\u201d Xun Er\u2019s long delicate hand gently caught a piece of leaf that had fallen from above her head as Xun Er said indiferently. The words which seemed to lack any waves had some coldness hidden in them. Regardless of whatever reason that Lui Man and the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 had acted, they had nearly caused Xiao Yan to suffer a serious injury and die. That was something true.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will hold them accountable for this matter in the future\u2026 but have you clearly investigated the identity of the Dou Huang that is by Xiao Yan ge-ge side?\u201d The green colored tree leaf was suspended half an inch from Xun Er\u2019s palm. She slowly rolled it, at times curling it and at times twisting it. She glanced at the shadow kneeling on the ground and said with slightly curled eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter an investigation, that person\u2019s name is Hai Bo Dong. He was once one of the Ten Strong in the Jia Ma Empire and was called \u2018Ice Emperor\u2019. His strength is around that of a Dou Huang class and is well versed in ice type Dou Qi. Moreover, he appears to have some deep relationship with the leader of the Primer clan\u2026 Ten years ago, he was sealed by Queen Medusa in the Tager Desert. After which, he had been living in isolation in Desert City until some time earlier when Young Master Xiao Yan visited and helped him undo the seal. After which, he has been following by Young Master Xiao Yan\u2019s side. His motive\u2026 I\u2019m still not very clear on.\u201d The green colored shadow respectfully said.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnsure of his motive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young lady\u2019s eyebrows were gently pressed together. She appeared to be somewhat dissatisfied with this perfunctory reply. Regardless of whatever happened, as long as it involved that person, she would immediately turn into a wolf that was protecting its pup, becoming extremely sensitive and picky. She would not allow such a huge and unknown danger to lie low by Xiao Yan\u2019s side like a ticking time bomb.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, my lady. You should also know that within Xiao Yan\u2019s body, there is a spirit of a mysterious strong person. Until this moment, we do not have any information about him. However, he appears to be have a great understanding of us\u2026 During the period of time that Ling Shi had followed Young Master Xiao Yan, he may have hid himself perfectly, but according to the information that Ling Shi had sent over, that mysterious strong person appeared to have discovered his presence while he was secretly protecting Xiao Yan. It is only that the other party did not have any other action. I think he should have seen past Ling Shi\u2019s intention.\u201d The green colored shadow bitterly smiled and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven Ling Shi\u2019s presence was discovered by that person?\u201d Hearing this, shock flashed across Xun Er\u2019s bright eyes. She softly muttered, \u201cWhat exactly is that person\u2019s identity? Even Ling Shi was actually\u2026 Ah, if it were not for Xiao Yan ge-ge disliking other people investigating him, I would definitely get to the bottom of that mysterious person\u2019s identity. Since he is able to possess such strength I think that he should not have been some unknown person in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough that mysterious person discovered Ling Shi\u2019s presence, it was fortunate that he did not inform Young Master Xiao Yan about it. Therefore, Young Master Xiao Yan does not know that ever since he left Wu Tan city, Young Miss has sent people to secretly protect him. However in this way, he would not be able to sense Young Miss\u2019 good...\"The green colored shadow smiled and said. However, before he managed to say all he wanted to, the somewhat embarrassed Xun Er shot the leaf on her palm to stop him.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xun Er\u2019s somewhat sleek red exquisite face, the green colored shadow wisely did not continue to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, you must not let Xiao Yan ge-ge know about this matter. I don\u2019t want him to say that I have sent someone to follow and monitor him. He does not like things like this.\u201d The lovely embarrassed sleek red on the pretty face was slowly withdrawn and Xun Er immediately reminded sternly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>The green colored shadow was naturally extremely clear of the kind of little girl thoughts that Xun Er had. He immediately nodded respectfully and responded with a \u2018yes\u2019. At the same time, his heart lamented slightly. Although the Young Miss\u2019 face had a smile all the time, the green colored shadow who understand her character knew that this kind of reserved and restrained smile was sometimes even more difficult for others to approach compared to those people who adopted a cold face.</p><br/><p>With Xun Er\u2019s beauty and shockingly outstanding training talent, there had been an unknown number of outstanding and great men who were obsessed with her during the one year since she had arrived at the Jia Nan Academy. Although these people could be considered the top strong people even in this Jia Nan Academy which was filled with talent, there was not a single person who could really converse with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh, it seems that I have forgotten someone\u2026 that fellow who was called someone whom the Jia Nan academy could only find in a hundred years\u2026 could barely be considered a man that Young Miss could put aside her acting and converse with. However, it seemed that he had only reached at this step. What a pitiful fellow. It is likely he does not have any hope in this lifetime.\u201d Recalling the young man who was so shockingly outstanding in the academy, the green colored shadow shook her head quietly in her heart. It was somewhat pitiful that this otherworldly lotus that that genius was obsessed with would only bloom for the man called Xiao Yan\u2026</p><br/><p>In the heart of the green colored shadow, he was clear that as long as Xiao Yan\u2019s name was mentioned in front of the Young Miss, Xun Er, whose character was indifferent until it was somewhat cold would remove the defensive smile that rejected people and really become a woman who was in love. That extremely rarely seen shyness and annoyance was something that those outsiders definitely did not have the luck to see.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is really a guy who causes people to be envious and jealous\u2026 I really don\u2019t know how he obtained Young Miss heart. It is really unbelievable. That haughty character of the Young Miss would actually take fancy to a man\u2026\u201d The green colored shadow sighed and shook his head, unable to understand anything. However, if he were to know that the somebody had accidentally run into the room of little girl Xun Er when he was young and had used the reason for keeping the Qi Paths warm to touch all of the little girl\u2019s body without any shame was what resulted in him inexplicably abducting the ignorant little girl, the shadow would be likely get a heart attack on the spot..</p><br/><p>\u201cThat woman called Yun Zhi should be\u2026 the leader of the Misty Cloud Sect Yun Yun, right.\u201d Uncertain about the shadow\u2019s thoughts in front of her, Xun Er, whose heart was randomly imagining things, glanced at the shadow kneeling on the ground and suddenly asked softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this question, the green colored shadow became slightly sluggish. According to the information he received, he was naturally able to know that the relationship between Xiao Yan and the lady called Yun Zhi was somewhat unnatural. At that moment, he smiled bitterly and nodded. He said, \u201cShe is indeed the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s leader, Yun Yun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although her heart already had the answer, Xun Er still could not help but sigh after it was confirmed. The expression of her face was somewhat interesting. A long while later, she shook her head and said with a bitter smile, \u201cXiao Yan ge-ge seems to be quite foolish. Aren\u2019t these things obvious? When you go to the Misty Cloud Sect in the future, I want to see how you handle this complicated relationship.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung Miss, that lady seemed to, toward Xiao Yan\u2026\u201d The green colored shadow mumbling voice had not completed his sentence when he realized that the pretty face of the young lady in front of him had became slightly still. Immediately, he hurriedly and wisely swallowed the words that had reached his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have sensed wrongly\u2026\u201d That calm and indifferent voice of the young lady had a faint resentment that could be sensed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes\u2026\u201d The green colored shadow wiped his cold sweat and hurriedly nodded. He no longer dared to bring this matter up. Although he knew that the status of the young woman in front of him was extraordinary, she was a woman regardless of how extraordinary she was. For a woman, being jealous\u2026 seemed to be a talent that could not be wiped away.</p><br/><p>\u201cPass a message to Ling Shi. Tell him to secretly protect Xiao Yan ge-ge when he goes to the Misty Cloud Sect. He has killed the First Elder of the Mo clan. Those stubborn old fellows of the Misty Cloud Sect would definitely not allow him to leave easily so that they can protect the reputation of the Misty Cloud Sect.\u201d Xun Er knit her eyebrows together and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd also pay attention to Hai Bo Dong by his side. I keep feeling that the fellow is difficult to understand. If there is any change in the situation, let Ling Shi\u2026\u201d After saying till this point, Xun Er\u2019s delicate hand gently cut through the empty air in front of her. A somewhat daunting cold and stern look was contained on her pretty face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Seeing the situation, the green colored shadow respectfully nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. According to what you have said, that \u2018Seven Colored Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 by Xiao Yan ge-ge side should be Queen Medusa, right?\u201d Xun Er said as her delicate hand pulled aside the black hair on her forehead.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, But the current Queen Medusa seems to have been suppressed by the spirit of the \u2018Seven Colored Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019. If she wants to control it again, she would have to perhaps wait for another period of time. However, once Queen Medusa controls the \u2018Seven Colored Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019s\u2019 body, then she would leap and become a Dou Zhong. When that time comes, it would be a little troublesome if she wants to kill Xiao Yan\u2026\u201d The green colored shadow voiced his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, I didn\u2019t expect that there are all these terrifying bombs placed all over Xiao Yan ge-ge\u2019s side. What a headache\u2026\u201d Xun Er helplessly shook her head as she rubbed her clean forehead. She thought for a while before saying, \u201cDuring this period of time, Queen Medusa will not be able to control the \u2018Seven Colored Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019s\u2019 body. Once Xiao Yan ge-ge arrives at the Jia Nan Academy in the future, let\u2019s then think of ways to settle all these problems\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. You should leave the Jia Nan Academy now. Don\u2019t stay here too long. If you are discovered, you would get encircled and caught by the rude and unreasonable old headmaster.\u201d After giving orders for everything, Xun Er finally waved her hand and reminded.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, that old fellow\u2019s strength is very strong. If we were to face each other head on, I would be a little inferior. However, if one were to talk about going into hiding, I am still confident.\u201d The green colored shadow smiled and nodded. He once again bowed respectfully toward Xun Er before turning around and leaping away. He actually melted into the tree beside him. The tree shook slightly and immediately became quiet\u2026</p><br/><p>Eyeing the shadow that had disappeared, Xun Er slowly turned her body around. She watched the cloud that shrouded the cliff. A moment later, she smiled warmly. Her smile was stunning.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge. Your improvement in this one year is shocking even to Xun Er\u2026 After going to the Misty Cloud Sect, you should come to the Jia Nan Academy. Xun Er is quite lonely here.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

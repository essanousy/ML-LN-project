The figure\u2019s eyes swept the distant sky before taking a glance behind him. Only then did the figure slow and mutter, \u201cBy unleashing the bone wing\u2019s ability to its limit, it is likely that even Hong Tian Xiao would be unable to catch up. Moreover, Chen Yun has been injured by both the Earth Demon Puppet and me. At the very least, he will not be able to give chase within a short period of time. Thus, he need not be overly afraid. As long as that old fellow chased him alone, he would let him try the strength of the Earth Demon Puppet!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s figure once again slowed as this thought flashed through his heart. He turned his body and looked in the distant direction of Tian Bei City. However, not a single figure appeared even after a while. Immediately, he shook his head. This old fellow was indeed cautious. He was able to maintain his rational disposition despite being so furious. It seemed that this old fellow did indeed possess great combat experience.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince he is not giving chase now, it is likely that he is waiting for Chen Yun to recover. That fellow is someone from the Wind Lightning Pavilion. He likely has access to a lot of healing medicinal pills. With his injuries, it is likely he will recover after a short period of time. Now, the most important thing is to undo the so-called Blood Lightning Seal that the old fellow planted in my body. Otherwise, my situation will be a bad once the experts from the Wind Lightning Pavilion hurry over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan swiftly made up this mind as this thought appeared. His gaze swept around him before he flapped his bone wings, and transformed into a ray of light that rushed toward a mountain range in the distance. It was likely that no one understood the thoughts within his heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan found a remote location within the mountain range and forcefully created a cave. After which, he used an enormous rock to block the entrance. The anxious Xiao Yan finally exhaled and relaxed when warm light from a Moonlight Rock scattered over the interior of the cave.</p><br/><p>\u201cI miscalculated. It is unexpected that the Wind Lightning Pavilion is so concerned about the Three Thousand Lightning Movement. Logically speaking, although the Three Thousand Lightning Movement is profound, it is merely at the Di Class Low Level.. There was no reason for this Wind Lightning Pavilion to treat an agility Dou Technique of this class as a treasure that no one can touch\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan sat cross-legged, rubbed his forehead, and bitterly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I have completely offended the Wind Lightning Pavilion, but I am not afraid. The Central Plains region is massive. Would I be afraid of not having anywhere to go? I don\u2019t believe that your Wind Lightning Pavilion\u2019s strength can spread across the entire Central Plains region.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face revealed an expression of deep thought. He immediately spread his palm and revealed a silver-white-colored Storage Ring. The Storage Ring still contained some fresh blood on it. It was the thing the Earth Demon Puppet had snatched from Chen Yun\u2019s finger earlier.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s Spiritual Strength spread out. However, the silver-white Storage Ring emitted a resistance when his Spiritual Strength made contact with it, reflecting his Spiritual Strength back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas a spiritual imprint been placed on it?\u201d Xiao Yan coldly laughed as he sensed the resistance from the Storage Ring. Spiritual Strength was one of his fortes. Though his actual level was much lower than Chen Yun\u2019s level, his Spiritual Strength was not weaker. It was not impossible for Xiao Yan to break the spiritual imprint that Chen Yun had left behind.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently inhaled a breath of air. His Spiritual Strength controlled the silver-white-colored Storage Ring, which slowly surfaced in front of him. His eyes suddenly opened and a majestic Spiritual Strength surged from between his brows like floodwater. It violently struck the Storage Ring.</p><br/><p>\u201cClang!\u201d</p><br/><p>An invisible ripple suddenly surged out of the Storage Ring the moment they collided. Finally, the ripple violently rammed the mountain wall. For a moment, the mountain cave trembled while fist-sized crack lines began to appear.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan ignored the changes in the cave as his gaze stared firmly at the trembling Storage Ring. Spiritual Strength surged out unceasingly. Finally, wave after wave struck at the spiritual imprint within the Storage Ring.</p><br/><p>The spiritual imprint that an elite Dou Zong had placed was indeed extremely strong. Regardless of what happened, however, it was merely an imprint. If the actual owner was located near this place, he would at least be able to control it from a distance. However, Chen Yun was currently rushing to heal himself. Where would he find the time to bother about the change of this spiritual imprint.</p><br/><p>The unceasing assault of Spiritual Strength continued for a couple of minutes before a slight cracking sound finally appeared in the cave.</p><br/><p>Joy instantly surged into Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes when he heard this noise. He had finally removed the spiritual imprint of that old fellow\u2026</p><br/><p>Chen Yun, who was seated cross-legged on the Sky Stone Stage in Tian Bei City, suddenly opened his tightly shut eyes when the spiritual imprint was broken. His eyes revealed a savage expression as he roared furiously, \u201cXiao Yan, the old me swears that I won\u2019t be human if I don\u2019t kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of the people had already left the Sky Stone Stage at this moment. After all, everyone could see that Hong Tian Xiao and Chen Yun were extremely furious at the moment. No one could tell whether they would be innocently implicated under the fury of these two old fellows.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you roaring for instead of quickly recuperating?\u201d Hong Tian Xiao protecting Chen Yun by the side frowned and asked in a deep voice when he saw Chen Yun act in this manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe spiritual imprint in my Storage Ring has already been broken by that little bastard!\u201d Chen Yun grit his teeth and replied.</p><br/><p>Hong Tian Xiao was startled upon hearing this. His face immediately changed a little as he said, \u201cThat brat only has the strength of a Dou Huang. How could he break your spiritual imprint? Although that puppet is strong, it clearly does not possess any Spiritual Strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Chen Yun shook his head with a gloomy face. He said in a dense voice, \u201cOnce I have fully recuperated, we will leave together. That brat has the Blood Lightning Seal that I planted in his body. He cannot escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, he has killed many people from my Hong clan. The old me will ensure that his ending won\u2019t be good.\u201d Hong Tian Xiao ferociously responded.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already dispatched news to the Wind Lightning Pavilion. It is likely that some experts will hurry over soon. At that time, that brat will have difficulty escaping!\u201d Chen Yun glanced at his hand with one missing finger. The viciousness on his face was so dense that it caused a chill to rise in one\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shut his eyes slightly as he sat in the cave, which was filled with warm light. A silver-white-colored ring in front of him was emitting a weak glow. A moment later, the glow slowly weakened and Xiao Yan gradually opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>A silver-colored scroll appeared in his hand when he opened his eyes.</p><br/><p>This silver-colored scroll was a little larger than an ordinary one. Its entire body was bright-silver. However, if one were to look at it carefully, one would discover that there were densely packed tiny red lines on it. They were just like veins that spread to every part of the scroll.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes looked at this scroll and his heart had unknowingly increased his pulse rate. This was the only somewhat strange item he had found within Chen Yun\u2019s Storage Ring.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan muttered somewhat doubtfully. He did not open it because of the strangeness of this thing. Instead, he had extended his hand and summoned the Earth Demon Puppet. He tossed the scroll to the latter. \u201cOpen it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Earth Demon Puppet receive the scroll. Its hand slowly opened it without any hesitation.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoom!\u201d</p><br/><p>The silver glow on the scroll suddenly soared after it had been opened. Immediately, a furious thunder-like explosion sounded and a thigh-thick lightningbolt shot out. It violently smashed into the chest of the Earth Demon Puppet. The powerful strength sent it flying like a cannon ball before smashing heavily into a wall. Cracks swiftly spread on the rock wall behind the puppet before they finally cracked apart with a \u2018bang.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is indeed something strange\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan coldly laughed when he saw this. If he had been the one who had received that attack, he would have been seriously injured due to his lack of defense. Fortunately, the Earth Demon Puppet had a strong physical body, and was able to receive the attack in a relaxed manner.</p><br/><p>The silver scroll slowly floated in the air after having unleashed its lightning. However, there was still a lightning glow flickering on it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes drifted over it as he beckoned with his hand. The scroll slowly descended. When it was falling, the Dou Qi in Xiao Yan\u2019s body surged and the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame transformed into a flame that wrapped around his body.</p><br/><p>The scroll did not display any unusual signs in the face of the fully armed Xiao Yan this time around. It quietly lay in his hand. Lightning flickered. It appeared like silver snakes swimming around, giving the scroll an extraordinary appearance.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief after seeing no unusual changes in the scroll. His gaze landed on the scroll, and a couple of large words that were formed by the lightning glow appeared in his sight.</p><br/><p>Three Thousand Lightning Illusionary Body. The most prized treasure of the Wind Lightning Pavilion. It was rumored to be a Dou Technique passed down from the ancient times, Di Class High Level. Once this skill is mastered, it is possible to form a lightning illusionary body. The lightning illusionary body has a similar strength to the actual body. As long as the actual body does not die, the illusionary body will not be destroyed. This god-like effect could be described in four words\u2014comparable to Tian Class!</p><br/><p>Just a short line of words caused a great storm to immediately stir within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart. An avatar with a strength similar to the actual body? Moreover, the avatar would not be destroyed as long as the actual body did not die? If this was really the case, was this so-called Three Thousand Lightning Illusionary Body not a little too terrifying. The description of it being comparable to Tian class was not an overstatement!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is unexpected that the Wind Lightning Pavilion actually possesses such a treasure. No wonder it is so strong. As long as one successfully practices it, a Dou Zun would be equivalent to two Dou Zun. When fighting with others, it would be two against one. What kind of person within the same level could defeat two equivalent enemies?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes became boiling hot as his gaze swiftly shifted a little.</p><br/><p>Behind this line of lightning glow words were some dimmer words. Clearly, this had been added by other people.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Three Thousand Lightning Illusionary Body might be frightening, but it is unusually difficult to practice. One of the requirements is that one must master the Three Thousand Lightning Movement until the highest level. During these many years, there have only been a few people throughout the Wind Lightning Pavilion who have successfully mastered it. The old me has studied it for dozens of years, but has obtained little from it. It seems that it will be hopeless in my lifetime... \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cThree Thousand Lightning Movement?\u201d Xiao Yan involuntarily inhaled a cool breath when he read until this point. He finally understood the reason Chen Yun was so deeply affected when he saw Xiao Yan display Three Thousand Lightning Movement. This thing was actually related to the most prized treasure of the Wind Lightning Pavilion.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, I must thank that old fellow. Otherwise, I would not be aware of such a secretive thing. Now that the Three Thousand Lightning Illusionary Body has landed in my hands, I will see just how difficult it is to practice it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed quietly before shutting his eyes. His Spiritual Strength invaded the silver-colored scroll that was emitting a lightning glow.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

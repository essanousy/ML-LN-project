Anyone who had heard of the name \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019 stared at the young man in the competition ground with stunned expressions. Who would have expected that this young man with such an ordinary appearance was actually able to rely on his own ability and at the very last moment, snatch back the champion spot which was about to fall into another country\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens. He was actually refining the \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019. No wonder he needed to change the flame a few times.\u201d The Little Princess involuntarily covered her mouth with her delicate hand. Her voice was filled with a shock that was difficult to hide. As an alchemist, she had a clearer understanding than the audience about just how terrifyingly difficult it was to refine and how terribly high the chances of failure were.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow was actually hiding a third type of flame?\u201d The corner of Liu Ling\u2019s mouth twitched. His eyes were filled with an astonishment that was difficult to hide. In order to refine a \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019, one needed three different types of flames. However, the flames which Xiao Yan had used earlier were merely the green colored and purple colored flame. Clearly, the latter had hid his ability until the very last moment.</p><br/><p>Since the situation had suddenly taken a dramatic turn and arrived at this moment, Little Princess and the others clearly knew that if the medicinal pill in Xiao Yan\u2019s hand was really a \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019, the champion of the Grand Meeting this time around would definitely steadily land in his hand. Although the \u2018Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill\u2019 could be consumed twice, the intense attraction of \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019 which could leap three stars forward was enough to cause anyone to be willing to take the risk!</p><br/><p>If a \u2018Two-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019 was to be compared to the \u2018Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill\u2019, it was likely that many people would choose the latter as the price they had to pay for both were the different despite a similar ability to elevate one\u2019s strength. However, if the former was changed to a \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019, the result would be entirely different. This was because the attraction of being able to leap three stars forward would cause many people to take the risk and give it a try.</p><br/><p>Although there was merely a difference of raising a person\u2019s strength by one star between the two pills, it should be known that the \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019 was also useful to a Dou Ling. On the other hand, the \u2018Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill\u2019 was merely useful to a Da Dou Shi. On this point, the latter was already much inferior to the \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019. Therefore, the \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019 would undoubtedly obtain victory when comparing between the two types of medicinal pill!</p><br/><p>Hence, Xiao Yan would be the final victor and the champion this time around!</p><br/><p>On the high platform, Fa Ma had shrunk his eyes. However, anyone could see that a smile that was difficult to hide had appeared within those eyes which were usually filled with indifferentness. Fa Ma let out a hearty laugh and once again swept his eyes over the entire open ground. He stared at the pale faced Yan Li, who was seated with his butt on the ground. With laugh, he said, \u201cI think that everyone should have heard of both the \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019 and the \u2018Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill\u2019. In that case, I don\u2019t think that I need to say anything regarding which of them is the more outstanding, do I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, since it\u2019s like this, then I will announce that the champion of the Jia Ma Empire\u2019s Alchemist Grand Meeting this season is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a moment!\u201d As he heard the voice sounding by his ears, the pale faced Yan Li suddenly lifted his head and cried out sharply.</p><br/><p>As he was being interrupted, Fa Ma frowned slightly and stared at the pale faced and red eyed Yan Li. In a cold voice, he said, \u201cDo you have something else?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that he has really refined a true \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill. I want to personally check it!\u201d Yan Li pointed his finger at Xiao Yan and shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, according to the rules of the Grand Meeting, you do not have the right to check the medicinal pill that another competitor has refined.\u201d Fa Ma shook his head and said blandly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, what if he took out another medicinal pill whose appearance was similar to a \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019 and made up the numbers? Don\u2019t tell me that you would still allow him to be the champion? Humph, looks like you are making things difficult because I am not a citizen of the Jia Ma Empire. However, there are many people in this plaza today. I think that not long later, the news of you, the Jia Ma Empire\u2019s Alchemist Association, abused your right as the organizer to prevent the examination of the medicinal pill, will spread to the entire continent. When that time comes\u2026\u201d Yan Li coldly laughed.</p><br/><p>Just as Yan Li\u2019s words fell, many people on the audience seats around the place began to whisper privately among themselves. According to common sense, this request of Yan Li was not too much to meet.</p><br/><p>TL: Now imagine if the Alchemist Association forced Yan Li to eat a pill to transform into a middle aged man</p><br/><p>Hearing the private conversations being transmitted from the surroundings, Fa Ma expression sunk. He did not expect that Yan Li was still this recalcitrant even at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce the Grand Meeting is over, it will be best if I can find a chance to\u2026 once he leaves the capital.\u201d Both of Jia Lao\u2019s hands were inserted in his sleeves as he softly muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he is able to leave the Jia Ma Empire alive, I don\u2019t need to continue being this chairman.\u201d Fa Ma\u2019s lips moved slightly. His soft voice was filled with a thick cold killing intent that was difficult to hide. It appeared that Fa Ma was truly angered by Yan Li in order for the usually good natured him to reveal his anger. \u201cWhat do we do now? Do we really let him examine it? What if Xiao Yan\u2019s medicinal pill really does have some problems? Although the chances of this are very small, the current situation doesn\u2019t allow even the slightest mistake to happen.\u201d Jia Lao hesitatingly asked.</p><br/><p>Fa Ma was silent. Although he had some confidence in Xiao Yan, it was difficult for anyone to be certain that the interior of the medicinal pill did not suffer much damage from the medicinal cauldron explosion a moment ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cChairman Fa Ma, since he needs to examine it, why don\u2019t you let him do so? Otherwise, it would appear that we are guilty.\u201d Xiao Yan suddenly raised his head and smiled at the Fa Ma\u2019s group who were full of hesitation.</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words, Fa Ma was at a lost. He eyed the smiling face and mused for a moment. Finally, he helplessly spoke, \u201cAlright. Then we will examine it. However, the person doing the examination cannot be Yan Li himself. According to the rules of the Grand Meeting, a competitor does not have the right or authority to examine the result of other people\u2019s refinements.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the procedure, a few elders in the association will be chosen. Of course, it would naturally be inappropriate for the people doing the examination to be made up of entirely members of the association. Therefore, we will also choose a few renowned grandmasters who are independant alchemists within the Jia Ma Empire and allow them to come together and examine the results of the pill refinement. Everyone, this should be sufficient to gain your trust, no?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Yan Li\u2019s expression became gloomier. Although he wanted to say something again, he forcefully controlled himself. The current him only managed to cause Fa Ma to send people to create an examination group because he had borrowed the audience to exert pressure. However, if he were to continue making things difficult, the surrounding audience would also likely be able to see through his tricks. When that time came and everyone was roused into action, the one who suffer would be himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that your medicinal pill did not suffer the slightest bit of damage after experiencing a medicinal cauldron explosion!\u201d Yan Li clenched his teeth and ferociously stared at Xiao Yan a short distance away. His manner was like a desperate hungry wolf.</p><br/><p>Not long after the rules for the examination were decided, an inspection team consisting of seven people descended from the high platform. Most of these seven people were alchemist grandmasters who had quite a great reputation in the Jia Ma Empire. They were basically around tier four. Therefore, there were hardly any objections to them becoming the inspectors.</p><br/><p>Under the observation from a countless number of gazes, the seven people slowly walked closer to the open ground. Xiao Yan swept his gaze over them and was somewhat stunned to discover that the one leading the group was actually Ao Tuo.</p><br/><p>The inspecting group first came to Yan Li\u2019s side. They took the \u2018\u2019Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill\u2019 from his hand. After which, they formed a circle and used their Spiritual Perception to probe the medicinal pill tier and to check if there were any defects.</p><br/><p>After the inspection persisted for nearly five minutes, Ao Tuo took back the medicinal pill and threw it back to Yan Li. He then raised his head and said faintly toward the seats on both sides, \u201cThe \u2018Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill\u2019 was successful refined and there were no defects!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph. Do you still need to say such unnecessary things? Hurry up and go and examine that fellow\u2019s \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019!\u201d Yan Li held the medicinal pill as he urged in an impatient manner.</p><br/><p>Ao Tuo coldly stared at him. The corner of his eyes drifted passed the \u2018Purple Heart Barrier Breaking Pill\u2019 that Yan Li held in his hand. A strange arc that no one could detect was suddenly formed from pulling at the corner of his mouth.</p><br/><p>After completely examining Yan Li\u2019s medicinal pill, Ao Tuo and the others checked all the medicinal pills that had been refined by the competitors who were willing to take them out. This included Little Princess and Liu Ling. Other than the color of their medicinal pill being not very pure, there was not too much of a problem with them.</p><br/><p>Once they had checked the medicinal pill of the Little Princess, the inspection team finally came to the front of Xiao Yan\u2019s table in front of tens of thousands pairs of eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gave Ao Tuo a smile and handed over the \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019 that was in his hand. Ao Tuo received it with both hands and softly said, \u201cVery good little fellow. You have done well.\u201d</p><br/><p>After receiving the medicinal pill, Ao Tuo\u2019s seven man team once again formed a small circle. Under everyone\u2019s gazes they took turns to carefully examine it. The expressions on their faces appeared somewhat grave.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Mo, why don\u2019t you announce the result this time around.\u201d After the medicinal pill was passed once around, it once again returned to Ao Tuo\u2019s hand. Ao Tuo suddenly smiled and spoke to an old man whose head was snow white.</p><br/><p>This old man who was addressed as Old Mo did not belong to the alchemist association, but his reputation in the Jia Ma Empire was quite great. This was because he was coincidentally the champion of one of the previous Alchemist Grand Meetings.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it is impossible not to admire him. After seeing so many Grand Meetings, this season\u2019s Grand Meeting is the most soul-stirring one.\u201d The white haired old man sighed and shook his head. He suddenly turned toward the audience seats behind him. After being silent for a moment, he finally laughed faintly, \u201cThe examination has been completed. Although it is a little embarrassing saying this, I don\u2019t mind doing so. This \u2018Three-Line Green Spirit Pill\u2019 that young friend Yan Xiao has refined has reached a perfection that even I cannot achieve.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough this little fellow is still young, his potential is limitless. I think that surpassing Gu He in the future is entirely within reach!\u201d</p><br/><p>This sudden unexpected evaluation from the white haired old man directly caused the entire open ground to instantly become totally silent. Everyone\u2019s faces were astonished as they eyed Xiao Yan whose face was similarly shocked because of the old man\u2019s evaluation. Pill-King Gu He\u2019s position within the Jia Ma Empire was nearly at the peak. In the eyes of countless fledgling alchemists, he was like a huge mountain that was insurmountable!</p><br/><p>However, at this moment, in front of tens of thousands of people, the old man had actually seriously announced that a young man who was only around twenty would surpass this huge mountain that was difficult to climb!</p><br/><p>Regardless of what the reason was, the name \u2018Yan Xiao\u2019 would from this moment forth, shake the whole Jia Ma Empire!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

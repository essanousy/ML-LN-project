The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was a Heavenly Flame that he had always dreamed of. It was ranked third on the Heavenly Flame Ranking, which proved just how strong it was. With Xiao Yan\u2019s current strength, he could rise to the peak of the Dou Zun class if he were to swallow and refine it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can it be so easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao helplessly shook his head, pouring cold water over Xiao Yan. He said, \u201cThe Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is an extremely mysterious Heavenly Flame. Even I have never personally seen it. It is already a great blessing that you have obtained three map fragments. However, it is not so easy to obtain the last map fragment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 then what is the good news that teacher has mentioned?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled before becoming slightly depressed. Even his voice had become a little weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have not obtained the final map fragment, but we have come across news related to it.\u201d Yao Lao fondled his beard and softly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s somewhat depressed mood was braced. He hurriedly inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is a special spatial trade fair held within the Central Plains every few years. An ordinary expert would not know about this spatial trade fair. Even some of the experts whose strength has reached the Dou Zong class would not be aware of it without a special channel\u2026\u201d Yao Lao grinned and said, \u201cThis is because the first qualification to participate in this spatial trade fair is that one\u2019s strength must at least reach the peak of the Dou Zong class. In other words, most of those who can participate are the true top tier experts of this continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpatial trade fair? Requires one to at least be at the peak of the Dou Zong class\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was involuntarily startled when he heard this information. After which, smacked his mouth. The entry qualification for this trade fair was indeed a little frightening. Peak of the Dou Zong class. Even top tier factions would attempt to attract these people. However, these people barely had the qualification to participate.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this so-called spatial trade fair was something that Xiao Yan had never even heard of. It was likely because of the lack of a so-called channel.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe last map fragment of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame will appear at this spatial trade fair?\u201d Xiao Yan asked while thinking things through.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye. I have some friends within the people at the spatial trade fair. I have made an inquiry this time around and coincidentally heard this information. The owner of the last map fragment is also aware that this map is related to the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. However, he plans to use it to exchange for other things since he only possesses one fragment.\u201d Yao Lao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince he is aware that this map is related to a rare object like the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame, it is likely that the prize to exchange for it will be quite great.\u201d Xiao Yan voiced his thoughts. When he obtained the map fragments in the past, the people who had obtained them from were completely unaware of their meaning. Hence, Xiao Yan had gained a great advantage. This time around someone had recognized it, making it more troublesome to obtain it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye. However, there is no other choice. This is the only news that we have obtained that is related to the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. If we do not grab ahold of it, it is likely that we will never come across the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame.\u201d Yao Lao said.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it. No matter who that person is, since this thing has appeared, I must obtain it!\u201d Xiao Yan mused for a moment before gritting his teeth to speak.</p><br/><p>The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was something Xiao Yan had coveted ever since he had obtained the first ancient map of this Heavenly Flame. He had gathered the other ancient maps after much difficulty. How could he give up now that he was lacking one map fragment that revealed the location of the flame. Moreover, Xiao Yan would be able to fight against the Hall of Souls if he possessed the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. He could kill the whatever ninth Tianzun and other top characters with one slap.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao nodded. He immediately laughed, \u201cHowever, I cannot quite remember some things because the spatial trade fair is conducted once every ten years. Quite a number of mysterious treasures appeared, and it was even possible to find a Tian class Dou Skill\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTian class Dou Skill\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s expression was a little stunned when he heard this information. His heart thought even more highly of this spatial trade fair. A Tian class Dou Skill was usually something those super factions could possess. Moreover, most of them were treasures guarded by the sect. No one could easily take it out to exchange with others. One example was the Great Heaven Creation Palm that Xiao Yan had obtained. If he had not been lucky, he would not have obtained it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much longer until the spatial trade fair begins?\u201d Xiao Yan frowned and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s less than a year left\u2026\u201d Yao Lao counted the time and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t be for a long time, huh\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan knit his brows even more tightly. The current him could not help but wish to find the person who possessed the final ancient map. Regardless of what method he had to use, he needed to obtain that ancient map.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, there is no choice. If you anxiously require a Heavenly Flame, you can see if there has been news of any other Heavenly Flames or perhaps snatch it from those who have one. I wonder which faction on the continent, other than the Burning Flame Valley, possesses the most Heavenly Flames.\u201d Feng zun-zhe by the side joked.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan bitterly smiled. How could it be so easy to find something like a Heavenly Flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe faction with the most Heavenly Flames in this world is likely the Yan clan.\u201d Yao Lao smiled and suddenly informed them.</p><br/><p>\u201cYan clan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this answer. What faction was this? Why had he never heard of it?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is one of the eight ancient clans and one of the hidden factions. Its strength is far beyond your imagination. The Central Plains is not as simple as it seems on the surface. The so-called One Hall One Tower, Two Sects Three Valleys, Four Pavilions is merely a general form of address. Some true top factions are hidden even more deeply than the Gu clan.\u201d Yao Lao faintly explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cEight ancient clans?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart pounded when he heard this term again. He hesitated for a moment before asking, \u201cJust which clans are these eight ancient clans?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao was quiet for a moment. Only then did he reply, \u201cThe Gu clan and Hun (Soul) clan belong to the eight ancient clans\u2026 other than those two clans, there are still five other clans that still exist. They are the Yan clan, Yao clan, Shi clan, Lei clan, and Ling clan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily inhaled a gentle breath of cold air when he heard these names that he had never heard before. This world did indeed exceed his expectations. Originally, he thought that the Hall of Souls was the strongest. It was unexpected that they were merely one of the so-called eight ancient clans.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that there are only seven clans?\u201d Xiao Yan was quiet for a moment before suddenly inquiring.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao stared at Xiao Yan. A moment later, he said, \u201cThere is still one ancient clan that has been abandoned, the Xiao clan, which is your current Xiao family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly exhaled a breath of air. It was as though he wanted to exhale the many distractions within his heart. He had never imagined that the Xiao clan, located in the corner and only surviving in a second rate city within the Jia Ma Empire, possessed a legendary origin that even he could not have imagined.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan was not aware of how powerful this so-called Xiao clan was, it naturally possessed a monstrous strength in order to contend against a faction like the Hun (Soul) clan and the Gu clan. However, the Xiao clan, which had been prominent once, had already been eliminated by merciless time.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Xiao clan had once produce a Dou Di. Hence, the descendants of that line possessed the bloodline of a Dou Di. However, this kind of bloodline only reached the generation of your ancestor Xiao Xuan before being used by him\u2026\u201d Yao Lao slowly explained. \u201cThe bloodline of a Dou Di might be powerful, but it does not last forever. There is a time when it will run out. To continue preserving the bloodline, another Dou Di needs to appear and provide the bloodline with energy and life\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately, the Xiao clan has never groomed an elite Dou Di ever since that Dou Di of the Xiao clan. The strongest is merely your ancestor Xiao Xuan. Similarly, his act of staking it all, putting in everything, was still not enough to rescue this declining clan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy now, the so-called Dou Di bloodline of the Xiao clan has gone to waste. I have never sensed even the slightest Dou Di bloodline in your body after so many years. Perhaps you should also be clearly aware of this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan quietly nodded. During these years of training, he had relied on himself during the critical life and death moment in order to breakthrough. His Dou Di bloodline was completely useless.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, there is no need to feel any burden in your heart because you don\u2019t need the Dou Di bloodline with your strength. Teacher believes that you will sooner or later rebirth the abandoned Dou Di bloodline of the Xiao clan.\u201d Yao Lao patted Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulder and spoke with gentle eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly smiled. What could the Dou Di bloodline do? With his current achievement, he was not the least bit afraid even if he met the young experts from the ancient clans, who possessed the bloodline of a Dou Di. The only gap between the two of them was just how much effort they put in, but everyone understood that the process was unimportant. The most important thing was the result!</p><br/><p>Nobody was concerned about whether one\u2019s training journey was smooth or bumpy. All people look at was one\u2019s final achievement!</p><br/><p>Yao Lao nodded in a pleased manner when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s expression. This disciple was the best choice regardless if it was in terms of talent or character. Although, he had been immature, the current him had returned to his simple and less haughty state. This continent will sooner or later remember his name forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does teacher understand these eight ancient clans so well? Wouldn\u2019t an ordinary person find it difficult to learn such information, right?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly landed on Yao Lao as he smiled and asked a pointed question.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, cunning fellow, you have guessed something, huh\u2026\u201d Yao Lao was startled before he replied with a grin.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes teacher and that so-called Yao clan have any relation?\u201d Xiao Yan softly inquired.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao held a teacup in his hand. A faint smile appeared on his elderly face. However, this smile contained a sadness and a bitterness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am indeed a member of the Yao clan. However\u2026 I belonged to the type abandoned by the clan\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

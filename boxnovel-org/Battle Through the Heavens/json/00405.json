In the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019, the name of the \u2018Death Spirit Tree\u2019 had nearly already reached a stage where one would tremble with fear just from hearing its name. Many of the people, who had lived in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 for some years, would not forget the deadly and bloody battle between the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 and Jia Nan Academy. There weren\u2019t many people who really paid much attention to the reason for why that bloody battle began . The only thing that people knew was after that bloody battle, the corpses of two strong Dou Wangs and one Dou Huang were hung on this \u2018Death Spirit Tree\u2019 with a incomparably cruel method\u2026</p><br/><p>From that day on, the area around Jia Nan Academy descended into a quiet region that was incomparable with the outside world. There were no longer any strong people from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 who dared to carry a face filled with killing intent and charge into these small towns. Even though there were a few riots, the people who were involved in it would become a corpse which was fixed onto the \u2018Death Spirit Tree\u2019 within an hour.</p><br/><p>During these years, the notoriety of the \u2018Death Spirit Tree\u2019 had nearly spread throughout the entire \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. Therefore even those diabolical people seldom had the courage to enter this place, which was like digging their own grave.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stood at the entrance of the small town and inhaled a deep breath of air. The chillness in his heart was banished. He ignored those people, who hesitated and didn\u2019t dare to enter the town, and lifted his foot before stepping into this \u2018Peace Town\u2019, which represented the entrance into Jia Nan Academy.</p><br/><p>The moment when Xiao Yan\u2019s footstep had just stepped into the \u2018Peace Town\u2019, he sensed a strange undulation sweeping through him.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the undulation which carried the taste of an inspection, Xiao Yan raised his head and eyed the street of the small town. There were quite a number of people on the street, with various different stalls placed on either side. Some children were shuttling about as they played roughly and laughed. This serene atmosphere of harmony was too drastic of an appearance from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019.</p><br/><p>Those people on the street naturally discovered Xiao Yan, who had walked in through the entrance of the town. Although their eyes had a cautious light to them, they did not have an overly frightened reaction.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze swept over the street. He was just about to step onto it, when his heart suddenly moved. As he lifted his head and threw his gaze toward the rooftops of the houses in the town, only to see more than ten shadows briskly rushing toward the direction of the town\u2019s entrance like monkeys.</p><br/><p>A moment later, over ten human figures flashed and appeared at the small town\u2019s main entrance. Their gazes swept across Xiao Yan and the others. Among them, a middle-aged man, who was presumably the leader, said faintly, \u201cAnyone who wants to enter \u2018Peace Town\u2019 must report their identity, name, etc. Otherwise, they will be directly expelled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes drifted across these ten plus human figures. He realized that other than the middle-aged man, who was the leader, there were male and females among the other ten plus people present. However, they were all very young. From their appearances, they appeared to be around twenty two or twenty three years old.</p><br/><p>These young people were wearing the same pale-blue-colored clothes. Additionally, they wore an azure-colored badge on the chest area of their clothes. Within the badge was a dagger that was contaminated with some bright-red, liquid blood.</p><br/><p>At this moment, these ten plus young people were using an alert and faint discriminating gaze as they stared at Xiao Yan and the rest.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdditionally, after you have reported your name and identity, you will consume this medicinal pill.\u201d The middle-aged man waved his hand, and a bottle of pale-red medicinal pills appeared in his hand. He carelessly glanced at everyone people who had just arrived from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 whose expressions had changed slightly as he coldly spoke, \u201cRest assured that this is not some poison. It is a medicinal pill refined by the alchemist department in the academy that senses killing intent. If you all possess killing intent within your hearts while you are within the academy\u2019s borders, this medicinal pill will emit a red glow from within your bodies. Our Law Enforcement Unit will follow this red glow and come searching for you. You should all know how our Jia Nan Academy deals with those who bring the practices of the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 into this place\u2026 Before you all plan to leave the small town, you can go to the heart of the town to obtain the antidote. However, once the antidote is in your hands, there will be the Law Enforcement Unit supervising you all the way out of the town.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they heard the words of the middle-aged man, the faces of the people at the entrance of the town could not help but change. With their sensitive nerves from frequently living on a knife\u2019s edge, how was it possible for them to swallow an unknown medicinal pill? Was that not equivalent to putting their lives into another person's hands?</p><br/><p>However, just as some unruly people could not resist wanting to retort, the ten plus men and women behind the middle-aged man immediately let out a choking sound. They then drew the longswords that they carried on their waists in an orderly manner. Dou Qi of different colors seeped out from within their bodies as they finally pointed the tip of their swords toward the entrance of the town. They clearly had the thought of directly attacking and expelling those people, should there be any disagreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe rules of the \u2018Peace Town\u2019 have always been like this. If you don\u2019t want to, then don\u2019t enter. Otherwise, if you enter and go against the rules, there might be more decorations to hang on the \u2018Death Spirit Tree\u2019.\u201d The middle-aged man held out his hand as he spoke indifferently. As his words fell, a powerful force slowly began seeping out from within his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person\u2019s strength should be at least above a seven star Da Dou Shi\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan softly muttered as he sensed the powerful force originating from the middle-aged man.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the other party did not ease up, a fierce air involuntarily surged onto the faces of the people at the entrance of the town. However, when the corner of their eyes drifted toward the \u2018Death Spirit Tree\u2019 at the side, their entire bodies trembled as they felt a chill. The fierce aura, which they had just brewed, disappeared immediately and completely. They gritted their teeth and some people, who were still unwilling to swallow the medicinal pill, helplessly left.</p><br/><p>As those people left, the remaining ones could only enter despite being unwilling. After which, they walked toward the middle-aged man and reported their names, took a pale-red medicinal pill and swallowed it in front of the Law Enforcement Unit.</p><br/><p>The middle-aged man\u2019s indifferent expression only became slightly less dark when he eyed those people obediently swallowing the medicinal pill. However, he appeared to look badly upon everyone from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. Therefore, he did not display any nice expressions from beginning to end.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 do the students of the academy need to eat this thing?\u201d A young man in front of the middle-aged man suddenly asked when the latter habitually handed the medicinal pill to the former.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh?\u201d When they heard these words, the surrounding people, as well as the ten plus members of the Law Enforcement Unit, cast their stunned gazes over. As he eyed the young man\u2019s delicate and handsome face, the middle-aged man asked with a face filled with doubt, \u201cYou say that you are a student of this academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, after I passed the student recruitment test, I took leave for a period of time. Therefore, I could only come by myself\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders, smiled and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have passed through the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 by yourself in order to come here?\u201d The middle-aged man was immediately blank when he heard this. His face was filled with shock. It should be known that usually, the new students of the academy would be escorted by some people sent by the academy all the way in after arriving just outside of the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. After all, a group of new students, who had just left their cottage, might not even be able to walk out of the Great Plains of the Black Region before they were finished off by a countless number of hidden knives. Afterall,this kind of chaotic place was somewhere people were eaten with their bones.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan simply smiled and nodded his chin slightly when faced with the strange gazes of the middle-aged man and the ten plus young male and females behind.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Xiao Yan nodded his head, the astonishment in the middle-aged man\u2019s eyes became even more abundant. His gaze swept up and down Xiao Yan as he said, \u201cReport your name, age, and recruitment instructor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, eighteen, instructor\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan blinked his eyes. The mature woman who was as gentle as soft water back then surfaced in his mind. He could not help but say with a smile, \u201cInstructor Ruo Ling.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEighteen years old? You dare to cross the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 at only eighteen years old? Little fellow, regardless of whether you are speaking the truth, it is the first time that I have seen anyone with such boldness.\u201d The middle-aged man waved his hand. He was just about to turn around and instruct the people to investigate, when the expression of a young person, whose eyebrows were knit tightly together as he bitterly thought of something, changed abruptly. He cried out involuntarily, \u201cXiao Yan? Don\u2019t tell me that you are that Xiao Yan from the Jia Ma Empire who had taken two years of leave in one go?\u201d</p><br/><p>The involuntary cry of the young person caused the people around him to be blank. Immediately, their faces were filled with a sudden understanding. They threw a somewhat strange gaze at Xiao Yan. Everyone in the academy had heard of the name of this thorn-like student who had taken two years of leave before he even entered the academy in this one year. Of course, the reason for Xiao Yan\u2019s name being able to be deeply rooted within the hearts of the people at the Jia Nan Academy was naturally because he had a great relationship to Xun Er...</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan? That Xiao Yan ge-ge of junior Xun Er?\u201d After the few young people were stunned for a moment, there was suddenly an additional unknown meaning within the gaze they used to look at Xiao Yan. This kind of expression was something that Xiao Yan had once seen in Young Master Jia Lie\u2019s eyes back at Wu Tan City.</p><br/><p>TL: ge-ge - older brother or an older male friend (latter meaning is used by females in an affectionate manner</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, this girl\u2026 I haven\u2019t even come to the academy but she ended up creating all these inexplicable love rivals for me?\u201d Xiao Yan was immediately ammused as he eyed the expressions in the young men\u2019s eyes. In his heart, he felt neither able to laugh nor cry as he shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are speaking about the Xiao Yan from Wu Tan City of the Jia Ma Empire, then it should be me.\u201d Xiao Yan spread out his hands at the middle-aged man, whose face was similarly surprised as he spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should first come with us to the administrative office to check the records. If what you said is true, you don\u2019t need to consume this thing. Oh right, I am called Huo De and I am the section leader of the second section of the Jia Nan Academy Law Enforcement Unit and also a Huang class instructor at the academy.\u201d When Xiao Yan had mentioned the name Wu Tan City, the middle-aged man believed him a little more. However, in order to be safe, he still needed to have Xiao Yan follow him to the academy administrative office in the town.</p><br/><p>\u201cInstructor Huo De.\u201d Xiao Yan greeted him. After seeing Huo De nodding his head, Xiao Yan followed him under the strange gazes of the ten plus Law Enforcement Personnel.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, is that fellow really Xiao Yan?\u201d The ten plus academy\u2019s Law Enforcement Personnel eyed Xiao Yan\u2019s back as they followed at a distance, neither far nor near, behind Huo De. They could not help but begin to engage in private conversations.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like it should be the truth. He does not seem to be very handsome. Why does Junior Xun Er constantly think of him? She even directly rejected being wooed by our head because of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should not really underestimate this Xiao Yan. Being able to charge into the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 alone and safely arrive here is sufficient to explain something. At the very least, if we were to have a short stay of ten days to half a month within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019, I dare not guarantee that my hands and feet would still be safe and sound.\u201d A young man, whose face was ordinary, stared at Xiao Yan\u2019s back, then glanced at his companions as he said faintly.</p><br/><p>This ordinary looking young man appeared to have quite a great reputation in the Law Enforcement Unit. Therefore, when the other ten plus members of the Law Enforcement Unit were startled when they heard these words of him. They also nodded silently. As the first small town, which came into contact with the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019, they had seen many of those lunatics from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 everyday.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

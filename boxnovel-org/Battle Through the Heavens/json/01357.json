Saint Xue Dao\u2019s eyes were frightened as he stared at Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead. His voice actually contained some fear.</p><br/><p>The Great Heaven Creation Palm, which was swiftly gathering in Xiao Yan\u2019s palm, also paused because of the strange actions of Saint Xue Dao. Xiao Yan frowned, and his toes pressed on the ground as his body swiftly withdrew. He demanded, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Saint Xue Dao\u2019s eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan\u2019s brows. The partially visible clan tattoo that had surfaced at that spot earlier had completely vanished. However, his heart clearly understood that this clan tattoo was definitely familiar to him because this clan tattoo appeared as frightening as the devil in his distant memory.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t all the members of the Xiao clan die\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Saint Xue Dao muttered. His eyes involuntarily swept to the deepest part of the Heavenly Tomb when he uttered these words. A deep fear flashed across his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Gu Qing Yang, Xun Er, and the rest also rushed to Xiao Yan\u2019s side at this moment. They looked at Saint Xue Dao, who had suddenly stopped attacking, as they asked with soft voices full of doubt.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not certain\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head, but he did not abandon the caution in his heart. The strength of an elite Ban Sheng was too powerful. Even with many of them joining hands, it would still be extremely difficult to deal with him. If they were careless, it was even possible for their entire group to die here.</p><br/><p>Gu Qing Yang also frowned when he heard this. This Saint Xue Dao might only be an energy body, but it still possessed an intelligence and memories from when it was alive. Just what had caused him to feel such fear?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little fellow is actually a member of that Xiao clan\u2026 given the incredible abilities of that person, he has definitely sensed him entering. If I kill him, I will have difficulty escaping that person\u2019s murderous desire in the future.\u201d Saint Xue Dao\u2019s eyes rapidly flickered. A moment later, the bloody aura that spread over his body was slowly withdrawn. His hand was swung and the scimitar disappeared. He glanced at Xiao Yan and ordered him somewhat unwillingly, \u201cGo! Consider yourself lucky this time around!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s group was stunned to hear his words. They exchanged glances with each other. They did not understand why this fellow had suddenly changed his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWalk west from here. This narrow path is where many experts gather. You should be able to avoid most of them if you walk to the west and you will then reach your destination.\u201d Saint Xue Dao spoke somewhat impatiently when he saw everyone\u2019s flabbergasted expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much elder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan exchanged glances with Gu Qing Yang and the rest. After which, he hurriedly cupped his hands respectfully to Saint Xue Dao. Subsequently, they slowly stepped back. The Dou Qi in their bodies remained in a state where it could erupt at any time. Only after having withdrawn by over a hundred meters and seeing that Saint Xue Dao did not do anything, they sighed in relief within their hearts. They quickly turned around and rushed deeper.</p><br/><p>Saint Xue Dao watched Xiao Yan\u2019s group as they left quickly. Only then did he curl his mouth. His eyes looked wandered to the deepest part of the Heavenly Tomb as he muttered to himself, \u201cHmph, you owe me a favor this time around. You should at least let me off when you come and clear up the place in the future, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat fellow\u2026 he is really strange. Earlier, he was filled with a desire to kill, but then he suddenly turned into a nice person in the blink of an eye\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The energy fog spread over the land. A couple of figures shuttled by. Gu Hua glanced behind him before speaking with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe seems to have been able to identify that I am a member of the Xiao clan\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes were cautiously sweeping around him as he randomly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cEach time your aura soars, the clan tattoo of the Xiao clan appears on your forehead. He is a former top expert. How can he not recognize it\u2026\u201d Gu Qing Yang smiled and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s body paused when he heard this. He turned his head with a surprised face and asked, \u201cWhat clan tattoo do I have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d Gu Qing Yang\u2019s group were also surprised when they saw that Xiao Yan appeared even more at a loss compared to them. Gu Qing Yang said, \u201cThis clan tattoo seems to only be able to appear temporarily. It disappears pretty quickly\u2026 reasonably speaking, you should not even possess a clan tattoo. A clan tattoo relies on the strength of the bloodline to be activated. However, the strength of the Xiao clan\u2019s bloodline has been completely exhausted\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan frowned. How could he understand it himself? His forehead had a flame imprint on it, and this flame mark had gradually paled after he successfully swallowed the Bone Chilling Flame. As for that whatever clan tattoo, he had definitely never seen it before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen my aura is soaring, I am using the Skyfire Three Mysterious Change. However, what has that got to do with the clan tattoo of my Xiao clan?\u201d Numerous mysteries flashed through Xiao Yan\u2019s mind, but he did not find the slightest answer. This caused his frown to tighten.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Saint Xue Dao from earlier is not afraid of the Xiao clan tattoo. This thing does not possess even the slightest strength\u2026\u201d A thought flew through Xiao Yan\u2019s heart. \u201cThe reason that he had let us off is likely due to something else. Moreover, this thing should be related to the clan tattoo of the Xiao clan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, just what was related to the Xiao clan tattoo in the Heavenly Tomb that could deter Saint Xue Dao, who possessed the strength of a Ban Sheng?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s Xiao Xuan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er by the side suddenly came to an answer. Xiao Yan was still fine when these words were uttered. However, a chilled aura seeped from under the feet of Gu Qing Yang\u2019s group. Xiao Xuan had already died for so many years. How could he still terrify this Saint Xue Dao?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Heavenly Tomb is extremely mysterious. Since an elite Ban Sheng like Saint Xue Dao can survive through any means and possess his spirit from when he was alive, could elder Xiao Xuan, who reached the peak of the Dou Sheng class, also rely on this method to survive?\u201d Xun Er slowly explained her reasoning.</p><br/><p>Gu Qing Yang\u2019s group was speechless. Their eyes immediately turned to Xiao Yan. Although Xiao Yan\u2019s expression remained calm, they could still sense that his heart was fluctuating intensely at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. All of these mysteries will be solved when we reach our destination\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan softly replied. The speed of their bodies suddenly increased. He transformed into a blurry black line that charged into the faint energy fog. Xun Er and the others exchanged gazes behind him before quickly following.</p><br/><p>During the subsequent journey, Xiao Yan\u2019s group followed the path that Saint Xue Dao had pointed out to them. The energy bodies they were sensing had become much stronger. There were some who were even stronger than Saint Xue Dao. However, it was fortunate that Xiao Yan\u2019s group had avoided the scanning of these experts by following the gaps between the energy bodies territories. Thus, they were not hindered along the way\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should have truly entered the deepest region of the Heavenly Tomb\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s group relied on the chaotic rocky terrain to hide themselves. They rested for a moment before Gu Qing Yang looked at the deepest darkest part and voiced his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed worthy of being the most dangerous place. The surrounding energy bodies appear to be too frightening. Even the nine star energy bodies can only be a guard....\u201d Gu Hua bitterly laughed. Being in a place where numerous experts were located, they finally discovered just how weak they were. They were existences that many young clan members of the Gu clan looked up to in the Gu Realm. Here, however\u2026 they seemed to be ant-like existences. They needed to be careful even when they spoke.</p><br/><p>The others could only helplessly smile when they heard his words. This place was not a place that they should have come to. Being able to reach this far had already exceeded their expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on our speed, we should reach the tomb of Xiao Xuan that is recorded in the ancient books very soon\u2026\u201d Xun Er looked at Xiao Yan and softly informed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis path is still quite smooth. It looks like that Saint Xue Dao has given us a lot of help. However, this place is indeed too dangerous. We should get moving soon\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan nodded and immediately urged.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><br/><p>The others agreed with these words. They hurriedly stood up.</p><br/><p>When they had just got up and prepared to once again hurry on their journey. However, a slight rushing wind sound had suddenly appeared in front of them. Immediately, two black figures slowly landed on a large rock. They overlooked everyone from above. Their eyes contained a mockery like a cat playing with a mouse.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, your speed is really a little too slow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of Xiao Yan\u2019s group suddenly changed when they heard this dangerous laughter. They suddenly raised their heads and looked at the two figures in the distance. Their faces sank a little. \u201cHun Ya, Hun Li!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, I wondered who it was. It is actually you two homeless dogs, who had fled before. Why do you have the courage to appear now?\u201d Gu Hua unceremoniously ridiculed the two figures when he saw them.</p><br/><p>The gloomy-faced Xiao Yan quietly gave a hand signal when Gu Hua uttered these words. The Hun Ya duo had been hiding from them. Given their strength, where would they get the guts to openly appear in front of Xiao Yan\u2019s group. Anything out of the ordinary definitely meant that something was wrong. Since these two had dared to appear, it was likely that they had something to rely on.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, the ones who will be homeless strays this time around will definitely be you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Ya strangely smiled in the face of Gu Hua\u2019s ridicule, and then Hun Li and him slowly withdrew. When they withdrew, two gray-clothed sinister-looking old fellows quietly appeared in front of them in a ghost-like manner\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDou Sheng?\u201d</p><br/><p>An indescribable feeling of danger immediately rose within their hearts when they saw these two gray-clothed old men appear!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

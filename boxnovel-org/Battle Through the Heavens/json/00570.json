Xiao Yan had been extremely curious of this expert who was ranked in front of Liu Qing. Li Xiuya had been unable to display the sharpness that was associated with his rank deep in the mountains since his opponent was a Dou Wang class Magical Beast and he was busy dodging the entire time. However, from the looks of how he could still jump around in such a lively manner after receiving such a heavy blow from the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape,\u2019 which had awoken its wild and violent bloodline, it seemed that the strength of this fellow belonged to a frightening group.</p><br/><p>The appearance of Lin Xiuya was undoubtedly one of the few highlights of today\u2019s competition. Moreover, his popularity within the Inner Academy was something that even Liu Qing could not compare with. His normally approachable, warm manner made it extremely easy to let others get a good feeling about him. Even someone as tenacious as Xiao Yan had difficulty forming any enmity toward him. Therefore, as he entered the arena, the surrounding viewing gallery started emitting a deafening cheer. The faces of some female students also became flushed as their gazes carried embarrassment and joy while looking at the green-clothed, young man who was standing straight and tall in the arena.</p><br/><p>If one said that everyone in the Inner Academy held fear and respect for Lin Xiuya and Liu Qing, it was likely that they felt more respect for the former and a greater amount of fear for the latter.</p><br/><p>The completely different auras emitted by both of them decided how welcomed they were.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan leaned against the guardrail. His gaze had some interest as he eyed Lin Xiuya in the arena who was smiling in all directions. Xiao Yan\u2019s heart also contained anticipation.</p><br/><p>Lin Xiuya\u2019s opponent arrived not long after the former entered the arena. He was a peak expert who was ranked 13th on the \u2018Strong Ranking\u2019... however, this expert had a bitter expression similar to what Liu Qing\u2019s opponent had earlier today. Given his level, it was not considered too difficult for him to enter the top ten if he had some good luck. Unfortunately, now that he had drawn a lot that caused him to meet Lin Xiuya, a tiger that blocked his road, he basically had no chance of entering the top ten.</p><br/><p>There was not much suspense in this battle since the beginning. Although Xiao Yan hoped that the expert who was ranked 13th on the \u2018Strong Ranking\u2019 would be able to force Lin Xiuya to quietly reveal some of his true ability, things did not go the way he desired. Even after the latter displayed all his strength to save himself, Lin Xiuya still maintained his indifferent manner. His green garment flattered as his long clean hands, which seemed to belong to that of a female, repeatedly tightened their grip. Occasionally, both of his palms would form a strange shape.</p><br/><p>Lin Xiuya\u2019s opponent was powerless against Lin Xiuya\u2019s hands. They remained close to the former's body like a maggot in the tarsal bones. No matter how the former struggled, his attacks were ultimately restricted by his opponent\u2019s hands. Additionally, he did not actually manage to touch Lin Xiuya\u2019s clothes from the start to the finish.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes as he eyed Lin Xiuya\u2019s soft snake-like body from the tall platform, which extended and withdrew freely. By relying on the terrain, he was able to clearly absorb the situation of the fight in his eyes. Hence, Xiao Yan was extremely certain that Lin Xiuya\u2019s strange pestering hand attack should be a kind of extremely strong close range Dou Technique.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, Liu Qing has his two ultimates, one claw one lance. Being able to surpass him by one level, Lin Xiuya naturally has ultimate skills that are not inferior to those two.\u201d Lin Yan\u2019s voice suddenly appeared behind Xiao Yan. He smiled proudly when he saw Xiao Yan turning his head to look over, \u201cDo you want to know what they are?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me if you want to.\u201d Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders and spoke indifferently. Being clearly aware of Lin Yan\u2019s character, this fellow would purposefully refuse to say anything if one were to act curious at this moment.</p><br/><p>As expected, Lin Yan merely helplessly shook his head when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s careless manner. He walked forward. His hands grabbed the guardrail as he eyed the one-sided battle below. He smiled and said, \u201cOne pester and one strong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne pester and one strong?\u201d Xiao Yan lifted his brows and softly muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Xiuya has practiced a kind of strange Dou Technique, \u2018Pestering Snake Hand\u2019. It is just like what you have seen. He is able to use this Dou Technique to completely suppress all your attacks within an extremely small area. Someone with weaker strength would basically be toyed with by him until their attacks would move with his wish.\u201d Lin Yan clicked his tongue and spoke with some amazement, \u201cThis \u2018Pestering Snake Hand\u2019 and Liu Qing\u2019s \u2018Great Rift Coffin Splitting Claw\u2019 are completely different. If the latter is said to be incomparably strong and tough, this \u2018Pestering Snake Hand\u2019 belongs to the type that uses gentle force to subdue a tough one. I have fought with him a couple of times but I was strangely battered by that \u2018Pestering Snake Hand\u2019. If one were to discuss the degree of formability, this \u2018Pestering Snake Hand\u2019 is even stronger than the \u2018Great Rift Coffin Splitting Claw\u2019 of Liu Qing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. His eyes glanced at the arena below and had indeed discovered that as Lin Xiuya moved, his snake-like body was strangely agile. Once those hands were stuck to you, it would likely not be an easy task to escape from them.</p><br/><p>\u201cSticky candy\u2026\u201d The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth moved, and gave Lin Xiuya\u2019s Dou Technique an appropriate name.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about that so-called one strong?\u201d Xiao Yan softly asked as his eyes flickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, I am also not very certain about this one. That \u2018one strong\u2019 of Lin Xiuya is much like Liu Qing\u2019s spear. Very few people are able to cause them to use those attacks. However, according to my reasoning, it should be a kind of extremely powerful sword Dou Technique. I have heard rumors that it is very strong\u2026 Back then, even Liu Qing was defeated by this move. After so many years have passed, I think that so-called \u2018one strong\u2019 is even more frightening.\u201d Lin Yan rubbed his head and laughed awkwardly. There was an anticipation in his tone after his words sounded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded and sighed, \u201cHe is indeed worthy of being an expert in the Inner Academy, only weaker than Zi Yan. Even though he hid his killing move, an ordinary person was still unable to contend with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is nothing to be surprised about. Other than a small number of special people, these two people are from the oldest batch of students within the Inner Academy. It is not surprising that they possess such achievements. You, on the other hand, just entered the Inner Academy less than a year ago, yet you already possess the strength to squeeze into the top ten. If one were to talk about it, you are the greatest monster. I think that if you are given enough time, even that \u2018Brute Strength Queen\u2019 would not be your match.\u201d Lin Yan glanced at Xiao Yan somewhat strangely. His eyes repeatedly looked in all directions when he spoke the last few words, seemingly afraid that the \u2018Brute Force Queen\u2019 would suddenly appear.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed and said, \u201cForget it, I don\u2019t wish to obtain Zi Yan\u2019s position. Otherwise, if I were to anger her, I would not feel well because I would receive a punch from her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Yan shrugged his shoulders and said, \u201cYou are able to sense how much Liu Qing and Lin Xiuya view you seriously. I think that even if they didn\u2019t speak it aloud with their mouths, they are very surprised at your current achievement given such an age.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and softly said, \u201cI will not stay for long in this place. The Inner Academy is merely a temporary stop\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because of the matter of that clan of yours? Hee hee, I have also gained some information about you from the mouths of some Elders.\u201d The gaze which Lin Yan eyed Xiao Yan with had suddenly become a lot hotter. That heat even had a hint of reverence to it. \u201cChallenging a sect with an elite Dou Zong all by yourself and managing to leave safely after that. I really don\u2019t know how an incredible person like you managed to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was slightly startled before he immediately came to a sudden comprehension. With the strength of Jia Nan Academy, it was likely that it had obtained information about him the first day he entered the academy. Moreover, the matter of him challenging the Misty Cloud Sect had already become extremely well known within the Jia Nan Academy. Anyone would be able to know about it just by random inquiry.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled, but he did not wish to say anything on this topic.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to my timeline, I might become an Elder and stay within the Inner Academy for one year if I enter the top ten. If you wish to return to the Jia Ma Empire at that time and don\u2019t resent the company, I will follow you around a little. After all, roaming the continent is something in my future plans.\u201d Lin Yan patted Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders and laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan raised his head and eyed the smiling face of Lin Yan by his side in a stunned manner. A moment later, he nodded his head somewhat joyfully. With Lin Yan\u2019s strength, it was likely that he would enter the Dou Wang class sooner or later. An expert Dou Wang could be considered quite valuable even in the continent, much less within the Jia Ma Empire. The break out of a clash between the Misty Cloud Sect and himself in the future was unavoidable. If he were to gather some truly strong people by his side, it would be much more relaxing when he decides to make his move against the Misty Cloud Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will definitely call you at that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the two of them conversed, the fight within the arena gradually approached its end. This battle was basically in Lin Xiuya\u2019s control right from the beginning until the end. His gentle snake-like hands adhered to his opponent until the latter felt dazzled and confused. Hence, this battle carried a little amusement, but ended after lasting for around ten minutes.</p><br/><p>When Lin Xiuya\u2019s hand quietly pressed on his opponent\u2019s chest, a gentle force suddenly erupted. At that point, everyone knew that this battle had already reached the expected end result.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. There is nothing much to see in the subsequent battles.\u201d Lin Yan waved his hand at Xiao Yan while eying Lin Xiuya\u2019s opponent, who had been knocked out of the arena below. He took the lead to turn around and walk out of the stadium. As he walked, he said, \u201cNow, let\u2019s just wait for the fight for the top ten tomorrow. However, I don\u2019t know which unlucky three fellows will be eliminated\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. His gaze was thrown into the arena. Coincidentally, Lin Xiuya\u2019s gaze was also thrown over. The two gazes intertwined in mid-air. They smiled to each other but those smiles respectively contained some anticipation and passion within them. Clearly, the two people also had great respect for each other. This was perhaps because of the connection between strong people, allowing them to understand one another. Although the strength of Xiao Yan on the surface did not possess this qualification, Lin Xiuya and any observant person knew that this young man who was a little younger than them had a frightening fighting strength that was comparable to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHopefully, I will not meet an opponent that will give me too much of a headache tomorrow\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan muttered within his heart. He turned around and walked toward Xun Er and the others outside of the tall platform. Finally, he disappeared from everyone\u2019s sight amid the loud cheers within the stadium.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

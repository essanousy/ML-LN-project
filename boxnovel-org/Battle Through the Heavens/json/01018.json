At a glance, it was just like a large meandering snake that followed the mountain range to the top before disappearing in the distant dark clouds. One would feel exceptionally small while walking it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s footsteps proceeded at a steady pace as he slowly walked to the top of the mountain. Both sides of the mountain road were covered with large silver-colored tree. Such a tree was quite strange. This kind of tree did not have any leaves. Its entire being was just like a straight pillar. The thing that caused Xiao Yan to be surprised was that the interior of this enormous silver-colored tree contained a dense lightning energy. If one used one\u2019s Spiritual Strength to sense it, one would be able to discover a wave of lightning aura at the top of the enormous tree that repeatedly surged out. Finally, it rose into the dark clouds in the sky.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan halted his feet as he looked at this scene, falling deep into thought as he did so. The reason the Lightning Mountain possessed such a frightening Wind Lightning Strength was probably related to these unusual trees. With the silver trees providing a lightning strength, the dark clouds in the sky would never scatter. Thus, one would be able to achieve double the effect with half the effort when practicing a lightning affinity Qi Method in this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Wind Lightning Pavilion really knows how to choose a place\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan praised them in his heart. His feet had just moved when the clear cry of a crane suddenly resounded. Everyone immediately looked up to see a beautiful and colourful crane flapping its wings as it flew from the bottom of the mountain all the way to the peak.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven Colored Large Crane? Could it be that Miss Feng from the Wind Lightning Pavilion is the one on it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mountain road immediately emitted numerous exclamations and envious noises when they saw the Seven Colored Large Crane.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze also paused on that Seven Colored Large Crane. He did not take another look at the colorful crane. Instead, his gaze locked onto the graceful figure on the back of the enormous crane. Looking at that familiar back, this lady was indeed Feng Qing Er.</p><br/><p>The enormous crane did not pause because of the numerous exclamations from the mountain road. With a flap of its enormous wings, it charged into the clouds and quickly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly withdrew his eyes after the enormous crane disappeared. His brows were involuntarily knit together. There was definitely something on that lady hiding her aura. Otherwise, it would be impossible for Xiao Yan to not be able see through her strength with his current ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like this woman is not simple. I have seen the people from the four pavilions. If I really want to compare them, this Feng Qing Er is the most dangerous\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan revealed an expression of being deep in thought as he muttered to himself in his heart. Those that he did not know were the most frightening things. Tang Ying, Wang Chen, and Mu Qing Luan might be strong since they possessed their own trump cards that could fight with an expert Dou Zong. However, the three of them did not give Xiao Yan such a dangerous feeling. Only this Feng Qing Er\u2026 caused him to be unable to see through her.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I have guessed correctly, it is likely that the final victor in this Four Pavilion Grand Meeting will be this woman\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan softly sighed. Although there was no basis for this thinking of his, he vaguely had a feeling that caused him to think in this manner.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was due to the Wind Lightning Pavilion, but Xiao Yan did not have a good impression of Feng Qing Er. Although the other party had an outstanding appearance and demeanor, Xiao Yan had a grudge with her right from the start. Hence, his heart felt a little displeased if he were to see her obtain victory in the Grand Meeting.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan curled his mouth and muttered in his heart. After which, he ceased remaining still on this mountain road any longer. He increased his pace. In the end, he transformed into a black line that swiftly rushed to the top of the mountain.</p><br/><p>Although the Lightning Mountain was quite tall, Xiao Yan successfully reached the top of the mountain within less than ten minutes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had just ascended to the peak when a demon-like noise poured into his ears, causing him to feel a little giddy due to him not being to prepare. When he recovered, his eyes swept around with some lingering fear. He was immediately stunned. All he could see was an unending human sea.</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with Xiao Yan\u2019s character, he could not help, but feel somewhat speechless at this moment. He did not expect this Four Pavilion Grand Meeting to actually attract such a crazy flow of human traffic.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was stunned for a moment before he sighed in resignation. His body moved and he rushed to an enormous silver-colored tree. At this moment, quite a number of people were also standing in those strange silver trees around. Therefore, Xiao Yan did not attract many eyes.</p><br/><p>With the help of a good view, Xiao Yan was able to roughly see the peak of the Lightning Mountain. The place they were currently at was a stadium. This stadium\u2019s building material was clearly the enormous silver-colored tree that Xiao Yan was currently standing on. Its entirety was bright-silver in color and quite glaring. There were some potholes in the stadium. It seemed that this was the place where the disciples of the Wind Lightning Pavilion usually trained.</p><br/><p>The most eye-catching part of the entire peak of the Lightning Mountain was an enormous silver-colored tower. This tower was at least three to four hundred feet in height, appearing extremely majestic. A lightning glow flickered around the tower while the peak of it was inserted into the cloud layer, giving it an extremely mysterious feeling.</p><br/><p>There were many buildings on the top of the mountain, likely the quarters of the Wind Lightning Pavilion\u2019s disciples. Xiao Yan merely swept his gaze around this places before pausing it on the front of the enormous silver-colored stadium. There were some silver wooden chairs placed at a spot with an extremely good view. Quite a number of stern-looking Wind Lightning Pavilion disciples were standing in front of those seats. Looking at the aura that faintly seeped out of them, it was clear that they were not ordinary disciples.</p><br/><p>At this moment, these seats were all empty. Clearly, those who had the qualification to sit in them were the heavyweights in the four pavilions.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sat cross-legged in the silver tree when he saw that the Grand Meeting had not formally begun. After which, he shut his eyes and recuperated\u2026</p><br/><p>The time Xiao Yan recuperated did not last for long when a clear gong sound suddenly appeared on the Lightning Mountain. Immediately, numerous agile figures flashed from the mountain top. After which, they spread apart. The positions in which these scattered individuals occupied was excellent. They coincidentally surrounded the entire mountain top. Any unusual movement would be locked onto by the sharp eyes of these guards.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe disciples of the Wind Lightning Pavilion are indeed well-trained\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes opened when the gong sound appeared. He randomly glanced at the positions the human figures occupied as he quietly spoke in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>An enormous thunderbolt suddenly rushed down from the cloud layer while Xiao Yan was muttering to himself. The instantaneous bright light caused most people to reflexively shut their eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes, studying the enormous thunderbolt. A couple of people were slowly walking out of that spot. Finally, they sat on the silver wooden seats.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes swept over them and his gaze immediately paused on a familiar figure. A coldness flashed across his eyes. \u201cFei Tian\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s actually the Wind Lightning Pavilion\u2019s four pavilion chiefs. Tsk tsk, the Wind Lightning Pavilion is indeed filled with experts. The person in the middle should be the rumored Lei zun-zhe, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Some exclamations resounded over the place when everyone opened their eyes and saw the four people at the seats.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart jumped when he heard this. His gaze turned and instantly paused on a person at the middle. This person had a large build and looked as though he was only forty or fifty years old. However, his chin was covered in a silver-colored beard. He was wearing a silver-colored robe with lightning pictures sewn on it. Looking from a distance, those pictures seemed to be alive as they continuously flowed. A slight lightning aura even vaguely seeped out of it.</p><br/><p>This person\u2019s aura seemed to be far inferior to Fei Tian and the two others. He even had the feeling of an ordinary person. However, by relying on his exceptional Spiritual Perception, Xiao Yan clearly sensed a dangerous feeling from this person. Such a feeling was something that even Fei Tian did not give off.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs he the chief of the Wind Lightning Pavilion, the one called Lei zun-zhe? He is indeed extremely frightening\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan exhaled. This was the first time his actual body had faced a real Dou Zun for the first time. Although the purple-clothed, old man whom he had met at the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 was also a Dou Zun, Xiao Yan was merely a wisp of Spiritual Strength at that time.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwoosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>An ear-piercing wind sound suddenly resounded over Lightning Mountain when Xiao Yan was feeling amazed in his heart. Immediately, everyone was stunned to see an enormous sword that was over a hundred feet in size cutting through the distant space, rushing over. Within a flash, it appeared in the sky above the stadium.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Jian zun-zhe, you are the fastest to arrive this time around.\u201d A silver-robed Lei zun-zhe stood up when he saw the enormous sword in the sky. After which, his laughter sounded over the Lightning Mountain like rolling thunder.</p><br/><p>The enormous sword shook gently and transformed into countless light spots as it collapsed. Two figures slowly descended from the sky above, landing at their seats.</p><br/><p>The two figures consisted of an old and young man. Xiao Yan was familiar with the young person. He was Tang Ying from the Ten Thousand Sword Pavilion. The old man beside him was small in size. He was wearing linen clothes and seemed like an inconspicuous, small, old man. However, everyone present knew that this small, old man was a frightening existence who was on the same level as Lei zun-zhe.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is unexpected that even Jian zun-zhe has arrived. Looks like those who have arrived at the Wind Lightning Mountain Range earlier are merely the advance party of the four pavilions. Those who are arriving now are the core individuals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jian zun-zhe\u2019s appearance instantly caused the stadium\u2019s atmosphere to become fiery hot.</p><br/><p>Jian zun-zhe did not really bother with Lei zun-zhe\u2019s laughter. He rolled his eyes and sat down in a chair. Tang Ying behind him respectfully stood with his hands lowered.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, old Jian still has such temper. It looks like the match back then is still a blotch in your heart.\u201d A strange laugh, that carried a sinister feeling, sounded when Jian zun-zhe had just sat down. Immediately, a dark-black glow rushed over from the foot of the mountain. It appeared to have teleported as materialized in their seats. With a wave of his sleeves, the figure unceremoniously sat down.</p><br/><p>The human figure, who had appeared, was an old man in black robes. His facial complexion was pale and a somewhat shady look was present between his brows. One of his eyes was black while the other was white, giving him an extremely strange appearance. A familiar figure was behind him. This person was naturally Wang Chen from the Yellow Spring Pavilion.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, the old me was unlucky and narrowly lost to him. It is at least much better than some people who have merely lasted for a hundred exchanges in Feng zun-zhe\u2019s hands before being defeated by him. Don\u2019t you agree Huang Quan zun-zhe?\u201d Jian zun-zhe glanced at the black-robed, old man as he spoke in a neutral voice.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the black-robed, old man immediately turned chilly when he heard these words. Before he could retort, however, there was a slight change in his expression. His sinister eyes locked firmly on the sky. There was a dragon-roar-like wind suddenly transmitted over from that spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow clearly has the fastest speed, yet he always likes to be the last to arrive\u2026\u201d Jian zun-zhe raised his eyes. His turbid gaze looked at the distant sky as he laughed.</p><br/><p>Jian zun-zhe\u2019s voice had just sounded when the dragon roar like wind was transmitted over with a \u2018bang.\u2019 Immediately, an enormous green whirlwind appeared above the mountain in front of a countless number of eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly shifted when this green-colored whirlwind appeared. He stared firmly at it and the fists in his sleeves abruptly tightened.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeng zun-zhe\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

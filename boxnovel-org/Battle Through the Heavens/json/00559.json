Even Liu Qing, Lin Xiuya, and the others could not even guarantee a fifty-percent chance of victory even if they went all out to face Zi Yan. Yet this fellow\u2026</p><br/><p>The man on the stage also sensed that there was something wrong with the gazes around him after he spoke those words. However, he did not know the exact reason for it. The smile on his face stiffened a little as his gaze swept carefully over Zi Yan. How would he be able to see Zi Yan\u2019s baseline with just his strength? In his eyes, he could only sense that the latter\u2019s body did not have very strong Dou Qi flowing. She appeared weak and appeared to be too frail to even receive a blow...</p><br/><p>Zi Yan finally came to the arena under the numerous strange gazes from around. Her large dark-black eyes glanced at the man as her ten fingers crossed each other. With a gentle push, her bones immediately emitted a cracking sound. She raised her head and eyed First Elder Su Qian and spoke in a proud and old manner, \u201cHey, old fellow. Can we begin?\u201d</p><br/><p>The entire stadium was immediately dumbfounded when these words were emitted. Some of the people who knew Zi Yan\u2019s identity were a little better off. Those who were ignorant had faces that were completely dull. There was actually someone in the Inner Academy who dared to speak to the First Elder in such a manner? Moreover, Zi Yan\u2019s opponent was also among these dull people.</p><br/><p>Su Qian helplessly shook his head from the tall platform. He really did not have any solution with regards to this playful little fellow. His gaze glanced at some of those Elders who were snickering beside him and could only wave his hand as he said, \u201cBegin. Remember, do not take a person\u2019s life!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Yan cutely shrugged her shoulders and said, \u201cRelax. One punch. Whether it will result in a serious or minor injury all depends on how well he can resist blows.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cArrogant!\u201dAlthough the other party was only a little girl, the face of the man on the opposite side could not help but sink after being looked down upon in such a matter in front of so many people. He said in an extremely stern voice, \u201cDon\u2019t think that I will show mercy just because you are a little girl. Remember my name, Bei Ju!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Yan immediately swung her pale-purple ponytail as she eyed the man who had displayed a lecturing manner. Her cute clear fangs rubbed against one another. Immediately, her delicate feet were raised slightly and landed abruptly a moment later!</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>A deep muffled explosion suddenly sounded when her feet landed. In an instant, a half a foot wide crack line swiftly spread out from Zi Yan\u2019s feet in front of endless shocked gasps. The crack line was like a python that was ambushing the underground. In a short while, it reached the feet of the similarly stunned man who called himself Bei Ju. The crack line extended, and an invisible force shot out. Finally, it smashed heavily toward the two legs of the man.</p><br/><p>Bei Ju also appeared to have sensed something when the crack line had reached his feet. Although a dark shadow and uneasiness had appeared in his heart the instant that Zi Yan had displayed her frightening strength, he was unable to think much at that moment. With a stern cry, powerful Dou Qi immediately erupted violently from his body, forming a gray-white Dou Qi Armor on the surface of his body an instant later.</p><br/><p>Bei Ju\u2019s Dou Qi Armor agglomerated extremely swiftly. Clearly, he also possessed quite a great strength in order to be able to reach this step. However\u2026 if something must be blamed, he could only blame his poor luck in meeting Zi Yan, who even Liu Qing, Lin Xiuya, and the others avoided at any cost.</p><br/><p>With Zi Yan\u2019s strength which was comparable to a Dou Wang, even a mere single strike possessed a strength that could not be underestimated. Hence, even though Bei Ju\u2019s body had Dou Qi Armor protecting him, that tough looking Dou Qi Armor was basically completely smashed apart at a withering pace the moment the two came into contact. Moreover, his armor completely cracked apart in an extremely short time\u2026 that ferocious force mercilessly penetrated the Dou Qi Armor and collided at a spot between Bei Ju\u2019s legs. Therefore\u2026 a sharp scream that tore his lungs sounded in the stadium.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>As they watched Bei Ju, who was hugging his lower body while his entire body was curled up on the ground like a large prawn, everyone wiped off the cold sweat on their face while looking stunned. Some of the male students held their lower body unconsciously as a reflex. Their bodies became cold. If they were to be struck in this manner\u2026 it was likely that even if that thing was healed, one would form a phobia in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and the others on the high platform were similarly stunned as they eyed the arena. A moment later, they involuntarily swallowed a mouthful of saliva. This fellow\u2026 although she appeared to be harmless to both men and beasts and even looked quite cute\u2026 her attack was quite vicious.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat brute force\u2026 it seems that she did not even use any energy and completely relied on the strength of her physical body.\u201d Xun Er\u2019s watery pupils stared intently at Zi Yan as she softly spoke. Her voice contained a little surprise.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. The moment Zi Yan struck, he did not sense much of an energy fluctuation. However, he understood things much more clearly the moment he thought of her true identity. Most of the Magical Beasts were renowned for their powerful physical bodies. Moreover, even Yao Lao had said that Zi Yan might be a rare unique beast from ancient times. In that case, it was not surprising that she possessed such a powerful strength.</p><br/><p>The faces of Su Qian and the other Elders on the judges seats twitched a little. Some of the Elders let out a couple of dry laughs with none of them knowing what they ought to say\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*.\u201d Su Qian withdrew the emotions on his face and let out a dry cough. He said with a bitter smile, \u201cZi Yan is victorious in this match.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi, boring.\u201d Zi Yan curled her mouth. She waved her hand in a bored manner as her feet stomped on the ground. Her lovely little body shot explosively into the air before gently landing near the guardrail, that Xiao Yan was leaning on, on the tall platform. She smiled at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour attack is really vicious.\u201d As Xiao Yan eyed Zi Yan\u2019s cute manner that appeared to be carved out from jade, even he would not believe that Zi Yan would be able to use such a vicious tactic had he not witnessed it for himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other time, I had coincidentally seen him obtain victory in a match. After the match, he had openly told everyone that his next opponent was you.\u201d Zi Yan glanced at the next match which had begun in the arena, grabbed her pale-purple pony tail and laughed as she spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was a little stunned when he heard this. He had thought that Zi Yan had acted in this manner because she was impatient with the other party. It was unexpected that the matter actually contained some relation to him. However\u2026 this little girl was really amiable for him...</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and rubbed Zi Yan\u2019s small head. He spoke with soft laughter, \u201cI am able to settle these kinds of matters. You need not be bothered about them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t help you, you will definitely not help me refine Danwans in the future.\u201d Zi Yan unhappily shook her head and grunted. As a Magical Beast, she did not have as many cunning plots as a human. She kept innocently thinking that only by getting Xiao Yan to truly owe her a favor would he continue to help her refine Danwans.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou owe me a favor now that I have helped you teach that fellow a lesson. I will remember this.\u201d Zi Yan muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, alright. You can consider that I owe you a favor.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head, feeling neither able to laugh nor cry. He pulled Zi Yan\u2019s pony tail and eyed her cute face that had revealed a happy smile in the blink of an eye. The image of a little girl, with a timid face and her body always humbly lowered mixed with the blood of both human and snake flashed across his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how Qing Lin is doing\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan sighed in his heart. Back then that little girl who had fallen into the mouth of a tiger in the Jia Ma Empire had eventually been snatched away by the people from the \u2018Sky Serpent Mansion\u2019 from his hands. Xiao Yan kept feeling a certain guilt toward this timid little girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee.\u201d Zi Yan laughed when she saw Xiao Yan nodding his head. She revealed her cute little fangs. Her body stood on the guardrail and patted Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders while speaking in a heroic voice, \u201cYou can rest assured that with me covering for you, I will definitely let you enter the top ten. I will beat whoever dares to snatch your position until he is half alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Yan\u2019s voice was not lowered. Therefore, the competitors on the high platform could hear what she said. At that moment, most of the faces changed a little. Many people understood just how frightening Zi Yan was in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. He gently knocked Zi Yan\u2019s head. As he looked at her rubbing her forehead with a face that was filled with blame, he could not help but laugh and say, \u201cI will naturally go all out in order to get into the top ten. If you were to help me, I would not be able to sit steadily even if I managed to enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Yan rolled her eyes. She muttered a couple of sentences, but complied and did not continue to say those words from a moment ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, it is unexpected that brother Xiao Yan is actually this familiar with Senior Zi Yan.\u201d A familiar laughter suddenly sounded by his side. Xiao Yan turned his head to take a look. It was actually Lin Xiuya and the others. At this moment, the gazes of these people were all partially drifting toward Zi Yan by the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth widened. He weighed the two of them and was unable to restrain a smile. However, on top of feeling that it was funny, he was also a little stunned. Usually, Lin Xiuya maintained an indifferent aura in front of everyone. However, no matter how he looked at it, that smile contained worry and even fear\u2026</p><br/><p>Zi Yan glanced at Lin Xiuya and spoke lazily, \u201cSo it\u2019s you. It has been a long time since we\u2019ve last met. You really ran very quickly in the last match.\u201d</p><br/><p>Embarrassment surfaced on Lin Xiuya\u2019s face as he became speechless. Back then, in that \u2018Strong Ranking\u2019 Grand Competition, he had coincidentally met with Zi Yan in the final round. At that time, his strength was naturally not as strong as it was now. Therefore, the moment he met with Zi Yan, he ran away from the arena and admitted defeat in an extremely decisive manner. This caused Zi Yan, who had failed to beat up someone, to continue to feel resentment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis competition is really boring. You can all continue to play. Looks like there will not be a match for me today.\u201d Zi Yan eyed the extremely fiery fights in the arena that came and went only to let out a yawn. She waved her hand at Xiao Yan before she leaped down from the tall platform and sprang out of the stadium.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head as he eyed Zi Yan\u2019s disappeared body. He turned his head around and looked at Lin Xiuya\u2019s manner where he wanted to speak only to stop himself. Xiao Yan raised his brows, smiled, and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, is brother Xiao Yan very familiar with Senior Zi Yan?\u2019 Lin Xiuya laughed dryly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo-so,\u201d Xiao Yan spread his hand and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, in that case I would like to ask brother to tell her that it is fine for me to lose if I meet her during the competition as long as she does not embarrass me too much. Honestly speaking, if one were to say that I am a little afraid of Liu Qing, then I would be terrified of her. I think\u2026 Liu Qing may be also thinking in this manner.\u201d Lin Xiuya spoke awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was immediately dumb when he heard this. Who would have thought that this leader of the Inner Academy\u2019s \u2018Wolf Teeth\u2019 would actually be this afraid of Zi Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will help you tell her when we meet.\u201d Xiao Yan endured the laughter in his heart as he nodded.</p><br/><p>Lin Xiuya finally sighed in relief after hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s reply. The former gave the latter a smile of gratitude before cupping his hands together and leaving.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out soft laughter as he eyed Lin Xiuya who had turned around and left. It was indeed true that one thing surrenders to another...</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fourth match: number fifteen!\u201d</p><br/><p>A cry suddenly sounded from the judges\u2019 seats just as Xiao Yan sighed, causing him to be slightly startled. He immediately raised his head, only to see the faintly smiling gaze of Su Qian being shot toward him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it finally my turn\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan turned around and threw his gaze toward a pair of vicious gazes that had been thrown over. The corner of his mouth was lifted into a cold smile!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

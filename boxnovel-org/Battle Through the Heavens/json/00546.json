It was a long while later before Xiao Yan, who had understood the cause and effect, to slowly let out a breath of air. His voice was low as he asked, \u201cHow is big brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe were being chased all the way. With our strength, the Xiao clan\u2019s elimination would not be unexpected if it continued. However, it was fortunate that some reinforcements appeared at a critical point which saved our remaining Xiao clan.\u201d Happiness appeared on Xiao Li\u2019s pale-white face when he spoke until this point.</p><br/><p>\u201cReinforcements? There is still a faction in the Jia Ma Empire who dares to contend with the Misty Cloud Sect?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this as he spoke with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reinforcement appeared in the dark-black forest. At first, we also did not know about it. Those who came only revealed their identities after pushing back those that were giving chase. That person is also someone you know. It is that old man who had once followed beside you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHai Bodong? Old Hai?\u201d Xiao Yan was slightly stunned. The face of an old man who always had a cold and indifferent expression slowly surfaced in Xiao Yan\u2019s mind. Xiao Yan nodded as he came to a sudden understanding. He kept gratitude within his heart. This kindness of Hai Bo Dong who had took action to rescue the remnants of the Xiao clan was quite great. It was likely that Xiao Yan had to return it properly to the other party in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother may have also been seriously injured, but it was fortunate that he retained his life with the help of that old man. That person appears to have an extremely high position within the Primer clan. Therefore, the remnant members of the Xiao clan who had survived have been secretly moved under their protection to a place beyond the reach of the Misty Cloud Sect. The flying Magical Beast that I rode to the Jia Nan Academy was also borrowed from the Primer clan. Otherwise, with our current financial ability, I would only be able to walk to the Jia Nan Academy on my feet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, this \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 is indeed worthy of being the most chaotic place. Hee hee, I had been secretly backstabbed a couple of times during this period of time and had nearly left this little life of mine there. These injuries were also obtained from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. Those fellows are really as vicious as hungry wolves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan clenched his teeth tightly. He had personally experienced how chaotic and bloody the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 was and naturally clearly understood that Xiao Li could have been considered to have traveled tens of thousands of kilometers, climbed mountains, and waded through waters in order to come and inform him about the unexpected change in the Xiao clan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li smiled bitterly and said, \u201cCurrently, the Desert Metal Mercenary Company is completely finished. The Xiao clan is a little better off. However, it is in a battered shape. Its strength is no longer like it was in the past. We have to live in secret and struggle to survive while at death\u2019s door.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan held Xiao Li\u2019s hand. He said in a soft voice that has a repressed vengeance, \u201cSecond brother, I will definitely avenge this blood debt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe must naturally avenge it. This Misty Cloud Sect has forced our Xiao clan into this manner. How would we account to those Elders who had fought to their death to protect it if we don\u2019t kill that old dog Yun Shan?\u201d A malice surfaced on Xiao Li\u2019s face as he spoke with a thick smile, \u201cAs long as us three brothers are still alive, we will let the Misty Cloud Sect suffer great losses!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded quietly. His heart felt a little wider. At least, nothing had happened to his big brother and second brother. He really dared not think whether he would be able to retain his sense of reasoning like he did now if his big brother and second brother were to die in an attack by the Misty Cloud Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cOlder cousin Xiao Li, my... are my parents alright?\u201d Xiao Yu at the side suddenly spoke. Her voice carried a tremble.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, Xiao Yu, you are really becoming more and more beautiful after not seeing you for a couple of years\u2026\u201d The malice on Xiao Li\u2019s face disappeared as he eyed Xiao Yu, whose eyes had turned red. He mused for a moment and said in a somewhat ashamed manner, \u201cAunt Xiao is alright, but uncle lost an arm during the battle\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yu\u2019s eyes became even redder. However, it was fortunate that the worst situation that Xiao Yu had expected did not occur. Therefore, her extremely tense mind did not collapse because of this. She quietly stood to one side after nodding slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother, you should first recuperate from your injuries. The blood feud of our clan must be avenged, but you can rest assured that I will not be reckless. It was just that the blood had rushed to my head earlier.\u201d Xiao Yan once again took out a medicinal pill from his storage ring and handed it to Xiao Li as he spoke softly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li received the medicinal pill and stuffed it into his mouth without the slightest hesitation. His eyes stared directly at Xiao Yan and he said in a deep voice, \u201cOther people can be reckless, but you can not. Now, you are the only hope of the entire Xiao clan. The matter of Father\u2019s disappearance also requires your strength. Your big brother and I possess training talents that are inferior to you. We can die, but you can not! If any accident were to befall you, the Xiao clan would be completely finished!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly as he smiled and patted Xiao Li\u2019s hand. He spoke to Xiao Yu, \u201cCan you take care of second brother first? I need to speak with Xun Er.\u201d Once he said this, he lifted his chin toward Xun Er before the two of them slowly withdrew out of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me some information about the so called \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019. With your background, I think that you should have heard of them.\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s expression once again turned dark and solemn on the roof as he spoke indifferently to Xun Er.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Hall of Souls\u2019? How do you know about them?\u201d Xun Er\u2019s face immediately changed a little when she heard this name pop out of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have once met them by chance. The attacking method of those black shadows that second brother described is nearly completely the same as those few people from the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019. I think that they are definitely somehow involved in this matter.\u201d Xiao Yan waved his hand. His eyes stared at Xun Er as he spoke in a deep voice, \u201cTell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er hesitated a little while under Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze. She finally smiled bitterly and nodded. She arranged the information related about the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 within her mind before speaking slowly, \u201cThe \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 is an extremely mysterious and strange organization on the continent. The thing that they like to do most is to search for spiritual bodies all over the continent. After which, they capture them. Even I am not certain why they want so many spiritual bodies\u2026 this organization has traces that are all over the continent. It is just unexpected that they would infiltrate even a conservative country like the Jia Ma Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 has existed for quite a long time. Therefore, they are similarly aware of many secrets on the continent. I think that the reason for them to look for the Xiao clan should be related to the \u2018Tou She Ancient God\u2019s Jade\u2019 in Xiao Yan ge-ge\u2019s hands.\u201d Xun Er sighed softly. She quickly continued, \u201cThe piece of \u2018Tou She Ancient God\u2019s Jade\u2019 in Xiao Yan ge-ge\u2019s hand is actually merely a portion of a \u2018key\u2019. There are other portions that were left in other places of the continent. My clan has a portion. Additionally\u2026 this \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 also possesses a portion.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese \u2018keys\u2019 contain an extremely great secret. I am also not the slightest bit aware of what exactly this secret entails. The only thing I can tell Xiao Yan ge-ge is that no matter whether it is my clan or the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019, they value these \u2018keys\u2019 to the extreme. Back then, in order to fight for these \u2018keys\u2019, my clan fought with the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019. Although we were finally victorious, we did not get what we wished.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 has attacked the Xiao clan, it is likely that they had obtained some news about that portion of the \u2018key\u2019 from some unknown source. Otherwise, the strength of the Xiao clan would have been insufficient to attract them to take action. What is a little unexpected is how the Misty Cloud Sect has become associated with the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019.\u201d Xun Er said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, from what second brother has said, that old man called Hai Bo Dong was able to force back those people chasing the Xiao clan. From this, it seems that the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 did not really send their true experts. Of course, my clan is constantly observing their actions. Therefore, their true experts could not have gone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKey, key, it is that damn key again!\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s hand violently smashed on the wall in front of him as he spoke furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, remember the words that I spoke to you the last time. You must not tell anyone about the matter of the \u2018Tou She Ancient God\u2019s Jade\u2019 being in your hand. Do not even tell older cousin Xiao Li. Otherwise, should he accidentally leak the information, the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 would come after you just in a never ending manner like the maggots in the tarsal bones.\u201d Xun Er took a step forward. Her soft body was pasted on Xiao Yan\u2019s body as she lowered her voice and spoke to him in a serious manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan clenched his teeth tightly and eyed the elegant face that was just next to him. He sniffed the faint fragrance that drifted into his nostrils as his hands embraced abruptly, violently pulling Xun Er into a hug. He had been unable to hide the remorse he felt in his heart in front of the person closest to him. His voice was hoarse as he said, \u201cIf I had not acted in a young and arrogant manner back then and created the whatever Three Year Agreement with Nalan Yanran, I\u2019m afraid that things would not become like what they are today. I would also have not implicated the clan until it became ruined, and my relatives would not have to be separated!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf a person did not act frivolously, their youth would have been in vain. Xiao Yan ge-ge, you are not wrong.\u201d Xun Er\u2019s soft and gentle cheek leaned on Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders as she replied gently, \u201cWealth would bring greed and bring harm. Even if Xiao Yan ge-ge did not come into conflict with the Misty Cloud Sect, that \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 would have sooner or later arrived at the door of the Xiao clan. Moreover, with their vicious means, they would definitely have wiped out everyone. At that time, the Xiao clan would have either suffered serious losses or have been completely destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only thing that you can do now is to get yourself to become stronger. It is just as second brother said. Both the vengeance of the clan, and the matter of the disappearance of uncle Xiao Zhan must rely on you. You are currently the support pillar of the Xiao clan. If you were to fall, the entire clan would no longer have the chance to stand up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, Xiao Yan ge-ge, you must remember that the Xiao clan has yet to fall at this moment. Big brother is currently in the Jia Ma Empire leading the remaining members of the Xiao clan. They still require you to return.\u201d</p><br/><p>The gentle voice that came out like a strength-draining drug that caused Xiao Yan\u2019s heart, which had been filled with vengeance and killing intent, to gradually recover its previous clarity and brightness. It was a long while later before Xiao Yan eventually raised his head and inhaled a mouthful of icy-cool air. He relaxed his arm that was embracing Xun Er\u2019s waist. That delicate and handsome face lacked the lazy smile that was usually carelessly hanging on it. Instead, there was an additional faint cold sternness. At this moment, Xiao Yan could have been considered to have completely extracted himself from the tenderness of youth under the blow of the changes in the Xiao clan.</p><br/><p>A person would only truly change and grow up after experiencing a setback.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, I will no longer be reckless in the future. I will return once I have sufficient strength. At that time, I will get the Misty Cloud Sect to repay all its debt by a hundred times!\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s hand touched Xun Er lovely and tender face. His voice was, however, dense, cold, and dark.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

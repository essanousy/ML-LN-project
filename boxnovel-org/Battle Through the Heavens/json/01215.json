The atmosphere within the hall was quite solemn.</p><br/><p>Ever since Xiao Yan had walked into the large hall, he had been staring intently at Xuan Kong Zi trio. Even his breathing had become a little hurried because of his excitement. It had been around five or six years since Yao Lao had been captured back then until now. Although Yao Lao\u2019s life had not been at risk during these five or six years, the suffering he had endured was definitely unbelievable.</p><br/><p>All of Xiao Yan\u2019s abilities had come about because Yao Lao paved the way for him. It was due to Yao Lao that Xiao Yan had been able to reach such a height. Hence, as long as it was something related to Yao Lao, Xiao Yan\u2019s emotions would fluctuate a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fellow, do not allow your mind to become chaotic. Rescuing Yao Lao is not a simple matter. If anything wrong occurs midway, it would be equivalent to delivering a goat to the mouth of a tiger.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xuan Kong Zi involuntarily shook his head and spoke when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently nodded upon hearing Xuan Kong Zi\u2019s scolding words. Xiao Yan took a couple of deep breaths and suppressed his fluctuating mind. His eyes once again recovered their calmness. He softly asked, \u201cWhy was the information regarding this collected so quickly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt cannot be considered quick. If one wanted to really talk about it, we have collected this information for nearly a year in order to obtain this news. However, we have only managed to confirm it now.\u201d Xuan Kong Zi smiled as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere has the Hall of Souls transferred teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes did not blink as he stared at Xuan Kong Zi and swiftly asked.</p><br/><p>Xuan Kong Zi smiled. He took out a map scroll from his Storage Ring before spreading it apart on the table. His finger pointed to the north-western part of the Central Plains and said, \u201cThere are quite a number of secretive branch Halls within the Central Plains of the Hall of Souls. An ordinary person would not be able to discover them. There is a Death Soul Mountain Range in the north-western region. That place hides a branch hall of the Hall of Souls.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHas teacher been transferred to this Death Soul Mountain Range\u2019s branch hall?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes flickered as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xuan Kong Zi slightly nodded and said, \u201cThis Death Soul Mountain Range can be considered a dangerous place within the Central Plains. For some unknown reason, the Cold Qi in that place is extremely dense. Cold fog covers the sun. If one were to randomly barge in, one would end up lost within it. Moreover, there are quite a number of powerful and unusually bloodthirsty Magical Beasts within the mountain range. It is extremely troublesome to deal with them. Probably the reason why the Hall of Souls established a branch hall is because the concealment of this place had caught its eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath Soul Mountain Range\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan softly muttered this name in his mouth. Since he was aware of the location where Yao Lao was being imprisoned, he would definitely make an attempt without hesitation even if he had to enter an extremely treacherous place.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow many experts are there in that Hall of Souls branch hall? How many Dou Zuns are there?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor by the side softly posed the most important question. Xiao Yan would become a little excited when he met with anything related to Yao Lao. At this moment, she could only pay more attention to the situation.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also become clear-headed after hearing the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s question. He hurriedly nodded. This was the most important question. If they were unable to clearly probe the other party\u2019s defensive strength, randomly barging in would only deliver themselves to be captured.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hall of Souls really values Yao Chen. The defensive strength watching him is definitely not too weak. Based on the information we have obtained, there is likely five elite Dou Zuns guarding the Death Soul Mountain Range\u2026\u201d Even Xuan Kong Zi\u2019s expression had become a little more serious when he spoke until this point. Five Dou Zuns. This lineup was extremely powerful even when placed within the Central Plains. It belonged to the level where all they needed to do was stomp their feet and many top tier factions would be frightened to the point of peeing their pants.</p><br/><p>\u201cFive Dou Zuns\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed slightly upon hearing this. His mouth involuntarily inhaled a gentle breath of cool air. This strength\u2026 was really a little too great. The Hall of Souls had dispatched five Dou Zuns just to guard a branch hall. This lineup was sufficient to wash a top tier faction in blood.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor and Tian Huo zun-zhe also had faces that were a lot more grave. Clearly, they were shaken by the strength of this Hall of Souls.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan calculated that there were, at the very most, three Dou Zuns beside him if he included the Sky Demon Puppet. Currently, he was also able to hold back an elite Dou Zun. However, if he were to face two of them, it was likely that he could only turn around and flee.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, we can only wait for Feng zun-zhe to come. If we add him, we should close to enough enormous people to give it a try\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan mused in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre these all the Dou Zuns in that branch hall?\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor fell silent for a moment before asking again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on the information we got our hands on, there should only be five Dou Zuns. However, the branch hall definitely still has some Hall of Souls protectors. Their combined fighting strength would also be quite strong\u2026\u201d Xuan Kong Zi said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose protectors cannot be considered much trouble. However, all of you need to beware of meeting a Tianzun\u2026\u201d Xuan Yi by the side spoke with a grave face.</p><br/><p>\u201cTianzun?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s group was startled when they heard this foreign name.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Hall of Souls protectors are divided into the Sky, Earth, and Man category. Although the Honorable Elders do not have such a strict division, they are similarly divided according to rank. Tianzun are the strongest experts among the Honorable Elder ranking\u2026 as for their strength, the only thing you need to know is that even Old Mu Gu is not qualified to be a Tianzun in the Hall of Souls.\u201d Xuan Yi explained in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. Old Mu Gu\u2019s strength should be around that of a three star Dou Zun. Even he did not possess the qualification to be a Tianzun. Would it not be the case that these Tianzuns of the Hall of Souls were all at least five star Dou Zuns?</p><br/><p>Even with Xiao Yan\u2019s calmness, his brows were involuntarily knit when he thought of this. There was vast difference between every level within the Dou Zun class. Many Dou Zuns had spent dozens of years without being able to raise their strength by one star. From this, one could tell just what kind of terrifying gap was present between every star within the Dou Zun class.</p><br/><p>Five star Dou Zuns. It was likely that even the combined strength of Little Fairy Doctor and the Sky Demon Puppet would be able to fight them, but then the originally few Dou Zuns on Xiao Yan\u2019s side would be even more limited.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Hall of Souls is indeed terrifying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan exhaled a deep breath of air. Even though he really did not wish to admit it, he still involuntarily emitted a sigh at this moment. Even across the entire continent, it was likely hardly anyone could fight against such a terrifying strength with the exception of those factions that had originated since ancient times like the Gu clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to worry. Tianzuns have extremely high positions within the Hall of Souls. They will usually not easily reveal themselves. Five Dou Zuns guarding Yao Chen. This is already an extremely high standard. If another Tianzun is added, it would cause one to feel incredulous\u2026\u201d Xuan Kong Zi waved his hand and spoke when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s solemn expression.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. At this moment, he could only think in this manner. Since the status of these fellows were so high, it was unlikely for them to stay in a branch hall for no reason. After all, an expert should have the eccentricness of an expert.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the information that we have obtained. The Pill Region is not far from the Death Soul Mountain Range. It should be enough to reach there in five days or so.\u201d Xuan Kong Zi slowly spoke. After which, he took out a goat skin scroll and handed it to Xiao Yan, \u201cThis is the map of the interior of the Death Soul Mountain Range. The branch hall of the Hall of Souls is located in the middle of the mountain range.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan received the map and opened it. After which, he carefully studied the map. The map was extremely detailed. Although the cold fog within the mountain range was extremely dense, relying on such a precise map to successfully enter the range would not be too difficult.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much Old Xuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stored the map in his Storage Ring, cupped his hands together, and thanked Xuan Kong Zi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is merely a trivial matter. Ugh, however, this is all we can help you with. All of you will have to rely on yourselves for the final action\u2026\u201d Xuan Kong Zi waved his hand and sighed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and said, \u201cIf the Pill Tower had not helped us gather information, we do not know just when it would have been until we had found the location where teacher is imprisoned. Therefore, this is not a trivial matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xuan Kong Zi bitterly smiled and nodded. He asked, \u201cWhen are all of you preparing to act?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan mused for a moment before replying, \u201cThis operation must be well-prepared. Therefore, we must wait until Feng zun-zhe hurries over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Ha ha, that old fellow huh\u2026\u201d Xuan Kong Zi involuntarily laughed when he heard Feng zun-zhe being mentioned. He said, \u201cThat old fellow has an extremely good relationship with Yao Chen. Finding him will indeed be of great help. Moreover, he is extremely experienced. With him following all of you, we will definitely feel more reassured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. Feng zun-zhe could be considered a renowned expert across the Central Plains region. He had frequently come into contact with the Hall of Souls during the years he had searched for traces of Yao Lao. With him joining this operation, they would be able to understand a little more about the Hall of Souls. He would also boost their confidence in finally rescuing Yao Lao.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though this is the case, let\u2019s wait for news from the old fellow. With his speed, it should be possible for him to reach the Pill Region in half a month\u2019s time\u2026\u201d Xuan Kong Zi fondled his beard and laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly smiled slightly. Half a month? During this half a month, he needed to try his best to raise the strength of their group. It was time to refine the Fungus Green Pill for Tian Huo zun-zhe. If the strength of the people on his side was a little stronger, the chances of them succeeding would also increase.</p><br/><p>However, no matter how much more his conviction grew, this trip would be the most dangerous and important operation that Xiao Yan has ever undertaken. Therefore, he needed to do his best. He must not allow even the slightest reason to cause any mistake to occur during this operation.</p><br/><p>After chatting a little with Xuan Kong Zi and the others about areas they should take note of relating to the Hall of Souls and the Death Soul Mountain Range, Xiao Yan ceased remaining any longer. He directed the Little Fairy Doctor and the rest as they cupped their hands together and bade the others goodbye. After which, they hurriedly left. They were currently pressed for time, and they could not afford to squander it.</p><br/><p>Xuan Kong Zi and the two others exchanged looks with each other after watching Xiao Yan\u2019s group\u2019s backs leave through the door. They also softly sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHopefully this trip of theirs will be smooth. It has been many years since anyone has witnessed someone snatch a person from the hands of the Hall of Souls. I wonder if they will succeed this time around?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His eyes swept around before suddenly shooting to the tree branch of a large tree, only to see a purple-clothed, little girl there. Both of her legs were gently swinging.</p><br/><p>Even with Old Mu Gu\u2019s calmness, he was involuntarily startled when he saw this little girl. His eyes were covered with shock. Those who could enter the Pill Realm were all alchemists that participated in the Pill Gathering. However, this little girl in front was clearly not one of them. Just how did she enter this place?</p><br/><p>The purple-clothed, little girl ignored the surprised gaze of Old Mu Gu. Her small hand pressed against the tree branch and her lovely, small body leaped down from high above. After which, it gently landed in front of Xiao Yan. She involuntarily laughed when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s stunned expression before giving him a strange face. Her lovely and pretty actions were really likeable.</p><br/><p>\u201cZi Yan\u2026 why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shock within Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes lasted for a good amount of time before gradually disappearing. He grabbed this little girl, who had disappeared for quite a while, and pulled her to his side. After which, he carefully looked at her. Her jade-carving appearance was as cute as it was before, giving her an appearance similar to a porcelain doll.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have escaped. Hee hee, I knew that you were participating in the Pill Gathering, so I came here to wait for you\u2026\u201d Zi Yan smiled like a little fox. Both of her eyes narrowed into a crescent shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have been very pitiful. After having left, I no longer had any tasty Yaowan. Everyday, those hateful fellows would pour some disgusting stuff for me to eat\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Yan grabbed Xiao Yan\u2019s clothes. Her large watery eyes immediately became moist. Her life during this period of time was really too awful from her point of view. It was just like a life in hell when compared to the times she was beside Xiao Yan. Therefore, she had hurriedly took the opportunity to flee once she had the chance to do so\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYour tribe members?\u201d Xiao Yan was astonished before he immediately understood something. After which, he asked in a surprised manner.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan violently nodded. From the looks of it she greatly hated the way her tribe members treated her. However, if those members of her tribe came to be aware of this, they would likely be so furious that they would end up spitting out blood. In this world, one was not rewarded for being a good person.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. He did understand Zi Yan\u2019s character. Every word was exaggerated many times over when spoken from her mouth. Hence, he did not really believe these words of hers. As for whatever thing that was being fed to her\u2026 at the very least, this girl appeared quite lively. She was undoubtedly many times better than when she had left back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, have you finished chatting. Little grandaunt, this fellow is not someone easy to deal with\u2026\u201d That strongly built man turned his head somewhat impatiently and spoke to the two while Xiao Yan and Zi Yan were chatting.</p><br/><p>TL: grandaunt in this case refers to a woman that was difficult to serve</p><br/><p>\u201cBig fellow, there is no need for you to be anxious. Go and beat him. Your task will be considered nearly over once you finish him off.\u201d Zi Yan curled her small mouth before pointing at the gloomy-faced Old Mu Gu a short distance away. She instructed in a crisp voice.</p><br/><p>That large man and Old Mu Gu\u2019s faces involuntarily twitched when they heard her words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really think quite highly of me. It is already not bad that I can block him. If not for my constitution, I would not be able to beat him.\u201d The large man helplessly replied. He appeared quite speechless when it came to the task Zi Yan had assigned him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I know who this friend is?\u201d Xiao Yan looked at him. He smiled, cupped his hands together, and inquired politely.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is called Xiong Zhan. I call him big fellow. He is the chief of this Ten Thousand Medicinal Mountain Range. Hee hee, all of the natural treasures in this place are managed by him\u2026\u201d Zi Yan laughed. A greediness flashed across her watery eyes.</p><br/><p>That large man called Xiong Zhan involuntarily shuddered when he heard Zi Yan\u2019s words. He thought of the precious medicinal ingredients being eaten by Zi Yan as tidbits. This little fellow was really someone who wasted treasures.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart was slightly startled. If one put it this way, would this Xiong Zhan not be that ultimate beast talked about by Song Qing\u2019s group?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis friend, it is really not my intention to barge into this mountain. The old me shall apologize to you if I have offended you in any way. However, this person is a target that I must capture. I hope that you will not interfere!\u201d Old Mu Gu a short distance away finally spoke with a gloomy face. Although Xiong Zhan\u2019s level was inferior to him, his fighting strength was extremely shocking. It was impossible to tell just who would end up dying to whose hands.</p><br/><p>Xiong Zhan rolled his eyes upon hearing this. After which, he responded in an irritated manner, \u201cYou have heard what this little grandaunt said earlier. I must protect this person. Why don\u2019t we do it this way? I will not bother about you barging into the mountain, and you should just turn around and leave. What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Old Mu Gu\u2019s mouth twitched. His eyes gradually became cold. This time around, he had the intention of capturing Xiao Yan at any costs. The hinderance of anyone would not be able to shake his determination!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case\u2026\u201d Old Mu Gu became silent for a moment. A fierce glint suddenly surged within his eyes as he yelled in a dense voice, \u201cYou can go and die!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dense voice had just sounded when Old Mu Gu waved his sleeves. That crystal hand, which had been forced back by Xiong Zhan earlier, once again rushed out. Within a flash, the hand appeared in front of Xiong Zhan. The large hand was tightly clenched, forming a fist that violently smashed at the Xiong Zhan\u2019s head!</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The wind from the fist had arrived before the punch did. That terrifying fist wind caused the ground under Xiong Zhan\u2019s feet to sink by nearly two feet despite them being a great distance apart. An enormous fist imprint appeared on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee, the old me has dominated for so many years. I have not met anyone who dares tell me to go and die. Who do you think you are?\u201d</p><br/><p>A fierceness flashed across Xiong Zhan\u2019s face when he saw Old Mu Gu attacking at the first sign of a disagreement. His fist was clenched tightly and a deep-yellow energy surged out of his body. A fist was violently thrown out, and it chose the most direct, non-fanciful method to collide with the large crystal fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two violently collided and a terrifying ripple rushed out with lightning-like speed. All the grass within a hundred meter radius were cut by half a foot. Some of the gigantic trees\u2019 trunks were cut. A large amount of sawdust erupted from the spot where they broke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes and hands were swift. When that forceful ripple erupted, he had hugged Zi Yan, and moved his body. After which, he rushed to the sky, lowered his head, and looked at a patch of yellow soil that had appeared within the vast sea of trees. He was involuntarily a little speechless. It was indeed worthy of a battle between the Dou Zun class. Such a great destructive strength had been created by just a raise of one\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Xiong Zhan ended up taking two steps back within the forest now permeated by dust. The ground shook each time his feet landed. This continued two times before he managed to completely stabilize his body. He immediately raised his head, and his eyes were unusually hot as he looked at Old Mu Gu across from him. He cried out, \u201cAlright, it is enjoyable! Again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Mu Gu\u2019s expression turned dark and cold. He glanced at the large crystal claw that was once again sent flying. One could see the cracks on it had become denser.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe fighting strength of this Xiong Zhan is really great. In what way is he just an expert that has half a foot into the Dou Zun class as Song Qing had mentioned? From the looks of it, he has likely already advanced to the Dou Zun class. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for him to face Old Mu Gu head on without too much of a disadvantage.\u201d Xiao Yan softly spoke. Surprise involuntarily flashed across his eyes when he looked at the battle below.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe big fellow has already advanced to the Dou Zun class a couple of years ago.\u201d Zi Yan, who was in Xiao Yan\u2019s embrace, curled her mouth and revealed some information.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is fortunate that I did not listen to Song Qing while he was fanning the flames. Having only half a foot into the Dou Zun class and completely entering the Dou Zun class were two completely different concepts. With the lineup of Song Qing earlier, they would only deliver themselves to death by going there.\u201d Xiao Yan involuntarily smacked his tongue when he heard this. This Song Qing was indeed untrustworthy.</p><br/><p>On the yellow soil that was being forcefully created, Old Mu Gu\u2019s eyes were dark and dense as he stared at Xiong Zhan, who had a face filled with the intent to battle. Some killing intent also flashed across his heart. The level of difficulty in dealing with Xiong Zhan had far exceeded his expectations. However, this was impossible to get him to give up. Immediately, his shriveled hands rolled out of his sleeves and began to form seals with lightning-like speed!</p><br/><p>\u201cNether Demon Fire Arm!\u201d</p><br/><p>A deep-blue flame swiftly erupted from Old Mu Gu\u2019s body like a volcano following the cold cry emitted. It immediately surged into the large crystal claw.</p><br/><p>With an increasing amount of deep-blue flames surging into the large crystal claw, one could see the lines on the surface of the large claw gradually mend. A deep-blue arm of fire was slowly extended from the back of the large claw. The flame rose, causing this arm to give others a kind of extremely cold feeling. It appeared just like the arm of a death god.</p><br/><p>A grave expression flashed across Xiong Zhan\u2019s face when he saw the large arm with deep blue coloured fire lingering over it. A low roar was emitted from his throat. The large hand trembled slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose who hinder this venerable self shall die!\u201d</p><br/><p>A dark chilly expression flashed across Old Mu Gu\u2019s eyes. His hand seal suddenly changed and that large flame arm immediately rushed up. After which, it appeared just like a meteorite as it ruthlessly smashed down on the spot where Xiao Zhan was located. The space along the way suddenly crumbled, revealing many dark-black spatial holes.</p><br/><p>The large fire hand rushed down. When it was a certain distance away, the flame on it suddenly soared. The large fire hand also swelled with the wind. In an instant, it had transformed into something nearly a hundred feet around. An enormous dark shadow covered the forest within a hundred meter radius!</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiong Zhan let out a ferocious roar to the sky after sensing the hot energy pressure that was being transmitted from it. His body also began to swell with a \u2018swoosh swoosh\u2019 sound at this instant. Dark-black, long hair surged out of his body in all directions. Finally, he tightly clenched his enormous fist. A glaring, deep-yellow energy surged out like floodwater. At this instant, Xiao Zhan appeared to have merged with this enormous mountain, using the strength of the mountain to unleash a shocking strike!</p><br/><p>The large fire hand rushed down. An instant later, it collided with Xiong Zhan\u2019s enormous fist!</p><br/><p>The mountain shook and all the beasts trembled as a result.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Some dense whiteness occasionally broke the surface of the ground. They were broken bones that revealed a strange chill\u2026</p><br/><p>In the middle of this large area stood a quiet black hall. It seemed like an ancient ferocious beast as it crept across the ground. An extremely dark and terrifying feeling slowly fluctuated over this sealed space.</p><br/><p>There were countless, extremely large, and rough black chains extending from the large black hall. These chains were inserted deep into the ground. There was a cluster of black fog lingering over these chains. The fog vaguely formed a human shape. Some lusters occasionally flickered over the chains. Finally, they rushed into the black fog and caused the black fog to appear as though it possessed a form\u2026</p><br/><p>This entire area appeared unusually quiet. A strange atmosphere covered it, giving one goosebumps.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrash!\"</p><br/><p>Such silence continued for an unknown period of time before ten clusters of black fog stood up from the chains. The black fog shrank before turning into ten cold-looking human figures. These people exchanged looks with one another before they moved and gathered together.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. It is time for us to execute our mission. Hopefully, we will be able to bring back enough souls this time around\u2026\u201d A human figure, who appeared to be the leader of this group, spoke in a hoarse voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, old demon Liu\u2019s group launched a sneak attack against a couple of cities belonging to the Sky Mansion earlier. Not only did they manage to bring back a enough souls, they were even heavily rewarded by the First Tianzun. This time around, we will also turn a couple of Sky Mansion cities into a bloodbath\u2026\u201d One of people laughed in a sinister manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye, remember not to leave any survivors.\u201d That leader smiled. He slowly nodded and waved his hand. A dozen plus figures turned into black fog that hurried away from the hall with lightning-like speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>This group of black fog was about to charge out of the spatial barrier when the space around them suddenly stilled. It then violently collapsed. The dozen plus figures did not even manage to emit a miserable cry before they were crushed by the frightening spatial strength into nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cTear!\u201d</p><br/><p>The spatial barrier was slowly split apart as a big hole formed after this group of people were annihilated. A couple of figures slowly walked in from outside and stepped across the black soil.</p><br/><p>\u201cToot!\u201d</p><br/><p>A sharp sound was emitted from the large hall the moment Xiao Yan\u2019s group stepped through the barrier. The black fog above those chains revealed many pairs of sinister eyes that observed Xiao Yan\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you barge into the territory of my Hall of Souls. You are asking to die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sinister stern cries suddenly broke the silence. Many human figures stood up from the chains. Without waiting for any instructions, they turned into black lights that were accompanied by a dark wind as they charged toward Xiao Yan\u2019s group from all directions.</p><br/><p>\u201cA bunch of cannon fodder seems to happily be running around!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled after seeing them charge forward. He widened his mouth before a heated sea of fire shot out of his mouth. All of the black figures that entered within a hundred feet of the sea of fire would vanish after three breaths. Those weaker individuals did not even manage to let out a miserable scream.</p><br/><p>The sea of fire spread. Those black figures hurrying over from behind finally froze their bodies in shock. Only then did they understand that this group was not here to kill themselves. Instead, it had truly come prepared!</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, how dare you act wildly in the territory of my Hall of Souls! You must be tired of living! All Tianzuns, capture them!\u201d A somewhat familiar cry was suddenly emitted from the hall as the sea of fire spread across the sky. Immediately, a dozen plus figures rushed out of the hall with lightning-like speed. Finally, they floated on the horizon. Their eyes were dark as they looked at Xiao Yan\u2019s group behind the sea of fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, you actually dare to bring out some mere Dou Zuns? Old ghost Gu You, it is better for you to personally step forward!\u201d Xiao Yan loudly laughed. His laughter was like thunder as it rumbled and spread through the hall. He took a step forward as he laughed and stepped across the thousand-foot-wide sea of fire. He appeared in the air while his hand aimed at a group of Hall of Souls Tianzuns before abruptly clenching it. The space stilled as his hand was clenched again.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Xiao Yan clenched his hand, the bodies of the dozen plus Tianzuns blasted into pools of blood. Even their souls had been shattered by that terrifying spatial pressure.</p><br/><p>With Xiao Yan\u2019s current two star Dou Sheng strength, it was impossible for some Dou Zun experts to obstruct him by even a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Sea Heart Flame?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan suddenly let out an exclamation after he clenched his hand. There was a figure remaining in that collapsed space. Moreover, this person contained an azure-blue flame. Xiao Yan took a glance and recognized the origin of this flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are old man Mu Gu?\u201d A teasing smile was lifted on Xiao Yan\u2019s face. He waved his hand and an invisible force grabbed pulled that human figure over. He threw a palm and shattered the blue flame lingering on that figure. A familiar figure appeared from within. Surprisingly, that figure belonged to old man Mu Gu, who had repeatedly found trouble with Xiao Yan back then and had nearly snatched the Pill Gathering champion spot.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart was surprised. Old man Mu Gu, on the other hand, was shocked to the point where it he felt the impulse to wet himself. Ever since he had failed to snatch the Three Thousand Burning Flame, he had been dispatched to the Man Hall. He had been collecting souls from outside of the Central Plains during this period of time. Although he had occasionally heard about Xiao Yan\u2019s soaring strength during this period of time, he did not probe for more information. After meeting Xiao Yan again, he finally understood that so-called soaring strength was much more frightening\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDou Sheng\u2026 you have actually advanced to the Dou Sheng class?\u201d Old man Mu Gu looked at the young face and felt his voice tremble. Within a short few years, that member of the younger generation, who could only flee when he had been chased by him, had actually become this strong!</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, it has been many years since I have met you and I have been feeling some regret. The Sea Heart Flame is also a Heavenly Flame. It is really a waste of a natural resource to leave it with you. Since I have met you again, please hand it over!\u201d Xiao Yan laughed without being polite. His hand on old man Mu Gu\u2019s head. A strange suction force erupted from his hand. He actually intended to forcefully pull the Sea Heart Flame out of old man Gu Cha\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, you dare to barge into my Hall of Souls? You are really charging into hell to seek death!\u201d</p><br/><p>A furious roar was emitted from the hall while Xiao Yan was planning to forcefully extract the Sea Heart Flame. A black figure rushed forward. A thousand-foot-large dark-black chain penetrated air like a black poisonous dragon as it hurried to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cA mere Ban Sheng dares to embarrass himself? Old ghost Gu You, you really think too highly of yourself.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head slightly as that chain came. He flicked his finger and a low sonic boom formed from it. That enormous chain seemed to have suffered a heavy blow as it suddenly pulled back. Finally, it collided with the large hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan flicked aside Saint Gu You\u2019s attack with a finger. He grabbed with his hand and a cluster of blue flame was forcefully extracted from old man Mu Gu\u2019s body. His aura had also become a little weaker at this moment. Clearly, he had received a fatal blow.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, I shall engage in an all out fight with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old man Cha Gu\u2019s eyes turned blood-red after the Sea Heart Flame was forcefully removed. His body began to swell. He clearly intended to self-destruct.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe current you does not even possess the qualifications to self-destruct in front of me.\u201d Xiao Yan glanced at him with a cold and indifferent expression. He randomly waved his hand. A wave of indescribably frightening wind violently smashed into old man Mu Gu before shattering his body into a bloody fog the next moment. This Hall of Souls zun-zhe, who had turned Xiao Yan into a miserable state back then, was not even given the chance to self-destruct at this moment\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan glanced at the Sea Heart Flame in his hand after shattering old man Cha Gu\u2019s body. He opened his mouth and swallowed the Flame. With his current strength, swallowing the Sea Heart Flame would no longer result in an increase in strength, but it was necessary to unleash the Angry Buddha Lotus Flame. Although the \u2018Life Transforming Flame\u2019 was powerful, it was still a fake Heavenly Flame. Only after possessing this Sea Heart Flame would Xiao Yan be able to truly unleash a five-colored Extermination Fire Lotus\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, this place will definitely be where you die today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Saint Gu You flashed and appeared in the air after Xiao Yan swallowed the Sea Heart Flame. He cried out in a dark and dense voice at the same time.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I plan to turn this place into a bloodbath today\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan lifted his head and smiled at Saint Gu You. Zi Yan had already disrupted any spatial fluctuations that occurred in this place. Even if these people possessed a spatial jade to summon the experts from the Hun clan, they would not be able to use them.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of a young fellow like you?\u201d Saint Gu You ended up laughing in extreme anger after hearing those words. Xiao Yan was the first person in many years who dared to mention turning the Hall of Souls into a bloodbath.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, I am aware that you are not the one in charge here\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan ignored Saint Gu You. His eyes shifted to the large black hall as he said in a faint voice, \u201cThat so-called First Tianzun, there is no need to continue hiding. I, Xiao Yan, will definitely turn this place into a bloodbath today!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, what arrogant words. Do you really think that you can act as you like after reaching the Dou Sheng class? It is an extremely easy matter for my Hun clan to kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>An icy-cold snort was emitted from deep within the large hall after Xiao Yan\u2019s voice sounded. A dense, black fog erupted from within the hall. A skinny skeleton-like elderly figure slowly walked out with a dark, dense aura!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

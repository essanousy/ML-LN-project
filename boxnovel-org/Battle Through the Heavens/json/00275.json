At that moment, amusement and shock flashed across her exquisite and pretty face. She then covered her mouth immediately and laughed in a tender voice, \u201cXiao Yan di-di, after not seeing you for three years, not only have you become mature, you have also become much more shy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have always been very shy.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded his head and said seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou weren\u2019t like this three years ago. Has Xiao Yan di-di forgotten? Back then when I recognized your identity you were extremely boorish.\u201d A smile flashed across Ya Fei\u2019s beautiful peach blossom eyes as she said.</p><br/><p>Eyeing Ya Fei who was emitting an enchanting temptation between her smile and frown, Xiao Yan felt somewhat helpless. After three years of training, this matured woman appeared to have become increasingly enchanting. Perhaps it was because of her different status now, but when she spoke to him, she did not have the cautiousness back then. Instead, having met as old friends, their relationship became somewhat more affectionate.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour intention for coming to the Jia Ma Sacred City\u2026 should be due to that agreement, right?\u201d The smile on Ya Fei\u2019s smile was slowly withdrawn as she stared at Xiao Yan in front of her and inquired softly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded slightly. He said, \u201cWho asked the blood to rush to my brain back then, resulting in me making that agreement. These three years, I have endured quite a lot of hardships because of that agreement.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ya Fei eyed Xiao Yan\u2019s face, which had less sentimentality and innocence. Instead, it held more maturity and seriousness compared to three years ago. She sighed. Although Xiao Yan did not tell her about his experiences during these three years in detail, she clearly knew in her heart that he must have endured hardships that others would have difficulty even imagining.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan di-di, after three years of training, I think that you should have a clear picture of the strength that the Misty Cloud Sect has in the Jia Ma Empire.\u201d Ya Fei frowned and said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am clear. It is a really big being which would only require one finger to destroy our Xiao clan.\u201d Xiao Yan calmly said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh.\u201d Eyeing that calm face which had no ripple, Ya Fei helplessly shook her head and said, \u201cIt has been three years, yet you still have such a stubborn character. However, you can rest assured that with the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s position and status, they would not hurt the Xiao clan even if they had a deep and terrible annoyance with you. The arrogant old fellows of the Misty Cloud Sect won\u2019t throw their face away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they dare to touch the Xiao clan\u2026 I will dare to go missing for ten years and then come out to kill everyone in the Misty Cloud Sect.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled slightly. His smile was noticeably thick and cold.</p><br/><p>Being pierced by the dark and cold killing intent that had suddenly swarmed into Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes, Ya Fei felt her body become somewhat numb. Her hands involuntarily crossed in front of her chest. This sudden action of hers, however, caused the surrounding \u2018animals\u2019 to have an impulse of hugging her into their chest and caress her with care.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I forgot that you don\u2019t really like to train.\u201d Recovering himself, Xiao Yan eyed the fragile looking manner of Ya Fei. He was briefly at a loss before he spoke apologetically.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said that I don\u2019t like to train? I am also a Dou Zhe, alright? It is just that your killing aura has become heavier after three years of training. It can even be compared to someone in our clan who had climbed out from a pile of corpses on the battlefield.\u201d Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words, Ya Fei immediately threw a look of disdain at Xiao Yan and said with dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? These clothes of yours\u2026 you have actually become a tier two alchemist?\u201d Ya Fei\u2019s shifting gaze suddenly paused at the chest of Xiao Yan\u2019s long alchemist robe. When she saw the occupational tier badge, she could not help but let out an involuntary cry of shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I was merely lucky.\u201d Xiao Yan carelessly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cLucky? Ah, for an ordinary person, advancing from a beginner into a tier two alchemist is impossible without at least five to six years of time. Yet, you have reached this step in three years. I\u2019m afraid that is not mere luck.\u201d Eyeing the young man who revealed something shocking at every instance, Ya Fei sighed helplessly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shook his head and smiled. He did not continue to pursue this question. Instead, his gaze swept across the hall, realizing that he and Ya Fei had already become the center of attention. Immediately, he whispered, \u201cAre you currently in charge of this auction house?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese words of yours really gives me a blow\u2026\u201d Hearing this, Ya Fei sighed, feeling a little depressed. She smiled bitterly and replied, \u201cThe authority for this auction house headquarters is completely in the hands of those old fellows in the clan. This is their lifeblood. How is it possible that they would let me manage it? Currently, I am only the Supervising Acting Elder here.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she glanced at Xiao Yan, Ya Fei quickly smiled and said, \u201cAlthough I am not in charge of this place, but at the very least, I also have a portion of the rights that come with my position. I don\u2019t think that your purpose for coming here was to look for me, right? What do you need?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan we find a quiet place to talk?\u201d Xiao Yan scanned the large crowd around him who had their ears lifted vertically and helplessly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, follow me.\u201d Ya Fei smiled and nodded her head. She had just turned around when her gaze suddenly drifted to Hai Bo Dong, who was behind Xiao yan and leaning against a crystal counter while watching the items in boredom. After hesitating for a moment, she asked, \u201cIs this Old Sir together with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Do you want to converse alone and leave my old self aside? Is it going to be something shady?\u201d Although Ya Fei\u2019s voice was soft, Hai Bo Dong still managed to catch her words. He turned around and laughed.</p><br/><p>Being teased by Hai Bo Dong in such a manner, a faint redness swarmed onto Ya Fei\u2019s exquisite face. However, it was fortunate that she was extremely good at handling issues with human relations. She gave an immediate sweet smile and said, \u201cWhat is old sir saying, there\u2019s no reason for our auction house to leave people aside when doing business.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle girl\u2019s mouth is really eloquent. However, I am not those fools who only think about women every day. I\u2019m poor and cannot afford to take out the money to buy the things here.\u201d Hai Bo Dong laughed.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, shock flashed across Ya Fei\u2019s eyes. However, the expression on her face continued to maintain a smile. Although her strength was lousy, it did not mean that her eyes were poor. She really could not see through Hai Bo Dong\u2019s strength but she was able to vaguely tell that the old man in front of her was not an ordinary old person. That was sufficient.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have spent a long time hurrying on our journey here. He\u2019s just bored, you can simply ignore him.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled at Ya Fei.</p><br/><p>Ya Fei smiled. She turned around and slowly walked toward a staircase in one corner of the hall. Her heels stepped on the shiny and clean bluestone ground surface, emitting a \u2018click-clack\u2019 sound. Her elegant pace caused people to be unable not fall into a deep longing for her.</p><br/><p>After his gaze swept over her alluring back, Xiao Yan swiftly followed her under the observation of numerous heated gazes in the hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that the old man is your mysterious teacher from back then?\u201d Facing the front, Ya Fei softly asked without anyone noticing as she wore a smile on her face and nodded toward those who had greeted her.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Hearing this, Ya Fei slightly nodded her head. She instantly stopped talking and led the two of them slowly toward a staircase with a few guards present.</p><br/><p>Eyeing Xiao Yan and Hai Bo Dong following behind, the few guards eyed each other. According to the rules, people who were not members of the clan were usually not allowed to enter. However, Ya Fei was currently holding the post of Supervising Acting Elder. Her authority was quite great. At that moment, none of them dared to stop them. Only when the three of them were about to enter did a guard have no choice but to bite the bullet and take a step forward. However, before he spoke, Ya Fei gave him a faint glance, which caused him to swallow the words in his throat. He smiled bitterly and stepped back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are my friends. If something happens, I will take responsibility.\u201d Ya Fei said those words in an indifferent voice before leading Xiao Yan and Hai Bo Dong up the stairs. However, something at the top of the stairs suddenly caused her eyebrows to inadvertently knit slightly together.</p><br/><p>Following the rumbling of footsteps, a few human figures slowly appeared at the bending corner of the stairs. The man who was leading them was around the same age as Ya Fei. His somewhat pale-white face was clearly a result of overindulgence in carnal pleasures. Although the build of this person did not appear strong, he was actually a strong person who had just entered the Dou Shi class not long ago based on the Qi that his body faintly emitted.</p><br/><p>The pale-faced young man\u2019s gaze carried some converting and desire as it drifted over the stairs to see Ya Fei below. Observing the lower ground from a higher position, the latter\u2019s curves were coincidentally perfectly highlighted. Instantly, that young man\u2019s breathing became slightly erratic.</p><br/><p>Sensing the change in the young man above, Ya Fei\u2019s pretty face became slightly ugly. She lifted her head and coldly glanced at the young man. The spring water like pupils that had originally maintained a smile had a disgust that was difficult to hide at the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, Ya Fei, this place is where our clan conducts official business. Other people are not allowed to enter. Don\u2019t tell me that you, as the Acting Supervising Elder, you don\u2019t even know this?\u201d Watching the disgust of Ya Fei in his eyes, the young man\u2019s face immediately became much gloomier. His training talent could be considered quite good within the Primer clan. However, this qualification which could cause other ladies to adore him greatly, merely provoked a greater disgust from Ya Fei. This caused the haughty him to really feel unbearable.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already said, if something goes wrong, I will take responsibility. Please move aside!\u201d Ya Fei\u2019s cold voice did not give the other party any face. She pulled Xiao Yan\u2019s hand and started climbing the stairs.</p><br/><p>Being ignored in such a manner in front of his subordinates, the corner of the mouth of the pale-faced young man twitched. This was especially so when Ya Fei grabbed Xiao Yan\u2019s hand. An unknown jealous flame instantly rose in his eyes. Although Ya Fei was usually full of smiles, appearing very approachable, he knew that this woman\u2019s heart had a certain discrimination against men. It was extremely rare for one to see her taking the initiative to pull a man's hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, I wondered why she usually treats me so coldly. It seems that you actually like this kind of unripe young man. What good taste. But I wonder if he can satisfy you?\u201d Glancing at Xiao Yan\u2019s calm face, the young man could not help but ridicule him.</p><br/><p>Ya Fei was expressionless as she climbed the stairs as though she had not heard the obscene words of the young man. However, Xiao Yan, whose hand was being tightly held by her, could sense that her nails had already viciously clawed into his palm.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan, who had unluckily suffered from the trouble other people\u2019s affairs, helplessly shook his head. He glanced at the pale-faced young man with eyes that were so indifferent, they did not have the slightest emotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, do you want to die?\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan's eyes which put him in an extremely bad mood, the young man immediately became furious. His voice was dark and cold as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan\u2019s footsteps paused. His arm, however, was pulled. Ya Fei in front of him shook her head slightly, indicating for him to ignore the matter.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Xiao Yan sighed and shook his head. He then nodded and followed.</p><br/><p>\u201cQi, soft\u2026 Ya Fei, your standards are really terrible. If you really need a young man, I think you need not find someone like that, no?\u201d Ya Fei\u2019s patience ended up causing the young man to become even more vicious. He opened his mouth and viciously laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan once again paused his walking footsteps. His hand trembled slightly as he shook his hand that was being pulled by Ya Fei free. After which, he eyed the moving outline of Ya Fei\u2019s back, shrugged his shoulders and said indifferently, \u201cYou can even endure this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ya Fei\u2019s body stiffened. She did not speak. Her fragile back appeared somewhat weary.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I cannot\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan waved his hand, suddenly turning around and staring darkly at the laughing young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful, he\u2019s a one star Dou Shi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeming to have sensed Xiao Yan\u2019s action, Ya Fei hurriedly turned around. However, before her shout fell, an explosion suddenly rang at the stairs, causing her pretty face to be completely stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou damn bastard. Do you eat dog\u2019s sh*t in order to grow?\u201d Following the energy explosion, Xiao Yan\u2019s similarly dark, cold and vicious curses rang in the stairway.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

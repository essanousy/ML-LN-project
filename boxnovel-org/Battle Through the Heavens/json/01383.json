The blood of those within his aura boiled at this moment, regardless of whether or not they were from the Yan Alliance or Profound Lion Sect. Immediately, one could hear a \u201cbang, bang, bang\u201d sound as countless numbers of bodies exploded. A pool of bloody pulp dyed the ground until it was incomparably red.</p><br/><p>This indiscriminate killing by the fourth Tianzun naturally shocked both parties. Those people close to the abyss hurriedly pulled back. Within a short instant, the entire area had become empty.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, what are you doing? Don\u2019t tell me that you have forgotten our agreement?\u201d</p><br/><p>A short distance away, Shi Tian, who had been seriously injured by a strike from Xiao Yan, had finally caught his breath at this moment. He immediately became furious and cried out loud when he saw the fourth Tianzun began to kill people from the Profound Lion Sect\u2019s army.</p><br/><p>The fourth Tianzun floated over the sea of blood. His eyes were indifferent as they glanced at Shi Tian, who had cried out furiously. He slowly raised his hand and point it at Shi Tian from some distance away before abruptly clenching his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shi Tian\u2019s furious cry suddenly halted the when fourth Tianzun clenched his hand. Shi Toan\u2019s body exploded in an instant, causing blood to shoot out in all directions.</p><br/><p>The faces of the Profound Lion Sect\u2019s experts were greatly shocked when they saw that this person had killed even the chief of the Profound Lion Sect. Although, they were extremely furious, none of them dared to let out an angry cry. Even Shi Tian was unable to block a random palm from the fourth Tianzun. Even less needed to be said for them, and some of the experts in the Profound Lion Sect\u2019s camp had been threatened and lured over to the Hall of Souls. They could not be called loyal to the Profound Lion Sect anymore. Naturally, they would not take the initiative to help them.</p><br/><p>\u201cPull back the Yan Alliance\u2019s front line. This fellow experiences mood swings. In any case, it would be a suicidal for an ordinary army to get involved\u2026\u201d Cai Lin knit her brows and ordered in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Xiao Ding and Xiao Li by the side nodded when they heard her command. They quickly relayed her orders to swiftly withdraw all soldiers outside of the fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, we can only hope that Xiao Yan will be able to deal with this person. Otherwise, the Mysterious Yellow Fortress will not avoid a terrible bloodshed\u2026\u201d Hai Bodong spoke with a grave face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye\u2026\u201d Even Cai Lin could only nod her head when she heard these words. The strength of that so-called fourth Tianzun was obviously great. None of the people present could contend with him. Hence, they could only place all their hope on Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan in the sky frowned as he watched the fourth Tianzun randomly cause a person\u2019s body to self-destruct. An expression of contemplation flashed across his eyes. \u201cThis person is called Xue He Tianzun (Blood River Tianzun). Moreover, he also knows the Blood Transforming Grand Skill. He probably can control the blood in a person\u2019s body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had come across experts who could control the blood of another person. However, none of them had been as tough as this fourth Tianzun. A six star Dou Zun\u2019s body had exploded with a flick of his hand. Although Shi Tian\u2019s serious injures factored in, the mysterious technique of the fourth Tianzun was the main reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cSplash!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sea of blood suddenly rippled while Xiao Yan was thinking to himself. The fourth Tianzun stepped forward and walked through empty air. He took a step at a time and finally stopped a short distance away from Xiao Yan. His blood-colored hair fluttered and a bloody scent quietly spread across the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeak of an eight star Dou Zun. This is indeed quite strong\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth Tianzun studied Xiao Yan. An ugly smile rose onto his face as he lifted his hand and violent clenched it in Xiao Yan\u2019s direction. The space in front of the fourth Tianzun immediately became distorted after he clenched his hand.</p><br/><p>A thought passed through Xiao Yan\u2019s heart as he observed the fourth Tianzun with a frown. A majestic Dou Qi broke from his body. The Dou Qi transformed into a fierce flame that wrapped around him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDou Qi will not be able to block my Blood Transforming Grand Skill\u2026\u201d The fourth Tianzun laughed in a hoarse voice when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s Dou Qi.</p><br/><p>The fourth Tianzun\u2019s words had just sounded when Xiao Yan sensed the blood within his body began to churn uncontrollably. He could vaguely feel that his blood was about to burst from their vessels.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed slightly when he sensed the transformation occurring in his body. This fellow\u2019s so-called Blood Transforming Grand Skill was indeed unique. However, Xiao Yan was about to suppress the churning blood within his body when his heart suddenly pounded. He quickly noticed a strange strength spreading from his heart. Finally, this strength spread to his blood vessels, and the boiling feeling disappeared almost the moment the strength came into contact with his blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 the merged bloodline from the Heavenly Tomb?\u201d</p><br/><p>This change caused Xiao Yan to feel startled as some surprise flashed across his eyes. It was unexpected that this newly formed bloodline was this powerful. Even the fourth Tianzun\u2019s Blood Transforming Grand Skill was unable to effect it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like your Blood Transforming Grand Skill is not as strong as you described it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lifted his head after sensing the blood gradually calming within his body. He smiled at the fourth Tianzun while he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth Tianzun was startled when there was no response from Xiao Yan\u2019s body. He frowned. This Blood Transforming Grand Skill was a Tian class Dou Skill. Even some elite Ban Shengs would be affected by it, causing them to split their attention to suppress it. Why was it that this skill was completely useless against Xiao Yan?</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly smiled. Both of his hands quickly formed many mysterious seals. After the formation of these seals, a mysterious clan tattoo slowly appeared on his brows.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao clan\u2019s clan tattoo? You have actually activated the Xiao clan\u2019s bloodline?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth Tianzun was startled when he saw the clan tattoo on Xiao Yan\u2019s brows. The Xiao clan\u2019s bloodline had already been wasted, everyone knew that. Why could Xiao Yan summon the clan tattoo?</p><br/><p>No one could answer the fourth Tianzun question. Xiao Yan\u2019s aura suddenly soared when the clan tattoo appeared. Within a short instant, it was no longer inferior to the fourth Tianzun\u2019s aura. The strengthening effect of the clan tattoo was perfectly displayed at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan comfortably inhaled a mouthful of air as he sensed the surging Dou Qi from within his body. He immediately lifted his head and smiled at the frowning fourth Tianzun. His foot stepped forward, and his body vanished the moment his foot landed.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though the Blood Transforming Grand Skill is useless against you, I am still able to sense the flow of the blood in your body to determine your position. Therefore, your speed is useless against me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth Tianzun coldly laughed when he saw Xiao Yan vanish. He swiftly took three steps back as wave after wave of blood-red Dou Qi flowed out of his body and gathered into a thick blood cuticle on his palm. He then ruthlessly smashed it toward the empty space to the right, \u201cCome out!\u201d</p><br/><p>A stench-filled palm wind arrived and the space immediately became distorted. A figure also appeared. It was Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan\u2019s position was detected, he did not show any signs of dodging. Instead, he stepped forward and allowed the fourth Tianzun\u2019s attack to land on his chest. At the same time, a hot fist suddenly whizzed out. Its swiftness did not allow time for any reactions. The palm wind ruthlessly struck the fourth Tianzun\u2019s body. This fighting method did not involve any skill. It was a literal exchange of blows.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fists of the two ruthlessly landed on the other party\u2019s body. However, Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders merely shook after receiving a blow from the fourth Tianzun. His expression was not altered. On the other hand, the fourth Tianzun was forced a couple of steps back by Xiao Yan\u2019s punch. His throat also emitted a moan. Xiao Yan\u2019s incomparably hot fist wind was too much for him to endure.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that you will not be able to endure if we exchange blows in this manner\u2026\u201d Xiao yan flicked his clothes with a smiling face and softly commented.</p><br/><p>The fourth Tianzun\u2019s face was gloomy. His eyes stared at the cloth on Xiao Yan\u2019s body. After having exchanged blows, he was naturally aware that his attack had mostly been absorbed by that strange cloth earlier. However, he could not understand why the remaining force didn\u2019t harm Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>The rest of the attack had naturally been absorbed by the Dragon Phoenix Ancient Armor hidden in Xiao Yan\u2019s skin, but such a secret would never be understood by the fourth Tianzun no matter how he thought about it. Not only were Xiao Yan\u2019s clothes strange, but even his skin was extremely mysterious.</p><br/><p>The fourth Tianzun stared at Xiao Yan in a dark and solemn manner. Xiao Yan was immune to his attacks, but he wasn\u2019t able to ignore the other party\u2019s attacks. Such a battle really caused one to feel stifled.</p><br/><p>However, this fourth Tianzun was not an ordinary person. He was aware that his attack from earlier did not harm Xiao Yan. The only reason was that its strength was insufficient. Since this strength was lacking, he should use a greater strength to smash Xiao Yan into dregs!</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood Transforming Grand Skill, Great Devouring Blood Technique!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fourth Tianzun\u2019s face was ferocious. A sinister cry resounded over the land like thunder. After this cry sounded, the bodies of anyone weaker than an elite Dou Zun within a ten-thousand-foot radius exploded at this moment. They transformed into blood that continuously poured into the fourth Tianzun\u2019s body. At the same time, the sea of blood in the abyss below began to whistle as it transformed into a monstrous bloody wave that surged into his body.</p><br/><p>While the fourth Tiansun was devouring all this blood, his originally still aura started to diverge. After which, it slowly soared.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, do not threaten this venerable self. Today, I will capture all the blood of your Xiao clan along with the bloodline that you have activated!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sky was altered as the sea of blood spread. A sinister voice that was accompanied by a frightening pressure that pervaded the sky!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

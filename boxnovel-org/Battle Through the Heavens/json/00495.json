The setting sun descending in the west scattered the pale-red light into the window, forming a dense light spot on the ground.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sat up in the chair, and eyed the blanket that covered his body. His heart felt a slight warmth. He stood up and walked a little to move his body a little. After having slept until he was satisfied, the earlier tiredness had vanished. Replacing it was a face filled with energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cCreak\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While Xiao Yan was walking back and forth, the door was suddenly gently pushed open. A human head was carefully extended inside. Upon seeing that Xiao Yan had woken up, he finally sighed in relief. He laughed and said, \u201cChief, you can really sleep. You have slept all the way from morning to night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, so it\u2019s Atai.\u201d Xiao Yan could not help but laugh softly when he saw the person who stuck his head out. He beckoned with his hand to ask the latter to come in and smiled as he asked, \u201cHas Xun Er and the others not returned yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, that\u2019s right. Senior Xun Er and the others brought nearly everyone away from \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate.\u2019 Looking at the time, however, they should be back soon.\u201d Atai rubbed his head and smiled as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really thanks to all of you this time around.\u201d Xiao Yan lifted a cup of cold tea beside him and took a shallow sip before softly speaking to Atai with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, you are being too polite. Now, everyone is a member of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate.\u2019 All of the members have received your protection, how can we not do anything?\u201d Atai responded awkwardly. He was shocked at the favor he felt when Xiao Yan voiced his thanks.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince I have decided to establish this \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 back then, I naturally need to take responsibility of all these matters. Once the medicinal pills are sold, I will let Xun Er repay all of you twice the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 that you all have donated. Business issues are business issues and personal issues are personal issues. They cannot be mixed.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head and voiced his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Atai was just about to defer the matter when he suddenly heard the sound of a large number of footsteps outside the door. His face immediately rejoiced. \u201cSenior Xun Er and the rest are back!\u201d</p><br/><p>His words had just sounded when the door was once again pushed opened. A large group of joyous people swarmed in. Xun Er, Hu Jia, and Wu Hao were leading them. From the looks of their happy faces, it appeared that they had quite a good result.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, you have awoken?\u201d Xun Er chided everyone to be quiet upon entering the room when she saw Xiao Yan sitting in the chair. She immediately spoke happily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded as he said, \u201cTake a seat and rest first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Xiao Yan was still calm, Xun Er curled her lips into a shallow smile as she, along with the excited faced Wu Hao and Hu Jia, sat down beside Xiao Yan. The other members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 sat on the ground because there were insufficient seats. In an instant, the originally spacious large hall was immediately packed until it was full.</p><br/><p>Seeing that everyone had sat down, Xiao Yan finally turned his gaze toward Xun Er and smiled as he asked, \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad\u2026\u201d Xun Er laughed softly before speaking, \u201cWe have sold thirty \u2018Energy Recovery Pills\u2019 and thirty-five \u2018Body Healing Pills.\u2019 As for the \u2018Quiet Ice Pills,\u2019 we have sold a lot less. We only sold fourteen of them\u2026 As there is the problem of credibility initially, we have decided that the \u2018Energy Recovery Pill\u2019 is priced at one day of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 each, a little cheaper than the \u2018Return Spring Pill\u2019 of the \u2018Medicine Gang.\u2019 The \u2018Body Recovery Pill\u2019 is also priced at one day of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 each. As for the \u2018Quiet Ice Pill,\u2019 it is priced at three days of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 each. By counting in this manner, we have sold the pills for a total of one hundred seven days of \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019 We are fast reaching the capital that we have taken out. Selling medicinal pills is indeed lucrative. No wonder alchemists are ultimately the most admired and envious occupation in the entire continent.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan brows were slightly knit when he initially heard the amount that was sold. His heart immediately felt relief as he spoke softly, \u201cIt is indeed considered not bad. Our \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 is selling medicinal pills for the first time and does not have any credibility. It is very difficult for other people to trust the effects of the medicinal pills that we sell. The price does indeed need to be a little lower. As for that \u2018Quiet Ice Pill,\u2019 its price is a little high and an ordinary student would really be reluctant to purchase it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan quietly laughed at the last few words that Xun Er spoke. If it was not because he had the help of the \u2018Heavenly Flame,\u2019 which greatly increased the success rate of forming pills, an ordinary alchemist would have difficulty obtaining this kind of profit even though they might be able to earn something.</p><br/><p>\u201cOriginally, we never hoped that everyone would be able to purchase it\u2026\u201d Xun Er smiled and said, \u201cThose ten students who purchased the \u2018Quiet Ice Pill\u2019 were quite strong. Moreover, they do not lack these three days of \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019 Therefore, they purchased it skeptically to try it. However, I think that after we wait one to two days, these medicinal pills might be snapped up in an instant.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded his head. As long as their credibility and the effect of the medicinal pill was spread around, it was likely that there would be people automatically coming to purchase even if they did not go out and sell.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, I suggest that we should first purchase the medicinal ingredients with all of the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 that we have earned through the first batch\u2026 currently, the \u2018Medicine Gang\u2019 has not had a reaction due to our sudden actions. However, once they discover them, it is likely that they will take action.\u201d Xun Er hesitated for a moment before suggesting.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are afraid that the \u2018Medicine Gang\u2019 will quietly purchase all of the medicinal ingredients?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. His brows were immediately tightly knit together.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how one put it, the foundation of the \u2018Medicine Gang\u2019 is much firmer than ours. After selling medicinal pills for so many years, they have become so fat that they are overflowing with oil. If they really want to cut off the source of our medicinal pills, we would really have some trouble. After all, they\u2026 really have the financial ability. Hence, we must take precautions.\u201d Xun Er voiced her thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, you are right.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded heavily as he said in a deep voice, \u201cWe really cannot underestimate this \u2018Medicine Gang.\u2019 From tomorrow on, send everyone out to purchase the medicinal ingredients that we need!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly exhaled a breath of air as he stood up. His gaze swept across the members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 within the hall. He smiled and said, \u201cEveryone has worked hard. All the members that have participated in today\u2019s sale will each be able to obtain five days of \u2018Fire Energy!\u2019 Once we have sold the medicinal pills! I, Xiao Yan, will do what I say and will not eat my words!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLong live the Chief!\u201d</p><br/><p>All the members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 in the hall were initially startled when they heard Xiao Yan speak of such a grand and great reward. Immediately, their faces were filled with a wild joy. Their excited roars nearly tore apart the ceiling. There were nearly forty to fifty members within \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019. If each person was to be rewarded with five days of \u2018Fire Energy,\u2019 that meant that one had to take out over two hundred days of \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019 This generosity could be considered extremely lavish even if it was placed in the entire Inner Academy.</p><br/><p>If it was in the past, Xiao Yan would naturally not be able to take out such a large sum. However, now that they were selling medicinal pills, and with his refining skills, \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 would sooner or later flow in endlessly. Hence, he naturally did not need to be stingy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for Atai and the others who donated \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 to purchase medicinal ingredients, they will be repaid twice the amount at that time. Remember, everyone is not allowed to refuse!\u201d Xiao Yan once again turned his gaze toward Atai and the others as he spoke in a clear voice.</p><br/><p>Those members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 could only smile bitterly and nod their heads after being blocked by Xiao Yan\u2019s words. However, they were also a little moved as they smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>Xun Er and the other two could not help but exchange glances with one another as they eyed the high morale displayed by the members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 under Xiao Yan\u2019s hefty reward. The morale was so high that it could not become any higher. After which, each of them quietly gave Xiao Yan a thumbs up.</p><br/><p>On the second day, the members of \u2018Pan Gate\u2019 divided their workforce. Xun Er and the other two still led some people to sell medicinal pills while Xiao Yan led some people to the Exchange Area. He basically spent all of the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 in his hands to purchase the necessary medicinal ingredients to refine the three kinds of medicinal pills. He then led everyone back to the new student area after he had bought enough.</p><br/><p>The sale situation on Xun Er\u2019s and the other\u2019s side was nearly double what it was yesterday. Some of those people who had consumed the pleasantness of the medicinal pills quietly and secretly told their friends about it. Although they severely told the others not to spread around in their selfishness, the name of the three types of medicinal pills had already transmitted throughout the entire Inner Academy within just a short night. This was especially the case for the \u2018Quiet Ice Pill.\u2019 The effect of it, enabling one to increase the time one could train in the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,\u2019 caused some people\u2019s eyes to turn red on the spot.</p><br/><p>By the time Xun Er and the rest returned after the second day, most of the first batch of medicinal pills that were refined had already been completely sold. The large amount of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 that had reached their hands caused the entire \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 to descend into excitement.</p><br/><p>Over ten people were seated in the spacious, luxurious large hall. The atmosphere was somewhat depressing, and had some faint dark waves flowing around. A man wearing an alchemist robe was sitting in the chair at the leader\u2019s position of a large table. There was an ancient medicinal cauldron drawn on his chest. The surface of the cauldron had four flashing ripples. The eye-piercing glow from it caused the other ten plus people in the room to lack the courage to look at him directly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho can tell me just when an alchemist appeared in this \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate?\u2019\u201d The man finally opened his mouth slowly after the silent atmosphere continued for a long while. His low voice contained some anger. At this moment, three medicinal pills were placed in front of him. It was the three types of medicinal pills that Xiao Yan\u2019s group sold.</p><br/><p>\u201cRumor has it that their leader, who is also that Xiao Yan, refined them\u2026\u201d A person below softly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is actually also an alchemist?\u201d The man knit his eyebrows and questioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi\u2026 from the looks of it, he should be one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEach of these three types of medicinal pills is better than any of those that we sell. They are also cheaper\u2026\u201d The man stared at the medicinal pills in front of him and said in a dark and cold voice, \u201cIf we allow their reputation to spread completely, I\u2019m afraid that our monopoly on the sale of medicinal pills will be directly overturned.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do now? We cannot just sit here and watch while they become stronger, right?\u201d A person said in a somewhat fiery manner.</p><br/><p>The man ignored the noise below. His finger gently tapped on the surface of the table. After a long while he finally said in a dark and cold voice, \u201cInvestigate the medicinal ingredients that they are purchasing. We will use twice the price to buy whatever they bought\u2026 Our \u2018Medicine Gang\u2019 does not have many things, but we do have a lot of \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes sir!\u201d Upon hearing their leader speak, the noisy people below immediately responded in unison.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 seems to have some conflict with the \u2018White Gang\u2019, right?\u201d The man appeared to have recalled something as he said faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is rumored that Xiao Yan had once defeated Fu Ao. Moreover, he publicly had a conflict with Bai Cheng\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, what a group of arrogant new students\u2026 Go and find someone to invite Chief Bai Cheng over. I have some matters that I wish to discuss with him\u2026 This \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 really doesn\u2019t know the immensity of the Heavens and Earth. Can one Xiao Yan overturn the sky?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

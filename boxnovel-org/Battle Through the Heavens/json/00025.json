He carefully placed them in the cabinet and deeply sniffed the smell of herbs as he smiled with relief.</p><br/><p>To practice uninterrupted, Xiao Yan had purchased the amount of herbs needed for 8 months of usage, allowing him to practice non-stop for the rest of the year.</p><br/><p>As he affectionately patted the cabinet, his lips cracked open and he lazily goes on the side of his bed, putting his head down. Today\u2019s activities had made him really tired</p><br/><p>\u201cYan Er, are you there?\u201d A mumbled voice and a knock pass through his door..</p><br/><p>Opening his blurry eyes, Xiao Yan hurriedly jumped out of his bed, then opened his room\u2019s door, looking at Xiao Zhao outside of the door and asked: \u201cFather, do you need something?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t I see for you even if I don\u2019t need anything from you? You kid, you hid from me for 2 months.\u201d Xiao Zhan reprimanded as he rubbed Xiao Yan\u2019s head affectionately.</p><br/><p>Looking at Xiao Zhan\u2019s warm smiling face, Xiao Yan\u2019s was moved as he pumped his sore nose, not knowing what to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you still feeling responsible for that ? Haha, if she can\u2019t take a liking to my son, it is her loss. You don\u2019t have to be sad. Why should a great man act like a little kid? I know that this son of Xiao Zhan, is not a cripple.\u201d Xiao Zhan boldly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha father, after 3 years, Yan Er will go to the Faction of Misty Clouds personally.\u201d Xiao Yan said in a soft voice with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhao\u2019s smiling face became more serious, as he stared at Xiao Yan. After a while, he said with some hesitation: \u201cFather feels fine, but\u2026 are you really going to? Father isn\u2019t saying that you can\u2019t reach Nalan Yanran, but the strength of the Faction of Misty Clouds\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled as he nodded, his thin lips forcing a somewhat stubborn line: \u201cFather, that there are some things, that as a man, I have to bear.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAha, this temper of your resembles mine much, if your two big brothers knew that you thought like this, they would probably be very happy\u201d, Towards Xiao Yan\u2019s dedication, Xiao Zhan smiled pleased before sighing and nodded heavily: \u201cGood, father waits for his son to give him some face, I want the old bastard Nalan Shu to beg me to remake that marriage promise.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded and couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I\u2019ll give you this, consider it as your father\u2019s support.\u201d He handed to Xiao Yan a very familiar white bottle.</p><br/><p>Looking at this elixir that went back to his own hands, Xian Yan didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or to cry. But on his face, he maintained a puzzled expression : \u201cFather, this is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFoundation Elixir, it\u2019ll accelerate your Dou Qi cultivation, I just bought it today.\u201d Xiao Zhan\u2019s mouth smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must have spent a lot of money for this right?\u201d As he received the white jade bottle, Xiao Yan\u2019s heart felt warm.</p><br/><p>\u201c40 000 gold coins, but if it can be of use to you, it is worth its price \u201d Xiao Zhan smiled as though he didn\u2019t care.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou spent 40 000 gold coins for buying me this foundation spirit elixir? Won\u2019t the elders perhaps cause trouble to you using this excuse?\u201d Xiao Yan smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTssk, I am the Clan Leader, they can at most utter some words\u201d Xiao Zhan said coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFather, thank you, during the adult ceremony in one year, I will make them shut their mouth completely\u201d. Xiao Yan calmly laughed as he said that.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, I am waiting for my son to transform once more !\u201d Although he didn\u2019t know from where Xiao Yan\u2019s confidence came from, Xiao Zhan was very happy seeing his son\u2019s confident appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I won\u2019t disturb your rest. If there are any problems come and see your father, as a family member, I cannot let you be disgraced.\u201d Waving his hand, Xiao Zhan turned around, as he took big strides leaving the front yard.</p><br/><p>\u201cShit, I also have to face these old fools now. I only spent 40 000 Gold Coins, but they will act like I had spent the money that was supposed to be used for buying their coffins.\u201d From the night, Xiao Zhan\u2019s mutters floated to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Looking at his father vanish into the darkness, Xiao Yan touched his nose and smiled while saying in a low voice:\u201dRelax, father, I will use reality to make these people quiet. 3 years before, I could make them look up at me, 3 years after, I will still be able to !\u201d</p><br/><p>After standing at his door for a while, Xiao Yan put away the white jade bottle. Then, he shot a look at the corner of the room, teasing: \u201dGirl ! Is it fun to eavesdrop on people?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, that was keen from you\u2026\u2026.\u201d From the corner, a pretty young girl wearing a purple skirt came out elegantly. Leaning her little head, a big smile was revealed on her beautiful face.</p><br/><p>Looking at the mischievous girl\u2019s face, Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did Xiao Yan ge-ge go this afternoon?\u201d Xun Er came forward, walked up lightly and asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just on a little stroll.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so?\u201d Her eyes looking up and down, Xun Er suddenly took a step forward and bent slightly. Her nose wrinkled while she said: \u201cI smell the fragrance of a woman.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*, come on, why would I have a woman\u2019s fragrance.\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s immature face suddenly blushed, but in the dark, his as well as the girl\u2019s face couldn\u2019t be seen clearly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee.\u201d Seemingly liking this predicament Xiao Yan was in, Xun Er laughed and a moment later, stopped laughing. Before quietly saying : \u201dA moment ago, I also heard Xiao shu-shu\u2019s words, I believe that Xiao Yan ge\u2013ge, yup\u2026\u2026. In the future, you really want to go to the Faction of the Misty Clouds, Xun Er will come with you, to help you\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan blinked and tightly stared at the young girl\u2019s beautiful small face.</p><br/><p>Under Xiao Yan\u2019s unrestrained vision, Xun Er\u2019s her face flushed a little from shyness as she whispered :\u201dXiao Yan ge-ge, what are you looking at\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, Xun Er can also blush, such a rare sight.\u201d Xiao Yan unexpectedly said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xun Er coldly glanced at Xiao Yan and she muttered under her breath: \u201dAnd you can also glance at people this way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood, good, have confidence in ge-ge, although the Faction of Misty Clouds is formidable, I am still young. This Yun Yun who spoils that girl Nalan Yanran, definitely isn\u2019t too great of a teacher.\u201c Xiao Yan smiled as he rubbed the black hair of the young girl. \u201cWell, it is late, head back for a rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at Xiao Yan waving, Xun Er shakes her head reluctantly. And went into the darkness under his sight.</p><br/><p>After turning a corner, sounds could be heard from a quarrel between Xiao Zhan and the several elders. The topic of the quarrel: how the 40 000 gold coins were used.</p><br/><p>Stopping, Xun Er\u2019s little eyebrows wrinkled and she lets out a small sigh while a purple card appeared between her slim fingers.</p><br/><p>Her fingertips flicking the purple colored gold-card, making the purple-gold card flash into golden light as it soared towards the room where the elders are quarrelling with Xiao Zhan.</p><br/><p>The room suddenly became silent while Xun Er faintly said: \u201dThis is the money for the Foundation Elixir. In this card there are 100,000 gold coins, now that I\u2019ve given you this, I hope that you elders won\u2019t continue to give uncle Xiao trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>The room was completely silent before the \u201cyes\u201d acknowledgments from the three elders came through.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

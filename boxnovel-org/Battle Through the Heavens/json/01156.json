Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air as his hands suddenly moved. Numerous strange hand seals appeared. His hands danced and even formed afterimages. Following the changes of his hand seals, an invisible Spiritual Strength began to agglomerate on his palm in a lightning-like manner. Within the blink of an eye, it formed an invisible palmprint!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan flicked his finger the moment the palmprint was formed, and it scattered. Immediately, the seals formed by his hands continued to change. Soon after, two even more complicated palmprints appeared\u2026</p><br/><p>Three different palmprints appeared one after another in Xiao Yan\u2019s hands with great perfection. One could not find any flaws during the formation of the seals. This degree of familiarity was not weaker than what Cao Ying had displayed back then.</p><br/><p>The three spiritual prints surfaced before they were scattered by Xiao Yan. A mouthful of turbid air was also spat out of his mouth.</p><br/><p>A faint fluorescent light was lifted on Xiao Yan\u2019s face as the turbid air was spat out. It appeared just like warm jade before swiftly disappearing. His body moved, and he leaped down from the bed. After which, his body stood erect on the ground with his eyes shut\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shut his eyes for a moment before suddenly opening them. There was a faint joy within his eyes because he had discovered that the spiritual aura permeating his soul had become fuller than before without him realizing it. He could even vaguely sense a slight clogging feeling within his soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cCould this be that Soul State barrier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan pondered the thought. His intuition told him that the moment he passed through this clogging feeling, his soul would definitely step into the so-called Soul State!</p><br/><p>At that time, he would finally become a true alchemist guru!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s soon\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A smile surfaced on Xiao Yan\u2019s face. Based on this level, he had the confidence to truly break through the barrier!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled in his heart and arranged his clothes. After which, he pushed the door and exited the room. His gaze swept around and arrived on the Little Fairy Doctor, who was seated cross-legged outside of his door. Due to what had occurred before, she had become afraid of being too far from Xiao Yan. Even though they were in the Pill Tower, she continued to remain guard in this place when Xiao Yan entered his training state.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor swiftly opened her eyes when Xiao Yan pushed open the door. She turned her head and only sighed in relief after seeing that it was Xiao Yan. After which, she asked with a soft smile, \u201cAre you done training?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is been tough on you\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan grinned. He was naturally aware just how many days the Little Fairy Doctor had guarded him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you really wish to thank me, just these few words alone are not enough\u2026\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor sweetly smiled. However, she appeared to have sensed a deeper meaning in her words, causing her pretty face to turn slightly red. She hurriedly changed the conversation topic and said, \u201cIt has been a few days since you undertook your retreat. Cao Ying has come and looked for you once during this period of time, but I stopped her. You won\u2019t blame me for interrupting this great thing of yours will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor rolled her bright eyes when she finished speak. They finally paused on Xiao Yan\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily let out a bitter laugh when he heard the news. He said, \u201cI am not on familiar terms with her, what great thing can we have. Moreover, that woman is also not an ordinary person. I do not wish to be close to her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor nodded in satisfaction after hearing Xiao Yan put it this way. She curled her pretty eyes until they formed a crescent shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen will the Pill Gathering begin?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes swept over the large hall as he randomly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo soon?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled. It was unexpected that time had passed so quickly. In the blink of an eye, it was about time for the Pill Gathering to begin.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you did not wake yourself up today, I would have entered and woken you up a little later\u2026\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor informed him with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan tilted his head. He immediately fowned a little and said, \u201cI still have one medicinal ingredient that I have yet to obtain. It looks like I will need to think of a way to get my hands on it today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since Xiao Yan had obtained the two medicinal ingredients from the alchemist trade fair back then, he had yet to obtain any news about the last Ten Thousand Year Old Green Spiritual Vine until now. The Pill Gathering was fast approaching. This caused Xiao Yan to panic a little. After all, if he lacked this key ingredient, it would be impossible for him to truly refine the medicinal pill\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, there is no need for you to worry about medicinal ingredients\u2026\u201d The door of the hall was suddenly pushed open while Xiao Yan was frowning. Immediately, Ye Zhong, Xin Lan, and Tian Huo zun-zhe walked in.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhong smiled as he walked to Xiao Yan\u2019s side. He flicked his hand and a couple of jade boxes with cold air seeping from them appeared on the table in front of him. He said, \u201cThere are two Ten Thousand Year Old Green Spiritual Vine and a Blood Essence Demon Fruit here. Adding them to the medicinal ingredients you already have, you will coincidentally have two full sets. Even if you fail once during the refinement, you will still have a second chance.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He hurriedly grabbed a jade box and opened its cover. He did indeed see a jade-green emerald-like tree branch lying inside it. Dense life force spread out from it, giving one a relaxed and happy feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed the Ten Thousand Year Old Green Spiritual Vine. How did you obtain these things?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s face revealed his joy before he immediately asked somewhat uncertainly. These things were not ordinary items. Even with the collection of the Ye clan, the clan would not be able to take them out. However, there was suddenly two Ten Thousand Year Old Green Spiritual Vine and one Blood Essence Demon Fruit. This was a little strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese were not obtained by us. All I did was mention to an Elder from the Pill Tower that you needed these medicinal pills. They took the initiative to deliver these medicinal ingredients on the second day\u2026\u201d Ye Zhong smiled as he explained what happened.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled. He immediately came to a sudden understanding. Xuan Kong Zi\u2019s orders were behind all this. Otherwise, with his reputation, it was still too unknown for the Pill Tower to value him like this.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan thanked Xuan Kong Zi in his heart. He did not put up an act. He simply waved his hand and stored the medicinal ingredients in front of him into his Storage Ring. Currently, these were the most important things to him, and it was naturally impossible for him to reject them. He would treat it as owing Xuan Kong Zi a favor, and he would return it when he had the chance to in the future\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe number of people participating in this season\u2019s Pill Gathering will likely be the greatest number in all of its history. I heard that the inner region has been fully occupied by the countless numbers of competitors. Among them seem to be some renowned old demons. It seems that they are planning to thicken their skins and participate because of the Three Thousand Burning Flame\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. He was already aware that this season\u2019s Pill Gathering would definitely not be easy. Even he did not hold the thought of taking the champion spot. After all, the difficulty of this was really too great. All he could do was try his best\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026 if there is an opportunity, I really wish to fight with these great people from all over the continent. Teacher was a champion of one of the Pill Gatherings back then. Being his disciple, how can I end diminish his reputation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently lifted the corner of his mouth. Some heat that was difficult to hide flashed across his dark-black eyes. Regardless of how cool he was, he was still a young person. The hot blood of a young person similarly flowed in Xiao Yan\u2019s veins.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhong and the others exchanged glances with each other upon seeing the smile on Xiao Yan\u2019s face. After which, they grinned. It was likely that there would really be a good show with this season\u2019s Pill Gathering. Honestly speaking, they were really curious to know if this tiger, Xiao Yan, would meet an opponent who would be able to stop him.</p><br/><p>This Pill Gathering was really going to be an intense fight!</p><br/><p>When the first rays of morning sunlight scattered down the next and broke through the darkness that encompassed the land, Holy Pill City instantly began to boil\u2026</p><br/><p>All eyes would truly focus on Holy Pill City today. Everyone across the Central Plains would focus their eyes here, awaiting to see who would be able to stand out among the alchemist geniuses from all over the Dou Qi continent. The champion would undoubtedly be a child blessed by the Heavens!</p><br/><p>Every champion of the Pill Gathering would leave behind a well-known reputation in the Dou Qi continent\u2019s history without exception. Hence, the value of the Pill Gathering had been magnified by many times. Whoever could become the final champion would definitely be able to add a mark to the history of the Dou Qi continent in the future.</p><br/><p>That glory was enough to cause anyone to become crazy about. After all, who alive wished to be common\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCreak\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A door to a room within the Pill Tower was suddenly opened. At the same time, a skinny figure slowly stepped out of it. After which, he appeared in front of the eyes of the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s group, already waiting outside.</p><br/><p>Today, Xiao Yan was wearing a purple-colored alchemist robe that the Pill Tower had specifically gave him. There was a tier badge that the Pill Tower had issued on his chest. On the badge were seven purple-gold stars that were emitting bright lusters.</p><br/><p>This clothing was the most ceremonious clothes that Xiao Yan had worn in many years. From this, one could understand the position of the Pill Gathering in the hearts of the alchemists.</p><br/><p>A smile flashed across the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s eyes as she studied Xiao Yan. He appeared a little handsome as well as free and easy in his alchemist robes. This was the first time that she had seen Xiao Yan wearing such a formal outfit. However, it needed to be said that the current Xiao Yan looked really good.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently arranged his clothes. After which, he glanced at the Little Fairy Doctor and the rest. He smiled and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He took the lead to shift his footsteps after he spoke and walked out of the large hall. After which, the Little Fairy Doctor and the rest wisely smiled and swiftly followed.</p><br/><p>The Pill Gathering was the most noble gathering in the hearts of alchemists. Today, the gathering many alchemists admired and had gone crazy for finally parted its curtains\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had waited three years for this day!</p><br/><p>The eastern wind had arrived. It was time to flow with the wind!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Her gaze stared at the old man who had been playing with his teacup. Recalling the purple-gold card from earlier, she slowly calmed down.</p><br/><p>On the opposite side, Lei Ou also shifted his gaze toward Hai Bo Dong after Xiao Yan spoke. Seeing Hai Bo Dong\u2019s indifferent expression, Lei Ou\u2019s eyes shrunk. His head felt slightly uneasy as he asked in a soft and low voice, \u201cYou are?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hai Bo Dong slowly shook his head before looking up. His gaze was as indifferent as a ten thousand year ice glacier as he randomly glanced over Lei Bo. Immediately, he lowered his head to watch the teacup which had also been frozen over. After a brief silence, he said, \u201cPrimer Tengshan. That piece of trash is still alive, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The calm and indifferent voice was undoubtedly like thunder, violent and abrupt, making it\u2019s presence known next to the ears of those in the room excluding Xiao Yan and Ya Fei; shaking them until they became as dull as a wooden pillar.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh god! He\u2026 he actually speaks of the First Elder in such a manner? The First Elder is one of the Ten Strong in the Jia Ma Empire. Xiao Yan di-di, what exactly is the identity of this Old Sir?\u201d Opening her small mouth slightly, Ya Fei foolishly stared at Hai Bo Dong, who was seated in a chair. The First Elder who was viewed like a god in the Primer clan had actually became a piece of trash by his mouth\u2026 if these words were to be spread to the rest of the Primer clan, it would likely cause a fury.</p><br/><p>On the opposite side, Lei Ou and Lei Lei beside him were similarly stunned by these words of Hai Bo Dong. The corner of their mouths twitched slightly. Clearly, the impact these words had on them were far too great.</p><br/><p>\u201cCluck\u2026\u201d After being dull for a long while, Lei Ou finally began to gradually recover. He involuntarily swallowed his saliva. His eyes contained surprise and bewilderment as he stared at Hai Bo Dong. The tone he used to speak was clearly more polite, \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have the right to address me like that.\u201d Hai Bo Dong gently blew at the teacup which had turned into ice as he said blandly without even lifting his eyes.</p><br/><p>These extremely harsh words caused Lei Ou to be at a momentary loss. A lividness immediately surfaced on his old face. In the many years since he had become an elder, he had not had someone speak to him in such a manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn ten minutes, those medicinal ingredients that the girl had ordered earlier must appear in front of me. Otherwise, I don\u2019t mind having the Primer clan lose an elder.\u201d Hai Bo Dong ignored the livid faced Lei Ou. His tone was still as indifferent as it was at the beginning. At the same time, he did not leave any face for the other party.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou...your tone is far too arrogant! Do you know who my grandfather is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Lei Ou being rebuked in such a manner, a fury swarmed onto the pale-white face of Lei Lei beside him, who had never seen anyone dare to speak in such a manner to his grandfather. His anger had also suppressed the shock created by Hai Bo Dong a moment ago, and he could not help but neer coldly.</p><br/><p>Quickly after Lei Lei\u2019s words fell, a cold smile appeared on Xiao Yan\u2019s face. He softly said, \u201cReckless fellow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacup that was swaying slightly in Hai Bo Dong\u2019s hand slowly stopped. He lifted his head and shot his icy cold gaze at Lei Lei until the latter\u2019s face turned completely white. Being observed by everyone, Lei Lei was intending to stiffen his neck and speak again when he abruptly realized that Hai Bo Dong\u2019s body moved slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment that Hai Bo Dong\u2019s body moved, Lei Ou\u2019s eyes suddenly shrunk. His body moved horizontally and swiftly stopped in front of Lei Lei. After which, the Dou Qi in his body surged wildly before breaking free of his body and covering him.</p><br/><p>When Lei Ou\u2019s Dou Qi was summoned out, a white figure appeared to have teleported and appeared in front of him. That terrifying speed caused the former\u2019s eyes to shrink.</p><br/><p>The human figure stood still and a floating palm that carried an icy cold bone chilling force carelessly patted Lei Ou on the chest where his Dou Qi was amassing.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlug!\u201d</p><br/><p>It may have appeared like a seemingly careless pat, but it caused Lei Ou\u2019s expression to instantly become pale. A mouthful of fresh blood was wildly vomited. Immediately, the blood was agglomerated into a blood red icicle in midair and landed on the ground with a clear sound.</p><br/><p>The ferocious force caused Lei Ou\u2019s body to be shot backward. Instantly, he and Lei Lei heavily smashed into the wall. In seconds, the two of them were emitting waves of painful moans.</p><br/><p>The guards behind Lei Ou were stunned as they eyed Lei Ou who had been seriously injured with only one strike. Their hands which were holding onto their weapons trembled in fear. They actually forgotten their duty to protect their master.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandpa! Are you alright?\u201d Due to being protected by Lei Ou, Lei Lei did not receive very serious injuries. He climbed up with great difficulty. When he saw that Lei Ou\u2019s expression was even paler than his, he hurriedly called out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDou\u2026 Dou Huang?\u201d The cold Qi in his body caused Lei Ou\u2019s hair to actually be covered in thin frost layers. His mouth trembled as he suddenly stared at Hai Bo Dong and said with shock. A strong person who was able to cause Lei Ou serious injury without him being able to see the former\u2019s shadow. Lei Ou\u2019s heart clearly knew that only a Dou Huang was able to do such a thing.</p><br/><p>Hearing these few words, Lei Lei\u2019s body suddenly trembled intensely. A terror appeared on his face as he watched Hai Bo Dong. He did not expect that this humble looking old man would actually be a Dou Huang.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe ten minutes have already begun. I will definitely not take back the words that I have said. Ten minutes later, the medicinal ingredients must appear in front of me. Otherwise, even if Primer Tengshan appeared, you will die today!\u201d Hai Bo Dong glanced at the two of them as he indifferently and slowly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuick, quickly. Quickly go and bring the medicinal ingredients.\u201d Hearing those words, a terror flashed across Lei Ou\u2019s face. He hurriedly shouted angrily at Lei Lei by his side.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes\u2026\u201d The equally extremely frightened Lei Lei hurriedly stood up, crawling and stumbling out of the room.</p><br/><p>Watching Lei Ou who had become extremely obedient in the blink of an eye, Ya Fei smiled bitterly and shook her head. This old fellow was really a\u2026 cheap bastard\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Dou Huang\u2026 god. This Xiao Yan is actually acquainted with such an extremely strong person. No wonder he has the courage to come to the capital\u2026\u201d Ya Fei eyed the well built back in front of her. She increasingly felt that this fellow was more and more difficult to see through.</p><br/><p>Standing up from her seat, Ya Fei respectfully watched Hai Bo Dong as she timidly asked, \u201cIs Old Sir acquainted with our First Elder?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat useless fellow still hasn\u2019t died?\u201d Hai Bo Dong slowly returned to his seat and once again spoke a bold sentence that caused Lei Ou\u2019s body, which was lying on the ground, to twitch.</p><br/><p>This bold words of Hai Bo Dong similarly caused Ya Fei to be a little embarrassed. She softly said, \u201cAll is well with the First Elder. May I ask Old Sir\u2019s name?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you see that useless fellow, just tell him that I, Hai Bo Dong, haven\u2019t died. He will naturally know.\u201d Hai Bo Dong said faintly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Hearing those words, Ya Fei could only respectfully respond. Her hands crossed each other, appearing to be at a loss. The corner of her eyes suddenly drifted to the purple-gold card on the table and hurriedly picked it up, intending to return it to him. According to the rules, a Dou Huang could enjoy such a lavish treatment.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t need to return it. He won\u2019t take it.\u201d Seeing Ya Fei\u2019s action, Xiao Yan smiled and turned his gaze toward Hai Bo Dong and asked, \u201cAm I right, Old Hai?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, this fellow. This little girl isn\u2019t even your lover. Do you need to help her save this bit of money?\u201d Hai Bo Dong skimmed his lips and helplessly said.</p><br/><p>When Hai Bo Dong\u2019s words left his mouth, Ya Fei\u2019s pretty face became slightly red. She held the purple-gold card and hesitated for a moment before calling over a female servant and ordering her to take out some of the money in it. However, before the female servant left, she instructed her to cut the price by half.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, little girl really knows how to conduct herself\u2026\u201d Although Ya Fei\u2019s voice was very soft, it still reached Hai Bo Dong\u2019s ears. At that moment, he smiled and nodded, clearly having a good impression because of this action of hers.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled, turned around and stared at Ya Fei, who had an exquisite, pretty face. He suddenly asked, \u201cThat\u2019s right, can you help me check if there is anything in the auction house which can recover Spiritual Strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRecover Spiritual Strength?\u201d Hearing this Ya Fei was momentarily at a loss. Immediately, she frowned and said, \u201cThose things are definitely unique things\u2026. I will search for you.\u201d As she said that , she turned around and went to a bookshelf. After she searched for a moment, she finally hugged a thick book and walked out. She carefully searched through it before shaking her head and said apologetically, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. The things that can help recover Spiritual Strength are really far too rare. I have searched the records of the auction house for the past year and it seems we didn\u2019t collect any treasures of that kind.\u201d</p><br/><p>Disappointment flashed across his face as Xiao Yan smiled bitterly and nodded. His spirit was somewhat dispirited as he returned to his seat.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s disappointed manner, Ya Fei helplessly shook her head, but did not have the ability to help even though she wanted to.</p><br/><p>Time slowly flowed by. Just as the ten minutes were about to pass, Lei Lei\u2019s panicked shadow finally rushed in from the door. He stumbled and scrambled before he carefully placed a few jade boxes on the table and said in a trembling voice, \u201cSir, the medicinal ingredients that you need are all placed here. None of them are even slightly damaged\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing the jade boxes, a joy appeared on Hai Bo Dong\u2019s face. He carefully opened them and smiled as he handed them over to Xiao Yan and said anxiously, \u201cCheck them and see if they are the right medicinal ingredients.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan received the jade box and carefully observed them. After which, he nodded under the anxious and alarmed gazes of Lei Ou and Lei Lei. \u201cYes, They're fine. The medicinal ingredients are preserved quite well and their ages are sufficient.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026\u201d Hearing Xiao Yan confirmation, Hai Bo Dong let out a long sigh. He turned around and spoke coldly toward Lei Ou, \u201cGet lost. And\u2026 this girl is extremely pleasing to my eye. Go back and tell Primer Tengshan that the first word of the \u2018Acting Supervising Elder\u2019 can be dropped\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the corner of of Lei Ou\u2019s mouth convulsed. He hurriedly nodded and with the support of Lei Lei, left in a humiliated state.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we managed to obtain the things, shall we leave?\u201d After storing the jade box properly, Hai Bo Dong said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He was about to bid Ya Fei goodbye when a female servant strode into the room and said respectfully to Ya Fei, \u201cYa Fei xiao-jie, Nalan xiao-jie wishes to see you regarding something...:\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNalan? Nalan Yanran?\u201d These two words, which were pretty much forbidden words in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart, caused him to be briefly at a loss. Quickly following that, his expression became instantly dark.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

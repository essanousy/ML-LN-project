Since Xiao Yan had begun refining the Purple Flame, half a month had passed.</p><br/><p>During this half a month, Xiao Yan had basically gave up on training his Dou Qi and transferred all of the energy that his body had absorbed from the surroundings into the Purple Flame that was similar to a bottomless pit. As this craziness was prolonged, Xiao Yan\u2019s achievement was also very obvious.</p><br/><p>The Purple Flame, which used to be approximately the size of one\u2019s pinkie, had now been enlarged by ten times. Each time Xiao Yan looked into himself and saw the growing Purple Flame, a satisfied feeling would appear within him. At this pace, he would at the very most need another half a month before the Purple Flame would achieve the requirement necessary for him to evolve his Qi Method.</p><br/><p>It was another day training under the hot sun. Xiao Yan was seated on the rocks. his clothes had already been drenched by his sweat. After enduring the training under the hot sun for around two hours, Xiao Yan finally exited from his training mode when the temperature in the air was slowly declining, He lowered his head, saw his drenched clothes and helplessly shook his head.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stretched his body and then closed his eyes to look inside him. When he observed that the Purple Flame has grown a little again, he gave a satisfied smile, got to his feet and lightly hopped.</p><br/><p>After half a month of being under the sun, Xiao Yan\u2019s skin had turned darker. His delicate and handsome face also appeared a little more mature from his perseverance in training.</p><br/><p>When his slightly numbed legs recovered to their original state, Xiao Yan extended his arm and lightly flicked his finger. Following a soft sound, a huge ball of purple colored flame suddenly rose from Xiao Yan\u2019s palm and instantly covered his entire hand.</p><br/><p>After half a month of tough training, the tiny Purple Flame that erupted from his finger could now cover his entire hand.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan grinned as he watched his hand that was encompassed within the Purple Flame. He slowly tightened his fist and suddenly threw a punch out. Instantly, the high temperature grilled the air in front of him till it became slightly distorted and blurry.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk. If this was hit onto someone\u2019s body, the effect should not be too bad.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and said softly while allowing the Purple Flame on his hand to slowly rise.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan played with the Purple Flame on the mountain rock before he reluctantly kept it in his body. His body shook slightly and the Purple Cloud Wings shot out from his back. He tilted his head and smiled at the black wings that held a glowing purple color, then leaped back down into the valley.</p><br/><p>The intense sound from the wind blew past Xiao Yan ears. When he was around twenty meters from the ground, Xiao Yan\u2019s wings flapped and his quick descent slowed down. He extended his palm, aimed at the ground and unleashed an explosive pushing force.With the force, Xiao Yan\u2019s body was lifted slightly, allowing him to flip in the air. Meanwhile, the Purple Cloud Wings on Xiao Yan\u2019s back transformed back into the tatoos on his back with a shrinking sound.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s legs steadied landed on the ground and his body shook slightly, eliminating all the forces on his body. A moment later, he straightened his body and headed to the small cottage with a smile.</p><br/><p>As he slowly approached the small cottage, Xiao Yan frowned. Normally, the Fairy Doctor would have returned from picking herbs by now. Yet, why was it so quiet today?</p><br/><p>A suspicion flashed in his mind. Xiao Yan gradually arrived at the front of the small cottage and knocked on the wooden door but there was not the slightest sound in it. He knocked again for a few times, obtaining the same result.</p><br/><p>Pressing his eyebrows together, an uneasiness flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s heart. He stood at the door and hesitated for awhile. Finally, he clenched his teeth and violently kicked opened the wooden door.</p><br/><p>After roughly kicking open the door, Xiao Yan hurried in, only to find that the room was filled with smoke, causing him to cough a few times. His right palm was hurriedly extended and a ferocious force was unleashed from his palm, instantly sweeping all of the smoke out of the straw house.</p><br/><p>As the smoke inside slowly dissipated, Xiao Yan saw the Fairy Doctor on the bed with her eyes closed. Her originally red and moist face was now strangely covered with seven different colors.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the Fairy Doctor did not appear to be breathing, Xiao Yan panicked. He was about to hurry over when a light figure suddenly rushed out from the black colored ring in his hand and shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t go over!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s shout shocked Xiao Yan into pausing at the same spot. It was a long while later when he recovered from this deafening scream. He looked at Yao Lao curiously, his face filled with confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to die, you can touch her.\u201d Yao Lao said in a deep voice as he stared at the Fairy Doctor\u2019s seven colored face with a serious face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Yao Lao display such an expression for the first time, Xiao Yan suffered a great shock. His gaze swept across the Fairy Doctor once more as he asked in a perturbed voice.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao did not answer. His floating body circled the unconscious Fairy Doctor for a few times. A moment later, he shook his head and sighed softly, \u201cIt really is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Yao Lao\u2019s downcast face, Xiao Yan\u2019s heart tightened. He carefully asked, \u201cWhat exactly is wrong with her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at her hand.\u201d Yao Lao pointed at the opened jade bottle in the Fairy Doctor\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan hurriedly moved his gaze towards the Fairy Doctor\u2019s hand. On it, he saw that she was holding a small bag of black medicinal powder. Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes blinked doubtfully. He stepped forward, stopped a few feet from the Fairy Doctor\u2019s hand and lightly sniffed the smell unleashed by the medicinal powder. Instantly, his head felt giddy and his chest felt like everything was being overturned. He felt weak and was forced to sit on the ground while gagging for a long while. Finally, he stood up and said in a stunned voice, \u201cWhat a powerful poison. That thing should even be able to kill a Dou Shi if they are not careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, even I have to admit that this little girl is extremely gifted in making poison.\u201d Yao Lao nodded with a smile. His voice containing a praise or some other feeling.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled bitterly and nodded. He also felt that the Fairy Doctor was a natural expert poison manipulator. Maybe calling her a Poison Fairy was more accurate.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at the corner of her mouth.\u201d Yao Lao pointed out as he floated in the cottage.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze moved from the Fairy Doctor\u2019s hand to her red lips that was dripping with beauty. His eyes narrowed. Beside the red moistness, there were remnants of the black powder. From its color and scent, it was obviously the black colored poison the Fairy Doctor held in her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe took the poison and committed suicide? How is that possible? For no reason, why did she kill herself?\u201d Staring stupidly at the black remnants, Xiao Yan muttered in a perplexed manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said that she committed suicide? Have you seen any dead person who looks so beautiful?\u201d Yao Lao rolled his eyes and curled his lips as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer strength is only that of a one star Dou Zhe, how can she withstand something that could even kill a Dou Shi?\u201d Xiao Yan wanted to pounce forward and check for the Fairy Doctor\u2019s breathing but after Yao Lao\u2019s yell from before, he could only pace around anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf she was an ordinary person, she would certainly die. But\u2026\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s eyes stared at the beautiful sleeping posture of the Fairy Doctor on the bed and softly said, \u201cBut she won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Xiao Yan paused his footsteps and asked in a stunned voice. \u201cWhere is she different? Is it because of her identity as a poison master? But even if it was a poison master, being poisoned to death by their own poison is not something unusual. It is not as though they are invulnerable to poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCorrect. Even highly skilled poison masters have the possibility of being killed by their poisons.\u201d Yao Lao nodded and said in a grave voice, \u201cBut there are always exceptions. In the Dou Qi continent, there is a kind of special physique. This kind of physique is given the name\u2026 \u2018Natural Poison Body\u2019 or \u2018Woeful Poison Body\u2019 as the appearance of such a poison body would usually bring woe to others.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNatural Poison Body? Woeful Poison Body?\u201d The foreign names held no significance in Xiao Yan\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have stayed in Wu Tan City for most of your life and it is only natural that you are unaware of some of the secrets of the Dou Qi continent. Back when I still had my physical body, a woman with the Woeful Poison Body appeared on the Dou Qi continent. In a moment of anger, this woman poisoned the grounds of an entire empire. On the poisoned grounds, hundreds of thousands died.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Hearing those words, Xiao Yan quickly inhaled cold air. Was that woman not overly vicious? Hundreds of thousands of lives were just mercilessly taken? Was she simply killing chickens?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should know that there are laws amongst the strong in the Dou Qi continent. The woman\u2019s actions were undoubtedly breaking these unofficial rules. After all, there were many strong people who originated from that empire\u2026 thus, the situation was erupted from this. One by one, many strong people went to find that woman to seek revenge but each of them in turn were defeated. Oh yes, amongst those strong people, the weakest was at least a Dou Ling and the strongest was a nine star Dou Huang who was about to step into the Dou Zong stage.\u201d As Yao Lao recounted, he suddenly waved his hand. \u201cUnfortunately, they were all killed in the woman\u2019s hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGulp\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan swallowed his saliva with difficulty as he wiped the cold perspiration off his face. Wasn\u2019t that woman too strong? She really killed people like killing chickens and dogs.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the end of the entire mess, a couple of the old farts were pulled into the mess. After an intense fight that outsiders were unaware of, this woman who was a mere five star Dou Huang escaped after being injured while among the old farts, a Dou Zong level Practitioner took ten years to expel the poison before he managed to fully recover.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIncredible\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s throat rolled for a moment. With just the strength of a Dou Huang, she dared to confront a Dou Zong and actually managed to leave behind a severe wound? With regards to this type of person, Xiao Yan could only use the word \u201cIncredible\u201d to describe them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter this woman fled afar for twenty years, she once again appeared. By that time, she had already been promoted to the Dou Zong class. At this time, those old fools which had secretly suffered in her hands did not dare come out and randomly judge her. Thus they could only pretend to be deaf and ignored all news about her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTwenty years\u2026 Rising from a five star Dou Huang to a Dou Zong. This speed can be considered to be abnormal.\u201d Xiao Yan said as he shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 this woman does indeed possess that kind of frightening talent.\u201d Yao Lao nodded his head as he shifted his gaze to the Fairy Doctor on the bed and softly said, \u201cAfter that, I bumped into that woman once when I found a Spiritual Herb and a conflict started. Finally... we ended up fighting.\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes gradually widened. This was the first time he heard Yao Lao leak some of the his old deeds. Immediately, he hurriedly asked, \u201cWhat was the result?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe result\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao smiled and raised his head. His muddy eyes appeared to sigh over the memories. A long while later, he gave a faint smile and said, \u201cThe result can be considered that I beat her by a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan took in a deep breath. His face was filled with shock.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It caused the region to appear hazy and mysterious.</p><br/><p>Other than some Magical Beasts searching for food within the mountains deep in the night, most of them had returned home to sleep. The entire forest had descended into silence at this moment. It was a long time before a low roar was slowly transmitted from far away before finally spreading and gradually disappearing.</p><br/><p>A black figure suddenly and quietly flew through the pitch black night. A pair of enormous wings flapped slightly, lifting a tiny air flow. The figure\u2019s body borrowed the tiny air flow as it flashed across the night sky, passing through without disturbing anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu!\u201d</p><br/><p>A human figure suddenly appeared out of nowhere on top of a tree outside of the valley. His gaze was shining as he eyed the interior of the dark-black mountain alley. Due to the ferocious battle during the day, the entrance to the mountain valley was a total mess. Large and small craters spread out in a chaotic manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed softly as he eyed the deep mountain valley. He waved his sleeve gently and a seven-colored shadow immediately shot out from his sleeves. Finally, it joyfully and repeatedly revolved around Xiao Yan\u2019s body. Hissing sounds were emitted from its mouth unceasingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a greedy fellow.\u201d Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head when he saw the eyes of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 staring intently at his storage ring. With a shake of his hand, a bottle of \u2018Amethyst Lion Birth Essence\u2019 appeared in his hand.</p><br/><p>5egyrfThe \u2018Amethyst Lion Birth Essence\u2019 had just appeared when the body of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 swiftly charged over in a lightning-like manner. It took advantage of Xiao Yan\u2019s unprepared state to entangle its long body with both Xiao Yan\u2019s hand and the bottle. It extended its snake\u2019s tongue and probed it deep into the bottle before sucking viciously. The \u2018Amethyst Lion Birth Essence\u2019 within the jade bottle was reduced by nearly one-third with that one action.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s palm pulled the head of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 away before he hurriedly snatched back the jade bottle. When he saw that there was only around two-thirds of the quantity within it, he involuntarily smacked his mouth in his heartache. The appetite of this greedy fellow was growing increasingly larger. In the past, a few drops would satisfy it. Now, it actually wanted to drink this much. If it continued with this kind of appetite, the few bottles of the \u2018Amethyst Essence\u2019 that remained would be insufficient for it to eat.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 let out its snake tongue in satisfaction after viciously drinking a few mouthfuls of \u2018Amethyst Essence.\u2019 It wiggled its long body and coiled around Xiao Yan\u2019s arm. Under the moonlight, the seven-colored python reflected a brilliant luster and appeared extremely beautiful.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan turned his head slightly after storing the \u2018Amethyst Essence.\u2019 His eyes coincidentally came into eye contact with those snake eyes which contained a faint seven colors. Immediately, a feeling surged up within his heart: bewitching. It was the same feeling he had when he saw Queen Medusa for the first time.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s throat rolled as he swallowed his saliva. The current \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 appeared to have an increasing number of similarities to that of Queen Medusa. This\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed bitterly and sighed. His hand gently rubbed the small head of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python.\u2019 The latter docilely narrowed its bewitching snake eyes. Its snake\u2019s tongue was extended toward his palm. That squishy feeling caused Xiao Yan to feel itchy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fellow, you must endure. Do not let that woman swallow your soul. Otherwise, I\u2019m afraid that the both of us will not have good endings.\u201d Xiao Yan sighed and shook his head. Whenever he recalled Queen Medusa, who was a mixture of bewitchment and killer\u2019s rage, he would have a headache. Of course, anyone who had such a complicated dispute with an extremely strong Dou Zong would likely not be too happy. This was especially the case when this extremely strong person was the type who viewed human lives as trash. Killing a person was basically easier than killing a chicken to her. She did not feel the slightest burden when killing a person.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 emitted a wave of hissing sounds, appearing to have understood Xiao Yan\u2019s words. There was a luster flickering within those bewitching snake\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, these are all problems in the future. Now that you have eaten until you are full, you must do some work for me. If you dare be lazy, you can forget about eating the \u2018Amethyst Essence\u2019 in the future.\u201d Xiao Yan patted the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 as he threw away the thoughts in his heart as he spoke with a laugh.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s threat clearly possessed a great effect toward the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python.\u2019 This little fellow hurriedly nodded its head. It shook its tail and its body turned into a seven-colored glow that flashed in front of Xiao Yan. Its speed caused Xiao Yan to be only able to see a few light rays shuttling passed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shook his head and slowly flapped the Purple Cloud Wings on his back. His body gradually rose into the air and quietly flew toward the mountain valley. The \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 was circling around his body, protecting him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s flying speed was extremely slow. The entire entrance to the mountain valley did not have the slightest sound. The complete silence was such that it was frightening.</p><br/><p>However, just as Xiao Yan was merely around a couple of dozens of meters from the valley\u2019s entrance, the scales of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python,\u2019 that was drifting around him, suddenly became vertical. A somewhat sharp hissing sound was emitted from its mouth, and it reverberated throughout this entrance of the mountain valley.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart was shocked when he saw this action of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python.\u2019 He hurriedly came to a stop. Dou Qi swiftly flowed within his body as his gaze stared intently at the deep mountain valley.</p><br/><p>Following the flow of time, a pair of bright red lights gradually appeared from within the dark-black mountain valley. Soon after, the glow gradually became bigger before the pair of bright red glowing spots turned into a pair of huge red-colored eyes. The low sound of footsteps could be heard under the faint moonlight.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan quietly sighed in relief when he saw the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape\u2019 that appeared under the moonlight. The fur of the latter had currently turned back into a snow-white color. Moreover, the Qi that the surface of its body emitted was also much weaker compared to the daytime. Clearly, the weakened feeling after awaking its bloodline caused it to have difficulty reaching its peak condition.</p><br/><p>A pair of bright-red, large eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan in mid-air. Perhaps it should be\u2026 the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 beside Xiao Yan\u2026 Since they were both Magical Beasts, the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape\u2019 was not unfamiliar with the aura emitted from the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python.\u2019 The Qi from the snake caused it to feel uneasy as well as a little fearful.</p><br/><p>The serpent and the ape looked at each other under the moonlight. Two powerful Qis gradually rose. Under the pressure of these two forces, Xiao Yan, given his current strength, actually felt asphyxia.</p><br/><p>An invisible Spiritual Strength rose out from the dark black ring on his finger, wrapping Xiao Yan within it. It also isolated the pressuring force of both the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 and the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape.\u2019 Yao Lao\u2019s voice sounded within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart, \u201cLet the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 block the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape.\u2019 You should seize the time and enter the mountain valley to search for the \u2018Core Quenching Body Milk.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAi.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded his head slightly. He turned toward the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 by his side and cried out softly, \u201cLittle fellow, block it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss!\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 emitted a wave of hissing sound when it heard Xiao Yan\u2019s orders. A faint seven-colored glow suddenly surged out from its body. Following the appearance of the strong seven-colored light, the former\u2019s body swelled swiftly and abruptly at a pace visible to the naked eye.</p><br/><p>In merely the blink of an eye, the originally mini pocket-sized \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 had transformed into a large being that was over a hundred feet long. The \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 swung its enormous body under the night sky. A pair of bewitching snake eyes stared at the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape\u2019 below. Even the sky began to fluctuate slightly as its snake\u2019s tongue extended and shrunk back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little fellow\u2019s strength has once again soared greatly after sleeping for so long. It is indeed worthy of the name \u2018Heaven Swallowing.\u2019 If it were to reach its peak, it will likely really possess the strength to destroy the land and sky.\u201d Xiao Yan involuntarily exclaimed as he sensed the body of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 which was even larger than the last time he saw it back at the Misty Cloud Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018The Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 is a kind of unique beast from ancient times. Under normal circumstances, it would require a hundred years if it wanted to reach this kind of stage. If not for the repeated erosion and merger by the spirit of Queen Medusa, this beast of yours would not be able to evolve this swiftly. Rather than saying that it is becoming stronger, you might as well say that it is taking advantage of Queen Medusa\u2019s strength.\u201d Yao Lao said faintly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded quietly. It was Queen Medusa once again. This woman was really a little too terrifying...</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out a long sigh. He paused for over ten seconds before suddenly flapping the wings on his back. His body turned into a black shadow that shot explosively toward the mountain valley.</p><br/><p>That \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape\u2019 appeared to have sensed something when Xiao Yan moved. It immediately emitted a furious roar as its feet stomped on the ground. Its large body was like a cannonball as it shot toward Xiao Yan to block him. A sharp ear-piercing sound rang out from the valley\u2019s entrance.</p><br/><p>While the speed of the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape\u2019 was extremely fast, the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 was even faster. Before the former could reach Xiao Yan, it saw a seven-colored intense glow in front of it. An enormous tail that carried a rich seven-colored glow violently fell from the sky before finally heavily smashing into the body of the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape.\u2019 An enormous strength immediately erupted as it smashed the ape toward the mountain wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>A large piece of the hard mountain wall fell behind the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape.\u2019 As the enormous piece fell, numerous crack lines began to spread out behind it like spider web. Finally, these crack lines spread over half of the mountain wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape\u2019 became furious when it received such a heavy blow. The bright redness rapidly increased within its eyes. It ignored the tiny thread of fear it felt for the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 within its heart as icy-cold energy ripples agglomerated on the surface of its body. Following the agglomeration of energy, the icy-cold energy even caused the air around it to freeze. It opened its large mouth and bared its fangs. Cold air agglomerated suddenly and instantly turned into an enormous icy-cold swirling ball that was at least five feet large.</p><br/><p>As the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape\u2019 pounded its claws on its chest, the swirling ball that contained a frighteningly cold energy suddenly shot out. Its target was the \u2018Seven-Colored Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 in the sky. As the ball moved, a long, white-colored trace was faintly left behind in the empty air.</p><br/><p>The bewitching snake eyes of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 in the sky watched the swirling ball that shot over explosively. A moment later, a strong seven-colored glow erupted. It was like a seven-colored dazzling sun in the night sky that collided heavily with the icy-cold swirling ball. Immediately, an enormous energy explosion sounded within the mountain range like a thunderclap.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His gaze eyed the creamy-white liquid within the notch. Although this had already been diluted, its effect was still quite good. Even if it could not achieve the effect of washing and refining the bones, it also had quite a great refining effect on the body.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can also collect some of this. Perhaps, you might be able to use it when you refine pills in the future.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s voice sounded above Xiao Yan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded when he heard this. He took out two jade bottles from within his storage ring and carefully filled them with the cream-colored \u2018Core Quenching Body Milk.\u2019 After filling the two jade bottles, there was nearly less than half of the cream liquid remaining in the notch.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan glanced at the remaining liquid. He mused for a while, but did not completely take it all away. Lin Xiu Ya and the others might well come and take this \u2018Core Quenching Body Milk\u2019 in the future. If they returned empty-handed after toiling for half a day, they would undoubtedly have some doubts about someone else taking the thing away. Moreover, only the few of them and himself knew that there was a unique treasure in this place. Although Xiao Yan was not afraid of their suspicions, this \u2018Core Quenching Body Milk\u2019 was ultimately something that Han Yue had discovered no matter how one put it. Xiao Yan had gained a great bargain for no reason. It would indeed be somewhat overboard for him to be greedy and take everything away.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stored the two bottles of diluted \u2018Core Quenching Body Milk\u2019 into his storage ring as these thoughts circulated in his heart. After which, he no longer paused as he turned his body and swiftly flew along the path which he had taken. Since he had already familiarized himself with the path before, Xiao Yan had reduced quite a lot of time when he exited this time around. In merely less than twenty minutes, he exited the mountain cave.</p><br/><p>With a flap of his wings, Xiao Yan flew toward the exit of the valley. His gaze eyed the area a distance away. He was still able to see the vaguely visible seven-colored glow and the thunder-like energy explosions within the dark night.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan only sighed in relief when he saw that the seven-colored glow was still bright. He swiftly flapped his wings and his body transformed into a black shadow which shuttled through the dark night without any noise. Some time later, his body paused as it appeared in the air above the mountain valley. His gaze glanced at the battleground outside, and he could not help but be a little speechless.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the entrance to the valley had been damaged until it appeared completely different. The originally flat ground was covered by enormous craters while enormous rocks that fell from the mountain wall were spread all over the place. The forest on both sides were also wrecked; trees laid horizontally and even covered half of the path into the valley.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 was still curled up as it lingered in the air within this battleground. Seven-colored glows surged out of its body unceasingly. The powerful suppression caused all the Magical Beasts hidden in a five kilometer radius to shiver. Although the Qi of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 was still powerful, one was still able to see some deep claw scars on the seven-colored snake\u2019s scales if one were to look carefully. Clearly, the former was not in an undefeatable position in its fight with the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape.\u2019</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze drifted down. When he eyed the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape\u2019 on the ground, a stunned look involuntarily flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s face. At this moment, over half of the snow white fur on the beast was corroded by the snake\u2019s saliva with its strong acidic properties. Fresh blood flowed on its enormous head, causing the originally terrible looking head to appear even more savage. Scars from being struck by powerful energy could be seen everywhere on its body. Some fear and weariness appeared within those originally large, lantern-like bright-red eyes. Clearly, the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape,\u2019 which was already in a weakened state, had already completely lost its fighting spirit when faced with a strong opponent like the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019.</p><br/><p>Compared to the miserable appearance of the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape,\u2019 the little injuries on the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 appeared to be insignificant.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really unexpected that this little fellow is actually this strong. It is really worthy of being a unique beast from ancient times.\u201d Xiao Yan eyed the difference in the injuries of both parties and involuntarily muttered in surprise within his heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s appearance similarly attracted the attention of both the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 and the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape.\u2019 The former extended its snake\u2019s tongue somewhat excitedly at Xiao Yan. On the other hand, the latter emitted a furious roar somewhat restlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fellow, go!\u201d Xiao Yan ignored the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape\u2019 which was roaring while facing the sky. He cried out to the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 before immediately flapping his wings. His body flew swiftly in the direction of the deep mountains.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 hesitated a little behind him before swinging its enormous tail. The seven-colored glow which intensified around its body swiftly shrunk. After which, it transformed into a tiny light shadow that swiftly rushed toward Xiao Yan. Finally, the two figures gradually disappeared in the black night, leaving behind the furious but helpless \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape\u2019 who was in a frenzied state.</p><br/><p>A large and small figure suddenly descended from the sky within the dark night. Finally, they landed on a mountain peak. Xiao Yan turned around and eyed the mountain valley which had already disappeared from the edge of his sight. Only then did he sigh in relief.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan turned his head over and eyed the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 suspended in front of him. At this moment, the glow of the seven-colored scales had quietly become dimmer. From the looks of it, its exhaustion from the intense fight with the \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape\u2019 earlier was very great. Xiao Yan\u2019s hand gently rubbed the small head of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python.\u2019 He took out a bottle of \u2018Amethyst Essence\u2019 from his storage ring and smiled as he said, \u201cCome, little fellow. You have done well tonight. This time around, I will let you eat until you are full.</p><br/><p>If it was in the past, it was likely that the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 would immediately pounce over when it saw Xiao Yan take out the \u2018Amethyst Essence.\u2019 However, the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 strangely stopped in air without moving. A pair of bewitching snake eyes glanced at Xiao Yan. Just as a feeling of something being wrong appeared in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart, an icy-cold voice was suddenly emitted from the mouth of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python,\u2019 \u201cYou are actually really treating me as a pet to rear?\u201d The voice may have been ice-cold, but it contained a numb feeling that caused a nefarious flame to rise in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Just as the nefarious flame rose within Xiao Yan\u2019s lower abdomen, he suddenly felt a coldness seeping out from his heart. His eyes suddenly stared at the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 in front of him, and he was stunned for an instant. His body hurriedly withdrew in a lightning-like matter as he uttered in shock, \u201cQueen Medusa?\u201d</p><br/><p>During the time that Xiao Yan was rushing back, the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 once again emitted a faint seven-colored glow. Its body also gradually moved. An instant later, it transformed into an enchanting and alluring being that could basically cause a man to instantly turn into a beast.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan clearly knew in his heart that this was a beautiful human snake that could eat people in front of him, he was still unable to help but feel a little distracted. However, this distracted feeling immediately disappeared when a pair of cold ice-like pupils glanced over, leaving behind only his guard and caution.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze finally stopped on the ice-cold bewitching face, which one could not find any flaws. He laughed dryly, only to realize that his voice had turned somewhat hoarse.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, what a coincidence. We meet again.\u201d The extremely stupid greeting was sufficient to show just what degree of anxiety Xiao Yan felt within his heart. The fear he had for this woman in front of him was even stronger than what he felt for Yun Shan from the Misty Cloud Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a coincidence. However, I must thank you for that. If you did not let the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 fight with \u2018Snow Demon Sky Ape\u2019 and exhaust a great amount of energy in the process, I would still be suppressed by it.\u201d Queen Medusa glanced at Xiao Yan. The corner of her sleek, red mouth was lifted into a mocking manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan parted his mouth and could not resist thinking of giving himself a slap. It was unexpected that the culprit was himself\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you gathered all the medicinal ingredients to refine the \u2018Thawing Spirit Spill?\u2019\u201d Queen Medusa ignored Xiao Yan\u2019s ugly expression as she asked in an indifferent manner.</p><br/><p>The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes twitched as he laughed bitterly in his heart. What gather them all? He had never put this matter in his heart. Just settling his own things had already made him terribly busy. Where did he get the time to help her search for the medicinal ingredients for the \u2018Thawing Spirit Pill?\u2019 Moreover, even if he did have the time, he would definitely delay it as long as he can. Otherwise, once this woman obtained the \u2018Thawing Spirit Pill\u2019 and merged her spirit with that of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python,\u2019 the first person to be unlucky was likely himself. This damn woman had never hidden her killing intent for him from the start.</p><br/><p>However, he did understand her after thinking a little. With Queen Medusa\u2019s noble identity and her haughty character, how would she be able to endure being turned into a pet and fighter that Xiao Yan was currently rearing? If it were not because of the \u2018Thawing Spirit Pill\u2019 and the repeated rebound of the spirit of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python,\u2019 it was likely that she would have long since used a few slaps to tear Xiao Yan apart.</p><br/><p>A cold smile and killing intent gradually surfaced on Queen Medusa\u2019s face when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s silent and speechless manner. \u201cLooks like you did not put this matter in your heart. Since this is the case, what is the use of leaving you around?\u201d</p><br/><p>Queen Medusa suddenly waved her delicate hand when she said this. Following the waving of her hand, Xiao Yan was shocked to realize that the surrounding space had solidified at this moment. His body was locked within it, and he was unable to move.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the true strength of an elite Dou Zong? They can actually solidify space by just raising their hands?\u201d Shock flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s heart. His knowledge of the strength of an elite Dou Zong became much deeper.</p><br/><p>Queen Medusa coldly eyed Xiao Yan as he struggled with all his strength. She moved her feet, one after the other, and slowly walked toward Xiao Yan. She lifted her hand vertically and a faint seven-colored glow gathered on her palm. Finally, it agglomerated into a sharp seven-colored longsword.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan used all his strength to struggle, but the surrounding space did not move even a little. Just as he was about to helplessly give up, a familiar, powerful Spiritual ripple finally swarmed out from the black-colored ring on his hand. Under the undulation of this Spiritual ripple, the surrounding cage-like solidified space suddenly shattered. Xiao Yan\u2019s body obtained freedom at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, being able to solidify space after just advancing to the Dou Zong class. You are really worthy of being Queen Medusa. However, who are you to just kill the disciple of Yao Chen just because you want to?\u201d An old laugh slowly sounded. Yao Lao\u2019s illusionary body rose out from the dark-black ring. Finally, he was suspended beside Xiao Yan as he indifferently watched Queen Medusa on the opposite side.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They immediately saw a large group of human figures rushing over before finally remaining suspended all over the sky.</p><br/><p>The sudden appearance of a large number of people caused some commotion in the open ground. This was because they realized that everyone in the sky had a pair of Dou Qi wings on their backs. In this way, all of these people were at least experts of the Dou Wang class!</p><br/><p>Quite a number of people quietly inhaled a breath of cool air when they thought of this. There were at the very least a couple dozen human figures in the sky. It was likely that even the Misty Cloud Sect would not be able to attract so many expert Dou Wangs with its strength.</p><br/><p>On the wedding stage, Yun Shan\u2019s expression slowly turned gloomy after hearing the laugh. He raised his head and his gaze appeared to see through the air as he looked at the black-robed, young man flapping his jade-green fire wings in the sky. His dark, cold voice resounded over the entire place.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, the dog that lost its home back then dares to say such lacking words. Xiao Yan, the old me could expelled you like a dog and forced you to flee three years ago. The ending will still be the same three years later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shan coldly laughed. Numerous surprised private conversations immediately sounded in the open ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person is Xiao Yan? The Xiao Yan who was wanted and chased by the Misty Cloud Sect back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, who else would it be other than him? He has a blood feud with the Misty Cloud Sect. Back then, he was chased out of the empire. It is really unexpected that this fellow has returned three years later. Not only has his strength soared greatly but he has also brought back quite a number of experts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is rumored that the experts whom the Misty Cloud Sect had sent to eliminate the Primer clan were all killed by Xiao Yan\u2019s hands. If this is true, isn\u2019t this fellow a little too frightening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like the Misty Cloud Sect will experience quite the trouble today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, that is not be certain. The Misty Cloud Sect has Yun Shan, this elite Dou Zong. It is likely that Xiao Yan\u2019s chances of victory will not be high if they were to really fight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also heard some of the private conversations below. He smiled as his gaze swept toward Yun Shan. Those eyes of his involuntarily turned dense and cold, \u201cOld dog Yun Shan, you have destroyed my Xiao clan. If you don\u2019t hand over your dog head, it is likely that it will be difficult to wash away this blood feud!\u201d</p><br/><p>During the many years in which Yun Shan had been the sect leader of the Misty Cloud Sect, only Xiao Yan alone dared to call him an old dog in front of so many people. Hence, despite his somber character, Yun Shan\u2019s face could not help but appear a little uglier at this moment.</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s gaze slowly swept over the large number of human figures in the sky while his expression was ugly. A moment later, he stared at the faces of Jia Xingtian and the others and immediately let out a cold laughter, \u201cWhy? Jia Xingtian, Fa Ma, are all of you also going to stand by the side of this little fellow who doesn\u2019t know the immensity of the Heavens and Earth?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Shan, don\u2019t think that we are unaware of what kind of wild ambition your Misty Cloud Sect has possessed during these few years. Do you really think it is so easy to get us to sit back and do nothing?\u201d Since they had already reached this step, Jia Xingtian was naturally unafraid of Yun Shan. Hence, the ridicule in his words was extremely dense.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, alright, alright, very good!\u201d Yun Shan immediately laughed to the sky after hearing Jia Xingtian\u2019s words. \u201cIt is really unexpected that all of you would have such courage after the return of this little brat, who was forced out of the empire by me back then. Very good. Since all of you are here, there is no longer for any of you to leave today!\u201d</p><br/><p>The enormous Misty Cloud Mountain suddenly emitted a whistle after the loud laughter of Yun Shan sounded. Numerous powerful auras erupted from within the sect. Human figures immediately flashed to the sky. The many Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s Elders who had been awaiting orders had all revealed themselves at this moment.</p><br/><p>An uproar once again erupted on the open ground when everyone saw the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s Elders flashing and appearing. From the looks of the situation, it seemed that a big battle today was unavoidable.</p><br/><p>Under the wedding stage, Gu He\u2019s expression turned quite ugly after Xiao Yan and the others appeared. This was especially when he discovered that the lady, who was covered in a red dress beside him, suddenly trembled when Xiao Yan\u2019s voice sounded. An unknown fury involuntarily surged within his heart. Why? Why do you care so much about this little fellow?</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, today is my wedding day. Aren\u2019t you a little too arrogant in leading people to come and cause trouble in the Misty Cloud Sect?\u201d Gu He inhaled a deep breath of air before he suddenly raised his head and cried out in a stern voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan glanced at Gu He indifferently. His gaze, however, involuntarily paused on the lady beside him whose face was covered by a red cloth. That somewhat familiar graceful figure caused his calm heart to tremble a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Misty Cloud Sect has destroyed my Xiao clan, is that not being arrogant? The Misty Cloud Sect forcefully tried to eliminate the Primer clan, is that not being arrogant? Since the Misty Cloud Sect dares to be so arrogant, why would I, Xiao Yan, not dare to be? The Misty Cloud Sect and I have a blood feud that will not rest until one party dies. Today, I have come only to end this grudge!\u2019 Xiao Yan\u2019s icy-cold gaze shot toward Gu He. His voice also contained cold laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaking revenge is false. I\u2019m afraid ruining the wedding is the true aim, no?\u201d Gu He returned a cold laugh by giving tit for tat.</p><br/><p>\u201cWedding? The bride is but a puppet who is being controlled by someone. Is there any meaning to such a wedding?\u201d Xiao Yan laughed. He suddenly flicked his finger and a wisp of dark-green flame rushed down in a lightning-like manner. It appeared in front of the bride, whose body was wrapped in a red dress, in merely an instant. A faint black glow suddenly surged out of the latter just as the flame was about to strike her, colliding heavily with the flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the two made contact, a muffled sound and spreading wind appeared, and the bride, who was the first to be struck, quickly took two steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Yun!\u201d Gu He immediately became anxious when he saw the bride step back. He was about to extend his head when a somewhat trembling cool voice was emitted under the red cloth, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the open ground exchanged glances with one another after hearing the bride speak for the first time ever since she had appeared. They had also felt something was wrong earlier.</p><br/><p>A pair of jade-like delicate hands were extended out from under the sleeves in front of a countless number of gazes and they immediately pulled aside the red cloth on her head. When the red cloth was pulled off, a beautiful, fair snow-like face appeared in front of everyone\u2019s eyes. That familiar appearance was Yun Yun.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun\u2019s bright eyes were lowered after the red cloth was pulled off. Her gaze shifted but ultimately did not look to the sky. While her head was lowered, a familiar and unforgettable voice in the sky once again carried a cold laugh as it sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Shan, you actually used such despicable means in order to recruit strong people to your side. You really are a \u2018kind teacher\u2019...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, you were allowed to luckily flee. This time around, I will pull all of your teeth out one at a time after capturing you!\u201d Yun Shan\u2019s face twitched after hearing the ridicule in Xiao Yan\u2019s words. A fierce glow flashed across his eyes. His voice had also become indifferent.</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Leader, today\u2019s matter is greatly related to me. Leave this person to me!\u201d Gu He by the side slowly spoke with a gloomy expression after hearing Yun Shan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Yun Shan raised his eyebrows and fondled his beard with his hand when he heard this. He appeared to be in a deep thought as he said, \u201cGu He, your speciality is not in combat. You need not stoop to his level. It will be the same once I capture this little fellow and hand him over to you to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu He shook his head. His gaze glanced toward Yun Yun by the side who had tightened her delicate hand. He inhaled a deep breath before speaking, \u201cI want to let her know that only I am worthy of being with her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shan knit his brows slightly when he saw Gu He\u2019s persistence. Only then did he grudgingly nod his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, regardless of who you are after today, it is the truth that you have disrupted my wedding. If you leave now, I can treat it as though nothing has happened. If you still insist on causing trouble, I will also tell you that, I, Gu He, am not a softy whom others can bully as they please!\u201d Gu He finally raised his head and spoke in a stern voice to Xiao Yan in the sky after seeing Yun Shan nod his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cGu He\u2026 you\u2026\u201d Yun Yun raised her head by the side and spoke anxiously after hearing Gu He\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Yun, shut up!\u201d Yun Shan by the side reprimanded with a cold face when Yun Yun\u2019s voice had just sounded.</p><br/><p>Jia Xingtian and the others involuntarily frowned after seeing that Gu He had really stepped forward after being unable to tolerate the situation. The open ground today did not lack experts who possessed a deep relationship with Gu He. If Gu He were to really intervene, these people would naturally not sit by the side and watch. In that case, the strength of the Misty Cloud Sect would undoubtedly become much stronger.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved his hand at Jia Xingtian and the others, indicating that they need not be worried. He glanced at Gu He before speaking in a solemn manner, \u201cToday\u2019s matter is a grudge between my Xiao clan and the Misty Cloud Sect. Xiao Yan will view anyone obstructing me as an enemy. Even you, Gu He, is no exception!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, alright!\u201d Gu He let out a wave of cold laughter after hearing the words of Xiao Yan. His shoulders shook and a pair of purple-colored fire wings appeared on his back. The fire wings were flapped and his body gradually floated into the air. Finally, he stood opposing Xiao Yan and coldly laughed, \u201cSince this is the case, let\u2019s attack. I also want to see just how strong you, the most outstanding member of the younger generation in the Jia Ma Empire, really are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are not defeated within ten exchanges, Xiao Yan will immediately turn around and leave. However, if you are unable to endure ten exchanges, please do not intervene in the matters between the Misty Cloud Sect and me!\u201d Xiao Yan glanced at Gu He. He smiled and said some shocking words.</p><br/><p>The open ground below immediately started an uproar the moment Xiao Yan\u2019s words sounded. During these three years, Gu He had advanced to the Dou Huang class. Other than Yun Shan, it was likely that no one else had the qualification or the ability to defeat him within ten exchanges. However, at this moment, this young man who appeared to be only around twenty years old actually dared to say such improper words. Although many people knew that Xiao Yan was quite strong, they could not resist shaking their heads. This fellow was really too arrogant\u2026</p><br/><p>Yun Yun was also startled by Xiao Yan\u2019s words. Her delicate hand could not resist tightening. Why was this fellow still so reckless despite having not seen him for three years?</p><br/><p>Gu He in the sky ended up laughing from extreme anger when he heard these arrogant words from Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I, Gu He, shall fight with you and receive your ten moves! I want to see just what qualification you have to actually dare to be this arrogant!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

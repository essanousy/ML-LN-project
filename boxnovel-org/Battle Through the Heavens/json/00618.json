Under this high temperature, Xiao Yan gradually became boiling hot, resulting in a searing pain despite having the protection of the strange fluorescent light and his \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. This essence of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 may not be large, but it took shape only after accumulating for a countless number of years. Therefore, its temperature was extraordinary.</p><br/><p>Despite the searing pain once again appearing within his body, it was not to an extent where it was impossible to endure after Xiao Yan had experienced the intense pain which was worse than death the last time. He forcefully stabilized his mind. Surging green flames flowed out from his body and immediately formed a dragnet shape before surrounding the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019, which was causing destruction within Xiao Yan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 clearly still possessed its own awareness despite having been absorbed into Xiao Yan\u2019s body. Hence, it was crafty as it wiggled in all directions after being surrounded by Xiao Yan. The frightening high temperature no longer caused Xiao Yan to feel pain to the point where he no longer wanted to live. However, it was unavoidable that it would cause a frustration to form in a person\u2019s heart if this was prolonged.</p><br/><p>The capturing continued for nearly ten minutes before Xiao Yan finally ceased this pointless action. Dragging things out in this manner was useless\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe that I cannot capture you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mind slowly became quiet. Threads of dense fluorescent light suddenly seeped out from all over his body before spreading to every single corner of it.</p><br/><p>Being shined upon by the fluorescent light, the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame,\u2019 which was moving in a strange manner, finally became slightly slow. Xiao Yan grabbed this opportunity and used the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 to wrap around it.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 did not give up despite being surrounding by the green flame. Instead, it began to struggle intensely, like an imprisoned beast. It repeatedly emitted a frightening temperature. Under that increasingly intense temperature, Xiao Yan\u2019s originally calm face slowly revealed some pain.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan forcefully endured the searing pain. His mind moved, and the green flame whistled within his body. Finally, it swiftly moved and formed a bright green fireball. The interior of the fireball was the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 which was struggling with all its strength in an attempt to escape.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mind passed through the flame and carried a sternness as he watched the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 within it. His mind turned and the flame rolled. Immediately, waves of green flame came spreading out before finally becoming like numerous tunnels that were inserted into the palm-sized cream-white \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019.</p><br/><p>Following the pouring in of the green flame, that cluster of \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 began to feel threatened. It immediately rolled intensely. However, due to the various interceptions from the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019, it was difficult for it to escape this dragnet-like lock no matter how it leaped and struggled.</p><br/><p>At this moment the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 already possessed its own will. Hence, Xiao Yan needed to remove its will if he wanted to swallow and refine it. Otherwise, swallowing it forcefully would only incur the resistance between the two kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. If they were to erupt at that time, the one who would be the most unlucky would be him. This action of Xiao Yan was controlling the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 to completely removing the will of the other flame!</p><br/><p>The \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 was also clear about Xiao Yan\u2019s intentions. Hence, it went all out in an attempt to resist it. However, at this moment, it had already become a fish on the chopping board. It was all up to Xiao Yan whether to kill it or cut it up\u2026</p><br/><p>Everything in this world was basically a cycle with ups and downs. Earlier, the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 could have refined Xiao Yan, but had failed due to various reasons. At this moment, it had become Xiao Yan\u2019s turn to call the shots. With his tactic, it was only natural that he did not give it up!</p><br/><p>The retaliation of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 was not of much use. Following the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 being poured in unceasingly, the resistance of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 was gradually reduced. However, this had at the very least transmitted a message to Xiao Yan. The will of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 had already begun to be eroded by the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019...</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan could suddenly hear a faint sound from the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 during the erosion. Although he was uncertain what the specific wording of this sound was, the taste of begging for mercy was extremely clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cBegging for mercy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth was lifted in a dense and cold manner. He laughed coldly, \u201cBack then, why did I not see you showing mercy to us when you were refining teacher and me? If not for my good luck, it is likely that I would have been swallowed by you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mind moved after the voice sounded. The speed at which the green flames were delivered became increasingly swift and ferocious. Xiao Yan was expressionless, and was not the least bit swayed by the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019s\u2019 attempt to beg for mercy.</p><br/><p>The erosion proceeded extremely slowly. However, Xiao Yan was not in a hurry. No matter how one put it, a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was something that possessed the greatest destructive strength in nature. The time needed for it to agglomerate its own will was a frightening number of years. Attempting to remove this will might not need such a long period of time, but one would be daydreaming if one thought they could achieve it in a short period of time.</p><br/><p>Time gradually flowed by under this dull erosion. Xiao Yan also appeared to be like an old monk meditating, unaffected by anything in the outside world. He gathered his mind and placed all his attention on that cluster of cream-white flame.</p><br/><p>Such slow corrosion proceeded for an unknown period of time. Perhaps it was a month, perhaps it was longer. The concept of time had became extremely vague in this place\u2026</p><br/><p>The green fire was being cycled without knowing fatigue within the green fireball. That cluster of cream-white flame had also transformed to its current silent and peaceful state compared to its intense struggle and resistance of the past. This clearly indicated that the will of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 was gradually disappearing\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCrack\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A slight cracking sound suddenly appeared within the quiet body. Following the appearance of this sound, Xiao Yan\u2019s quiet mind also leaped violently. He turned toward the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 wrapped by the layers of green flame. At this moment the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 was suspended within it. The cream-white cluster was warm and peaceful.</p><br/><p>The thread of will within the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame,\u2019 which had been originally filled with offensive and destructive properties, had finally disappeared after prolonged corrosion by Xiao Yan. The current \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 appeared as though it had just been born, and did not possess the slightest offensive properties.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave we finally succeeded?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mind awoke from the dormant-like state following the disappearance of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 consciousness. Although he did not exactly count the time, he could faintly feel that the erosion this time around had likely taken quite a bit of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how much time was consumed, it is far better than being trapped here forever\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan comforted himself within his heart. His mind moved, and the green fireball that had wrapped around the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 swiftly disappeared. That \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 was also suspended quietly. Its temperature was lowered such that Xiao Yan no longer felt a searing pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext, it should be the refinement\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled as he watched the cluster of \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. His mind controlled the cluster of \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019, and slowly moved it into his veins. After which, he began to move it along the route of the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 and quietly circulated it\u2026</p><br/><p>The refinement of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 without its consciousness was much easier than Xiao Yan had expected. Perhaps this was due to his body having been burned by the damn flame for such a long period of time, resulting in a tacit understanding that had faintly formed between the two. In any case, the refinement of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 this time around was smoother than when Xiao Yan had first refined the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019.</p><br/><p>Of course, despite the process being smooth, there was a similarity with the erosion of the will of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. That similarity was that it was still slow\u2026 slow to the point that it gave one the feeling of being about to collapse.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, no matter how frighteningly slow the process was, it would at the very least, ultimately reach its destination.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan once again woke up from his dormant state the moment the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 was successfully refined. His mind was watching the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 flowing within his Qi Paths. A joy slowly climbed from deep within his heart before eventually causing a happy smile to appear on the young man\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was in no hurry to control its merger with the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 after having refined the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. He clearly understood that this step was the most important one in the practice of the \u2018Flame Mantra,\u2019 and also the most dangerous step.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly opened his eyes and observed the whitish flame which was wrapped around him. He let out a soft laugh. Currently, the flame which originally had a great offensive strength against him had already become like his arm. Commanding it was extremely easy with no feeling of sluggishness.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze turned toward the bewitching beauty within the flame. The latter was still in a state where spirits were being merged. However, from looking at the increasingly substance-like spirit above her head, it was clear that she had already entered the final stage. Perhaps in only a short time, this Queen Medusa will have complete control over that body. At that time, she would truly make a complete transformation and turn into an extremely powerful person of the Dou Zong class!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes carelessly swept over Queen Medusa\u2019s lovely, naked body before quickly shifting it away. This woman was entirely filled with a kind of unusual allure toward men. Even without moving, as was currently the case, she still caused a nefarious flame to leap within one\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan finally controlled his mind after being quiet for a period of time. His expression was solemn as he extended his heart deep into his body, and began to attempt this last extremely critical step.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Those older students of the Inner Academy on the mountain slope opened their mouths slightly. They wanted to say something, but they were unable to say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The silence outside the forest continued for a while before those unmoving students could no longer resist the wild joy in their hearts. They let out a loud cheer. In their excitement, some of the new students did not even care about gender as they hugged the companions who stood beside them. Their five to six days of difficult struggles had finally paid off. How could they not rejoice?</p><br/><p>A smile also surfaced on Xiao Yan\u2019s pale-white face as he heard the happy cries that sounded from behind him. He held his chest and softly coughed a couple of times. He turned his head and eyed Xun Er and the other two, whose faces were also filled with joy. With a smile, he said, \u201cLooks like we do not need to hand over the things that we worked hard to come by,\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, are you alright?\u201d Xun Er hurriedly took two steps forward when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s expression. She supported him and asked with heartache.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. I am just out of strength.\u201d Xiao Yan waved his hand. The power of the \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 was not small, and its consumption of Spiritual Strength and Dou Qi was really too great. With Xiao Yan\u2019s current strength, he could only use it once in his prime condition. If he tried to forcefully use it a second time, he might descend into an unconscious state due to the exhaustion of his strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really unexpected that you really have some tricks. No wonder Xun Er constantly bore you in mind. It really is a pity\u2026\u201d Hu Jia carelessly patted Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders. Fighting side by side was usually the best way to improve the relationship between people. After these few days of living together, her heavy grudge that was formed because of Xiao Yan\u2019s tough attack during the Qualifying Competition had completely disappeared. From the bottom of her heart, the various things that Xiao Yan had shown these few days had really let her admire him.</p><br/><p>\u201cXun Er\u2019s sight is indeed not bad. However\u2026 I will work hard to catch up to you in terms of training.\u201d Wu Hao raised his head and his mouth pulled a somewhat stiff arc toward Xiao Yan. Clearly, this battle crazy person, who had a withdrawn character and was excessively obsessive in training, had seldom given anyone else a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He laughed and said, \u201cDon\u2019t push all the credit onto me. I know my own strength. Without your help, I would not be able to make it this far regardless of how strong I am. A lonely hero would not be able to walk far here and is also not suitable to be here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Jia and Wu Hao quietly nodded when they heard this. Not being proud because of success. The insolence and wild arrogance that a young person usually possessed seemed to be unrelated to this precocious young fellow. This trait really caused them to marvel.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Su, we have not lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Xiao Yan was speaking, a dissatisfied voice suddenly sounded out. Everyone\u2019s gaze swept around. It was actually emitted from Luo Hou, who was seated with his butt on the ground. At this moment, the latter\u2019s face was still flushed red. Clearly, his pride could not accept being defeated by the hands of a Da Dou Shi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. We have not lost. We can still fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other four members of the \u2018White Demon Group\u2019 also cried out together, echoing their leader after hearing him speak. From the appearance of the earlier fight, as long as they were given enough time, the new students would be completely defeated. Therefore, they were naturally unwilling to end up receiving a situation where they had lost.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you shut up!\u201d Elder Su\u2019s expression was solemn as he cried out coldly.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Elder Su had become angry, everyone hurriedly and wisely shut their mouths. They dared not say anything, including Luo Hou.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I had not intervened earlier, would you still have a life to be sitting here?\u201d Elder Su turned his head around, and asked Luo Hou sternly, whose face was filled with dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>Luo Hou\u2019s expression turned white. He clenched his teeth, but became dispirited a moment later. He clearly knew that if Elder Su had not intervened, it was likely that the Inner Academy would no longer have a student called Luo Hou.</p><br/><p>\u201cA loss is a loss. What excuse do you need to find?\u201d Elder Su snorted coldly. His gaze looked all around him as he said in a deep voice, \u201cI have already said that the \u2018Fire Energy Hunting Competition\u2019 this time around is already over. If you are still not satisfied, you can directly issue a challenge to the new students one month after they enter the Inner Academy. As long as they agree, the Fighting Arena of the Inner Academy is open anytime. However, for now, all of you should shut your mouths.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Su glanced once at Luo Hou before sweeping his gaze over at Xiao Yan\u2019s group once again. Only then did his expression become softer as he said, \u201cAs the victors of this year\u2019s \u2018Fire Energy Hunting Competition,\u2019 all the new students present will each obtain twenty days of \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019 Xiao Yan, Xiao Xun Er, Hu Jia, and Wu Hao will each obtain an additional \u2018Green Fire Crystal Card\u2019 and thirty days of \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreen Fire Crystal Card?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was some noise from the mountain slope upon hearing the words that had popped out of Elder Su\u2019s mouth. Numerous envious gazes swept over Xiao Yan\u2019s four man group.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Green Fire Crystal Card?\u2019 What is that?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s four man group, however, were somewhat at a loss with regards to this so-called \u2018Green Fire Crystal Card.\u2019 They exchanged glances with one another, feeling a little uncertain.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke. Within the Inner Academy, the Fire Crystal Cards, from the bottom to the top, are divided into black, blue, green, red, and purple colors. The black-colored Crystal Card in your hands is the lowest grade Crystal Card. This kind of Crystal Card can only give you the qualification to train in the first and second levels of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.\u2019 The blue card has the qualification to enter the third and fourth level and it continues on like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf one wanted to raise the Crystal Card grade, one would need to exchange for it with \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 within the Inner Academy. Usually, one would need to pay a hundred days worth of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 to exchange the black-colored Crystal Card to a blue-colored Crystal Card. In order to change a blue-colored Crystal Card to a green-colored Crystal Card, one would need two hundred days of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019... Now that you have obtained the \u2018Green Fire Crystal Card\u2019 as a reward, it is equivalent to you saving three hundred days of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019. This is not a small sum. Among the older students of the Inner Academy present, most of them are currently holding a blue-colored Crystal Card, with the exception of Luo Hou, who coincidentally changed his blue-colored Crystal Card to a green-colored Crystal Card last week.\u201d Elder Su smiled and explained after seeing the doubt of Xiao Yan and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree hundred days worth of \u2018Fire Energy?\u2019 Only after hearing this number did Xiao Yan and the others understand why the gazes of those around them were filled with envy. They had snatched from all of the older students in the forest until the latter were left with nothing. Adding that to this reward, each of their Crystal Cards had only just exceeded a hundred. From this, it could be seen that there should be some difficulty obtaining \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 within the Inner Academy.</p><br/><p>Once Elder Su had finished explaining, he shook his hand and four green-colored Crystal Cards appeared in his hand. He flicked his finger and the cards shot toward Xiao Yan\u2019s four man group, finally coming to a suspended stop in front of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reward is already in there. Draw all the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 in your Black Crystal Cards over. After that, hand the Black Crystal Cards back to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and the others quickly did as they were told when they heard what he said. A moment later, they handed over their Black Crystal Cards, which had become empty, over to Elder Su.</p><br/><p>Elder Su nodded slightly when he received the black-colored \u2018Fire Crystal Cards.\u2019 He smiled and said, \u201cAlright. Since you have already successfully completed the \u2018Fire Energy Hunting Competition,\u2019 follow me into the Inner Academy.\u201d Once he finished speaking, he took the lead to turn around, and slowly walked toward a stairs made of rock fragments that led up the mountain slope.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can finally enter the Inner Academy\u2026 it truly wasn\u2019t easy. Ah.\u201d Xiao Yan let out a long sigh when he saw Elder Su\u2019s back. He did not know just how much effort they had used in order to enter the Inner Academy. First, there was the Qualifying Competition, then there was the \u2018Fire Energy Hunting Competition.\u2019 This Inner Academy\u2026 was indeed not as easy to enter as he had thought.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Under everyone\u2019s gazes, Xiao Yan waved to Xun Er and the others and lead the way, following behind Elder Su as he climbed up the stairs.</p><br/><p>The fragmented rock stairs could not be considered to be very high. Xiao Yan\u2019s group managed to ascend to the last step after merely one to two minutes. After which, they raised their bodies and stood at the peak of the mountain slope. Their gazes swept around once in front of them. The scene, which appeared in front of them, caused them to slowly inhale a breath of somewhat icy-cold air.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the Inner Academy?\u201d A soft mutter was emitted from the mouths of those new students on the mountain slope.</p><br/><p>Behind the mountain slope was an extremely big basin with a depression. The shape of this basin was like it had been smashed and formed from an enormous rock falling from the sky...</p><br/><p>Tall buildings stood within the basin. Looking down from high above, everyone was able to see numerous, flea-like shadows flashing and jumping above the buildings. Their gazes focused in front of them, only to realize that the size of this basin was strangely large. The edge of their sight could only see the tall buildings and a lush green color but not the other side of the basin.</p><br/><p>It was difficult to imagine that there was actually such a unique ground hidden within the endless mountains behind the Jia Nan Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, little fellows, welcome to the place where the core of the Jia Nan Academy is located: The Inner Academy!\u201d Elder Su smiled as he eyed the shocked faces of the new students as he clapped his hands and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strong people here\u2026 so many.\u201d A fanatic enthusiasm rose on Wu Hao\u2019s face as he whispered to himself.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan helplessly smiled when he heard this. This fellow was really without a doubt a fighting maniac\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lifted his gaze and slowly swept it across the enormous basin. A moment later, he inhaled a deep breath of air as he muttered in his heart, \u201c\u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2026 is it really here? Hopefully, you will not disappoint me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright. Since the \u2018Hunting Competition\u2019 has concluded, all the new students, follow me back to the Inner Academy. I will help you all settle in. After that, you will all truly be members of the \u2018Inner Academy.\u2019 Trust me. As long as you are able to persist here, you will feel that everything is worthwhile when you see your improvements when you finally leave this place.\u201d Elder Su\u2019s gaze paused on Xiao Yan\u2019s group as he slowly said.</p><br/><p>All the new students nodded lightly. From those older students, they were able to discover just what kind of great benefits they would obtain if they trained in this Inner Academy!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go! Everyone, follow closely!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Su waved his hand. His body turned into a vague shadow as he swiftly rushed toward the enormous basin. Behind him, all the new students also immediately moved their bodies. Like locusts in transit, they rushed down from the mountain slope. Numerous excited bellows lingered over this place and did not disappear for a long time.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

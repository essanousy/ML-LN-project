He spoke with a clear voice, \u201cWhy does First Elder have the time to come here today?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old figure remained slowly suspended in the when he heard Xiao Yan\u2019s voice. He glanced at Xiao Yan who had a naked upper body and snapped, \u201cYou have stayed below for such a long time. I thought that you had met with a troublesome matter\u2026 Zi Yan and those fellows have repeatedly asked me if they could come down here. How can I agree to their request given the danger of this place? Hence, I can only come down on my own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed when he heard this. He pulled the snow-white ring that hid Tian Huo zun-zhe up his sleeve without drawing any attention. It was better to keep the matter of Tian Huo zun-zhe a secret. It would be more of a disadvantage than advantage if other people were to know about it. Although Xiao Yan trusted First Elder Su Qian, this was after all something related to an expert who was once an elite Dou Zun. Hence, it was best if fewer people knew about it.</p><br/><p>First Elder Su Qian naturally did not notice the little actions of Xiao Yan. His feet stepped on the empty air and paused at the cave. His eyes swept over Xiao Yan and he involuntarily let out an exclamation when he sensed the change in the latter\u2019s aura. He asked, \u201cYou have broken through?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He said, \u201cI have coincidentally broken through just before First Elder descended\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, you little fellow\u2026 this training speed is really a little too much like a monster. Back then, when I was still at the Dou Haung class, my fastest advancement took me around a year or so\u2026 but compared to you, it is really somewhat embarrassing.\u201d Su Qian helplessly shook his head. This fellow\u2019s training speed was really somewhat of a blow to others.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan rubbed his head and smiled. He did not tell First Elder Su Qian about the fire lizard people under the magma nor about the matter of the flame beads. It was best if no one else enters this place after he left. After all, there was a secret that was kept forever in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart at the bottom of the magma. The moment that the secret was revealed, it was likely that the entire Dou Qi continent would tremble because of it\u2026</p><br/><p>Something left behind by a Dou Di was enough to cause everyone\u2019s eyes to go red with envy and act crazy!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan randomly took a robe and placed it over his body. After which, he flipped his hand and the \u2018Flame Gathering Pot\u2019 appeared in his hand. He smiled secretively to Su Qian and said, \u201cFirst Elder, take a look and see what this is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, why? Have you stored the Heart Flame in it?\u201d Su Qian smiled when he saw this. After which, he received the \u2018Flame Gathering Pot\u2019 and glanced over it. His face instantly stiffened when he sensed the rising Heart Flame in his body a moment later. With his current strength, how could an ordinary Heart Flame maneuver the Heart Flame within his body?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 this is\u2026\u201d The stiffness on Su Qian\u2019s face continued for a moment. After which, Su Qian appeared to have recalled something and shock filled with disbelief instantly surged into his eyes. He felt dull when he looked at Xiao Yan again. Awhile later, he suddenly frowned and asked in a deep voice, \u201cHave you placed the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 into it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded when he heard this. He said, \u201cThis is indeed a genuine \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2026\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 ugh, why is it that you don\u2019t use your brain? I have already said that the Fallen Heart Flame\u2019s absence from the Inner Academy could save us some trouble. Now that you have already subdued it, taking it out again would harm you a ton! You might end up remaining at this level forever. How will you go and battle with the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 in this manner?\u201d Su Qian clenched his teeth and spoke with resentment that stemmed from Xiao Yan being unable to meet his expectations.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was stunned when he saw the First Elder Su Qian\u2019s manner. He immediately recovered after coming to a sudden understanding. It seemed that Su Qian had thought that Xiao Yan had taken the Fallen Heart Flame out of his body. Xiao Yan involuntarily laughed. A warmth also appeared in his heart as he did so\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder, you are mistaken. This is indeed the Fallen Heart Flame. However, it is not the one from the past. Otherwise, how could its might be so weak?\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head and softly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not the Fallen Heart Flame from the past?\u201d Su Qian was startled when he heard Xiao Yan\u2019s words. Only then did he recover. The Fallen Heart Flame in this \u2018Flame Gathering Pot\u2019 seemed to be a little too weak. It was far inferior to the horror of the Fallen Heart Flame in the past\u2026</p><br/><p>Su Qian held the Flame Gathering Pot with both hands. He was stunned for a minute before he seemed to have thought of something. A wild joy that was difficult to hid surged into his eyes as he joyfully said, \u201cYou mean\u2026 you have found another Fallen Heart Flame?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He said, \u201cThis Fallen Heart Flame is also something that was found in the magma world. However, it is currently still in its infant stage. As long as the Elders from the Inner Academy who practice fire affinity Qi Methods pour an unceasing amount of Dou Qi into it, the Heart Flame that it could provide would still enable the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower to once again regain its use. After more time passes, this Fallen Heart Flame might also be able to once again evolve and possess its own intelligence. At that time, it would definitely not reject the Inner Academy after the Inner Academy has groomed it for so long. Therefore, the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower might be able to remain open forever\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The joy on Su Qian\u2019s face became very dense while listening to Xiao Yan\u2019s gentle words. Clearly, he was extremely excited at being able to revive the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really unexpected that this magma world actually made another Fallen Heart Flame. Even the headmaster back then did not discover it\u2026\u201d Su Qian sighed first before shaking his head. After which, he held the Flame Gathering Pot as though it was a treasure and faced Xiao Yan with a face full of smiles. He said, \u201cIt has been tough on you\u2026 little fellow. You have taken away a matured \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 with a wild character that is difficult to tame, but end up returning to the Inner Academy an obedient infant \u2018Heavenly Flame.\u2019 All of this can be said to cancel each other out. Hence, you need not feel guilty in the future\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled slightly and nodded. Now, he was truly relieved. He also had quite the feelings for the Inner Academy. The Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower was extremely important to the Inner Academy. However, it had lost its effect because of him. He was quite happy that he was currently able to make up for it.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, with this thing, I will at least be able to account to the headmaster when he asks about it in the future\u2026 the Fallen Heart Flame is something that he had spent quite a lot of effort in order to seal. The establishment of the Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower is also the idea of him. If he were to return and see that this thing had lost its effect, it is likely that I will not be able to avoid being turned into a mess\u2026\u201d Su Qian\u2019s hand rubbed the Flame Gathering pot, and he sighed before laughing out loud.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan felt a little ashamed as he looked at Su Qian who appeared as though he had relieved a big burden. In that past, the First Elder had always said that everything was fine. Yet, his heart had actually been thinking about this matter to such an extent. However, it made sense if one thought about it. The Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower was so important. If it simply disappeared, even Xiao Yan\u2019s heart would unavoidably feel a disappointment.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, let\u2019s not talk about this\u2026\u201d Su Qian hurriedly waved his hand after appearing to have seen through Xiao Yan\u2019s thoughts. He smiled and said, \u201cOne of the reasons that I have entered this place this time round is to see if any accident happened to you. Another reason is to inform you that we have news about Han Feng.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHan Feng?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. The smile on his face was withdrawn slightly. A coldness also flashed in his eyes. That fellow had taken advantage of the chaos back then to flee. Xiao Yan had been thinking about this matter. After all, this fellow had remained in the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 for a period of time. He might be aware of the place where teacher was locked. Moreover, even if Han Feng was unaware of it, Xiao Yan must personally kill this person who had betrayed his teacher. Otherwise, how could he be worthy of Yao Lao, who had placed high hopes on him?</p><br/><p>\u201cEver since that fellow fled back then, he disappeared for a period of time. Originally, we would also have great difficulty finding him. However, a couple of days ago, Xiao Gate suddenly passed information saying that this fellow seems to have appeared at the Demon Flame Valley\u2026\u201d Su Qian slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDemon Flame Valley?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly. He immediately laughed coldly, \u201cLooks like this fellow is planning to take advantage of the death of the Old Ground Demon Ghost to completely take over everything that belonged to him\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye, Han Feng possesses great ambition. He has encroached deep into the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 and possesses a large network there. If he is given sufficient time, he would definitely become an overlord of the area. It is not difficult for him to achieve this with his status as an alchemist.\u201d Su Qian nodded and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time around, he has secretly took over the Demon Flame Valley and he did it in a quiet manner. If Xiao Gate hadn\u2019t been lucky, it is likely that they would have difficulty obtaining this information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. The corner of his mouth was lifted to form a cold expression. It was good as long as this fellow did not enter the vast mountain forest. As long as he was in the Black-Corner Region, Xiao Yan would have the confidence to capture this dog that had lost its home!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do?\u201d Su Qian glanced at Xiao Yan and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow cannot be let off no matter what. Otherwise, there will be a lot of trouble in the future.\u201d Xiao Yan slowly tightened his fist and softly said, \u201cGather some people. This time around, I will definitely not allow this fellow to flee alive. I need to know some information from his mouth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian smiled slightly and nodded. He said, \u201cIt seems that it is not impossible to capture him with the strength of our side\u2026 when will you act?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s hand grabbed toward the back of the cave. A black figure carried a clearly low whistle shot out. Finally, it transformed into a heavy ruler that fell into Xiao Yan\u2019s hand. He flipped with his hand and the heavy ruler was inserted behind him. The corner of his mouth was immediately lifted into a cold smile as he said in a dense manner, \u201cNow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulder shook slightly when his words sounded. A pair of beautiful jade-like bone wings slowly extended out. After which, the bone wings were flapped. A faint thunder roar resounded over this quiet magma world as Xiao Yan\u2019s figure turned into a blur that shot to the entrance hole!</p><br/><p>Su Qian involuntarily fondled his beard as he looked at the back of Xiao Yan which was filled with a killing aura. He muttered, \u201cWhat a pitiful Han Feng. Originally, he could have been considered a great authority within the \u2018Black-Corner Region.\u2019 In the end, he unluckily met Xiao Yan. It looks like the eyes of Yao zun-zhe have become sharper and sharper\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian also smiled gloatingly after saying this. After which, his footsteps stepped on the empty air as his body followed close behind Xiao Yan in a lightning-like manner.</p><br/><p>This time around, the fight between these two, who had the same teacher, will likely reach a conclusion!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

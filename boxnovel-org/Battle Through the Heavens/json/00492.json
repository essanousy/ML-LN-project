He felt the warm sunlight that scattered down from the sky and involuntarily had an introspective feeling. He opened both his arms before he suddenly laughed bitterly. It was really unexpected that this retreat, which was not even a month long, nearly caused his mind to be overly sensitive.</p><br/><p>Since the Heavy Xuan Ruler had basically become Xiao Yan\u2019s signature item at this moment, he did not frequently carry it on him in order to save some trouble. Although it would affect his training this way, it also caused Xiao Yan to have much less of a need to worry.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan followed the road and walked for nearly half an hour before he returned to the new student residence area of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate.\u2019 He eyed those guards standing as straight as a pen at the entrance and involuntarily praised quietly. It was really indeed as Xun Er had said. This \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 was basically undergoing changes like day and night. By observing the aura of just these few guards of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate,\u2019 it was likely that they were all around the peak of the Dou Shi class. Clearly, quite a number of members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 were training within the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 during this one month. Moreover, it appeared that the effects of the tower were quite beneficial.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly walked toward the entrance. Those few guards on sentry duty actually still remembered Xiao Yan\u2019s face. After being initially startled, some excitement swarmed onto their faces instantly. When the former walked closer, the few of them pulled their throat as they shouted in unison, \u201cChief!\u201d</p><br/><p>The loud and clear voices pulled over the gazes of some of the people coming and going. Xiao Yan parted his mouth, and smiled foolishly at the few of them and helplessly shook his head. He walked forward, patted one person on his shoulder before swaying leisurely as he walked into the new student area. He left behind the guard whose face was shocked from being favored due to Xiao Yan\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, after not having seen him for one month, Chief\u2019s strength appears to have advanced quite a lot. Looks like an elite Dou Ling will appear in our \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 very soon. At that time, we will not need to watch other people\u2019s expressions to do things.\u201d The guard, whose shoulder was patted by Xiao Yan earlier, could not help but part his mouth and speak with a smile as he eyed the partially visible back of Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cChe, who is the chief afraid of now? All of you have also recently been training frequently within the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.\u2019 Don\u2019t tell me that you have not even heard of that incident? Hee hee, shocking a four star Dou Ling until the latter lost his fighting strength with just one strike. How many people in this Inner Academy can do this kind of thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have also heard of that incident. Ha ha. Now, no other faction look down on us, like in the past, upon hearing that we are members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 while we are training in the tower. This is mostly because of Chief!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was naturally unable to hear the conversation of these guards. However, since he had entered the new students area until now, the occasional members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 coming and going would be initially startled upon seeing him before they immediately gave way. Their gazes were filled with respect and fear as they eyed Xiao Yan who walked past them with some doubt.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan walked back to the small pavilion home. After he entered the door, he discovered that Xun Er, Hu Jia, and Wu Hao were present. Even that Lin Yan was also unexpectedly in the hall.</p><br/><p>Xun Er was the first among the four people in the hall to discover Xiao Yan in the doorway. However, the one who had the most intense reaction was Lin Yan. One could see him jumping from the chair like a rabbit as his body moved toward Xiao Yan\u2019s side in a lightning-like manner. After which, he grabbed Xiao Yan\u2019s sleeves under the latter\u2019s stunned gaze and frantically scolded, \u201cYou, little fellow, are finally back. Hurry up. The \u2018Ice Spirit Pill\u2019 and the \u2018Marrow Washing Cold Spirit Liquid\u2019 have all been used up. I have already waited for you for three, maybe four days. If you did not return by tomorrow, I wanted to go into the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 to look for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan used all his might to pull back his sleeve which was pulled by Lin Yan. He rolled his eyes and said, \u201cWhy are you in such a hurry? You won\u2019t die just because the poison isn\u2019t expelled for one or two more days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan ignored Lin Yan after he said this. He walked into the hall and sat on a chair before speaking with a smile toward Xun Er and the two others, \u201cHow is it? Have there been any problems with \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 recently? That \u2018White Gang\u2019 did not make any movements, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, originally, there were still members who said that they had met some people from the \u2018White Gang\u2019 coming to find trouble while they were training in the tower during the first one to two days of your retreat. However, thanks to your recent prestige within the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 after that, now the \u2018White Gang\u2019 does not dare to be too presumptuous. They reduced some of those small actions. I think that your deterrence had some effect.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, there are currently quite a number of older students who were free agents that want to join our \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate.\u2019 After some assessment, the current size of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 is around a quarter larger than before your retreat. Moreover, the strength of those older students was not bad. Most of them have the strength of the Da Dou Shi class.\u201d Xun Er personally poured a warm cup of tea for Xiao Yan as she pursed her mouth and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He immediately smiled in a stunned manner and said, \u201cI only used Lei Na\u2019s matter to serve as a warning because I wanted to make it so that no one would disturb me during my retreat. It is really unexpected that there were these kinds of benefits\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, there is indeed some benefit. However, there is also quite a lot of disadvantage. You caused Lei Na to become bald. Now, he will grit his teeth upon mentioning you. Moreover, you even offended Liu Fei, that woman who is all chest and no brains. Originally, offending her is nothing. However, you should not forget what kind of person her older cousin brother is. Tyrant Spear Liu Qing. This name is not some nameless individual within the Inner Academy. Hee hee, if he wants to speak for Liu Fei, perhaps even your green-purple fire lotus could do nothing to his \u2018Mountain Splitting Spear.\u2019\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan returning, Lin Yan also calmed down his anxiety. He crossed the hall and coldly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow strong is that Liu Qing?\u201d Xiao Yan could not help but frown as he inquired upon hearing the name Liu Qing once again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can ask Wu Hao. Recently, he has lingered around the Fighting Arena frequently and should have some understanding of Liu Qing.\u201d Lin Yan shrunk back into his chair. He felt that explaining this kind of thing was the most troublesome. Hence, he merely curled his lips toward Wu Hao.</p><br/><p>Wu Hao shook his head helplessly when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze shoot over. He mused for a moment before saying, \u201cTyrant Spear Liu Qing is a top expert among the top ten of the \u2018Strong Ranking.\u2019 One can count the number of students in the Inner Academy who are able to defeat him with one\u2019s fingers. Additionally, in the Fighting Arena, he was one of the few extremely strong people who had once maintained eight consecutive victories. There are quite a number of people in the Inner Academy who view his name with reverence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan took a shallow sip of tea from the teacup in his hand and quietly nodded. With Wu Hao\u2019s strength, he still lost more than he won in the Fighting Arena where strong people were as numerous as the clouds. Hence, Xiao Yan could vaguely guess just how difficult the so-called eight consecutive victory was. It appeared\u2026 that this Liu Qing was indeed a person that was extremely difficult to deal with.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, you can rest assured that that fellow doesn\u2019t have the time to help speak out for Liu Fei for the time being. In another half a year\u2019s time, it will be the Inner Academy Grand Competition that is held once every five years. He is currently spending every day behind closed doors. Even if he occasionally has the time to come out from the tower, it would be to practice his Dou Skill in the Fighting Arena. Thus, he will not come and find trouble with you before the Grand Competition is over. After that, however\u2026 hee hee, it will be hard to say.\u201d Lin Yan gloatingly spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cInner Academy Grand Competition?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s brows formed a straight line as he asked feeling surprised, \u201cThere is this Competition? Why is it that I have never heard any news of it before?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Grand Competition has nothing to do with you\u2026 this is a competition between the experts on the \u2018Strong Ranking.\u2019 Ordinary people can only watch the fun from below. Hence, all of you naturally don\u2019t have the qualifications to know about it.\u201d Lin Yan curled his lips and said, \u201cAs long as one is able to enter the top ten in this competition, one will have the qualifications to become someone that can be chosen to become an Elder. Moreover, one would even obtain the qualification for a chance to enter the ninth level and receive the forging of one\u2019s body by the source of the Heart Flame!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what the source of the Heart Flame is? Simply put, if one was to receive the forging of one\u2019s body by the Heart Flame\u2019s source, one would obtain a pass that leads one to advance to the Dou Wang class provided that one was not someone who is so dreadfully unlucky. Do you understand if it is said in this manner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA direct pass to the Dou Wang class?\u201d When these few words entered their ears, the eyes of Hu Jia and Wu Hao became instantly hot. In the training of Dou Qi, the Dou Wang class was basically a watershed class that nearly opposed the heavens. Countless numbers of people, who had quite good training talent, were stuck at the edge of the Dou Ling class and were unable to take that one step forward for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeart Flame\u2019s source?\u201d</p><br/><p>Compared to the two of them, Xiao Yan placed his focus on this other vocabulary instead. Source\u2026 could it be that it is saying\u2026 the original body of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame?\u2019</p><br/><p>The teacup in his head trembled slightly. Some of the tea splashed out. Xiao Yan forcefully suppressed the shock in his heart as he slowly placed the teacup on the table. He raised his head and asked Lin Yan, \u201cWhat requirement must one have in order to enter the ninth level?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can forget about having such hope.\u201d Lin Yan rolled his eyes and replied faintly, \u201cPutting it simply, it is impossible for the students to enter deep into the ninth or tenth level. Only the Elders of the Academy have such qualifications. Therefore, most of those fellows who can graduate and leave, instead stay in the academy with the intention of becoming an Elder. This is because only by becoming an Elder will one be able to enter the ninth or even tenth level to train. This way\u2026 it would enable them to swiftly touch the barrier to the Dou Huang class.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA strong Dou Huang\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan gently sighed. He exchanged glances with Wu Hao by his side and saw a shock within the other party\u2019s eyes. This class could enable one to become an imposing authority of a group even when placed within the entire continent. It was really unexpected that some fellows within the Inner Academy actually had such ambition.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat \u2018Grand Competition\u2019... is it a competition that only those who have entered the \u2018Strong Ranking\u2019 can participate?\u201d Xiao Yan gently tapped his finger on the table and asked softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. After all, even if one were to lower the competence level, do you hope that some of those new students, the ones who entered the academy recently, are able to possess the qualification to be potentially selected as an Elder?\u201d Lin Yan\u2019s words were still that direct. He appeared to have forgotten that the four people in front of him were novices who had entered the Inner Academy less than two months ago.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan could only helplessly shake his head at the vicious tongue of this fellow. He raised his head slightly and eyed the ceiling. The glow in his eyes was flickering indefinitely. This was perhaps\u2026 an opportunity.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

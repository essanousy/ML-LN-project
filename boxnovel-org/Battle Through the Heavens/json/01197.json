There was a vague trace of Xiao Yan\u2019s legs weakening where it seemed he was about to fall to his knees.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly knit his brows when he sensed this change. This Three Thousand Burning Flame was indeed strange. Could it be that it has always treated itself as an Ancient Void Dragon?</p><br/><p>This thought flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s heart as he quietly became cautious. From the looks of the aura on it, this Three Thousand Burning Flame was far from what the Fallen Heart Flame could compare with. If he was careless, he might end up falling in the most unexpected place. At that time, it would be too late for him to feel regret.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan finally arrived in front of the large dragon a moment later as the hot eyes from everyone looked on. His body was suspended by the head of the dragon. Looking from a distance, he was insignificant when compared to the enormous body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>Upon encountering the Three Thousand Burning Flame at such close proximity, Xiao Yan truly sensed the deterrence that this large fellow emitted. If one were to talk about size, it was likely that Xiao Yan\u2019s height was similar to just the length of a dragon scale on the its body.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stood in front of the enormous dragon head. Although this Three Thousand Burning Flame\u2019s eyes were tightly shut, Xiao Yan\u2019s heart felt a strange feeling. It appeared as though this large fellow in front of him was using a kind of icy-cold gaze to observe him.</p><br/><p>This kind of feeling caused Xiao Yan\u2019s hairs to stand. He hurriedly focused his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, place your hand on the forehead of the Three Thousand Burning Flame. There is a dragon scale there covered by a purple-black flame. After which, insert your Spiritual Strength into it. If you are lucky, you might be able to subdue it.\u201d Qiu Ling\u2019s voice suddenly sounded behind Xiao Yan while he was quietly feeling surprised in his heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily let out a bitter smile when he heard Qiu Ling\u2019s instructions. How could it be so easy to subdue this Three Thousand Burning Flame? Although Xiao Yan thought this in his heart, Xiao Yan stepped forward as he was told. After which, he found the dragon scale that was his size. A flame was indeed burning over it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes swept over this dragon scale. He suddenly discovered that these dragon scales seemed to be covered with many spider-web-like black lines. These black lines intertwined and formed numerous extremely mysterious symbols that tightly adhered to the dragon scale. It appeared just like an incomparably large black web that wrapped around the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 a seal?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes twitched when he saw these black symbols. His eyes swiftly slid to the other dragon scales and did indeed see some of the other dragon scales were covered with these kinds of symbols made up of black lines. Immediately, he came to a sudden understanding in his heart. These should be the seals that Xuan Kong Zi\u2019s trio had joined hands to place.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a powerful sealing strength. It is many times stronger than the Fallen Heart Flame\u2019s seal in the Inner Academy back then\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan involuntarily felt speechless when he sensed the great strength of the seal. He did not dare to delay any longer. He took a step forward, and his hand gently touched the dragon scale the flame was lingering over.</p><br/><p>There was surprisingly not the least amount of warmth on his hand upon contact. Instead, there was a faint chill. However, Xiao Yan did not have any time to feel doubtful at this moment. His eyes were shut and the Spiritual Strength from between his brows carefully followed his arm and penetrated the dragon scale.</p><br/><p>The Spiritual Strength had just entered the dragon scale when Qiu Ling, Cao Ying, Old Mu Gu, and the others in the distance threw their gazes over.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>A slight sound was suddenly emitted when Xiao Yan inserted his Spiritual Strength into the dragon scale. Immediately, Xiao Yan\u2019s soul seemed to have been able to break through a layer as he appeared in a strange, empty place.</p><br/><p>Black-colored flames permeated this empty space. There was a miniature dragon in the center of the flames. However, at this moment, this small fire dragon was curled up with its eyes shut, appearing as though it was in slumber.</p><br/><p>When he saw this little fire dragon with its eyes shut, Xiao Yan was aware that this thing was the essence flame of the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan clearly understood that it was extremely difficult to obtain, this did not hinder the heated expression that appeared in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. The thing that he had dreamed of had finally appeared in front of him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath. He suppressed the excitement within his heart. The trace of Spiritual Strength belonging to Xiao Yan was slowly scattered. After which, it flew toward the small fire dragon before lingering over its body in a gentle manner. The Spiritual Strength continuously emitted a warm, friendly message.</p><br/><p>Although this kind of method appeared quite childish from Xiao Yan\u2019s point of view, he really did not possess any other solution at this moment.</p><br/><p>After this friendly message was emitted for a moment, Xiao Yan was speechless to discover that there was not even a response.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kind of method really doesn\u2019t work\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head in his heart. He was just about to withdraw his Spiritual Strength when he suddenly discovered that the small fire dragon, which had been keeping its eyes shut, suddenly opened them at this instant. Its eyes, which were filled with a purple-black flame, contained an icy chill as it stared at Xiao Yan\u2019s soul.</p><br/><p>All the pores on Xiao Yan\u2019s body opened at this moment. The skin on his head felt a little numb. This Three Thousand Burning Flame\u2019s essence fire was really not slumbering.</p><br/><p>\u201cFoolish human.\u201d</p><br/><p>That fire dragon suddenly spat out some icy-cold human words while Xiao Yan\u2019s hairs stood erect. The voice was filled with ridicule.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Three Thousand Burning Flame is able to speak the human tongue\u2026\u201d The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth immediately twitched when he heard its words. The Fallen Heart Flame from back then had appeared quite extraordinary to him. It was unexpected that this Three Thousand Burning Flame was even greater. It had used the human language and even knew how to mock others. This\u2026 a demon would really form in anything that lived long enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026 that, I have come here with the intention to rescue you and allow you to gain freedom\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan felt that he was an extreme hypocrite when he uttered these words. He was so much of a hypocrite that even his hairs appeared to stand up even more.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>The mocking expression within the eyes of the Three Thousand Burning Flame became even denser in the face of Xiao Yan\u2019s \u2018touching\u2019 words. At this moment, it did not utter any other nonsense. Two icy-cold words were emitted!</p><br/><p>Before Xiao Yan could say anything after the words sounded, the purple-black flame suddenly surged out of the body of the fire dragon. After which, it swept toward Xiao Yan in all directions.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed when he saw that this large fellow attacked as it pleased. He knew that he was definitely no match for the Three Thousand Burning Flame. Immediately, his wisp of Spiritual Strength began to hurriedly dodge and retreat.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan withdrew very quickly, but the purple-black flame was even faster. After a mere flash, it had already caught up to Xiao Yan. With a sweep, it swallowed Xiao Yan\u2019s soul into the flame. After which, it was vaporized into nothing.</p><br/><p>....</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan, who was touching that dragon scale with his hand in the Star Region, suddenly opened his eyes. He withdrew his hand as though he had been electrocuted. His heart felt a lingering fear as he quickly withdrew. This Three Thousand Burning Flame was\u2026 was a little too abnormally strong. It had vaporized his wisp of a soul.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan ruthlessly cursed within his heart. He wiped the cold sweat off his forehead before turning his eyes to Qiu Ling and the others. He spread his hands and said, \u201cI have failed. That fellow is too fierce\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Disappointment flashed across Qiu Ling\u2019s eyes when he heard this. He nodded and sighed, \u201cIn that case, the next person should step forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Mu Gu swiftly stepped forward after Qiu Ling spoke. A chill flashed across Qiu Ling\u2019s eyes when he saw who moved. He strode forward and blocked him.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, why? Does First Elder Qiu Ling not intend to allow me to give it atry? Looks like this so-called qualification from the Pill Gathering entirely relies on the whims of the Pill Tower.\u201d Old Mu Gu narrowed his eyes and coldly laughed when he saw Qiu Ling move.</p><br/><p>\u201cMu Gu, I advise you to not play any tricks. Otherwise\u2026\u201d Qiu Ling\u2019s tone was cold when he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I am able to subdue the Three Thousand Burning Flame, it will also help your Pill Tower get rid of a great calamity, would it not?\u201d Old Mu Gu smiled. After which, he side-stepped Qiu Ling and slowly walked to the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>The hand of Qiu Ling was slightly clenched. Immediately, his eyes slid to Xiao Yan, and he threw a look to Cao Ying\u2019s group, forcing them to pay more attention. After which, he turned around and followed beside Old Mu Gu like a shadow. A majestic Dou Qi lingered around him without any signs of being hidden. From the looks of it, Qiu Ling would immediately act should Old Mu Gu make any unusual movements.</p><br/><p>The corner of Old Mu Gu\u2019s mouth contained a cold smile in the face of being watched by Qiu Ling. His hand touched the dragon scale before he shut his eyes.</p><br/><p>When Old Mu Gu shut his eyes, Xiao Yan, Cao Ying, and the others also gathered their Dou Qi. If the former were to perform any tricks, it was likely that it would involve them.</p><br/><p>The expected unusual activity did not appear in front of everyone\u2019s cautious eyes. That Old Mu Gu suddenly opened his eyes after shutting them for around ten minutes. He immediately took two steps back. He slightly frowned as he cursed.</p><br/><p>Qiu Ling finally sighed in relief after seeing Old Mu Gu also step back in failure and that the Three Thousand Burning Flame, which was in a slumber, did not show any unusual activity. After which he spoke in a deep voice, \u201cNext.\u201d</p><br/><p>During the subsequent period of time, all the remaining people stepped forward one after another. However, everyone eventually returned after experiencing a miserable failure. Some of the weaker ones among them were even shaken to the point of spitting out a mouthful of fresh blood onto the dragon\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Qiu Ling by the side quietly sighed when the final person returned empty-handed. His eyes displayed a disappointment that could not be hidden.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince no one can subdue it, let\u2019s return\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qiu Ling waved his hand and helplessly spoke.</p><br/><p>While Qiu Ling was waving his hand, Xiao Yan suddenly saw the corner of Old Mu Gu\u2019s mouth slowly lift into a strange smile. His heart immediately tensed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, Qiu Ling, you will never be able to subdue the Three Thousand Burning Flame like this. Allow the old me to give you a good performance!\u201d</p><br/><p>This unusual laugh caused the expressions of everyone present to abruptly change.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

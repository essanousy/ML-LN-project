For some unknown reason, Yue Mei had the feeling that this face was somewhat familiar. However, she was unable to recall where she had seen it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou someone from the Jia Ma Empire?\u201d The snake pupils swept over the black-robed, young man in front of her while she asked with some caution.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan could not help but smile when he saw the alert manner of Yue Mei. He immediately nodded and said, \u201cRelax, I am someone from the Jia Ma Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Mei only quietly sighed in relief when she heard this. She had just struggled to stand up when the sore weak-feeling that was emitted from her body caused her to fail in her attempt. She could only let out a ferocious sigh. A round medicinal pill that emitted a serene fragrance appeared in front of her in her helplessness. A laugh soon followed, \u201cYou can try eating it if you are not afraid that it is poison.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Mei hesitated a little as she received the medicinal pill. A momentary struggle appeared in her heart before she finally clenched her silver teeth and swallowed the medicinal pill into her stomach. A warm medicinal strength immediately began to spread to her limbs and bones when the medicinal pill entered her stomach, expelling much of the weak feeling within her body.</p><br/><p>Yue Mei only began to completely relax upon sensing the change within her body. She raised her head and revealed a friendly smile to the black-robed, young man. She said, \u201cThank you very much. I am Yue Mei from the Snake-People Race.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan felt that it was somewhat comical in his heart. He studied this fierce beautiful female snake. She had clenched her teeth back then and intended to drag him back to be her male slave, but now she was displaying such a gentle smile toward him. He immediately turned his head over and threw his gaze toward the two middle-aged man whose expressions had become unusually dense and dark after he had appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful. These two people are experts from the Gold Geese Sect of the Luo Yan Empire. Their strengths are all at the Dou Wang class and cannot be underestimated.\u201d Yue Mei also recovered some strength with the medicinal strength of the medicinal pill. She moved her snake tail and lifted her lovely body. Those snake pupils looked at the two people in front in a dark and cold manner as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cGold Geese Sect?\u201d Xiao Yan raised his brows slightly and nodded in silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis friend, we should just keep to our own business. I advise you not to be a busybody. Otherwise, you might even throw your life away.\u201d The gloomy-faced middle-aged man stared intently at Xiao Yan as he slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>Currently, Xiao Yan had formally advanced into the Dou Huang class. It was only natural that these two people were unable to sense his true strength. However, from the way Xiao Yan had resolved their joint attack earlier, it was obvious that he was not weak. Hence, these two people held a fear within their hearts and did not immediately attack.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed when he heard this. His body, which was standing in front of Yue Mei, did not move. Although he did not say anything, his actions already told the two experts from the Gold Geese Sect of his intentions.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, you people from the Jia Ma Empire are really warm-hearted. I, Jin Zhen, admire it. However, if you insist on intervening, you can only blame yourself for having a poor fate!\u201d A denseness gradually rose within his eyes. That middle-aged man who called himself Jin Zhen laughed coldly and shook his head. He immediately spoke in a deep voice to his companion by his side, \u201cLet\u2019s attack together and kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>That companion smiled darkly and nodded. Given the strength of the two of them, they could be considered an overlord of a region even in the Luo Yan Empire. Perhaps it was their good luck, but during this period of time when they were fighting with the Jia Ma Empire, the two of them had seldom met anyone who was a match for them other than some of the renowned experts from the Yan Alliance. Hence, their hearts involuntarily looked down on the Jia Ma Empire.</p><br/><p>A bright golden glow surged out from their bodies after the words from the two of them sounded. A sharp golden glow lingered over their bodies and slowly rotated, leaving behind numerous scar like deep marks on the ground.</p><br/><p>Yue Mei\u2019s expression changed a little when she saw the action of these two as she stood behind Xiao Yan. Although she could guess that the latter was likely quite strong, there would definitely be quite a great risk if he were to deal with two expert Dou Wangs who collaborated well with each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will act and hold back one of them later. If you are able to defeat the other person, you should do it as quickly as possible. This is because I can at the very most endure for a short while.\u201d Yue Mei mused for a moment before gritting her silver teeth and speaking to Xiao Yan in front of her in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. However, he smiled and shook his head. He said, \u201cHow can you fight with your current injuries? You should rest. Leave them to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Mei was a little stunned when she saw that Xiao Yan was actually intending to fight the two alone. She turned her head and looked deeply into the young man\u2019s face which contained a smile. She softly said, \u201cIt is best that you don\u2019t overexert yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares if you are overexerting yourself. Today, quite a strong person\u2019s head will be added to the list of exploits of the both of us.\u201d Jin Zhen laughed coldly. He clenched his palm and a weapon with a somewhat unusual shape appeared in his hand. This weapon was somewhat like a golden ring but its outside edge was covered with a sharp hidden thorn. The purple glint that faintly appeared on the hidden thorn was clearly covered with a lethal poison.</p><br/><p>His companion also took out a similar item after Jin Zhen had taken out this weapon.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful, this is an unique weapon of the Gold Geese Sect, Goose Feather Ring. It is extremely tricky and vicious. Moreover, if it is used in collaboration with their Qi Method and can be quite strong.\u201d Yue Mei\u2019s face changed when he saw the weapons in the hands of the two individuals. She hurriedly warned.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, it is unexpected that you actually have quite a great understanding of our Gold Geese Sect. However, this cannot save both of your lives.\u201d Jin Zhen sinisterly laughed. He threw a look to his companion and the both of them immediately began to spread apart in an abrupt manner. One of them charged suddenly at Xiao Yan while the other person struck at Yue Mei who was behind Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes were as unmoving as an old well as he studied the two people who had swiftly flashed over. He slowly shook his head. They were merely two Dou Wangs. Even before he had broken through to the Dou Huang class, he could easily have killed them, much less now.</p><br/><p>Yue Mei watched the expert from the Gold Geese Sect who had taken a roundabout route and headed toward her. Her eyes immediately became cold and she clenched her hand. A sharp longsword appeared in her hand. Just as she was prepared to move, a hand suddenly grabbed her snow-white wrist.</p><br/><p>Yue Mei was surprised when her hand was clenched. However, she had yet to speak when Xiao Yan pulled her beside him. She raised her head and coincidentally saw that cold and indifferent smile that drew across that young face.</p><br/><p>Jin Zhen and the other person revealed dark, cold smiles on their mouths when they saw Xiao Yan\u2019s act of protecting Yue Mei. Both of their speeds suddenly soared and the Goose Wing Rings in their hands emitted a frightening cold glint under the golden light.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Ring Explosion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth moved just as the two figures entered within a ten-foot-radius from Xiao Yan. A cold cry was suddenly emitted.</p><br/><p>A jade-green circular fire ring suddenly began to spread in a lightning-like manner with Xiao Yan at the middle. In merely the blink of an eye, it violently struck Jin Zhen and his companion. A clear explosion immediately sounded on this plain.</p><br/><p>Gurg!</p><br/><p>The fire ring exploded and two figures, which were violently charging over, immediately stilled. They flew backwards in an extremely miserable posture and finally slowly came to a stop after rubbing on the ground for over ten meters. Mouthfuls of fresh blood were involuntarily spat out. They lifted their heads and their faces were filled with shock as they looked at the grinning black-robed, young man. None of them had ever expected that they would be so miserably defeated by a single attack.</p><br/><p>Their shocked gazes intertwined from a great distance. They seemed to have thought of something and cold perspiration immediately covered their foreheads. A disbelief was contained in their hoarse voice, \u201cDou Huang?\u201d</p><br/><p>The hearts of these two people were filled with a panic when they spat out these words. The young man in front of them appeared to be at the very most around twenty years old. The two of them might be able to grudgingly accept if one said that he was an expert Dou Wang. However, if he was a Dou Huang\u2026 was that not a little too terrifying? However, no matter how they flipped around within their hearts, the frightening energy that was contained in the fire ring was definitely only something that an elite Dou Huang could unleash!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince when did such a young elite Dou Huang appear in the Jia Ma Empire? Why have we never heard of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Mei also widened her small, sleek, red mouth in shock while a storm brewed within the hearts of Jin Zhen and his companion. She had similarly never imagined that this young person beside her would actually be an elite Dou Huang. Was this fellow\u2019s training talent not a little too frightening?</p><br/><p>Chi! Chi!</p><br/><p>Two muffled sounds appeared during the time when Yue Mei was stunned. By the time she raised her head, she could only see Jin Zhen and his companion wildly fleeing backs.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuickly, give chase. Don\u2019t let them escape!\u201d Yue Mei hurriedly cried when she saw that the two of them were attempting to flee. However, before her voice had finished talking, she was once again speechless as she discovered that Xiao Yan in front of her had already disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis speed\u2026\u201d Yue Mei\u2019s delicate hand rubbed the cold sweat on her forehead. She could not help but feel a lingering fear in her heart. It was fortunate that this person was an expert from the Jia Ma Empire. Otherwise, by just relying on this speed, it was likely that no one other than Her Majesty could match him.</p><br/><p>Two figures fell from the sky during the time that Yue Mei was wiping off her cold perspiration. Finally, they were thrown violently against the ground. She lowered her head to take a look only to see that they were the two Gold Geese Sect\u2019s experts, who had been fleeing earlier. However, it was obvious that those two people were no longer breathing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey ran quite quickly\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s figure also rushed down from the sky. He carelessly kicked the corpses and spoke in an indifferent manner.</p><br/><p>Yue Mei\u2019s eyes were startled as she stared at these two people who still ended up in such a state despite having clearly split themselves and fled in two directions. She once again studied Xiao Yan, who was slowly walking over in a leisurely manner. The cold sweat on her forehead became even denser. At this moment, his strength was definitely stronger than those few experts from the Yan Alliance who were at the peak of the Dou Huang class!</p><br/><p>\u201cMay I inquire about mister\u2019s name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yue Mei finally asked carefully after a few thoughts flashed across her heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily laughed when he saw Yue Mei\u2019s cautious manner. A teasing look surfaced on the corner of his mouth as he said, \u201cCommander Yue Mei, have you forgotten the little pervert who accidentally saw you bathing in the desert and was chased by you for hundreds of kilometers?\u201d</p><br/><p>The scene from the desert back then suddenly flashed and appeared in Yue Mei\u2019s mind when she heard this. She then looked at the somewhat familiar young face once again. A pair of alluring snake eyes suddenly widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

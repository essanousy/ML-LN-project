The thunderous blast caused everyone to involuntarily cover their ears. A long while later, they finally looked at each other with some palpitations remaining in their hearts before shifting their gazes to the training ground where dust blocked their view.</p><br/><p>Within the training ground, Xiao Yan slowly calmed his rapid breath. His face was somewhat pale. The imitation of the \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 earlier had a Dou Qi and Spiritual Strength requirement that should not be underestimated even though it required less this time and was not as terrifying as last time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith this amount of Dou Qi being required, it is likely that I can only use it three times before the Dou Qi in my body is completely exhausted.\u201d Xiao Yan muttered softly as he sensed the Dou Qi and Spiritual Strength in his body had sharply dropped. He immediately lifted his head and watched the opposite side which was shrouded by dust. As he waved his sleeves, a gentle breeze appeared and surged out, blowing away the suffused yellow dust.</p><br/><p>As the dust cloud settled, an eye-piercing enormous and deep pit immediately appeared within everyone\u2019s sight. Instantly, the corner of everyone\u2019s eyes in the training ground could not help but twitch.</p><br/><p>The deep pit was around four to five meters deep. Its area was also quite large. Numerous thick and deep crack lines repeatedly spread out like a spiderweb and nearly covering half of the open area.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he?\u201d Xiao Yan swept his gaze at the surroundings. However, he did not see Luo Bu\u2019s figure. At that moment, he blinked his eyes and said in a stunned manner.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*, *cough*...\u201d Just as Xiao Yan was feeling stunned, an intense coughing was suddenly emitted from the deep pit. Immediately, a hand began slowly rising from the pit and supported itself on the ground. Finally, a human figure that was charred black climbed out with great difficulty. Seeing his size, it appeared to be Luo Bu from before.</p><br/><p>Currently, in addition to Luo Bu\u2019s body being charred, numerous thumb size crack lines also covered the tough Dou Qi armor that he had summoned on his body. His body trembled slightly. The Dou Qi armor on him had already reached its limit, and finally emitted a muffled cracking sound. The seemingly mighty Dou Qi armor immediately began to slowly detach from Luo Bu\u2019s body, revealing the pale-white and terrified face under it.</p><br/><p>Eyeing the human figure which appeared to have just rolled over black charcoal, Xiao Yan probed, \u201cMister Luo Bu? Are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s inquiry, Luo Bu slowly lifted his head. He glanced at the delicate and handsome face of the young man and his body could not help but shiver. An extremely ugly smile appeared on his pale-white face. \u201cCompany Leader Xiao Yan. If that attack was a little closer, the current me would likely not even be left with a corpse at this very moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan eyed Luo Bu, whose Dou Qi around him had plunged to its lowest point. He understood clearly in his heart that Luo Bu knew that the defense of his Dou Qi armor was not enough to withstand the blast, however he did not choose to dodge. Instead, he simply stood on the spot like a wooden pillar, allowing the lotus flame to shoot over and finally explode in front of him. This action which appeared somewhat foolish would undoubtedly make him have to endure an extremely great explosive force. Therefore, even though Xiao Yan\u2019s strength was merely that of a six star Dou Shi, Luo Bu, who was a four star Da Dou Shi, still ended up with a serious injury that caused him to lose his ability to continue fighting from the explosion.</p><br/><p>Looking from the corner of his eyes, Xiao Yan saw bright red fresh blood was flowing down from Luo Bu\u2019s hand. Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes gradually became slightly gentler without him realizing. He slowly stepped forward and patted Luo Bu\u2019s shoulders as he said with a smile, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. This is the first time I had modified this thing so I was unable to control its strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, never mind. It should be fine after resting for a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>After being a mercenary company leader for more than ten years, Luo Bu was extremely sensitive as he felt the gentleness that Xiao Yan had displayed. Immediately, some joy and excitement faintly appeared in his heart. He knew in his heart that ever since the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 had nearly destroyed the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019 the last time, within the heart of this young man who appeared friendly, there had always been some enmity and even\u2026 killing intent toward him.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Luo Bu\u2019s heart also knew that if Xiao Yan wanted to expand the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019 strength in a short time, it was difficult for the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 to escape the fate of being destroyed. Luo Bu, who had witnessed Xiao Yan turn a living person into an ice sculpture without any expression, did not doubt that this young man whose age was still quite young, possessed a ruthless heart.</p><br/><p>Although the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 had currently been merged into the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019, Luo Bu was able to sense that the doubt and the guard that Xiao Yan held toward him had not reduced. Regarding this, Luo Bu could only laugh bitterly. During this one month that he had been in the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019, he had obtained an even clearer understanding of Xiao Yan\u2019s ability. Under pressure from Xiao Yan\u2019s almost terrifying strength, the somewhat rebellious thoughts that he originally held in his heart had completely been extinguished. It could be said that the current Luo Bu had already began to gradually think of himself as a member of the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019 in his heart instead of the Company Leader of the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019...</p><br/><p>However, even though Luo Bu\u2019s heart thought in this manner, Xiao Yan had remained on his guard against him. This caused Luo Bu to feel a helpless bitterness in his heart. Naturally, he also clearly knew that this was human nature and he could not blame anyone.</p><br/><p>Just as he thought that this kind of prejudice from Xiao Yan would persist on, however, Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze, which suddenly became gentle, caused Luo Bu to be surprised. At the same time, he was somewhat excited to realize that his action of being willing to risk his life to be a target had actually accidentally resulted in a great reduction in the guard Xiao Yan held against him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis injury was worth it...\u201d Luo Bu muttered in his heart. A somewhat excited redness appeared on his pale-white face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan patted Luo Bu\u2019s shoulders, took out a high-grade healing medicine from within the storage ring and passed it to him. He said with a smile, \u201cTreat your injuries first. Once your injuries have been healed, you will be the true core in the upper echelon of the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019. With your strength, the responsibilities that you have to take won\u2019t be small. The \u2018Desert Metal Company\u2019 is currently at an expansion period. In the future, you may have to toil harder.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words of Xiao Yan undoubtedly meant that he had really started to trust Luo Bu.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when Luo Bu heard these words, even the hand which he used to receive the healing medicine trembled. He might not have overly cared about the trust of other people but the trust of a strong person, especially the extremely strong people like Xiao Yan and Hai Bo Dong, was sufficient enough to cause Luo Bu to feel excited and honored.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompany Leader, you can be rest assured that I will ensure that the brothers from the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 will truly become members of the \u2018Desert Metal Company\u2019.\u201d Luo Bu held the jade bottle tightly. His body bowed slightly toward Xiao Yan as he said somewhat excitedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as you can place your thoughts on the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019, trust me, the benefits that you receive in the future will be something you will find hard to believe.\u201d Eyeing Luo Bu who was excitedly expressing his loyalty, Xiao Yan smiled and spoke in a profound manner.</p><br/><p>Hearing the joking and somewhat mysterious words, Luo Bu was momentarily stunned before he immediately responded politely.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, you should quickly heal your injuries. Tomorrow, Old Hai and I will be leaving the Rock Desert City. Your strength is the strongest in the \u2018Desert Metal Company\u2019, therefore, during this period of time that I am away, I may need you to take more care of the \u2018Desert Metal Company\u2019.\u201d Xiao Yan said softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave?\u201d Hearing this, Luo Bu asked in a somewhat strange voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am going to the capital. There are some things over there that are waiting for me to settle.\u201d Xiao Yan carelessly smiled and once again patted Luo Bu\u2019s shoulders. Immediately, he turned around and slowly walked out of the training ground.</p><br/><p>Watching the steady back of the black clothed young man, Luo Bu let out a few coughs. He calmed his excited heart before nodding heavily.</p><br/><p>At the edge of the open ground, where numerous respectful gazes were watching him, Xiao Yan came to Xiao Ding\u2019s and Xiao Li\u2019s side. He faced the two of them, both still wore amazement filled faces and he smiled then asked, \u201cAren\u2019t you going to return to yourselves?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Fellow, I had originally thought that you had randomly chose Luo Bu to become your target. It\u2019s really unexpected that you would actually use this action to appropriately settle this greatest potential threat within the mercenary company.\u201d Xiao Ding swept his gaze at Luo Bu who was in the training ground and spoke softly to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled slightly, but remained noncommittal about his own intentions. Raising his head to eye Hai Bo Dong who was slowly descending from the sky, Xiao Yan softly said,\u201cI have no choice. Tomorrow, Old Hai and I will have to leave the Rock Desert City. If I don\u2019t think of some methods to remove some potential threats, I would not be able to leave with peace of mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are going to leave tomorrow? So soon?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Ding and Xiao Li were at a loss as they pressed their eyebrows together and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Originally, I had prepared to leave for the capital a month ago. However, because of my injuries, I ended up dragging my stay for so long. Now, I cannot continue to delay.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you really intend to go to the Misty Cloud Sect a month later?\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s smiling face, Xiao Ding\u2019s voice suddenly became low and soft as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I must go there!\u201d Xiao Yan pursed up his lips and nodded slightly. His voice was slow but firm, without the slightest uncertainty.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Misty Cloud Sect is a really big being. It won\u2019t be easy to deal with them\u2026 Moreover, the First Elder of the Mo clan, Mo Cheng died in your hands. Although you have hidden your identity, it may have been seen through if you were to appear at the Misty Cloud Sect again. When that time comes, even if you successfully manage to defeat Nalan Yanran, I\u2019m afraid that those old fools of the Misty Cloud Sect would not easily let you leave the mountain without any injuries.\u201d Xiao Ding said with worry.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they really intend to act like this when the time comes, then they should prepare to have a life and death struggle\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan laughed faintly. He raised his head and eyed Hai Bo Dong who had descended on a huge rock beside them. He shrugged and laughed, \u201cOld Hai, do you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour elder brother is right. The Misty Cloud Sect isn\u2019t so easy to deal with\u2026\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan looking over, Hai Bo Dong smiled bitterly, \u201cHah, whatever you want. Who asked me to be held by you. One year of being a bodyguard, ah, from the looks of it now, it appears that you have started scheming against me long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, a Dou Huang that had been delivered to my doorstep. If I just allowed Old Hai to easily leave, would it not be a huge waste?\u201d Eyeing Hai Bo Dong\u2019s helpless face, Xiao Yan joked.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Hai Bo Dong could only smile bitterly and shook his head.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan extended his head into the tree branches at the side to pluck a leaf. He then placed it in his mouth and chewed slightly, allowing the faint bitterness to spread in his mouth as he turned his head to eye the distant north. In that direction sat an enormous being of the Jia Ma Empire, the Misty Cloud Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see the situation when that time comes. If they really give us no way out, then even if I have to push myself until I am seriously injured, I will throw a real \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 at the Misty Cloud Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>The calm muttering voice of the young man caused a helplessness to surface on Hai Bo Dong\u2019s face. He smiled bitterly, shook his head and sighed, \u201cWhat a lunatic\u2026 the Misty Cloud Sect would have a hard time bearing the consequences by provoking you, even with its strength.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

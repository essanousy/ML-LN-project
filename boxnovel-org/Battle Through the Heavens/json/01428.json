He was well aware of the strength of the Soul Destruction Palm. An ordinary nine change peak Dou Zun expert would not be able to receive it, much less head-on, because the palm contained a dark chilling energy that eroded one\u2019s soul, yet his powerful palm was insignificant to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo the members of the Hun clan only possess such tricks\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s figure walked through the air. He looked down at Hun Yu, who wore an ugly expression, and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, you should not be too arrogant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Yu\u2019s expression was a dangerous dark as he stared at Xiao Yan. His heart was filled with dissatisfaction. He clearly understood that Xiao Yan would not have been a match for him if Xiao Yan had not trained for one month within the Bodhisattva Ancient tree, but none of the many possible situations that could have occurred were reality\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled when he heard Hun Yu\u2019s dark and chilly cry. Xiao Yan\u2019s hand was suddenly swung and a large cluster of hot flames erupted from his sleeve. After which, the flames formed a thousand-foot-large fire hand that grabbed at Hun Yu with lightning-like speed.</p><br/><p>Hun Yun clenched his teeth in dissatisfaction when he saw Xiao Yan attack. Black fog surged from his body before turning into many ferocious black fog beasts. They wildly cried out as they pounced toward the large fire hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The large fire hand slammed toward these black beasts. When the ferocious black fog beasts collided with hand, they were all blasted into smoke in an instant. After which, they were vaporized by the frighteningly high temperature.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow stubborn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan faintly smiled upon seeing this outcome. He waved his sleeve and the large fire hand suddenly flashed. It was above Hun Yu\u2019s head when it next appeared before it was ruthlessly slammed down.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The large fire hand smashed into Hun Yu\u2019s body since he could not dodge it. The black fog that lingered over his body scattered as a hot and powerful wind poured in to it through all his pores.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dou Qi within Hun Yu\u2019s body did not have time to form a defense against this extremely hot and wild wind. As his body was being forcefully torn apart by that unusual heat, more wind entered it like poisonous snakes. His expression paled as a mouthful of bright-red fresh blood was spat out. His body also shot backwards and landed on the ground\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The group of neutral experts in the distance gently inhaled a breath of cool air as they watched Xiao Yan severely injure Hun Yu with just a palm strike. Their hearts rejoiced since they had not greedily intervened earlier. Otherwise, they would have been left even more miserable than Hun Yu.</p><br/><p>After sending Hun Yu flying with a palm, Xiao Yan glanced at the chaotic battleground a short distance away. He let out a cold laugh as his hand launched toward the battle. A couple of punches were thrown into the air and a frightening wind penetrated empty space before smashing into the bodies of a couple of Hun clan\u2019s and Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe\u2019s experts. A powerful strength caused those people to spit out blood and fly back.</p><br/><p>This unexpected change caused Jiu Feng\u2019s group to start. They hurriedly shifted their eyes and saw Hun Yu lying on the ground with an unknown fate. Their expressions underwent a drastic change.</p><br/><p>\u201cHun Yu has actually been finished off this quickly?\u201d A monstrous wave of turmoil rose within Jiu Feng\u2019s heart. Even he was unable to defeat Hun Yu within such a short period of time, yet Hun Yu appeared like a dead dog within less than ten minutes in Xiao Yan\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you planning to fight personally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes shot toward Jiu Feng. His faint voice caused Jiu Feng\u2019s hand to tremble. Jiu Feng\u2019s face was volatile, but he ultimately did not say anything. Hun Yun was defeated so miserably, even less needed to be said of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe situation today is hopeless. This brat has already become very strong. Only those grand Elders within the tribe can finish him off\u2026\u201d Jiu Feng\u2019s eyes flickered. Finally, he swallowed the fury and murderous intent within his heart. Revealing any intention to kill at this moment would only result in a fate similar to Hun Yu.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan glanced at Hun Yu in the distance, who was struggling to climb to his feet. After suppressing everyone with his words, a murderous desire surged within his heart. He and the Hun clan were enemies who would not rest until the other party died. This Hun Yu was one of the most outstanding individuals among the younger generation of the Hun clan. If he could kill him, even the Hun clan would feel some pain. Since this was the case, he could not let the people from the Hun clan off no matter what.</p><br/><p>\u201cRustle rustle!\u201d</p><br/><p>While Xiao Yan had made up his mind to retain Hun Yu\u2019s group in this place forever, the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree, which had been standing quietly in the middle of this space, suddenly emitted a rustling sound before wave after wave of ripples began to appear\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this realm about to collapse\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled after seeing these ripples form. He immediately knit his brows. The Bodhisattva Ancient Tree would not continue to exist in the world forever. After it had spat out its Bodhisattva Seeds, it would once again sink into the land and rest. It would only break out of the land after gathering its energy, but no one knew when that would be\u2026</p><br/><p>The unusual change caused everyone to panic. The battlegrounds also quickly scattered as the Hun clan members quickly lifted Hun Yu up. After which, they clustered together with the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe. Their eyes were cautious as they glanced between Xiao Yan and the surrounding space.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Hun Yu, are you alright?\u201d Jiu Feng glanced at the pale-looking Hun Yu and softly inquired.</p><br/><p>Hun Yu wiped off the trace of blood from the corner of his mouth. He slowly shook his head as his eyes ruthlessly glared at Xiao Yan. A moment later, his lips trembled. Jiu Feng\u2019s body stiffened before he clenched his teeth and nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cRustle rustle rustle!\u201d</p><br/><p>The spatial fluctuation became more intense as everyone pulled back. Suddenly, a crack line appeared and a glaring light pillar shot out from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrack crack crack!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the first crack appeared, an increasing number of spatial slices continued to surface. Within a short few minutes, the extremely solid space had gained thousands of holes. Finally, it exploded in front of everyone\u2019s panicked eyes\u2026</p><br/><p>The deepest part of the Ancient Wasteland Region\u2014</p><br/><p>An enormous Bodhisattva Ancient Tree stood alone within this grassland. Majestic and refreshing air continued to spread from it in all directions, revealing a spectacular scene.</p><br/><p>A couple of figures sat a short distance away from the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. They were Nalan Yanran and the rest who had been left behind. There were also some other experts who had charged through the beast tide. Everyone present had fully healed from their injuries, but they were unwilling to simply leave. Hence, they continued to stand guard.</p><br/><p>\u201cRustle rustle!\u201d</p><br/><p>A rustling sound suddenly appeared within the quiet grassy plains. The Bodhisattva Ancient Tree in the middle of the field had not moved for a month, but all of a sudden, it began to unleash a glaring emerald light. Soon after, many miserable figures escaped this light and landed on the surrounding ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>This sudden scene caused everyone to be startled. A wild joy rose as Nalan Yanran\u2019s group hurriedly stood up. Their eyes were happily looking at a figure a short distance away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have finally exited\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Qing Yang\u2019s group inhaled a deep breath of the fresh grassland air. They felt an elation from having survived a calamity. How could an outsider imagine the kind of danger they had experienced during this short one month? That frightening illusion would still remain in their minds after a long time.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently exhaled. His transformation had been the greatest during this one month. While it had only been a month in the eyes of others, he had experienced a hundred reincarnations. The reincarnation training might not have allowed his strength to truly soar, but it had unknowingly left behind something that could influence\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cRustle rustle!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Bodhisattva Ancient Tree began to tremble after the last person was tossed out. A circular light was unleashed from beneath the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. The ground seemed to turn into liquid because of this light, and the Bodhisattva Ancient tree slowly entered the earth through this liquid\u2026</p><br/><p>The expressions of many people changed upon seeing the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree enter the ground. Their hearts were filled with dissatisfaction. Even an elite Dou Sheng would not be able to find the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree once it went underground. In other words, the next time one could see the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree would be when it appeared in the world again. Perhaps thousands of years would already have passed by then.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, unfortunately, we did not find the Bodhisattva Heart\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Qing Yang softly sighed and lamented somewhat regretfully as he watched the Bodhisattva Ancient tree slowly sink into the ground.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan, who had heard these words, sort of smiled. His hand gently rubbed the spot of his chest where a pounding emerald-like crystal clear heart now resided. This was the legendary Bodhisattva Heart, but Xiao Yan had yet to refine it. Once he truly refined it, he would be able to step into the Dou Sheng class!</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Bodhisattva, thank you very much. Hopefully, we will be able to meet again in the future\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan softly muttered as watched the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree sink deeper underground. His heart felt some regret. This Bodhisattva Ancient Tree did not possess a true intelligence. Otherwise, it would have been a genuine expert within the Dou Qi continent. If he could have befriended it, the aid it would have provided would have been incredible.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Bodhisattva Ancient Tree finally sank into ground in front of many pairs of eyes. After the final trace of emerald light disappeared, these grassy plains once again became empty\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan softly sighed in his heart as he watched the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree completely disappear. He was just about to speak when his expression suddenly changed. The space around him had suddenly become extremely distorted. It was like a prison had sealed them\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His body did not dare to even move a little. He knew that if he dared to make even the slightest unusual movement, his head would be smashed into pieces with a \u2018bang,\u2019 appearing just like a watermelon that had landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>Bing He\u2019s body maintained his pose of being about to climb to his feet. He swallowed a mouthful of saliva. A moment later, he quietly turned around a little and spoke in a hoarse voice, \u201cIf you kill me, this Pill Region will have nowhere that you can hide!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan looked down at the pale-white face of Bing He from above. However, he merely laughed and said, \u201cSince I have intervened, I am naturally not afraid of whatever Ice River Valley of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, what an arrogant tone. Don\u2019t think that you possess the qualification to fight with the Ice River Valley by possessing an eight star Dou Zong spiritual body and puppet. My strength is merely ranked among the weakest among the Elders of the Ice River Valley. Moreover, even Bing He and Bing Yuan are ranked at the middle. If the true experts from my Ice River Valley come out, the capital that you are proud of will immediately become not even worth mentioning!\u201d Even though Bing had sensed the the situation was a little wrong after hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words, he still involuntarily let out a cold laugh.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. This Ice River Valley was also one of the three valleys. It was likely that its strength was not weaker than the Burning Flame Valley. Just the third Elder of the Burning Flame Valley alone had the strength of an eight star Dou Zong. That second Elder had already reached the peak of the Dou Zong class. Of course, the most frightening person was naturally the Burning Flame Valley\u2019s Tang Zhen. Even with Xiao Yan\u2019s eyesight, he could only describe Tang Zhen with the words \u2018unfathomable.\u2019 Although it was extremely difficult for Xiao Yan to accurately determine how strong or weak a Dou Zun class expert was, his instincts told him that Tang Zhen\u2019s strength was definitely even stronger than Lei zun-zhe from the Wind Lightning Pavilion!</p><br/><p>Since the Burning Flame Valley possessed such strength, the Ice River Valley, which was ranked alongside it, would definitely not be weaker. Hence, Xiao Yan did not doubt what Bing He had said. Before he had come to the Pill Region, he had already understood that he would be enemies with the Ice River Valley after rescuing the Little Fairy Doctor. However, with Xiao Yan\u2019s character, would he just abandon the Little Fairy Doctor just because of the strength of this Ice River Valley? Back then, when he was merely a small Dou Zhe, who had just stepped onto the path of Dou Qi training, he had already dared to oppose the great being of the Jia Ma Empire. Even less needed to be said now\u2026</p><br/><p>Bing He looked at Xiao Yan\u2019s silence and thought that he had a change of mind. His tone had also become a little calmer as he said, \u201cIf you take the initiative to hand the body of that Woeful Poison Lady to the Ice River Valley, my Ice River Valley will definitely not let you lose out. With your talent, you will definitely be placed in an important position by the Valley Chief. It should be known that our Valley Chief loves getting to know experts from all over the place\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bing He\u2019s words had just sounded when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s face slowly turn gloomy. Immediately, a chill rose within his heart. His hand slammed against the ground as he hurriedly withdrew with the help of the pushing force.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, his body had just moved when a cold smile surfaced on Xiao Yan\u2019s face. His leg kicked out in a lightning-like manner. It ruthlessly struck Bing He\u2019s body. The powerful force caused his body to fly like a kite with a broken string. After which, he heavily smashed into an enormous rock. The sound of bones cracking could faintly be heard.</p><br/><p>Droplets of cold perspiration continuously surged onto Bing He\u2019s forehead as he slowly rolled down from the large rock. He raised his head and his eyes looked at Xiao Yan viciously. He furiously roared, \u201cLittle bastard, you will sooner or later regret these actions of yours today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Boom!</p><br/><p>Bing He\u2019s roar had just sounded when a white figure suddenly shot over from the sky. It immediately smashed into the enormous rock beside him. A mouthful of fresh blood was spat out. After which, this figure slowly rolled down like a corpse, appearing just like a pile of mud.</p><br/><p>Bing He hurriedly turned his head and shock immediately surged into his eyes. He could see that the figure was actually Bing Fu. However, his entire body was covered with fresh blood. His breath was extremely weary and he appeared close to death.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, it is really troublesome without a body. It is this annoying just to deal with a Dou Zong\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>An elderly figure slowly appeared beside Xiao Yan. This person was naturally Tian Huo zun-zhe. He glanced at the mud-like Bing Fu and laughed, \u201cI really had an enjoyable time beating him up. However, you can rest assured that the old me made sure that he still had a breath left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. He softly said, \u201cOld mister Yao, you can rest assured that the matter of the medicinal ingredients are more or less settled. It is likely that you will be able to soon possess a body once again.\u201d</p><br/><p>A joy that was difficult to hide surfaced on Tian Huo zun-zhe\u2019s face when he heard this. The matter of his body was something that he had always been concerned about. After hearing these words of Xiao Yan, it seemed that the day would not be far away\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fellow, you are really reliable. Ha ha, the eyesight of the old me is as good as ever\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A glint immediately flickered in the eyes of Bing He when he heard Tian Huo zun-zhe\u2019s words, \u201cThis elder, our Ice River Valley specializes in refining bodies. Moreover, the bodies that we create will possess some special ability. As long as you help my Ice River Valley perform one task, you will be able to obtain it for free.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Xiao Yan\u2019s face was withdrawn. Dense, cold killing intent gradually surged within his eyes.</p><br/><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe was also startled because of Bing He\u2019s words. He glanced at Xiao Yan. A strange smile appeared on his face a moment later. He slowly walked to Bing He, lowered his body, and slammed his hand gently on his back. He smiled and said, \u201cDo what? We can discuss it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp the Ice River Valley capture the Woeful Poison Lady. My Ice River Valley can help you refine a body that you will be extremely satisfied with.\u201d A wild joy surged over the deep regions of Bing He\u2019s eyes when he heard this.</p><br/><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe slowly nodded. After which, his hand gently shifted to Bing He\u2019s neck. He also sensed this abruptly and all the pores on his body immediately opened up. He threw a palm toward Tian Huo zun-zhe in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrack!\u201d</p><br/><p>The wind from the palm had yet to reach Tian Huo zun-zhe when his expression turned slightly cold. His hand suddenly used some strength and Bing He\u2019s neck was broken amid a cracking sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fellow, you should not give such a person the chance to speak in the future. Otherwise, an unexpected change might occur sooner or later\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe randomly tossed aside the ice-cold Bing He before turning his head to Xiao Yan and speaking in a faint manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan quietly relaxed his tightly clenched fist. He nodded to Tian Huo zun-zhe, cupped his hands together, and said, \u201cThank you for your reminder old mister Yao. The battle on the other side should also be ending\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A silver glow immediately rushed out of the mountain stream after his voice sounded. After which, it appeared in front of Xiao Yan. At this moment, the hands of the Earth Demon Puppet held a bloody-faced Bing Yuan. When he saw Bing Fu, who was like a pile of mud and Bing He with his neck broken, a viciousness immediately shot out of his eyes. He stared intently at Xiao Yan as he said with a hoarse voice, \u201cLittle bastard, all of you will not be able to escape!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan faintly smiled. He received the seriously injured Bing Fu from the hands of the Earth Demon Puppet. After which, his eyes turned to those disciples from the Ice River Valley. He commanded, \u201cKill them, leave no one alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Earth Demon Puppet immediately flashed out when these words sounded. It charged into the group of Ice River Valley\u2019s disciples like a ferocious tiger. Immediately, numerous miserable screams sounded from the edge of this mountain stream.</p><br/><p>Under the fierce might of this Earth Demon Puppet, only four of these Ice River Valley\u2019s disciples managed to flee. However, their speed was far inferior to the Earth Demon Puppet. They were all caught after a brief chase. After which, they toppled over like wheat in the hands of the Earth Demon puppet.</p><br/><p>The Earth Demon Puppet, which was covered with the scent of blood, finally returned after having killed all the disciples from the Ice River Valley within the shortest amount of time. The spiritual avatar of Xiao Yan also returned along with it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan returned the spiritual avatar to between his eyebrows. After which, he turned his eyes toward the quivering Bing Fu and smiles as he said, \u201cI wish to know something\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Bing Fu\u2019s eyes stared viciously at Xiao Yan. He did not expect Xiao Yan to be so ruthless. He had killed all of them off!</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bastard, don\u2019t think that the Ice River Valley will not be aware of what has happened here by killing everyone. Just wait, a short while later, you will become the wanted target of the Ice River Valley. At that time, there will not be a single place you can hide in the Pill Region!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly frowned. He curled his fingers as a wisp of a jade-green flame slowly rose. After which, it was gently pressed on Bing Fu\u2019s shoulder. A wave of \u2018chi chi\u2019 sounds was immediately emitted from where Xiao Yan\u2019s fingers landed. Bing Fu\u2019s face had also become distorted from the intense pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wish to know what that Ice Zun Force is you mentioned earlier.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan withdrew his finger after watching Bing Fu\u2019s distorted face and demanded an answer.</p><br/><p>Bing Fu\u2019s eyes were vicious. He completely ignored Xiao Yan\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face was indifferent. His finger pressed onto Bing Fu once again without saying anything!</p><br/><p>Chi!</p><br/><p>White smoke rose and Bing Fu\u2019s entire body shook. His face had become unusually savage because of the intense pain.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly withdrew his finger and indifferently demanded, \u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bing Fu\u2019s breathing had become ragged. A moment later, he finally clenched his teeth and said with a hoarse voice, \u201cIce Zun Force is a unique Dou Qi of my Ice River Valley. One must reach the Dou Zong class in order to create it. If this Ice Zun Force enters one\u2019s body, it will quietly conceal itself and gradually freeze the blood and veins in one\u2019s body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can it be undone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no method to undo it unless you get the Valley Chief of my Ice River Valley to personally do it. However, I don\u2019t think that you are capable of that.\u201d Bing Fu let out a dense laugh.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes turned icy-cold. He ignored him and nodded slightly to Tian Huo zun-zhe. After which, he turned around and walked away. He had just taken a few steps when he heard a bone-cracking sound being emitted from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are their souls. Keep them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan grabbed the three jade bottles that shot over from behind him. He glanced at them and stored them in his Storage Ring. After which, he swiftly walked to the Little Fairy Doctor. He involuntarily felt his heart ache when he saw her pale-white face. He softly said, \u201cLet\u2019s leave this place first. I will think of a way to deal with the so-called Ice Zun Force.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor gently nodded. Her pretty eyes looked at the young man in front of her. Within less than a year, he seemed about to catch up with her\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan extended his arm, grabbed the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s tiny waist. After which, he got the Earth Demon Puppet to bring Xin Lan, who was hiding in one corner. His body moved and he swiftly rushed toward the deeper regions of the Fallen God Stream\u2026</p><br/><p>The surroundings of this mountain stream immediately became quiet after Xiao Yan\u2019s group left. Only the corpses and fresh blood all over the place gave an indication of the intense battle that had erupted at this spot earlier\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

At this rate, it is likely that all of it will completely disappear not long later.\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression on Su Qian\u2019s face became interesting after he had heard the result of an investigation by an Elder in the spacious hall. He clenched his teeth violently before becoming hopelessly depressed a moment later. His heart laughed bitterly. It was unexpected that the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was not snatched by someone else, but was actually directly refined by this fellow.</p><br/><p>The importance of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 toward the Inner Academy was naturally extremely great. Otherwise, it would not cause Su Qian and the rest to guard it with their lives. Now, however, with the disappearance of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019, its effect of raising one\u2019s training speed would also gradually weaken until it disappeared. In other words, there would no longer be much meaning to the existence of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019.</p><br/><p>Having lost the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019, the system of grooming strong people that the Inner Academy was proud of might well have been broken. The subsequent results would be extremely serious.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere was a little quiet in the hall. All the Elders were also helpless as they watched the despondent expression of the First Elder. Now that the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 had already been refined by Xiao Yan, they could not simply just ask him to spit it out no? It was still fine if Xiao Yan was an enemy. They could forcefully capture him and remove the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. However, the most troublesome thing was that this fellow had done quite a big favor for the Inner Academy. If Xiao Yan had not defeated those two Dou Huangs in the great battle two years ago, it was likely that the Inner Academy would have suffered severe losses in that fight.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was also somewhat embarrassed as he sensed the atmosphere in the hall. Honestly speaking, he still felt a little apologetic toward Su Qian. After all, he had had intentions toward the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 from the moment he had entered Jia Nan Academy. Although he appeared to have been a great help to the academy in that great battle, his hidden motive was to try his best to have a bigger chance of obtaining the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder, is there any other method to remedy the situation?\u201d Xiao Yan carefully inquired. It was somewhat impossible for him to hand over the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 now that things had developed to this point. However, he also felt somewhat uneasy if he simply just watched the Inner Academy suffer such a great loss.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, from the looks of things now, it seems that we can only use a man-made \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. Otherwise, the effects of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 will disappear completely.\u201d Su Qian was silent for a long time after hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words. Only then did he sigh and said helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cA man-made \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled. A \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 could actually be man-made?</p><br/><p>\u201cCreating this thing is not considered very difficult. Back then, the headmaster left behind a back-up \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 container before he had left. As long as one pours some \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 within it, it is still able to enable the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 to possess the effect of raising one\u2019s training speed. However, the effect will be a little worse than before.\u201d Su Qian looked at Xiao Yan before continuing, \u201cThis requires your help. Separate a little of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 and hand it to us. This should not be a problem right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan quietly sigh in relief when he heard this. The \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 had already been refined by him into an essence flame seed. As long as the Dou Qi in his body was not exhausted, it would be able to create an endless amount of it for use. Separating a little of it out may exhaust his Dou Qi, but he was already extremely satisfied that there was a method which achieved the best of both worlds.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, that kind of summoned \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 poses many limitations. Once my Dou Qi disappears, the flame will automatically disappear\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan could not help but speak with hesitation when he recalled this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe container was created personally by the headmaster. You need not be concerned about this type of problem. However, this container can only attain a delaying effect. Hence, it is likely that you must periodically come to the Inner Academy to help replenish the flame of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019...\u201d Su Qian mused out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeriodically returning to the Inner Academy?\u201d Xiao Yan was a little startled as he laughed bitterly, \u201cIs there an exact timeframe for this \u2018periodically\u2019? If I leave the Inner Academy in the future, I won\u2019t have to return to this place once every half a month or month right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is something that I\u2019m not very certain. However, as long as you leave enough flame for us to store, it should not be a problem maintaining it for one to two years.\u201d Su Qian thought for a moment before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan sighed and nodded with a smile, \u201cAlright, I\u2019ll do as First Elder recommends.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, brat, you got it cheap. It is really unexpected that the thing which Han Feng failed to obtain despite putting in so much effort was easily obtained by you. Our Inner Academy has protected it with great difficulty for so many years only to benefit you, little fellow.\u201d Su Qian rolled his eyes. His voice was somewhat sour as he spoke. He naturally understood the effect of the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 best. Xiao Yan had refined it. Therefore, his originally frightening training speed would likely soar greatly in the future. Such a temptation was extremely great to anyone.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled awkwardly before immediately knitting his brows together. He slowly asked, \u201c Han Feng\u2026 is currently still in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian narrowed his eyes. A faint cold glint flashed past them. He firmly remembered the matter of Han Feng gathering a large group of experts to attack the Inner Academy in his heart even now.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, that is even better. There are some matters that I should look for him to settle.\u201d Xiao Yan crossed his fingers and laughed. His smile emitted threads of dense coldness. That fellow had luckily escaped back then. Now that he was able to come out from that lifeless magma area, the first thing he needed to do was naturally finish off the matter with this \u2018Senior\u2019. Otherwise, how would he account to Yao Lao who was currently in a slumber.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough your strength has soared greatly. It is likely a little difficult to do so by yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian shook his head and voiced his thoughts, \u201cHan Feng has established a \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. Quite a number of relatively strong factions have joined it. Currently, the number of strong people in the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 are as numerous as the clouds. Even I have a never ending headache because of it. During the two years in which you were not around, the Inner Academy has gone to find trouble with those fellows a couple of times. However, most of them were blocked by the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBlack Alliance?\u201d Xiao Yan knit his brows. His finger gently knocked against the surface of the table. A moment later, he finally spoke, \u201cIn that case\u2026 does First Elder not want to get back at them?\u201d</p><br/><p>A fierce glint flashed across Su Qian\u2019s eyes as he spoke ferociously, \u201cWhy would I not want to? The Inner Academy\u2019s reputation cannot worsen in my hands. Otherwise, how will I account to the headmaster when he returns in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, that\u2019s good. First Elder, you should gather some people. We will head to the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 in three days!\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s finger paused before he stood up and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, since you are interested, our Inner Academy will join the fun!\u201d Su Qian\u2019s palm heavily slammed on the table as he also laughed out loud. Now that he had the participation of Xiao Yan, this extremely strong fellow, it was likely that they would be able to break the stalemate with the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 during these two years.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will gather all the helpers in three days. After that, it is time to completely end our conflict with the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d Su Qian appeared to have recalled something as he frowned a little. He looked at Xiao Yan and spoke, \u201cBefore this, I think that you should settle the conflict with that expert Dou Zong who has come and looked for trouble with you. Otherwise, if she comes and intervenes during that great battle\u2026 you should also be clearly aware just what kind of fighting strength a Dou Zong possesses. If she were to join the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019, we would suffer great losses even if our entire army isn\u2019t destroyed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe will definitely not join the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled as he observed Su Qian\u2019s stern face. He sighed, \u201cAlright, I will settle the problem with her first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you need our help?\u201d Su Qian hesitated for a moment before asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, relax. The presence of more people will not help the problem between her and me.\u201d Xiao Yan laughed bitterly as he cupped his hands toward Su Qian. He said, \u201cSince I have already accounted for most of the things, I should return first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian mused for a moment after seeing Xiao Yan turned around. After which, he slowly said, \u201cI think I should tell you something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Xiao Yan turned his head doubtfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour second brother is in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 right?\u201d Su Qian\u2019s voice had just sounded when he sensed the aura all over Xiao Yan suddenly rose. A pair of old eyes which were filled with surprise were raised as he watched the young man whose face had instantly become dark and cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat has happened to my second brother?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s voice was as cold as ice and void of any emotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrently, nothing has happened to him.\u201d Su Qian suppressed the surprise in his heart and widened his hands. He said, \u201cI have sent some people to quietly protect him after you had been dragged underground by the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. He was merely quietly training for the first half of the year. However, one year later he was chased into the deep mountains by some people who were after his life. It was two months later when he next appeared. At that time, his strength had suddenly and strangely soared to the Dou Wang class. I am not certain what happened to him in the deep mountains.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the information gathered, he has quietly established an extremely secretive organization within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. This organization currently has quite a strong reputation within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 because they purposefully pick members of the \u2018Black Alliance to kill\u2019. Moreover, they kill whoever they meet. Clearly, your second brother is taking revenge for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face recovered its calmness as he quietly nodded. It was good that nothing had happened to second brother.</p><br/><p>However, his expression had just calmed down when Su Qian\u2019s subsequent words caused it to become completely dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cDue to your second brother killing the members of the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 for a long time, he has aroused the anger of the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019. According to the information I got, it seems that a few factions who are quite strong have begun encircling your second brother and his organization. It is likely that his current condition is not very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the face of the black-robed young man was frighteningly dark and cold. It even contained a faint savageness. The icy-cold voice of his contained an incomparable amount of killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have my second older brother\u2019s location?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

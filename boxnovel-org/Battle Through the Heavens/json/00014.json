This is a monster core from a first level magic monster named Swallow Wood Fox. It is a high quality core! Our Sharp Teeth Mercenary Group waited 3 days and ambushed 5 Swallow Wood Foxes before finally obtaining this magic core\u2026\u201d Noticing Xiao Yan\u2019s luxurious outfit, the mercenary rapidly advertised his wares.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this object is to young master\u2019s liking, I think 500 gold coins would be a good price. Haha, while obtaining this core, we had several brothers who got injured quite heavily\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly wiped the remaining blood off of the magic core, noticing they haven\u2019t completely clotted yet. He nodded slightly and glanced towards the two golden stars on the chest of the mercenary and commented: \u201cToo expensive! Normally a level one magic core\u2019s price would only be from 400 to 450 gold coins, furthermore, even if the Swallow Wood Fox is a magic beast, its attack power isn\u2019t too high. Are your underlings not Dou Zhes?\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of his mouth slightly jerking, the mercenary laughed dryly. He did not expect the youth standing in front of him to be so knowledgeable about the magic core market and replied: \u201c470 gold coins then, no more no less, we have to live by this\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahh\u2026\u201d Sighing under the Mercenary\u2019s anxious eyes, Xiao Yan bent down and randomly grabbed many things from the stall, conveniently including the mysterious metal piece in the mess. Then he said: \u201c470 gold coins for all of these\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking at the goods on Xiao Yan\u2019s hands, the mercenary let out a relieved sigh since none of the items in Xiao Yan\u2019s hands were expensive\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright!\u201d</p><br/><p>Cheerfully producing some gold coins, Xiao Yan did not waste another moment and left immediately\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! Brat, to be so cautious in a mundane task of buying things!\u201d The elder\u2019s taunting voice sounded in Xiao Yan\u2019s head as he turned to leave the shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose bastards are all swindlers, they\u2019ll immediately increase the price if you show interest in their wares. I don\u2019t want to lose money for something stupid like that\u2026\u201d After answering, Xiao Yan stopped paying attention to the Elder inside his ring and leisurely exited the market and returned to the clan with Xun Er.</p><br/><p>After parting with Xun Er, Xiao Yan impatiently ran back to his room and carefully locked the door\u2026</p><br/><p>Turning his head and seeing the Elder who left the ring since god-knows-when, Xiao Yan brought out the recently purchased herbs and magic core. He hastily asked: \u201cAll the required ingredients are here, what do we have to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Elder cheerfully laughed and his gaze scanned the ingredients on the table before suddenly asking: \u201cDon\u2019t you want to know what that black metal piece is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEh?\u201d Xiao Yan paused before realizing that the elder was referring to his \u201caccidental\u201d purchase. He quickly took out the Black Metal Piece and examined it from top to bottom. But after examining it, his brows furrowed and asked: \u201cThis, what does it do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao took the Black Metal Piece and laughed: \u201cThere seems to be a Dou Technique inside here. And, the creator of this metal piece was probably also an alchemist because only people that have a strong soul perception can feel the power within this metal piece.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDou Technique?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes brightened and he hurriedly asked: \u201cWhat level is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the Dou Qi Mainland, the importance of Dou Techniques isn\u2019t lower than Qi Methods. A strong Dou Technique would allow one to perform at a level far beyond what they are capable of. For example, a Dou Zhe being able to fight a Dou Shi even though his Dou Qi is at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>Dou Techniques and Qi Methods are both split into four levels of decreasing power, Tian, Di, Xuan and Huang. Normally, the Dou Techniques that are easily accessible are at most High Huang level and for higher Dou Techniques, one would have to go to a large clan or faction.</p><br/><p>Of course, Dou Qi Mainland is huge and there are some special circumstances in which the top Dou Techniques are lost and found by some lucky individual. The black metal piece that Xiao Yan has right now was probably the lost work of some ancient person\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Lao turned the metal plate around and smiled: \u201cVacuum Hand : Low Xuan level!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLow Xuan level?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s face was filled with happiness; he didn\u2019t expect that the \u201ctrash\u201d he purchased would have a Xuan level Dou Technique. In his own clan, the Xiao Clan, the highest Dou Technique was only a Middle Xuan level and only the clan leader and some elders could learn it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cVacuum Hand: If trained to max, it can suck up boulders that are thousands of pound. Against enemies, it can forcibly suck the blood out of their body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cForcibly suck blood from a body?\u201d His face full of surprise, Xiao Yan swallowed dryly and exclaimed: \u201cThis\u2026 This is awesome! Once the blood leaves the body, they would die right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be happy yet. This only works if your level is higher than your opponent. If you meet someone stronger than you, they can use the chance to get close to you and the unlucky would be you\u2026\u201d Yao Lao carelessly threw the metal plate to the side, looks like he doesn\u2019t think too highly of the Dou Technique.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao was of high status and naturally had high standards but for Xiao Yan, this was a high level Dou Technique! He immediately happily picked it up and laughed: \u201cEven with that, it\u2019s better than the Dou Techniques in the clan. I\u2019ll learn this from now on\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHah, with your 3rd Duan Qi, it would be amazing if you could pull up a tree branch with your Vacuum Hand and you want to suck the blood out of someone\u2026.\u201d Shaking his head, Yao Lao heavily criticized Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Rolling his eyes, Xiao Yan ignored Yao Lao and smiled while hugging the metal piece.</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at yourself, having a Low Xuan Dou Technique makes you this happy. You\u2019re embarrassing me \u2026\u201d Helplessly shaking his head, Yao Lao grabbed the monster core on the table and ordered Xiao Yan: \u201cGo get a huge bowl of water.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Yao Lao was about to start refining the pill, Xiao Yan hurriedly put away the Black Metal Piece and cheerfully went to prepare\u2026</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>In the calm room, Yao Lao picked up the Purple Bluegrass with his left hand. Moments later, he lets out a deep breath and a white flame appears in his hand\u2026</p><br/><p>When the flame appeared, the temperature within the room rose exponentially.</p><br/><p>Without blinking, Xiao Yan stared at the white ball of flame. Although he didn\u2019t know the process of refining pills by Alchemists, to materialize Dou Qi was an impossible task for even his father\u2026</p><br/><p>With a calm face, the white fire in Yao Lao\u2019s hands expanded and swallowed the Purple Bluegrass\u2026. Within the flame, the Purple Bluegrass instantly became a green liquid ball\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s right hand picked up another stalk of Purple Bluegrass and threw it into the white fire\u2026</p><br/><p>After throwing all three stalks of Purple Bluegrass into the fire, the ball of green liquid became visibly bigger.</p><br/><p>The green liquid slowly shriveled within the fire; the high temperature relentlessly burned the impurities within the green liquid\u2026</p><br/><p>With the flame, the green liquid became smaller and smaller in volume. After a few seconds, it was only about the size of a thumb\u2026</p><br/><p>Afterwards, Yao Lao threw the two stalks of Bone Washing Flowers into the flame and after they finished burning, the remaining liquid mixed with the original green liquid\u2026</p><br/><p>After that was the refinement of the monster core.</p><br/><p>The third step took a whole hour but Yao Lao still seemed full of energy and without any signs of fatigue.</p><br/><p>After an entire hour, the tough monster core had become a ball of green liquid. The violent energy within the monster core was softened by Yao Lao\u2019s magical formula\u2026</p><br/><p>On his hand, the white flame slowly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Looking at the green ball floating on top of Yao Lao\u2019s hand, Xiao Yao rubbed his hands together. With his superior Soul Perception, he could clearly feel the bountiful energy within the energy ball\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher, do I just eat it?\u201d Xiao Yan blinked his eyes and asked impatiently.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to die then eat it. With your Qi paths, you would become a true cripple within seconds.\u201d Giving Xiao Yan a white eye, Yao Lao flicks the ball and it accurately flew into the bowl of water. Immediately, the bowl of clear water turned to a dark green shade.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, you should train in there. With your talent and barring any unforeseen circumstances, you should be able to get to 7 Duan Qi within a year.\u201d Yao Lao claps the dust off of his hands and lightly smiles towards Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>With obvious happiness, Xiao Yan hurriedly nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I almost forgot. This medicine will only last for two months. Which means, you need to go buy the materials that you got today again every two months.\u201d Yao Lao revealed a sly smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan happiness disappeared from his face and he nodded his head with reluctance.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, only rich people can afford to use this stuff\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He waved to the white dressed lady gracefully standing on the eagle\u2019s back and shouted with a smile, \u201cFairy Doctor, we\u2019ll part here. We\u2019ll meet again if we are destined to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake care, Xiao Yan!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Fairy Doctor lowered her head and stared at the young man on the mountain with a smile. The smile contained some sorrow but after she waved her hand, she did not linger. She directed the Blue Eagle and adjusted her body before flying toward the western sky amidst a clear eagle cry.</p><br/><p>Standing at the mountain peak, Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze continued to send that faint blue shadow off until it disappeared into the horizon. After which, he took in a gradual breath. After this parting of ways, it was difficult to tell just how long they needed to wait before they would see each other again. Moreover, when they did see each other again, maybe everything between them had changed drastically.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face was a little lonely. A moment later, however, Xiao Yan shook his head and abandoned his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stood on the peak for a long time, waiting for his emotions to calm down before he turned around and walked towards the base of the mountain with the large Heavy Xuan Ruler on his back.</p><br/><p>The place where Xiao Yan was currently at was not within the boundary of Qingshan Town. After all, these small towns were not rare near the Magic Beast Mountain Range.</p><br/><p>The city that was currently located closest to Xiao Yan was a huge city situated in the eastern province of the Jia Ma Empire. Its size was much more majestic compared to Wu Tan City. If one were to discuss its military strength, this city was among the strongest when compared with all of the large cities within the Jia Ma Empire.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan currently planned to first hurry to Black Rock City. This was because only such large sized cities would be allocated a Flying Transportation Fleet by the empire for the commoner\u2019s use. After all, the Magic Beast Mountain Rage and the eastern border were too far apart. If Xiao Yan were to walk over, he might need at least four to five months. However, Xiao Yan currently did not have time to squander. Thus, he must head to Black Rock City to take one of the Flying Transportation Fleets toward the border of the empire.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xiao Yan could also directly use the Purple Cloud Wings to fly there. However, even with his recent promotion to the Dou Shi level, it was a little impossible for him to pass through over half of the Jia Ma Empire.</p><br/><p>Moreover, it would be far too easy to be noticed by people if he used the Purple Cloud Wings to fly. With the Jia Ma Empire being so vast, there were many strong people hiding within it; he did not want to get himself into unnecessary trouble. The reason for avoiding trouble was that it was far too time consuming. As he had said earlier, the thing that he was in need of the most was time.</p><br/><p>After descending from the peak, Xiao Yan arrived at a small town. He rested for awhile before hiring the fastest carriage available and at the fastest speed, rushed toward Black Rock City without stopping.</p><br/><p>Although this town was the closest to Black Rock City, the horse carriage took most of the afternoon before Xiao Yan could faintly see the city\u2019s huge outline.</p><br/><p>Standing on the horse carriage, Xiao Yan watched the huge city that was reflecting a dim reddish light under the setting sun and let out a faint sigh.</p><br/><p>As the horse carriage grew closer, Xiao Yan realized that the enormous city walls were actually built from numerous blocks of neatly arranged Black Rock. According to the old driver of the horse carriage, the city walls had withstood the a smashing attack from the combined strength of two Dou Wang without shaking. From this, it could be understood just how strong the defense of the walls were.</p><br/><p>After paying the taxes for the horse carriage at the city\u2019s gate, it was successfully let in. The horse carriage passed through a dark tunnel through the city wall. A moment later, Xiao Yan\u2019s sight was open and clear while the noisy sound of people\u2019s voices came pouring into Xiao Yan ears from all directions. Being unprepared, Xiao Yan\u2019s head swelled slightly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s head was a little giddy as he walked out of the carriage under the smiling gaze of the old man. He paid the fare and watched the horse carriage scattering about as it left. Standing blankly on a street, Xiao Yan observed the surrounding jumble of the crowd. Having been used to the quietness of the valley, Xiao Yan suddenly found that he did not know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, find a place for the night. I\u2019m not sure if this Black Rock City has any Alchemist Association. If there is, it would be best to go and take the test and see if you can achieve a tier two grade.\u201d Yao Lao voice suddenly sounded in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo to the Alchemist Association?\u201d Xiao Yan stilled as he asked in a stunned voice, \u201cWon\u2019t that mean that I would expose my identity as an alchemist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d Hearing this Yao Lao was a little speechless. After a long while, he said in a manner that suggested he did not know whether to laugh or cry, \u201cI never told you to hide your identity as an alchemist, right? You\u2019re the one who\u2019s been trying to hide. I know that you like to keep a low profile but you should know that the most frightening thing of an alchemist is not just that they can make medicinal pills. Rather, it is that they have and create an enormous network. After all, there are many strong people who required medicinal pills. When they need these pills, they need to get an alchemist to help them. Once the strong people owe the alchemists favors, won\u2019t these strong people be the best fighters when the alchemists meet any trouble in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, there was a time where someone came to seek revenge on me. The other side had a Dou Zhong, three Dou Huangs and five Dou Wangs\u2026 Do you want to know what happened next?\u201d Yao Lao said with a smile as he suddenly paused at this point.</p><br/><p>With the most important portion being severed off, Xiao Yan could only helplessly shake his head and ask, \u201cWhat happened next?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter that I used spiritual communication. Uh, this is something you will know in the future. What happened next\u2026 Three Dou Zhongs, Eight Dou Huangs, Twelve Dou Wangs and Eighteen Dou Lings along with others that I cannot remember came. The result, I believe, you should be able to imagine.\u201d Yao Lao, who was full of smiles, replied.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s steps suddenly froze. He slowly lifted his head and took in a breath of cool air. Three Dou Zhongs, eight Dou Huangs, twelve Dou Wangs\u2026 this kind of frightening line-up should have no problem destroying even an entire empire. Did alchemists really possesses such an enormous power?</p><br/><p>\u201cAh. So, it does not hurt if you occasionally reveal your identity as an alchemist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that there\u2019s some logic to it. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll go to the Alchemist Association to test if I can be promoted to a tier two alchemist.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was still a little dazzled as he scratched his head. However, he soon nodded his head and accepted it. Xiao Yan was not the type to be begging for favors so if he had the opportunity to let a strong person owe him a favor, he would naturally grab the chance. If there was no such chance, it was not something to be anxious about.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, additionally, if you have the time, go and take a look at the auction house here. If there\u2019s a rank three Monster Core, try your best to purchase it.\u201d Yao Lao voiced his thoughts once more, \u201cAlthough we have not found any type of Heavenly Flame, we still ought to perform all of the preparation steps. Otherwise, if you luckily found one, you might well have to abandon the extremely rare chance of consuming it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA rank three Monster Core? That is the last ingredient needed for refining the \u2018Blood Lotus Pill\u2019, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Xiao Yan asked as he slowly walked down the street. His gaze was randomly sweeping over the surrounding shops.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. If you want to swallow the Heavenly Flame, you will need the help of at least three indispensable things. The \u2018Blood Lotus Pill\u2019 is one of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Blood Lotus Pill\u2019 is an essential thing that allows you to come into close contact with a Heavenly Flame. Without its protection, even a Dou Huang would not dare to simply come into contact with a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, much less a small Dou Shi like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019. If the \u2018Blood Lotus Pill\u2019 is meant to protect the exterior of your body, then this \u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019 is meant to protect the inside of your body. It can protect you from the destructive temperature of a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 when you are refining it, preventing you from being burnt till nothing remains.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe last item is known as Acceptance Soul. This thing can create a special space in your body which is used to store a Heavenly Flame. After all, if you have not completely refined the flame, the kind of destructive ability of a Heavenly Flame would incinerate everything, including your vortex and body, except this kind of space of nothingness.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, an Acceptance Soul is very rare. I heard that it also has some relationship with the storage rings. An Acceptance Soul can only be found at the center of the highest grade Storage Stone which makes Storage Rings. You should know that the highest grade Storage Stone is the essential raw material in smelting a high-grade storage ring, so its rarity can be imagined. The presence of an Acceptance Soul in a high-grade Acceptance Stone is not very high. Ah\u2026 now you should know the extent of the rarity of an Acceptance Soul.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan opened his mouth, his face was lifeless. A long while later, he bitterly laughed and shook his head, \u201cThe Ice Spirit Cold Fountain and the Acceptance Soul are two things that I have never even heard of. Where do you want me to go to look for it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need not worry too much about the Acceptance Soul. Back then, when I was searching for a Heavenly Flame, I coincidentally prepared a little bit extra. Hence, the only thing that you lack is the Ice Spirit Cold Fountain and the rank three Monster Core.\u201d Yao Lao replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere can I find the Ice Spirit Cold Fountain?\u201d Xiao Yan asked while laughing drily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn extremely cold place or an extremely hot place\u2026\u201d Yao Lao answered with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is also present in an extremely hot place? Things go into reverse when pushed to the extreme?\u201d Xiao Yan blinked his eyes and asked in a surprised voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is precisely this theory.\u201d Yao Lao nodded his head. He then continued while smiling, \u201cOf course, if you are lucky enough, you may be able to get it from someone else\u2019s hands or the auction house. But I think that the chances aren\u2019t that great. After all, as long as someone has a bit of a decent knowledge, they would know that that thing is extremely rare. Normally, they would not easily take it out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we fail to prepare all these\u2026 but we luckily meet a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, what do we do?\u201d Xiao Yan rolled his eyes as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen we run. Abandon the chance, regardless of how hard it is to come by. Without these three essential things, you will die if you touch the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019!\u201d Yao Lao said blandly without the slightest hesitation in his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t there any substitutes?\u201d Xiao Yan asked in a dissatisfied voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are. However, these three things are selected by me as the most suitable support items when refining the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 after countless of experiments. To bluntly put it, if you were to say that you have a preparation method that would greatly increase the chances of success in refining a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, numerous alchemists would spend a shocking sum in order to obtain it!\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s voice contained a little pride. It appeared that these three items had really involved a lot of effort on his part.</p><br/><p>Shaking his head as he smiled bitterly, Xiao Yan\u2019s footsteps paused outside a spacious and luxurious hotel. He sighed, \u201cAlright, I will try my best to get the rank three Monster Core and the Ice Spirit Cold Fountain. However, whether I can get hold of them is something I\u2019m not certain of.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, we should go and rest for the night. After visiting the Alchemist Association tomorrow, we should go and stop by at the auction house. Hopefully, we will not be disappointed.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

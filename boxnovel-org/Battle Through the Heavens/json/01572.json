The expressions of all the Elders from the Yao clan turned gloomy at that instant. A cold glow flashed within their eyes.</p><br/><p>Each of the eight ancient clans had one part of the Tou She Ancient God Jade respectively. All of the clans treated it as a great treasure and kept it safe. Even an ordinary Elder would not be able to see it. This matter might not appear unusual in the eyes of those who were unaware of it but those who did looked at Hun Huzi as though they were watching a lunatic. How would it be possible for the Yao clan to loan such a treasure to him? Could it be that this person had gone crazy?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan knitted his brow tightly as he looked at Hun Huzi. The strange smile on the latter\u2019s face caused him to feel that something was not quite right. Uttering such words to the Yao clan was undoubtedly challenging the prestige of the Yao clan.Given this fellow\u2019s tier 6 Dou Sheng class strength, it was impossible for him to escape from the hands of Yao Dan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething is not quite right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s many years of experience had also allowed him to become extremely sensitive. He felt that something was not quite right. This Hun Huzi was not a fool. He should understand just what kind of treatment he would receive from the Yao clan by uttering such words. Yet\u2026 he was unafraid.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart involuntarily sunk slightly after he thought of this. His body moved and he appeared beside Yao Lao. His expression was grave as he softly said, \u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao also nodded gravely. He could sense that this Hun Huzi was a little strange.</p><br/><p>Elder Wanhuo\u2019s expression was dark and solemn as he stood in the sky. His eyes were filled with murderous intent as he looked at Hun Huzi. Once Yao Dan give the order, he would immediately attack with all his strength and kill this person, who dared to challenge the prestige of the Yao clan in front of so many people.</p><br/><p>\u201cHun Huzi, do you know what you are saying?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Dan looked at Hun Huzi in the sky from his leader\u2019s seat without any expression. However, there was a sharp chill flashing over his eyes. His voice did not contain any emotions as it was slowly emitted from within his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, clan head Yao Dan, the Tou She Ancient God Jade is something that brings disaster. It will only bring a calamity to you if it remains in the Yao clan. Handing it to me in exchange for your safety might be a little better, right?\u201d Hun Huzi laughed. It was as though he did not feel the murderous intent surging within Yao Dan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHun Huzi, you are acting too fearlessly. Today, I will first capture you and get the clan head of your Hun clan to come and bring you back!\u201d</p><br/><p>The expressions of Elder Wanhuo turned completely gloomy as Hun Huzi\u2019s words sounded. A furious cry sounded. Vast and mighty Dou Qi suddenly swept out in all directions. His body flashed and he appeared above Hun Huzi\u2019s head. A large flame wind gathered into a huge palm as it ruthlessly smashed towards the latter.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is almost time\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Huzi merely smiled faintly in the face of the ferocious attack from Elder Wanhuo. He lifted his head and looked at the distant sky before muttering to himself. Immediately, a strange grin appeared on the corner of his mouth. The black flame deep within his eyes surged out wildly like a furious dragon, which had been suppressed for a long time. After the black flame surged, Hun Huzi\u2019s aura also soared suddenly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hun Huzi waved his sleeve as he stood in the sky. That ordinary palm collided with the enormous wind flame palm. After which, everyone were shocked to find that the wind flame palm was completely devoured into Hun Huzi\u2019s upon contact. On the other hand, that Elder Wanhuo, who had a shocking aura, seemed to have suffered from a serious blow. A mouthful of fresh blood was spat out and his body flew backwards. Finally, it landed miserably onto the stadium below, smashing and forming a huge deep pit in the process.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, I have accompanied all of you to play for such a long time. Just treat this as some interest\u2026\u201d Hun Huzi\u2019s long air fluttered in the absence of any wind as he stood in the sky. Both of his eyes had already been completely covered by a black flame, giving him an exceptionally strange appearance. His faint voice resounded over the entire stadium as this occurred.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven star Dou Sheng!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expression had changed drastically at this moment. They looked at Hun Huzi in the sky with disbelief. The aura that the latter had emitted earlier had far surpassed Elder Wanhuo!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow has actually been hiding his strength. Don\u2019t tell me that he really intends to snatch the ancient jade of the Yao clan?\u201d Yao Lao softly said. His expression changed as he watched this scene.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression had become extremely grave at this moment. Both of his eyes stared intently at Hun Huzi. Since the very beginning, he actually failed to discover that this person was hiding his strength!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven in his fury from having the embryonic pill being snatched away, he was actually able to suppress his strength. This fellow is really scheming\u2026 however, could it be that he really wish to snatch the ancient jade from the Yao clan with just his strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Dan\u2019s expression had finally turned completely dark and cold as he stood on the leader\u2019s seat. He slowly stood up and stared intently at Hun Huzi. He spoke in a dense voice, \u201cSend the signal. Inform the Yan clan and the Lei clan. Tell them\u2026 we have found the perpetrator responsible for the disappearance of the Ling and Shi clan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone had a change in expression after Yao Dan\u2019s words sounded. Even Xiao Yan\u2019s body trembled suddenly. They lifted their heads and looked at Hun Huzi in a shocked manner. It was really\u2026 done by the Hun clan?</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although those Yao clan\u2019s Elders trembled after being frightened by Yao Dan\u2019s words, they still quickly took out a scroll and swiftly opened it. A spatial fluctuation quickly spread.</p><br/><p>However, these spatial fluctuation was about to agglomerate into a spatial tunnel when it seemed to have to disturbed by something. Immediately, it shook intensely. The tunnel, which had just been formed, disappeared in an instant.</p><br/><p>Many people in the Yao clan felt their hearts turn cold upon seeing this scene. Some of the Elders were quick to react and hurriedly let out the emergency siren within the clan. Immediately,a commotion broke out in the neighbouring mountain range had. Densely packed Yao clan\u2019s warriors hurriedly broke through the air and arrived like a swarm of locust.</p><br/><p>\u201cHun Huzi, what have you done?\u201d An Elder of the Yao clan cried out in a stern voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, it looks it it is completed\u2026\u201d Hun Huzi smiled slightly while standing in the sky. He did not even give those Yao clan\u2019s warriors, who had hurried over, another glance as he spoke casually, \u201cNothing. I have merely locked the Yao clan\u2019s realm\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A commotion was stirred below after these words sounded. Those various experts, who had come to observe the Medicinal Ceremony, had a drastic change in expression. They took out their spatial scroll and quickly tore it apart. However, the result was exactly the same as what had happened earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething big is about to happen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of cool air. His expression had become unprecedentedly ugly. He did not expect that the Hun clan\u2019s target would actually be the Yao clan. Moreover, no one had expected that they would come when the Yao clan was holding the Medicinal Ceremony!</p><br/><p>Yao Dan\u2019s expression was gloomy. His finger pressed on a Storage Ring and directly shattered it into dust. The ring could specially transfer the fluctuation to the Yan clan\u2019s and the Lei clan\u2019s heads. Only the three clan heads could possess it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, clan head Yao Dan, there is no need to waste your effort\u2026\u201d Hun Huzi laughed.</p><br/><p>Yao Dan ignored his words. His eyes stared at his finger and indeed saw that the fluctuation, which had appeared at that spot, had begun to randomly roam around like a headless housefly. Clearly, it could not be transmitted out of this place.</p><br/><p>Yao Dan\u2019s heart had completely sunk upon seeing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cHun Huzi, my Yao clan and the Yan clan has already built a spatial tunnel. If they discover that the tunnel has vanished, they will definitely know that something has happened to my Yao clan. The Gu clan will definitely not sit back idly and watch when news spread. If our four clans were to join hands, your Hun clan will definitely be destroyed!\u201d Yao Dan\u2019s heart might have sunk but he was after all the head of a clan. He immediately recovered his calmness and spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Hun clan is able to eliminate the Ling and Shi clan without the Gu clan detecting anything. Naturally, we can also let your Yao clan quietly vaporize from this world\u2026\u201dHun Huzi spoke in a faint voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith just you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Dan\u2019s body slowly rose into the sky. The frightening aura of a seven star Dou Sheng erupted without being held back. That powerful pressure was actually even stronger than that Hun Huzi. This strength was indeed worthy of the head of a clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Hun Huzi, this is a matter between your Hun clan and Yao clan. It has nothing to do with us. I hope that you will show mercy and allow us to leave. We will definitely repay you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those many chiefs and Elders from the various sects, who had come to observe the Medicinal Ceremony, hurriedly cried out respectfully when Yao Dan rose to the sky. At this moment, they had also felt some panic. The previous example of how the Shi and Ling clans were completely wiped off allowed them to understand that they would definitely die if they were to be dragged into this matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, that is only naturally. Those who are not from the Yao clan can leave. I will not stop you\u2026\u201d Hun Huzi smiled warmly and said after hearing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you elder!\u201d</p><br/><p>Many people from the various sects rejoiced upon seeing this. They did not dare to utter any unnecessary words as they turned around and rushed towards the entry to the Yao realm with all their strength.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan looked at the backs of these people and frowned slightly. Having dealt with the Hun clan many times before, Xiao Yan naturally understood just how ruthless these people were. It was clearly impossible for them to allow anyone to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha!\u201d</p><br/><p>This thought had only just flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s heart when countless of black light flashed over the distant horizon. Miserable cries immediately sounded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowl howl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone were shocked to see an endless black flame seeping out from the emptiness while the black light flashed in the distance. Finally, it spread in all directions and covered this entire place. Everything became dark almost instantly\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 the genuine Nihility Devouring Flame!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan looked at the black flame seeping out from within the emptiness. His eyes suddenly shrunk. Little Yi had also opened its eyes within his body. That tender little face was unusually grave. Clearly, even it had sensed an intense danger\u2026</p><br/><p>Hun Huzi was suspended in the sky. There was a monstrous black flame behind him. He smilingly lowered his head and looked at Yao Dan. Both of his arms were slowly widened. The smile on his face became increasingly strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Dan, I am honoured to announce to you that the Yao clan is finished\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His figure turned and transformed into a ray of light that rushed to the distant sky. Xiao Yan\u2019s flying speed was very quick. Currently, Xiao Yan was no longer stingy with his strength. Instead, the thing he was about to do was the first problem he needed to consider.</p><br/><p>After flying for nearly a few hundred kilometers, Xiao Yan\u2019s body suddenly shook. That majestic aura that permeated his body immediately scattered in a swift manner, appearing like a sponge losing water.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime\u2019s up\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily laughed as he sensed the swiftly weakening strength of his body. It seemed that he really needed to strengthen himself. His gaze swept in all directions before his body moved and landed on a mountain peak below with strange rock ruins.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe strength that you displayed this time around is too fierce. This has resulted in some injuries appearing in your body. You should quickly recuperate. Otherwise, a sequelae might be left behind. Moreover, you should use my Spiritual Strength as little as possible unless it is a critical moment. During these few days, I have discovered that each time you use my Spiritual Strength, a remnant spirit of mine is left within your body. If too much of these things exist, it is likely they will cause your body to form a resistance to your soul. At that time, your soul will not be able to merge perfectly with your physical body and it would be too late for you to cry.\u201d Tian Huo zun-zhe\u2019s somewhat solemn voice was emitted after Xiao Yan landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression involuntarily changed when he heard this. He also vaguely felt such a feeling during this period of time. However, he did not think too much of it. After all, such a situation did not occur when he had borrowed Yao Lao\u2019s Spiritual Strength back then.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan was uncertain what had happened, he still nodded his head. Tian Huo zun-zhe would not harm him. Since the latter had said this, it was naturally not some alarmist words.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeems like this act of borrowing the strength of others possesses a great possibility of a sequela. I should be a little more careful in the future\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan softly exhaled while quietly speaking in his heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan remembered this matter within his heart. His gaze swept around him before his body moved and appeared on the steep mountain wall beside the mountain peak. He swung his heavy ruler. Rock fragments flew like bean curds being cut. Finally, he created a small cave which could allow a person to stay in. Currently, the most important thing was to heal the injuries within his body. He might have sent the Wind Lightning Pavilion scattering this time around, but it was likely that they would not just leave things be. However, Xiao Yan was also unafraid of them. The Central Plains were huge. Just this northern region was already vast and endless. Even if the Wind Lightning Pavilion was considered a great strength, it was not as though there were no factions who could fight with it in this northern region. Once Xiao Yan left the territory where its strength was concentrated, they would naturally be unable to do anything to him.</p><br/><p>It was likely that once was enough when it came to something like using the Han clan to threaten him. Other people knew that Xiao Yan did not have a deep relationship with the Han clan. It was likely that the Wind Lightning Pavilion would not be so foolish as to pull the same trick a second time. After all, if they did it a second time, they would not only be badmouthed, but the Han clan would likely really become crazy. Even an anxious rabbit knew how to bite someone, much less the Han clan who possessed some face within the Tian Bei City.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s body moved as these thoughts flashed through his heart. After which, he entered the cave and swiftly sat down. He took out a medicinal pill from his Storage Ring, stuffed it into his mouth, and formed the training seal with both his hands. He slowly descended into a state of recuperation.</p><br/><p>The recuperation of Xiao Yan took a total of three days this time around. During these three days, he searched all over his body and did indeed sense some extremely faint remnant spiritual imprints. The existence of these remnant auras was so faint that they were negligible. However, they were able to burrow deep into one\u2019s body. Fortunately, there was only a few remnant spiritual auras. Otherwise, the effects would be extremely serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed\u2026 this thing is really troublesome\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also laughed bitterly and sighed upon discovering these remnant spiritual imprints. Moreover, when he tried and failed to use Dou Qi or even the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 in an attempt to remove them, his bitter smile became even denser. Fortunately, Xiao Yan had discovered this thing quite early. Otherwise, if there even more spiritual imprints had gathered in the future, it was likely that he could only leave the body he had been born with and turn into a spiritual body similar to Tian Huo zun-zhe.</p><br/><p>Although there was only a few of these spiritual imprints, it was still a source of trouble, Given Xiao Yan\u2019s character, he was naturally unable to endure the existence of this kind of troublesome existence remaining hidden within his body. However, after having tried various methods that all failed, he could only helplessly give up.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had kept his eyes shut while he remained in the mountain cave. His eyes were slowly opened and his aura had once again returned to its peak condition. Powerful Dou Qi rippled over his fingers when he raised his hand. A nine star Dou Huang was indeed much stronger than a seven star.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese remnant spiritual imprints might be troublesome, but they are not impossible to remove. I remember that there seemed to be some medicinal pills which could get rid of them\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan opened his eyes as he softly muttered. His finger gently touched the dark-black Storage Ring Yao Lao had left behind. His Spiritual Strength entered it. Inside were the many Medicinal Formulae that Yao Lao had collected over his lifetime. This was a treasure that Yao Lao had left to Xiao Yan. From a certain point of view, it was even more precious than the Bone Chilling Flame\u2026</p><br/><p>If these Medicinal Formulae did not exist, Xiao Yan\u2019s alchemist journey would definitely have been much slower. From this, one could tell how important it was.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan searched for nearly an hour. Finally, he, whose body was completely still, opened his eyes in an abrupt manner. A joy was revealed within his eyes. With a swing of his hand, an ancient, black-colored scroll appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoul Cleansing Pill, a peak level tier 6 medicinal pill. It is able to clean the body of all the Spiritual Strength that doesn\u2019t belong to it. Moreover, it also possesses the effect of nourishing one\u2019s Spiritual Strength. The ingredients needed to refine it are, Body Cleansing Grass, Ice Fire Soul Merger Fruit, Water Spirit Lotus Seed...:\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s Spiritual Strength entered the scroll and imprinted all of the information in the medicinal formula into his mind. By the time he got to the effects of the Soul Cleansing Pill, the smile on his face had already become a lot denser.</p><br/><p>\u201cPeak of the tier 6 level. It is of a high tier. However, I should be able to refine it. The medicinal ingredients might be a little unorthodox and rare, but I might be able to get ahold of them if I inquire a little. The remnant spiritual imprints in my body have difficulty accomplishing much. There is still sufficient time\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan carefully read the medicinal formula before he muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief after he found a method to resolve the problem. He placed the medicinal formula within his Storage Ring, mused for a moment before beckoning with his hand. Four silver-colored scrolls appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>The scrolls were bright in color. Countless blood-vein-like traces spread around them. At a glance, they possessed a mysterious feeling. These four scrolls were naturally obtained from the hands of the four Elders from the Wind Lightning Northern Pavilion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is likely that these three should be the other portions of the \u2018Three Thousand Lightning Illusionary Body\u2019\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan flicked his finger and summoned the Earth Demon Puppet. After which, he tossed the scrolls over. The puppet immediately caught them and opened them as ordered.</p><br/><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><br/><p>As Xiao Yan had anticipated, the interior of the scrolls hid a fierce strength. Looking at the Earth Demon Puppet, which had been sent flying until it formed a ten-foot-large dent on the wall, Xiao Yan involuntarily laughed, \u201cThese people from the Wind Lightning Pavilion are all so insidious\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan beckoned with his hand and the three silver-colored scrolls were pulled back. His Spiritual Strength swiftly entered one of them.</p><br/><p>Following the entry of his Spiritual Strength, the space within the scroll was similar to that within Chen Yun\u2019s scroll. The area below was a lightning pool filled with electric arcs. Xiao Yan familiarly erased the thunderbolt that had been created from Spiritual Strength. Finally, mysterious lightning words appeared on the clear lake\u2019s surface.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan carefully remembered all these words in his mind. Finally, his Spiritual Strength was withdrawn and entered the third scroll followed by the fourth\u2026</p><br/><p>Around half an hour or so later, Xiao Yan\u2019s Spiritual Strength slowly withdrew from the fourth scroll. He immediately shut his eyes and arranged the mysterious lightning words that seemed to possess a life of their own.</p><br/><p>After arranging them for ten minutes, Xiao Yan once again opened his eyes. His brows were immediately knit together. The four scrolls lightning words seemed to have formed a complete version after merging together. However, for some unknown reason, Xiao Yan had difficulty obtaining the so-called training method from them.</p><br/><p>This kind of feeling was as though one had obtained a treasure chest, but lacked a key to it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKey\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan softly muttered in his mouth. A moment later, he suddenly tightened his hand. That\u2019s right. He did indeed lack a key that could transform these mysterious lightning words into a training method. However, he was also unaware of what exactly this key was. It was likely that only those people from the Wind Lightning Pavilion, who were qualified to practice it, were aware of it. However, it was clear that the other party would never inform him about such a secret.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, this damn thing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan violently clenched his teeth and involuntarily cursed. After spending such a great amount of effort, he ended up with a Di Class High Level Dou Skill he could only look at but not practice. This caused his heart to itch. It was really torture.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis broken thing is so troublesome. Once the old me obtains the Three Thousand Burning Flame, I will attack your Wind Lightning Pavilion and get you to hand over the training method\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan cursed indignantly as he returned the scroll to his Storage Ring, feeling extremely helpless as he did so.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can only place this thing temporarily aside. Now that I have offended the Wind Lightning Pavilion, it is likely that I can only choose to go into hiding first. I should find a city with a Wormhole and leave this area. The northern region is so large. Even the Wind Lightning pavilion will not be able to intervene\u2026 once I have left the Wind Lightning Pavilion\u2019s area of influence, I will quickly find the ingredients to help Tian Huo zun-zhe refine a body. He would definitely be a great help. Moreover, I should also think of a way to quickly breakthrough the Dou Huang class and advance to the Dou Zong classl. It would be best if this occurs before the Pill Gathering begins\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stood up, returned the Earth Demon Puppet into his Storage Ring, and muttered to himself.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

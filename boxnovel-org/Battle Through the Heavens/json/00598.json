Many experts were startled when they saw the source of the aura. Upon seeing Fan Lao who was facing the source on the opposite side, their expression became different. The faces of those who regarded Han Feng as the leader immediately became ugly. At this moment when they were evenly matched, the impact an elite Dou Huang possessed was quite great. One could even say that it could decide the final victor...</p><br/><p>Su Qian, Hu Gan, and the other experts within the Inner Academy may be stunned at Xiao Yan who had suddenly erupted, but the majority of their feelings were of joy\u2026 At this moment, Xiao Yan was undoubtedly a reinforcement who had made an extremely timely appearance. With his help, their side of the battleground would be able to have at least one less expert Dou Huang. This would undoubtedly greatly reduce the pressure that the Elders faced.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little brat\u2026 indeed held something back. I just knew that it was impossible that he did not possess a true trump card after being able to force the Misty Cloud Sect into that manner.\u201d Hu Gan eyed the aura emitted by Xiao Yan, which was not at all weaker than him. His heart involuntarily let out praise before he immediately gazed toward the frowning Han Feng on the opposite side. He could not help but laughed coldly, \u201cHan Feng, you better pray that the Headmaster will not return within a short period of time. Otherwise\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly as he spoke in a faint voice, \u201cA natural and unique treasure like the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is something that a destined person should possess. This kind of sealing method of your Inner Academy is somewhat against the rules.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen it is within the rules to give it to you alchemists to refine it?\u201d Hu Gan ridiculed.</p><br/><p>Han Feng knit his brows, but did not continue the meaningless argument. While he was facing off against Hu Gan, his gaze was repeatedly thrown in the direction where Xiao Yan was. For some unknown reason, he repeatedly sensed a very strange feeling coming from this young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis feeling\u2026 why is it such a familiar feeling?\u201d Han Feng muttered in his heart. He thought about it bitterly to no avail and could only throw his gaze toward the battle circle where Su Qian and the Gold Silver Brothers were at. As the three strongest people present, there was no sign of anyone else within a hundred meters of their battleground. The remnant waves of such a fight at such a level was something that even a Dou Huang expert like them did not dare to easily ignore.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Gold Silver Brothers may be able to fight with an elite Dou Zong after joining hands, however, it was clearly impossible for them to defeat Su Qian. As more time passed, they would gradually end up in a disadvantaged situation. There might be quite a bit of trouble if Su Qian was allowed to divert his attention at that time. Looks like I need to quickly escape.\u201d A thought swiftly ran through Han Feng\u2019s heart, and his gaze gradually became cold a moment later. He flipped his hands and a deep-blue flame suddenly rose from his palm.</p><br/><p>Hu Gan\u2019s expression became much more serious upon seeing the writhing deep-blue flame in Han Feng\u2019s hand. Any expert Dou Huang would be extremely afraid if Han Feng were to control the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 with his current strength. This naturally included Hu Gan.</p><br/><p>Powerful Dou Qi spread out from Hu Gan\u2019s body causing his sleeves to flap. He slowly exhaled a breath of air, and a thunder-like explosion was emitted from his tongue. The aura on his entire body had also become much stronger amid this strange explosive sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are dreaming if you intend to snatch a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 from the Jia Nan Academy.\u201d Hu Gan laughed coldly as he twisted his body. It disappeared in an instant, and was shockingly in front of Han Feng the next time it appeared. Waves of rolling thunder sounded as the winds from his palms intertwined with each other.</p><br/><p>\u2026...</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you should pull back first. I will deal with him.\u201d Xiao Yan slowly turned his head around and spoke to Zi Yan and Liu Qing with a smile.</p><br/><p>Liu Qing and Zi Yan were watching Xiao Yan with shocked gazes. The powerful aura that spread out from the latter\u2019s body was not the least bit inferior to Fan Lao on the opposite side. Xiao Yan\u2019s strength had basically soared in a frightening manner within a short period of time. Moreover, this kind of great increase was without reason. Although they knew that Xiao Yan possessed a kind of Secret Technique that could allow him to increase his strength within a short period of time, it could at the very most raise Xiao Yan\u2019s strength by a few stars. Now, however\u2026 he basically leaped through two classes, no?</p><br/><p>Liu Qing swallowed a mouthful of saliva. He merely felt his throat become dry. Originally, he had thought that the powerful Dou Technique that Xiao Yan had displayed back then was his final trump card. Only now did he understand that if Xiao Yan were to completely unleash his strength, he would not even be able to endure a single exchange!</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, what kind of medicinal pill did you consume? Why have you become so strong?\u201d Zi Yan could not control the curiosity in her heart, and immediately ignored the somewhat superficial bloody aura within her body that was caused by Fan Lao\u2019s attack as she asked with a surprised face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere can one find such a powerful medicinal pill?\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and pulled at Zi Yan\u2019s ponytail. The latter immediately shook her head in displeasure and avoided him. Only then did Xiao Yan speak, \u201cAlright, little fellow. Bring Liu Qing and Lin Xiuya down. Leave this to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Yan curled her mouth and could only nod her head somewhat unwillingly. \u201cAlright. However that old fellow is too detestable. You must get back at him for me, and make sure to give him a good beating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo problem.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. That brilliant smile caused a chill to form all over Fan Lao\u2019s body not far away.</p><br/><p>Only after seeing Xiao Yan nodding his head in agreement did Zi Yan drag Liu Qing and flashed before appearing beside Lin Xiuya, whose wings on his back had become increasingly illusionary. With one hand grabbing each of them, she swiftly rushed down from the sky and returned to the place where the group of them had stayed earlier.</p><br/><p>Lin Yan, Yan Hao, and the others on a roof watched Zi Yan and the other two rushing down from the sky before hurrying forward.</p><br/><p>Liu Qing and Lin Xiuya merely smiled and shook their heads at faces of the group showed. They immediately lifted their head together without any prior agreement and threw their gazes toward Xiao Yan who was facing Fan Lao in the sky alone. It was a long while later before they let out a sigh. They looked at one another before sighing with a bitter smile, \u201cThis top spot on the Inner Academy\u2019s \u2018Strong Ranking\u2019 should belong to this fellow. It is really unexpected that he actually hid a card so deeply\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Yan, who was the person in question, did not reveal any grimacing expression with regards to the words of these two people. She clearly understood that even she was much weaker compared to the strength that Xiao Yan was currently displaying.</p><br/><p>Lin Yan, Yan Hao, and the others behind the two also smiled bitterly as they nodded. The frightening strength that Xiao Yan suddenly displayed also caused them to be extremely shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really unexpected that you actually possess such a trump card. No wonder Ling-er died in your hands.\u201d Fan Lao\u2019s expression was dark and solemn as he eyed the surging aura of Xiao Yan. His voice was gloomy as he spoke.</p><br/><p>TL: Ling-er - Fan Ling, Fan Lao\u2019s son</p><br/><p>\u201cI did not need to be like this in order to deal with him.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled. His eyes which were staring at Fan Lao slowly became cold. \u201cSince you are also muddling along within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019, you should also know what kind of price a life had there. Who cares if a person was killed regardless of his identity? Forget about your son, even if you, an old dog, who likes human blood were to die, it is likely that not many people would remember you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Fan Lao ended up laughing in his extreme anger. \u201cWhat an arrogant little fellow. Don\u2019t think that your victory is certain just because your strength has soared. What kind of situation have I, Fan Lao, not seen after so many years? You little brat don\u2019t have the qualification to speak to me in this manner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan curled the corner of his mouth slightly and was too lazy to continue speaking nonsense with this old fellow who was overflowing with confidence. He flicked his finger, and a green-colored flame instantly surged out from the tip of his finger. Finally, it turned into two long flame-whips that were swung violently in front of him. Immediately, a great heat that carried a thunderclap resounded.</p><br/><p>Fan Lao\u2019s expression slowly became serious as he sensed the gradually surging flame outside of Xiao Yan\u2019s body. Although his lips spoke those words, he did not dare to look down on the current Xiao Yan by the slightest bit. Due to his Qi Method, his Dou Qi leaned toward the dark and cold side (Yin). This kind of Dou Qi affinity feared the strong yang and explosive fire affinity Dou Qi. Xiao Yan\u2019s Dou Qi was not only of the fire affinity but the flame he was controlling was a spiritual being among the flames: a Heavenly Flame. Hence, Fan Lao suffered a great disadvantage when the two fought. This was not very obvious due to the large gap in their strength earlier. However, Xiao Yan\u2019s strength had currently soared. Along with it, his control of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, and even its temperature had also soared greatly.</p><br/><p>Hence, Fan Lao could no longer adopt the same kind of attitude he did toward Xiao Yan earlier when faced with such a troublesome opponent.</p><br/><p>With a wave of his sleeve, the sea of blood that was dozens of feet wide immediately began to churn. Fan Lao once again hid within it. This sea of blood was created from Dou Qi after practicing his Qi Method until its pinnacle. It would provide an enormous enhancement regardless of whether it was in terms of Dou Qi recovery or attacking during a fight. Moreover, the cover of the sea of blood could even help in hiding one\u2019s body. This so-called sea of blood possessed an enormous amount of credit, credit that allowed Fan Lao to be able to build the Blood Sect within the man-eat-man \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 to what it was and to become a powerful leader.</p><br/><p>Fan Lao\u2019s aura immediately became much more powerful following the disappearance of his body within the sea of blood. That aura which spread across the sky and contained some bloody scent also swiftly soared. In the end, the surrounding sky faintly carried a dark-red color.</p><br/><p>A countless number of students below opened their eyes as they watched the pale-blood color spreading in the sky. A wave of bloody stench also came pouncing on them despite being a great distance away, causing many to feel a chill in their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cA useless move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan simply laughed softly upon seeing the expanding aura of Fan Lao. With a flick of his finger, the green-colored flame curled out from his body in all directions. The temperature in the sky immediately soared. The dark-redness that was spreading through the sky appeared to be like ice cubes meeting boiling oil as it swiftly melted...</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the bloody stench that caused the bodies of a countless number of people to become cold completely disappeared from the horizon.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan glanced faintly at the sea of blood that hid Lao Fan. He let out a smile as he slowly extended his finger and pointed toward the cluster of bloody sea.</p><br/><p>Time paused at this moment. An instant later, an unceasing amount of flame came spreading out with shocking speed. Immediately, they agglomerated into a sea of flame under a countless number of stunned gazes. The bloody aura was swiftly becoming vaporized within that sea of flame\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis sea of blood\u2026 let it also be incinerated.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

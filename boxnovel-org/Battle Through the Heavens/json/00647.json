However, due to the environment, that place will always possess an extremely strong offensive capability. As the saying goes, it is better to scatter than to stop. If you want to end this trouble, it is only natural that you cannot do it by the most forceful method. Should second brother really manage to expand his faction in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019, it would end up helping the Inner Academy by saving a lot of trouble. Moreover, we can also help monitor some of the factions which possess enmity toward the Inner Academy.\u201d Su Qian\u2019s reaction was not beyond Xiao Yan\u2019s expectations. The latter simply smiled and explained.</p><br/><p>The frown on Su Qian\u2019s brow relaxed a little. He was no fool. With his experience, he was naturally able to figure out whether things would be beneficial for him or not.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, First Elder should also be aware of a little of my background. I have a deep enmity with the Misty Cloud Sect. In order to take revenge, I will require quite a strong faction. The \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 is not a bad place.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled faintly as he spoke, \u201cTherefore, even if the faction were to expand in the future, it is likely that it would not be much of a threat to the Inner Academy. If First Elder does not trust my second brother on this point, you should at least be able to trust me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s finger knocked against the surface of the table. He finally nodded a long while later as he said, \u201cWhat you say is not without reason. The \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 has always been a big worry for the Jia Nan Academy. If a faction which is friendly to the Inner Academy were to appear, it would indeed possess an effect that is difficult to measure.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn other words, First Elder agrees to it?\u201d Xiao Yan was slightly happy as he replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, what else can I do other than agree? At this moment, the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 of the Inner Academy requires you to replenish the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 in the long term.\u201d Su Qian helplessly shook his head as replied</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder, these words of yours are spoken like\u2026 Xiao Yan is not an ungrateful person. I owe the Inner Academy a favor by obtaining the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. Won\u2019t I be completely shameful if I used this to threaten you?\u201d Xiao Yan spoke seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, you are not bad when it comes to this point. You view friendship quite seriously. This old me likes it.\u201d Su Qian fondled his beard and nodded his head, feeling pleased. He had always favored and valued Xiao Yan. This was not only because of his strength and his talent, but also his character.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let your second brother feel at ease and do it. The \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 is far too chaotic and straightening it out a little also does have some benefit to our Jia Nan Academy.\u201d Su Qian waved his hand and spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre your injuries alright?\u201d Su Qian changed the topic. He smiled and asked Xiao Yan a question when he noticed that the discussion had come to an end.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fellow, your constitution is really a source of envy. You can lively jump around after only recuperating for a couple of days despite suffering such serious injuries.\u201d Su Qian smacked his mouth and revealed a face filled with envy. This kind of nearly unbeatable kind of constitution was indeed something that others coveted after.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. His constitution was this strong because it had been forged from a countless number of sufferings. This world did not give free lunches. One could forget about any reward without any effort.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you plan to do next? Don\u2019t tell me that you want to go to the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 to help your second brother?\u201d Su Qian\u2019s finger tapped gently on the table as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is able to handle the matter of the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 himself and will send someone to inform me if he really need me to intervene.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head and mused, \u201cI will still remain in the academy for a period of time until I settle the problem regarding her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, there was one other matter. That was to quietly practice the \u2018Open Mountain Seal\u2019 of the \u2018God Seal Technique\u2019 that Xun Er had left behind. A Di class High level Dou Technique. A Dou Techniqueof this class would likely have an extremely powerful strength. If he were to successfully practice it, it would undoubtedly become another trump card of Xiao Yan. It would also increase his chances of victory in the future battle with Yun Shan. However, he needed to keep this a secret. Therefore, it was only natural that Xiao Yan did not mention it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer? Are you talking about that Dou Zong class woman?\u201d Su Qian raised his brows and immediately asked somewhat curiously, \u201cJust where exactly did this woman come from? Why have I never heard of such an expert around this place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan hesitated a little upon hearing this. When he thought that this was not considered a secret, he shrugged his shoulders and gave a brief explanation of Queen Medusa\u2019s origin.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, how unexpected. She is actually the legendary Queen Medusa. Moreover, she is a Medusa after evolution. No wonder\u2026\u201d Su Qian\u2019s face was filled with surprise as he smacked his mouth. He immediately spoke teasingly toward Xiao Yan, \u201cBut, little fellow, you are quite strong. You even dared to provoke this kind of woman. I heard that successive Queen Medusas were all extremely cold-blooded people who killed humans like killing chickens. It is unexpected that she had intervened to rescue you. That is really unbelievable\u2026 back then, an evolved Queen Medusa had appeared on the continent in the past. Coincidentally, she was molested by a young master from a top-tiered faction. In the end, that woman charged into the faction and went on a massacre, decimating that faction. From then on, the men on the continent took a detour whenever they saw Queen Medusa. They are all afraid that they might end up leading their faction to destruction if they were careless. Hee hee, do you know just how lucky you are now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan rubbed the cold sweat off his forehead. The previous Queen Medusas were indeed frightening. There was no need for any reason to kill someone. Hopefully, this current Queen Medusa could be a little more reasonable\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI will be more careful. Thank you First Elder for your reminder.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled bitterly as he cupped his hands toward Su Qian. After which, he walked out of the Meeting Room in front of the brewing smile in the latter\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Su Qian watched Xiao Yan\u2019s disappearing back. Only then did he teasingly mutter with a smile, \u201cHowever, this fellow does not appear to know that despite having such an intense killing nature, Medusa truly loves someone until the end once she has been subdued by him. This fellow\u2026 tsk tsk, his luck with women is indeed quite great\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>.....</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan once again hurried back to \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 after leaving the Meeting Room. He informed Xiao Li of the good news. The latter was also quite happy upon hearing that the Inner Academy did not oppose the plan. He immediately reminded Xiao Yan about some things before he hurriedly left the Inner Academy and headed for the Jia Nan City to summon his subordinates. After which, they headed into the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 to take the opportunity to expand their faction.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was helpless in the face of the impatient Xiao Li. He could only allow the latter to leave. However, Xiao Yan had repeatedly reminded Xiao Li that he should send someone to contact him as soon as possible if there was any trouble. Currently, Han Feng from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 was dead, and the Gold Silver Brothers did not dare to stand out. Given Xiao Yan\u2019s strength, it was already sufficient to sweep aside all those people on the so-called \u2018Black Ranking\u2019.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s life became quiet after Xiao Li left the Inner Academy. He stayed within \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 for another two days before he was finally unable to resist his curiosity for the \u2018God Seal Skill\u2019. Once again, he found an excuse to enter the vast deep mountains.</p><br/><p>......</p><br/><p>The deep mountains were vast and unending. The lush green color continued to extend all the way to the end of one\u2019s sight. A wild wind blew over and the entire mountain range emitted a \u2018hua hua\u2019 sound.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was seated cross-legged on a huge rock on a somewhat empty mountain peak. However, he did not immediately begin to practice the \u2018God Seal Technique\u2019. Instead, he raised his head and looked at the empty sky. A moment later, he helplessly opened his mouth and said, \u201cShow yourself. I know you have been following me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s voice had just sounded when a spot in the sky began to fluctuate slightly. A well-proportioned, graceful, beautiful figure appeared out of nowhere. An ice-cold bright gaze shot toward Xiao Yan\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you seeking death?\u201d Medusa stepped gently in the empty sky just like a fairy who was riding the waves. However, the killing intent on this fairy was a little too dense. In the blink of an eye, she appeared in front of Xiao Yan and spoke coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me \u2018die\u2019 all day long. I am also aware that you are unable to kill me now.\u201d Xiao Yan waved his hand and laughed bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Queen Medusa\u2019s eyebrows were vertical when she heard these words of Xiao Yan. Her long eyes were filled with a dense, cold killing intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should clearly be aware of what I said. Although you have merged with the spirit of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019, you were also influenced by it. Therefore, you have been unable to hurt me, and even frequently follow beside me.\u201d Xiao Yan sighed as he studied Queen Medusa whose face became uglier following his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 can influence me forever. I will be able to kill you sooner or later!\u201d Queen Medusa\u2019s voice was like glacier. It was void of any excess emotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can perform a transaction. What do you say?\u201d Xiao Yan rubbed his somewhat painful head and helplessly spoke.</p><br/><p>Queen Medusa did not have the slightest reaction to Xiao Yan\u2019s suggestion. These past few years, it was due to these various transactions that she finally ended up being entangled with this fellow.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can help you completely remove the influence of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 and allow you to become a true Queen Medusa.\u201d Despite having already decided in her heart that she would ignore any sweet words of Xiao Yan, Queen Medusa\u2019s heart still pounded intensely when she heard the latter say this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy should I trust you?\u201d Queen Medusa\u2019s long pretty eyes narrowed into a lazy arc as she coldly smiled.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved his hand and a shadow shot from his sleeves. Finally, it was thrust into Queen Medusa\u2019s hand. She took a closer look, only to discover it was a scroll. A couple of ancient words were imprinted into her eyes when she slowly opened it. This was a medicinal formula. The medicinal pill that it could refine would coincidentally treat the condition of being influenced by another spirit, something that Queen Medusa was facing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is a tier six medicinal pill, \u2018Soul Recovery Pill\u2019. The medicinal ingredients and other things needed to refine the medicinal pill are not on this scroll. If you agree to my terms, I will help you refine it in the future. What do you say?\u201d Xiao Yan spoke indifferently.</p><br/><p>Medusa\u2019s expression was volatile as she folded the scroll. Her voice was still icy-cold as she inquired, \u201cWhat\u2019s your request?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will follow beside me for one year. You are not allowed to have any killing intent toward me. If I ask you to intervene when necessary, you are not allowed to reject me.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and continued, \u201cOnce one year is over, I will help you refine the medicinal pill. At that time, you can do as you wish if you still want to kill me? What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Queen Medusa\u2019s eyes flickered. Her heart descended into a conflicting struggle.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, as long as you obtain the \u2018Soul Recovery Pill\u2019, you will be a pure Queen Medusa in the future. You will not be influenced by anything. This kind of freedom has a hefty price tag.\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s laughter reverberated beside Queen Medusa\u2019s ear. It was filled with allure.</p><br/><p>Medusa\u2019s delicate hand suddenly tightened. Her icy-cold gaze stared at Xiao Yan as her clear, cold voice caused a joyous arc to be lifted on the corner of the latter\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I will do as you say!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

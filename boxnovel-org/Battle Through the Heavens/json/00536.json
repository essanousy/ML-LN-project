They walked slowly while following the main road. There were occasionally some students who saw the two of them walking side by side along the way. Surprise flashed across their faces. Elder Hao always looked at the others with a cold face. Therefore, other people both feared and respected him. All of them felt extremely surprised when they saw that he engaged in a smiling conversation with Xiao Yan. On top of being surprised, they could not help but view Xiao Yan a little more seriously. Everyone clearly knew the authority of these Elders within the Inner Academy. If someone did not open their eyes and offended them, these Elders may find trouble. Abusing one\u2019s authority for one\u2019s private purposes was something that inevitably existed even within this Inner Academy.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan did not pay much attention to those gazes along the way. Due to Elder Hao being by his side, even some of the students who recognized him and wanted to step forward to issue a challenge also weighed the situation and shrank back. Therefore, it saved Xiao Yan a lot of trouble.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Elder is called Liu Ying, he is the Tower Guardian Elder of the fifth level of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019. It is his turn to rest today, therefore, we can directly go to his living quarters.\u201d Elder Hao told Xiao Yan some of the matters related to that Elder along the way.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly when he heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can simply state the purpose of your visit when you see that fellow. Although his temper is a little strong, you need not be afraid of him. He will not do anything to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He mused for a moment before asking, \u201cDoes this Elder Liu have anything that he specially likes?\u201d Xiao Yan naturally needed to cater to the Elder\u2019s liking if he wanted to successfully obtain the rank 6 Monster Core from the other person\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does he like\u2026 you should clearly understand that upon reaching a class like ours, it is very difficult to move us with ordinary valuables. Instead, some of the things that could aid us in our training possess an enormous attraction to us. Although that fellow is stingy, he is extremely obsessed with training. If you are able to take out an item that would benefit his training, I think that he should be attracted.\u201d Elder Hao voiced his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething that benefits his training\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan muttered softly, \u201cMay I know what is the affinity of the Qi Method that this Elder practices?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFire affinity. It is precisely because of this that his temper is a little strong.\u201d Elder Hao replied and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire affinity\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded slightly. He now had a small understanding within his heart.</p><br/><p>Elder Hao could not help but be a little stunned when he saw the manner of Xiao Yan. Was this fellow really able to take out something that would move that stingy old fellow? That\u2019s right. He is an alchemist. Ordinarily speaking, he should have stored some treasures.</p><br/><p>As the two of them conversed along the way, they had unknowingly approached the inner regions of the Inner Academy. This place was the residence of the Inner Academy Elders and Instructors. The environment was quiet and peaceful. It was many times better than the hostel of the students. This was nothing strange. With the powerful strength of these Elders, the treatment that they received was naturally not something that students like them could compare with.</p><br/><p>They passed through a lush green are before Elder Hao gradually slowed his footsteps a while later. Finally, he stopped at a house that was completely built by emerald-green bamboo.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Elder Liu really knows how to enjoy himself.\u201d Xiao Yan could not help but feel some surprise in his heart when he saw this bamboo house.</p><br/><p>Elder Hao in front of him had lifted his hand and was just about to knock on the door when a powerful and impatient voice was emitted from behind the door, \u201cJust come in if you want to. Why do you need to knock the door? You like this antiquated method. Can\u2019t you be more direct?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out a bitter laugh when he heard the words that were transmitted from within the house. Only then did he understand why Elder Hao told him to directly express the purpose of his visit. Clearly, this was an impatient fellow. He would not accept someone who spoke to him in a roundabout manner.</p><br/><p>Elder Hao did not feel anything as this moment. He pushed opened the door as though he was used to it and walked in while holding a smile on his face as he said, \u201cElder Liu. I have brought someone with me and I\u2019m afraid that you will have to see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it?\u201d Xiao Yan also followed Elder Hao and walked into the house. However, he coincidentally saw a red-robed old man walking in the house. At this moment, the old man\u2019s sleepy eyes were still a little bleary. It appeared that he had just escaped from his sleep. He spoke as he walked and only raised his head when he was at the front of the house. When his gaze drifted toward the young man whose appearance was unclear because of the light from behind him, Elder Liu could not help but frown and said, \u201cBrat, where have you come from. Don\u2019t tell me that you have been chased out of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 by some Elders and want me to go and plead for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStudent Xiao Yan greets Elder Liu.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled slightly, took a step forward and spoke with his hands cupped together.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 huh? Xiao Yan? That Xiao Yan who is able to refine a tier five medicinal pill?\u201d Elder Liu had merely responded with an indifferent sound initially. After all, he had seen too many students who had come here to beg for mercy and was already too lazy to be bothered by their complaints. However, he was a little startled after he heard the somewhat familiar name. His gaze hurriedly shifted to Xiao Yan\u2019s face as he opened his mouth and spoke in a surprised manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He did not expect that his status as an alchemist was so useful. Even this Elder had hurriedly changed his expression when he heard his name.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, this name is extremely well known. Sit. What reason do you have to look for me?\u201d Elder Liu smiled and waved his hand toward Xiao Yan. He sat on the chair before returning to his impatient character as he asked in a pressing manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan tilted his head slightly toward Elder Hao and exchanged glances with him when he heard this. The latter spread his hand, indicating that Xiao Yan would have to handle the remaining matters. Xiao Yan helplessly nodded and mused for a moment. He exercised some discretion in his words before he smiled and said, \u201cThis time around, I have come to look for Elder Liu mainly because this little me is currently lacking something. Coincidentally, Elder Liu is in possession of this thing. Xiao Yan will definitely provide a great reward if Elder Liu promises to exchange this thing with little me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLacking something?\u201d Elder Liu was a little startled. His expression did not change as he placed down the teacup in his hand and said, \u201cWhat is it? Tell me. I will not reject as long as it is not an extremely valuable item.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA rank 6 water affinity Monster Core.\u201d Xiao Yan mentioned casually.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrack!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s words had just sounded when the teacup in Elder Liu\u2019s hand in front of him could not resist the sudden increase in strength. With a clear sound, it turned into a pile of fragments.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*...\u201d Elder Hao coughed softly by the side. This fellow really did view that thing as his life. It appeared that it was going to be quite difficult for Xiao Yan to obtain it this time around.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. This randomly gossiping fellow is the one who tells you that I possess a rank 6 Monster Core right?\u201d Elder Liu rubbed away the water traces on his hand and stared at Elder Hao. Although the First Elder had quietly informed them to look after Xiao Yan, they did not need to look after him to such an extent did they? A rank 6 Monster Core was a rare thing no matter how one placed it. Moreover, this thing is something that he had obtained after risking his life back then. How could he easily give it to someone else?</p><br/><p>\u201cI will openly tell you that I will not give the rank 6 Monster Core to anyone. You should not waste your effort.\u201d In an attempt to remove this thought of Xiao Yan\u2019s, Elder Liu\u2019s first sentence was extremely firm.</p><br/><p>Elder Hao shook his head helplessly. It appeared that there was not much hope for the manner today.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, Elder Liu, a rank 6 Monster Core may indeed be valuable, but it is not something that truly does not have a price. You practice fire affinity Qi Method. Such a water affinity Monster Core does not have the slightest benefit to you. The only reason that you reject me without even thinking should be that you are worried that I am unable to take out something that would truly attract Elder Hao, no?\u201d Xiao Yan did not feel dejected just because of Elder Liu\u2019s firm manner. He smiled slightly before speaking in a slow manner.</p><br/><p>Elder Liu rolled his eyes but did not reply. A rank 6 Magical Beast was something that even the current him could not defeat. Although he viewed this rank 6 Monster Core as a treasure, he was not a fool who hugged it until his old age. This Monster Core may possess a powerful energy but that was a kind of wild and violent energy that had not been refined. A human body would not easily absorb it. Therefore, he would naturally not reject if there was someone who was able to take out something that would move him to exchange for it. However, with the age of Xiao Yan in front of him, Elder Liu really had difficulty believing just how valuable the thing that he could take out was.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Liu should also know that this rank 6 Monster core is unable to be of much use in your hands. Therefore, it would be the best choice to exchange it for something. Elder need not be stubborn. Why don\u2019t you open your mouth and tell me what you want. If Xiao Yan possesses it, I will naturally take it out.\u201d Xiao Yan spoke softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I say, you should not be so antiquated. Although Xiao Yan is young, there might be more treasures on him than you. There will no longer be this shop once you pass this village.\u201d Elder Hao fanned the flames by the side.</p><br/><p>TL: There will no longer be this shop once you pass this village - meaning there will no longer be this opportunity once you miss it.</p><br/><p>Elder Liu\u2019s face alternated between green and white. A long while later, his tensed face finally relaxed. He rubbed his nose and said, \u201cIt is possible if you want to exchange for this rank 6 Monster Core from my hands as long as you give me a \u2018Dou Ling Pill\u2019!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDou Ling Pill? Don\u2019t you have a lion\u2019s mouth, old fellow who won\u2019t die?\u201d Elder Hao by the side immediately leaped up when Elder Liu\u2019s voice sounded. The former widened his eyes and scolded, \u201cThat is a tier 6 medicinal pill. How can Xiao Yan refine it with his current strength? Aren\u2019t you making things difficult for others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liu smacked his lips and ignored him. He only used his gaze to watch Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan frowned slightly. His finger gently tapped on the surface of the table. It was a long while later before he shook his head slightly and said, \u201cI am indeed unable to take out this \u2018Dou Ling Pill\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liu was immediately disappointed when he heard this. He waved his hand in a disspirited manner and said, \u201cPlease leave if you don\u2019t have it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled. He flicked his finger gently on his storage ring. Immediately, a thumb-sized green-colored lotus seed appeared in his palm. The green-colored lotus seed had just appeared when a powerful fiery hot energy reverberated within the room.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and spoke as he eyed Elder Liu, who had straightened in an instant. \u201cI think that Elder Liu might have some interest in this thing.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

According to tradition, the Inner Academy would organize an activity each month where all the students would enter the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 to train. The students greatly supported such an activity. This was because there was no need to pay any \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 to enter the tower to train for this single day. Today was coincidentally, the day of the monthly collective training.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had also heard of such an activity while he was in the academy in the past. However, he had seldom participated in it. This was because he did not need to worry about the problem of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 given his extremely wealthy status. Naturally, he did not need to go and fight with so many people for a training room.</p><br/><p>Following the change in the policy of the Inner Academy during these two years, the number of people in the Inner Academy had gradually greatly increased. Hence, the crowd in the Inner Academy was naturally not something that could be compared with the past.</p><br/><p>Due to this, there were groups that began coming one after another to the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 not longer after the morning bell rang. By the time the sun was hanging in the sky, the spacious open ground outside the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 had already become filled with people.</p><br/><p>Currently, the surroundings of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 had been rebuilt into a large plaza. The middle of the plaza was the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,\u2019 which still only revealed its peak. Additionally, there was a statue standing at the entrance of the tower. The statue was extremely young. A black robe and a warm smile set off the young and clear face, giving it an extremely handsome appearance.</p><br/><p>Almost everyone within the Inner Academy had seen this statue that stood at the entrance. Hence, no one displayed a surprised expression when they walked past it. Occasionally, there would be some students who would pause and bow toward this statue. If one were to carefully observe them, one would realize that these students were wearing a badge on their chest that had a dark-black background with a ruler like thing being carved on it. This badge was not unfamiliar. This was because it was the symbol of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019.</p><br/><p>At this moment, a tall lady was standing prettily in front of the statue. Her gaze contained an unknown feeling as she watched the familiar appearance of the statue in an absent-minded fashion. The lady had quite a pretty face, but the thing that attracted the most attention was that pair of long, smooth, sexy legs. A couple of people walking past would involuntarily sweep their gazes past the former\u2019s legs. However, this scanning was extremely obscure. This was because they were similarly well aware of this woman\u2019s identity. An upper echelon of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019. It was rumored that she was the older cousin of Xiao Yan\u2019s, the founder of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019, Xiao Yu...</p><br/><p>\u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019. This faction was currently just like a truly large being within the Inner Academy. No other faction dared challenge it. Xiao Yu, who possessed quite a high status within it, was naturally someone that no one dared offend. Normally speaking, if there was anyone who coveted her beauty and spoke in an impertinent manner, he would end up with a bruise and swollen face the next day.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou fool, you always love to try appear impressive. In the end\u2026 a statue, is there any meaning? Can it allow you to develop the Xiao clan?\u201d A bitter smile surfaced on Xiao Yu\u2019s face as she softly sighed and muttered.</p><br/><p>A commotion suddenly began to spread across the crowd over the plaza while Xiao Yu was muttering. Immediately, a large crowd came surging in like floodwaters. These people who had swarmed in were all wearing similar badges as Xiao Yu.</p><br/><p>The noise of the entire plaza immediately became softer when they saw this large group of people who had squeezed in. This was especially so when their gaze saw the little girl swinging her pale-purple ponytail leading the group at the front. All of them hurriedly turned their gazes away. That demon-like little fellow was an extremely frightening existence to many people within the Inner Academy.</p><br/><p>The little girl swaggered as she led a large group of people to squeeze into the plaza. She saw Xiao Yu in front of the statue in a glance. With a wave of her small hand, the large group behind her quickly followed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYu-er, you are daydreaming here again.\u201d She obviously looked like a child but she purposefully acted like an elderly person. This scene caused many people to want to laugh. However, other than Xiao Yu who burst out laughing while shaking her head, the remaining people held their mouths tightly shut, afraid that they would emit a laughter and invite that frightening little fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cZi Yan, you think\u2026 he is still alive?\u201d Xiao Yu rubbed the statue before suddenly asking with a smile.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan was startled when she heard this. Her gem like pupils turned gloomy but she recovered swiftly and spoke, \u201cThe chance of survival after being swallowing by a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is very low.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeming to be well aware of this answer, Xiao Yu\u2019s face did not change much. Her delicate hand moved across the statue and laughed softly, \u201cFor some unknown reason, my heart has been pounding rapidly these days. There seems to be something big that\u2019s about to happen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething big would really happen if your heart didn\u2019t beat.\u201d A man and a woman slowly walked out after laughter was transmitted from behind the crowd before speaking to Xiao Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? Quick, look. It\u2019s actually bloody sword Wu Hao and green wooden woman Hu Jia.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are the top five peak experts in the Strong Ranking. It is normally extremely difficult to see them. It is really unexpected that even they have appeared.\u201d</p><br/><p>The appearance of the two people immediately cause the entire plaza to break out in a commotion. Private conversations repeatedly broke out. Clearly, these people felt extremely excited to be able to see people who were truly a renowned top figures within the Inner Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat, have both of your leaves finished?\u201d Xiao Yu softly laughed as she looked at the two.</p><br/><p>Wu Hao and Hu Jia smiled. The two years had also caused the two of them to become much more mature. Their gazes swept over the statue beside Xiao Yu and their smiles were slightly withdrawn. They sighed, \u201cIt is fortunate that Xun Er had already left\u2026 otherwise\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yu was silent. She clearly understood the relationship between Xiao Yan and Xun Er. If the latter was to see him being swallowed by the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 it was likely that she would suffer a pain for the rest of her life. It is somewhat better like this.</p><br/><p>\u201cGong!\u201d</p><br/><p>A clear gong sound suddenly sounded on the plaza while the few of them were silent, causing the noisy plaza to become quiet.</p><br/><p>A sound of rushing wind suddenly sounded after this gong sound. Immediately, a couple of human figures rushed down from the sky before finally appearing on a tall platform.</p><br/><p>The one leading them was surprisingly the white-haired First Elder Su Qian. Behind him were some Elders of similarly old age. The people who attracted the most attention in the entire place were still the three young people behind Su Qian. These three people were not very old, but they possessed an extraordinary aura. The badges that they wore on their chests indicated their identity. They were surprisingly holding the position of Elders.</p><br/><p>An Elder of the Inner Academy would require a minimum strength of a Dou Wang. From this, one could tell that these three young people had already stepped into the Dou Wang class at such a young age!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really unexpected that Lin Xiuya, Liu Qing, and Lin Yan have really remained behind. The others have mostly left the Inner Academy to roam the continent.\u201d Wu Hao smiled and spoke as he studied the three familiar faces on the platform.</p><br/><p>\u201cLin Xiuya and Liu Qing plan to train for a period of time within the Inner Academy. That stubborn Lin Yan said that he had promised to leave with Xiao Yan. Therefore\u2026\u201d Hu Jia helplessly shook her head and sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is indeed very stubborn\u2026\u201d Wu Hao spoke with a bitter smile.</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s gaze slowly swept over the extremely crowded plaza from the high platform. A moment later, he paused on the statue at the entrance of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019. He, in an absent-minded manner, muttered, \u201cIf that fellow is still alive, I\u2019m afraid that even I would have difficulty defeating him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Xiuya and the other two behind Su Qian looked at one another and nodded their heads. Even with their haughtiness, they could only admire that name.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder, according to our news, the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 has invited many other factions to join them recently. They might have some motives. We must guard against them.\u201d An Elder stepped forward and suddenly spoke softly.</p><br/><p>Su Qian lifted his eyebrows and slowly nodded his head. He coldly smiled, \u201cThat Han Feng does indeed have some ability. In only two short years, he has actually been able to establish a \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 to contend with our Jia Nan Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The few Elders nodded their heads slightly. The gathering ability of a tier 6 alchemist was indeed extraordinary. Currently, the strength of the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 was something that even the Jia Nan Academy would have difficulty getting rid of. They knew that the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 had already become a thorn in the First Elder\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it, let\u2019s not discuss such unhappy things at such a time. We have time. Let\u2019s slowly hold it off with them.\u201d Su Qian waved his hand and spoke indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the Elders responded after hearing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is about time. Prepare to open the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019.\u201d Su Qian raised his head to look at the sky as he spoke.</p><br/><p>An Elder acknowledged the order, and flew down from the tall platform. He landed outside the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 and his hand swiftly formed a few seals. After which, Dou Qi was spurted on the main door. Immediately, that thick, heavy, dark-black door slowly opened while emitting some creaking sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember, everyone should enter in an orderly manner. No conflict can occur today. Otherwise, for one week, one will be proh\u2026\u201d Su Qian\u2019s gaze swept over everyone as he spoke in a faint manner. However, before all his words were spoken, his face suddenly changed because of his sharp senses. His gaze suddenly turned toward the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019. At that spot, he clearly sensed that a frighteningly hot temperature was swiftly approaching. He hurriedly cry out sternly, \u201cThere\u2019s a change in the tower. Shut the door immediately. Hurry!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s sudden cry caused the entire place to be completely silent. Countless numbers of gazes were stunned as they watched the sudden change in Su Qian\u2019s expression. They were completely at a loss.</p><br/><p>Although that Elder was uncertain about what exactly happened, he used the fastest speed to shut that heavy large door with a bang upon hearing Su Qian\u2019s loud cry.</p><br/><p>The temperature of the entire place suddenly rose not long after the tower\u2019s door was shut. A loud rumbling similar to the churning of magma softly approached along with an activity that shook the ground and swayed the mountains.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, it\u2019s the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. Is that thing about to erupt again? Everyone, leave the plaza immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s expression became extremely ugly as the temperature of the plaza rose. This kind of situation\u2026 was witnessed back then\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s voice had just sounded when a frighteningly loud sound suddenly reverberated. Everyone could see that the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 was trembling violently.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another loud sound was emitted. The top of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 began to reveal numerous crack lines as thick as a thumb in front of Su Qian\u2019s shocked gaze.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another loud sound appeared. The crack lines immediately covered the entire of the top of the tower. This kind of situation cause a paleness to surge on Su Qian\u2019s face. Would the scene back then once again appear?</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>During the last loud \u2018bang\u2019, the incomparably hard roof of the tower finally burst apart. A bright-red magma peak began to blast out from the tower like a volcano erupting before charging toward the sky in front of a countless number of stunned gazes and began to scatter down.</p><br/><p>The plaza was immediately in a complete chaos as the magma scattered down. However, the magma suddenly solidified when it was still a couple of meters from the ground. A clear and bright laugh that carried a wild joy, which could not be hidden, resounded over the sky like that of rolling thunder.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, I, Xiao Yan, am finally out. Ha ha!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

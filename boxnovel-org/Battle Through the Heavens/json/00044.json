No one was completely sure about what had just happened; they all saw Xiao Ning suddenly gain a boost in strength and then saw him quickly defeated. They were not expecting to see Xiao Ning, after a boost in power, to suffer an even more humiliating defeat with a serious injury from one punch!</p><br/><p>Looking at the field from the Guest platform, Ya Fei\u2019s pearly white hands covered her red lips, her ample breasts moved as her whole body shook in excitement.</p><br/><p>What a strong Dou Technique\u2026What level could it be? Xuan level? How is that possible? Ya Fei gasped, her heart fluttered as she gave the possibility some thought. Xuan level Dou Techniques were not only rare but also difficult to learn.</p><br/><p>After a while, Ya Fei was slowly brought back to reality. Once more turning her thoughts toward Xiao Yan\u2019s previous of Dou Technique, her brow furrowed as she thought of something: If I remember correctly, the Xiao Clan\u2019s highest Dou Technique is a Xuan Level Technique Fissure of the Lion that goes with the Xuan Level Qi Method Raging Lion. Right?</p><br/><p>Based on what I saw, that Dou Technique was definitely not \u2018Fissure of the Lion.\u2019 Hmmm\u2026\u201d Ya Fei stared down at her jade teacup resting gently in her lily white hands. Out of nowhere a thought occurred to her: Could it be\u2026 that that Dou Technique, was not taught to him by Xiao Zhan?</p><br/><p>Her beautiful eyes lazily fluttered as she glanced over at Xiao Zhan with an inconspicuous tilt of her head. While looking, she was able to catch the momentary shock on Xiao Zhan\u2019s face as he also realized that the technique was not a clan technique</p><br/><p>If Xiao Zhan didn\u2019t teach him\u2026\u201d Ya Fei mused, her well-developed chest leaning downwards as her jade fingernails wrapped around her teacup. As she recalled the proficiency Xiao Yan displayed with those Dou Techniques, she couldn\u2019t help but to inwardly think: Then this brat\u2026 he has a mysterious teacher that teaches him behind his clan\u2019s back? Otherwise, a Xuan Level Dou Techniques can\u2019t be mastered that quickly through trial and error with so little experience.</p><br/><p>To be able to teach Xuan level Dou Techniques... that mysterious man\u2019s strength must be at the Dou Ling stage! We have to investigate this matter! Ya Fei considered,as she gracefully put down her jade teacup after wiping a bead of cold sweat from her cheek. Observing Xiao Yan closely, she thought, This little brat\u2026 he gets more mysterious with each passing day. I can\u2019t help but be curious.</p><br/><p>TL: Dou Ling is the level above Da Dou Shi which is where Xiao Yan\u2019s father is at</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Oh Dear...this Yan Er of mine, he\u2019s harder and harder to see through. Beside Ya Fei, Xiao Zhan couldn\u2019t help but sigh silently. His son\u2019s execution of the previous Dou Technique was so well done that he silently cheered when he saw that. From an damage point of view, that Dou Technique was on par with Xiao Clan\u2019s Xuan Level Dou Technique \u201cFissure of the Lion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Slowly shaking his head, Xiao Zhan exhaled deeply. With a sad look, he thought, I\u2019m afraid that there is someone teaching Yan Er behind my back.</p><br/><p>But who is teaching him? Xiao Zhan answered while scratching his chin. He couldn\u2019t help but look to the far away Xun Er. At this moment, the little girl was resting her cheeks on her hands, a faint smile on her face as she looked at Xiao Yan standing in the limelight.</p><br/><p>Could it be her? A seed of curiosity was planted into his mind. Thinking about how close Xun Er and Xiao Yan were, Xiao Zhan forcibly justified that thought.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>On the stage, Xiao Yan let out a breath of stale air as his rock hard arms slowly reverted back to their original state. Even his sleeves were beginning to slowly fall down and back into silky smooth fabric.</p><br/><p>Twisting his head, Xiao Yan turned to face Xiao Yu, who was rushing forward and picking up the unconscious Xiao Ning. Xiao Yan looked on with indifference and his heart didn\u2019t have the slightest sliver of pity. If he had not learned two Xuan level Dou Techniques, then his own right hand would have been broken by Xiao Ning\u2019s attack. Since others did not show mercy to him then he would have no reason to be an idiotic good person.</p><br/><p>Putting his hands back into his pockets, Xiao Yan walked past the dumbstruck second elder, asking \u201cThe battle has ended, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gulping, the second elder regained his senses and nodded once. As he started to announce that the battle is over, he was interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold it!\u201d Under the platform, Xiao Yu was carrying a blood-covered Xiao Ning. Her voice brimming with hatred.</p><br/><p>The second elder creased his eyebrows, \u201cXiao Yu, what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Handing the unconscious Xiao Ning to another clan member, Xiao Yu leaped onto the platform vigorously. The grudge she held against Xiao Yan could clearly be seen, \u201cXiao Ning is your older cousin, how could you beat him up so viciously?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Yu\u2019s questioning, Xiao Yan sneered while a vicious smile appeared on his face, \u201cAlthough this was only supposed to be a challenge, he violated the rules. After losing once, he ingested Qi Gathering Powder and attacked me in that powered-up state. Do you really think he showed me mercy? If I didn\u2019t resist, would you be furious because I\u2019m hurt? Is Xiao Ning a human while I, Xiao Yan am not? Xiao Yu, aside from being biased against me, what else are you capable of doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being bombarded with questions like firecrackers on rope, Xiao Yu\u2019s mind grew sluggish. Her pretty red cheeks turned white then quickly flamed red in anger. With her arrogant attitude, she was never lectured in public before. As she exhaled to calm her anger, she stated coldly, \u201cI don\u2019t care for your talk, I only know that you have wounded my younger brother. So now, I challenge you! If you have the skills, then accept my challenge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yu, withdraw your challenge, this is not your place! This is a competition for those under the level of Dou Zhe, you don\u2019t qualify!\u201d The second elder chided out from the side.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yu refused to back down. She bit her lip in anger while glaring at Xiao Yan, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t dare accept.\u201d</p><br/><p>This idiotic woman.</p><br/><p>Inwardly fuming, Xiao Yan cursed in rage, his first battle with Xiao Ning had already used up a lot of his Dou Qi and now he was going to be battling with a 3 star Dou Zhe. He was clearly at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p>\"Don\u2019t have the guts to accept a challenge from a woman?\" Staring coldly at Xiao Yan, Xiao Yu felt a hint glee and openly sneered at him.</p><br/><p>Brushing his nose with his thumb, Xiao Yan's mouth twitched slightly and his black pupils shimmered ominously.</p><br/><p>As Xiao Yan began to prepare himself to beat the long legged woman, a silver bell like laugh sounded as someone softly floated onto the platform.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a voice was heard calling from the platform, \"Cousin Xiao Yu, brother Xiao Yan is already tired and yet you're still challenging him. Are you trying to take advantage of him? Cousin Xiao Yu, if you really want to fight someone, then why don't you let Xun Er play with you?\"</p><br/>\n</div>"}

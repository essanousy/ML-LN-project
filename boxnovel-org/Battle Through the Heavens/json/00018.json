Then, he, along with Xun Er, lazily walked out of the hall while chatting.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, just wait. When you get kicked out of the clan, I\u2019ll have all the time in the world for revenge! Without the clan leader\u2019s protection, you are nothing!\u201d Watching the disappearing Xiao Yan, Xiao Ning felt a fury burn in his chest. As if to show his dedication, he smacked the bookshelf next to him, leaving a light handprint.</p><br/><p>After leaving the Dou Technique Hall, Xiao Yan first accompanied Xun Er to nearby mountains for an entire afternoon before going back to his room when the sky turned dark.</p><br/><p>After getting back to his room and closing the door, Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders sagged down. After placing his scroll on a nearby table and drinking a cup of tea he fearfully said: \u201cThis girl, she sure can walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat girl\u2019s history isn\u2019t normal either.\u201d An old voice resounded through the room.</p><br/><p>Tiredly raising his head and seeing the ghost-like Yao Lao, Xiao Yan curled his lips and asked: \u201cDoes teacher know her history?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, I think I know a bit\u2026\u201d Yao Lao smiled but when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s curious glance, he said: \u201cDon\u2019t ask. It\u2019s useless to you right now. So, it\u2019s better if you don\u2019t waste your effort on it. What I can say is that her background is pretty powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolling his eyes, Xiao Yan gave Yao Lao a middle finger.</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you go get this trash? Do you think that you have a lot of time?\u201d Yao Lao came to the table and flipped through the scroll, only to be appalled by it.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrash?\u201d Xiao Yan cried out: \u201cBesides Vacuum Hand, I don\u2019t know any other Dou Techniques. Before, I only knew to train restlessly and didn\u2019t know any Dou Techniques and only the Huang Level Dou Techniques can be learned by anyone in the clan. If I don\u2019t learn these, what would I use to defeat others in the Coming of Age Ritual?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOhh, so you want to swindle a Dou Technique from me\u2026\u201d The shrewd Yao Lao understood Xiao Yan\u2019s intent immediately.</p><br/><p>Even though Xiao Yan had his plan exposed, he didn\u2019t pretend as if that wasn\u2019t his plan and instead looked at Yao Lao with puppy eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s so great about Dou Techniques? Once you learn Alchemy, people will be fighting to gift you high level Dou Techniques!\u201d Yao Lao lightly smiled and ignored the ever darkening face of Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I need high level Dou Techniques, Right Now!\u201d Xiao Yan said depressedly.</p><br/><p>Seeing the sad Xiao Yan, Yao Lao laughed cheerfully: \u201cWhatever, after all you are my student, although somewhat pitiful. So that you don\u2019t become a cripple, I\u2019ll teach you something!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Xiao Yan perked up; he was very curious as to what kind of Dou Technique his mysterious teacher would give him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven though your vacuum hand is Xuan level, its somewhat weak for a technique at that level. Since your Dou Qi isn\u2019t too strong right now, I\u2019ll teach you a Dou Technique that\u2019s at the Xuan level but only needs for you to be at 5 Duan Qi to be useful.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat tier in the Xuan level?\u201d Hearing that the technique was another Xuan level Dou Techniques, the eyes of Xiao Yan lit up and he asked while licking his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it was Xuan High level. I remember that the owner of this Dou Technique begged me to accept it. Even though I didn\u2019t have much interest in such things, he was really persistent so I accepted and made a pill for him.\u201d Yao Lao carelessly said. His casual mentionings made the Xuan level Dou Technique seem like trash!</p><br/><p>\u201cXuan High level? Begging to give you it?\u201d A few black lines appeared on the forehead of Xiao Yan. The technique that was a whole tier higher than the top Dou Technique in the entire Xiao Clan was worthless in the eyes of Yao Lao! Xiao Yan didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry at the huge difference.</p><br/><p>\u201cClose your eyes and focus, I\u2019ll teach it to you.\u201d After ordering Xiao Yan, Yao Lao stretched out his finger and lightly tapped Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead.</p><br/><p>With a slight headache, Xiao Yan felt a huge amount of information flood into his brain.</p><br/><p>\u201cOctane Blast: Xuan High Level Dou Technique, close-combat Dou Technique. Focus\u2019 on attacks and when mastered, attacks have eight different forces that stack up and the power is equal to a Di Low level Dou Technique!</p><br/><p>Slowly regaining his senses and quickly skimming over the new information, Xiao Yan let out a breath, the attack is equal to a Di Low level Dou Technique?</p><br/><p>In the Dou Qi Mainland, whether its a Dou Technique or a Qi Method, the difference between a Xuan level technique and a Di level technique was enormous. The Di level technique would be on a completely different level and yet this Octane Blast claims that it can rival a Di level technique with its attack!</p><br/><p>Swallowing dryly, Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes became blank. If I really learn this Dou Technique then I can probably beat up Xiao Ning with my 4 Duan Qi\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be too greedy. Even though Octane Blast doesn\u2019t have high requirements of one\u2019s Dou Qi, it has a huge toll on the body. This technique is a close combat Dou Technique and with your weak arms and legs, if you really try to use it, you\u2019ll probably end up with broken limbs before you even touch your opponent.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s voice was like a bowl of cold water and washed away Xiao Yan\u2019s excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow would I increase the strength of my body?\u201d After pausing, Xiao Yan hurriedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cRaising Dou Qi is the best way to increase the strength of one\u2019s body. With higher Dou Qi, the body will become stronger. Of course, if you want to go faster, than you would need some external stimulus.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s eyes twinkled with mischief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat external stimulus?\u201d Watching the smiling Yao Lao, Xiao Yan suddenly felt a great danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet beat up! The more you get beat up, the better!\u201d Yao Lao had a cold laugh while Xiao Yao had a stiff face\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Although the strength of a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was extremely great, it should not have much of an appeal to the Snake-People race. After all, this kind of wild and extremely destructive \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was like water to fire for their icy blood.</p><br/><p>Thus, when they heard Queen Medusa using a somewhat regretful tone to reject the offer, Gu He, as well as Yan Shi, Feng Li and the others beside him had completely stunned faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas this woman\u2019s mind spoiled\u2026 what\u2019s the point in keeping a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 that does not have much benefit to her? Was it not better to exchange it for something that would be useful to her and create a win-win scenario?\u201d Yao Shi helplessly shook his head and softly mumbled in puzzlement.</p><br/><p>Beside him, Feng Lin also shook his head. His face was filled with incomprehension.</p><br/><p>Compared to their shock, Yue Mei and Mo Basi on the city wall were much calmer. From the rejection of Queen Medusa, they had clearly understood what exactly she was planning to do\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, as expected. Her Majesty really looks like she wants to do that. Otherwise. it would have been unlikely for her to reject this kind of trade.\u201d Yue Mei sighed gently and whispered.</p><br/><p>Mo Basi nodded his head gently. There was a worry and bitterness on his feminine eagle like face.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, Queen Medusa lives up to her name. She could reject such good terms with such decisiveness.\u201d With his body hidden under the huge rock, Xiao Yan raised his head, eyed the bewitching beauty and involuntarily sucked his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed a little strange\u2026 According to logic, the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 does not have much attraction to the Snake-People\u2026 Why did she reject that offer? Don\u2019t tell me she is afraid that after Gu He obtains the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, his increased strength would endanger the Snake-People race? No, this reasoning does not seem to make much sense. A strong person such as Gu He would seldom join the fight between both sides. Otherwise, they would have started fighting the moment Queen Medusa appeared.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s voice was filled with doubt. He mused for a long while before he appeared to suddenly recall something. He let out a soft involuntarily cry, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Teacher?\u201d Xiao Yan knit his eyebrows together and inquired softly in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will tell you in detail later\u2026\u201d Yao Lao quickly replied. After which, he became silent and did not respond regardless of how Xiao Yan shouted in his heart.</p><br/><p>After shouting one more time, Xiao Yan was speechless as he shook his head. He mumbled softly, \u201cActing so mysteriously\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Queen Medusa\u2019s rejection caused Gu He to still for a moment. Fortunately, his tolerance was not something that an ordinary person could compare with. In a moment, he quickly withdrew the stunned expression on his face. He frowned and looked at Queen Medusa in the distance. Sighing gently, he said, \u201cYour Majesty, your rejection is really beyond my expectation. I don\u2019t like to be secretive so the terms just now were the most precious things that I could offer. Originally I thought that they could move Your Majesty. Unfortunately\u2026 It seems that I have miscalculated.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster Gu He, your terms have got me very interested, but because of some reasons, the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is extremely important to me now.\u201d The regret on Queen Medusa\u2019s pretty face was quite difficult to hide. Evidently, she was not completely indifferent to the items that Gu He had mentioned.</p><br/><p>Gu He sighed. The expression on his face was somewhat listless. He clearly understood that if Queen Medusa was unwilling to hand over the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, the strength of the few of them would not be able to force her hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you tell me why you want to keep the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019?\u201d Gu He laughed bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m sorry. No.\u201d Queen Medusa shook her head and waved her hand lazily. She said in a bland voice, \u201cForget it. Grandmaster Gu He, go back to where you came from. As for that mysterious compensation, forget it. It\u2019s fine as long as you leave here quickly. The leaders of the Eight Large Tribes of the Snake-People race are already rushing here. Among them, there are some who have extreme hatred toward you humans. Thus, you should leave as soon as possible. Otherwise, there may be some unnecessary trouble when they appear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Queen Medusa\u2019s words, Gu He smiled bitterly and sighed. He tilted his head to face his few companions with a helpless face.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld He, are we just going to leave like that?\u201d Yan Shi glanced at Queen Medusa in the distance and said with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat can we do if we don\u2019t leave? It\u2019s not like you don\u2019t know Queen Medusa\u2019s strength. Do you think it is possible for us to forcefully take it?\u201d Gu He sighed and said. To be honest, he naturally did not want to leave empty handed. However, the opponent\u2019s strength was too great. Moreover, this was the territory of the enemy. If they were to use force, the ending might not be too pleasant.</p><br/><p>Hearing Gu He\u2019s words, Yan Shi and Feng Li became slightly sluggish. With their strength, they naturally could not challenge Queen Medusa. Their gaze immediately shifted toward the black-robed person by the side and softly asked, \u201cWhat is Sect Leader Yun\u2019s opinion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Yan Shi\u2019s and Feng Li\u2019s action, Gu He also turned his gaze toward the black-robed person, waiting for her to speak.</p><br/><p>The black-robed person was quiet. She did not immediately answer Yan Shi\u2019s question. Since she did not speak, everyone could only quietly wait. Queen Medusa and the others opposite also shifted their gazes to the black-robed person.</p><br/><p>The black-robed person was the focus of everyone\u2019s attention. A long while later, she moved slightly. Her human figure slowly took a step forward and the black robe was slightly raised, revealing a snow white meagre and graceful chin. Her faint cool voice was briskly emitted, \u201cI have once haphazardly read some information about the Queen of the Snake-People from an ancient book. It said that once the Queen Medusa reaches the peak of a Dou Huang, she can undergo a strange evolution if she has sufficiently good luck. The Queen Medusa which has undergone the evolution would not only be able to transform into a human body but her strength would also be promoted into that of a Dou Zong. However, the chances of such evolution succeeding are extremely low. Moreover\u2026 the most essential thing needed for this evolution is a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019... I think that the reason why Queen Medusa was not willing to hand over the Heavenly Flame is because she is planning on undergoing this evolution that requires the help of a \u2018Heavenly Flame.\u201d The black-robed person tilted her head slightly and spoke blandly,</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is so\u2026\u201d Yao Lao suddenly appeared upon hearing the voice that sounded in the sky. He said with a shocked sigh, \u201cHow unexpected. Queen Medusa is planning on doing this\u2026 uh? Hey, boy, are you listening?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan regained his mind after being pulled back by Yao Lao\u2019s words. He said in an uncertain soft voice, \u201cThis voice\u2026 Why is it different from that night? Moreover, it has a little familiar yet foreign feeling\u2026 Teacher, do you have this feeling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I have nothing better to do than to care about women\u2019s voices?\u201d Yao Lao said helplessly. The attention he paid to medicinal pills far exceed that of women. Regardless of how beautiful the voice was, it was difficult for him to feel any infatuation.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*...\u201d Xiao Yan let out an awkward cough and could only put aside the question of the origin of the voice from his mind. He softly said, \u201cSo Queen Medusa can really evolve into a Dou Zong with the help from the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIndeed she can. However, this evolution is extremely dangerous. If it were not to be done properly, she will be completely incinerated into nothingness by the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. But if she were able to withstand it, she will undergo an extremely strange evolution. I am also not really certain about what kind of transformation would occur. This kind of thing is usually only known by the person involved.\u201d Yao Lao said with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed bitterly. Why was the situation becoming more and more complex. He could only helplessly shake his head. Lifting his head to watch the calm sky, he said softly, \u201cIt is better if they quickly start fighting. That way, I will have the chance to go in and steal the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019...\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Qi of Queen Medusa seems a little strange\u2026 Hm, it seems to have an illusionary feeling.\u201d Sweeping his Spiritual Perception across the empty space, Yao Lao suddenly said strangely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He blinked his eyes, feeling baffled. A long while later, he said in a stunned voice, \u201cYou mean that this Queen Medusa is a fake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are very far away and I only roughly sensed a little because I was afraid of being discovered. There seems to be something wrong.\u201d Yao Lao helplessly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThings really are getting more and more complex.\u201d Xiao Yan mumbled once more and gradually became quiet. He once again threw his gaze toward the sky.</p><br/><p>Hearing the words the black-robed person said, there was an obvious change to Queen Medusa\u2019s expression. Her captivating eyes stared intently at the black-robed person with a cold aura hovering over her. She said in a soft voice, \u201cI did not expect that you knew about such things. It really surprises me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot only do I know that you need a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 to complete your evolution, but I also know that\u2026 The current you is merely an energy body that possesses the thoughts of Queen Medusa. I think that the real Queen Medusa should be at some place preparing to evolve.\u201d The black-robed person said in a faint voice.</p><br/><p>As the black-robed person said those words, everyone from both sides were shocked. Yue Mei and Mo Basi\u2019s faces changed drastically. They glanced at each other and saw a worried feeling in the each other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Leader Yun, you mean that the current Queen Medusa is merely an energy body?\u201d Yan Shi pointed at Queen Medusa far away and said with a stunned voice. From his senses, he did not find anything inappropriate.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The black-robed person nodded her head. She lifted her feet and quietly stepped downwards. Her body instantly\u2026 disappeared.</p><br/><p>At the moment when the black-robed person disappeared, the pretty face of Queen Medusa far away changed. She was about to move when a dark black figure appeared in an instant behind her. A jade white hand was extended out and landed on Queen Medusa back in a seemingly slow yet fast manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch insolence!\u201d Seeing that black-robed person who attacked in a flash, Yue Mei and Mo Basi\u2019s face suddenly changed. The pairs of energy wings on their back flapped and swiftly pounced toward the black-robed person.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, the both of you better not randomly interfere.\u201d Two figures flashed across. In the middle of the journey, Yan Shi and Feng Li blocked the two of them.</p><br/><p>The originally peaceful atmosphere in the sky immediately transformed into an aggressive one.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the actions of those around, the black-robed person leaned her body forward and eyed Queen Medusa whose body was stiff. In a soft voice, she said, \u201cAm I right, Your Majesty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really live up to being a Dou Huang by being able to discover my energy avatar so quickly.\u201d Queen Medusa\u2019s narrow and long pupils shrunk as she softly laughed. Her manner of leisure did not show any panic at being caught.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think the Your Majesty\u2019s real body cannot be disturbed now, no? Otherwise you would not allow us to act so presumptuously. Ah\u2026 quite a good opportunity.\u201d The black-robed person smiled. Her palm suddenly shook and a ferocious force was unleashed from her body, heavily striking Queen Medusa\u2019s back. Following a muffled sound, the bewitching and moving Queen Medusa in midair immediately turned into pale purple smoke that slowly rose and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have finally begun fighting\u2026\u201d Watching that black-robed person in the sky who did not hesitate in attacking, Xiao Yan let out a soft cheer. His face was filled with a brilliant smile.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

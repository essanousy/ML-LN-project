Why did this legendary Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint appear on Xiao Yan\u2019s body?</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s related to that ancient map!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao frowned before he suddenly recalled something. That ancient map was the only relationship between Xiao Yan and the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint. Xiao Yan had gathered that thing for many years and had finally obtained all of them, but he had only gained some secret information that was not really a secret. However, Yao Lao had clearly remembered that a light had shot into Xiao Yan\u2019s head after the ancient map had been gathered. That light might be the thing causing this situation to occur in Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Xun Er asked a little anxiously. No one knew whether this Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint was good or bad, but he was possessing Xiao Yan\u2019s body at this moment. If something unexpected happened, the one who would suffer the most would undoubtedly be Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t panic\u2026 since he has intervened to rescue all of us, he likely does not have any ill intentions. His aim should be the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame\u2026\u201d The ancestor from the Pill Tower remarked in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis brat\u2026 how did he attract the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint? This Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint does not appear to be in a spiritual form. Instead, it is more like a remnant imprint, but just this remnant imprint actually possesses such a mighty strength. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint really lives up to his reputation.\u201d Old Man Hun Mo\u2019s and everyone\u2019s eyes locked on Xiao Yan as this thought continued to appear in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan, who had been possessed by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint, slowly lifted his head while everyone was dealing with different thoughts. He waved his sleeve and the cream-white circular barrier slowly disappeared. A pair of white eyes looked at the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cPurifying Demonic Lotus Saint? How is this possible? How can you still be alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>That Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame in the sky quickly focused on Xiao Yan the moment the light barrier scattered. His heart formed a great storm when he saw who that figure belonged to on the surface of Xiao Yan\u2019s body. A shocked roar filled with disbelief reverberated across the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that you have yet to calm the violence within your heart after being sealed for thousands of years\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard, Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint, you ungrateful bastard. Would you have been able to attain your achievements without me? I have aided you so much, but you ended up sealing me in the end. Ha ha, you deserve to be killed by the backlash!\u201d The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame looked at \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019 with a ferocious expression as he crazily laughed. It seemed like he wanted to pour all of the monstrous hatred in his heart out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am responsible for you becoming this brutal. The destructive force of the demonic flame is far too great. If you are allowed to leave as you please, the world would end up facing a great disaster.\u201d \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019 slowly shook his head as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph, a mere remnant image dares to act arrogantly in front of me. Do you really think that you are still that all powerful Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint?\u201d The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame glared at \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019 with all the hatred he felt. The seal formed by his hands suddenly changed, and those two incomparably huge fire arrays began to rotate. \u201cThis array was personally placed by you back then. Today, I will let you have a taste of its might!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRefine!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame furiously cried out after his words sounded. Two light pillars filled with a destructive force formed as one shot from the sky formation and one from the earth formation. After which, they had been aimed at where \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019 and closed in on him with lightning-like speed.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s expressions changed after seeing the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame unleash the might of the formation again. If that light pillar struck them, it was likely that less than five would end up surviving\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSwoosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those two light pillars heading toward the group suddenly came to a halt after this calm voice sounded\u2026</p><br/><p>The light pillars paused around fifty feet both in above and below everyone. That destructive force radiating from it caused everyone\u2019s skin to turn somewhat numb.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Refining Sky Ancient Formation was created by me. You are no match for me in terms of understanding it\u2026\u201d A faint smile rose on \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019s\u2019 face. He looked at the ugly expressions of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame as he softly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame involuntarily cursed upon seeing the pillars stop. However, his curse had only just sounded when his expression changed. He had discovered that his control over the formation was gradually disappearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cRumble!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two huge fire arrays present trembled at this moment. Finally, layer after layer of cream-white flames suddenly shot out of the formation and entered the body of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. After these flames entered his body, the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame began to lose control of the Refining Sky Ancient Formation.</p><br/><p>\u201cPurifying Demonic Lotus Saint, I will fight it out with you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame quickly turned blood-red after losing control over the formation. He was aware of the frightening strength this formation possessed. If the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint were to gain control of it, he would end up having difficulty escaping the seal again. He had already lived a couple thousand years in such a bitter fashion and had already become incomparably tired of it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDemonic Flame World Destruction!\u201d</p><br/><p>The body of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame rapidly swelled. Finally, it emitted a \u2018bang\u2019 and transformed into a monstrous flame that spread. The energy present within this space was vaporized by the extremely high temperature in an instant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d</p><br/><p>A Ban Sheng emitted a miserable screech after the strength within the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame\u2019s body erupted. The Dou Qi within his body began to burn as his meridians became distorted\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon after this Ban Sheng let out a miserable screech, his body erupted into a cluster of black ashes, which drifted into the sea of magma below. Everyone around felt their limbs turn cold because of these ashes. The energy in the realm had been vaporized by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. If they continued to remain, they would not be able to replenish the energy within their bodies. They would only end up with one final fate\u2014being incinerated to death.</p><br/><p>Even Zi Yan was not confident that she could rely on her Dou Qi to resist the terrifying temperature of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. Hence, one needed to quickly leave this damn realm if one wished to live.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHurry up and leave. No one will be able to live if the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame really explodes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone felt a wild joy in their hearts after hearing the indifferent words that came from \u2018Xiao Yan.\u2019 Some did not even give the matter any thought as they immediately moved and rushed to the spatial tunnel.</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung miss, we should also hurry up and leave!\u201d Gu Nanhai faced Xun Er and spoke. This realm was far too dangerous. No one had expected the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame to be this terrifying.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Xiao Yan ge-ge\u2026\u201d Xun Er knit her brows. Her eyes locked onto Xiao Yan, but Xiao Yan seemed to have been possessed by the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint. Who could guarantee that the Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint would not do anything to Xiao Yan if she simply left?</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should leave first. It is pointless to be worried. We will not help Xiao Yan by staying here. That Purifying Demonic Lotus Saint has borrowed his body to appear. It is likely that he will not harm Xiao Yan\u2026\u201d Yao Lao mused for a moment before clenching his teeth and stating in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Xun Er gently bit her lower red lip with the her teeth after hearing this statement. Her eyes revealed her hesitation. She was really worried to leave Xiao Yan alone in this lifeless realm. Moreover, the ferocious Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame present.</p><br/><p>The cream-white flame in the sky continued to widen while everyone was hesitating. In the end, a pink color gradually began to appear in the middle of the flame. These pink flames slowly gathered before a bright-pinkish-red demonic fire lotus appeared in the sky and slowly rotated.</p><br/><p>Even an expert like Gu Nan Hai became a flushed red after this bright-red fire lotus appeared. The Dou Qi within their bodies felt like it was boiling, as though it was about to ignite.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was impossible to continue delaying any longer at this moment. Gu Nanhai grabbed Xun Er\u2019s hand. His body flashed as he rushed toward the spatial tunnel. Behind them, Yao Lao once again glanced at \u2018Xiao Yan,\u2019 who was standing with his hands behind him, but he could only clench his teeth and swiftly follow.</p><br/><p>An unknown feeling rose within Xun Er\u2019s heart when she saw \u2018Xiao Yan\u2019 grow distant in her eyes. She felt that Xiao Yan needed her\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cElder, once you return, please tell father that Xun Er will be willful this one time!</p><br/><p>Xun Er bit her lower lip. Her hand suddenly shook as she escaped Gu Nanhai\u2019s grasp. Her palm pressed against the Gu Nanhai\u2019s back as a gentle force sent him into the spatial tunnel.</p><br/><p>This unexpected change had clearly exceeded Gu Nanhai\u2019s expectations. Hence, he didn\u2019t have time to react. He simply entered the spatial tunnel and disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 ugh, take good care of Xiao Yan. We will wait for the both of you to come out!\u201d Yao Lao, who was behind, widened his mouth upon seeing Xun Er remain. He could only bitterly smile and let out a quiet sigh. His body moved and entered the spatial tunnel. He was quite confident in Xiao Yan. Xiao Yan had experienced all sorts of difficulties during these years. This time around, he would definitely successfully escape!</p><br/><p>The spatial tunnel finally disappeared after Yao Lao rushed into it. Xun Er turned around. Her pretty eyes were grave as she looked at the figure standing with his hands behind his back. Golden flames slowly swept out of her body.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, this time around, Xun Er will accompany you\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

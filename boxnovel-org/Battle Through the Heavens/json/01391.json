Xiao Yan did not make this wormhole known to the public. Although the fees collected from those using the wormhole would be quite a fat sum, Xiao Yan felt that it was better to keep a low profile when it came to such things. Otherwise, it might stir some unnecessary trouble since there was only one wormhole that lead to the Central Plains from deep within the north-western part of the continent. It would cause many to feel jealous if word were to spread.</p><br/><p>A dark-black wormhole was suspended in the air within an incomparably large hall. It was slowly rotating while waves of shocking spatial fluctuations were emitted from the wormhole.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this a wormhole\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of Cai Lin\u2019s group were a little stunned and curious as they observed this wormhole. This was their first time seeing a wormhole. Such a thing was rarely seen in a place like the north-western region of the continent.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. Standing beside him was the Little Fairy Doctor, Tianhuo zun-zhe, and Qing Lin. Those experts who had been invited had already returned to the Central Plains soon after resolving the trouble from the Profound Lion Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother, second brother, we will be leaving. If anything happens in the future, you can send someone to the Falling Star Pavilion. There will be someone there to receive you\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan turned his head, looked at Xiao Ding and Xiao Li before he spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>The Xiao duo nodded when they heard this information. \u201cUnderstood. Take care.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled, but he did not say anything unnecessary. He cupped his hands to everyone present and then took the lead to step into the wormhole. He immediately disappeared. Cai Lin, who was carrying Xiao Xiao, swiftly followed behind him as did the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ding and Xiao Li softly sighed with a sense of loss as they watched Xiao Yan\u2019s group disappear within the wormhole. They remained a little longer before leading their people away.</p><br/><p>The Inner Hall of the Falling Star Pavilion\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 your daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao was studying the white-clothed little girl. She was hugging Xiao Yan\u2019s thigh and using her large dark-black eyes to stare at him. His elderly face was covered with a stunned expression.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily smiled and nodded when he saw the way Yao Lao acted. He was aware that Yao Lao had been captured by the Hall of Souls when Cai Lin was suspected of being pregnant. Therefore, he was unaware of this situation, so Xiao Yan briefly explained what had occurred back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee, how unexpected, how really unexpected\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Even with Yao Lao\u2019s usual unperturbed temperament, he still involuntarily shook his head after hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s story. His eyes swept over Cai Lin as he teased, \u201cBack then, this wife of yours really hated you. If not for the old me, I\u2019m afraid that you would have been killed by her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Cai Lin\u2019s cold face turned a little red when she heard Yao Lao\u2019s words. Back then, she had quietly exchanged blows with Yao Lao many times. However, she had not expected the old man from back then, who had appeared only a little stronger than her, to actually be so strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xiao, quickly greet grand-teacher.\u201d Cai Lin gently patted Xiao Xiao\u2019s little head and softly told her what to do.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Xiao blinked her large black eyes. She glanced at Xiao Yan somewhat hesitantly. Only after seeing him smile and nod her head, she timidly called out, \u201cGrand-teacher\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A joyous smile emitted from Yao Lao\u2019s heart surfaced on his face after he heard Xiao Xiao\u2019s soft voice. He did not have any children but regarded Xia Yan as his own son. From his perspective, Xiao Yan\u2019s daughter was just like his very own granddaughter. Regardless of how strong an old man at his age was, their hearts would ultimately feel a gentleness for little children.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao walked forward. The corner of his eyes contained a smile as he touched Xiao Xiao with a face full of love. After which, his shriveled hand squeezed Xiao Xiao\u2019s little hand. A joy surfaced in his eyes a moment later as he said, \u201cWhat a powerful Spiritual Strength. She is also of the fire affinity and her body similarly possesses a trace of wood. It not out of the realm of possibility for her to be an alchemist\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled when he heard Yao Lao\u2019s exclamation. He had already sensed that Xiao Xiao could be an alchemist with her constitution. Her current abilities were much better than his back then. If she was properly groomed, her future potential would be extraordinary.</p><br/><p>\u201cHer Spiritual Strength is even stronger than when I discovered you back then. Moreover, her constitution is many times greater than yours. If she is properly groomed, her future achievements will be even greater than yours, her father\u2019s\u2026\u201d Yao Lao\u2019 had an excited glint in his eyes. This kind of glint was something that Xiao Yan had seen when he had met Yao Lao for the first time.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled when he heard Yao Lao\u2019s evaluation. Talent and constitution might be important, but one\u2019s future achievements were determined by one\u2019s perseverance. The reason that Xiao Yan was able to reach this stage today was not because he had relied on his talent. Instead, he had achieved breakthroughs from lingering between life and death during one bloody battle after another\u2026</p><br/><p>A true expert did not rely on talent but on great perseverance!</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s hand continued to pinch Xiao Xiao\u2019s bones. His hands used a little more force, causing Xiao Xiao\u2019s little mouth to pout. She continued grumble, causing everyone to laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the old me teach the little Xiao Xiao in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao finally lifted his head after pinching her for a long while. His eyes looked at Xiao Yan as he asked without any hesitation. Even he wasn\u2019t able to restrain himself when faced with Xiao Xiao, who was like perfect raw jade.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded when he Yao Lao\u2019s suggestion. He had brought Xiao Xiao back to the Falling Star Pavilion to be trained by him No one among those he was acquainted with could surpass Yao Lao\u2019s medicinal refinement skills. It was naturally best for him to personally groom Xiao Xiao.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also understood in his heart that Xiao Xiao\u2019s talent might be extremely attractive, but her talent wouldn\u2019t be enough to cause an expert like Yao Lao to feel anxious. Yao Lao truly regarded Xiao Xiao as his granddaughter and wished she would grow up perfect. This caused Xiao Yan to feel a little moved in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis child has been traveling with you through the wormhole for a couple of days. Let her properly rest first\u2026\u201d Yao Lao lovingly patted Xiao Xiao\u2019s head and handed her back to Cai Lin with some unwillingness. Subsequently, he instructed someone to help Cai Lin and her daughter settle down.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, the both of you should continue chatting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cai Lin was someone who was mindful of others. She was aware that this teacher and disciple needed to speak about something. Hence, she softly spoke to Xiao Yan before leaving slowly with Xiao Xiao.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao withdrew his eyes only after seeing Cai Lin take Xiao Xiao away. He smiled and said, \u201cLittle fellow, you have helped give birth to a good daughter\u2026 however, you being together with Medusa has exceeded my expectation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan spread his hands. The relationship between him and Cai Lin was quite complicated. Who would have imagined that Queen Medusa, who had been chasing Xiao Yan with a murderous intent for many years, would actually become his wife?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have also heard about the matter this time around. Being able to dispatch two Tianzuns is sufficient to show that the Hall of Souls is not fooling around. However, they suffered a great loss this time. The ninth Tianzun was killed on the spot by you, and that fourth Tianzun was beaten half to death before fleeing\u2026\u201d Yao Lao fondled his beard and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHonestly speaking, I do not know what the Hall of Souls is planning to do. This clan has always been mysterious and unfathomable. They definitely carrying out a scheme from the way they are gathering souls\u2026 moreover, from the recent increase of soul gathering, this scheme is likely progressing very quickly. Based on the information that I have obtained, it seems that some big wars have erupted in other parts of the continent outside the Central Plains. The Hall of Souls is likely involved in these wars\u2026\u201d Yao Lao mused.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Wars has erupted across other parts of the continent?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed upon hearing this. He felt a little uneasy. Just what were these fellows from the Hall of Souls planning?</p><br/><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s nodded with a solemn expression. He softly sighed a moment later and changed the topic of conversation. \u201cThere is still half a month left before the spatial trade fair begins. We should also properly prepare during this period of time. Those who are able to participate in the spatial trade fair are all top experts and powerful factions. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame is too attractive. Since we have been able to obtain news about it, other factions will also be aware of it. Hence, we will definitely have to pay a great price in order to compete for the final map fragment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. The Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame was ranked third on the Heavenly Flame Ranking. This rank alone indicated its great strength. Its allure was naturally something that need not be mentioned. Even though it was just a map fragment, its value would be quite frightening. It would not be easy to successfully obtain it from the many competitors.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of what happens, we need to obtain the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. There are four map fragments. Three of them are in your hands. We must obtain the last piece no matter what.\u201d Yao Lao remarked. The Heavenly Flames in the top three spots of the Heavenly Flame Ranking possessed an extremely destructive force. These three types of Heavenly Flames were extremely rare in the world. Even after tens of thousands of years or even hundreds of thousands of years, it would be difficult to form another one. It was even rumored that the world did not dare create too many of the top three Heavenly Flames due to them being overly powerful. Only when one of the Heavenly Flames completely disappeared, would a second flame appear after tens of thousands of years\u2026</p><br/><p>This divine thing was feared by the spirits of the world!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

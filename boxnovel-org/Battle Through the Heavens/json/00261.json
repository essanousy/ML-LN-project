The surrounding space seemed to tremble slightly at this moment. The lazy white clouds in the blue sky were torn into pieces by the domineering forces in the sky.</p><br/><p>In Yan City, everyone repeatedly trembled under these four interacting vast and mighty forces. That terrifying pressure caused people to feel as though they were each carrying a five hundred kilograms heavy stone. Their breathing became somewhat deep and heavy.</p><br/><p>\u201cLu Man, ha ha, it\u2019s unexpected that you would actually be forced into scurrying around randomly. If this was to be conveyed back, you would likely be ridiculed to death by them!\u201d The enormous triangular shaped eyes stared at Xiao Yan and Hai Bo Dong opposite him. The huge mouth of the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 opened and closed, emitting a deafeningly loud laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou bastard Bai Ya. I am carrying someone with me and also don\u2019t wish to wind up fighting them. If I don\u2019t run, should I just foolishly stand there and wait for them to attack?\u201d When the green clothed lady whose body was suspended beside the head of the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 heard his mocking laughter, she could not help but yell furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee.\u201d The \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 smiled and shook his huge tail. His triangle shaped eyes moved. When he glanced at Qing Lin in the chest of the lady whom he addressed as Lu Man, his thunder like voice became much more serious. \u201cIs it really the \u2018Triple Jade-Green Snake Flower Pupils\u2019? \u201c</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, there is nothing wrong with your senses. It really is that!\u201d As she mentioned this, a joy was spread over the forehead of this green clothed lady while she smiled, nodded and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good\u2026\u201d Hearing this, the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 clearly sighed in relief. He once again shifted his gaze toward Xiao Yan and Hai Bo Dong opposite him. After scanning slightly, he exclaimed in shock. He paused on Xiao Yan\u2019s body which was emitting a thick white flame and said with shock \u201cHow unusual. Why do I feel that the Qi on this person seems faintly familiar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou also had this kind of feeling?\u201d The green clothed lady blinked her eyes in surprise. She sized-up Xiao Yan and said, \u201cJust now, I exposed my cover because of the somewhat familiar Qi on his body. However, there are far too many strong people that I have come into contact with. Therefore, I cannot remember just who this Qi is similar to.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe white colored flame on his body should be a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, right? It is just that I am unsure which kind it is. Tsk tsk, what a lucky fellow.\u201d The \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 said in surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it indeed is a type of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. His strength is extremely terrifying. My \u2018Ten-Thousand Wooden Prison\u2019 does not have any effect on him.\u201d The green clothed lady nodded her head and said deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, it has been many years since I came to the Jia Ma Empire. I did not expect that such a strong person had actually appeared.\u201d The \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 was somewhat surprised as he said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, enough of this nonsense. After creating such a huge commotion here, I\u2019m afraid that the people from the Misty Cloud Sect and that old demon from the Jia Ma Empire royalty have already sensed something. If we were to drag on, it would be troublesome once they were to hurry over.\u201d The green clothed lady said deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cOk, I know. What a long-winded woman\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 swung his enormous tail slightly and immediately said somewhat regretfully, \u201cBut how unfortunate. Originally, I wanted to find Queen Medusa to have a competition. Who would have thought that her evolution actually failed. Ah, such a beautiful woman. It was clear that she appeared just for this emperor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Ya, stop having such romantic thoughts. Have you forgotten the terrible state that she beat you into the last time?\u201d The green clothed lady rolled her eyes and helplessly said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, I love her violence.\u201d The \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 shook his huge head and laughed loudly, \u201cAlright. You should bring that girl and leave first. I will block them. Ten minutes later, we will meet at the old place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, be careful. Those two are not simple people.\u201d The green clothed lady nodded her head and reminded. The pair of wings on her back flapped gently and she shot to the distant skyline.</p><br/><p>\u201cRest assured. If we were to compare flying speed, there is no one in the Dou Huang class who can be compared with me.\u201d The \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 waved his tail toward the green clothed lady in the distant and proudly laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to go? Leaving her behind!\u201d Seeing the green clothed lady quickly fleeing, Xiao Yan\u2019s expression sank. He flapped his Purple Cloud Wings gently and his body shot forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, your opponent is me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan who wanted to fly past him from above, the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 laughed. His eight wings flapped together and his huge body instantly appeared on the path that Xiao Yan was flying on. His huge serpent tail was suddenly swung. The terrifying force that it contained actually caused the space to have a sort of distorted feeling.</p><br/><p>Sensing the terrifying strength of the serpent tail, Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed. He did not dare to met it head on. His body swiftly twisted and dodged it. Although he dodged the attack, his aim of giving chase was stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Old Hai, attack!\u201d Xiao Yan cursed softly. As his body avoided the repeated attacks of the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019, he turned his head around and shouted toward Hai Bo Dong.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me block him for a moment!\u201d Hai Bo Dong\u2019s expression was serious as he cried out softly. His hand formed some seals. As his sleeves trembled slightly, cold air suddenly surged out of his body. In an instant, the entire place was completely shrouded by cold air. Due to the increased intensity of the cold air, threads of snow began to descend from the sky. A moment later, wild winds howled. The snow swiftly agglomerated into snow white ice blades. The threads of wild wind gradually turned into a vortex which suddenly expanded. A moment later, the vortex actually expanded until it was over ten meters wide.</p><br/><p>As the wild wind howled, numerous sharp ice blades were shot into the vortex. In an instant, a white colored tornado whose exterior was covered by sharp ice blades appeared out of thin air in the sky.</p><br/><p>By using his own strength to build such a ferocious ice blade storm, a lot of cold sweat began to accumulate on Hai Bo Dong\u2019s forehead despite his strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, move aside!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hai Bo Dong shouted in a low voice. When he saw Xiao Yan swiftly withdrawing to one side, Hai Bo Dong waved his sleeves. An enormous ice blade storm that carried a sharp breaking wind sound, howled as it swept toward the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cHei, the momentum is quite good. However, I am a six star Dou Huang. How can this two star Dou Huang strength of yours compete with me? Ha ha!\u201d Eyeing the ice blade storm that was being swept over, the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 laughed loudly. He swung his huge head and a black colored flame suddenly surged out of his body. After which, it was unceasingly being supplied out before finally agglomerating into an equally large black colored energy \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 on top of his head.</p><br/><p>Swinging his huge tail abruptly, the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 that was completely agglomerated from the strange black colored flame violently shot out from the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019. It carried a force that was quite terrifying and violently collided with the white colored ice blade tornado.</p><br/><p>At the moment of collision, the space when the two came into contact appeared to have shattered and opened tiny black colored crack lines.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two different kinds of terrifying energy, with one being white and the other being black, stood off against each other for a moment before suddenly exploding in the sky. The intense energy explosion sound could still be faintly heard even a kilometer away.</p><br/><p>At the instance when the explosion occurred, a circle of energy ripples spread out from the point of explosion and shook both Hai Bo Dong and the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 at the same time, forcing them to pull back swiftly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, with the way you squander, even if you are a Dou Huang, you could likely only display it a couple of times, no?\u201d Eyeing Hai Bo Dong, whose face had some cold sweat surfacing, the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 laughed loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOctane Blast!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before his laughter completely fell, his huge triangular eyes abruptly shrunk. The dark black scales on his body abruptly and strangely tightened. A layer of faint black colored strange grease seeped out from below the scales and swiftly wrapped the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019s\u2019 body within it.</p><br/><p>At the waist of the huge body of the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019, Xiao Yan\u2019s body suddenly appeared in a flash. His fist that was covered by a thick white flame that abruptly tightened and carried a terrifying force like a burst of lightning when it violently smashed downward. At this moment, that spacious black colored robe on Xiao Yan seemed to have become as tough as steel.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s fist smashed heavily onto the body of the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor'. However, Xiao Yan\u2019s expression became extremely ugly. This was because he had sensed that the body of the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 had suddenly become as greasy as a loach.</p><br/><p>Even though Xiao Yan\u2019s fist smashed onto the serpent, it moved along the layer of greasy film on the beast body and drifted away.</p><br/><p>Although most of the attack from this blow missed, there was still a small portion that was solidly smashed onto the body of the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019. The high temperature contained in the thick white flame immediately caused the small section of serpent scale where the fist had landed to to curl up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss, it\u2019s painful!\u201d The intense pain that was transmitted from his body caused the huge body of the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 to abruptly curl up. The huge tail suddenly swung back and violently smashed on Xiao Yan\u2019s back. Immediately, Xiao Yan became like a rubber ball as he was sent flying.</p><br/><p>\u201cGlug\u2026\u201d The enormous force transmitted from his back caused Xiao Yan to spit out a mouthful of blood. His pair of wings flapped rapidly in order to stabilize his staggering body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, it is after all not a strength that belongs to me. It is extremely awkward controlling it.\u201d Xiao Yan wiped off the bloodstain from the corner of his mouth and laughed bitterly in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Hai Bo Dong flew to Xiao Yan\u2019s side and inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head. His gaze was somewhat anxious as he eyed the distant horizon. During this period of them that the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019 held them off, that green clothed lady had fled until one could not see her shadow.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do? Although he cannot kill us, with his strength it does not seem difficult to hold us off.\u201d Hai Bo Dong laughed bitterly, \u201cThe affinity of this fellow coincidentally restrains mine. The scales all over him have a defence that is frightening. Was it not for you relying on the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 just now, that punch would likely have little effect on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan clenched his teeth tightly, his breathing was a little hurried.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe both of us don\u2019t possess those terrifying Dou Techniques with great destructive power. If we want to defeat him, it would seem a little difficult.\u201d Hai Bo Dong sighed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan remained quiet. The \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 was something that belonged to Yao Lao. Therefore, the extent at which Xiao Yan could control it was far from being as flexible as Yao Lao. Moreover, the Spiritual Strength that had enabled him to be able to fight with a Dou Huang also completely belonged to Yao Lao. All of these were not of related to Xiao Yan. He had only played the part of a transferring point.</p><br/><p>Even the \u2018Octane Blast\u2019 did not have much effect on the \u2018Eight-Winged Black Serpent Emperor\u2019. Then the only hidden card that Xiao Yan was left with was that Di class Dou Technique: Flame Splitting Tsunami!</p><br/><p>Placing his palm gently on his shoulder, Xiao Yan\u2019s finger touched the icy cold black colored huge ruler on his back. However, just as he was preparing to use this last hidden card, the corner of his eye abruptly stopped on the \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 on his left hand. His mind was blank for a moment. After being quiet for a moment, a thought that was somewhat insane quietly began to excitedly rise from the deep regions of his heart without any restraint.</p><br/><p>\u201cPerhaps, this will be even more terrifying\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

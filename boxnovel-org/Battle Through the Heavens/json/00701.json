A faint white-colored smoke was rising from the crimson-colored medicinal cauldron. Finally, it lingered above the chamber and did not scatter\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression was solemn in front of the medicinal cauldron. His eyes were staring intently at the embryonic medicinal pill that was slowly rotating within the jade-green flame inside the medicinal cauldron. A powerful Spiritual Strength was controlling the rise and fall of the temperature before ultimately stabilizing it at a constant temperature.</p><br/><p>Following this warm distillation with a slow flame, a rich medicinal fragrance gradually rose from the cauldron after around half an hour. A slight energy ripple was emitted from the medicinal cauldron before it heavily collided against the walls of the medicinal cauldron, carrying a low and deep clang sound\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan inhaled the rich medicinal fragrance from the medicinal cauldron. A moment later, his eyes were suddenly opened and the cover of the medicinal cauldron automatically opened. The round green medicinal pill inside automatically flew out and accurately landed in Xiao Yan\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan only sighed in relief after sensing the faint remaining warmth that was carried within the medicinal pill. This \u2018Mixed Bone Molding Pill\u2019 might not be considered to be that high of a grade among the tier 6 medicinal pills, but it was a genuine tier 6 medicinal pill regardless of how one put it. Even though Xiao Yan had the help of the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame, he still had quite a high failure rate when refining a medicinal pill of this tier. He had exhausted nearly four sets of medicinal ingredients before he successfully refined one pill...</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stored the \u2018Mixed Bone Molding Pill\u2019 into a jade bottle and stretched his lazy waist. His body shook and a wave of clear cracking sounds appeared from his bones.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao looked at Xiao Yan who had managed to refine successfully after spending an entire night. He slowly said, \u201cThis new \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 that is formed from the merger of the two \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 does indeed possess great might. However, it is also because of this reason that you are unable to control it as smoothly as the way you controlled the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 in the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>Given Yao Lao\u2019s eyesight, he was naturally able to see the parts in which Xiao Yan was lacking after watching him work for an entire night. A couple of the failures in the refinement were because the \u2018Glazed Lotus Heart Flame\u2019 was too powerful. Even a slight overflow of the temperature would cause some of the medicinal ingredients to be completely incinerated.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded upon hearing this. He was also aware of some of the drawbacks of the current \u2018Glaze Lotus Core Flame\u2019. However, he did not have much choice with regards to this. The \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 might be powerful but how could it be as easy to use as one\u2019s own hand?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should practice using this \u2018Glazed Lotus Heart Flame\u2019 more often if you have the chance to in the future. This has quite a great impact on the increased success rate of refining a medicinal pill\u2026\u201d Yao Lao reminded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He nodded once again and stored the crimson medicinal cauldron into his storage ring. He leaped to the ground and smiled as he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. The medicinal pill is successfully refined and should be given to the imperial family. I also possess quite a great interest toward that rank 6 Serene Sea Scaly Beast\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan walked to the door of the chamber once he said this. Yao Lao laughed behind him as his figure gradually turned illusionary before it eventually completely vanished\u2026</p><br/><p>After Xiao Yan exited the chamber, a female servant who was waiting by the side stepped forward and reported to him in a gentle voice. From what she had said, it seemed that Yao Ye had unexpectedly come to the Xiao Mansion early this morning.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe imperial family is actually so impatient\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan was also startled when he heard this. Yao Ye\u2019s character was obviously extremely cool. Otherwise, she would not be chosen by Jia Xingtian to be groomed as the next female emperor. However, it was unexpected that she was also this anxious today. It seemed that they did indeed view this Serene Sea Scaly Beast with extremely great importance\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He increased his pace and entered the hall a moment later only to coincidentally see Xiao Ding and Xiao Li conversing with Yao Ye.</p><br/><p>Yao Ye, who was originally chatting with Xiao Ding and Xiao Li hurriedly stood up when her drifting gaze saw Xiao Yan appearing. She smiled and said to Xiao Yan, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry to come and disturb you so early in the morning\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and waved his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Xiao Yan, may I know\u2026 if that \u2018Mixed Bone Molding Pill\u2019 was successfully refined?\u201d Seeing that Xiao Yan did not open his mouth, Yao Ye hesitated for a moment before she could not help opening her mouth to inquire.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan glanced at Yao Ye and saw the anxiety on her face. He immediately grinned and nodded slightly. He said, \u201cFortunately, I have lived up to such expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Ye immediately dropped the large stone in her heart when she heard these words from Xiao Yan. Her beautiful face immediately revealed a moving smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved his hand and a jade bottle appeared in his palm.. It was immediately randomly tossed by him to Yao Ye.</p><br/><p>Yao Ye was terribly shocked when she saw the jade bottle being tossed over. She hurriedly received it and stared at Xiao Yan with a rebuking gaze. He even dared to randomly toss such a high-tier medicinal pill. This fellow...</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the \u2018Mixed Bone Molding Pill\u2019?\u201d Yao Ye carefully tilted the jade bottle and poured the \u2018Mixed Bone Molding Pill,\u2019 which had an unusual medicinal scent into her delicate hand. Yao Ye was somewhat amazed when she spoke. Although the imperial family had an extremely rich collection, even she had not seen many tier 6 medicinal pills.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan nodded his head and said with a beaming face. \u201cHowever, the medicinal strength of this kind of medicinal pill is far too overbearing. Therefore, only a Magical Beast can consume it. Moreover, this also requires the alchemist to specially activate it in order for the medicinal strength to be completely activated\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Ye was also startled when she heard that this medicinal pill actually required a special method to activate it. Her bright eyes immediately looked to Xiao Yan and embarrassingly said, \u201cSince it is like this, I\u2019m afraid that we will have to trouble mister Xiao Yan again\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am fine with it since I am able to see that mysterious Serene Sea Scaly Beast of the imperial family.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. He got up and walked toward the door. Yao Ye hurriedly followed behind him with a joyful face.</p><br/><p>The two of them had just left the Xiao Mansion when they saw Zi Yan who was supporting her little head with her hands as she sat on the stairs feeling extremely bored. She immediately leaped up happily when she saw Xiao Yan. After which, she was glued to him like a sticky candy.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was also helpless in the face of this girl who would stick to people. Medusa had for some unknown reason disappeared during these two days. Without her company, Zi Yan had become extremely bored. Therefore, Xiao Yan could only bring her along.</p><br/><p>The luxurious carriage of Yao Ye was stopped outside the entrance of the Xiao Mansion. Xiao Yan unceremoniously pulled Zi Yan and boarded it. After which, under Yao Ye\u2019s command, the skillful driver gave an acknowledgement before directing the snow-white wildebeasts to rush to the interior of the imperial city.</p><br/><p>After around half an hour\u2019s journey, the carriage successfully passed through the imperial city\u2019s tight defenses. Xiao Yan and Zi Yan did not pause for long after they alighted from the carriage as they followed Yao Ye swiftly toward the enormous back mountain within the imperial city. They finally stopped at an enormous large lake on the peak of the mountain.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Yan arrived at this place, he saw that Jia Xingtian had already been waiting there. The latter also discovered Xiao Yan and Zi Yan at the same time and hurriedly stepped forward to greet them.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, we have troubled mister Xiao Yan\u2026\u201d Jia Xingtian courteously spoke to Xiao Yan with a smile. His tightened heart also relaxed greatly when he saw the slight joy on Yao Ye\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yann waved his hand and laughed slightly, \u201cAll of us are merely getting what we need\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Ye swiftly stepped forward and carefully handed the jade bottle to Jia Xingtian. After which, she also mentioned the matter of the medicinal pill needed to be activated.</p><br/><p>Jia Xingtian once again cupped his hands toward Xiao Yan after hearing this. He spoke courteously, \u201cIn that case, I\u2019m afraid that we will have to trouble mister Xiao Yan again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. His gaze swept toward the enormous lake. He could vaguely sense a powerful aura hidden at the bottom of the lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? This lake actually has a large snake. It\u2019s strength also appears quite good\u2026\u201d During the time that Xiao Yan was sensing it, Zi Yan by the side suddenly cried out in surprise.</p><br/><p>Jia Xingtian and Yao Ye were startled when they heard Zi Yan open her mouth. Their gazes immediately looked at this jade-carving-like little girl with surprise. It was already extremely difficult to sense the hidden aura within such a deep lake. It was unexpected that this cute little girl was actually able to describe the shape of the thing hidden in it. How could this not surprise them?</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan by the side was not surprised at Zi Yan\u2019s performance. The latter was actually also a Magical Beast whose rank was likely quite high. It was not overly strange that she could sense the Magical Beast that was hidden within the lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cJia Lao, please call the Serene Sea Scaly Beast\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Xingtian hurriedly nodded when he heard this. His body flashed and appeared on the top of the lake. Both of his feet landed on the water before immediately penetrating the water. A powerful Dou Qi erupted into it...</p><br/><p>Following the pouring in of Dou Qi, the calm lake\u2019s surface immediately seemed to look as though it was boiling as it formed a countless number of bubbles.</p><br/><p>With the bubbling of the lake\u2019s surface, Xiao Yan, who was by the shore, also clearly sensed it. A powerful aura gradually surged out from under the lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the surface of the lake started bubbling more aggressively, a large water pillar suddenly erupted from under the lake before transforming into water that scattered all over the sky that quickly rained down\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d</p><br/><p>The water pillar shot to the sky and the unusual, low, deep roar suddenly erupted from the lake. The enormous body that appeared immediately occupied half of the lake.</p><br/><p>The Magical Beast that appeared in front of Xiao Yan had a size that did not lose to that of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 combat shape in the past. The meandering enormous body was covered with deep-blue scales that reflected a dense cold glint under the sunlight. That enormous head possessed a blue screw horn. Its lantern-like large eyes were quite frightening to look at.</p><br/><p>The surrounding air immediately became much wetter when this beast appeared. Clearly, this enormous beast should be the mysterious guardian beast of the Jia Ma Empire\u2019s imperial family, the Serene Sea Scaly Beast!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

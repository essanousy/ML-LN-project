It is formed deep underground and has experienced the polishing, fusion, pressure, and carving from the planet\u2019s flame\u2026 It forms a spirit in ten years, takes shape in a hundred years and turns into a lotus in a thousand years. When it is completely formed, its color would slant toward the greenish side and the lotus core would form a cluster of green flame, named as \u201cGreen Lotus Flame\u2019 or \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019. The strength of this flame is unpredictable. When it is near volcanoes, it can cause volcanoes to erupt, forming a mayira; destructive strength.</p><br/><p>This information swiftly flashed in Xiao Yan\u2019s mind. A wild joy instantly covered his face. Shaking his body, Xiao Yan pulled away from the Flame Spirit Serpent as his eyes stared intently at the large rich green light a short distance away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss\u2026\u201d Beside him, a sharp sound was emitted from the Flame Spirit Serpent. Xiao Yan turned around and found that within this huge beast's eyes, there was a faint fear as it stared at the cluster of green light. Its huge body also shrank and trembled.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the Flame Spirit Serpent\u2019s action, Xiao Yan licked his lips and said excitedly in his heart, \u201cTeacher! Have we found it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, it looks like it. How unexpected, we really found a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019... although the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 is only ranked nineteenth on the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 ranking, it is the perfect flame for you now. After all, the few things that I have prepared for you can only increase the chances of success for absorbing \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 that are ranked sixteenth and below. Thus, this \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 is suitable!\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s laughter held signs of being pleased. There was finally the first reward for these few years of hard work.</p><br/><p>Inhaling a few long excited breaths, Xiao Yan could not wait any longer as he said, \u201cShall we go over and take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, let\u2019s go and take a look. I will increase the degree of protection!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head. His gaze glanced at the Two-Headed Flame Spirit Serpent that was so afraid that it did not dare take another step forward. Xiao Yan curled his lips and kicked his feet within the magma. Like a small fish in a lake, his body swiftly swam toward the region that was covered by the green colored light.</p><br/><p>As the distance between his body and the green colored flame decreased, Xiao Yan could clearly feel that the temperature around him had suddenly increased.</p><br/><p>Closing his somewhat dry lips tightly, Xiao Yan clenched his teeth and took another step. His body finally charged into the region covered by the green colored light.</p><br/><p>As his body entered the green colored light, he realized that it was not as hot as he had imagined. Instead, the surrounding temperature had strangely decreased drastically.</p><br/><p>Regarding this somewhat strange phenomenon, Xiao Yan\u2019s face was completely stunned. A moment later, he finally recovered as his gaze hurriedly swept across his surroundings. Finally, he was looking at the green colored lotus at the middle.</p><br/><p>The green colored lotus had eight leaves. These eight green colored leaves were like the most perfect green jade that was naturally formed. At a glance, it appeared crystal clear, giving people a desire to hold and not release it.</p><br/><p>Within the lotus, there seemed to be a small lotus platform that was around two to three feet. A small fluorescent light was emitted from some small holes on the lotus platform. This light appeared to be coming from lotus seeds that were formed from the purest fire type energy agglomerating together.</p><br/><p>On the lower portion of the green colored lotus, there was a very narrow and long stem and root. The stem and root were covered with extremely tiny tentacles. As these tentacles were swaying around, Xiao Yan could clearly feel their greed, unrestrainedly absorbing the surrounding wild fire type energy.</p><br/><p>This green colored lotus was simply suspended in this never ending magma. It was like a duckweed on the vast ocean, wandering everywhere. If Xiao Yan did not have the Flame Spirit Serpent to lead the way, he would not have been able to search for this comparatively small green colored lotus in this enormous crypt with his ability, even if he were to search till death\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful. Don\u2019t get caught by those tentacles. Otherwise the Dou Qi in your body will be completely absorbed in the blink of an eye.\u201d Yao Lao warned, causing Xiao Yan to quickly abandon his thought of going closer to take a look.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Be careful as you go over. Looking at the shape of the lotus, it obviously had lived through many thousands of years. It should have already agglomerated and formed the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019.\u201d Yao Lao said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d At this moment, Xiao Yan\u2019s body was so excited that it trembled. His crossed his hands and bafflingly prayed. He then swallowed his saliva as his body gradually swam toward the green colored lotus.</p><br/><p>As his distance from the green colored lotus grew closer, Xiao Yan could feel its beauty. This kind of thing that was so close to perfection could only be created from being honed by nature for a long period of time.</p><br/><p>Carefully avoiding the swaying tentacles, Xiao Yan slowly arrived at a spot above the green lotus. His excited gaze swept through its interior and his body suddenly stiffened\u2026</p><br/><p>In the middle of the small lotus platform within the lotus, there was a small hole around the size of a fist. However, at this moment\u2026 that hole was empty!</p><br/><p>Seeing that empty lotus core, Xiao Yan\u2019s head immediately became dim. He muttered, \u201cHow can this be? Why isn\u2019t it there? From the shape of this green lotus, it should have formed the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 long ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it not here?\u201d The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth twitched. He was briefly silent. Suddenly, he began yelling loudly at the lotus platform. His young and handsome face appeared a little hideous at the moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuiet! Calm down now!\u201d Just as Xiao Yan lost his sense of reasoning in anger, Yao Lao\u2019s deep cry appeared like a clock chime in his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there isn\u2019t, then we\u2019ll just have to continue to look for it. The Dou Qi continent is so big. It\u2019s not like the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is only present here!\u201d At the space where Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulder was at, Yao Lao\u2019s head that was formed by the cohesion of the thick white flames reprimanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut\u2026 but I spent so much effort\u2026 do I just end up going back empty handed?\u201d Xiao Yan violently swung his head and said in an extremely dissatisfied manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this world, there are thousands and thousands of people persevering and searching for a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. But after paying the ultimate price, they never even get to see what a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 looks like. Many people would envy you for being able to reach this place.\u201d Yao Lao softly comforted. He turned around, eyed the empty lotus core and sighed gently in his heart. It was a lie if he said that it was not disappointing. The \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 that he thought he could easily obtain had suddenly bafflingly grown wings and escaped. If he did not have such a strong mental strength, he might have already lose his temper.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? What is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>As his gaze swept the lotus platform in detail, Yao Lao suddenly let out a surprised sound. He waved the hand that was covered in a thick white flame. Instantly, a seven colored light shot out from the lotus platform and fell into Yao Lao\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this thing?\u201d Tilting his head in a listless manner, Xiao Yan eyed the thing in Yao Lao\u2019s hand. He stilled slightly and said in a stunned voice, \u201cScale?\u201d</p><br/><p>The thing in Yao Lao\u2019s hand was about half a palm in size. Its entire body was covered in seven colors. Glancing at it, the luster from the seven colors was beautiful and colorful.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026 a Seven-Colored Snake Scale?\u201d Yao Lao squinted his eyes as a cold smile was lifted from the corner of his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven-Colored Snake Scale?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wondering why there isn\u2019t any \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 in the lotus. It was actually taken by someone else.\u201d Yao Lao threw the Seven-Colored Snake Scale toward Xiao Yan and laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan received the scale and felt the spot on his hand which came into contact with it turn cold. Waves of cold air continued to enter his body. If Xiao Yan did not have the protection from Yao Lao\u2019s \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019, he would likely not even dare to touch this thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid the owner of this scale take the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 away?\u201d Xiao Yan said with a frown as he tightly held the Seven-Colored Scale.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is only one person in the entire Tager Desert who possesses the Seven-Colored Scale. That is the Queen Medusa from the Snake-People Race. Looks like the mysterious Qi Qing Lin sensed from half a year ago should be that of Queen Medusa\u2019s.\u201d Yao Lao voiced his thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh. So what if it is her? It has been half a year. The \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 must have been absorbed by her\u2026\u201d Thinking of this possibility, Xiao Yan immediately said dispiritedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have really become muddle headed\u2026 Queen Medusa has the Snake-People blood flowing in her body. She is naturally inclined toward the dark and cold. Absorbing the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019? Has she become tired of living?\u201d Hearing this, Yao Lao threw a look of disdain at Xiao Yan as he reprimanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince her attributes clash with the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, then did she have nothing better to do then to come here and snatch the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019? Moreover, Qing Lin had said that she was even injured when she took the \u2018Heavenly Flame' away? Why would she spend so much effort if she did not have a reason?\u201d Xiao Yan laughed bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat may be so\u2026\u201d Yao Lao waved his hand and voiced his thoughts, \u201cLooks like we still have to make a trip to the inner regions of the Tager Desert. I don\u2019t know what exactly she wants to do but I can definitely tell you that she would not absorb the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. Thus\u2026 we might have a chance to get the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 again.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and find Queen Medusa to snatch the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019? She\u2019s of the Dou Huang class. Back then, even that Ice Huang, whose name shook the Jia Ma Empire, ended up in that miserable state because of her. For us to go and search\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan rubbed his forehead and smiled bitterly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaving a target is better than us randomly running around to search. Moreover\u2026 the one who would fight at that time would be me, not you. Although the fierce name of Queen Medusa is renowned throughout the Dou Qi continent, I am not afraid of her.\u201d Yao Lao curled his lips and said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan bitterly smiled and could only sigh and nod his head. Immediately, his head turned with his body and prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, what are you doing?\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s action, Yao Lao appeared somewhat stunned as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cGoing back\u2026 Should I stay here and eat magma?\u201d Xiao Yan impolitely replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you fool.\u201d Hearing the words, Yao Lao was immediately angered and knocked Xiao Yan\u2019s head a few times. His finger pointed to the green colored lotus and furiously said, \u201cThis thing is a unique treasure that requires a thousand years in order to take shape. You child want to abandon it here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Xiao Yan blinked his eyes in shock. He turned around and eyed the green colored lotus and asked in a confused state, \u201cWhat use does this thing have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Rolling his eyes, Yao Lao had difficulty swallowing these words of Xiao Yan's. He drew his beard and said irritably, \u201cThis green colored lotus platform is formed from the agglomeration of the planet\u2019s flame for a thousand years. As long as you remove it and sit on it to train in the future, your training speed may not be able to increase by ten times but an increase of three to four times should be possible. Moreover, you can activate it using your Dou Qi when you meet an enemy and release the Core Flame contained within it. If you meet a person at the Dou Ling level, you may not be able to defeat him but you should meet no resistance when fleeing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s the lotus seeds in the lotus platform. This Core-Fire Lotus Seed that is known as the essence of flame spirits is something that requires a hundred years to form. If you go out and shout that you have a Core-Fire Lotus Seed, I dare to guarantee that even a Dou Huang would use all his might to exchange with you. Of course\u2026 this is excluding those who prefer a more direct method like killing and robbing you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you take any of these things out, you would turn the Jia Ma Empire into an upheaval. You child dare to refuse it?\u201d Having spoken until this point, Yao Lao spoke as if Xiao Yan was completely useless.</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d Hearing the mouthwatering explanation of Yao Lao, Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes grew increasingly bright. By the time Yao Lao had finished, Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes were fiery red as he pounced onto the lotus platform.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, consider all this all interest\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

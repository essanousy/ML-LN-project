They immediately fell deep into thought.</p><br/><p>Joy surged into Xiao Yan\u2019s heart as he observed the two people who were deep in thought. He was merely asking randomly. Yet, he ended up seeing the expression of the faces of the two of them. It seemed that they were not completely unaware about this thing.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan turned his head and exchanged looks with the Little Fairy Doctor by his side. He discovered that despite the latter\u2019s calmness, there was a faint joy within her eyes. They did not manage to obtain even the slightest bit of information regarding the \u2018Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva\u2019 during their journey. Unexpectedly, they might be able to learn something after they arrived here.</p><br/><p>\u201c... according to what the old me knows, there is a kind of mysterious ancient tree within a sparsely populated mountain. It is named the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree. The rhizome of this tree, buried deep underground, will gradually form a thick heart-shaped item that will possess a mysterious effect. It slowly agglomerates over the years. Hence, there are people who call it the Bodhisattva Heart. However, normally speaking, it would require the accumulation of over a thousand years for the Bodhisattva Ancient Tree to form a Bodhisattva Heart. The Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva is a mysterious item that is secreted from the surface of this Bodhisattva Heart\u2026\u201d Old Yan finally spoke after musing for awhile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes brightened slightly when he heard this. This was the first time he had heard any information relating to the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva was consumed, it possessed the effect of transforming one\u2019s body and improving one\u2019s constitution. It was extremely mysterious\u2026 as for the Bodhisattva Heart, it was able to gradually replace the heart in one\u2019s body. That way, one would be able to keep one\u2019s life even if one\u2019s heart suffered a fatal blow. Moreover, the strength that this Bodhisattva Heart could provide to a person far exceed that of that person\u2019s previous heart. Of course, the most important thing is that this item\u2026 was able to repeatedly nourish one\u2019s soul and gradually strengthen it\u2026 Therefore, it held an allure that any alchemist would find difficult to resist.\u201d Old Yan\u2019s voice was slightly heated while he spoke. Clearly, he felt an attraction to this so-called Bodhisattva Heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cReplace a person\u2019s heart? Strengthen one\u2019s soul?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily felt his mouth turn dry aftering hearing the unbelievable mysterious effects despite his calmness. This Bodhisattva Heart\u2026 was really too frightening no? The strength of one\u2019s Spiritual Strength had an extremely crucial position to an alchemist. An alchemist\u2019s future achievement was mostly determined by the strength of their spirit. Normally speaking, one\u2019s soul would only become more solidified and stronger when one advanced one\u2019s level. No matter how one trained, one\u2019s spirit would remain quiet during ordinary times and wouldn\u2019t be strengthened by even a little.</p><br/><p>The reason Xiao Yan was able to possess such achievements at such an age was mostly because his spirit was a little stronger than ordinary people since he was young. If it was not for this reason, Yao Lao, who was hidden within the ring, would not have revealed himself back in Wu Tan City. He would also not spend so much effort to groom Xiao Yan from a useless young master of a small clan to this genuinely strong person who had shocked and awed an empire.</p><br/><p>Therefore, saying that Xiao Yan\u2019s current achievements were mostly because of his Spiritual Strength, that was stronger than an ordinary person, was not some nonsense.</p><br/><p>Yet, this Bodhisattva Heart actually possessed this kind of nourishment and spirit strengthening effect. In other words, it meant that whoever obtained it would likely have gather unmeasurable achievements in the future. This point was something that even Xiao Yan did not doubt\u2026</p><br/><p>There were natural born geniuses and there were acquired geniuses. The acquired geniuses molded from the Bodhisattva Heart might attain more frightening achievements.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe old me has seen some ancient books that came from a distant past back then that said that there had once been an elite Dou Sheng known as Puti Zi (Puti for the word Bodhisattva) thousands of years ago. This elite Dou Sheng had swallowed a Bodhisattva Heart\u2026 ke ke, but the old me does not know whether this is true. After all that era was too long ago\u2026\u201d Old Yan smiled. From his words, he did not seem to pay much attention to it. Dou Sheng. That thing was really too distant. It was rumored that an expert at that class could cause mountains and rivers to collapse or space to shatter by simply raising his hand. That kind of great strength was something that an ordinary expert would have difficulty imagining.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan emitted a \u2018tsk tsk\u2019 sigh from his mouth. However, he similarly did not place the other party\u2019s words in his heart. He had never believed that any natural spiritual object could truly allow a person to reach the Dou Sheng class. That class was something that one was unable to rely on any external objects to reach. All one could do was rely on one\u2019s luck and potential\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIn this way, this Bodhisattva Heart could be considered a mysterious object\u2026\u201d Owner Yao sighed and gently smiled. Although she had heard of the Bodhisattva Heart, she did not know about the details that Old Yan had spoke of.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Old Yan know where this Bodhisattva Tree is?\u201d Xiao Yan slowly recovered and asked another question.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, mister Yan really knows how to joke. This Bodhisattva Ancient Tree could likely be considered as rare an existence as a phoenix feather and unicorn horn even in the entire Dou Qi continent. It is likely that the old me would not have lived until today if I was aware of it\u2026\u201d Old Yan involuntarily laughed when he heard this.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was also somewhat embarrassed when he heard Old Yan\u2019s response. He was indeed a little hasty in asking this. Forget about the other party not knowing about it, even if he did know, how would it be possible for him to reveal this secret that could be considered priceless?</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the looks of it, it is difficult to obtain that Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan sighed somewhat regretfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is just the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, it is not as difficult as what mister Yan imagines\u2026\u201d Old Yan laughed when he heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does Old Yan mean?\u201d Xiao Yan hurriedly asked while feeling startled.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, don\u2019t misunderstand, our Thousand Medicinal Shop will definitely not have the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. However, I have heard there is coincidentally an item in the large-scale auction that is held by the Black Emperor Sect this time around.\u201d Old Yan smiled as he vaguely spoke.</p><br/><p>A wild joy suddenly surged from the eyes of Xiao Yan and the Little Fairy Doctor when they heard these words. It was unexpected that the thing that they were unable to find for such a long time would actually appear in this place. They were indeed correct to have come to this Black Emperor City!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis news is something that I have acquired through some channels and should be true. However, it is likely that it will be very difficult for you to obtain this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva from the auction\u2026\u201d Old Yan voiced his thoughts. \u201cAlthough the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva effects are far inferior compared to the Bodhisattva Heart, there are still many factions and experts who covet it. This is because it is rumored that as long as one obtains some of the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, one would be able to obtain information regarding the Bodhisattva Heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBodhisattva Heart?\u201d Shock surfaced within Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes when he heard this. He immediately frowned and said, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that one would be able to obtain the information of the Bodhisattva Heart by just obtaining the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although no one knew whether the information related to the Bodhisattva Heart was true, the allure of a Dou Sheng was too frightening. Even if there was only a one in a thousand chance, it was likely that it would attract a countless number of envious eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, this is something that the old me is not certain of. I cannot ascertain whether this information is true. After all, no one knows if this is news that the Black Emperor Sect purposefully spread in order to advertise their auction. The old me has seen many such tactics.\u201d Old Yan shook his head as he replied.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. These tactics of auctions were extremely common. However, regardless of whether that Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva was related to the Bodhisattva Heart, he must obtain it in order to help the Little Fairy Doctor control the \u2018Woeful Poison Body\u2019...</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Yan, thank you very much for telling me this\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan cupped his hand to Old Yan and spoke with a courteous smile. He made a decision in his heart and did not stay much longer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is mister Yan saying? You have suffered a loss by using a Dou Spirit Pill to exchange for these three medicinal ingredients. Treat this as additional reimbursement.\u201d Old Yan smiled while he responded. He was quite satisfied with Xiao Yan polite attitude. Young people these days were unavoidably haughty once they possessed some strength. The impression Xiao Yan gave him was quite good. Otherwise, given his character, he would not be in the mood to reveal so much secret information.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, this information is sufficient to make up for one Dou Spirit Pill.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and replied. This conversation with Old Yan allowed him to gain a rough understanding of the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva, something he was completely ignorant of previously. It also allowed him to gain knowledge of the mysterious Bodhisattva Heart. The importance of this information was not inferior to that of a Dou Spirit Pill in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI still have some matters to attend to today and shall take my leave. If I have the opportunity in the future, I will come and trouble the two of you again\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan once again cupped his hands to Old Yan and Owner Yao. After which, he ceased staying any longer. He turned his body around and headed down the stairs while the Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan followed close behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Yan, you should be careful of that Qi Shan if you wish to stay in the city\u2026\u201d Owner Yao suddenly spoke when Xiao Yan was about to descend the stairs.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your reminder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan paused his footsteps, waved to the two of them and laughed. He slowly descended the stairs and disappeared from the sight of Owner Yao and Old Yan.</p><br/><p>Old Yan slowly withdrew his gaze after seeing the backs of Xiao Yan\u2019s group disappear. He shook his head and said, \u201cLooks like he possesses great interest for that Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. However, there are far too many large factions that are also interested in this thing. Those two simple words, \u2018Dou Sheng,\u2019 are enough to cause many people to go crazy\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough this person is young, his strength is not weak. Moreover, the little purple-haired girl and the white-clothed lady beside him should also not be ordinary people. The Qi Method I practice is unusually sensitive to this kind of thing. The pressure that those two people gave me earlier was not the least bit inferior to this mister Yan\u2026\u201d Owner Yao shook her head. She muttered with a gentle smile, \u201cPerhaps, he might really be able to successfully obtain it\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

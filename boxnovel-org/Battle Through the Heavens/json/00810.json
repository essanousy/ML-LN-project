This caused the interior of Xiao Yan\u2019s entire body to appear to be grilled. However, it was fortunate that the \u2018Glazed Lotus Heart Flame\u2019 had been completely refined by Xiao Yan. The high temperature that was released did not adversely affect Xiao Yan. Otherwise, no one else would dare allow a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 to burn without care in their body.</p><br/><p>A dark-black energy line was rolling intensely like a small snake within that cluster of jade-green flame. Following each rotation, the dark-black color surrounding its body would scatter a little while being grilled by the \u2018Glazed Lotus Heart Flame\u2019.</p><br/><p>Although this kind of scattering speed was extremely slow, the dark-black color would sooner or later be completely incinerated into nothingness since it was not supported by any supplements. As long as the black color that contained an intense poison was removed, the pure Dou Qi that was contained in this \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 would be easily absorbed by Xiao Yan. Moreover, it would become a nourishing substance that would allow Xiao Yan\u2019s strength to improve.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mind was focused on this thread of dark-black poison as his heart emitted a cold laugh. Given his current strength, he really did not dare to provoke that \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019. However, such a tiny thread of poison line without any source supporting it from behind actually dared to randomly move around? It seemed that it really thought the \u2018Glazed Lotus Heart Flame\u2019 within his body, that was formed from two \u2018Heavenly Flames,\u2019 did not possess much threat.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s attention was focused on the dark-black poison line\u2019s color, which was gradually turning pale. He also possessed some understanding of this so-called \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019. This thing was indeed as the Little Fairy Doctor had described. It was extremely dark and poisonous. With his current Dou Huang strength, it was indeed extremely difficult to remove. However, by looking at what the \u2018Glazed Lotus Heart Flame\u2019 was currently doing, he was not totally without the ability to resist this so-called \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019.</p><br/><p>The \u2018Glazed Lotus Heart Flame\u2019 formed from the combination of two \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 was able to refine the poison of this \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019. Although the speed of this refinement was extremely slow and its target was merely a tiny poison line, this \u2018Glazed Lotus Heart Flame\u2019 was at the very least able to refine it!</p><br/><p>Hence, Xiao Yan\u2019s heart quietly made a conjecture that if another \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was to merge with his \u2018Glazed Lotus Heart Flame\u2019, attempting to refine the entire \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 might not be too difficult!</p><br/><p>Of course\u2026 the degree of difficulty in attempting to merge another \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was not any less than finding an elite Dou Zun to lend a hand and remove the poison. This Dou Qi continent was so huge. Yet, a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was very rare. Finding it was an extremely lucky thing. Moreover, even if one found it, attempting to refine it was extremely difficult. Additionally\u2026 a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was not something that was only used by an alchemist. If those experts who practiced fire affinity Dou Qi as well as those who used similar tactics were able to refine it, they would be able to use it. Hence, there were many experts who had the ability to refine a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 on the Dou Qi continent. Who did not covet it?</p><br/><p>Once word of a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 spread, it was likely that it would invite experts from all directions with the aim of snatching it. It would be even more difficult to successfully obtain the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 from these experts.</p><br/><p>Back then, Xiao Yan had spent nearly an entire year within the Jia Nan Academy in order to obtain the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019. Only then did he manage to obtain the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 by using the opportunity of the big battle between the Jia Nan Academy and the experts from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. Moreover, this was after he had undergone a life and death struggle\u2026</p><br/><p>Hence, the difficulty of finding a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 and merging it would not be any easier than looking for an elite Dou Zun...</p><br/><p>Of course, if it was a third kind of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, the interior of Xiao Yan\u2019s body did indeed possess one. The \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 that Yao Lao had left behind. However, this \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 possessed Yao Lao\u2019s spiritual imprint. Unless Yao Lao\u2019s spirit was completely destroyed, one had to first remove the spiritual imprint of Yao Lao in order to merge it. This was naturally something impossible for Xiao Yan. He was hoping to use this \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 to sense whether Yao Lao was alive or dead.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao had said that Xiao Yan should refine and merge the \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 if the fire seal on his forehead disappeared, and the fire seal was still present despite it not emitting any heat. Moreover, given Xiao Yan\u2019s character, it was likely that he would have difficulty swallowing and refining this flame without feeling bad even after the fire seal on his forehead disappeared. It was for no other reason than that the situation he was most worried about would have occurred when it came to that point\u2026</p><br/><p>The color of the \u2018Demon Black Spot\u2019 within the jade-green flame had become much paler while these thoughts lingered in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart. He could faintly see the thick, pure liquid-like Dou Qi within it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed worthy of being a sinister thing gathered by all of the Dou Qi in an elite Dou Zong for it to be actually able to endure this long against a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019...\u201d Xiao Yan helplessly sighed as he observed the black poison line that still remained. A thought appeared in his mind and the cluster of jade-green flame suddenly became much brighter. The hot temperature also grew.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was unaware of how long this extremely slow refinement continued. All he knew was that almost two-thirds of the Dou Qi within his body had already disappeared in order to refine this \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 line. From this, it was possible to see just how troublesome the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 was. A mere thread had already turned Xiao Yan into this state\u2026</p><br/><p>That fiercely churning jade-green flame suddenly revealed a pure, powerful Dou Qi while he was shaking his head and sighing in his heart. Xiao Yan\u2019s spirit was suddenly braced. His mind moved and saw that the originally dark-black poison line within the flame had already lost its dark-black color at this moment. Replacing it was an almost invisible color. There was pure Dou Qi slowly flowing within. This Dou Qi was originally filled with poison. However, after the refinement of the \u2018Glazed Lotus Heart Flame\u2019 over such a long period of time, the impurities within it were completely expelled. Only the purest Dou Qi remained. As long as it was someone who could endure it, one would be able to absorb such an energy without any side effects\u2026</p><br/><p>The jade-green flame slowly disappeared. However, as a precaution, there was still a cluster floating by the side, awaiting Xiao Yan\u2019s order at any moment.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s consciousness carefully moved forward before gently touching the pure Dou Qi. After finding nothing wrong, he slowly invaded it with his consciousness.</p><br/><p>The entry of his consciousness was almost unhindered. The instant he entered, Xiao Yan obtained authority over this pure Dou Qi. He forcefully suppressed the joy within his heart. His consciousness moved, and he directed this pure Dou Qi along the route of the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 Qi Method. It swiftly began to circulate\u2026</p><br/><p>The circulating speed became faster following the increase in the intensity of the pure Dou Qi cycle. In the end, it appeared like an energy hurricane within his body as it carried a strange whistling sound.</p><br/><p>This kind of energy hurricane did not bring about any discomfort to Xiao Yan. Instead, thick liquid droplets of of pure Dou Qi scattered wherever the energy hurricane passed. An extremely comfortable feeling spread out from deep within Xiao Yan\u2019s bones wherever that pure Dou Qi dripped. This caused him to involuntarily let out a groan\u2026</p><br/><p>The hurricane arrived quickly and disappeared quickly. It slowly vanished after thirty plus drops of thick liquid Dou Qi were scattered. The pure Dou Qi gradually became pale. It spread all over Xiao Yan\u2019s body before finally dispersing.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes were tightly shut while he was in the rock pool. The water in the pool had already fallen from his shoulders to his waist. Moreover the black poison water seemed like boiling water as numerous bubbles appeared. Each time a bubble burst, it emitted a dense poison fog.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor stood prettily by the side of the rock pool. She had already put on her garments. Her pretty eyes that were studying the black water within the pool as she displayed a helpless expression. It was unexpected that the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 within Xiao Yan\u2019s body was actually this terrifying. The temperature that it emitted when it was refining the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 line had boiled this pool of valuable poison water, causing some of it to evaporate.</p><br/><p>In the pool, the body of Xiao Yan, who had his eyes tightly shut, trembled slightly as Little Fairy Doctor felt somewhat helpless. His eyes immediately shook as they slowly opened.</p><br/><p>A wave of powerful aura, that was a little stronger than earlier, suddenly expanded after Xiao Yan opened his eyes. It created a five-foot-tall wave in the pool.</p><br/><p>The spreading aura slowly shrank back a moment later. After which, it completely re-entered Xiao Yan\u2019s body. A glow flickered within his eyes as his aura was gradually restrained.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor felt some joy when she sensed Xiao Yan\u2019s somewhat powerful aura. She revealed a slight smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s toes pressed on the bottom of the pool. He borrowed the water\u2019s slight buoyant force to leap up in a supple manner. His feet landed beside the rock pool as he awkwardly smiled at the Little Fairy Doctor.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor hurriedly shifted her eyes away when she saw Xiao Yan leap out of the pool. Her mouth hurriedly scolded, \u201cYou, why aren\u2019t you putting on your clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was embarrassed to discover that his entire body was naked. He let out a dry laugh, and hurriedly took out some clothes from his storage ring before pulling them onto his body in a chaotic manner.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor only turned her eyes back after Xiao Yan had finished putting on his clothes. Her delicate hand pulled back her long white hair that had drifted over her forehead. Her face still revealed some remnant redness. However, moment later she steadied her mind. Her pretty eyes observed Xiao Yan\u2019s body before she curiously asked, \u201cHow much did your strength increase after refining that thread of \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 line that tried to escape?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sensed himself for a moment before laughing, \u201cNot much. Currently, I am merely at the peak of a two star Dou Huang.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is sufficient\u2026 advancing too quickly is not a good thing. In any case, the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 is in your body. Once you have the ability in the future, you can completely refine it. At that time, your strength will greatly soar.\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor laughed. The smile on her face seemed to appear more often when the two of them were alone together.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He clearly understood just how difficult it was to raise one\u2019s strength by one star at the Dou Huang class. Many people had difficulty achieving an advancement even after training for a year. Therefore, increasing his strength by one star after refining a thread of \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 line had already exceeded his expectations.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if I can reach the peak of the Dou Huang class if I completely refine it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s hand rubbed the \u2018Demon Poison Spot\u2019 on his chest as he quietly laughed in his heart. Suddenly, he felt as though he did not despise or resist this thing as much as he had before\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

That stacking mountain range that extended endlessly was sufficient to allow one to feel the different wild atmosphere of this Beast Region.</p><br/><p>Although the Beast Region is known for its hundred thousand large mountains, this was merely a rough estimate. If one was to really count them, it would definitely far exceed this number. These mountains spread into the distance where a human strength could not reach. Following the flow of time, countless of treasures had also been left behind in this endless mountain range, waiting for someone with the affinity to open them.</p><br/><p>The ancient remains had appeared in the Bone Mountain Range of the Beast Region this time around. It was quite renown within the Beast Region. This was because this mountain range possess a sea of bones that caused one to be stunned. Countless number of beast bones were thrown in this place. These beast bones would gradually unleash some of the unique beast strength within them following the flow of time. This kind of energy was of not much use to a human but it was not a bad nourishment for a Magical Beast. Hence, it had resulted in this Bone Mountain Range to become a spot where many Magical Beasts liked to gather.</p><br/><p>The Bone Mountain Range was located at the south-western part of the Beast Region. Due to them being afraid that the Soul Baby Fruit would be obtained by others first, Xiao Yan\u2019s group had hurried towards the Bone Mountain Range without stopping once they entered the Beast Region.</p><br/><p>The current Beast Region had undoubtedly become lively because of the appearance of the ancient remains. During Xiao Yan\u2019s group journey towards the Bone Mountain Range, they saw quite a number of experts, who obviously had the same destination as them. Amongst these experts were Magical Beasts that could take the human form as well as some human experts who had hurried over from outside the Beast Region after hearing the news. Clearly, word of the ancient remains appearing had already spread.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily frowned upon seeing this scene. It was unexpected that the allure of the ancient remains would actually be this great. These lone experts were still alright. The only thing Xiao Yan was worried about was some large factions coming as a group. Things would be a little troublesome if that was the case.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is rumoured that there is the existence of a Tian class Dou Technique in this ancient remains. It is likely that those large factions will be after that thing even if they come. Our target is only the Soul Baby Fruit. If things are not right when the time comes, we will take the Soul Baby Fruit and leave. It is not good to step onto this muddy water\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face had an expression of deep thought while he looked at the mountain range that swiftly moved backwards from under him. This did not mean that he was uninterested in the Tian class Dou Technique. Honestly speaking, even he had never seen just what a Tian class Dou Technique looked like until now. It was a lie if he said he was not curious. However, he understood the importance of various matters. Currently, the most important thing was to help Yao Lao recover his peak strength. Otherwise, the gap between the Falling Star Pavilion and the Hall of Soul would be a little too big. If the Hall of Soul manage to completely grasp them and attack, the Falling Star Pavilion would be finished.</p><br/><p>Of course, if the situation did not exceed his expectations after having obtained the Soul Baby Fruit, Xiao Yan could quietly think of doing something else. Tian class Dou Technique\u2026 this Dou Technique that existed in the legends would likely possess a strength that was comparable to Xiao Yan\u2019s Annihilation Fire Lotus.</p><br/><p>After traveling for two continuous days in the continuous mountain range of the enormous Beast Region, a glaring dense white colour suddenly appeared in the distance. This wisp of dense white colour appeared out of place within the lush green mountain range. However, an excitement surged into the eyes of Xiao Yan\u2019s group when they saw it. After nearly ten days of travelling, they had finally reached their destination.</p><br/><p>The number of people flying across the surrounding sky increased when they arrived at this place. Occasionally, there would be a figure flying across like a storm. Finally, it would rush towards the distant dense white mountain range.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are arriving at the Bone Mountain Range. There are two Elders from the Falling Star Pavilion investigating here. We should meet up with them first and discuss the subsequent matters. What do you say?\u201d Mu Qing Luan\u2019s expression had become much more solemn as she looked at the dense white mountain range in the distant. Even at such a great distance, she could still sense quite a number of unusually strong aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded slightly. Currently, this Bone Mountain Range was truly a chaotic place. Experts from various factions were gathered at this place. If they were to charge in without being aware of the situation, they might end up becoming the target of everyone.</p><br/><p>Mu Qing Luan took out an old jade from her Storage Ring after seeing Xiao Yan nodding. After which, she gently shattered it.</p><br/><p>Soon after the old jade was shattered, a figure swiftly rushed over from the distant mountain range. After which, it headed towards Xiao Yan\u2019s group. A moment later, it had appeared above the large eagle. The figure clearly sighed in relief when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>The one who had arrived was an old man in gray robes. He wore an Elder badge of the Falling Star Pavilion on his chest. However, this old man appeared a little miserable looking at this moment. It was as though he had just exchanged blows with someone.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Hu, what happened? Where is Elder Qi?\u201d Mu Qing Luan asked in a startled manner when she saw the appearance of this old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d The old man who was called Elder Hu laughed bitterly and immediately spoke with some anger, \u201cElder Qi and I have come to the Bone Mountain Range to investigate its situation on the orders of the two pavilion chiefs. Currently, quite a number of powerful factions and experts had come to this Bone Mountain Range. Everyone has found a spot to settle down within this mountain range and wait for the ancient remains to completely open. Elder Qi\u2019s and my luck are not bad. We found a mountain top that is near the ancient remains. That place could observe the activity of the remains in the quickest possible time. However, the two of us has just led some Falling Star Pavilion\u2019s disciples to built a camp there when we met the people from the Wind Lightning Pavilion\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWind Lightning Pavilion?\u201d Xiao Yan raised his brows slightly. It was indeed an old enemy.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey actually dared to attack?\u201d Mu Qing Luan\u2019s face sunk slightly. Some fury rose within her eyes. The current Wind Lightning Pavilion is becoming increasingly arrogant by relying on its good terms with the Heaven Phoenix tribe.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, there is no choice. This time around, even Lei zun-zhe from the Wind Lightning Pavilion has personally come. The two of us has yet to even reason it out with him when we were directly thrust aside. In his fury, Elder Qi also ended up being injured by the experts from the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Currently, some disciples are taking care of him and he is unable to move. Therefore, only I can come and receive you.\u201d Elder Hu sighed. Although he spoke in this manner, his face had some dissatisfaction. Clearly, the overbearing manner of the Wind Lightning Pavilion had caused him to be quite furious.</p><br/><p>Mu Qing Luan frowned tightly. Suddenly, she turned her head and looked at Xiao Yan. She softly said, \u201cTeacher has said that you will be in charge of everything in this trip\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Hu\u2019s eyes turned towards Xiao Yan upon hearing these words of Mu Qing Luan. He cupped his hands together respectfully and said, \u201cYou must be the personal disciple of the pavilion chief, junior chief Xiao Yan, right? Ke ke, the old me Hu Fu, greets junior chief.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Hu Fu is too courteous. Just call me Xiao Yan. I am unworthy of the title junior chief.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and waved his hand. He glanced at Mu Qing Luan, who was staring intently at him from behind. After thinking for a moment, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go and see Elder Qi first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I will lead the way.\u201d Elder Hu nodded, turned around and led the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Xiao Yan, what should we do about this? The Wind Lightning Pavilion has completely not given the Falling Star Pavilion any face. If we do not do anything, it is likely that we will end up being a joke to others.\u201d Mu Qing Luan softly said as she looked at Elder Hu, who was leading them in front.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled faintly but did not say anything. However, upon seeing this smile of his, Mu Qing Luan felt a little calm in her heart. Ever since she had become acquainted with Xiao Yan, she had never seen Xiao Yan suffer any loss. Even when he ended up suffering a serious injury and end up unconscious for a year, Xiao Yan had also got a five star Dou Zun to pay an arm as a price.</p><br/><p>Everyone followed Elder Hu to shuttle through the vast mountain range. Currently, this mountain range had already been occupied by a densely packed sea of people. It was noisy all day long, causing this originally quiet mountain range to become just like a marketplace. Various confusing noise surged over from all directions.</p><br/><p>This sea of people did not lack some powerful aura that caused even Xiao Yan to glance sideways. It seemed that the ancient remains this time around had indeed attract quite a number of true experts.</p><br/><p>The group had shuttled through the mountain range for quite awhile before finally coming to a stop at a remote small hill. At this moment, there were twenty over Falling Star Pavilion disciples guarding this hill. However, they currently appeared quite depressed and furious. Clearly, this was caused by the Wind Lightning Pavilion chasing them out from their camp without giving them any face.</p><br/><p>The return of Elder Wu caused everyone\u2019s attention to be braced. When they saw Mu Qing Luan\u2019s group, all of their morale was finally lifted a little. Quite a number of eyes paused on Xiao Yan. They had long since heard of this personal disciple of the pavilion chief, who had undertaken a retreat in the stone tower for a year.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough, junior chief, please forgive me for being unable to receive your arrival.\u201d</p><br/><p>A somewhat pale looking red clothed elder walked out from the tent with the support of two Falling Star Pavilion\u2019s disciples after Xiao Yan\u2019s group had landed. He cupped his hands together towards Xiao Yan\u2019s group and spoke respectfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cCough\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This Elder Qi could not resist coughing intensely after his voice had just sounded. Some traces of blood appeared on the corner of his mouth. Clearly, his internal organs were injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamnit, those bastards from the Wind Lightning Pavilion. Our main force of the Falling Star Pavilion did not come. Otherwise, they will not have any opportunity to be arrogant!\u201d The fury within the hearts of those surrounding Falling Star Pavilion\u2019s disciples rose when they saw this injury of Elder Qi.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly walked towards Elder Qi side. He grabbed the latter\u2019s hand and briefly examined his injuries. After which, he nodded slightly and said, \u201cYour injuries are quite serious. Who has attacked you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe northern pavilion chief of the Wind Lightning Pavilion, Fei Tian.\u201d Elder Qi sighed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. He immediately laughed softly. He had not met this northern pavilion chief Fei Tian for two to three years, yet the latter was still as overbearing as ever.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan took out a medicinal pill from his Storage Ring and handed it to Elder Qi. He stretched his lazy waist and said, \u201cHow many Dou Zuns does the Wind Lightning Pavilion have?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust Lei zun-zhe alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. After which, he slowly turned around in front of everyone\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior chief, you are?\u201d Elder Hu was startled upon seeing this. He hurriedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026 it\u2019s time to destroy their place.\u201d</p><br/><p>The faint voice that was being transmitted over caused the blood within the bodies of those Falling Star Pavilion\u2019s disciples present to boil instantly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

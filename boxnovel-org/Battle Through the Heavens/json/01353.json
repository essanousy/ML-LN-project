His eyes were grave as he looked at the crystal wall in front of him. At this moment, one could see some wiggling insect figures embedded in the crystal wall. Wave after wave of liquid energy continued to seep out of the wall. After which, it solidified and adhered to the crystal wall\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two, I shall leave the sides to the both of you\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan turned his head and spoke to Huo Zhi and Yao Xing Ji.</p><br/><p>Huo Zhi nodded when she heard his words. On the other hand, Yao Xing Ji merely glanced at Xiao Yan. Although he did not say anything, it was obvious that he was a little displeased in his heart that Xiao Yan was issuing orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Xing Ji withdrew his eyes. He moved his hands and a cluster of pale-black flames surfaced above his palm. A strange wind sound vaguely whistled when the flame materialized. One would feel an unusual irritation when this wind sound was transmitted into one\u2019s ears. It was as though this kind of unusual sound could stir one\u2019s emotions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>All the eyes present slide over when they saw the pale-black Heavenly Flame in Yao Xing Ji\u2019s hands. Their eyes were a little surprised. Something like a Heavenly Flame was far too rare. Even though they were members of the ancient clans, they could not simply see them just because they wanted to.</p><br/><p>\u201cNine Serene Wind Flame, ranked tenth on the Heavenly Flame Ranking\u2026\u201d The corner of Yao Xing Ji\u2019s mouth was involuntarily lifted when he saw everyone\u2019s surprised eyes. He smiled faintly and introduced the flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cNine Serene Wind Flame\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes also paused on this black flame. Being an alchemist, he had naturally heard of this thing. All Heavenly Flames formed in an extremely bizarre. An example was the Three Thousand Burning Flame, which was formed within the empty realm. This Nine Serene Wind Flame, on the other hand, was born from an endlessly deep abyss. Dark wind never ceased blowing all year round in that place. Even an ordinary elite Dou Zun would not dare to venture into it. This so-called Nine Serene Wind Flame was formed with the intense wind.</p><br/><p>One would not only require luck to obtain this Nine Serene Wind Flame. There was still a need to possess an extremely powerful strength. Based on Xiao Yan\u2019s guess, the price that the Yao clan had to pay to obtain this Heavenly Flame was not small.</p><br/><p>\u201cPuff!\u201d</p><br/><p>A slight noise suddenly appeared when everyone\u2019s eyes had gathered on the Nine Serene Wind Flame on Yao Xing Ji\u2019s hand. A deep-red color slowly glowed within the crystal tunnel. Many eyes looked in the direction of the light, only to see a cluster of deep-red bewitching flames slowly rising on a hand. The flame had formed numerous red lotus shapes.</p><br/><p>Following the appearance of this deep-red flame, the Nine Serene Wind Flame on Yao Xing Ji\u2019s hand became a little dimmer. Even the whistling wind had been greatly diminished. Yao Xing Ji\u2019s face involuntarily twitched when he saw his own Heavenly Flame acting like this. Although he felt a little displeased, he could do nothing about it. The Red Lotus Ye Flame was ranked two places higher than his Nine Serene Wind Flame. There was naturally a gap between the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, I think that this should be the Yan clan\u2019s Red Lotus Ye Flame, right?\u201d Gu Qing Yang looked at the Heavenly Flame in Huo Zhi\u2019s hand. He could not help but smile and ask a clarifying question.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Huo Ya tilted her head, but her pretty eyes shifted to Xiao Yan. Her eyes contained a strange feeling.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily smiled when he saw Huo Zhi\u2019s provoking eyes. This lady usually kept very quiet. However, it was unexpected that she would appear this wild when it came to something related to the Heavenly Flames.</p><br/><p>After exhaling gently, Xiao Yan gently clenched his hand. Threads of different colored flames seeped from his finger. They gathered together and turned into a cluster of purple-brown flames with a strand of a dense whiteness in it. The flame churned and numerous dragon fire seedlings continued to rise from within the flame. There was a vague dragon roar being emitted!</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d</p><br/><p>The red lotuses above the Red Lotus Ye Flame on Huo Zhi\u2019s hand began to fluctuate when the Heavenly Flame in Xiao Yan\u2019s hand appeared. It felt as though it had become illusory. On the other side, the Nine Serene Wind Flame on Yao Xing Ji\u2019s hand, which had already become somewhat dim after being suppressed by the Red Lotus Ye Flame, had become even dimmer. Even the whistling wind being emitted from it had completely disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough your Heavenly Flame\u2019s ranking is not ranked among the top, your Heavenly Flame is comparable to that of the top six Heavenly Flames after your merger\u2026 however, you are likely the first since ancient times to perform the crazy act of merging Heavenly Flames\u2026\u201d Huo Ya\u2019s pretty eyes revealed a fluctuation within them. A low and enchanting voice was emitted from under her veil.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was noncommittal toward these words. Merging Heavenly Flames might appear crazy, but it was not impossible. These words spoken as if he was the first to merge Heavenly Flames were likely untrue. At the very least, the owner who created the mysterious Qi Method called the Flame Mantra had merged Heavenly Flames\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we are pressed for time. Let\u2019s act now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan did not have time to discuss the matter of merging Heavenly Flames with Huo Zhi. After seeing that the other two had summoned their Heavenly Flames, Xiao Yan took a couple of steps forward and stopped in front of the crystal wall. He spoke in a deep voice, \u201cEveryone should follow close. Do not get left behind!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Heavenly Flame in Xiao Yan\u2019s hand suddenly soared when his voice appeared. It began to fiercely burn as a deafening dragon roared. A purple-brown dragon rushed out of the flame. It ruthlessly collided with the thick crystal wall. Sharp dragon claws danced as the crystal wall burst apart, forming a large hole.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The tail of the fire dragon was connected to Xiao Yan\u2019s hand. He sternly cried out and violently stomped his foot on the ground. His body swiftly charged forward. Gu Qing Yang and the rest followed close behind him!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat great flame control ability\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprise flashed across Huo Zhi\u2019s pretty eyes when she saw Xiao Yan transform the flame into a fire dragon which began to open the crystal walls. She swiftly followed, and the deep-red flame in her hand swept out at the same time and covered the crystal wall to the left. Its frighteningly high temperature quickly slowed the speed of the closing crystal wall.</p><br/><p>Yao Xing Ji on the other side had also begun to work. Although he was a little displeased that Xiao Yan was in command, the most important thing now was his life. He could be at odds with everyone, but he could not be at odds with his own life. Hence, he had also put in all his effort when he acted.</p><br/><p>The fire dragon whistled and rushed forward within the crystal wall. The frightening temperature had completely incinerated the Ancient Devouring Insects hidden in the wall from some distance away. Despite this being the case, the Ancient Devouring Insects continued to surge over like moths attracted to a flame. The enormous energy that seeped out also pose quite a great obstruction to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Explosions continued to be heard within the crystal wall. The advancement speed of Xiao Yan\u2019s group had become much faster.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kind of exhaustion is really too frightening\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>While his body was swiftly advancing, Xiao Yan also sensed the Dou Qi within his body seeping out like floodwater. His eyes had become much more solemn as he clenched his hand. A bag appeared in it. However. he did not take anything out. Instead, he grabbed the brag, circulated his Qi Method and swiftly absorbed the energy within the energy cores. After which, he poured it into the body of the fire dragon in front, which was doing its best to open the crystal wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much further is it?\u201d The expressions of Gu Qing Yang and the rest behind had become grave when they saw Xiao Yan devouring energy cores like a whale devouring plankton. The crystal wall was extremely hard, and the Ancient Devouring Insects were blocking him. Even though Xiao Yan possessed a Heavenly Flame, it was still not as easy as he had imagined.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt will take another half an hour or so before we will break through the light curtain.\u201d That silver-robed man mused.</p><br/><p>Gu Qing Yang slightly noddes. All he could do was hope that Xiao Yan could endure\u2026</p><br/><p>Ferocious explosions occurred along the way. The rumbling sound did not cease, and the atmosphere of the tunnel was quite tense. Their hearts would involuntarily pound each time they saw Xiao Yan absorb the energy cores one bag at a time. This kind of exhaustion was really too frightening.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The fire dragon whistled and heavily collided with the crystal wall. Crystals shot in all directions as Xiao Yan\u2019s feet slowed. He spoke in a deep voice, \u201cThere is no more energy cores\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The faces of quite a number of people twitched when they heard his words. Gu Qing Yang mused for a moment and swiftly took out a bright energy core. He handed it to Xiao Yan, \u201cThis is a nine star energy core. I only have one\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not enough!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan received it without any hesitation, but he still shook his head. Ten percent of the Dou Qi within his body was exhausted every meter they advanced. A nine star energy core might be powerful, but it was still not enough to support them through the light curtain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also have one here\u2026\u201d Huo Xuan hesitated for a moment before taking out another nine star energy core.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me another three of them!\u201d Xiao Yan exhaled and called on everyone.</p><br/><p>Everyone became quiet when they heard his words. After all, a nine star energy core was a precious thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, if we end up dying here, possessing many energy cores will be pointless.\u201d That man from the Lei clan sighed. He flicked his finger and an energy core shot into Xiao Yan\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I will trouble brother Xiao Yan\u2026\u201d The two large men from the Shi clan faced each other before swiftly handing an energy core to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes involuntarily landed upon the Hun Ya duo at the back after the Shi clan handed over their energy core. Hun Ya\u2019s eyelids twitched when he saw their gazes. At this moment, he also understood that his words were useless. All he could do was clench his teeth, take out an energy core, and toss it to Xiao Yan. In order to obtain this nine star energy core, Hun Li and him had put in a lot of effort for a prolonged period of time. It was unexpected that they would now have to hand it to a person that they did not see eye-to-eye with.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan held the five nine star energy cores in his hand and slowly sighed. A punch was thrown out. The fire glow on the fire dragon in front of him suddenly soared. It transformed into a fire figure that instantly penetrated through layer after layer of wall like a thunderbolt. Xiao Yan\u2019s group swiftly followed it from behind.</p><br/><p>This kind of all out forward charge continued for nearly half an hour. The fire glow in the fire dragon finally began to gradually dim.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are about to exit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gave a low cry as he observed the dimming fire dragon. He lifted his head and looked at the emerald-like crystal wall in front of him. Densely packed Ancient Devouring Insects had covered their trail. Only by charging forward would they be able to truly enter the third level of the Heavenly Tomb.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh? This is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes drifted just as the fire dragon was about to violently collide with the emerald wall. They focused on something in the middle of that crystal wall. There was a fist-sized creature emitting a pale-red light at that spot. Looking from a distance, it appeared just like an insect cocoon!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

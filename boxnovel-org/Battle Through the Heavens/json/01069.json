Dou Qi slowly surged from their bodies. A cold smile was present on their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are really Xin Lan\u2019s friend, please remain in the Ye clan for awhile. We might still be able to have a proper discussion\u2026\u201d The green-clothed, old man\u2019s eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan while he spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was expressionless. The current him was only concerned about the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s situation. Where would he find the time to bother about whatever Ye clan\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze turned to Xin Lan as he spoke. After which, he turned around and walked toward the exit of the hall. The two Ye clan\u2019s Elders, who were blocking the door, were completely ignored by him.</p><br/><p>This action of Xiao Yan caused Xin Lan to be a little startled. She looked at his back and knew that if she did not follow him herself, it was likely that Xiao Yan would no longer bother about the promise he had given her\u2026 a struggle flashed across Xin Lan\u2019s face when she thought of this. She suddenly clenched her silver teeth, turned around and followed close behind Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cInsolence!\u201d</p><br/><p>A fury immediately surged into the faces of the two Ye clan Elders blocking the exit when they saw Xiao Yan\u2019s arrogance. They let out a cold cry and the both of them attacked in unison. Their hands contained a surging force as they grabbed at Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders in a lightning-like manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression did not change in the face of an attack by two three star Dou Zongs. He flicked his finger and a silver glow flashed. A silver-colored figure immediately appeared\u2026</p><br/><p>Clang!</p><br/><p>The two Elder\u2019s sharp-eagle-claw-like hands rushed over in a lightning-like fashion. After which, they heavily collided with the silver-colored figure. A metallic sound as well as sparks were emitted when both parties made contact.</p><br/><p>This contact caused the expressions of the two Elders to drastically change. Before they could pull back, however, a pair of silver-colored metallic arms penetrated the silver glow while revealing afterimages. They ruthlessly landed on the respective chests of these two with such a fast speed that they could not react.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug!\u201d</p><br/><p>The silver-colored metallic fists did not carry any majestic Dou Qi. However, it unleashed shocking damage when the fists landed on the bodies of the two Elders. The both of them flew back like kites with broken strings. Finally, they were forced out of the hall. Two mouthfuls of fresh blood were spat out soon after.</p><br/><p>The interior of the hall was once again in complete silence as everyone looked at the two Elders, who were suddenly sent flying from the large hall. Quite a number of people quietly swallowed a mouthful of saliva. Numerous shocked eyes paused on the silver glow beside Xiao Yan. Following the gradual disappearance of this silver glow, a silver-colored figure was slowly revealed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the last time. Next time, I will not show any mercy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s back faced the people from the Ye clan. His voice contained some ice-cold killing intent. The repeated hindrances had gradually exhausted his patience.</p><br/><p>The gloomy expression of the green-clothed, old man at the leader\u2019s seat slowly became solemn. His eyes stared intently at the completely still silver-colored human figure beside Xiao Yan. He sensed a dangerous feeling from its body.</p><br/><p>Currently, the Earth Demon Puppet had undoubtedly been greatly strengthened after absorbing the Pill Lightning at the Burning Flame Valley. According to Xiao Yan\u2019s guess, it should be able to fight head-on against a seven star Dou Zong. This First Elder of the Ye clan was merely a six star Dou Zong. It was impossible for him to be a match for the Earth Demon Puppet.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is\u2026a puppet?\u201d</p><br/><p>The green-clothed, old man\u2019s eyes paused on the Earth Demon Puppet for a moment. Finally, he appeared to have discovered something. His eyes narrowed while he slowly spoke, looking at Xiao Yan with surprise as he did so.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan did not reply. He waved his sleeves and once again stored the Earth Demon Puppet into his Storage Ring. He demanded, \u201cCan I bring Xin Lan with me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The green-clothed, old man tightly frowned. His gaze was focused on Xiao Yan. This mysterious, young man had not only reached the Dou Zong class at such a young age, but he was also in possession of a puppet with a mind-boggling strength. It seemed that his background was quite impressive. No wonder Xin Lan would always be confident when speaking about him\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe old me is Ye Zhong, the first Elder of the Ye clan. Is this young friend named Xiao Yan?\u201d The gloominess in the green-clothed, old man\u2019s face was slowly withdrawn as he cupped his hands to Xiao Yan. The strength that Xiao Yan had displayed was sufficient to shake the current Ye clan. Hence, his tone was clearly much more polite than it was earlier.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded but did not wish to remain for long. He raised his leg and walked out of the hall. Xin Lan behind him hesitated for a moment before turning her head to Ye Zhong. She said, \u201cFirst Elder, I will return once big brother Xiao Yan settles his issues.\u201d Xin Lan hurriedly followed Xiao Yan after replying to him</p><br/><p>Ye Zhong widened his mouth when he saw this situation. However, he could only let out a sigh. He ceased saying anything and allowed the two of them to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder\u2026\u201d The fourth Elder, who had been defeated by Xiao Yan with one palm, climbed to his feet at this moment and looked at Ye Zhong.</p><br/><p>Ye Zhong waved his hand and sighed, \u201cForget it, let them leave. This Xiao Yan might indeed not be an ordinary person. The Ye clan might really have to rely on him this time around.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can it be? He might be very strong, but this little strength is far from sufficient from allowing our Ye clan to enter the Pill Tower Elders seat\u2026 isn\u2019t putting our hope on a person whose background we are unfamiliar with a little\u2026\u201d That fourth Elder hesitated for a moment before speaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe have no choice. Currently, quite a number of strong factions are setting their sights on our Ye clan. If we do not adopt any measures, it is likely that the Ye clan will really be finished\u2026\u201d Ye Zhong shook his head and helplessly uttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow\u2026 let\u2019s hope that this young man called Xiao Yan is really as capable as Xin Lan described. Moreover, it is likely that the matter today has given him a bad impression of our Ye clan. Ugh, this is also a matter that gives me a headache\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan grabbed Xin Lan\u2019s arm after having led her out of the Ye clan. He flew out of the city. A moment later, he finally stopped on a mountain top outside of the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should be aware of the matter regarding the Little Fairy Doctor, right?\u201d Xiao Yan immediately asked in a deep voice after having landed on the mountain top.</p><br/><p>Xin Lan slightly nodded. The back of her teeth bit her lower red lip as she softly said, \u201cBack then, Little Fairy Doctor jie-jie, Zi Yan, and I successfully exited the Wormhole. After which, we spent a couple of months to reach the Pill Region. Once we arrived in the Pill Region, an immoral faction called the \u2018Yuxian Gate\u2019 set their eyes on Little Fairy Doctor jie-jie due to her beauty. In her anger, she killed everyone in that faction. However, Yuxian Gate\u2019s chief is also an elite Dou Zong. Although he ended up dying to Little Fairy Doctor jie-jie\u2019s hands, she had also suffered some injuries. Coincidentally, it had resulted in the weakening of the seal and the Woeful Poison Body erupted. Finally\u2026 she was discovered by someone\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Woeful Poison Body is a representation of disaster in the Pill Region because there have been a number of disasters that have been created as a result of the Woeful Poison Body erupting\u2026 therefore, the news of the Woeful Poison Body had just spread when many factions attacked her. The Ice River Valley is the most active one. However, their intention is not to destroy the Woeful Poison Body. Instead, they wished to obtain this special body because the Ice River Valley loves to collect different kinds of unique bodies. After which, they will use a special method to transfer the soul of an expert within the valley into the body. Thus, they will be able to obtain some of the ability in her body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression gradually became dark and solemn when he heard Xin Lan\u2019s words. This Ice River Valley was indeed not something good.</p><br/><p>\u201cSome time earlier, the place the Little Fairy Doctor had been hiding was discovered by the Ice River Valley. After which, she exchanged blows with the other party\u2019s experts and suffered a serious injury\u2026 big brother Xiao Yan\u2026 Xin Lan is useless. I cannot even be of any help.\u201d Xin Lan\u2019s eyes also turned red when she spoke until this point. She had blamed herself over her helplessness.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air. He waved his hand and said. \u201cThis is not your fault\u2026 you should know where the Little Fairy Doctor is currently at, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I have received the information that Little Fairy Doctor jie-jie has sent to me. However, that place is currently surrounded by the experts from the Ice River Valley. I am unable to even enter.\u201d Xin Lan nodded and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFallen God Stream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed that place\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes and spoke in a low voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough Little Fairy Doctor jie-jie has fled the encirclement of the Ice River Valley, she has suffered a serious injury and doesn\u2019t dare reveal herself. However, the Fallen God Stream has already been surrounded by the Ice River Valley. The terrain there might be complicated but it is only a matter of time before she is found\u2026\u201d Xin Lan softly said, \u201cBig brother Xiao Yan, what do you plan to do now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat else can I do\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan stood up. His eyes looked to the north as a dense, cold glint flashed across them. \u201cHead to the Fallen God Stream!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I shall lead the way for you! I know how to find Little Fairy Doctor jie-jie once I enter the Fallen God Stream.\u201d Xin Lan clenched her teeth and informed him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly nodded. Immediately, he seemed to have recalled something and asked, \u201cThat\u2019s right, where is Zi Yan? Has she been following beside Little Fairy Doctor?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZi Yan\u2026\u201d Xin Lan was startled when she heard this. She immediately let out a bitter laugh, \u201cShe has been missing not long after we arrived in the Pill Region\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMissing?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s expression immediately changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe cannot be described as missing either. She left a message for us saying that she suddenly sensed something and wanted to return home\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReturn home?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan tightly knit his brows. Zi Yan\u2019s identity had always been a mystery. However, Xiao Yan could vaguely guess that her identity was definitely extremely strong. He wondered just where her so called home was\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, hopefully that girl is fine. Now, we can only wait until the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s problems are settled before finding her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed. He once again grabbed Xin Lan and moved his body, rushing to the northern sky as he did so. He needed to find the Little Fairy Doctor as soon as possible!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

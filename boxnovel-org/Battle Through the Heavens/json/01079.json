This Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast possessed an extremely frightening strength. A fierce battle was likely unavoidable today if they wanted to hunt it.</p><br/><p>A blood-red figure remained suspended in the sky. Enormous dragon wings slowly flapped behind it, carrying wave after wave of wild wind. However, other than the wings and the sharp scorpion tail behind, this Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast was no different from an ordinary human. Moreover, his face was extremely handsome. Additionally, there was an evil-feeling vaguely seeping from him.</p><br/><p>The Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast slowly descended from the sky. Finally, it paused in the air above. His eyes swept over the Little Fairy Doctor before pausing on Xiao Yan beside her. He lifted his eyebrows and laughed, \u201cI was wondering why you have the guts to deliver yourself to this place. You have actually got some helpers. However, just this brat\u2019s two star Dou Zong\u2019s strength makes him unworthy of attacking this king!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have come to this place with the intention of obtaining something from you.\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor slightly smiled as she softly informed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? This is naturally not a problem. As long as you remain behind to be this king\u2019s woman, never mind asking for just one thing. Even if you demand more, this king will be able to give it to you.\u201d The Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast laughed when he heard this. His gaze immediately contained some lewdness as he stared at the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s alluring body. He had never met a woman who could attract him in this manner in all these years. However, he clearly understood that this kind of attraction was mostly due to the Woeful Poison Body.</p><br/><p>Being a poison beast, this kind of Woeful Poison Body was just like tonic to him. Just the scent of her would cause his soul to flutter and feel incomparably comfortable. When he met the Little Fairy Doctor for the first time back then, he knew that this woman would definitely be his!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, please hand your Monster Core to me.\u201d The gaze of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast caused a cold glint to flash across the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s eyes while she demanded in a faint voice.</p><br/><p>The smile on the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast\u2019s handsome face slowly stiffened while a gloominess appeared. He licked his lips and said, \u201cIt seems that those who come don\u2019t have any good intentions and those with good intentions don\u2019t come. If it had been someone else who said these words in front of this king, he would definitely be turned into a corpse at this moment. However, this king is so fascinated by you. Therefore, this offense to me shall be repaid by the man beside you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dragon wings behind the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast were flapped after these words sounded. His body suddenly disappeared from the spot!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes narrowed the moment the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast\u2019s body disappeared. At the same time, a silver glow flashed under his feet as he swiftly withdrew by a couple of steps.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s withdrawing feet had just landed when a hand with blood-red, sharp nails tore through the spot in front of him, like a sharp sword. A dark-black line appeared in the space where the hand passed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The empty space in front emitted a surprised \u2018huh\u2019 when the attack missed. Immediately, the body of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast surfaced in an unusual manner. His gaze was dark as he glanced at Xiao Yan. Without saying a word, he emitted a \u2018swoosh\u2019 sound as a black figure rushed out in a lightning-like fashion, piercing through the sky. Within a flash, it appeared in front of Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead. An unusually sharp scorpion tail had appeared. The sharp tip contained a bright-red color. Clearly, it possessed a lethal poison.</p><br/><p>Chi!</p><br/><p>The sharp scorpion tail\u2019s tip pierced at Xiao Yan\u2019s forehead in a lightning-like manner. After which, it penetrated through his forehead, but no fresh blood appeared\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cAfterimage?\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprise immediately flashed across the eyes of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast when he saw this scene. He swept his gaze around, only to see a figure slowly appearing a few dozen meters away. That figure was Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cGood brat, I have underestimated you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast also felt surprised when he saw Xiao Yan dodge the attack from his scorpion tail. However, before he could act, a grayish-purple Dou Qi pillar shot over from behind him, accompanied by the ear-piercing sound of rushing wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, little beauty, this little attack can\u2019t do anything to this king.\u201d The Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast laughed when he sensed the wind from behind him. The scorpion tail behind him pierced out in a flash. After which, it easily blocked the grayish-purple Dou Qi pillar.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t care where you have come from. Since you have come, there is no need to leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast laughed out loud as his eyes swept over Xiao Yan and the Little Fairy Doctor. After which, he opened his hand and let out a clear loud roar to the sky.</p><br/><p>This place suddenly began quiver after the roar spread. Immediately, rampaging noises could be heard. Xiao Yan and the Little Fairy Doctor looked in the direction the noises had come from, and they saw a black line sweeping over the land like an ocean wave from the horizon. Poison gas that filled the air lingered over that black line and formed something like a poison cloud\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful, all of them are poison beasts within the Fallen God Stream\u2026\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s body flashed and appeared beside Xiao Yan. Her face was solemn when she spoke.</p><br/><p>The black line gradually approached while Little Fairy Doctor was speaking. Xiao Yan glanced over and found that it was not a black line. Instead, it was a sea of densely packed poison beasts. The poison cloud that agglomerated in the air was formed from the breaths of these poison beasts\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes coagulated as he studied this scene. He was even able to sense two similarly strong auras from within the densely packed sea of poison beasts. Although they were much weaker compared to this Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast, they should have reached the strength of a four star Dou Zong or so\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis king is the overlord of this region. Since you have arrived at this place, whether you live or die will also be determined by this king!\u201d A dark, dense expression surfaced on the evil face of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast as he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will deal with these poison beasts. Leave the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast for the Earth Demon Puppet and old mister Yao to handle. It is likely that they will properly entertain him\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan merely smiled faintly in the face of the arrogance of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast. He flicked his finger and the Earth Demon Puppet appeared in front of him. Immediately, he rubbed his finger over the white-colored ring and Tian Huo zun-zhe\u2019s illusionary soul slowly drifted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, little fellow, you really think too highly of the old me. You have found such a troublesome fellow\u2026\u201d Tian Huo zun-zhe saw the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast with the monstrous poison fog not far away after he appeared. He immediately exclaimed, \u201cThis fellow\u2019s fighting strength is likely even stronger than that Fei Tian. How did you offend such an existence?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no choice. The Essence Blood of a rank 7 Magical Beast is needed to help you refine a body\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan spread his hands and smiled as he answered.</p><br/><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe was momentarily dull when he heard this. He immediately and helplessly shook his head as he said, \u201cAlright alright. Little fellow, you always have a reason. However, I alone will not be able to deal with him.\u201d Although Tian Huo zun-zhe\u2019s Spiritual Strength was quite powerful, it would be a little lacking if he were to openly fight with an expert at the level of this Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast. All of these drawbacks were due to his inability to use Dou Qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Earth Demon Puppet will do its best to aid you\u2026 I think that there should not be any problem, right?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s finger pointed to the Earth Demon Puppet beside him and laughed.</p><br/><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe sighed in relief when he saw the puppet. The fighting strength of the current Earth Demon Puppet was not inferior to that of an eight star Dou Zong. With its help, Tian Huo zun-zhe would have greater confidence when facing that fellow.</p><br/><p>The smile on the face of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast stiffened a little when Tian Huo zun-zhe and the Earth Demon Puppet appeared. His voice was gloomy as he said, \u201cSo, you have come prepared\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan faintly smiled. He ignored that fellow and glanced at the countless numbers of poison beasts rushing over while emitting a loud rumbling sound. After which, his eyes slid to Tian Huo zun-zhe and said, \u201cOld mister Yao, try to be as quick as possible. The Little Fairy Doctor and I will stop all these poison beasts.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye, no problem. With the Earth Demon Puppet, it will not be too difficult to finish him off\u2026\u201d Tian Huo zun-zhe slowly nodded as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld fellow aren\u2019t you afraid of biting your tongue by saying such big words. This king is a member of the Scorpion Dragon Tribe. You dare to touch me?\u201d The eyes of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast were dark and dense as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cScorpion Dragon Tribe?\u201d Xiao Yan frowned slightly. He had heard of this Magical Beast tribe before. It could be considered an extremely powerful tribe in the Magical Beast world. Moreover, their reputation was also quite great. It is rumored that all the members of this Scorpion Dragon Tribe possess a rare Ancient Dragon bloodline within their bodies.</p><br/><p>Ancient Dragon. It was referring to that extremely mysterious Void Ancient Dragon. There was seldom anyone on the Dou Qi continent who had seen traces of such a legendary existence. Within the Magical Beast world, any Magical Beast who possessed the hint of a relation to this mysterious Void Ancient Dragon was an indication that they were strong. They were just like this Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast in front. The strength of an eight star Dou Zong could be considered a top tier expert across the entire Dou Qi continent.</p><br/><p>Moreover, this Scorpion Dragon Tribe was much greater in numbers compared to the Void Ancient Dragon. Hence, even though it could not be compared to a tribe like the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe, they could be considered ranked among the top.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan did not expect this Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast to be a member of that Scorpion Dragon tribe. However, now that things had developed like this, he had no choice but to continue. Forget about this fellow being a member of the Scorpion Dragon tribe. Even if he was a Void Ancient Dragon, it was likely that Xiao Yan would still have no choice but to attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld mister Yao, please attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes turned to Tian Huo zun-zhe. A dense coldness flashed across his face as he slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>A cold glint flashed across the empty hollow eyes of the Earth Demon Puppets by the side after Xiao Yan\u2019s last words sounded. The silver glow on its bright body became even more intense. It did not even pause for a moment as its body flashed and rushed at the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast!</p><br/><p>The expression of the Sky Poison Dragon Scorpion Beast immediately became quite ugly when he saw the Earth Demon Puppet rushing over. Killing intent surged wildly in his eyes. He furiously laughed, \u201cSince all of you are seeking death, this king shall grant your wishes, ants!\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe illusionary body trembled before slowly disappearing in a strange fashion. A clear, loud laugh carried a pride that resounded over the sky!</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, ants? If the old me had not lost my body, you would also be just an ant in the eyes of the old me. Even though this is the case, the old me will definitely take your Essence Blood today!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

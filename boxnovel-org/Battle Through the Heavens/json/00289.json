With his previous experience, he could clearly sense the flame was doped with some unknown things which were in turn absorbed into his body the instant the green colored flame was withdrawn.</p><br/><p>\u201cA mutation of the \u2018Searing Poison\u2019 is indeed scary. Even with my current flame controlling ability, I am unable to completely incinerate it. Ugh, it is likely that only Yao Lao\u2019s \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 can completely remove it.\u201d Xiao Yan slowly removed his finger, shook his head and sighed softly in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe will stop here for this poison removing session. After a couple more times, I think that the poison in your body will be completely removed.\u201d Xiao Yan retracted his finger into his sleeves, then eyed Nalan Jie, whose expression was much improved since the last time, and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you very much Little Brother Yan Xiao. I am able to sense that the \u2018Searing Poison\u2019 in my body is gradually decreasing.\u201d Nalan Jie wiped off the perspiration on his forehead. The intense pain each time the poison was expelled was very exhausting, similar to him having gone through a battle with a strong person of the same class. He turned his head around and thanked Xiao Yan, whose face showed slight exhaustion.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is just that each of us are holding what the other requires.\u201d Xiao Yan indifferently shook his head. His mind scanned the interior of his body a couple of times. He knit his eyebrows even deeper as he realized that the \u2018Searing Poison\u2019 appeared to have become even more dense in his body after this poison removing session.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh\u2026 this thing. I wonder if it is a blessing or trouble. It would be good if Teacher was here. With the experience of his elderly self, I would not need to blindly worry about such matters\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan softly sighed and could only speak with a bitter smile in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Little Brother Yan Xiao. It must have been hard on you for these past two days. If you need any medicinal ingredients or other things, you can tell us. These are all small matters. Just let our Nalan clan go and settle it. You just need to rest.\u201d Seeing Nalan Jie\u2019s increasingly ruddy complexion, the smile on Nalan Su\u2019s face also increased. He took two steps forward and said with the smile still on his face to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment. He conveniently took out a paper and pen from the storage ring. After which, he swiftly wrote some rare and precious medicinal ingredients that were rarely seen in the market. After which, he handed it over to Nalan Su. Since the other party was a big fat sheep, it would be a waste not to slaughter. In any case, with the financial strength of the Nalan clan, this little bit was an insufficient amount that wouldn\u2019t even make their hearts ache.</p><br/><p>TL: Fat sheep = lot of resources, Slaughter = take a generous cut</p><br/><p>Nalan Su received the paper and took a glance at it. His expression did not have the slightest change because of the valuable medicinal ingredients on it. He called out and got a female servant to follow what was written on it and take them out from the clan\u2019s warehouse. During the whole process, Nalan Su\u2019s response did not have the slightest hesitation, acting in an ostentatious manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Little Brother Yan Xiao, why don\u2019t we go to the living room to take a seat first. The things that you need will immediately be brought over.\u201d Seeing that the female servant had exited from the room, Nalan Jie, who had finished wearing his clothes, smiled and said to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded slightly and lifted his leg to follow Nalan Jie and Nalan Su in front of him.</p><br/><p>After exiting the door, they passed through a quiet corridor before the three of them walked into the luxurious living room. They had just taken their seats when the female servant at the side hurriedly served them fragrant tea. After which, she bowed her body and stepped back.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Brother Yan Xiao, I assume that the purpose of you coming to the capital this time around would be to participate in the Alchemist Grand Meeting, right?\u201d Nalan Jie lifted his teacup, took a slow sip and asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, all the mighty people have gathered for this Grand Meeting. It seems that there will be a good show to watch.\u201d Nalan Su seated by his side smiled and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am only here to join the fun and don\u2019t have much ability to compete with the others.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are really modest. Possessing something as unique as a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, it would be impossible for you not to display your splendor.\u201d Nalan Jie shook his head and immediately laughed, \u201cBefore the Grand Meeting, there is definitely a need for some practice. If Little Brother Yan Xiao needs any medicinal ingredients, you can just mention them to me. As long as our Nalan clan has it, we will definitely not be stingy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you want to win me over early\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan sipped his tea, slightly shook his head and whispered in his heart.</p><br/><p>The kind of prospects that an alchemist who possessed a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was something that a strong person like Nalan Jie was extremely clear of. Therefore, Xiao Yan might only be a tier two alchemist now but Nalan Jie still had put in all his effort to win the former over. As the saying goes, \u2018one\u2019s mouth will be shorter after eating other people\u2019s things\u2019. If Xiao Yan really did as he had said and randomly took the medicinal ingredients from the Nalan clan, it would not be easy for Xiao Yan to reject Nalan Jie when he invited Xiao Yan to be an alchemist for the Nalan clan in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will come and find the two of you when I require them.\u201d Xiao Yan did not immediately reject him. However, his vague words did not agree either.</p><br/><p>As a person who had become wise with age, Nalan Jie naturally could hear Xiao Yan\u2019s vague meaning. He smiled and his face did not have any disappointed emotion. With a smile, he diverted their topic of conversation and began to randomly inquire about some other information about Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha. May I ask who is Little Brother Yan Xiao\u2019s teacher? I am able to recognize over half of the Jia Ma Empire\u2019s well known alchemists. However, I have never heard of any one of their students possessing a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 at such a young age.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher doesn\u2019t like to reveal himself. He has been living in isolation. Before I left, his elderly self had instructed me not to reveal any information about him.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s like this, I will not make things difficult for you.\u201d Hearing the words, Nalan Jie smiled and nodded. His heart, however, muttered, \u201cA strong person hidden from the world? With Yan Xiao\u2019s age, it is naturally impossible for him to rein in the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 by himself, I think that his Teacher should have given quite a lot of help on this. A strong person who could rein in a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 should at least be a Dou Huang. Looks like the strength behind this little fellow cannot be underestimated. If I can win him over, there would be many benefits\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Xiao Yan\u2019s casual reply, time slowly passed by. The female servant that had gone to obtain the medicinal ingredients carried a silver plate and walked into the living room with a curled posture. She then respectfully placed the plate on the table beside Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Glancing at those perfectly preserved medicinal ingredients on the silver plate, Xiao Yan nodded his head slightly. It looked like the Nalan clan had quite a number of skilled people who knew how to take care of their medicinal ingredients.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan cautiously stored the medicinal ingredients into his storage ring. Not intending to wait, Xiao Yan didn\u2019t continue to stay any longer. Immediately, he stood up and bid the other two goodbye.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, let us see Little Brother Yan Xiao off.\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan stand up, Nalan Jie also hurriedly did the same. After which, he and Nalan Su walked shoulder to shoulder out of the living room.</p><br/><p>Once they were out of the room, they walked along a small path. The Nalan clan members who were coming and going hurriedly greeted them. They waited until the three of them walked away before facing each other in shock. Immediately afterwards, they threw their curious and surprised gazes at Xiao Yan. In the whole of the Jia Ma Empire, there were no more than five people who had the qualification for both, the old grandfather of the Nalan clan and the clan head to respectfully send someone off together. Yet this young person who appeared only around twenty years old actually possessed the qualification to enjoy such a respectful treatment?</p><br/><p>Under the surprised and strange gazes throughout the journey, the three of them finally came to the main door. Xiao Yan bowed slightly toward Nalan Jie and Nalan Su. He was just about to leave when the corner of his eye suddenly stiffened at the sight of two human figures who were slowly walking over to the Nalan clan.</p><br/><p>Of the two human figures, one was a male and the other was a female. The lady was wearing a moon white colored robe with trailing spacious sleeves. Her elegant footsteps caused people to have an extremely pleasing beautiful feeling. Her pretty face, which carried a little smile, hooked the gazes of the surrounding men as she passed by.</p><br/><p>The man was wearing an alchemist long robe. His age was also quite young and his figure was tall and straight, appearing only slightly over twenty years old. His handsome face had lines that seemed to be carved by a knife, emitting a somewhat feminine feeling. The gentle smile on his face also had an easy time moving some ladies\u2019 hearts. When comparing the appearance of this person to Xiao Yan\u2019s disguised appearance, it was like two polar regions that were extremely far apart.</p><br/><p>Of course, the thing that attracted the most attention was still the alchemist badge on the young man\u2019s chest. On it, three silver colored ripples reflected an eye-piercing glow under the sunlight. Those passersby, whose heart originally had contained a sour feeling because of the other party having the company of such a beautiful woman, felt dull initially upon seeing the three silver colored ripples that represented his status. Immediately, the unhappiness in their eyes automatically turned into one of respect that one used when faced with a strong person.</p><br/><p>The man and the lady slowly walked over. A talented man and a beautiful woman, a perfect couple. They attracted the attention of quite a number of eyes on the street. Immediately, numerous amazed and envious gazes were thrown over as two of them suddenly became the focus of attention on the street.</p><br/><p>At the moment when Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze paused on the two of them, Nalan Jie and Nalan Su beside him also noticed the two people walking over. When their gazes swept onto the man by Nalan Yanran\u2019s side, each of their expressions were somewhat different.</p><br/><p>Staring at the two of them who were slowly walking over, Xiao Yan lowered his head slightly. For some unknown reason, his heart faintly had a hint of anger. A long while later, he inhaled a breath of icy cool air. He understood that although he no longer had those feelings for the lady in front of him, she was still someone who had nearly become his wife regardless of all that had happened. Now that he saw her conversing and laughing with another man as they walked together, he would naturally feel a knot in his heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan raised his head. The emotions in his eyes were completely withdrawn by him as he calmly watched the two people who had arrived in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Yan Xiao, we have troubled you again today.\u201d As the two people reached the main door, Nalan Yanran greeted Nalan Jie and Nalan Su before she smiled and spoke to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan did not open his mouth to speak. He merely shook his head. His face, which was covered by the icy silk mask, appeared slightly cold.</p><br/><p>Having known Xiao Yan for a day, Nalan Yanran also knew about his indifferent character and was unconcerned with it. She pointed to the man by her side and said with a smile, \u201cMister Yan Xiao, this is my friend, Liu Ling. He is also an alchemist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you, Mister Yan Xiao.\u201d That handsome man extended his hand as he smiled and greeted Xiao Yan. His smile was extremely gentle, appearing quite sincere.</p><br/><p>\u201cNice to meet you.\u201d Xiao Yan extended his hand and held the other party\u2019s hand as he spoke calmly. His eyes watched Liu Ling. Ever since he had left Wu Tan City, the young man in front of him was the first young person who caused Xiao Yan to actually pay close attention to. Being able to become a tier three alchemist at such a young age, his talent was definitely not weaker than Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Liu Ling boy, why have you run over here instead of learning refining skills from your teacher?\u201d Nalan Jie glanced at this man who was extremely outstanding. He sighed slightly in his heart. Liu Ling was the most outstanding young man that he had seen during these last few years. If one were to discuss about talent and ability, he was a man who was a good match to Nalan Yanran. He also knew that his extremely haughty granddaughter may also have a favorable impression of this very outstanding young man who was at her age. Although this small favorable impression was far from having any feelings, Liu Ling was one of the few males of her age who had given her a favorable impression in many years.</p><br/><p>While Liu Ling was indeed very outstanding, the agreement with his old friend back then had always been in Nalan Jie\u2019s heart. Just thinking about the little fellow from the Xiao clan whose engagement was broken off, his heart was filled with regret and helplessness. Therefore, he had some resistance to Liu Ling and Nalan Yanran becoming too close. He was still trying to think up ways to rescue the already shattered pre-arranged marriage.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Grand Meeting is about to begin soon. The Grand Meeting has gathered countless strong people in the empire\u2019s alchemist scene. There is always someone better than one. Therefore, Teacher has asked me to descend from the mountains and experience it for myself. Additionally, Teacher also asked me to send his regards to Old Sir.\u201d Liu Ling bowed slightly and replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Yan Xiao, I didn\u2019t expect that you were able to help Old Sir remove the \u2018Searing Poison\u2019 at such a young age. It really surprises people. Back then, Teacher had also come and taken a look, but did not have the slightest solution. Ha ha, I think that Mister Yan Xiao should be in possession of the legendary \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, right?\u201d Liu Ling turned his gaze to Xiao Yan by the side and laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes narrowed as he probed Liu Ling and asked, \u201cWho is your teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy teacher is Gu He.\u201d Liu Ling gently smiled and said. Although he hid the pride in his smile very deeply, some of it still seeped out.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it is Pill-King Gu He\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan muttered softly in his heart. He nodded, but the indifferentness on his face did not move because of this name that had once shaken the entire Jia Ma Empire.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s calm manner caused Liu Ling to be startled; being able to become Pill-King Gu He\u2019s personal disciple had always been something that he was very proud of. However, in the eyes of the young man in front of him, it seemed to be nothing at all. Immediately, his eyebrows were pressed together slightly without being noticed before they immediately quickly relaxed. He smiled and asked Xiao Yan, \u201cMay I know the name of Mister Yan Xiao\u2019s teacher?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher is just an idler in the mountain and does not have a great reputation like the Pill-King Gu He has. He is not worth mentioning.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and answered faintly. His very calm manner caused Nalan Jie, Nalan Yanran and the others to give him a sidelong glance.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Yan Xiao is really humble. Even if we don\u2019t mention the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, you have become a tier two alchemist at such an age. Your teacher\u2019s ability is naturally not weak in order to be able to teach a student like you.\u201d Nalan Yanran at the side covered her mouth and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no choice. This was all forced by someone\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan stared at Nalan Yanran\u2019s pretty face and suddenly mocked himself as he spoke softly.</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran was at a momentary loss. For some unknown reason, the eyes of the other party caused her heart to quiver without realizing it. She gently shook her head and was just about to say something when Xiao Yan cupped his hands together and shook them at everyone. He smiled faintly and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I still have something to do and won\u2019t be able to accompany everyone to chat. Goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he said those words, Xiao Yan walked toward the street. After which, he gradually disappeared into the sea of people in front of the eyes of Nalan Yanran\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u201cYanran, does he really possess a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019?\u201d Seeing that Xiao Yan had disappeared, Liu Ling could not help but inquire again.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. Mister Yan Xiao\u2019s ability is quite good. His flame controlling ability would not be lousier than yours. In terms of refining pills, he is the only one of similar age whom I have met in so many years that I think may actually exceed you.\u201d Nalan Yanran nodded her head. Her pretty eyes watched the end of the street and she felt a little absentminded. For some unknown reason, this cold young man kept giving her an extremely strange feeling. This kind of feeling was something that she had never felt from Liu Ling.</p><br/><p>Liu Ling frowned as he eyed Nalan Yanran who was staring at the end of the street in a somewhat absentminded manner. His fist tensed slightly without him noticing while a faint sourness appeared in his heart...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

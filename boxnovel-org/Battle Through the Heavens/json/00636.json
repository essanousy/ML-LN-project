His heart was involuntarily overwhelmed. He really did not expect that the person who caused even the \u2018Sea Heart Flame\u2019 to be afraid of was actually this fellow!</p><br/><p>While his heart was churning, Han Feng also felt some doubt. Although Xiao Yan controlled the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019, the ranking of this flame on the \u2018Heavenly Flame Ranking\u2019 was behind that of the \u2018Sea Heart Flame\u2019. How could it cause the \u2018Sea Heart Flame\u2019 to be afraid? Such a situation did not occur two years ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly happened to this brat during these past two years?\u201d Han Feng\u2019s eyes flickered unceasingly. He could vaguely guess that such a change should be very much related with Xiao Yan\u2019s disappearance during these past two years.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I have not seen you for two years, but it is really unexpected that you have become increasingly impressive...\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s expression was volatile as he stared at Han Feng in the sky before he smiled and said, \u201cYou were lucky to keep your life back then. I wonder if you will have such luck today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng smiled with extreme anger in the face of Xiao Yan\u2019s words which were clearly offensive. He said, \u201cWhat an arrogant brat. Back then, you dared to contend with me because you borrowed some strength. What is there to be arrogant about? That old man who wouldn\u2019t die should be within your body right?\u201d</p><br/><p>With Han Feng\u2019s perception that was comparable to an elite Dou Zong, he had naturally sensed something when Xiao Yan was borrowing Yao Lao\u2019s strength back then. However, he did not have time to bother about it because he was pressed for time. After calming down during these two years, the sudden surge in Xiao Yan\u2019s strength, and the somewhat familiar Spiritual Strength had swiftly given Han Feng his answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I will use my own strength to help clean house for teacher.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled as he replied. There was a denseness in his smile which was filled with killing intent that was not hidden.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that you are not qualified, junior.\u201d Han Feng laughed coldly. Xiao Yan was still currently alive. In that case, Han Feng knew that he might no longer be able to hide the reason for Yao Lao\u2019s death. Therefore, he did not hide anything when he spoke. Moreover, he was even planning something even more vicious deep in his heart. Yao Lao might have died, but a spiritual form had remained. That ghastly and mysterious organization possessed an extremely great interest for these kinds of powerful spiritual bodies. As long as he spread this news out, that mysterious organization would naturally go and look for him. At that time, Xiao Yan would descend into a situation where his life was being unceasingly pursued.</p><br/><p>Han Feng did have some connections with that mysterious organization that specialized in the capture of spiritual bodies on the continent. His murder of Yao Lao back then was only able to succeed because of their participation. Otherwise, it would not have been possible for him to succeed alone given Yao Lao\u2019s peak strength back then even if he had the opportunity to attack Yao Lao while he was off-guard. Dou Zun. How could this so-called legendary class elite be just an empty name?</p><br/><p>The address which Han Feng had spat out from his mouth also caused the experts on both sides of the sky to be slightly startled. It was a long while later before their unusual gazes swept over both of them. Han Feng\u2019s teacher back then was Yao zun-zhe, Yao Chen, who was renowned throughout the continent back then. Despite the many years that had passed, there were still many people who firmly remembered this name that possessed a limitless fame. From the form of address which Han Feng used, it seemed that this Xiao Yan was actually the disciple of Yao zun-zhe? However, was it not rumored that Yao zun-zhe had died? How could he still have other disciples? Moreover, these two disciples not only did not have a relation such as that of brothers with the same teacher, but were instead enemies who wanted each other\u2019s life\u2026</p><br/><p>Clusters of questions without answers filled people\u2019s minds, causing their heads to be filled by a fog.</p><br/><p>Whatever the case, this form of address by Han Feng faintly caused Xiao Yan\u2019s status to suddenly rise greatly. The disciple of Yao zun-zhe. If this status were to spread, it was likely that it would cause his name to soar. After all, as an alchemist grandmaster, Yao Lao\u2019s achievements in terms of alchemy were something that not many people were able to surpass even today.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, First Elder Su Qian, may I inquire what is your motive for leading such a large group of experts to Feng City today?\u201d Han Feng\u2019s gaze turned from Xiao Yan to Su Qian by the side and asked with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of us know it very well, so why is there a need to utter such foolish words?\u201d Su Qian smiled coldly, and did not give Han Feng any face when he spoke, \u201cBack then, you led people to launch a sneak attack on my Inner Academy. You tell me if I should take revenge for that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder, your words are too grave. A \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 is born from nature. Everyone has the right to obtain it. The sealing method of the Inner Academy is not advisable. I was only hoping to allow it to escape that restrained life. What is wrong with that?\u201d Han Feng smiled. His words were dignified as though they were filled with a righteousness. However, no one present was a fool. Even the city dwellers within Feng City were noncommittal toward these words. The word righteousness did not exist in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. Only benefits to oneself would reign supreme.</p><br/><p>Su Qian glanced indifferently at Han Feng and said, \u201cI shall not argue with you. There is only one matter I am after by coming today\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDissolve the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian spoke in a calm manner. Currently, the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 was basically the strongest alliance in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. Moreover, this alliance frequently viewed the Jia Nan Academy with malice. During these two years, the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 had already become a thorn in Su Qian\u2019s heart. If he did not remove it, this thorn would cause him to feel uneasy when he slept and ate.</p><br/><p>The smile on Han Feng\u2019s face was slowly withdrawn as he laughed and shook his head. \u201cSince when has the First Elder become so childish? Does your Jia Nan Academy have the qualification to get me to dissolve the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can try.\u201d Su Qian was expressionless. He did not waste his breath as his foot slowly stepped forward. Immediately, the frightening aura of an elite Dou Zong surged out from his body. Like a dense cloud, it covered all the experts within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019.</p><br/><p>Su Qian had gathered a large group of experts to this place because he wanted to completely remove the tumor known as the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 and to wash away the previous humiliation. Hence, any words were simply a useless prelude. The final result would still be a fight that would determine the victor.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, Elder Su Qian is really impressive. Have you not suffered many disadvantages over these past two years? Yet you still stubbornly come and seek more bitterness.\u201d A strange laugh suddenly sounded. A gold figure and a silver figure rushed out from their side of the sky in a lightning-like manner, and immediately stood facing Su Qian from a distance. Two powerful auras intertwined with one another before agglomerating together and charging through the clouds, completely suppressing Su Qian\u2019s pressuring aura. Other than the so-called Gold Silver Brothers, there was no one else in this \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 who could contend with Su Qian.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince First Elder Su Qian stubbornly wants to find trouble with our \u2018Black Alliance\u2019, you should not blame us for not giving you face.\u201d Han Feng laughed coldly. His gaze immediately turned toward Xiao Yan and laughed savagely, \u201cHowever, on the account that you have presented me with such a gift, I will not let the Jia Nan Academy appear too miserable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll members of the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 listen up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng\u2019s eyes suddenly became stern as he waved his hand and cried out coldly, \u201cAs the strongest alliance within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019, it is likely that no one will want to join us if we allow these people to step on our face today. Hence, show everyone your true abilities, and let these old fellows who only know how to teach students understand that our \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 is not a softie that they can pinch as they please!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>The various heads of the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 who had become somewhat impatient responded in unison as Han Feng\u2019s voice rang out. Immediately, numerous powerful auras surged out. Their faces were filled with savage smiles as they looked at the line-up of the Jia Nan Academy outside the city. During the conflicts within these two years, the Jia Nan Academy would return dispiritedly each time they came to look for trouble. Hence, they were no longer afraid of the Jia Nan Academy like they were in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, these fellows launched a sneak attack on the Inner Academy back then and nearly destroyed our Inner Academy. We must definitely seek revenge. Today, shall be the time in which we completely end this grudge. Stake your life to fight if you don\u2019t wish to return in a miserable manner!\u201d Su Qian\u2019s cry was somewhat heavy at this moment. There was a thread within his eyes. The fights with the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 these two years were the most depressing moments in his entire life. Now that he had the help of a strong person like Xiao Yan, it was no longer farfetched to wash away this humiliation!</p><br/><p>The faces of the experts from the Inner Academy instantly became flushed red when they heard Su Qian\u2019s cry. The dispirited feeling they felt in their hearts was not any weaker than what Su Qian felt. Although there were many small repeated actions within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019, no one dared to provoke the Jia Nan Academy in this manner. However, after they suffered losses during these two years, these people from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 were becoming more arrogant. Now, they actually did not view the Inner Academy seriously. This was absolutely a kind of humiliation for those from the Inner Academy!</p><br/><p>Numerous powerful auras spread out. Although the individual auras of the experts from the Inner Academy were weaker than the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019, they were larger in number. Hence, both parties were similar in terms of the fight between auras.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, I\u2019ll leave Han Feng to you. He is an extremely critical figure. Once he manages to get rid of you, it is likely that he can influence the victory or defeat of the fight. Hence, you must delay him until I defeat the Gold Silver Brothers!\u201d Su Qian turned his head and spoke to Xiao Yan seriously, \u201cTherefore, your importance is something no one can compare with!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I won\u2019t brag and tell you that I will kill him, at the very least, he will not have the time to interfere anywhere else. I can guarantee you on this point.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled slightly and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s good! Whether our Inner Academy will once again withdraw miserably in this battle today is all up to you!\u201d Su Qian sighed in relief. He clearly understood that given Xiao Yan\u2019s character, he would definitely not say such words if he did not have the confidence.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled slightly and nodded. He raised his head and slowly locked his gaze onto Han Feng in the sky of the city. His mouth moved slightly and a voice that could only be heard by the two of them was transmitted over in an extremely soft and weak manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will take the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 within your body!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Feng\u2019s brows trembled a little. A viciousness flashed across his eyes. He slowly lifted his hand and aimed it at Xiao Yan from a distant before clenching it abruptly.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior, no matter what happens, you will not leave this place today!\u201d</p><br/><p>A savage smile was contained at the corner of Han Feng\u2019s smouth. He immediately tilted his head and a faint voice reverberated in the sky. It completely caused the anxious swords-drawn atmosphere to erupt!</p><br/><p>\u201cKill them! Don\u2019t show any mercy!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He nodded a moment later and descended into a deep thought after returning the scroll to the ring. These medicinal ingredients were quite rare. It was likely that one would spend quite a lot of time in order to gather all of them. It seemed that he would need to look for Old Hai regarding the matter involving these medicinal ingredients. Being in possession of the largest auction house within the empire, it naturally had an unusually rich store. Although these medicinal ingredients were rare, it should be possible to gather some of them.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out a gentle sigh of relief when he thought of this. He flipped his body and descended from the stone bed before slowly walking out of the chamber.</p><br/><p>He had just walked out of the room when a female servant, who had been waiting outside for a long time, hurried forward. After which, she spoke respectfully, \u201cThird Young Master, First Young Master said to invite you to the living room should you exit from the chamber.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly upon hearing this. He waved his hand to dismiss the female servant before striding to the living room.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan appeared outside the living room after around ten minutes. He heard the voices of Xiao Ding and Xiao Li transmitted from within it. There was also a lady\u2019s voice that was not unfamiliar in this place. Upon identifying it, Xiao Yan was clear that the person inside seemed to be the eldest princess Yao Ye from the imperial family.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is she doing here?\u201d Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes before pushing open the door to walk in.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ding and Xiao Li were chatting and smiling with Yao Ye in the living room. They lifted their gazes when they heard the sound of a door being pushed, only to see Xiao Yan enter. The smile on their faces became much denser.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, Mister Xiao Yan, it is really not easy to get to see you. Yao Ye has come over a couple of times during these few days but only managed to meet you this time around.\u201d A slight smile surfaced on Yao Ye\u2019s pretty face upon seeing Xiao Yan enter. She stood up and joked to the former.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. His eyes made contact with Xiao Ding and Xiao Li. After which, he found a chair beside the two of them and sat before speaking with a smile, \u201cMay I know the reason why Princess Yao Ye is here this time around?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Xiao Yan has helped our imperial family remove a scourge. Do we still need any reason to come and visit?\u201d Yao Ye\u2019s pretty eyes paused on Xiao Yan and laughed in a somewhat restrained manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. He immediately ceased speaking. He picked up the teacup by his side and took a sip before lifting his gaze slightly to stare at Yao Ye. He did not believe that the other party was truly here to visit because of his injuries.</p><br/><p>The smile on Yao Ye\u2019s pretty face was maintained for some while Xiao Yan stared at her. Finally, she could only scatter it helplessly. She mused for a moment before speaking in a slow manner, \u201cI heard that mister Xiao Yan is planning to establish a faction within the Jia Ma Empire?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy Xiao clan has quite a number of enemies. It is only natural that one must have sufficient strength if I wanted to protect the clan members.\u201d Xiao Yan did not hide this matter as he faintly replied.</p><br/><p>Yao Ye\u2019s eyes intently studied Xiao Yan. A moment later, she softly said, \u201cOur imperial family will not object to mister Xiao Yan establishing a faction. We can even lend you a hand. However, I hope that the matter of the Misty Cloud Sect will not happen again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes upon hearing the solemness within Yao Ye\u2019s words. Since the other party had already made her words clear, there was also no longer any need for him to dodge the matter. He immediately spoke in a deep voice, \u201cPrincess Yao Ye you can rest assured. Xiao Yan is not Yun Shan. As long as the imperial family does not secretly meddle with my Xiao clan, Xiao Yan will remember the favor of the imperial family.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Ye quietly sighed in relief within her heart when she looked at Xiao Yan\u2019s grave face. She smiled and said, \u201cYao Ye naturally believes in Mister Xiao Yan\u2019s character. Now that the Misty Cloud Sect had been disband, the Jia Ma Empire is also in need of a powerful faction to become the representative of the Jia Ma Empire. From the looks of the situation now, Mister Xiao Yan is naturally the best choice.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and said, \u201cIt is naturally for the best that the imperial family does not oppose. All of us once fought beside each other. I, too, do not wish to turn our relationship into an extremely stiff one because of some issues. That is not good for anyone\u2026 as for the matter regarding the establishment of a faction, I will speak to princess Yao Ye in detail if there is any news of it in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Ye nodded and said, \u201cIn that case, I will quietly wait for positive news.\u201d Yao Ye stood up after she spoke. She waved her hand and ten jade boxes appeared on the top of the table. She smiled and said, \u201cAll of these are things that great-grandfather asked me to bring over. Mister Xiao Yan, you yourself are quite a high tiered Alchemist. I think that there should not be much trouble with regards to the injuries within your body. Moreover, these medicinal ingredients might be of some use to you. There are still matters in the imperial city so I shall not stay any longer. Goodbye.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Ye turned around and slowly left once those words sounded. A moment later, she disappeared from the sight of Xiao Yan and the others.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sent princess Yao Ye off with his gaze before he stood up and came to the side of the table. He opened those jade boxes and a rich medicinal fragrance immediately pounced over, causing his brows to raise a little. The imperial family was indeed generous.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that the imperial family does not have much conflict with this matter.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and spoke as his gaze glanced over the jade boxes. Although the current Xiao Yan was unafraid of the imperial family when comparing experts, but the latter was still an actual controller of a country. It would still be somewhat troublesome to come into conflict with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not that they do not have much contradiction to the idea, but it is because there are quite a number of experts beside Xiao Yan whom they feared. Otherwise, they would definitely have done everything they could do to stop us.\u201d Xiao Ding laughed faintly. The imperial family of the Jia Ma Empire was naturally much more afraid and cautious after the matter of the Misty Cloud Sect.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also smiled slightly after hearing the conversations of the two people. He said, \u201cIt is fine if they do not have any other thoughts no matter what happened. In this way, we will avoid a lot of trouble while establishing a faction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Ding nodded slightly. He immediately spoke in a slow manner, \u201cFor the establishment of a faction that you have mentioned, I suggest that you gather the few large clans within the empire and the Alchemist Association and form an alliance faction. In this way, it would enable the faction to expand greatly within a short period of time. It would also avoid the beginning stages and the most troublesome steps. Moreover, now that we have the support of the imperial family, we will be able to absorb some new blood with good training talent from the Jia Ma Empire in the future. It is a great advantage to us in the long term.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, Qi Methods and Dou Techniques cannot be lacking if one wants to groom experts that belong to the alliance. We can try to see if we can get the few large factions to provide these together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust leave the things like Qi Methods and Dou Techniques to me. Big brother, you can just do as you want with regards to the establishment of the faction. I do not specialize in these things.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled. After obtaining the treasures of Han Feng and Yao Lao one after the other, it did not seem to be any problem for him to provide some Qi Methods and Dou Techniques.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ding helplessly shook his head when he heard Xiao Yan\u2019s words. He said, \u201cYou little fellow. You are actually thinking of becoming a person in charge who does nothing now\u2026 that\u2019s right, how are your injuries?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should be able to make a complete recovery after a couple of days.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled as he replied.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ding and Xiao Li sighed in relief upon hearing this. The latter raised his head and laughed, \u201cI might head to the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 once your injuries are recovered. After all, the \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 there needs me to manage. Otherwise, everyone in \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 will have left the next time I return.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye. From what the both of you have said, that \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 possesses some of the freshest individuals that the Jia Nan Academy provides. Its future potential is definitely going to be quite strong. Although the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 is chaotic, there is quite a big profit to be made from it. If it is possible to expand \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 in the future and successfully occupy a certain position within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019, it is likely that it will be a frightening faction. Once we wait until the faction within the Jia Ma Empire develops in the future and then merge the two, we would definitely be able to contend with the first-rate factions within the Dou Qi continent.\u201d Xiao Ding voiced his thoughts.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also nodded slightly. Students who were able to graduate from the Inner Academy were mostly people with great training talent. If it was possible to gather them and get them to become their subordinates, it was likely that they would be an elite force with plenty of potential. He never possessed any doubt toward the potential of the \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019.</p><br/><p>A female servant hurriedly walked in just as Xiao Yan and his two brothers were discussing. She respectfully spoke from the doorway, \u201cYoung Master Xiao Yan. Nalan xiao-jie (Young Miss) is at the main entrance saying that she has something important to say and needs to meet you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this. Nalan xiao-jie was naturally Nalan Yanran. Why was she looking for him?</p><br/><p>\u201cInvite her in.\u201d Doubt flashed across his eyes as Xiao Yan softly commanded.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, is it Nalan Yanran? Speaking of which, big brother and I have not seen this person who had nearly become our sister-in-law\u2026\u201d Xiao Li\u2019s voice was suddenly cold as he looked at the back of the female servant who had left. It seemed that he bore a grudge over how Nalan Yanran had canceled the engagement back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose grudges have already been resolved three years ago. There is no need to keep it in your heart.\u201d Xiao Ding knit his brows and spoke in a deep voice. It seemed that he was quite displeased at Xiao Li for mentioning this matter in front of Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li shrugged his shoulders and ceased speaking. He leaned against his chair and his gaze lazily swept over the main entrance.</p><br/><p>The three people waited in the hall for a moment before the female servant from earlier came over. Behind her was a graceful, partially-visible figure.</p><br/><p>The two figures paused at the entrance. That female servant bowed and withdrew while Nalan Yanran, whose body was wrapped in cloud-colored clothes, slowly approached. Her gaze swept over the three people in the living room before finally pausing on Xiao Yan with a somewhat chaotic expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cNalan xiao-jie, is there a reason for you to visit the Xiao clan?\u201d Xiao Yan gently placed down his teacup. His eyes were lowered as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran bit her lower red lip with the back of her teeth in the face of this cold and indifferent manner of Xiao Yan. She finally opened her mouth a moment later, \u201cTeacher wishes to see you one last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee me one last time?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes narrowed. He slowly clenched his fist and his voice had gradually turned dense and cold, \u201cYou better not tell me that she has done something foolish. I already told you that I can still find all the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s disciples despite them having been scattered!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nalan Yanran\u2019s eyebrows were bunched up together. She said, \u201cTeacher will not do that kind of thing. Follow me if you are willing to see her. There might not be any chance in the future if you are unwilling.\u201d Nalan Yanran did not wait for Xiao Yan to reply after she spoke. She turned around and walked out of the mansion.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan knit his brows. A moment later, he stood up and threw his gaze to Xiao Li by the side. He tossed with his hand and a scroll was thrown to the latter, \u201cSecond brother, you should try to gather all of these medicinal ingredients. I have a great use for them. Do not delay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Li was startled when he received the scroll. He saw the flickering in Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze and seemed to have understood something. He immediately nodded without leaving a trace.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan spoke a couple of words to the two of them after handing the scroll to Xiao Li. He immediately followed Nalan Yanran out with quick footsteps. The words that she brought caused his face to quietly become a little gloomy. What was she thinking of doing again?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

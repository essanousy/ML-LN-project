Among them, they emitted soft laughter and had numerous private conversations.</p><br/><p>\u201cMake way, make way. Elder Liu is coming through.\u201d A cry suddenly sounded from outside the crowd. Immediately, the crowd hurriedly split and formed a small path. Within this tower the position of an Elder was the greatest. Whoever dared to offend them would not come to a good end. By just randomly borrowing some of the power of the position to obstruct you, he could cause you to have no tears left to cry, even if you wanted to.</p><br/><p>As the human crowd parted, an old man in simple and rough clothes slowly walked in. That smiling gaze of his swept across Xiao Yan\u2019s and Wu Hao\u2019s stiffened and unmoving bodies. He laughed and said, \u201cThere are really two little fellows who didn\u2019t know the might of the heavens and the earth (overestimate their abilities). They actually did not even bother to first report their initial attempt at entering the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.\u2019 This hardship is something that they will suffer unduly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, there are always reckless new students every year who impatiently enter the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.\u2019 They deserve to suffer this hardship\u2026\u201d A gloating laughter erupted from the human crowd. Although the training speed within the tower was rather fast, it was, after all, still a little boring. These older students were naturally happy to see the situation in front of them, new students entering and providing them some entertainment.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe new students have just entered the Inner Academy. It is only natural that they were unaware of the rules here. What is there to laugh about?\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint, clear voice suddenly rang out. Everyone\u2019s gaze immediately followed the voice and took a look, only to see a young lady wearing a silver-colored dress. The young lady was tall. Her face may have appeared skinny, but it was that of a rare beauty. Her skin was white as snow and her eyebrows were like a painting. The thing that caused people the greatest surprise was that this lady\u2019s long hair, which gathered at her waist, was actually a rare silver color. The silver-colored hair matched her silver-colored dress, causing her entire body to release a faint, cold disposition that repelled people such that they were thousands of kilometers away from her. It caused others to have a feeling of being able to see from afar, but unable to touch.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gazes swept across this silver dressed woman while maintaining their silence. Their eyes initially flashed with adoration that a man would have for a woman. However, there was also fear mixed in with that adoration.</p><br/><p>After this silver-dressed lady opened her mouth, the gloating laughter nearly disappeared immediately. From this, it could be seen that this lady should belong to a powerful faction. Otherwise, in this place where strength was honored, just her pretty appearance was insufficient to cause people around to be afraid.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, it is actually Yue girl. This old me actually did not see you earlier. This is a group of people who are so free that they are in need of a beating. What is there to talk to them about?\u201d That Elder Liu also turned his gaze toward the silver-dressed lady when he heard the voice. He was slightly startled before he immediately laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Liu.\u201d</p><br/><p>That silver-dressed lady did not maintain her cold indifferentness when faced with Elder Liu. A faint epiphyllum-like smile appeared on her face, causing the surrounding students to be a little absent-minded when they saw this smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue girl, which level do you intend to enter during this visit?\u201d Elder Liu glanced at the stiffened bodies of Xiao Yan and Wu Hao before he immediately smiled and asked the silver-dressed lady. His attitude was clearly much friendlier than when treating other students.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sixth level.\u201d The lady in the silver dress hesitated a little before replying.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sixth level? That is a level that one must have the strength of a six star Dou Ling before entering. Don\u2019t tell me that Senior Han Yue has already reached such a level?\u201d The lady\u2019s words immediately caused waves of surprised wows to be emitted from the surrounding crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh?\u201d That Elder Liu was also somewhat surprised at the reply of the silver-dressed lady. His eyes, which had a hidden glint, slowly swept over the latter\u2019s body. A moment later, he sighed, \u201cLooks like within a few years, you, girl, will have the qualification to run for the rank of an Elder in the Inner Academy. This kind of training talent and speed really cause people to be amazed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is all thanks to the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.\u2019 If I were to train by myself, it is likely that I would, at the very most, have just entered the Dou Ling class.\u201d The silver-dressed lady shook her head. She immediately turned her gaze toward Xiao Yan and Wu Hao in the crowd. She parted her red lips slightly, \u201cElder Liu, why don\u2019t you first remove these people from being grilled by the Heart Flame. Otherwise, there may be quite a lot of damage to their bodies if you\u2019re too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liu shook his head when he heard this. He smiled and said, \u201cLet\u2019s wait awhile. Girl, how long did you endure being grilled by the Heart Flame when you first entered the \u2018Blazing Flame Qi Refining Tower\u2019 back then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Yue\u2019s eyebrows were knit slightly. She mused for a moment before saying, \u201cSeventeen minutes. Moreover, that was because there was someone who warned me beforehand when I was entering the tower.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen one first enters the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,\u2019 it is actually possible to judge one\u2019s potential. Since all the new students don\u2019t know how to cause the Heart Flame to disappear when they are first burned by it, therefore, those who can endure longer meant that their resistance to the Heart Flame is stronger. This is a great benefit toward them when they enter and train within the tower in the future. Of course, nothing is absolute. This cannot be considered to be absolutely accurate. However, it can be considered a vague test\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liu smiled and replied, \u201cCurrently these two people appeared to have endured for eight minutes already, right? Ah. This can already be considered not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Su wants to test their limits.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, let\u2019s try\u2026 if I guess correctly, this black-robed young man should be that Xiao Yan, the little fellow who led this year\u2019s new students in this \u2018Fire Energy Hunting Competition\u2019 and defeated all the older students, including both \u2018Black White Evil Stopper\u2019 groups. Recently, he is also frequently mentioned among us Elders.\u201d Elder Liu glanced at the enormous Heavy Xuan Ruler behind Xiao Yan\u2019s back and smiled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is that Xiao Yan?\u201d Hearing Elder Liu\u2019s words, not only the surrounding older students emitted numerous exclamations, but a surprise also flashed across the pupils of the cold and indifferent Han Yue.</p><br/><p>Elder Liu nodded with a smile. His gaze paused on Xiao Yan and Wu Hao. Both of his hands were inserted in his sleeves as he waited for the arrival of their limit.</p><br/><p>\u201cYue girl, if you have something to do, then please descend the tower. It is alright with just me here.\u201d As Elder Liu waited, he was afraid of delaying Han Yue\u2019s training time. Thus, he smiled and encouraged her to go.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. I also want to see just how long this new student, who has quite a great reputation even before he entered the Inner Academy, can endure.\u201d Han Yue shook her head slightly. A pair of cool eyes swept over Xiao Yan and Wu Hao. During these few days, she had also heard quite a lot of news regarding this batch of new students. They were able to defeat all the older students group in the \u2018Fire Energy Hunting Competition\u2019 while something like this never seemed to have appeared during these recent years. Hence, she had some interest in the leader of the new students, whom she had heard of but never met.</p><br/><p>Of course, she was not the only one who had such interests. After hearing Elder Liu revealing Xiao Yan\u2019s identity, the surrounding older students, who originally wanted to leave, similarly paused their footsteps. Each of them threw gazes, which contained various emotions, toward the two people present. They also wanted to see whether these fellows the strength they were rumored to have.</p><br/><p>Due to some people spreading Xiao Yan\u2019s identity, there were older students who repeatedly came over during the waiting time. Hence, the circle grew increasingly larger. If it were not for the space within this tower being extremely spacious, it was likely that congestion would really be formed.</p><br/><p>As time slowly flowed by, the shock in the eyes of these observers around also grew increasingly rich. This was because until this moment, both of them had actually endured for fourteen minutes. Moreover, their faces looked like burning charcoal but they did not appear to have reached their limit.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot bad indeed\u2026\u201d Elder Liu pulled at his beard and nodded with a smile. His eyes also contained some admiration.</p><br/><p>Time continued to flow. However, at the sixteen minute mark, Wu Hao\u2019s body suddenly trembled slightly. Seeing this scene, the surrounding students knew clearly that it was likely that Wu Hao had reached his limit.</p><br/><p>Seeing his reaction, Elder Liu extended his eagle-claw like, shriveled right hand. He aimed at Wu Hao\u2019s body, which had just begun to tremble, across the empty air. On the tip of his finger was a wisp of creamy white flames which slowly surfaced. The flames agglomerated at the tip of his finger to finally form a repeatedly rotating spinning fire.</p><br/><p>Elder Liu\u2019s finger gently flicked the spinning fire. He saw the spinning fire swiftly leave his hand and suspended a foot away from Wu Hao\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liu\u2019s palm rotated slightly as he let out a soft cry. One could only see the cream-colored flame swiftly spinning and waves of suction force spread out. Finally, under the pulling force of this flame, a wisp of somewhat twisted invisible flames were forcefully pulled from Wu Hao\u2019s heart. Finally, it was sucked into the spinning flame and forcefully crushed into nothingness.</p><br/><p>As that wisp of invisible flame left his body, Wu Hao\u2019s trembling body immediately stilled. His feet became weak, and his butt sank to the ground. The burning charcoal expression also swiftly disappeared. He was panting coarsely, like a wild bull, emitting a \u2018hu hu\u2019 sound. At this moment, his body and spirit were in an extremely exhausted condition and he did not have the slightest mood to look at the crowd around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, sixteen minutes. Moreover this is after being eroded by the Heart Flame without any precautions. This result is not bad.\u201d Elder Liu smiled and praised as he eyed Wu Hao, who was seated on the ground, \u201cThis batch of new students seems to really be a little stronger than previous batches.\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Yue who stood nearby also nodded. The endurance of this new student for the Heart Flame might have exceeded hers by one head. After all, although she had endured for seventeen minutes, there was someone who had told her what she should do when she first entered the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.\u2019 This was why she could endure for so long. Hence, she could have been considered to have cheated.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Xiao Yan\u2026 is actually able to continue enduring? This kind of fire resistance could even be comparable to that fellow\u2026\u201d Han Yue\u2019s pupils once again shifted toward Xiao Yan, whose eyes were still shut, as she muttered in a soft shocked manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder he was able to lead the new students to defeat the older student groups. This little fellow does indeed have some ability.\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Su smiled as he eyed Xiao Yan, who was still enduring without displaying any signs of having reached his limit. His hands were once again inserted into his sleeves as he said, \u201cGood. Today, the old me wants to see just how long you can actually endure.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, these words of Elder Liu had just sounded when everyone saw Xiao Yan\u2019s body suddenly tremble. Only then did they sigh in relief within their hearts. Fortunately, this fellow did not do anything as shockingly similar as when he led the new students to defeat the older students. Otherwise, it would be too much of a blow to those who had endured for less than ten minutes back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Elder Liu was startled when he saw this. He immediately shook his head in disappointment as he laughed bitterly, \u201cMy expectations were indeed a little too high\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Liu, it has been nearly eighteen minutes. This kind of resistance toward the Heart Flame is already considered great. One can hardly find anyone like this within the Inner Academy.\u201d Seeing Elder Liu\u2019s eyes, Han Yue could not help but speak in a helpless manner. Did the words he say not cause the other students to feel ashamed in their hearts?</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, it is indeed very good\u2026\u201d Elder Liu laughed in an embarrassed manner. He waved his hand and a cream white-colored spinning fire surfaced. He flicked his finger and the spinning fire once again stopped in front of Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>The faint, cream white fire shone on Xiao Yan\u2019s ember red face until he appeared a little strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another soft cry sounded. The spinning fire suddenly spun wildly. However, at this moment, something that caused people to be stunned appeared extremely abruptly!</p><br/><p>As the spinning fire spun, the invisible flames, similar to what everyone expected to see did not appear. Instead, after being dull for an instant, a large cluster of green-colored flames suddenly came surging out of Xiao Yan\u2019s body without any forewarning. Finally, it formed a green-colored wave. In one gulp, it swallowed the cream white-colored flames belonging to Elder Liu.</p><br/><p>Not only did the white-colored flame fail to successfully forcefully crush the Green Flame like it did earlier, but was instead swallowed without being able to resist. This strange scene caused the surrounding students to be stunned.</p><br/><p>After the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 swallowed the cream-colored flame, it did not immediately disappear. When no one controlled it, it appeared to have the function to automatically protect its owner. Hence, after it swallowed the cream-colored flame, which posed as a threat toward Xiao Yan, it moved in the direction of the attacking breath, and directly swept toward Elder Liu. The energy, which instantly erupted not only caused the surrounding students to become pale from the shock, but also caused Elder Liu\u2019s face to move a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cMove aside!\u201d</p><br/><p>The green-colored flame came sweeping over. When Elder Liu felt its indiscriminate attack, he hurriedly cried out loudly.</p><br/><p>Hearing Elder Liu\u2019s cry, the surrounding students hurriedly pulled back. In an instant, the inner region of the tower became chaotic. One by one, numerous human figures hurriedly pulled back. They were afraid that the green-colored flame of unknown source would sweep them up.</p><br/><p>Elder Liu\u2019s face became solemn when he saw the green-colored flame sweeping toward him. He waved both his hands and a cream-colored flame was spat out from his hand. Finally, it swiftly formed a fire barrier. He flung his hand and covered Xiao Yan and the green-colored flame, which had come sweeping over, within it.</p><br/><p>The green-colored flame still came chasing over endlessly. Finally, under everyone\u2019s gaze, it collided with that cream-colored flame barrier.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment they came into contact, a wild, violent energy wave surged out, shaking the fire barrier until it trembled swiftly. The enormous, explosive sound carried a turbulent heat wave as it shook the entire \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 until it began to quiver a little!</p><br/><p>Before Han Yue\u2019s body pulled back, Dou Qi had swiftly agglomerated into an energy barrier of light on her body. Ripples were repeatedly formed on the energy barrier when she received the residual wave of the energy attack. It was fortunate that it did not cause her body any harm...</p><br/><p>Han Yue\u2019s body swiftly pulled back dozens of steps. Only when she heard the loud sound gradually fading did she hurriedly throw her gaze over to where the explosion occurred. She was slightly startled after seeing that clear scene. She immediately opened her mouth slightly. Her heart was filled with astonishment.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It was difficult to imagine that Xiao Li, someone who almost no one could match in the company, would actually be mysteriously defeated by Xiao Yan, who was younger than him by seven or eight years.</p><br/><p>Within the battleground, Xiao Li stared at the tip of the spear and was stunned for a long while before he finally recovered. His gaze swept across the smiling Xiao Yan in front of him and clicked his tongue as he shook his head. He sighed, \u201cLittle boy, how unexpected. You have hid so well. The strength that you had displayed does not appear to be merely that of a normal one star Dou Shi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I was merely lucky.\u201d Shaking his head while laughing, Xiao Yan inserted the spear into the ground and then headed to where the Heavy Xuan Ruler was a short distance away. He was about to lift it up when Xiao Li beside him stopped him with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me try. This ruler\u2026 seems a little strange.\u201d Xiao Li curiously stared at the huge ruler on the ground and laughed as he said.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Yan was slightly at a loss, but he quickly smiled at nodded his head. He took a step back while his gaze somewhat mocking.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li rubbed his hands and gradually stood by the Heavy Xuan Ruler\u2019s side. His hand gripped the ruler, then tightly grabbed it. After letting out a breath, he carelessly pulled with his hand. When his hand pulled, Xiao Li\u2019s expression changed and he let out a shocked cry. He realized that ever since the Heavy Xuan Ruler entered his hand, the swift surging lightning Dou Qi in his body had suddenly been reduced to the speed of a turtle\u2019s jog\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, there really is something strange\u2026\u201d Mumbling in a stunned voice, Xiao Li tightened his arm. Numerous veins began pulsing on the crook of his arm.</p><br/><p>Tightly holding the Heavy Xuan Ruler, Xiao Li\u2019s face gradually turned red as he let out a soft cry, \u201cUp!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the cry fell, Xiao Li\u2019s arm trembled as it slowly lifted up. After which, his two hands firmly grasped the ruler in front of him and waved it left and right with all his strength. Afterwards, the gaze Xiao Li used to look at Xiao Yan had some faint shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you were actually carrying this just now to fight with me?\u201d Seeing the smile on the delicate and handsome face of Xiao Yan, Xiao Li\u2019s mouth was dry as he said. God, it was already very amazing that one can even carry this and move around smoothly. Yet, Xiao Yan actually carried this and exchanged quite a number of blows with Xiao Li during their fight. How could this not cause Xiao Li to be astonished and stunned?</p><br/><p>Eyeing Xiao Li\u2019s astonished manner, Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. His palm received the Heavy Xuan Ruler and easily placed it onto his back.</p><br/><p>With his eyes staring intently at Xiao Yan\u2019s action, Xiao Li realized that when Xiao Yan received the Heavy Xuan Ruler, his hand had merely sunk a little. The instant after it sunk, the small dop was once again perfectly adjusted.</p><br/><p>Seeing the relaxed manner of Xiao Yan, Xiao Li\u2019s mouth opened. It was a long while later before he sighed in shock and shook his head. \u201cLittle boy, how outstanding\u2026 have those eyes of Nalan Yanran been blinded? How many in the Jia Ma Empire can be considered as outstanding as my brother? She actually thinks you aren\u2019t good enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled, waved his hand and said, \u201cAt the very least, Xun Er will not be weaker than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXun Er? Haha. That girl. I haven\u2019t been back for so many years, but that girl must have become very charming, no? It should be known that when she was small, those young masters in Wu Tan City came to the walls of the Xiao Clan to take a look at her. But she seemed to stick to you. Hee hee.\u201d Hearing the elegant name, Xiao Li stilled momentarily before he smiled and said yearningly.</p><br/><p>Recalling the young lady\u2019s beautiful face and moving figure, Xiao Yan also gently smiled emotionally. His hand lightly patted the Heavy Xuan Ruler and smiled, \u201cIf there is a chance in the future, I will bring her to visit you. Ah\u2026 but now, I have some important matters that need both Big Brother\u2019s and Second Brother\u2019s help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? There\u2019s something? No problem! Just tell us. Even if it is beyond our ability, Big Brother and Second Brother will do our best to help.\" When Xiao Li heard Xiao Yan, he immediately waved his hand and smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d With a smile, Xiao Yan nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u2026..</p><br/><p>The three of them sat within a spacious room while Qing Li carefully carried three cups of tea to distribute to each of them before obediently standing behind Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, Xiao-Yan-Zi, you have some problem? Just say it out and let Big Brother analyze it for you.\u201d Xiao Ding smiled and said to Xiao Yan as he lifted his teacup to take a sip.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded with a smile before musing for awhile. In a soft voice, he said, \u2018The reason for me coming to the Tager Desert is to search for something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething? What thing?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Li asked curiously with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly Flame\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan whispered as his finger lightly tapped on the table.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d When the words \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 were said, the room immediately became much quieter. Xiao Ding and Xiao Li exchanged gazes before asking in a puzzled voice, \u201c\u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019? That kind of thing seems to be something only an Alchemist would need. What do you need it for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders and smiled indifferently, \u201cBecause I am an Alchemist.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Ding and Xiao Li\u2019s faces stiffened. A moment later, an unrestrained joy surfaced, \u201cYou are an Alchemist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, I was lucky to possess the talent for becoming an alchemist and when I was at Wu Tan City, I also met a teacher, so\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk\u2026 incredible. I never expected that our Xiao Clan would also produce an alchemist. Ha ha.\u201d Seeing that Xiao Yan nodded his head and admitting, Xiao Ding and Xiao Li immediately laughed out loud. Their laughter contained both envy and satisfaction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019s\u2019 rarity is so great that it is a little frightening. Although we have muddled along in the Rock Desert City for a long time, we have really not heard anyone mentioning anything about where there are traces of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019.\u201d After rejoicing, Xiao Ding frowned and helplessly said.</p><br/><p>Shaking his head with a smile, Xiao Yan tapped his finger on the storage ring, withdrew a piece of an old goatskin scroll and placed it on the table. His finger pointed at a flame symbol on it and said softly, \u201cThis is a map that I managed to obtain. At this region marked by the flame symbol, there should be a higher chance of finding traces of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. However, I am unfamiliar with the surrounding terrain of the Rock Desert City, thus\u2026 I cannot find the exact place marked by the Flame Symbol. Big Brother, the two of you been around here for quite some time. Do you know of any strange places around the Rock Desert City?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Ding pulled over the map. His gaze roughly swept over the map before he said with surprise, \u201cWhat a detailed map. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen such a map.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it\u2019s so detailed it is a little overboard.\u201d Xiao Li nodded his head. He frowned and studied the map in detail before saying softly, \u201cThe place marked by the flame symbol seems to be at to the east of Rock Desert City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. More accurately speaking, it should be a little south-east of Rock Desert City.\u201d Xiao Ding nodded his head. He voiced his thoughts, \u201cBut the east side of the Rock Desert City does not seem to have any strange places.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s indeed nothing. I have once brought people to search that place for a few days during one of our missions but I did not find any strange places.\u201d Xiao Li also shook his head and said helplessly.</p><br/><p>Seeing the two of them shake their head, disappointment rose on Xiao Yan\u2019s face. It appeared that there was no trace of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 there\u2026</p><br/><p>However, just as Xiao Yan was filled with disappointment, a gentle voice suddenly sounded within the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat...Young Master, the east side of the Rock Desert City\u2026 seems to have something strange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan stilled. He quickly turned around and stared at Qing Lin who was twisting her small hands under his searing gaze. He hurriedly said, \u201cDo you know something?\u201d</p><br/><p>To the side, Xiao Ding and Xiao Li also shifted their stunned gaze toward Qing Lin. Clearly, they were not informed.</p><br/><p>Being the center of attention of the three gazes in the room, the timidness on Qing Lin\u2019s small face grew. She said haltingly, \u201cI am also unsure if my senses are accurate\u2026 but half a year ago, I really sensed that there was some unusual movement at a region to the east of the Rock Desert City.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do you know about it? You don\u2019t seem to possess such a strength.\u201d Xiao Ding\u2019s palm rubbed his tea cup as he said with suspicion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know. Half a year ago, I sensed a very strong Qi that appeared outside Rock Desert City. That Qi\u2026 and the blood in my body, seemed to be a little similar. Even the Company Leader of the Sand Mercenary Company is very weak compared to that Qi.\u201d Qing Lin carefully stuck herself tightly to Xiao Yan as she whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Hearing this, Xiao Ding and Xiao Li were a little uneasy. The Company Leader of the Sand Mercenary Company was a Da Dou Shi. If even he was much weaker than the mysterious person. That\u2026 Did that mean that the other party was at least at the Dou Huang level?</p><br/><p>\u201cA Qi that is similar to your bloodline? Don\u2019t tell me it is Queen Medusa?\u201d After musing for a while, Xiao Li suddenly said in a shocked voice. With Queen Medusa\u2019s strength, it should not be too hard for her to turn the Rock Desert City into ashes. This kind of extremely terrifying person had actually roamed the area surrounding Rock Desert City without anyone knowing?</p><br/><p>When the name \u2018Queen Medusa\u2019 entered his ears, Xiao Ding\u2019s expression also changed slightly. Around the Tager Desert, this name was as renowned as Pill-King Gu He was within the Jia Ma Empire.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d Qing Lin shook her head. She whispered, \u201cI could only vaguely sense it. Half a year ago, she had suddenly arrived somewhere to the east of Rock Desert City. There, she seemed to have stayed for a night. During the night, the Qi to the east was extremely irritable. I also know that when she left, she seemed to have been injured\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Qing Lin narrating the tale, Xiao Yan sighed lightly. His eyes narrowed as he said softly, \u201cCan you be certain of the exact location where she stayed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI should be. Although half a year has passed, the Qi that she had left behind is pretty dense. I\u2026 I can rely on the bloodline in me\u2026 I should be able to find that place.\u201d When she mentioned her bloodline, Qing Lin\u2019s face clearly became a little dejected. However, she maintained a forceful smile as she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Young Master wants to go, Qing Lin will try her best to bring you there!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, thank you very much Qing Lin\u2026 Let\u2019s go and take a look tomorrow. I hope the results won\u2019t disappoint me.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded as he said softly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The Dou Qi within his body madly followed his veins and surged onto his fist. Finally, it smashed ruthlessly toward Yun Shan\u2019s heart. It was just about to strike its target when a sharp female cry suddenly sounded from the open ground below.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>The familiar voice caused Xiao Yan\u2019s fist to pause. His gaze involuntarily shifted down and immediately saw Yun Yun\u2019s pretty pale-white face that was filled with a plea.</p><br/><p>The state of mind of Xiao Yan that was filled with killing intent began to tremble a little when he saw the pretty pale-white face that was covered with a pleading look. He was not totally unaffected by the words and actions of this woman\u2026</p><br/><p>The time over the entire sky appeared to have stilled at this moment. A countless number of gazes stared intently at the young man in the sky without blinking. His next action would determine the fate of the Misty Cloud Sect!</p><br/><p>The fists of Hai Bodong and the others were clenched tightly. They almost involuntarily felt like jumping on the spot the moment they saw Xiao Yan\u2019s punch stopped by Yun Yun\u2019s sharp cry. As long as he ruthlessly gave the punch at this moment, they would truly win this bet of theirs where they had given all that they had.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive the blow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jia Xing Tian, Hai Bodong ,and the others were staring with big eyes amid this silent sky. Their breathing gradually became rough and their faces were completely flushed because of the anxiety in their hearts. The veins on their hands pulsed, appearing extremely shocking. However, they did not dare to emit the slightest sound at this moment despite the unusual anxiety in their hearts. They could only roar out loud with all their might within their hearts.</p><br/><p>Most of the factions had gambled their entire clan in today\u2019s big battle. They would undoubtedly gain great benefits if they won. However, if they were to unluckily lose, they would truly have to face the danger of the destruction of their clans.</p><br/><p>Yet, this so-called victory was all determined by this one punch by Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>They would win the bet if the punch fell!</p><br/><p>They would lose if the punch was withdrawn. Moreover, once Yun Shan managed to catch his breath after this instant, a great shocking change might occur in the subsequent battle!</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s gaze in the sky a short distance away was also focused intently on Xiao Yan, whose eyes were flickering. He did not make any noise to interrupt him. Yao Lao knew that this young man, whom he had watched growing up, would not disappoint him.</p><br/><p>The sky was silent. A countless number of gazes that contained various emotions crossed each other in the sky. They were all waiting for the final ending of this big battle today!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s lowered gaze paused on Yun Yun\u2019s pitiful pale-white face. An instant gentleness appeared in his eyes at that instant.</p><br/><p>The transformation of the glint in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes was clearly absorbed into Yun Yun\u2019s eyes. The paleness on her face immediately became fainter. She knew that by speaking and interrupting Xiao Yan at this moment, she was a little rude and unreasonable without caring for the other party\u2019s feeling. However, no matter how one put it, she was a member of the Misty Cloud Sect. That Yun Shan was her teacher who had personally groom her. Although Yun Shan\u2019s actions these few years caused their relationship to fade greatly, this was not enough of a reason for Yun Yun to personally witness Yun Shan being killed by Xiao Yan\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan suddenly withdrew his gaze just as the paleness on Yun Yun\u2019s face became a little fainter. The gentleness within his eyes instantly disappeared. Replacing it was an extremely dense hatred and killing intent. He had already said that no one could stop him from killing Yun Shan, even if this person were Yun Yun, who had a complicated relationship with him!</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Yun, there must be someone who has to repay the blood debt of the Xiao clan! A blood debt must be repaid by blood. Everyone can forget about escaping from it.\u201d</p><br/><p>An indifferent voice was softly emitted from Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth before drifting over the entire open ground.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun\u2019s somewhat less pale face had instantly turned colorless when this voice sounded. Her lovely body trembled and a mist appeared within her eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly became stern after his soft voice sounded. The fist which had paused because of Yun Yun\u2019s sharp cry earlier suddenly trembled. Immediately, it carried the last remaining strength within Xiao Yan and violently struck the spot of Yun Shan\u2019s chest where his heart was located in front of many shocked and joyful eyes!</p><br/><p>A bang sounded!</p><br/><p>A low, deep muffled sound appeared in the sky the moment the fist made contact, causing the hearts of a countless number of people to violently jump along with it.</p><br/><p>The fist was affixed to the chest in front of Yun Shan terrified eyes. Immediately, a powerful force surged out explosively like floodwaters!</p><br/><p>Crack! Crack!</p><br/><p>A deep sound appeared and a wave of bone-cracking sounds quickly appeared. This time around, it did not originate from Yun Shan\u2019s body but from the fist of the savage Xiao Yan, whose eyes revealed a craziness. Due to the strength of this blow being overly great, the reaction force had caused the bones on Xiao Yan\u2019s fist to reveal some crack lines!</p><br/><p>\u201cOld dog, this punch is for my father!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld dog, this punch is for my mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis punch is for those Xiao clan members who died!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis punch is because you have caused the lifespan of my second brother to shrink!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis punch is because you have caused my big brother to become a cripple!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan completely ignored the intense pain that was transmitted from his fist. His eyes were bloody right as his fist danced once again. Immediately, he viciously smashed it at Yun Shan like a lunatic. Furious roars sounded one after another each time his fist danced!</p><br/><p>\u201cGrug! Grug! Grug! Grug!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s chest was clearly dented a little inward after this crazy attack by Xiao Yan. A redness surged up onto his face and a large mouthful of fresh blood that contained some fragmented internal organs was wildly thrown up, dying Xiao Yan\u2019s body in front of him with fresh blood. However, Xiao Yan completely ignored it as his fist repeatedly and angrily smashed down. That crazy-like manner was filled with a coldness.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun\u2019s pretty face was completely void of any blood color as she looked at Yun Shan who was falling swiftly from the sky as well as that seemingly crazy Xiao Yan above him. Her knees became weak as she finally sat on the ground in a paralyzed manner. Her delicate hand covered the many painful swallowing sounds that her mouth emitted. She could tell just what kind of extent Xiao Yan\u2019s hatred had reached from the sharp and stern roar emitted from him.</p><br/><p>This kind of hatred could only be washed by using fresh blood!.</p><br/><p>The entire place was silent in the face of Xiao Yan\u2019s crazy attacks and the rapidly vanishing signs of life from the falling Yun Shan. Only Yun Yun\u2019s low forced saliva swallowing sound reverberated across the open ground.</p><br/><p>Hai Bodong, Jia Xing Tian, and the others all let out a long sigh of relief when they saw Xiao Yan\u2019s fist containing a fury as well as killing intent strike Yun Shan\u2019s body. They sat down on the treetop. The anxiety from earlier had nearly caused them to collapse.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little fellow\u2026 seems that he has suffered quite a bit during these two. This old dog Yun Shan could be said to be reaping what he has sown,\u201d Hai Bodong softly muttered after raising his head to look at Xiao Yan who was emitting a fury roar</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, it seems that the Misty Cloud Sect will have its name removed from the Jia Ma Empire\u2026\u201d.</p><br/><p>Jia Xing Tian nodded slightly. Although the Misty Cloud Sect was a large and strong in the past, they had become a chaotic faction of players who had greatly fallen.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Another heavy punch viciously smashed Yun Shan\u2019s already sunken chest. Xiao Yan\u2019s body swayed and the Jade Green Lotus Flame paled. His right fist was lowered and curled into a strange arc. That crazy attack earlier had resulted in the cracks on Xiao Yan\u2019s bones to spread. His fist bones quivered until it cracked apart significantly</p><br/><p>Yun Shan\u2019s face was covered with fresh blood. He slowly closed his eyes in fear and dissatisfaction. In his weakest state, the wild and crazy attack that he faced was something that would undoubtedly result in Yun Shan\u2019s death regardless of how crazily one attacked.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stared intently at Yun Shan whose aura was becoming increasingly weaker before it finally disappeared. This caused Xiao Yan\u2019s tightly clenched heart to relax. A wave-like tiredness surged onto his face, causing his eyes to miss something. A moment later, his lost all of its strength as it plummeted to the ground. Even someone like Yun Shan would need to avoid smashing into such a hard surface.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu! Xiu!\u201d</p><br/><p>A shadow flashed through the sky and pulled at Xiao Yan just as the latter was about to hit the ground.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s blurry sight swept the area in front of him. He looked at that familiar old face and smiled weakly. His voice was so soft that it could not be heard, \u201cTeacher\u2026 I have succeeded\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao softly sighed when he saw the weak smile on Xiao Yan\u2019s blood covered face. He pulled at Xiao Yan\u2019s slightly deformed wrist and said, \u201cYou are too crazy. You will likely need to recuperate for a long while because of these injuries\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was half-conscious as he heard Yao Lao\u2019s words. He suddenly recalled something and struggled to open his eyes. He looked at the falling corpse of Yun Shan that was about to strike the ground and hurriedly said, \u201cQuick. Capture that fellow\u2019s corpse. A skeleton of an elite Dou Zong\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao was initially startled when he heard this. His heart was immediately filled with warmth as he smiled and nodded. His body rushed toward Yun Shan\u2019s corpse in a lightning-like manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, Yao Chen, you are a little slow to act\u2026\u201d A black figure cut through the air like lightning and instantly appeared beside Yun Shan\u2019s body just as Yao Lao was about to move. The figure grabbed Yun Shan\u2019s body. It was actually that Protector Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are seeking death!\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s expression sank as he cried out sharply upon seeing the actions of Protector Wu</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, it is not certain just who is the one seeking death!\u201d Protector Wu laughed in a strange manner. The black fog on his hand flowed and it immediately slapped viciously on the top of Yun Shan\u2019s head. Finally, he pulled with his strength and an unconscious illusionary spiritual body was pulled out forcefully from Yun Shan\u2019s body by Protector Wu.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis protector said that I will capture and bring Yun Shan back to the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 today regardless of what kind of hefty price I have to pay!\u201d</p><br/><p>Protector Wu emitted a dark, cold laugh after forcefully pulling out Yun Shan\u2019s spirit in front of all the shocked gazes present. His hands immediately and abruptly changed into numerous strange and cumbersome hand seals. A moment later, a sharp cry suddenly resounded across the sky!</p><br/><p>\u201cNine Forest Swallowing Hundred Spirit!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sharp cry sounded and an unusual black fog suddenly surged out from within Protector Wu\u2019s body before wrapping the spiritual body of Yun Shan within it. Immediately, numerous chewing sounds were creepily and slowly emitted from the black fog.</p><br/><p>The expressions of everyone had become unusually ugly at this moment!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

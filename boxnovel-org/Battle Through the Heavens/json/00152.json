He was torn between laughing and crying as he said, \u201cWhy do I have the feeling that your words suggest something like rearing an animal at home, waiting for it to grow fat and then slaughtering it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, it shares the same principle.\u201d Yao Lao nodded as he smiled.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head and his gaze stared at the writhing small Purple Flame on his finger which was his only hope of evolving his Qi Methods. The Heavenly Flames were a little too distant for him while this Purple Flame from the Amethyst Essence was just suitable for his current condition and strength.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow do I refine it?\u201d Xiao Yan sighed, raised his head and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, this Purple Flame does not have an owner so it will not put up much resistance against you. Refining it into a Flame Seed should not involve too much danger.\u201d Yao Lao said as he extended his finger and placed it on Xiao Yan\u2019s head, \u201cFollow my instructions.\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling the large amount of information that was poured into his mind, Xiao Yan carefully savored it before nodding his head. He gradually closed his eyes and crossed his legs, adopting his training position. He observed his eyes, nose then heart as his mind gradually entered deep into his body.</p><br/><p>His mind circulated through his Qi Paths and finally arrived at the vortex in his lower abdomen. The appearance of the Dou Qi vortex was strangely much smaller than what it was before. However, if one carefully observed it, the vortex contains was much more dense and agglomerated better than before.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mind rotated around the vortex once. When he did not observe any problems, Xiao Yan followed Yao Lao\u2019s instructions and began to act.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mind went around the vortex and slowly entered it. At the same time, his Spiritual Perception repeatedly searched for the Purple Flame that he was controlling.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan carefully scanned the interior of the vortex. A long while later, numerous threads of extremely small purple colored energy began gradually appearing. When the purple colored energy appeared, Xiao Yan hurriedly controlled his Spiritual Perception and encompassed them in a lightning fast manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen a small hole in the vortex that can contain the Purple Flame\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Recalling Yao Lao\u2019s words in his mind, Xiao Yan swiftly surrounded the vortex with his Spiritual Perception. After a brief silence, his Spiritual Perception drove the vortex into spinning at a very fast speed.</p><br/><p>Following the vortex rotating at a fast speed, the Dou Qi that was flowing in his Qi Paths also surged quickly and ferociously. However, Xiao Yan did not have the leisure to bother about them; his mind was entirely focused on the small empty space at the middle of the vortex that was formed from the fast rotation.</p><br/><p>Seeing that his actions were effective, Xiao Yan increased the strength of his Spiritual Perception that was surrounding the vortex. Following the increase in strength of the spiritual awareness, the speed that the vortex was spinning at grew increasingly fast. In the end, the orbit of the pale yellow colored vortex could no longer be seen while the sound of a shapeless wind reverberated outside of the vortex. Xiao Yan\u2019s mind continued to observe the middle of the vortex where the empty space was growing wider. When it was approximately the size of a fist, Xiao Yan finally gave a relieved sigh and slowly withdrew his Spiritual Perception from the vortex.</p><br/><p>After the Spiritual Perception was entirely withdrawn, the rotation speed of the vortex also began to gradually become weaker. As for the hole in the middle of the vortex, it was able to form a strange equilibrium with its surroundings under the control of Xiao Yan\u2019s mind and did not disappear with the slower rotation speed of the vortex.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the empty space did not disappear, Xiao Yan let out another sigh in his heart. His mind slowly surrounded a thread of the purple colored energy and guided it through the blockade of the surrounding Dou Qi before inserting it into that small empty space.</p><br/><p>Immediately after the purple colored energy entered the empty hole, Xiao Yan felt the entire vortex shake and he hurriedly used his Spiritual Perception to stabilize the vortex.</p><br/><p>With Xiao Yan\u2019s Spiritual Perception putting in great effort to maintain the situation, the vortex finally became steady. From within the center hole of the vortex, Xiao Yan could see that numerous threads of fire type Dou Qi were continuously escaping from the vortex and pouring into the purple colored energy occupying the empty hole.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mind anxiously observed the small purple colored energy. As more and more fire type Dou Qi was poured into it, the purple colored energy let out a soft cry. A moment later, it began to transform under the observation of Xiao Yan\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>The color of the purple colored energy became darker. When it darkened to a certain stage, the purple colored energy suddenly trembled and a faint flame rose from the purple colored energy. Instantly, the purple colored energy was consumed by the tiny purple flame.</p><br/><p>In the dark empty hole, the purple colored flame flickered alone. Its faint warmth spewed and entered the Dou Qi vortex outside.</p><br/><p>When the faint heat entered the Dou Qi vortex, Xiao Yan could feel that the rotation of the vortex became much faster. Xiao Yan\u2019s initial reaction to this occurrence was shock and was instantly replaced by an uncontrolled joy. If the vortex could spin faster on its own, it meant that Xiao Yan did not need to manually control it. The Dou Qi from the surrounding environment would also automatically and continuously be poured into his body, allowing him to constantly be washed by Dou Qi. This kind of benefit was undoubtedly extremely useful for his training.</p><br/><p>After the purple colored flame appeared in the empty hole, it was as though it had started a huge circulating machine that was slowly beginning to spin.</p><br/><p>The purple colored flame needed to absorb the fire type Dou Qi from within the vortex in order to grow while the heat that it emitted, increased the Dou Qi absorption rate of the vortex. This ever repeating relationship significantly benefited both the Purple Flame and the vortex.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s mind observed the vortex once again. When he was certain that there were no problems, Xiao Yan finally withdrew his mind from within his body. He gradually opened his eyes and a purple light flashed across his pitch-black eyes. A moment later, his pair of eyes gradually recovered their original deep black color.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is it? Successful?\u201d Seeing that Xiao Yan opened his eyes, Yao Lao, who was waiting patiently, asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I\u2019ve refined it into a Flame Seed.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded his head and extended his palm. He rubbed his fingers gently. After a clear sound, a tiny purple colored flame rose from the tip of Xiao Yan\u2019s finger.</p><br/><p>With a gaze that was full of curiosity, Xiao Yan played with the purple fire that belonged to him. A moment later, his finger gently touched a mountain wall beside him. Instantly, the wall was charred.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis thing appears to be much weaker than Teacher\u2019s Bone Chilling Flame\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan bitterly smiled as he eyed the mark created by the flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. My Bone Chilling Flame is a Heavenly Flame and is ranked eleventh on the Heavenly Flames Ranking List. If this broken thing of yours can be compared with it, why would I have bothered taking the risk of being burnt into ashes to search for it?\u201d When he heard Xiao Yan\u2019s comment, Yao Lao immediately rolled his eyes and scolded him with a smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head. Those words of Yao Lao\u2019s were a significant blow to him. Something that he had luckily obtained after going through so much effort was described as a broken thing by Yao Lao.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, stop looking so downtrodden. This Purple Flame of yours has just been born, how much strength can it have? After your raise it, it should not be too weak. Didn\u2019t you see the strength of the Purple Flame attack by the Amethyst Winged Lion? Even that woman called Yun Zhi with her Dou Huang strength did not dare to simply block it. From this, it can be seen that this flame is not ordinary.\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s disappointed expression, Yao Lao comfortingly said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed and nodded. With a bitter smile, he said, \u201cIf I want to raise this little Purple Flame to the strength similar to that of the Amethyst Winged Lion, I\u2019m afraid it would take at least a few decades.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is true if we use normal reasoning.\u201d Yao Lao nodded. When he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s depressed expression, he helplessly said, \u201cBut don\u2019t you have the Amethyst Birth Essence? That thing is the best catalyst in raising the Purple Flame. As long as you can withstand the slight pain that it brings you, your Purple Flame should be able to grow at an extreme pace.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAmethyst Lion Birth Essence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yan was momentarily stunned. Unrestrained happiness quickly filled his face as he clumsily took out a small jade bottle from the storage ring. He opened the cap and a warm unusual fragrance was emitted from it.</p><br/><p>After taking in a deep breath of this scent that was filled with dense fire energy, Xiao Yan abruptly realised that the purple flame on his finger also became stronger under the scent.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a dense fire energy.\u201d Xiao Yan involuntarily gasped as he felt the Purple Flame\u2019s movement.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you train in the future, it will be best if you choose to do so under the hot sun. Additionally, you cannot consume too much of the Amethyst Lion Birth Essence. Of course, if you want to repeat the painful experience like the last time, you can ignore my words.\u201d Yao Lao jokingly said.</p><br/><p>Recalling the pain of his burning body the last time, Xiao Yan\u2019s body shuddered. That feeling was not something he wanted to experience a second time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWith your current strength, you should only use your finger to dip a little of it and swallow it into your body when you train. If you use too much you might end up burning yourself again.\u201d Yao Lao seriously reminded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhh.\u201d Xiao Yan quickly nodded his head. He did not dare make a joke out of this; it was more than enough to experience that kind of pain once.</p><br/><p>\u201cUsing the Amethyst Lion Birth Essence to speed up the growth of the Purple Flame\u2026 how long will it take before it can be swallowed?\u201d Xiao Yan tightly held the jade bottle in his hand, lifted his head and bitterly asked, \u201cA few years? If I had that kind of time, I might as well go and search for the Heavenly Flame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith the Amethyst Essence, you don\u2019t need so much time. On top of that, it is not necessary for the Purple Flame to reach the strength of that the Amethyst Winged Lion achieved. With your current strength, if you really groom the Purple Flame to that extent, you might end up being burnt to ashes by it. If you don\u2019t have sufficient strength, playing with fire will result in you being burnt.\u201d Yao Lao shook his head and voiced his thoughts, \u201cPerhaps, a month from now, you should be able to use \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 to try and swallow the Purple Flame.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA month?\u201d Xiao Yan licked his lips and softly mumbled. before quickly nodding his head seriously.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, a month from now, I\u2019ll swallow the Purple Flame and evolve my Flame Mantra!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

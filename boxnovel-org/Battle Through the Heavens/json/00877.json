This was because this lady was the \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019s\u2019 alchemist whom he had met earlier, Xin Lan.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xin Lan did not dare to make any unusual movements due to her neck being gripped by Xiao Yan. This was especially the case when she had sensed the genuine killing intent that filled his eyes. Her pretty face was mixed with a thread of moving paleness while her eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it you?\u201d Xiao Yan frowned slightly after identifying the lady. He questioned in a deep voice, \u201cYou were eavesdropping on us?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is actually you, little girl? What farce is this! This place is an important one in the Inner Academy, how can you just randomly budge in?\u201d Su Qian by the side reprimanded. His expression sank slightly after the shock from earlier dissipated.</p><br/><p>Xin Lan gently bit her lips in the face of Su Qian\u2019s reprimand. She said, \u201cGrandpa Su, Xin Lan has only barged in unintentionally.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs First Elder acquainted with her?\u201d Xiao Yan was involuntarily stunned when he heard the way Su Qian addressed Xin Lan. His gaze turned to Su Qian as he posed the question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, uh, this girl is the granddaughter of an old friend of mine. She was sent over to this place last year, and he asked me to take care and groom her.\u201d Su Qian smiled bitterly and nodded.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan only came to a sudden understanding when he heard this. He immediately released his hand, which had still been tightly wrapped around Xin Lan\u2019s neck, and said in a faint voice, \u201cSince you were able to eavesdrop for such a long time right in front of First Elder Su Qian\u2019s and my eyes, you should have likely consumed some medicinal pill that can hide your aura. You don\u2019t appear to have unintentionally intruded. Instead, you appear to have come prepared?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xin Lan\u2019s face involuntarily reddened slightly under the focus of Xiao Yan\u2019s dark-black eyes. She immediately clenched her silver teeth and said. \u201cI did indeed come and eavesdrop on purpose. Why are you so fierce? Moreover, I can tell you that if you plan to put your attention on the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame, you would only end up offending a powerful faction for no reason.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled as he asked in a deep voice. He had obtained a little information regarding the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 after much difficulty. How could he easily give it up?</p><br/><p>\u201cEarlier, I said that the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame has been passed on within the Burning Flame Valley for hundreds of years. The past experts over the generations have left behind a blood spiritual imprint within its essence that is difficult to remove. Unless you practice the key Qi Method of the Burning Flame Valley, \u2018Green Profound Serene Flame Skill,\u2019 you will definitely not be able to truly own it even if you managed to obtain the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame.\u201d Xin Lan held her snow-white long neck and let out successive coughs before explaining with a cold smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart immediately sank when he heard this. He frowned and asked, \u201cFirst Elder, is what she said true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s face was filled with uncertainty in the face of Xiao Yan\u2019s words. Immediately, he could only smile bitterly and shake his head. He said, \u201cI am not aware of this. However, if Xin Lan says that it is like this, then it should be true. Ugh, no wonder the Burning Flame Valley is able to preserve the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame. Their preparation method is so secretive. The old me has really underestimated them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart completely sank when he heard Su Qian speak. Was this clue that he had obtained with much difficulty completely useless?</p><br/><p>\u201cXin Lan comes from the Central Plains of the Dou Qi continent. The Burning Flame Valley is located in that area. Therefore, she has some understanding of them. Moreover, given her character, she should likely not be lying on purpose.\u201d Su Qian helped by revealing Xin Lan\u2019s background, like he was afraid that Xiao Yan would not believe what she said.</p><br/><p>\u201cCentral Plains?\u201d The foreign name caused Xiao Yan to be somewhat lost.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Central Plains is the name that is used to call the middle region of the Dou Qi continent. That region is extremely enormous with a countless number of intricate and complicated factions as well as strange ethnic groups one would have difficulty seeing. Therefore, it can be said that this is the central area of the Dou Qi continent. That place is the most exciting one in the Dou Qi continent\u2026 the peak experts of the continent mostly come from that area.\u201d Su Qian smiled and explained after seeming to understand Xiao Yan\u2019s lost look. \u201cMoreover, there, you might be able to obtain some information related to the background of your little female friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart, which had just sank, once again leaped suddenly upon hearing Su Qian\u2019s words. He let out a gentle breath as the displeased and joyful yet exquisite face of a young lady slowly surfaced in his mind. The warm smile that she wore on her face was just like the spring breeze that slowly caused Xiao Yan to calm down.</p><br/><p>After calming down, Xiao Yan engaged in deep thoughts for a moment before he abruptly turned to Xin Lan by his side. His eyes narrowed as he slowly said, \u201cYou should have something to say, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s heart carried some doubt toward Xin Lan since she had eavesdropped on the conversation between him and First Elder Su Qian without any reason. The former\u2019s character did not seem to be brainless. She should be aware that eavesdropping was a taboo. If she had not been spurred on by some reason, she definitely would not have done something like this.</p><br/><p>Xin Lan\u2019s expression was somewhat naturally turned red since she was being stared at by Xiao Yan. She was quiet for a moment before she clenched her silver teeth and said, \u201cDo you really wish to find some clues about a \u2018Heavenly Flame?\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can forget about the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame. The Burning Flame Valley has passed it down for centuries. They already possess a nearly perfect preservation method for it. Even if you are able to obtain it, you would not be able to use it\u2026\u201d Xin Lan hesitated for a moment after seeing Xiao Yan nod his head heavily before she slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have a method to resolve it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo\u2026\u201d Xin Lan shook her head as she looked at Xiao Yan\u2019s suddenly bright eyes. When she saw the latter frown, she could only curl her mouth and say, \u201cI do not have a method to allow you to resolve the issue, but I do know of a clue about another \u2018Heavenly Flame,\u2019 ranked even higher than the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame! Moreover, as long as you have the ability, your chances of obtaining it will not be less than snatching the Nine Dragon Lightning Flame.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan, who had just sat on his chair, suddenly straightened his body upon hearing this. His eyes were heated as he looked at Xin Lan. An excitement that was difficult to hide was present within his voice, \u201cAnother \u2018Heavenly Flame?\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>Xin Lan was also shocked when she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s excitement. She took a small step back before nodding slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell me. Regardless of what you want, I will give it to you as long as I have the ability to do it!\u201d Xiao Yan stepped forward and spoke in a heated voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not impossible for me to tell you. However, you must first tell me if you are currently a tier 6 alchemist?\u201d A nervousness surfaced within Xin Lan\u2019s eyes as she opened her mouth to ask. Only after seeing Xiao Yan nod his head did an unusual glint appear in her eyes. The back of her teeth bit her lower lip and her delicate hand tensed and relaxed for awhile. Only then did she inhale a deep breath and say, \u201cI will tell you the clue about the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 if you promise to help me with one thing!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak!\u201d Xiao Yan did not hesitate as he replied in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp my clan return to its Elder\u2019s Seat in the Pill Tower once again!\u201d Xin Lan\u2019s delicate hand suddenly tightened. A clear yet anxious voice suddenly sounded in the hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cPill Tower?\u201d Xiao Yan was slightly startled when he heard this name which was not considered too foreign. His brows immediately knit together. This special faction that was formed by alchemists possessed an extremely high position within the Dou Qi continent. Although he was not clear about the ranking within it, he could vaguely guess that the requirements to enter an Elder\u2019s Seat were extremely harsh. Hence, a momentary hesitation also surfaced within Xiao Yan\u2019s heart in front of this foreign great being.</p><br/><p>\u201cXin Lan, don\u2019t fool around. It is easier said than done in order to allow your clan to return to the Pill Tower once again. With Xiao Yan\u2019s current tier 6 alchemist strength, it would be impossible for him to help your clan enter the Elder\u2019s Seat once again. It is not as though you are not aware that the requirement there is extremely harsh. Unless one reaches the level of a tier 7 alchemist, the chances of success are extremely low!\u201d The expression of Su Qian by the side changed slightly upon hearing her request. He then replied to her in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know that the current him might still not be able to do it. However, his talent is definitely extremely great in order to reach the level of a tier 6 alchemist at such an age. Moreover, this talent is also rarely seen even in the Pill Tower. If he is willing to go all out and help, my clan would not be completely without any chance.\u201d Xin Lan was unmoved by Su Qian\u2019s cry. She still stubbornly looked at Xiao Yan and said, \u201cIf you are willing to help me, I shall give you a clue about the \u2018Heavenly Flame!\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gradually sank into a silence in the face of Xin Lan\u2019s nervous yet heated eyes. He had also adopted a certain respectful attitude toward that so-called Pill Tower. The abilities of this special faction were the most powerful he had seen with the exception of the \u2018Hall of Souls.\u2019 This kind of high end place would definitely possess an extremely intense competition. Although Xiao Yan had quite the confidence in his medicinal refining talent, that Pill Tower was a frightening place which gathered all the top alchemists in the Dou Qi continent. It was likely that the difficulty of making one\u2019s way in there was not any less than heading to the \u2018Hall of Soul\u2019 and coming back alive.</p><br/><p>The heat in Xin Lan\u2019s eyes was also slowly extinguished as though a cold water was poured over them when she saw Xiao Yan remain silent. She mocked herself. When she was about to turn around and leave, when Xiao Yan, who was silent for a moment longer, finally inhaled a deep breath of air and slowly said, \u201cI am unaware of how difficult it is to help your clan regain the Elder\u2019s Seat in the Pill Tower. Moreover, I also cannot guarantee that my help would allow you to achieve your aim. However, I can guarantee you that as long as you provide me with a useful clue about a \u2018Heavenly Flame,\u2019 I will do my best to go all out to help you! What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xin Lan\u2019s lovely body trembled when she heard Xiao Yan\u2019s words. An excited mist surged in the former\u2019s clear eyes. Regardless of whether this effort of hers bore fruit, she had at the very least brought a thread of hope in the face of her clan being extinguished. She hurriedly nodded her head.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled faintly. He forcefully suppressed the anxiety and excitement in his heart as he slowly said, \u201cSince that is the case\u2026 it should be your turn to inform me about the clue regarding a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 that you know. I will judge whether this clue is worth such a reward.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

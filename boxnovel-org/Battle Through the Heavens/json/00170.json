However, before he entered, a vicious force sent black colored powder spewing out from all directions from within the house.</p><br/><p>The sudden unforeseen event caused Xiao Yan to be slightly shocked. He cautiously took a few steps back with his right hand quickly holding on to the Heavy Xuan Ruler as he arched his body.</p><br/><p>Before the black colored powder could spew out from within the room, Ao Tuo rubbed his lips together and waved his sleeve fiercely. An even more vicious force appeared and lifted all the black powder, returning it all back from where it came from.</p><br/><p>As the black powder gradually scattered, it revealed a dirty and messy room behind it. Ao Tuo patted his hand, tilted his head and said cautiously to Xiao Yan, \u201cThis old man likes to do things like this to trick people. The black colored powder just now may not poison people, but if one\u2019s skin were to even come into the slightest contact with it, they would get a terrible itch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gradually releasing his palm from the Ruler\u2019s hilt, Xiao Yan bitterly smiled and shook his head. This old man was indeed abnormal.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Follow me. Don\u2019t touch anything.\u201d With a smile, Ao Tuo lead the way into the room with Xiao Yan closely following after a brief hesitation.</p><br/><p>After they entered the dark room, the door automatically slammed shut. The clear sound caused Xiao Yan to once again shake his head helplessly. His gaze swept across the room which was like a garbage dump as he followed Ao Tuo and climbed a few rotten wooden stairs that shook in a manner that suggested they were about to collapse. Finally, they arrived at the highest story after experiencing another few weird attacks.</p><br/><p>When they completed the climb, Xiao Yan let out a light breath. He raised his head and looked a wooden door at the end of the corridor. Tilting his head to Ao Tuo, he asked, \u201cIt should be here, shouldn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ao Tuo nodded his head. He then lowered it to observe his clothes. A few small holes had been formed from the corrosive liquid from the staircase. Twitching the corner of his mouth, he clenched his teeth together and said, \u201cThis old bastard. Instead of learning to refine proper medicine, he just likes to play with these things that are not fit to be seen by others\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the complaint, the corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth parted and laughed stuffily in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense about refining proper medicine, in what way are these things of mine not proper? You old rascal, don\u2019t think that just because you are the vice-chairman of the Alchemist Association, I will not dare to chase you out!\u201d While Xiao Yan was laughing stuffily, an old voice suddenly scolded from within the room at the end of the corridor.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the old rascal.\u201d Rolling his eyes, Ao Tuo resentfully waved his sleeves and led Xiao Yan into the corridor. Finally, they reached a spot outside the room. He then violently kicked the room\u2019s door which seemed to be made of wood.</p><br/><p>\u201cClang!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the kick made contact with the room\u2019s door, a clear metal sound suddenly sounded from the door. Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes twitched when he heard this and quickly turned his head to watch Ao Tuo\u2019s distorted old face. Tactfully, he quickly took a few steps back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, old man. After the last time you kicked down one of my doors, I replaced it with a steel one. Haha. Is it fun?\u201d From within the room, an old exploding laughter once again sounded in a gloating manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld bastard\u2026\u201d Ao Tuo\u2019s face was distorted as he inhaled a mouthful of cold air. The expression on his face slowly turned livid. From his body, an extremely fierce Dou Qi began to slowly rise and began to wrap around Ao Tuo like he was a person made of flames.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a strong Dou Qi\u2026 his strength is at least at the Dou Ling level.\u201d Seeing the writhing dark yellow Dou Qi on Ao Tuo\u2019s body, Xiao Yan hurriedly took two steps back as he sighed in his heart.</p><br/><p>With his body covered with Dou Qi, Ao Tuo once again violently kicked at the steel door.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d Following a deep muffled noise that sounded in the corridor, the door was sent flying into the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh! Old bastard, you really did it!\u201d Once the door flew into the room, a strange yell immediately came from the interior.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d Snorting with a vivid expression, Ao Tuo walked into the room with his legs lacking some coordination. His gaze swept the room, finally landing on an old man dressed in drab. He coldly smiled. \u201cGu Te, do you believe that I will put all the names of the things you hide here onto slips of paper and announce all of them to the outside world.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, don\u2019t don\u2019t\u2026 I was just joking.\u201d Hearing the threat, the old man in the gray drabs hurriedly waved his hand and smiled apologetically.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d Waving his sleeves, Ao Tuo turned around and faced outside the door. \u201cCome in, Xiao Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh, you brought someone along? What are you planning to do?\u201d Seeing Ao Tuo\u2019s manner, Gu Te\u2019s eyes widened as he said with a face filled with caution.</p><br/><p>Rubbing his lips, Ao Tuo was too lazy to bother about this crazy person.</p><br/><p>Slowly walking into the room, Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze habitually swept across the interior. When his sight glanced across a crystal counter in the room, an expression of amazement swiftly surfaced on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFire Heart Seven Leaf Flower? Blood Crystal Grass? Blue Heart Rock?...\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that all of these seldom seen, rare and precious things were actually all aggregated here, Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth could not help but slowly widen. The collection here was a little too rich, wasn\u2019t it?</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hey\u2026 boy, what are you looking at? Are you having any thoughts on my treasures?\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s expression, Gu Te hurriedly jumped over and stared at Xiao Yan angrily with a fierce expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Giving an embarrassed smile, Xiao Yan withdrew his gaze and his eyes stared at the old man in drab. It was difficult for him to imagine in his heart that this thin and weak looking old man would actually be the elder brother of Jia Ma Empire\u2019s well known Pill-King Gu He.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*, sorry. Grandmaster Gu Te, I have never seen so many strange and precious things in all my life. Looking at this lavish collection, I think that there is no one in the Jia Ma Empire that can be compared to you.\u201d Xiao Yan said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201c...Boy, you do know how to talk. However, what you said is quite true.\u201d Hearing these faintly sucking up words of Xiao Yan, the fierce expression on Gu Te\u2019s old face became a little gentler. He nodded his head and bluntly acknowledged those words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you here for. Hurry up and say, I\u2019m very busy.\u201d Turning around and sitting at a table that was piled up with broken things, Gu Te raised his legs as he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid has come here to find you for something.\u201d Ao Tuo rolled his eyes and glanced at the chair by the side which was filled with dust. He could only helplessly shake his head and remain standing as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? It\u2019s not like I know him. Why is he looking for me? Don\u2019t tell me that he has some strange treasure that he wishes to sell to me. Hehe, good good. As long as you can satisfy me, I will give you a satisfactory price!\u201d A glint appeared in Gu Te\u2019s eyes as he said with a smile while staring intently at the storage ring on Xiao Yan\u2019s finger.</p><br/><p>\u201c*Cough*... no, Grandmaster Gu Te, I\u2019m not here to sell my treasure, I\u2019m here to inquire about\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head as his eyes locked onto Gu Te\u2019s face. He softly asked, \u201cI want to inquire if you are keeping some \u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019 in your hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Gu Te was momentarily stilled. Next, he shook his head like a windmill. \u201cI don\u2019t have it, don\u2019t have it. You have found the wrong person. I don\u2019t have that thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Gu Te was acting childishly, Xiao Yan could only smile bitterly and shook his head. When he mentioned the \u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019 earlier, he had clearly noticed a surprised look flash across Gu Te\u2019s face. Perhaps, Gu Te was surprised about how Xiao Yan obtained the news that he had the \u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld man, stop lying. Didn\u2019t you tell me about it the last time? You managed to get for a small bottle of \u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019 from someone else. I still remember it clearly.\u201d Ao Tuo said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost. You old bastard. You better not come and find me here in the future.\u201d Having his lie exposed, Gu Te was instantly angry from being humiliated as he scolded.</p><br/><p>Ao Tuo waved his hand and said to Xiao Yan, \u201cI have already brought you to see him. How you get him to hand you the \u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019 is entirely up to you. I\u2019ll be waiting for you outside.\u201d Once he said those words, Ao Tuo headed out of the room. As he was about to exit, he lightly tapped his palm on a part of the wall. Immediately, a wooden door gradually rose from the doorway and covered the interior of the room after he walked out.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Ao Tuo had left, Xiao Yan helplessly nodded. He waved his hand and blew away the dust on the chair before sitting opposite Gu Te.</p><br/><p>Gu Te\u2019s old eyes glanced at the tightly shut door before taking a look at Xiao Yan. He snorted: \u201cBoy, forget it. I will never hand the \u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019 to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster Gu Te, I believe there isn\u2019t any transaction in this world that cannot be completed. If a transaction is unsuccessful, it simply means that one has not taken out something that the other party is interested in exchanging something for.\u201d Xiao Yan said with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Since you know this, then why are you still here? Don\u2019t tell me that you need the \u2018Ice Spirit Cold Fountain\u2019 to save lives or whatever. I don\u2019t possess those pointless feelings of sympathy.\u201d Raising his dark black eyebrows, Gu Te glanced at Xiao Yan. His smile had a teasing feel. It appeared that he did not think that Xiao Yan could take out something that he would be interested in.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s palm slowly rubbed his chin as his mouth was closed tightly; he looked like he was considering what kind of thing could move Gu Te in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, boy do you really possess something? But I will say this upfront. Don\u2019t take out Qi Methods or Dou Techniques. Although they are very precious, I\u2019m not interested in them. What I like the most\u2026 are rare ingredients.\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s manner, Gu Te was also a little interested. His finger pointed at the many rare ingredients in the room laughing as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s finger lightly tapped on the table. He was silent for a long while before his finger gently rubbed the storage ring. After flicking his finger, a small jade bottle appeared in his palm.</p><br/><p>Seeing the emerald jade bottle in Xiao Yan\u2019s hand, Gu Te raised his eyebrows. A faint curiosity surfaced in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan rubbed the small bottle, unwilling to part with it. He then slowly opened the cap of the bottle and gently placed it on the table. Immediately, a purple vapor rose from within. At that moment, the temperature of the small room also seemed to rise significantly.</p><br/><p>Gu Te\u2019s eyes slightly shrank as he felt the surrounding air becoming hotter and stared at the threads of purple flame vapor in the room.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

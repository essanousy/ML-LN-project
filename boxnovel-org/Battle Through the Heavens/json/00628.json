He immediately opened his eyes, and his gaze was filled with disbelief as he stared at the tall straight-backed black figure in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother?\u201d Xiao Li\u2019s gaze trembled as he stared at the somewhat familiar back. His face, which did not change even a little when facing death, was at this moment filled with stunned disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan? You have not died? How is that possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>Fan Lao turned his gaze over the instant that Xiao Yan appeared. The expression on his face immediately became still when his gaze swept over the familiar young face. Shock and fear surfaced together. At the end, a voice that had become sharp due to fear was emitted from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan? He is that Xiao Yan who defeated Fan Lao and nearly killed Medicine Emperor Han Feng?\u201d</p><br/><p>The three expert Dou Wangs at the side did not have any specially great reaction to Xiao Yan\u2019s appearance. However, when Fan Lao\u2019s sharp voice involuntarily cried out the name that reverberated like thunder in the ears of everyone within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019, shock instantly swarmed up their faces as they muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you very disappointed that I have not died?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s figure slowly descended from the sky before appearing in front of Xiao Li. He laughed coldly toward Fan Lao before immediately turning his head to look at Xiao Li, whose face was still filled with disbelief. He smiled and spoke gently, \u201cSecond brother, do you not recognize me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 are you really Xiao Yan?\u201d Xiao Li widened his mouth. He extended his hand in an attempt to touch Xiao Yan\u2019s body, but he seemed to be afraid of something and ultimately did not dare to actually touch him. He seemed to be afraid that this was an illusion before his death.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and extended his arm to hold Xiao Li\u2019s white hand. He laughed softly, \u201cSecond brother, it\u2019s me. How can I easily die when the Xiao clan has such a great vengeance that needs to be repaid?\u201d</p><br/><p>A redness gradually swarmed onto Xiao Li\u2019s originally white face as he sensed the temperature that was transmitted from Xiao Yan\u2019s hands. His eyes trembled as he stared at Xiao Yan. The strength of his hand which was holding onto Xiao Yan\u2019s arm increased. Those eyes of his had even become red at this moment. Xiao Li had revealed this moving scene despite his cold and indifferent character. One could just imagine just how excited his heart was.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, second brother, I will catch up with you properly after finishing off this old dog.\u201d Xiao Yan patted Xiao Li\u2019s hand and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t. That fellow is an elite Dou Huang.\u201d Xiao Li\u2019s expression changed slightly when he heard this. A glint flickered in his eyes as he said, \u201cThey are superior in numbers. I think that we should withdraw first. There\u2019s a lot more time in the future with many opportunities to take revenge. Nothing wrong must happen to you now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Xiao Li had long carried the will to die. If it was him alone, he would naturally not think of fleeing. However, things were different now. Xiao Yan\u2019s appearance had caused his gloomy heart, which had been shrouded by the aura of death, to be filled with the will to live. Therefore, he overturned his earlier normal behavior, and the thought of fleeing emerged from within his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, second brother, you can rest assured. I was able to cause him to flee while being at death\u2019s door two years ago. Today, I will be able to do the same.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. He flipped his hand, and he strangely escaped from Xiao Li\u2019s hand like a swimming fish. He smiled at the latter and his gentle voice was filled with a confidence that caused others to feel calm, \u201cBelieve me, second brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen\u2026 be careful. I will help you block the remaining three Dou Wangs.\u201d Xiao Li was startled when he saw the confidence in Xiao Yan\u2019s smile. He immediately clenched his teeth and stood up. The black-colored long spear in his hand was slammed heavily on the ground. A powerful aura spread out from it.</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave all of them to me. You are currently quite badly injured.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head. He did not wait for Xiao Li\u2019s protest before turning around. The smile on his face slowly turned dark and cold.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan flipped his hand and the large Heavy Xuan Ruler flashed out from a low grade Storage Ring First Elder Su Qian had given him. He carelessly waved the heavy ruler, and a wave of low, deep explosive sounds formed below it. Finally they completely shattered the rocks on the ground.</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Leader Fan. I will take this old life of yours today!\u201d Xiao Yan pointed the heavy ruler toward Fan Lao opposite of him. There was a laughter in his voice, but it was filled with an incomparable killing intent.</p><br/><p>If Xiao Yan had arrived a moment later when this old dog unleashed a killing move on Xiao Li, it was likely that he would only be able to see Xiao Li\u2019s body. This fear in addition to their earlier conflict had caused Xiao Yan\u2019s heart to be filled with a surging killing intent. The name Fan Lao had been crossed with a blood-colored line on his must kill list.</p><br/><p>Fan Lao\u2019s face was volatile as he stared at the black-robed young man on the opposite side with a killing intent that spread throughout the sky. The disbelief in his heart was gradually withdrawn under this reality. It was replaced with a kind of unusual fear and fury. Back then, he was defeated by Xiao Yan\u2019s hands. This had caused him to be ridiculed by quite a number of people in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 during these two years. This also caused the reputation of the \u2018Blood Sect\u2019 to fall greatly. All of this was caused by this fellow in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo of you should go and capture that injured fellow. Remember, you cannot kill him. As long as he is captured, Xiao Yan can only surrender\u2026 the remaining person should delay Xiao Yan with me. The reward if you can take his life will definitely make you extremely happy. Don\u2019t all of you want a \u2018Dou Spirit Pill\u2019? As long as you can kill Xiao Yan this time around, your wish will definitely be granted!\u201d Fan Lao turned his head and spoke in a dark voice to the other three Dou Wangs.</p><br/><p>Fan Lao had a phobia from being defeated in Xiao Yan\u2019s hands back then. Therefore, it was unavoidable that he would feel uncertainty in his heart if he were to fight with Xiao Yan. This caused him to ignore his status and ask someone to help him defeat his opponent.</p><br/><p>A hot fieriness immediately flashed across the eyes of the three expert Dou Wangs when they heard Fan Lao\u2019s words. \u2018Dou Spirit Pill\u2019. This was a medicinal pill that they had coveted for a long time. However, they needed to commit an extremely great contribution to the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 in order to obtain it. Although they had been acting as fighters for the \u2018Black Alliance\u2019 these few years, there was still quite a big gap to the needed contribution points to exchange for it.</p><br/><p>The three Dou Wangs merely hesitated for a moment in their hearts under the strong allure of the \u2018Dou Spirit Pill\u2019 before the hesitation was defeated in the face of the allure. They exchanged looks with one another before fiercely nodded their heads.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze was densely cold as he watched the four people on the opposite side. A faint dark-green Dou Qi surged out from his body like a substance-like flame. It withered repeatedly on the surface as a powerful aura covered half of the stockade.</p><br/><p>Fan Lao\u2019s expression changed slightly just as Xiao Yan\u2019s surging aura was about to attack. He appeared to have sensed something and lifted his head. His expression immediately became much uglier when his gaze swept over the red-dressed bewitching beauty that had unknowingly appeared in the sky. What did this woman want to do by appearing at this moment.</p><br/><p>The person who had suddenly appeared was naturally Queen Medusa who had been following Xiao Yan. This queen, whom he had forcefully possessed, had a pair of alluring eyes that were still filled with coldness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time around, who will be here to help you?\u201d Queen Medusa\u2019s body was suspended in the air. Her cold and indifferent voice slowly reverberated through the sky.</p><br/><p>The unwelcomed guest who had appeared also caused Fan Lao and the others to be startled. The aura of Queen Medusa caused them to feel an uneasiness. However, a wild joy immediately filled their faces when they discovered that this mysterious strong person was against Xiao Yan. If she and Xiao Yan were to fight, they would be able to easily capture Xiao Li. At that time, Xiao Yan would naturally not dare to attack for fear of harming Xiao Li.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, this friend. Is your target Xiao Yan? If that is the case, we can cooperate. This fellow is extremely crafty. Just you alone might not be sufficient.\u201d Fan Lao gave Xiao Yan a sinister smile before immediately speaking with a smile to Queen Medusa in the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have the qualification.\u201d</p><br/><p>Queen Medusa glanced indifferently at Fan Lao in the sky and spoke in a manner that did not give the latter any face. This also caused Fan Lao\u2019s expression to become much uglier. Originally, he had thought that it would be the best of both worlds if they cooperated since they had similar intentions. However, it was unexpected that Medusa did not appreciate his offer.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are not willing then please do as you please.\u201d Fan Lao laughed dryly as he slowly lowered his head. A viciousness and obscenity flashed across his eyes. \u201cDamn woman. I will definitely look for an opportunity to capture you after everything is settled, and get you to beg for mercy under my body!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, who is she? She seems to be after you.\u201d Xiao Li\u2019s face had also become somewhat ugly at this moment. The situation was originally disadvantageous to them. It was unexpected that another mysterious woman of unknown background had suddenly appeared. Moreover, it appeared that her strength was quite great.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face sank. His gaze was like chilly ice as he stared at Queen Medusa in the sky. This gaze which did not carry the slightest emotion actually caused Medusa, who had always killed for fun, to feel an uneasy feeling. She turned her gaze aside.</p><br/><p>However, she had just turned her gaze aside when Queen Medusa suddenly sensed it. With her haughtiness, how could she withdraw under Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze?</p><br/><p>\u201cMedusa, we can settle the matter between us in the future. If you intervene today, I, Xiao Yan will force you to die here even if I risk my life to do so. If you don\u2019t believe me\u2026 you can come and try!\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze was dark and cold. His face had a slight wildness to it. He was similarly clearly aware that if Queen Medusa were to stop him at this moment, Xiao Li would end up in the hands of Fan Lao and the others. That kind of situation\u2026 was sufficient to really cause him to become crazy.</p><br/><p>Queen Medusa\u2019s eyebrows slowly became vertical amid Xiao Yan\u2019s words which contained a chillness. No one had dared to threatened her in all her life. Yet, these words of Xiao Yan now\u2026</p><br/><p>A cold glint flickered in Queen Medusa\u2019s long beautiful eyes. A moment later, those eyes suddenly turned toward Xiao Yan\u2019s face which contained traces of craziness when a killing intent was rising within her heart. She was immediately startled. An unknown emotion quietly spread out from somewhere deep within her spirit, and slowly suppressed the killing intent in her heart.</p><br/><p>Queen Medusa knit her brows slightly as she sensed the gradually reducing killing intent within her heart. An unknown frustration quietly rose within her heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, remember. Your life is mine! I will take it away sooner or later!\u201d</p><br/><p>Queen Medusa suppressed the unusual frustration within her heart. She violently swung her sleeves and let out a cold laugh. Immediately, her graceful figure quietly disappeared amid the stunned gazes of Fan Lao and the others.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was also startled for a while when he saw that Queen Medusa had really did as she was told and left. This woman who was renowned for her ferocity was actually really bothered about his threat? He had originally already made plans to really go all out\u2026</p><br/><p>Of course, if Xiao Yan really dared to speak these words in front of Queen Medusa, she would definitely be infuriated given her usual character. However, the current Queen Medusa had already firmly possessed this body of hers and had merged her spirit with that of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019. This kind of merger may have allowed Queen Medusa to gain the leading role but her emotions would be somewhat mixed with that of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 to a certain extent. Queen Medusa was filled with killing intent toward Xiao Yan, but the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 was extremely attached to Xiao Yan. The mixture of these two was the cause of the current complicated emotions that Queen Medusa had for Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>While being filled with killing intent, she had difficulty really performing the killing move. This conflicting emotion was the source of the frustration within Queen Medusa\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Nevertheless, Queen Medusa at least retreated after being shouted at by Xiao Yan. Next, he, without any burdens, would be able to calmly settle the old and new grudges with Fan Lao!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

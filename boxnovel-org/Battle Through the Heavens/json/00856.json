Even the Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan were among the people already there.</p><br/><p>Su Qian quietly sat in the hall. He involuntarily smiled when he saw Xiao Yan and Xiao Li entering. A female servant with sharp eyes and quick hands respectfully placed two empty chairs in the leader\u2019s position.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and Xiao Li slowly walked into the hall and unceremoniously sat in those chairs. Only then did they smile. One asked Su Qian, \u201cFirst Elder, is there news of Old Ying Shan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian nodded slightly and slowly replied, \u201cAccording to the information that was received earlier, it seemed that Old Ying Shan has already left the city. However, there is something strange. This old fellow did not do anything to hide his trace. Instead, he walked out of the eastern gate where the greatest number of people are. Currently, it is likely that quite a number of factions within the Black Emperor City have already received this information.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily frowned when he heard this. What was this Old Ying Shan planning to do? He was actually acting with such a high profile in the face of such a situation where everyone was looking at him with ill intent. Even though he was an elite Dou Zong, it was likely that it would be troublesome dealing with those many greedy people who would come in a wave-like manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that it is a bait and not his true self?\u201d Xiao Li frowned and questioned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere was no lack of experts among those people observing. However, if they could see Old Ying Shan\u2019s figure from far away, they would feel shocked. If it is a subsitute, it is impossible for Old Ying Shan to go and find another elite Dou Zong, right? If that is the case, he would be able to ignore everything and just leave. With two Dou Zongs, there would hardly be anyone in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 who would dare stop them.\u201d Su Qian shook his head and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that he really intends to deal with the many \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 factions and experts who are watching him with malicious intent?\u201d Xiao Yan tightly knit his brows as he wondered out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cGiven this old fellow\u2019s rampant, fierce, brutal character back then, we cannot eliminate this thinking.\u201d Su Qian hesitated for a moment before repling to Xiao Yan\u2019s random words.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan involuntarily rolled his eyes when he heard this. If this was really the case, would he not appear a little too arrogant? Given his eyesight, Old Ying Shan would naturally be aware that he was not the only elite Dou Zong in the auction ground who had an interest in the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. If it was just ordinary people, he could rely on his strength and view them without any fear. However, it would be impossible for him to ignore these experts who were of the same class as him, right?</p><br/><p>\u201cHas that Demon Flame Valley had any activity?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s finger gently tapped the table before he suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are also aware of the news of Old Ying Shan leaving the city. Currently, they are following a short distance behind him. From the looks of it, they don\u2019t appear on to be planning an immediate attack.\u201d Su Qian replied.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan faintly nodded. He mused for a moment before slowly standing up. He said in a deep voice, \u201cIn that case, we should also move. It is of no help to make random guesses in this place. Instead, we should follow behind Old Ying Shan and see just what he is planning to do. From how I see it, he would definitely not hand something as precious as the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva to someone else to take away given his cautious character. After all, he is quite confident in his strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>No one rejected Xiao Yan\u2019s suggestion. Immediately, the people from \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 and Jia Nan Academy began to pack everything under Xiao Li\u2019s and First Elder Su Qian\u2019s orders. After which, they quietly left this compound from the back. They swiftly exited the Black Emperor City and followed the path which Old Ying Shan had taken, attempting to catch up with him.</p><br/><p>Not long after Xiao Yan\u2019s group left the Black Emperor City, news of their departure was swiftly transmitted to the Black Emperor Sect.</p><br/><p>Mo Tian Xing\u2019s expression was indifferent as he listened to the report of the spy within the Black Emperor Sect\u2019s Meeting Room. A moment later, he nodded and waved his hand to dismiss the spy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is unexpected that this Yan Xiao has actually gotten together with \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019s\u2019 group\u2026 this is somewhat troublesome. Won\u2019t their side have two elite Dou Zong?\u201d Qi Shan watched the spy withdraw from behind Mo Tian Xing. He frowned and asked a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Yan Xiao and them are not old acquaintances, it might be likely that the people from \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 gave him the ruler technique Dou Technique. The one they had bought in the auction. It would facilitate cooperation between both parties\u2026\u201d Mo Tian Xing slightly nodded. His expression was somewhat ugly. Originally, he had thought that Xiao Yan and \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 had formed a grudge after the matters at the auction. It was unexpected that they ended up working together\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do now? Currently, their strength is even greater after joining hands. We can forget about obtaining that Zong Breaking Pill.\u201d Mo Ya by his side could not help but anxiously speak after hearing this. The Zong Breaking Pill was something that even Qi Shan could not refine. If he could not obtain the pill in Xiao Yan\u2019s hands, he would not know just when it would be before he gained the chance to obtain another.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you so anxious for? Currently, they are working together. Don\u2019t tell me that you can go over and break them apart? Two Dou Zongs. Even I would not dare to act. Now, you will quietly wait here. They are clearly targeting Old Ying Shan. However, this old fellow is also not an ordinary person. It will not be an easy matter to obtain the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva from him.\u201d Mo Tian Xing\u2019s expression sank as he reprimanded.</p><br/><p>Mo Ya could only swallow the resentment he felt after being reprimanded by Mo Tian Xing. He felt bitter, but did not dare to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cSect leader, there seems to be something wrong with Old Ying Shan. Given his cautious character, it is impossible for him to leave the city in such a flagrant manner. He should also know that there are many experts waiting for him outside of the city.\u201d Qi Shan frowned as he hesitatingly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old fellow is also cautious and crafty. It is naturally impossible for him to do such a thing.\u201d Mo Tian Xing\u2019s face revealed a strange smile as he softly replied.</p><br/><p>Qi Shan and Mo Ya by the side involuntarily exchanged covert gazes with one another when they saw that strange smile on Mo Tian Xing\u2019s face. However, while they wanted to wait for Mo Tian Xing to continue speaking, the latter shut his mouth. Qi Shan could not help but carefully asked, \u201cDoes sect leader know what that old fellow is planning?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will naturally know when the time come. This Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva is not something that our Black Emperor Sect is willing to simply take out\u2026\u201d Mo Tian Xing waved his hand. His eyes revealed a denseness as he coldly laughed, \u201cNow, we will just watch these factions get entangled in a bloody battle with Old Ying Shan. The more people die the better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qi Shan and Mo Ya looked at each other after hearing this. They immediately laughed and agreed.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, if our Black Emperor Sect had not failed to obtain even a little information about the Bodhisattva Heart from this Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva despite studying it for such a long time, we would definitely not have taken this thing out to auction.\u201d Mo Tian Xing knit his brows as his eyes swept to a distant area outside of the Black Emperor City.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, regardless of whether we are able to study and find something, it is always best if the thing is in our hands\u2026 other people can forget about obtaining the thing that our Black Emperor Sect fails to obtain!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s group looked down at the main road within the woods from a small hill. A gray-haired old man at one side of the road appeared as though he did not sense the strange atmosphere as he slowly walked as he pleased. Human figures were leaping and rushing from behind him as numerous fiery hot gazes penetrated the cover of the forest. They stared intently at the back of the old man in front.</p><br/><p>Although the greed in their hearts was burning their rational thoughts, no one dares to make the slightest unusual movement in front of the frightening strength of Old Ying Shan. They merely continued to follow. However, this state of tracking would instantly be broken with the increase in one\u2019s greed. The allure of the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva was too difficult for everyone to resist.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis old fellow is actually not the least bit anxious? By traveling at such a tepid pace, is he not trying to cause more and more people to be attracted over?\u201d Xiao Yan stared at the old back in the forest from the hill as he frowned and questioned.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li and Su Qian knit their brows as they stood by Xiao Yan\u2019s side. The actions of Old Ying Shan caused them to feel quite uncertain. Based on common sense, anyone who had obtained such a rare treasure would naturally use the fastest speed to leave this dangerous place. In the end, this old fellow\u2026 Displayed this strange scene? Did he really intend to rely on his own strength to contend with the many experts from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe number of auras that have appeared in this forest are increasing. There are quite a number of people among them who are quite skilled. Should someone end up taking the lead to attack, it would likely end up affecting the entire situation, sparking this chaotic situation. At that time, Old Ying Shan would have some trouble.\u201d Su Qian slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan vaguely nodded. His gaze swept over the forest and suddenly asked, \u201cWhere are the people from the Demon Flame Valley?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey should also be keeping their eyes on Old Ying Shan. However, quite a number of powerful experts have been sent from the Demon Flame Valley this time around. It is extremely difficult to discover them if they hid in this mountain forest.\u201d Su Qian whispered.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan inclined his chin. His gaze swept over the road in the forest. Finally, he stared intently at Old Ying Shan\u2019s back. For some unknown reason, he felt a persistent feeling that something was not quite right. Everyone kept saying that this old fellow was crafty. Yet, he was currently moving in this manner. This did not match his description\u2026</p><br/><p>A commotion suddenly occurred within the crowd that was following behind Old Ying Shan while this thought flashed through Xiao Yan\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slid his eyes over when he sensed the commotion. His eyes immediately solidified as he softly asked, \u201cAre they about to strike?\u201d</p><br/><p>The mountain forest that was covered by a layer of strange atmosphere suddenly froze. The source of this solidification was ten shadowy-faced human figures among the large group of people following behind.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

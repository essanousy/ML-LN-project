A long while later, he flipped his hand and a transparent bottle appeared in his palm. A bottle full of Amethyst Essence was contained within the bottle.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan opened the bottle cap and extended his finger into it. As he carefully dipped a little of it, a stinging pain was immediately transmitted from his finger.</p><br/><p>After withdrawing his hand, Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes stared intently at the drop of Amethyst Essence on the tip of his finger. The Dou Qi in his body flowed, seeped through his finger and gently touched the drop of purple colored Amethyst Essence. Immediately, a soft muffled \u2018bang\u2019 sounded. A thread of tiny purple colored flame rose from his finger. The hot temperature caused Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes to narrow.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe temperature is not bad\u2026 but unfortunately, the purple flame that a drop of Amethyst Essence can create is really too little.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded his head before he immediately said somewhat regretfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have much Amethyst Essence stored. If a drop of it can only create this small bit of a Purple Flame, my losses would be far greater than my gain.\u201d Xiao Yan stared at the bottle of Amethyst Essence and said with his eyebrows knit together.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this little fellow also did not absorb much of it. How did it spit out fire like a flamethrower?\u201d Xiao Yan slowly tilted his head and eyed the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 who was enjoying itself greatly spitting out flames as he asked himself with uncertainty in his voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze was intently staring at the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019. A long while later, he gently lifted his eyebrow. After some observation, he realized that at the moment when the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 was about to spit out the Purple Flame, some saliva seemed to seep out between its fangs in its mouth. When the tiny purple colored flame seedlings came into contact with this saliva, its size suddenly expanded by over ten times.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it because of the saliva?\u201d Xiao Yan muttered softly in his mouth. He smiled slightly and as he flipped his palm, an empty bottle appeared in it. Immediately, he walked slowly over to the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 with a smile on his lips.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After a frustrating toss and turn that caused him to be covered in perspiration, Xiao Yan finally obtained slightly less than half a bottle of pale green colored saliva from the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019s\u2019 fangs under its resentful gaze. He placed it under his nose and sniffed the saliva which had a faint fragrance. Xiao Yan\u2019s face was strange as he shook his head. Glancing at the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 on the bed, Xiao Yan muttered in his heart, \u201cThis fellow, Don\u2019t tell me it is also a female?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently set the two bottles in his hand down as he mused for a moment. Suddenly, he beckoned with his palm and pulled out a dark red colored cauldron from his storage ring, which he then placed on the table. His finger flicked gently. A few wisps of a green colored flame shot out and a hot flame immediately rose within the medicinal cauldron.</p><br/><p>Watching the writhing flame within the medicinal cauldron, Xiao Yan gently rubbed his storage ring and obtained a few completely red plants which with one glance, one would be able to tell that they contained fire type energy. Waving his palm, he threw them all into the medicinal cauldron. He then controlled the green colored flame and repeatedly refined them, turning them into a large pile of red colored powder.</p><br/><p>Once the red colored powder appeared, Xiao Yan used two needle tubes that had hollow centers to suck a drop of Amethyst Essence and the saliva of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 respectively. After which, he cast them into the medicinal cauldron.</p><br/><p>Eyeing the flame that was soaring within the medicinal cauldron, Xiao Yan smiled slightly. His ten fingers nimbly leaped about and the temperature of the green colored flame repeatedly rose and fell, changing with his thoughts. Although this kind of swift changing of the flame temperature was extremely testing on the flame controlling ability of an alchemist, the current Xiao Yan after he consumed the \u2018Fire Lotus Seed\u2019 already possessed the ability to easily overcome these kinds of troublesome steps.</p><br/><p>Within the medicinal cauldron, the green colored flame danced enchantingly. A long while later, the hot temperature gradually faded away. The turbulent flame also slowly disappeared. Finally it passed through the flame outlet, turned into a tiny wisp of flame and entered into Xiao Yan\u2019s finger.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough a large amount of it was depleted during the refining of medicine, being able to retrieve a little is somewhat nice.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled as he eyed the wisp of green colored flame that had entered his body. He flicked his finger and a gentle breeze shot down the cover of the cauldron. He then beckoned with his hand and three red colored pills flew out before steadily landing in Xiao Yan\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan played with these three Danwan and a smile involuntarily surfaced on the corner of his mouth. This kind of Danwan could not be called a medicinal pill. This was because they did not possess any unique properties like a medicinal pill. Anyone who swallowed this thing into their stomach would not only not receive the slightest benefit, but instead sink into a miserable state.</p><br/><p>(L: Danwan is like a pill but it does not help any human who consumes it</p><br/><p>After twisting a red colored Danwan between his fingers, Xiao Yan threw it into his mouth. He chewed it slightly and waited until he sensed the hot energy swiftly spreading in his mouth. At that moment, the Dou Qi in his body quickly swarmed up and collided with the hot energy.</p><br/><p>At the moment of collision, Xiao Yan opened his mouth slightly. A cluster of hot purple colored flame was suddenly spit out. After which, it steadily landed on his palm that was wrapped with Dou Qi. It burnt with a rage and still had considerable might.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently breathed out a mouthful of hot air before lowering his head to eye the purple colored flame rising in his palm. The amount of Purple Flame this time around was about enough needed to merge with the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019. At that moment, Xiao Yan heaved a sigh of relief. A drop of Amethyst Essence, a drop of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019s\u2019 saliva and some fire type medicinal ingredients. The ability of these few things to achieve such an effect had satisfied Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s call this thing \u2018Purple Flame Pill\u2019...\u201d Tossing the two red colored Danwan in his hand, Xiao Yan opened his mouth and laughed. The current him really wanted to try and see just how great the strength of the \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 created from the merger of the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 and the Purple Flame would be.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I need to find a flesh target\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A smile surfaced on Xiao Yan\u2019s face as he eyed the \u2018Purple Flame Pill\u2019. He turned around and placed the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019 which had fallen asleep after becoming tired from spitting out flames. After which, he smiled and walked out of this shaking room, which appeared about to fall, to find a live target to test just how strong this imitated version of the \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 was\u2026</p><br/><p>Currently, it was the time of daily training at the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019 training ground. Therefore, many mercenaries were gathered on the training ground. They withstood the hot sun and were covered in perspiration as they sparred and compared their skills. On a shaded area on the open ground stood Xiao Ding and a few others. Their gaze occasionally swept across the training ground and nodded slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Luo Bu, looks like the brothers from the \u2018Sand Mercenary Company\u2019 are getting along quite well with the others. You have worked hard during this period of time.\u201d Xiao Ding turned his head around and said with a smile to Luo Bu beside him as he eyed the mercenaries from both troops whose entanglement had clearly been significantly eliminated because of this period of adapting with one another.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are all methods that Compay Leader Xiao Ding thought off. I have only executed them out.\u201d Luo Bu shook his head, the corner of his eye carried great respect as he glanced at Hai Bo Dong by the side. On one occasion, he had seen this old man fight. Therefore, he clearly knew just what kind of strength this inconspicuous old man had. Luo Bu\u2019s heart also became a little more afraid of Xiao Yan who was able to invite Hai Bo Dong to live in this Mercenary Company . When he noticed Xiao Ding ask this question, he hurriedly gave a polite reply.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ding naturally knew the fear in Luo Bu. Immediately, he smiled and conversed a little with him before he turned around and glanced at Hai Bo Dong who was leaning against a tree trunk and pulling a long face. He said with a smile, \u201cKe ke, Old Mister Hai, does the medicinal shop not have the medicinal ingredients that you need? Relax, I have already sent people to help you search in the neighbouring cities. If they obtain any news, they will report back very soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least you, little fellow, have put in some effort. That guy Xiao Yan has withdrawn into that courtyard ever since he told me about these medicinal ingredients and has not come out again.\u201d Hearing this, a weak smile appeared on Hai Bo Dong face as he replied to Xiao Ding.</p><br/><p>\u201cBadmouthing people behind their backs is not a good thing\u2026\u201d A faint laugh was suddenly emitted from behind everyone. The familiar voice caused the few people to hurriedly turn their heads around and eye the smiling Xiao Yan who was walking over.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs your injury completely healed?\u201d Eyeing Xiao Yan, whose presence clearly had greater vitality compared to the past, surprise flashed across Hai Bo Dong\u2019s old face as he asked in a stunned voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and nodded his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, what an abnormal person. Making a complete recovery in less than a month with that kind of serious injury\u2026\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan nodding his head, Hai Bo Dong immediately smiled bitterly and shook his head. At the same time, his heart was shocked by the means Xiao Yan had displayed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. He smiled and conversed with Xiao Ding and the others for a while before his gaze suddenly drifted to Luo Bu by the side. He smiled slightly, but the smile caused the latter to feel somewhat scared.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompany Leader Xiao Yan.\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan slowly walking over, Luo Bu hurriedly greeted.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Luo Bu, are you getting used to being in the \u2018Desert Metal Mercenary Company\u2019?\u201d Xiao Yan inquired with a smile.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s smile, Luo Bu hurriedly nodded his head. Currently, the news of the death of the First Elder in the Mo clan had almost spread throughout the eastern region of the Jia Ma Empire. Although other people may not be clear about who the killer was, Luo Bu knew very clearly in his heart that the person who did it was definitely this young man in front of him who appeared totally harmless.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Luo Bu. Since you are idling around with nothing to do, can you help me with an experiment?\u201d Xiao Yan asked with another smile. He did not wait for Luo Bu to nod his head. Instead, he immediately lifted his feet and walked out of the shaded place. Although Xiao Yan\u2019s current strength had already returned to the Dou Shi class, Xiao Yan knew clearly that when dealing with a person like Luo Bu, Luo Bu would immediately be suspicious if someone was to suddenly become friendly with him.</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words, Luo Bu was at a loss. Instantly, he smiled bitterly and shook his head before lifting his feet to follow.</p><br/><p>Standing off to the side, Xiao Ding and Xiao Li saw this strange action, and could not help but exchange glances. After which, they also followed with curiosity.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly came to a stop at a corner of the training ground. He faced Luo Bu who was somewhat uneasy and said with a slight smile, \u201cYou should use all your strength to defend. I want to try to figure just how much strength the thing that I have just modified has.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Hearing this, the corner of Luo Bu\u2019s mouth quivered. His expression became somewhat purple. Xiao Yan had actually planned to use him as a target.</p><br/><p>Xiao Ding and the others were all part of the upper echelon of the Desert Metal Mercenary Company. When the other company members in the training ground saw them gathering, they immediately began surrounding the place as they curiously watched Xiao Yan and Luo Bu at the middle of it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan reminded Luo Bu, whose expression was both green and purple before he shook his finger. A red colored Danwan appeared, which he threw into his mouth in front of everyone\u2019s gaze. He chewed slightly and a moment later, opened his mouth. A cluster of hot purple colored flame was spit out and steadily landed on his hand which was isolated by Dou Qi.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gently tossed this cluster of purple flame and smiled. Then he extended his right hand and a green colored flame slowly rose\u2026</p><br/><p>Eyeing the two different colored flame on his two hands, Hai Bo Dong was at a loss momentarily. His expression immediately changed as he muttered, \u201cDamn it. Is this little guy planning to use that trick again?\u201d</p><br/><p>As fear gradually rose in Hai Bo Dong\u2019s eyes, Xiao Yan, who was in the training ground, actually began to slowly place his two palms together\u2026</p><br/><p>Seeing this action of Xiao Yan, Hai Bo Dong\u2019s expression finally changed completely. His feet suddenly stomped on the ground and shot up into the air in a lightning like manner in front of everyone\u2019s stunned gaze. He stomped and sharply said, \u201cXiao Yan, you lunatic! The last time you almost killed yourself. You still want to try again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lifted his head and watched Hai Bo Dong in midair who had flown into a rage. His face was completely stunned. He had not expected that this old fellow would be so terrified of his \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

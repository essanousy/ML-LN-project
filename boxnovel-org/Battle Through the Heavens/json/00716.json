The three colored fire wave and the deep-green Dou Qi were mixing with each other all over the sky. Finally, they acted like the churning ocean waves as they swept in all directions.</p><br/><p>The sweeping of the frightening fire wave in all directions affected the chaotic battleground in the distant sky. Those who responded quickly managed to escape from the danger but those who were slightly slower were struck head on by the fire wave. Immediately, their chests seemed to have received a violent hammer-like blow and a mouthful of fresh bright-red blood that carried some heat was spat out. The blood swiftly vaporized under the high temperature of the fire wave.</p><br/><p>The sunlight that scattered down from the sky had also vanished at this moment. A four colored fire wave appeared to be like layers of dark clouds that covered the sky above the Misty Cloud Mountain. Even sunlight had difficulty penetrating this thick fire cloud layer.</p><br/><p>The fire wave carried a frightening energy that swept horizontally across the sky. With the exception of a small number of people, the remaining experts desperately descended, afraid of ending up in a miserable state if they were to be tainted by that fire wave.</p><br/><p>Cluck!</p><br/><p>The fire-red clouds shrouded the sky, reflecting a dark-red light that reflected on the numerous stunned faces in the open ground. A moment later, the sound of saliva being swallowed repeatedly sounded. The trembling hands of some people wiped off the cold sweat on their forehead. In front of this frightening strength that, could nearly be compared with that of nature, caused even experts at the Dou Wang class to feel extremely small and weak.</p><br/><p>This kind of strength was far from what someone of their class could contend with!</p><br/><p>Hai Bodong and the others rushed down from the sky and landed on the top of a tall tree. Their appearances were somewhat miserable. The fire waves frightening energy that had swept over a moment ago had caught them off guard. However, it was fortunate that their actual strength was quite great. Hence, they did not receive many serious injuries despite looking miserable.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Everyone revealed themselves, looked at each other before opening their mouths to check on everyone else.</p><br/><p>Hai Bodong let out a bitter laugh. His gaze swept over the experts by his side and immediately knit his brows slightly. After the big battle earlier, their side had at the very least lost three expert Dou Wangs despite them having managed to cause the Misty Cloud Sect to lose some Elders. The intensity of this big battle had far exceeded everyone\u2019s expectations.</p><br/><p>That old Yin Gu, Su Mei, and Wu Tie had a hint of a green color on their faces while everyone was doing a head count. This was because most of the few Dou Wangs who they had unluckily lost were their subordinates.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis damn Misty Cloud Sect!\u201d The three people exchanged glances with one another before clenching their teeth and quietly cursing. These expert Dou Wangs were not people whom they could just randomly groom. The loss of a few of them was sufficient to cause their flesh to feel a great pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how is Xiao Yan?\u201d Lin Yan\u2019s face was currently somewhat pale. However, his eyes had an unusual heat flickering within. From the looks of it, their fight this time around might be extremely brutal but it was to his taste. Based on his perspective, one should live a life that was filled with stimulation. The sparing feeling from the academy was far from able to satisfy his battle addicted heart.</p><br/><p>Lin Xiu Ya and Liu Qing beside him shook their heads when they heard this. The faces of these two were not very good either. Each of them had some injuries on their bodies but these were not considered too serious.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026 but this fellow really hid a lot of strength. Even though I already thought highly of him, I still did not expect that he could fight with an elite Dou Zong. It should be known\u2026 that this fellow\u2019s strength is merely at the peak of the Dou Wang class. If the matter here were to be transmitted back to the Inner Academy, it is likely that even First Elder Su Qian would be greatly surprised.\u201d Lin Xiu Ya\u2019s and Liu Qing\u2019s words contained a helpless feeling. It seems that the difficulty of them surpassing Xiao Yan had grown by a limitless amount.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if he is dead or alive within that fire wave. This fellow is unable to even escape from some of the Dou Skills that he uses.\u201d Zi Yan\u2019s gem-like eyes looked toward the thick fire cloud that covered the sky. She clenched her teeth. Although she had spoken in this manner, there was still some worry on her little face.</p><br/><p>Lin Yan and the others raised their heads. Their gazes looked at the thick cloud layer that faintly revealed three different glows of color. They frowned slightly and felt somewhat uneasy within their hearts. The opponent that this fellow faced was a genuine elite Dou Zong\u2026</p><br/><p>During the time that Hai Bodong and the others clustered together, the Elders from the Misty Cloud Sect also appeared on the wedding stage in the open ground. They looked at each other\u2019s miserable appearances and their faces became much uglier when they discovered that they were missing one-quarter of the people present before the fight.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun, who was around the wedding stage, felt her heart sink violently when he saw the reduced number of Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s Elders who had appeared. It was really unexpected that the Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s losses would actually be this severe.</p><br/><p>Moreover, no one knew whether Yun Shan was alive within the fire cloud in the sky. Although everyone knew the great strength of an elite Dou Zong, everyone had clearly sensed just what kind of frightening energy was contained in the three colored fire lotus that Xiao Yan had unleashed. Hence, despite them being extremely clear about Yun Shan\u2019s strength, they were still filled with uncertainty.</p><br/><p>All the Elders displayed similarly uncertain faces as they raised their heads and looked at the sky. A moment later, they exchanged glances with one another and involuntarily threw their gazes to Yun Yun below. Although Yun Yun had already been stripped of her position of sect leader during these few years, she was still someone who had been the sect leader for a long time. Hence, Yun Yun\u2019s reputation within the Misty Cloud Sect could at the very least be a steady second despite it not being comparable with Yun Shan. Now that it was uncertain whether Yun Shan was dead or alive, these Elders naturally thought of Yun Yun as the person in charge.</p><br/><p>Yun Yun did not bother about the gazes of all the Elders. She clearly knew just what kind of dangerous situation the current Misty Cloud Sect faced. It is not overboard to say that it was a situation of survival or death.</p><br/><p>Bang!</p><br/><p>While everyone had thrown their gazes toward the fire cloud of an unknown thickness in the sky, a part of the fire cloud suddenly began to fluctuate intensely. Two human figures immediately rushed forward with one at the front and one at the back.</p><br/><p>The two human figures, that suddenly appeared, naturally attracted all the eyes present the moment they did so. However, after everyone had a clear look, they realized that these two were not Xiao Yan and Yun Shan but Protector Wu and Yao Lao.</p><br/><p>The two people\u2019s bodies descended quite a lot after being forced out of the fire cloud before they stabilized their bodies. At this moment, the appearances of these two people were completely different from earlier. The strange black fog that covered Protector Yun\u2019s body had completely scattered at this moment. His chest was rising and falling intensely and a heavy, rough panting sound repeatedly rang out. A large black-colored cloak covered his entire body and a faint dark-red glow was revealed on his dark-black face.</p><br/><p>Protector Wu\u2019s condition might not be good but the illusory body of Yao Lao on the opposite side had also become much thinner. His face also appeared much older. Clearly, the two people from earlier had already undergone an extremely fierce and dangerous fight. The result of that ferocious battle seemed to be that both ended up seriously injured.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, old fellow, it is unexpected that you are still this stubborn despite not having a body. You are really worthy of being the Yao zun-zhe who is renowned throughout the continent\u2026\u201d The black-colored cloak shook slightly as Protector Yun laughed in a strange manner. His voice panted a little.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not so easy to take the spirit of this old me.\u201d Yao Lao laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>The dark-red glow under the black-colored cloak became much denser after hearing this. A somewhat low, deep sinister voice was slowly emitted, \u201cIs that so? Do you really think it is so easy to deal with this protector? Today, I will definitely capture you and return to the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 even if I have to pay a hefty price for it. Tsk tsk, the hall leader is extremely interested in your spirit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s eyes involuntarily narrowed when he heard the unusual gloominess in Protector Wu\u2019s words. An uneasiness also began to rise within his heart. He knew extremely little about these monsters from the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019. He was however unaware of just what ending tactics they used\u2026</p><br/><p>The thick fire cloud in the air suddenly rippled just as this thought rotated within Yao Lao\u2019s heart. An enormous swirl appeared and the swirl began to rotate. Following the increase in the intensity of the rotation, the spreading fire cloud began to show a torrent-like disturbance.</p><br/><p>Two slight \u2018puff\u2019 sounds suddenly appeared when the swirl reached a certain rotation speed. Two human figures were immediately violently spat out by that swirl-like garbage.</p><br/><p>The appearance of the two human figures immediately caused everyone present to throw their gaze over. Everyone sighed in relief when their gaze swept over the two people. Clearly, these two fellows were the main characters of that battleground, Xiao Yan and Yun Shan.</p><br/><p>The two human figures fell toward the ground after being spat out by the fire cloud. From the looks of their appearances, the two people seemed to have descended into an unconscious state during the soul-stirring energy explosion.</p><br/><p>During the time everyone was stunned, a human figure, who was to the back, suddenly trembled. His tightly shut eyes were also slowly opened amid the whirling wind by the side of his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat person had woken up? Who is he?\u201d</p><br/><p>The human figure who woke up controlled his descending body immediately stirring the attention of the countless number of people in the open ground. Numerous exclamations immediately sounded.</p><br/><p>The awakened human figure did not bother about the exclamations that the people below had transmitted over. His body paused for a moment before his shoulders shook and a pair of jade-green fire wings surged and appeared from his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan! It\u2019s Xiao Yan!\u201d</p><br/><p>The familiar fire wings immediately revealed the identity of the human figure. Immediately, numerous exclamations and cheers sounded in the open ground.</p><br/><p>The moment the jade-fire wings on his back appeared, Xiao Yan suddenly charged toward the repeatedly descending Yun Shan below. The little remaining Dou Qi within his body was completely drawn out before being wrapped around his fist which he viciously smashed downward. He clearly understood that despite the unusually great strength possessed by the \u2018Angry Buddha Lotus Flame\u2019 formed from the merger of three \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019, it would still be quite difficult for one to kill an elite Dou Zong by just relying on this. Hence, he must grab the opportunity when Yun Shan\u2019s internal body was weak to beat him when he is down. Otherwise, once Yun Shan were to recover by even a little, the one who had his eyes shut while awaiting death would be Xiao Yan instead.</p><br/><p>This action of Xiao Yan once again stirred a countless number of exclamations from the open ground. Anyone could tell that Yun Shan\u2019s defense was at its weakest at this very moment. Should he receive a heavy blow now, he would definitely die or become disabled.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan swiftly rushed to Yun Shan\u2019s front under the countless number of gazes filled with shock and wild joy. At this moment, the latter was able to open his eyes and possess some consciousness. Hence, a terror finally involuntarily spread out from his heart when he saw the savage smile and killing intent that surfaced on Xiao Yan\u2019s face. He could sense that if Xiao Yan were to really use a killing move at this very moment, his ending\u2026</p><br/><p>The sinister smile on the corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth also grew increasingly wider as he looked at the shock and terror that had surged on Yun Shan\u2019s face. A weak voice was transmitted into Yun Shan\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld dog, I already said back then that I will definitely make you regret allowing me to flee on my last breath. Xiao Yan has remembered this debt for three years. Today, I shall repay it all to you!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After which, an elderly figure appeared in front of many people\u2019s eyes. This figure raised his arm the moment he appeared. Two majestic Dou Qi pillars that contained a powerful lightning glow explosively shot toward the Gu Qian duo below.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Qian and Gu Xu were extremely furious when they saw this figure attacking as he pleased. Before they could curse out loud, they hurriedly pulled back while wearing ugly expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The two vast lightning glows shot through the sky like a meteorites. However, before they could strike the bodies of the duo, an invisible force suddenly spread. This force coincidentally received the two lightning glows.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan looked at the elderly figure descending from the sky. He was stunned when he saw that somewhat familiar face because he had discovered that the old man who had intervened and aided him was actually that mysterious old man he had met at the empty realm lightning pool. The one that was always saying \u201cIs this right?\u201d An exclamation was involuntarily emitted from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you your head. Do you know how to be polite? Call me headmaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>That elder with the surname Mang blew at his beard and chided when he heard Xiao Yan\u2019s exclamation.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeadmaster?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes were a little at a loss. A moment later, he finally recovered. He was stunned as he watched the elder with the surname Mang in front of him, \u201cYou\u2026 you are the headmaster of the Jia Nan Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat nonsense! Other than the old me, who is called Mang Tian Chi, who would dare call himself this?\u201d The old man\u2019s beard rose a little. He smiled as he observed Xiao Yan. After which, he extended his hand and pinched him. Only then did he laugh, \u201cNot bad, not bad. That fellow Su Qian did not lie to me. He has finally taught a student who appears acceptable\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth twitched. He looked at the smiling old man in front of him. For a moment, he found it difficult to connect this person to the extremely mysterious Inner Academy headmaster of the Jia Nan Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI actually failed to recognize you when we met last. After returning and thinking about it for a couple of days, I finally remembered that you are the Xiao Yan. That fellow Su Qian repeatedly told me about you through his messages\u2026\u201d Mang Tian Chi patted Xiao Yan\u2019s chest. He appeared extremely righteous as he said, \u201cYou can rest assured. Since you are a student of the Jia Nan Academy and a student who meets the strict standards of the old me, the old me will protect you if any problems occur in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan bitterly smiled. This old fellow really did not appear like a mysterious headmaster. Instead, he was like an old bandit who had just barged out of a bandit\u2019s nest.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you old mister Mang.\u201d Xun Er by the side also recovered from her shock as she spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a small matter\u2026\u201d Mang Tian Chi randomly waved his hand. After which, his eyes roamed over Xun Er and Xiao Yan. He said with a strange smile, \u201cI was wondering why they have been making things difficult for a member of the younger generation like you. You have actually grasped the most outstanding flower of the Gu clan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face was a little green when he heard these words. Xun Er\u2019s face by the side also flushed a bright red.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld mister Mang, this is not the Lei clan!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Gu Qian duo, who had been forced back by the lightning glow earlier, stepped forward with furious expressions. Gu Qian spoke with a deep voice at this moment.</p><br/><p>Mang Tian Chi glanced at the two of them, but he ignored them. His eyes shifted to an area of empty space as he said, \u201cOld demon Shan. You should stop favoring these two old fellows. Ordering a person to cause trouble for a member of the younger generation clearly shows that you are a little too narrow-minded.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGu Qian, Gu Xu, withdraw\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The empty space fluctuated slightly and a black-robed white-haired old man appeared in a strange manner. He descended from the sky. He cupped his hands to the cold-faced Xun Er before looking at Mang Tian Chi. He sighed somewhat helplessly and said, \u201cOld fellow, since you wish to step forward, I shall give you face this time around.\u201d</p><br/><p>This white-haired old man swung his sleeves after uttering these words before walking to some seats a short distance away. He had never once glanced at Xiao Yan throughout the entire exchange.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi, still acting cool for the old me\u2026\u201d Mang Tian Chi curled his lips when he saw the back of the white-haired old man. After which, his eyes landed on Xiao Yan. He wanted to say something, but merely patted his back in the end. He said, \u201cLittle fellow, you are quite bold. You obviously know that someone in the Gu clan will find fault with you, yet you dared to come here. However, you can rest assured. Su Qian has sent me a couple of messages. All of the messages have requested me to take good care of you should I meet you. Those old fellows from the Gu clan will still give me face here. However, you should understand that you will have to rely on yourself if you wish to truly get those old fellows to see you in a different light.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you for your reminder headmaster.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan cupped his hands and sincerely replied. He was able to hear a concerned tone in Mang Tian Chi\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go\u2026\u201d Mang Tian Chi smiled. After which, he turned around and walked to some seats in one corner. Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment before leading the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s group, who also wore ugly expressions. Finally, they sat in the seats beside Mang Tian Chi.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat old man from earlier is called Gu Shan. He is one of the extremely experienced Elders within the Gu clan. His strength is also quite great, and he possesses some influence within the Gu clan. Moreover, he is also one of those who resolutely objects our relationship.\u201d Xun Er softly explained after they took their seats.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan quietly nodded. He could sense just how frightening Gu Shan was. It was likely that he was at least at the peak of the Dou Zun class. The number of experts within this Gu clan had indeed reached quite a frightening level.</p><br/><p>While Xiao Yan was softly chatting with Xun Er, his eyes had swept over this special area. Those who could enter this place were renowned people from the Gu clan. However, Xiao Yan saw some familiar faces among these people. They were Huo Xuan\u2019s group. Huo Xuan had chatted with him on the boat. When Xiao Yan looked at them, Huo Xuan also smiled and nodded at him</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan returned a smile to Huo Xuan. After which, he glanced at the left side of the stage. A group of people were clustered there. Most of these people were from the younger generation of the Gu clan. Xiao Yan saw Gu Zhen, Lin Xiu, Ling Quan, and a couple of Black Submerged Army commanders there. At this moment, the eyes of the few of them were staring at him in a gloating manner.</p><br/><p>Such an expression in their eyes caused Xiao Yan to slightly frown. He had just withdrew his eyes when they suddenly gathered on a corner at the front. A figure with a sharp murderous aura was seated at that spot. This person had black and white hair. The aura all over his body was as cold as ten thousand-year-old mysterious ice. One felt a chill over one\u2019s entire body when one looked at him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes were grave as he studied this statue-like back. He could sense a wave of familiar killing desire slowly spreading from the body of this person. Moreover, the target of this killing intent was him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevil general, Gu Yao!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly exhaled a breath of air. The fist under his sleeve suddenly tightened. Such a killing intent was the same as the one he had sensed yesterday. Clearly, this should be that devil general, whom Xun Er had said was a great threat to him.</p><br/><p>As the target of this wave of killing intent, it was obvious that Xiao Yan\u2019s every action had been absorbed by Gu Yao ever since Xiao Yan had arrived. Xiao Yan\u2019s act of staring at Gu Yao was probably being sensed by him.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person will be a strong opponent!\u201d</p><br/><p>A solemness flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. The most troublesome opponent of the same generation of Xiao Yan was likely this so-called devil general.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, be careful of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er also sensed when Xiao Yan had stared at the icy-cold back. She clenched her hand. A chill flashed across her pretty eyes as she softly spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdditionally, the Heavenly Tomb will open soon after the adult ceremony is completed. You can enter that place with your qualification. However, some Elders will obstruct you\u2026\u201d Xun Er frowned as she spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can relax. I will help speak up for this little fellow when the time comes. It is likely that those old fellows from your clan will not make things overly difficult for him on account of my old face.\u201d Mang Tian Chi at the front stretched his lazy waist as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I will thank old mister Mang.\u201d Xun Er immediately laughed when she heard his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cWon\u2019t you purposefully speak for the old me to hear? Little girl, you are trying to pull some schemes in front of the old me\u2026\u201d Mang Tian Chi rolled his eyes as he replied.</p><br/><p>Xun Er smiled but did not refute the claim. It would be a little too wasteful if one did not use such a good bargaining chip.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, Xiao Yan must successfully pass this test if he wishes to enter the Heavenly Tomb. You should be aware of what I am talking about\u2026\u201d Mang Tian Chi turned his head to glance at Xiao Yan. After which, his chin was lifted to ice-cold back in front. He softly said, \u201cAs long as you are able to last one hundred exchanges in the hands of that fellow without being defeated, that will be enough to silence some old fellows. The matter of entering the Heavenly Tomb will also be much easier then.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA hundred exchanges?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was slightly startled, but he did not say anything. The fist under his sleeve was gently clenched. This was not the result that he needed!</p><br/><p>\u201cGong!\u201d</p><br/><p>An ancient \u2018gong\u2019 sound suddenly rang around this stadium when Xiao Yan clenched his fist. The \u2018gong\u2019 sound spread in a mighty manner. It spread over this spacious mountain range.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime\u2019s up. Let the ceremony begin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After the gong sound appeared, a calm voice filled with a great might was suddenly emitted from empty space. That voice contained a frightening pressure that caused quite a number of people in the stadium to gently inhale a breath of cool air.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Dou Sheng, a genuine Dou Sheng!\u201d</p><br/><p>A shocked expression appeared in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes as he sensed the pressure that originated from deep within his soul. This was the first time that he had sensed a genuine Dou Sheng pressure.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

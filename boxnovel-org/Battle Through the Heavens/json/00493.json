When he discovered that the red glow in his eyes was much better compared to back then, he nodded slightly and softly spoke, \u201cLooks like the consumption of the \u2018Ice Spirit Pill\u2019 and the external application of the \u2018Marrow Washing Cold Spirit Liquid\u2019 have an extremely notable results with the removal of this \u2018Fire Poison.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, it is indeed very effective. Each time after I train in the water in which one drop of \u2018Marrow Washing Cold Spirit Liquid\u2019 is placed, that water would turn as red as blood. Moreover, I also sensed the Fire Poison in my body swiftly becoming weaker.\u201d Lin Yan\u2019s face was filled with excitement. This problem which had worried him for a long while could finally be completely cured now. This was undoubtedly extremely good news for him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think that if you use these medicines the way they should be used for another month, the Fire Poison in your body should be completely expelled.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and took out a bottle of \u2018Ice Spirit Pill\u2019 and \u2018Marrow Washing Cold Spirit Liquid.\u2019 These medicines were completely refined by him while he was in his retreat. Hence, he saved the trouble of refining them again at this moment.</p><br/><p>Lin Yan snatched the two bottles of medicine from Xiao Yan\u2019s hand in a lightning-like manner. He parted his mouth and smiled. He flung his hand and a pale-green-colored shadow was shot toward Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan dexterously received the green shadow that was shot over. There was a pale warm jade-like item in his hand. Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes drifted and he was somewhat surprised to realize that this pale-green shadow was actually the \u2018Green Wood Celestial Vine.\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d Xiao Yan held the \u2018Green Wood Celestial Vine\u2019 tightly in his hand as he raised his head to speak to Lin Yan, \u201cAren\u2019t you afraid that the medicine that I gave you will not completely cure you and you are giving this to me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not like you are by yourself. Such a big \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 is present here. Do I need to be afraid of where you can run off to? Moreover, after personally experiencing it, I am even more clearly aware just how good the effect of this thing is than you, the person who refined it.\u201d Lin Yan rolled his eyes, curled his lips and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, in that case, thank you very much.\u201d Xiao Yan cupped his hands toward Lin Yan and carefully stored this \u2018Green Wood Celestial Vine,\u2019 which he had obtained with great difficulty, within his storage ring. He immediately heaved a long sigh of relief in his heart. With this, he was only left with the final two ingredients needed to refine the \u2018Ground Spirit Pill.\u2019 However, the last two were also items that were extremely difficult to obtain...</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, now that I have obtained the thing I need, I should also be going.\u201d Lin Yan waved his hand toward Xiao Yan before turning around and walking out of the door. Just before he exited through the door, he turned around and smiled as he said to Xiao Yan, \u201cAlthough there is a mixture of a transaction between us, I, Lin Yan still owe you a favor. Don\u2019t tell me that this green vine can be used as payment. My life is much more valuable than a withered branch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan could only smile bitterly when he heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that Liu Qing comes and finds trouble with you in the future, you can send someone to inform me. I have not exchange blows with that fellow for a long while. I wonder how much sharper and overbearing his \u2018Mountain Splitting Spear\u2019 is compared to the past?\u201d After saying this, Lin Yan exited the room and his footsteps gradually became distant.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough this fellow has a violent temper, he may be considered a person one can befriend.\u201d Xiao Yan laughed softly as he shook his head. He stood up, stretched his lazy waist before slowly walking out of the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, how much \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 is remaining on your Fire Crystal Card?\u201d Xun Er played with the three green-colored Fire Crystal Cards on her hand within the hall. As she eyed the number on it, she involuntarily smiled bitterly and shook her head. After which, she raised her head and asked Xiao Yan, who had just descended from the upper floor, a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 it appears like there is only thirty plus more\u2026 it is not even enough to train for ten days in the fourth level.\u201d Xiao Yan was initially startled before he immediately replied helplessly.</p><br/><p>Xun Er sighed when she heard this. Her expression appeared a little vexed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Do you all need \u2018Fire Energy?\u2019\u201d Xiao Yan could not help but be stunned as he asked upon seeing this manner that she displayed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is not that we need but our \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 needs it\u2026\u201d Hu Jia to the side continued from where Xun Er left off as she said, \u201cIt is not like you don\u2019t know that some of the rewards of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 requires \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019 Now that \u2018Pan Gate\u2019 has just started, those \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 rewards that are required would naturally come from our own pockets. Xun Er\u2019s \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 is almost used up. Recently, she did not even enter the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 to train even once\u2026 I have exchanged for a Dou Technique a while back so I don\u2019t have much left. Now, I have handed over all of it. As for Wu Hao\u2026 this fellow is fast losing more than he makes in the Fighting Arena.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Hao\u2019s face involuntarily turned red when he heard the last couple of words that Hu Jia said. He laughed dryly, \u201cIt is because I am not used to it in the past. Recently, my winning percentage is increasing. Not long later, I should be able to earn back my losses.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the time you earn back your losses, \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 will have lost credibility due to the problem of not being able to pay some of the internal rewards. Once our credibility is lost, I\u2019m afraid that those new members who have come after hearing about the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 will immediately leave.\u201d Hu Jia threw a look at him as she coldly snorted.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan could not help but feel some guilt when he heard Hu Jia saying this. He had been merrily training, but Xun Er and Hu Jia had not even entered the tower for even a day\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge need not think too much about it. You are currently the face of our \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 outside. This face naturally requires strength in order to support it. Without your deterrent effect outside, it would be difficult for this \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 to rise no matter what kind of measures we used.\u201d Xun Er appeared to understand the guilt in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart as she spoke gently with a slight smile.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed bitterly. He mused for a long while before slowly speaking, \u201cNow that the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 which everyone earned during the \u2018Fire Energy Hunting Competition\u2019 is about to be exhausted, it is indeed time for us to plan how to earn \u2018Fire Energy\u2019... Do you know how can one obtain \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 within the Inner Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe most inefficient method is to take up some cleaning type of low grade task within the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower.\u2019 However, this method would be too slow and it is also quite tiring. Hence, most of the people would wait for the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 to be distributed by the Inner Academy each month. However, there are also some stronger people who would choose to enter the Fighting Arena and use their fighting results to win some \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019 This method is much faster but not as stable. This is because if there is the event where one meets an even stronger opponent, one would not only be unable to win \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 but would also lose quite a lot of it.\u201d Xun Er\u2019s delicate hand pulled apart her black hair that had drifted in front of her forehead while she voiced her thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are also some people who enter deep into the mountains to hunt for Magical Beasts to search for various different kinds of medicinal ingredients. Moreover, outside of the Inner Academy are vast mountains that stretch for thousands of kilometers. Such a vast region does not lack some of the caves that the predecessors left behind. If one were lucky to find one, it would be an unexpected windfall. Those high class Dou Techniques, Qi Methods, etc. that were left behind by the ancient people sell very well within the Inner Academy. Moreover, the price usually leans toward the higher end.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan crossed his ten fingers together and quietly nodded. He asked softly, \u201cWill anyone use \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 to purchase medicinal pills within the Inner Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOne can naturally do so. Medicinal pills are extremely rare items that can be compared with Qi Techniques and Dou Skills.\u201d Xun Er smiled and nodded. Her wandering eyes stopped on Xiao Yan\u2019s body. Those watery pupils of hers contained a faint smile, \u201cWhy? Does Xiao Yan ge-ge intend to sell medicinal pills?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my area of expertise. Naturally, I cannot abandon it.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and said, \u201cAre there any other people selling medicinal pills within the Inner Academy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er\u2019s eyebrows were suddenly knit slightly together when this was mentioned. She smiled bitterly and nodded as she spoke, \u201cThere are indeed other people doing this. Moreover, it is not a person but a faction.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFaction?\u201d Xiao Yan was startled when he heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis faction\u2019s name is called the \u2018Medicine Gang.\u2019 Everyone in the gang is an alchemist that entered the Inner Academy from the Alchemist Department\u2026\u201d Xun Er voiced her thoughts, \u201cThis \u2018Medicine Gang\u2019 basically has a monopoly of over ninety percent of the medicinal pills being sold in the Inner Academy. Some of the other fragmented alchemists have difficulty contending against them. It is said that the leader of the \u2018Medicine Gang\u2019 is even able to refine a tier four medicinal pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we are also going to sell medicinal pills, I\u2019m afraid that we will come into direct conflict with this \u2018Medicine Gang.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBeing able to refine a tier four medicinal pill huh\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He smiled faintly and said, \u201cLet\u2019s not bother too much. After all, we also need to survive. Competition is naturally unavoidable. I am not afraid of them as long as they don\u2019t use underhanded tactics.\u201d Being only able to refine a tier four medicinal pill. Speaking from the view of Xiao Yan, who had successfully refined the \u2018Three-Lines Green Spirit Pill,\u2019 this leader was an opponent that was not too tricky to defeat.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Xiao Yan did not shrink back, Xun Er also nodded. She smiled and said, \u201cSince this is the case, our \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 shall also sell medicinal pills. However, if this is the case, Xiao Yan ge-ge might have to toil a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs the leader of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019, I naturally need to contribute a little. Otherwise, won\u2019t I die of guilt when compared to all of you?\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to sell medicinal pills, I suggest that you focus on the Fighting Arena. Everyday, there are people there who are injured because of a fight. Moreover, if you do not need too many materials to refine the medicinal pill that can recover Dou Qi, like the one you gave us to consume during the Hunting Competition back then, it is likely that there would be countless people competing to purchase it.\u201d Wu Hao suggested. Having recently and frequently muddled along in the Fighting Arena, he naturally knew what kind of medicinal pill was valuable and scarce at that place.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Energy Recovery Pill\u2019 huh\u2026 It is not very difficult but don\u2019t tell me that the \u2018Medicine Gang\u2019 is unable to refine this kind of medicinal pill that can recover Dou Qi?\u201d Xiao Yan mused for a while before he smiled and nodded. With his current refining skills, refining the \u2018Energy Recovery Pill\u2019 was an extremely easy matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey can\u2026 But the kind of medicinal pill which recovers Dou Qi that they refine does not have the same effect as your \u2018Energy Recovery Pill.\u2019 I bought one once, spending two days of \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019 Therefore, I can differentiate the difference between the two of them.\u201d Wu Hao shook his head and said.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He leaned his body on the back of the chair. His eyes suddenly brightened as he laughed softly, \u201cOther than the Fighting Arena, perhaps within the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 is also a good place to swallow medicinal pills. The people training within it do not dare to train for a long time because they are afraid of the Fire Poison invading their bodies. If there is a kind of medicinal pill that can enable them to ignore the encroachment of the Fire Poison for a period of time, I think that there would likely be many people happy to purchase it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIgnore the encroachment of the Fire Poison?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, completely ignoring it would naturally be extremely difficult. However, the pill will allow a person to extend their stay of one day to two\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and explained.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, this will indeed be an immense attraction for those people who are in a hurry to train\u2026\u201d Xun Er and the other two exchanged gazes and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, let us decide it this way. From tomorrow on, I will give all of you a list that contains all the medicinal ingredients needed to refine the medicinal pills. All of you will go around and purchase them. Just leave the matter of refining the pills to me\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Instead, it was covered by an illusory aura. This kind of aura was not foreign to Xiao Yan because it was Spiritual Strength!</p><br/><p>In other words, the Old Ying Shan in the mountain forest below was not his actual body. Instead, it was an avatar agglomerated from his soul!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder this old fellow would leave the city in such a high profile manner. It was actually a fake spiritual body. Now, the actual Old Ying Shan might have long since taken the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva and left the Black Emperor City.\u201d This thought rushed through Xiao Yan\u2019s heart in a lightning-like manner. His expression gradually turned dark and solemn. Everyone here seemed to have been played by this old fellow.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan did not know how Old Ying Shan was actually able to use his spirit to form such a powerful fake body, a fake was ultimately a fake. Under the probing of Xiao Yan\u2019s Spiritual Perception, the latter had already been completely exposed to Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. However\u2026 it was a little too late now. With that old fellow\u2019s speed, this short while gave him enough time to flee to a remote mountain forest in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. Given Old Ying Shan\u2019s strength, if he were to hide his aura, it was likely that even an elite Dou Zun would not be able to find him in the vast mountains.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? What have you discovered?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s gloomy expression was swiftly sensed by Su Qian, the Little Fairy Doctor, and the others beside him. All of them immediately asked in a soft surprised whisper.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Old Ying Shan below is a fake. The Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva is also not with him.\u201d Xiao Yan slowly exhaled and explained with a gloomy expression.</p><br/><p>These words of Xiao Yan was undoubtedly like thunder that shook everyone until they became stunned. It was a long while later before Su Qian took the lead in recovering. He frowned and said, \u201cA fake? Why is his aura so similar?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis should be something created by Old Ying Shan\u2019s spirit. We have underestimated his tactics. This unusual spiritual avatar is something that I have only seen for the first time. Other than my teacher, I\u2019m afraid that he is the best person I have met who can manipulate his Spiritual Strength until such an extent.\u201d Xiao Yan slowly replied. His eyes coldly stared at \u2018Old Ying Shan,\u2019 who did not appear to panic despite being surrounded and attacked by so many people below.</p><br/><p>Using one\u2019s spirit to create an avatar. This kind of unique method to use Spiritual Strength was something that Xiao Yan had never seen. He had also never seen Yao Lao display this. Despite this, he was naturally aware that Yao Lao definitely far surpassed Old Ying Shan when it came to the use of Spiritual Strength. After all, the renowned name of Yao zun-zhe (respectful name for a Dou Zun) did not come from nowhere.</p><br/><p>Dou Zun. That was a level that was even further and more frightening than a Dou Zong. At that level, one was already a top person on the continent. Their methods were far from what an elite Dou Zong could compare with.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpiritual avatar?\u201d Su Qian and thr Little Fairy Doctor were stunned when they heard Xiao Yan\u2019s words. Although they were also elite Dou Zongs, the two of them admitted that they could not agglomerate their spirit into an avatar and allow it to possess quite a great amount of genuine strength. It was unexpected that Old Ying Shan was actually able to reach such a level.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do now? Since this is a fake, it is likely that the real Old Ying Shan would have left long ago.\u201d Xiao Li knit his brows and softly cursed, \u201cThis old fellow is really crafty. He actually possessed such a tactic.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes. A moment later, he suddenly shut his eyes. His Spiritual Perception once again surged out. However, this time around, it did not rush toward Old Ying Shan. Instead, it lingered over the sky and repeatedly scanned to and fro.</p><br/><p>Although using Spiritual Strength to agglomerate an avatar might enable the avatar to possess the aura of the original body and some of its strength, there would still be a slight connection regardless of how far apart the avatar and the actual body were. Although this connection was extremely faint and thin, it did still exist. If he found a thread of this invisible connection, he might be able to find out where the actual body of Old Ying Shan was.</p><br/><p>Powerful Spiritual Strengths crossed each other in the sky, forming an invisible spiritual net which carefully swept to and fro\u2026</p><br/><p>Normally, experts who specialized in training Dou Qi did not attach much importance to Spiritual Strength. Hence, on the whole, the people who possessed strong Spiritual Strengths on the Dou Qi continent were alchemists. This was because Spiritual Perception was something that was necessary to refind pills. The sharpness of one\u2019s Spiritual Perception was determined by the strength of one\u2019s Spiritual Strength. Being an outstanding person among these people, Xiao Yan\u2019s Spiritual Strength was something that even Yao Lao could not stop praising. Hence, it was not impossible to rely on the strength of his Spiritual Strength to search Old Ying Shan\u2019s spiritual connection.</p><br/><p>Su Qian and the others ceased their conversations when they saw Xiao Yan shut his eyes. They could vaguely sense an invisible strength be emitted from Xiao Yan\u2019s body. It quietly spread through the sky like waves of water\u2026</p><br/><p>The bloody mess in the mountain forest continued. Perhaps it was because of the yells of death that resounded over the place, but some factions, that had originally remained still, were unable to contain their eagerness anymore. During this period of time, there were even quite a number of experts who joined hands to approach Old Ying Shan\u2019s body. However, they still ended up seriously wounded by the latter and were forced to retreat after spitting out blood.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan, who had his eyes tightly shut, suddenly opened them while Old Ying Shan and the few experts collided. Immediately, his eyes turned to the eastern direction. A vague spiritual fluctuation was transmitted from that area earlier\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you found it?\u201d After looking in the direction Xiao Yan was staring in, Su Qian\u2019s heart tightened as he hurriedly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have sensed something. That fellow is actually still nearby?\u201d Joy surged onto Xiao Yan\u2019s face. His eyes immediately swept over the spiritual avatar of Old Ying Shan in the forest. He decisively said, \u201cThe Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan, follow me. First Elder, all of you should keep watch over this place. I will leave some signs along the way. If you personally see this spiritual avatar disappear, you should immediately hurry over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust the three of you?\u201d Su Qian frowned and asked after hearing his orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cCurrently, no one knows just what kind of relationship this spiritual avatar and Old Ying Shan have with each other. Therefore, it is best if we are a little more cautious. It should be sufficient with just the Little Fairy Doctor and me on that side.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled. He beckoned to the Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan with his hand and did not remain any longer. Jade-green fire wings swiftly extended from his back. His body moved and rushed to the sky. He headed to the east where the spiritual fluctuation had originated from. The Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan followed close behind.</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s group sighed in relief when their gazes looked at the backs of Xiao Yan\u2019s group. From Xiao Yan\u2019s manner, it appeared that he had found some clues. As long as Old Ying Shan had not fled, there was still quite a great chance to obtain the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow, we will see just what kind of tactics this old fellow is playing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian smiled slightly. His gaze slowly turned to the spiritual body of Old Ying Shan, which was surrounded, before whispering.</p><br/><p>While the spot where Su Qian\u2019s group was located had erupted into a bloody big battle, an isolated col that was located on the eastern side of the Black Emperor City was filled with a silence.</p><br/><p>A gray-haired old man was seated with his legs crossed within the col. His eyes were tightly shut as a powerful Spiritual Strength wrapped around his body. His shriveled tree-like fingers flickered in a flower-like manner in front of him. Following each change of his ten fingers, the powerful Spiritual Strength that spread over his body would emit waves of fluctuations.</p><br/><p>The alteration continued for around ten minutes before the gray-haired old man slowly opened his eyes. A cold smile was revealed on his face. However, his expression suddenly changed when he was just about to get up. His gaze shot toward a spot outside of the col in a lightning-like manner as he coldly cried out, \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Old Ying Shan really lives up to his reputation. You are actually able to create a spiritual avatar. This really surprises the old me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When the gray-haired old man\u2019s voice sounded, one could see over ten figures slowly surfacing outside of the col. One of them was surprisingly the sect leader of the Black Emperor Sect, Mo Tian Xing. Qi Shan and Mo Ya also following close behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMo Tian Xing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Ying Shan\u2019s eyes immediately shrank a little as he looked at the human figures who had appeared. His voice was dark and cold as he asked, \u201cWhat is sect leader Mo planning to do? Don\u2019t tell me that you wish to destroy the Black Emperor Sect\u2019s reputation?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, old demon Ying, you can forget about frightening me. What can one\u2019s reputation do in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019? The people from the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 do not buy this.\u201d Mo Tian Xing smiled and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you find me?\u201d Old Ying Shan\u2019s expression slightly sank. He suddenly seemed to have thought of something and his eyes became densely cold. \u201cYou have done something to the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is but just a little Dou Qi imprint.\u201d Mo Tian Xing faintly laughed. \u201cOld demon Ying, don\u2019t delay for any more time. After using your spiritual avatar, your actual strength will have greatly diminished. With your current condition, you are no match for this ancestor (Dou Zong). Therefore, hand over the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou will let the old me leave if I hand it over to you?\u201d Old Ying Shan replied with a cold smile.</p><br/><p>Mo Tian Xing smiled and shook his head. He said, \u201cImpossible. However, I can invite you to be a long term guest at my Black Emperor Sect.\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Old Ying Shan\u2019s mouth slightly twitched when he heard this. A savageness immediately surfaced in his eyes as he ferociously laughed, \u201cMo Tian Xing, even the condition of this old me is not at its peak, you are really thinking simply if you want to snatch the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva from my hands!\u201d</p><br/><p>A majestic aura suddenly surged out from Old Ying Shan\u2019s body after his words sounded. Under the pressure of this majestic aura, the members of the Black Emperor Sect present, with the exception of Mo Tian Xing, took a couple of hurried steps back. Only then did they stabilize their bodies.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, I will give it a try.\u201d A dense coldness also surfaced on the corner of Mo Tian Xing\u2019s mouth. He waved his sleeves and a majestic aura that did not lose to Old Ying Shan\u2019s surged out like floodwater!</p><br/><p>Two monstrous auras spread and collided within this small col. The spatial ripple that they created shook the col until it began to tremble. Numerous crack lines as thick as one\u2019s arm slowly climbed to the mountain peaks.</p><br/><p>The two conflicting auras created a tense atmosphere of swords being drawn within the col. Just as a soul-stirring battle was about to erupt, a clear laugh suddenly resounded over the sky.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, it is unexpected that the real show is actually here. I nearly missed it.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

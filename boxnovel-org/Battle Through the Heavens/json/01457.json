He naturally understood that the Ancient Void Dragon tribe had been divided into four factions. Other than the Eastern Dragon Island that Zi Yan occupied, the other three large dragon islands were all being controlled by three great dragon kings. This title, \u2018dragon king,\u2019 was only used to address those three island chiefs since they possessed great power.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are not people sent by Zi Yan. Instead, they are from the other three large dragon islands.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan frowned. He had not received any news related to the Ancient Void Dragon tribe after having left the Eastern Dragon Island back then. The island was located within the empty space. Regardless of how intense the battle that erupted between them was, it would not be able to reach the Central Plains. It was likely that no one other than the Ancient Void Dragon tribe themselves knew that they were in a civil war.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder which dragon king has sent these people. They have left empty space to come to the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe. It is likely that they are up to something.\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes flickered. Zi Yan should have successfully exited her retreat after so many years. After she exited her retreat, she would definitely need to resolve the civil war of the ancient dragon tribe. However, if she wished to unite the ancient dragon tribe, she needed to first finish off the three great dragon kings. Although Xiao Yan did not know how strong the three great dragon kings were, they were definitely genuine Dou Shengs. Nevertheless, Xiao Yan did not know just how many stars they had reached.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like I need to find time to enter the empty realm and investigate. Zi Yan\u2019s strength might have soared after her retreat with the help of the Dragon Phoenix Bloodline, but those three great dragon kings are also quite extraordinary. I must head over and lend her a hand.\u201d Xiao Yan muttered to himself within his heart. Moreover, if the Ancient Void Dragon tribe was successfully united again, its strength would definitely soar. With his relationship with Zi Yan, he would be able to pull the Ancient Void Dragon into the alliance. At that time, forget about the Hall of Souls, even the Hun clan would not dare to underestimate them.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes looked at those few figures from afar. The few of them chatted with some leaders at the deep abyss before the leaders of the abyss opened a path and allowed this group to enter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ancient Void Dragon tribe usually looks down on the other Magical Beast tribe. I wonder why this dragon king has dispatched people here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan frowned. He immediately waved his sleeve. A rich spatial force spread and wrapped around Cai Lin\u2019s group. After which, space shook as everyone disappeared.</p><br/><p>A couple of figures were rapidly rushing toward the dark underground. These few figures were quite strong. Moreover, their physical bodies also appeared extremely powerful. They did not unleash any Dou Qi. Their bodies were like falling stars that flew underground. The sound of whistling wind continued to appear.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander Qin, I wonder if we will get a reply from the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe this time around. If they are willing to lend a hand, we will be able to completely defeat the Eastern Dragon Island and be victorious in this war.\u201d A man turned his head while descending. He asked a large man, who was a short distance in front of him, a question.</p><br/><p>This person was clearly quite powerful. Even though the sound of the wind was extremely loud, his voice still managed to be transmitted into the large man\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe should be able to succeed. Our Northern Dragon Island once possessed the essence blood left behind by the Ancient Heaven Serpent. These Nine Serene Deep Ground Pythons are going crazy while searching for things that possess their ancient bloodline. Additionally, we have agreed to provide them with all sorts of benefits. They will definitely not be able to reject us.\u201d The large man in front had a square face and extremely thick eyebrows. He vaguely emitted a pressure. Clearly, he was someone who was usually in a position of authority.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, there is a true Dragon Emperor on the Eastern Dragon Island. We\u2026\u201d A man hesitated for a moment before speaking. The royal bloodline within the Ancient Void Dragon tribe pressed upon an ordinary warrior. Just thinking about their enemy being an ancient dragon that possessed a genuine royal bloodline would cause the hearts of ordinary ancient dragon warriors to feel a little unnatural.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is pointless to say all of this. Moreover, who knows if it is the truth. The Dragon King is someone with a genuine royal bloodline. We only need to listen to his orders!\u201d That large man knit his brows as he replied in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those people from earlier could only submissively agree upon hearing the large man\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph.\u201d That large man called commander Qin coldly snorted in his heart. His huge hand was waved. He was just about to increase his speed when he saw a couple of figures in the air a short distance below. His indifferent eyes slowly swept over them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are not members of the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe. Be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>That large man was a cautious person. He cried out in a deep voice after seeing those few figures. His muscles began to tense up at the same time as he prepared to entered a battle ready condition.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose in front, get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Commander Qin clenched his fist as he cried out in a cold voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay here. I have some things to ask.\u201d A skinny figure from that group slowly lifted his head when he heard the cold cry. That person was Xiao Yan. At this moment, he had lifted his hand and clenched it in commander Qin\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack!\u201d</p><br/><p>Commander Qin\u2019s expression became cold after seeing Xiao Yan lift his hand. A majestic Dou Qi immediately surged out of his body. However, this Dou Qi had just surged when he was stunned to discover that the surrounding space had completely solidified. They were just like puppets being controlled by another and had lost all ability to resist. They slowly descended and stopped in front of the skinny figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? We are members of the Ancient Void Dragon tribe!\u201d</p><br/><p>A great storm rose within commander Qin\u2019s heart after seeing that Xiao Yan\u2019s random attack could restrain all of them. He was a five star Dou Zun no matter how one put it. However, this strength did not pose the slightest resistance to the hands of the person in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you people from the Northern Dragon Island, Southern Dragon Island, or Western Dragon Island?\u201d Xiao Yan glanced at commander Qin and asked in a faint voice.</p><br/><p>Commander Qin\u2019s eyes immediately shrank after hearing this question. Only the clan members were aware that the Ancient Void Dragon tribe had split into four islands. How did this human, who had suddenly appeared, know such a secret?</p><br/><p>\u201cI do not know what you are talking about!\u201d Commander Qin did not reveal anything despite feeling shocked in his heart. Instead, he simply cried out in a stern voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was expressionless. His finger gently pressed on commander Qin. A bloody hole appeared on his body with a \u2018bang.\u2019 Blood immediately flowed from it. Commander Qin\u2019s blood was like a small stream as dripped into the abyss.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>Commander Qin\u2019s body trembled after suffering this attack. His eyes furiously glared at Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression did not fluctuate because of commander Qin\u2019s unyielding attitude. Xiao Yan continuously pressed down with his finger. One bloody hole after another blasted apart commander Qin\u2019s body. In an instant, fresh blood covered commander Qin\u2019s body. That appearance caused a couple of people\u2019s scalp to turn numb. The body of an Ancient Void Dragon was extremely strong, but this strong physical body seemed just like the weakest beancurd in the hands of this young man. Every finger could create a hole in it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAccording to the rate of the blood flowing out of your body, you will completely lose all the blood within your body within five minutes. You should be aware of the final fate of an Ancient Void Dragon who has completely exhausted its blood, right?\u201d Xiao Yan indifferently explained the situation.</p><br/><p>Commander Qin coldly trembled after hearing this explanation. The strength of the Ancient Void Dragon was similar to other ancient Magical Beasts. All of their strength originated from their bloodline. If their blood was exhausted, they would become vulnerable. Even if one were able to regain one\u2019s strength in the future, one\u2019s strength would still gradually weaken. This was something that ancient dragon warriors, who desired strength, were unable to endure.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are from the Northern Dragon Island. Who exactly are you? Our Northern Dragon Island has never offended a strong person like you!\u201d Commander Qin inhaled a deep breath of air and finally replied in a hoarse voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the current situation of the Ancient Void Dragon like?\u201d Xiao Yan slowly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt this moment, the ancient dragon tribe has already descended into a civil war. The three great dragon islands have jointly attacked the Eastern Dragon Island. However, it has ended up in a stalemate because a new Dragon Emperor has appeared on the Eastern Dragon Island. Moreover, the Dragon Emperor has summoned back those ancient dragon Elders who were training in the empty realm. Their strength has soared\u2026\u201d Commander Qin hesitated for a moment, but he finally replied honestly after experiencing Xiao Yan\u2019s methods.</p><br/><p>\u201cHas it finally begun\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan frowned slightly and sighed quietly in his heart. Zi Yan was not having an easy time at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is your aim in coming to the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe?\u201d Xiao Yan asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo form an alliance with the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe to deal with the Eastern Dragon Island together.\u201d Commander Qin clenched his teeth as he answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you have abandoned the pride of the Ancient Void Dragons. You are planning on seeking external reinforcement to deal with your internal conflict?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed as he cried out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the decision of the three great dragon kings. It is not something that we can control. Moreover, the matter of the alliance has already been discussed with the Nine Serene Deep Dragon tribe a long time ago. We are only here to receive their reply this time around. Even if you capture us, there will be others who will come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat other reinforcements has the three great dragon kings seeked out other than the Nine Serene Deep Dragon tribe?\u201d Xiao Yan was quiet for a moment before suddenly asking.</p><br/><p>Commander Qin\u2019s body immediately tensed upon hearing this question.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak!\u201d Xiao Yan pressed his finger forward sensing commander Qin tense up. A deep cry was emitted.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have invited\u2026 invited the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe. The Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe has already agreed to lend a hand, but they want the three great dragon kings to agree to capture and hand the new dragon emperor to them!\u201d Commander Qin\u2019s heart felt cold after sensing the desire to kill from Xiao Yan\u2019s voice. He hurriedly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cBastard!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression turned gloomy after those words sounded. He had not expected the three dragon kings to act this shameless. Not only did they break the rules of the tribe and get other tribes involved in an internal conflict but they had even promised to hand the dragon emperor of the tribe to their formal enemies, the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese three bastards\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes were dark and dense. He clearly understood that if the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe and the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python were to form an alliance with the three great dragon islands, Zi Yan\u2019s Eastern Dragon Island would really face imminent danger.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was involuntarily a little absent-minded, and was filled with emotions. Now that they had this route of selling medicinal pills, the matter of being frustrated and distressed over \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 could be considered to have been thrown far behind him.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xun Er, Hu Jia, and Wu Hao were also seated in the large hall. After two days of selling medicinal pills, their medicinal pills had also gained some reputation. Therefore, the current \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 could be considered to have gradually got on track. Therefore, they did not need to personally show their faces during the sale. Instead, they simply just announced a specific selling place and let the members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 wait there. All they needed to do was wait to collect the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 at the end.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s emotional manner, Xun Er laughed softly, \u201cAlthough selling medicinal pills is indeed very lucrative, if we did not have Xiao Yan ge-ge\u2019s speed and success rate in refining medicinal pills, we would also be unable to achieve our current success. I have heard that even with the entire \u2018Medicine Gang\u2019 refining pills, their results after a day was only just a little better than the result of Xiao Yan ge-ge. Let\u2019s not even talk about the material resources first. Just the efforts of those people would have consumed a lot of human resources.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He merely relied on the effects of the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 and the help of Yao Lao by the side. He got up and stretched his lazy waist and began to feel a little bored. He had been refining medicinal pills unceasingly these few days. Now, the reserve medicinal pills that \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 had was sufficient enough for them to sell for a week. Therefore, the current him had more resting time. This caused Xiao Yan, who was used to training, to feel a little uncomfortable. However, he had just broken through to the eight star not long ago. If he were to undertake a retreat again, it might be overkill and would yield poor results.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave the people that we sent out to purchase medicinal ingredients today not return?\u201d Xiao Yan stuffed a cake into his mouth as he asked in a vague voice. The refining these few days had also used up most of the medicinal ingredients that they had purchased earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, but they should be back soon.\u201d Xun Er nodded slightly. However, her words had just sounded when a hurried knocking sounded outside. Immediately, a couple of human figures ran in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is it? Atai?\u201d Xiao Yan asked with some surprise as he saw Atai and the others panting.</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, something happened!\u201d Atai took in a deep breath. After he calmed his harried breathing, he finally spoke with a gloomy expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Xiao Yan frowned slightly. He swallowed the food in his mouth and his voice had also slowly become cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe people who went to purchase medicinal ingredients today have all return empty-handed.\u201d Atai said furiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs expected\u2026 looks like the \u2018Medicine Gang\u2019 has taken action. However, the speed of their retaliation was so fast that it exceeded my expectations.\u201d Xun Er bunched up her eyebrows and spoke coldly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes narrowed. Some cold glints flashed across them.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoreover, the brothers that we had sent out to sell medicinal pills were also blocked by other people. There were even some fiery-tempered brothers who wanted to resist, but were beaten by the other party until they were injured. Now, it is likely that the selling points were already destroyed.\u201d Atai grit his teeth as he spoke of the final matter that caused him to be extremely furious.</p><br/><p>TL: brothers here does not refer to blood brothers. Instead they are people from the same group</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?\u201d The moment these words were spoken, the expressions of the four people in the room immediately became angry. Xiao Yan slammed the table on the spot and stood up. His expression was so dark and cold that it was like the prelude to a great storm.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis \u2018Medicine Gang\u2019 actually dares to be so arrogant? Do they really think that our \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 is fun to bully?\u201d Hu Jia\u2019s pretty face was dark and solemn as she roared angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are not people from the \u2018Medicine Gang.\u2019\u201d Atai shook his head. He clenched his teeth and said, \u201cAccording to the report by our brothers, those people that had come to create trouble appeared to be those fellows from the \u2018White Gang!\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhite Gang\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan was initially startled. A coldness immediately flashed across his face. Xiao Yan said thickly, \u201cThose bastards. They certainly refuse to stop.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChief, what should we do now? We cannot endure this matter!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression was dark and solemn. He sensed the numerous fiery gazes looking at him within the large hall. A long while later, he waved his hand and said in a dark, cold voice, \u201cAtai, go and gather everyone. Follow me to look for the \u2018White Gang!\u2019 Since they want to step on the head of our \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate,\u2019 I must force them to take a beating too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright! Chief, let\u2019s finish them off!\u201d Upon hearing that Xiao Yan did not cower once again, A wave of hot blood and flushed redness swarmed onto Atai\u2019s face. He nodded heavily before dashing out of the pavilion house. After which, everyone heard his loud cries.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, are you planning to fight with the \u2018White Gang\u2019 now?\u201d Xun Er mused for a moment before asking.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s just fight. During this period of time, \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 has received quite a lot of bullying from the \u2018White Gang.\u2019 If we continue to ignore it, it would not only increase their prestige but would also cause the heads of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 to be pointed at and condemned as weak.\u201d A fierceness flashed across Wu Hao\u2019s face as he laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Hao is right. Even if we cannot defeat them, we would also let them know that our \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 isn\u2019t meant to be trifled with!\u201d Hu Jia\u2019s almond eyes glared angrily as she cried out. Her character was originally that of someone who was afraid of nothing. During this period of time, she had held back a lot because she had only just entered the Inner Academy. However, she could not allow the \u2018White Gang\u2019 to provoke and insult them repeatedly in this manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe \u2018White Gang\u2019 has gone overboard this time around. If we still remain silent and do nothing, it would likely cause those injured brothers to become disillusioned.\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s expression carried an angry green color as he nodded. A moment later, he turned toward Xun Er and said, \u201cXun Er, your suggestion of forming or hiring a group to harvest medicine that you proposed the last time might have to be brought forward. With the financial strength of the \u2018Medicine Gang,\u2019 we would have no strength to retaliate if they want to block our path of obtaining medicinal ingredients. Hence, we can only rely on ourselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d Xun Er nodded slightly and said, \u201cI will begin preparing for this tomorrow!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. His expression was dark and cold as he said, \u201cAs for now, everyone will put down everything they are doing and follow me to the \u2018White Gang.\u2019 We will let those bastards in the \u2018White Gang\u2019 know that if they want to step on \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate,\u2019 which is full of thorns, it would be wishful thinking if their feet did not leave behind bloodstains\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>The passersby coming and going on the spacious large road lined with trees eyed the large group of humans with steaming murderous auras. They involuntarily ceased their footsteps with faces filled with stunned looks. Most of this large group of people were holding shining weapons in their hands. The fierce look on their faces caused the people to the side to feel cold.</p><br/><p>Only after they watched this large group of humans disappear from the edge of their sight did the road, which was shocked until it was completely silent, release waves of private whispers.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are these fellows planning to do? Their manner is like they have profound hatred. Are they planning to hack someone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the looks of the badge on their chest, they appear to be members of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate,\u2019 right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUh? The \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 that recently started selling medicinal pills? Don\u2019t tell me that the black-robed young man leading them is that Xiao Yan, who is rumored to have refined those medicinal pills?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the members of the \u2018White Gang\u2019 had made a mess of the \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 selling places. From the looks of it, \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 should be charging toward the \u2018White Gang\u2019 right? Hee hee, this time around, there is great fun to watch\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The calm Inner Academy had become a little noisier because of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate,\u2019 which had suddenly become bloodthirsty. Many students adopted the intention of taking a look at the fun as each of them ran around and told one another. In a short while, it attracted most of the curious people as they swarmed over to where the \u2018White Gang\u2019 was. After all, this kind of large scale great faction battle was extremely rare despite there being quite a lot of fights in the Inner Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cBad news, Chief!\u201d</p><br/><p>The door to a room bursting with unceasing laughter was suddenly pushed open. A human figure rushed in somewhat hastily as he shouted loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the matter that causes you to be so panicked?\u201d Bai Cheng, who was in the leader\u2019s chair, frowned slightly as he spoke unhappily. Yesterday, the \u2018Medicine Gang\u2019 offered a price that caused him to be extremely attracted merely to get him to cause trouble with \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate.\u2019 He originally had great dislike for \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019. How would he not be happy now that there was someone who was willing to pay a hefty price to get them to strike? Therefore, he had promised to undertake it the moment the other party opened its mouth.</p><br/><p>As long as they got the support of the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 of the \u2018Medicine Gang,\u2019 Bai Cheng would be able to exchange it for the scroll of a powerful Dou Technique from the Dou Technique Hall. At that time, his position on the \u2018Strong Ranking\u2019 would likely be able to move up a little. Having his thoughts interrupted by the shouting of someone at this moment naturally caused him to not have a nice expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan has led the members of the \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 to come charging over toward us, the \u2018White Gang!\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Cheng was initially slightly startled when he heard this. An instant later, however, his expression suddenly changed drastically after he recovered. He suddenly stood up and coldly laughed, \u201cIt is really unexpected that this brat has such a bloody character. However, it is like a chicken egg colliding with a rock. He is simply asking for it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Pan\u2019s Gate,\u2019 which does not even have a single \u2018Dou Ling,\u2019 wants to have a big fight with us, the \u2018White Gang?\u2019 Chief, the last time it was because of me that caused us to not be allowed to touch them for half a year. Now that they have come and looked for us by themselves, this bet would naturally be useless!\u201d Fu Ao\u2019s face was flushed red as he stood up and laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>Bai Cheng glanced indifferently at the extremely happy Fu Ao before he coldly laughed, \u201cYou should also not be too careless. It is rumored that that fellow\u2019s fire lotus Dou Technique is something that even Lei Na is no match for. I\u2019m afraid that even in a head on fight, you would be unable to defeat him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu Ao\u2019s face slightly reddened when he heard Bai Cheng\u2019s words. His mouth remained tough as he spoke, \u201cThat kind of Dou Technique may be strong, but it appears that with his strength, using it once a day is perhaps his limit. As long as I can endure one wave, won\u2019t he be like a cluster of soft clay without any resistance, allowing me to mold as I please?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the use of saying this now. Immediately gather our people. Since \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 has come and looked for trouble with great fanfare, our \u2018White Gang\u2019 cannot show even the slightest sign of being timid. Otherwise, how will we survive in the Inner Academy?\u201d Bai Cheng scolded once before he let out a sharp cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone in the room immediately responded in unison upon hearing Bai Cheng\u2019s order. They immediately charged out of the room. They began to shout out loud to gather the members of the gang.</p><br/><p>A cold aura drew over Bai Cheng\u2019s face as he heard the chaotic noisiness outside. He said with a cold smile, \u201cSince you have come looking for us yourself, you should not blame me. This time around, if I do not cause all of you to lose your reputation in the Inner Academy, I would disgrace my ranking on the \u2018Strong Ranking.\u2019 A group of novices who do not know the immensity of the Heavens and the Earth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once he said this, Bai Shan brushed his sleeves. His face contained some cold ridicule as he strode out of the room...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

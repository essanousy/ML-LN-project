In the entire Xiao Clan, the only one who was close to Xun Er was the famous cripple!</p><br/><p>At the edge of the field and surrounded by a huge number of peers, Xiao Ning stared at Xiao Yan with anger emanating from his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bastard, after today, let\u2019s see if you have enough face to be with Xun Er.\u201d With a low curse, Xiao Ning smiled thinking about the misfortune about to befall Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the gazes of envy and anger, Xiao Yan brought Xun Er to the back of the line and started chatting.</p><br/><p>Watching the relaxed Xiao Yan, the people on the platform were all surprising thinking that maybe Xiao Yan didn\u2019t know how this test would change his future\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, he knows he\u2019s going to fail.\u201d The second elder teased.</p><br/><p>The second elder was expecting Xiao Zhan to rage against him but after waiting for quite a while, Xiao Zhan didn\u2019t say anything. In shock, the second elder tilted his head to look at Xiao Zhan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond elder, instead of predictions, you should look at the results. Or else, when the time comes, you\u2019d be throwing away face\u2026\u201d Xiao Zhan gave a deep glance at Xiao Yan who was relaxing under the sun.</p><br/><p>His mouth twitching, the second elder retorted: \u201cHope so. I\u2019m also hoping that he can bring me some surprises.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, it\u2019s time. Let\u2019s start!\u201d The first elder cut both of them off and started the test.</p><br/><p>Xiao Zhan nodded while standing up.Taking a look at the silent training field, he roared: \u201cYou are all new blood of the Xiao Clan and should know the importance of this test. From the test, if you\u2019re above 7 Duan Qi then you\u2019ve made it. However, if you didn\u2019t make it, you can challenge someone that\u2019s about 7 Duan Qi according to the rules. If you win, you will also make it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, now that everyone knows the rules, let\u2019s start the test!\u201d</p><br/><p>With Xiao Zhan\u2019s low roar, the trainees all began to tense up.</p><br/><p>Besides the black monument, the impassive operator stepped up and took out a heavy pamphlet that had all of the names. His cold voice made him seem like the devil to people called out by him.</p><br/><p>Cross legged sitting on the clean and smooth ground. Xiao Yan calmly watched those whose Dou Qi didn\u2019t make the requirement and were crying. Coldly pursing his lips, he didn\u2019t feel any pity for them; he knew from first hand experience that they loved to pick on those that had lower Dou Qi than them, in particular, the \u201ccripple\u201d that was once a genius.</p><br/><p>When they were insulting clansmen that were of lower Dou Qi than themselves, they probably never thought that this day would come.</p><br/><p>The one who humiliates gets humiliated in the end.</p><br/><p>Xun Er sitting next to Xiao Yan also was impassive. Like a lotus that wouldn\u2019t be affected by the mud around it, she slowly twirled her head while sneaking peeks at Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Mei!\u201d</p><br/><p>The operator\u2019s cold voice brought a jump to Xiao Yan brows and his closed eyelids slowly went up.</p><br/><p>Xun Er who was intently watching Xiao Yan from the side curled her nose as she saw Xiao Yan\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>Hmm, she used to be quite close to Xiao Yan ge-ge\u2026. While narrowing her eyes, Xun Er stared at the red clothed girl walking up.</p><br/><p>Soon, Xun Er blinked and tilted her head to look at Xiao Yan\u2019s curved smile, saying: \u201cI\u2019m quite curious about what kind of attitude she\u2019ll have towards Xiao Yan ge-ge after today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders and whispered back:\u201dSome things, once destroyed, will always be destroyed. No matter how much it\u2019s repaired, there will always be an obvious crack. In this clan, there aren\u2019t many people that I approve of\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Xun Er count?\u201d Xun Er\u2019s red mouth made a mischievous smile as she asked Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Taking a strand of Xun Er\u2019s hair and gently slipping it through his finger, Xiao Yan answered: \u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her large eyes curved into beautiful crescent moons while her actual gaze fell upon a blank space. The sight of her was entrancing\u2026</p><br/><p>Back when we were still small, he would sneak into my room and try to help me improve my body. Even though it was such a stupid method that looking back on it, I can\u2019t believe that he would have thought it up, he still continued it for 2 years...</p><br/><p>A smile appeared on her delicate face bringing out two cute dimples. Turning her head, Xun Er thought: In this entire clan, there aren\u2019t many people that Xun Er approves of either, only you\u2026</p><br/><p>From afar, Xiao Ning felt his face twitching when he say the close conversation between Xiao Yan and Xun Er. Jealousy raged in his heart while he resisted the urge to go over there and destroy \u201cperfect\u201d scene.</p><br/><p>\u201cDou Zi Li: 8 Duan!\u201d</p><br/><p>TL: Dou Zi Li, Dou Qi and Dou Zi Qi are all the same thing - Dou Qi</p><br/><p>On the black monument, a bright light was emitted as those words were displayed on it.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Mei: Dou Zi Li, 8 Duan, High level!\u201d Taking a glance at the black monument, the impassive operator slightly nodded while calling out her score.</p><br/><p>Hearing the operator\u2019s voice, Xiao Mei let out a breath as her face became filled with pride. To go from 7 Duan Qi to 8 Duan Qi in just one year was an accomplishment that would net her among the top 5 in her generation. With such an impressive result, it was no wonder that she would be so excited.</p><br/><p>The operator\u2019s voice led a huge disturbance within within the training fields as glances of envy and jealousy fell towards Xiao Mei.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo raise 1 Duan Qi in 1 year, barely decent\u2026\u201d Touching his nose, Xiao Yan calmly evaluated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYup.\u201d Xun Er played with her hair as she carelessly glanced over Xiao Mei who was surrounded by her friends like a princess.</p><br/><p>But after Xiao Mei, out of the dozen or so people, only one person got to 7 Duan Qi. The rest were all eliminated.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Xun Er!\u201d</p><br/><p>The impassive operator, surprisingly, had a bit of emotion when he called this name.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gaze fell upon Xun Er who was sitting next to Xiao Yan as they heard that name.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, don\u2019t be too surprised later\u2026\u201d Standing up, Xun Er bent down to mischievously smile at Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>His brows twitching, Xiao Yan watched the beautiful backline of Xun Er as he muttered: \u201cDid she become a Dou Zhe?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

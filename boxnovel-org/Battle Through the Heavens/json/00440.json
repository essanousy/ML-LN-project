Only at this moment did they realize what had happened in this sudden turn of events. These fellows were actually snatching the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 from the older students?</p><br/><p>The corner of their mouths twitched a couple of times. These five unlucky new students, who were robbed by the blue-clothed young man\u2019s group earlier, saw that Xiao Yan\u2019s group actually rudely knocked out the five Inner Academy older students after snatching their \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019 Their expressions were extremely brilliant. Not that long ago, they exchanged blows with this group of older students. However, after merely just a few exchanges, they were completely defeated by these strong older students who had a wealth of battle experience. However, now\u2026 The group of older students, who had been swaggering triumphantly after their previous victory, had ended up in a miserable state, similar to their own, within just two to three minutes of fighting with Xiao Yan\u2019s group. This huge gap really caused these students to feel a little dull.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey are indeed worthy of being the top five ranked people of the Qualifying Competition. Their strength is actually this great.\u201d As the new students being hunted this time around, they naturally knew Xiao Yan\u2019s five man group. However, they still did not expect that when these five people gathered together, they were actually able to defeat the older students within the Inner Academy. This group was really strong.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, it is really expected that the Inner Academy is actually this unique. It really did not betray my expectations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Jia played with the Fire Crystal Card in her hand, and glanced at the five Inner Academy students, who had been forcefully beaten until they fainted, and tied to a tree trunk by Xiao Yan. She laughed in a lovely voice. Earlier, she had obtained eighteen days worth of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 from the older student she had just interrogated. Therefore, the number on her Fire Crystal Card had already turned from five to twenty-three.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow unfortunate. We are actually unable to snatch away all the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 in their hands and must leave a seven day minimum of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019.\u201d Hu Jia was a little regretful as she looked at the crystal card in her hand and muttered.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like the \u2018Sky Flame Qi Training Tower\u2019 in the Inner Academy should be the reason why the students of the Inner Academy are able to train this quickly. It is really astonishing.\u201d Xun Er gently smiled and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed beyond my expectations.\u201d Wu Hao slowly nodded and continued, \u201cHowever, if we were to compare, I am more interested in that so-called \u2018Strong Ranking.\u2019 I will find an opportunity to challenge them after we enter the Inner Academy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head when he heard the heated fighting spirit hidden in Wu Hao\u2019s words. This person was too crazy about fighting.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should we do next?\u201d Bai Shan\u2019s usually ice-cold expression also had a rare smile at this moment. The reason was something that everyone naturally understood; the twenty days of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 that he had plundered from the unfortunate fellow\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze swept over the faces of the five older students, who had been knocked out. After ensuring that they did not have any reaction, he raised his head and took out the extremely crude route map from his storage ring. After looking at it for a long while, he finally pointed at a certain spot with some hesitation and said, \u201cThe size of this forest is extremely large. Our current position should be around here. If we continue walking along this path, we might be able to walk out of this forest within a day\u2019s time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hurry. Don\u2019t waste any more time.\u201d Bai Shan hurriedly urged when he heard this.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan looked at him, but did not move. The dark, black, crystal sheet was swiftly rotated between his fingers. His black eyes flashed slightly. A moment later, he moved his finger and clipped the crystal card precisely between his fingers. With a smile, he said, \u201cEveryone, since you all already know about the importance of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 within the Inner Accademy, do all of you want to take this chance to obtain a little more?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want more? I earnestly wish to be able to obtain enough \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 to be able to train in the \u2018Sky Flame Qi Training Tower\u2019 for a whole year.\u201d Hu Jia curled her lip and replied. The others also nodded a little. From the mouths of the few older students, they had also clearly understood just how important and necessary the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 was for those within the Inner Academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, are you all willing to take a risk for the possibility to obtain more \u2018Fire Energy?\u2019\u201d Xiao Yan smiled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d Bai Shan frowned slightly. His eyebrows twitched as he said in surprise, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you are targeting other groups of older student?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince they can snatch ours, why can\u2019t we snatch theirs?\u201d Xiao Yan smiled faintly and continued, \u201cMoreover, if we were to look at it in terms of strength, with the exception of the two so-called \u2018Black White Evil Stopper\u2019 groups, any of the individual remaining groups would be unable to contend with us so long as we don\u2019t let them join forces and attack us. This is our opportunity! What do you say? Do you dare to give it a try?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hu Jia, Wu Hao, and Bai Shan fell into silence when they heard these words from Xiao Yan. Xun Er gently laughed and still stood by Xiao Yan\u2019s side, using her actions to express her choice.</p><br/><p>The silence continued for a moment. Wu Hao was the first to nod his head as he replied in a deep voice, \u201cThere is only reward if there is risk. As long as you dare to do it, I will not cower even a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, crazy fellow. Alright, alright, who asked me to also greatly lust for \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019\u201d Hu Jia spread her hands and spoke helplessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I have no objections either.\u201d Seeing that everyone had agreed, Bai Shan glanced at the Crystal Card in his hand once again before clenching his teeth and saying, \u201cI\u2019ll go all out.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, since everyone has agreed, then this will be our course of direction for now.\u201d Xiao Yan clapped his hands and smiled. He immediately hesitated a little before saying in a deep voice, \u201cHowever, before we begin, I will say this first. Should we not first decide how we should distribute the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 should we once again successfully obtain it from another group? I don\u2019t want a situation where the group breaks apart as a result of unequal distribution.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Shan and the others were startled when they heard this. They immediately nodded. If this problem was not properly resolved, it might really result in the group breaking apart. Should the group break apart in this kind of place, any single person among them would unlikely be able to rely on his own strength to successfully walk out of the forest. What one needed in this forest was teamwork and not the courage of one person!</p><br/><p>\u201cDistribute it equally. If there is an instance where there is an unequal distribution, we will compensate him first the next time. What do all of you say?\u201d Xun Er mused for a moment before opening her mouth to speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no objections.\u201d Hu Jia and Wu Hao nodded their heads. Soon after, Bai Shan also nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince this is the case, then let\u2019s act according to this distribution pattern.\u201d Xiao Yan sighed in relief within his heart. He saw that their most realistic problem, which was also the one that was the easiest to break apart the group, had been settled so easily. He turned his body around to glance at the five new students, whose faces were covered in bruises, not far away. He waved his hand and threw over a few jade bottles. \u201cThese are healing medicine. They will help reduce your external wounds.\u201d</p><br/><p>The new students scrambled to catch the healing medicine that Xiao Yan had thrown over. They were stunned. A warm feeling flowed through their hearts as they nodded heavily toward Xiao Yan. Their eyes were filled with a kind of gratitude.</p><br/><p>Sending charcoal in the snow is forever an action that would easily capture people\u2019s hearts.</p><br/><p>TL; Sending charcoal in the snow - Giving people what they need the most when they are in trouble</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan randomly waved his hand and called toward Hu Jia and the other three. Immediately, five human figures dashed into the thicket, and swiftly disappeared.</p><br/><p>Now, the hunted began to look for the hunters to attack!</p><br/><p>There were two old men seated cross-legged on top of a huge tree within the forest. Their bodies did not move even a little. The gentle breeze blew over them, but the clothes on their bodies were like steel and did not even shift, appearing extremely strange.</p><br/><p>At a certain moment, the two old men, who had their eyes shut, suddenly opened their eyes. They looked at each other and saw a hint of shock and laughter within each other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, good, good\u2026. the new students this year are much more interesting than those of the previous years.\u201d A gray-robed old man was the first to open his mouth as he spoke with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose five little fellows should be the top five ranked of this year\u2019s Qualifying Competition, right? Their strengths are all quite good and their potentials are extraordinary. No wonder they are able to even beat senior student groups from the Inner Academy.\u201d The other blue-robed old man nodded and praised.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat little fellow leading them seems to be called Xiao Yan, right? He is quite bold. I like him.\u201d The gray-robed old man fondled his beard as he spoke with a smile. Hearing the conversation, it appeared as though they had witnessed all of the actions of Xiao Yan\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, he is indeed quite good. Originally, that group was not harmonious but this little fellow integrated them together. The top five students in the Qualifying Competition of the previous years were all filled with haughtiness and none of them would submit to each other. Finally, they were separated and defeated by the older student groups from the Inner Academy. This time though, this group just might be able to exceed people's expectations.\u201d The blue-robed old man laughed as he replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, we are also unable to conclude results now. The \u2018Black White Evil Stopper\u2019 this year is a group of fellows that has come running out from the battle arena. Their strength is not something that an ordinary group can compare with. If that group of Xiao Yan\u2019s were to meet them, it is difficult to say just who would win and who would lose.\u201d The gray-robed old man said with interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, all of those fellows have experienced hundreds of battles. They are extremely rich in battle experience and the teamwork and cooperation that exists between them is at a very high level. If Xiao Yan\u2019s group were to meet them, it is likely they will have a tough battle. However, I really like the exchanges between the strong.\u201d The blue-robed old man let loose a soft laugh, which actually contained some anticipation within it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that we are not going to be so bored in the near future. Let\u2019s wait to see a good show.\u201d The two old men faced each other and laughed softly. Immediately, they once again slowly shut their eyes.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Five human figures slowly walked over a pile of withered leaves within the dense forest. As their feet stepped on the withered leaves, they emitted a soft \u2018sha sha\u2019 sound. All of these five people wore a tower-shaped badge on their chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we too unlucky? Since we entered the forest, we haven\u2019t met a single group of new students? If this continues, we won\u2019t even be able to recoup the capital we used to participate in the Hunting Competition!\u201d A young man, among the five people, suddenly could not resist cursing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t create so much noise. Let\u2019s continue looking. There are a total of fifty new students, why are you so anxious?\u201d That man, who was leading the group, frowned as he scolded the young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou five, are you looking for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>When the man leading the group was scolding, a soft laughter suddenly sounded not far in front of them. The five older students from the Inner Academy were surprised. They hurriedly raised their heads, and were stunned to discover that not far away from them, a group, consisting of three males and two females, were smiling as they watched them.</p><br/><p>\u201cCapture them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The shock on the face of the man leading the group was gradually replaced with a wild joy. He let out a hurried cry and the five men suddenly went over and surrounded the newcomers.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe old rules. One on one. We will collectively distribute the gains once we get our hands on the Crystal Cards.\u201d Seeing that the five people had actually taken the initiative to charge forward, the smile on the black-robed young man\u2019s face grew much richer. He turned his head to the four people behind him and smiled as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince we are clear, then\u2026 let\u2019s attack. For our \u2018Fire Energy!\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-robed young man smiled. Immediately, five powerful auras of Dou Qi suddenly erupted from within the dense forest.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

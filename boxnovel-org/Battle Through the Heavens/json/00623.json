Strangely, however, it did not scatter down, but instead solidified in mid-air. That manner was as though it was like the sky was flooded with fresh blood, appearing extremely eye-catching.</p><br/><p>The entire plaza was deadly silent. Everyone was stunned as they looked at the sudden change of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019. After two years, the new students who had entered the Inner Academy were mostly unaware of the earth-shaking great battle that had erupted in the Inner Academy back then. Hence, it was the first time they had seen any change in the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019!</p><br/><p>The stunned looks continued for an instant before they were suddenly awaken by the wild joyous cry that resounded throughout the sky. Everyone who had yet to recover blinked their eyes while feeling at a loss. Xiao Yan? This name\u2026 seemed a little familiar.</p><br/><p>Of course, this name might be only familiar to ordinary students, but it was unforgettable to some people. Immediately, numerous shocked gazes carried disbelief as they turned toward the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019!</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao\u2026 Xiao Yan? This fellow is still alive? He is really still alive! This voice cannot be wrong! Cannot be wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Hao\u2019s usual stern face was covered with an unrestrained joy at this moment. His gaze stared intently at the bright-red magma pillar which had erupted from the top of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019. His voice had become somewhat hoarse in his excitement.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yu by the side was biting her lower lip with the back of her teeth. Her lovely body shook gently. Some moisture even surged into her eyes in her excitement. He was still alive? He was really still alive!</p><br/><p>Not only were the Elders on the tall platform affected, but even the indifferent faced First Elder Su Qian was also using a stunned gaze to look at the magma pillar that shot directly to the sky. A moment later, he finally said, somewhat absent-minded, \u201cThe voice just now\u2026 it appears to be Xiao Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder, it\u2019s Xiao Yan! There\u2019s no mistake. I said that that fellow will definitely not die! Ha ha!\u201d Lin Yan\u2019s face turned bright-red in his excitement. For some unknown reason, he held a confidence for that fellow which was difficult for an ordinary person to understand. Even though Xiao Yan was swallowed by the \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, and was dragged into the endless underground, he firmly believed that the strong stubborn fellow would definitely climb out once again!</p><br/><p>Although this absolute confidence was a somewhat pedantic stubborness, he still believed it! Moreover, he did it without the slightest reason.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is good that he didn\u2019t die. It is good that he didn\u2019t die\u2026\u201d First Elder laughed. Although his face appeared calm, his tone also revealed shock and excitement in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow\u2026 really cannot be predicted with common sense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Xiuya and Liu Qing exchanged glances before smiling with a sigh. It was fortunate that they had remained behind back then. Otherwise, they would not be able to see this shocking scene today.</p><br/><p>Under the many gazes that were filled with different emotions, the magma pillar that had erupted out from the top of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 suddenly coagulated and immediately broke apart in the air. A human figure slowly appeared in front of everyone\u2019s gazes after the magma pillar broke apart automatically.</p><br/><p>The person who was at the spot where the magma was had a tall frame and was wearing a black robe. This, accompanied by the warm smile that hung on his delicate and handsome face, gave him a uniquely handsome look. Everyone was slightly startled when they saw the young man walking out from the magma without the slightest injury. Immediately after that, they suddenly appeared to have recalled something. All the gazes suddenly turned toward the sculpture in front of the entrance of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019. Numerous sounds of people inhaling cold air appeared one after another in the plaza. Now, they had finally recalled who exactly the so-called Xiao Yan was\u2026</p><br/><p>The black-robed young man was suspended in the sky. His gaze slowly swept over the large crowd below before eventually seeing some familiar faces. A smile was lifted from the corner of his mouth as he laughed in a clear and loud manner, \u201cKe ke, everyone, Xiao Yan is back. Do you welcome me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fellow, it is really unexpected that we can meet again.\u201d A smile involuntarily surfaced on Su Qian\u2019s face as he laughed out loud after hearing that clear laughter of the young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter not seeing you for so long, First Elder is becoming stronger with age.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled. He waved his sleeves and the bright-red magma all over the sky strangely rushed back and was returned to the magma pillar. Immediately, the enormous magma pillar suddenly followed the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 as it smashed down in front of a countless number of shocked gazes. That great momentum caused one\u2019s mind to tremble. Their gazes were all filled with a much denser respect the next time they looked at Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>He had actually forced back such an enormous magma pillar by simply raising his hand. This posture of the strong caused a fiery heat to rise in the eyes of many students. This was the realm they were pursuing!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s toes pressed on the air after expelling all the magma. A faint silver glow appeared, and his body flashed and appeared on the tall platform in a ghost-like manner.</p><br/><p>Everyone on the tall platform knit their brows slightly when they saw this ghost-like speed of Xiao Yan. Clearly, the current Xiao Yan seemed to be much stronger than he was in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve advanced to the Dou Wang class?\u201d A glint flickered passed Su Qian\u2019s eyes as he laughed. He knew that Xiao Yan\u2019s true strength in the past was at the very most at the Dou Ling class. Although he was eventually able to fight with an expert Dou Huang like Han Feng, the former, given his eyesight, naturally understood that the strength did not truly belong to Xiao Yan. Now, however, he could clearly sense that Xiao Yan was really using his own strength when displaying his speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d Xiao Yan rubbed his head. He was also not very certain. This time around, his breakthrough was achieved in an unconscious state. Hence, he was not very clear just what class he was currently in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you let Lin Xiuya try?\u201d Su Qian laughed. He was also quite curious about just what level this fellow had reached, who always caused people to witness a miracle, after not seeing him for two years.</p><br/><p>\u201cI could not wish for more. Back then, I had ultimately not sparred with him.\u201d Xiao Yan laughed softly. His gaze was thrown toward the eager face of Lin Xiuya behind Su Qian.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot having exchanged blows with you has always been my regret. It is best that I make up for it today.\u201d Lin Xiuya smiled. His toes pressed on the rock platform, and his body rushed down before eventually appearing on an empty piece of land in the plaza. After which, he raised his head and looked at Xiao Yan with eager eyes.</p><br/><p>The conversation between Su Qian and the rest had not been suppressed. Hence, everyone\u2019s faces had immediately become excited when they saw Lin Xiuya stepping down from the platform. With a flapping sound, all of them surrounded the place until nothing could pass. There was hardly anyone who did not know of Lin Xiuya\u2019s reputation. The founder of \u2018Wolf Teeth\u2019. Although he was currently no longer involved in the matters of \u2018Wolf Teeth\u2019, \u2018Wolf Teeth\u2019 still stood as a top tier faction within the Inner Academy by relying on his reputation. There was seldom anyone who dared to offend them.</p><br/><p>Of course, most of the thoughts people were having were about witnessing Xiao Yan\u2019s true strength. During these years, Xiao Yan\u2019s name had already become a legend within the Inner Academy. Although many people verbally passed on the earth-shaking battle back then, some of the new students could not help but form doubt in their hearts after hearing a lot about it as time passed on. A student who was of similar age as them back then was actually able to defeat an expert Dou Huang after having only arrived for one year? Was this not too great of an exaggeration?</p><br/><p>Hence, they were naturally extremely happy and wanted to experience an eye-opening battle. Especially now that they had witnessed Xiao Yan appearing, and was already about to spar with an expert like Lin Xiuya the moment he did so.</p><br/><p>Although Lin Xiuya had already become an Elder, he still possessed quite a great reputation among the students these few years. His great strength also caused some of the thorn-like students to be afraid of offending him. Therefore, many students felt that he was the right choice to be Xiao Yan\u2019s opponent.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also involuntarily shook his head as he watched the black mass of human crowd below. Was the activity in this place not a little too large?</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fellow, currently, the Inner Academy is even more competitive than two years ago. There are a countless number of thorny students. You don\u2019t want your status as a Senior to be doubted by these little fellows right?\u201d Su Qian smiled and spoke. His attempt to get Xiao Yan and Lin Xiuya to spar in public was to help raise Xiao Yan\u2019s reputation. There were currently too many new students. People from the past tend to be easily forgotten.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo years? I didn\u2019t expect that two years had actually passed by with a glance\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan was stunned and he involuntarily sighed sobbingly. He immediately nodded and his body flashed. The next time he appeared, he was shockingly already standing in front of Lin Xiuya.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, you are the leader of our \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 so you better not lose our face. Currently, all the brothers in \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 are watching you, our leader who has been missing for two years!\u201d Xiao Yan had just stabilized his body when a loud laugh suddenly sounded from outside the battleground. He was startled before following the voice to take a look. There was a large group of black mass on a tall platform outside the plaza. The few leaders of this large group were surprisingly Wu Hao, Hu Jia, Zi Yan, and\u2026 Xiao Yu huh?</p><br/><p>A large group of people with heated gazes were behind these few people. At this moment, their gazes were searing hot as they watched the black-robed young man in the battleground. At the time they joined \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 they had heard quite a number of people describing the stories when \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 was founded and their founder. Hence, this Xiao Yan, whom they had never seen before, had a majestic position within their hearts.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will catch up with all of you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled toward Wu Hao and the others before slowly turning toward Lin Xiuya who was looking at him solemnly. The other party\u2019s eyes were filled with an unusually intense fear. This kind of expression had appeared in Xiao Yan in the past. Now, its position had changed.</p><br/><p>Su Qian smiled on the high platform as he looked at the two who were facing each other. He asked, \u201cHow many exchanges do you think Lin Xiuya will be able to endure in Xiao Yan\u2019s hands?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was startled when they heard this. It was a long while later before an Elder softly inquired, \u201cIs First Elder referring to the precondition that Xiao Yan had used all the things to raise his strength?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis own strength.\u201d Su Qian shook his head slightly and softly spoke, \u201cI guess that it won\u2019t exceed three exchanges.\u201d</p><br/><p>All the Elders were startled. It was a long while later before that Elder laughed dryly, \u201cLin Xiuya is currently a five star Dou Wang. It would be somewhat difficult to defeat him within three rounds even if it was an ordinary Dou Huang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian simply smiled without speaking. Although Xiao Yan\u2019s aura was somewhat strange making it difficult for even him to sense the former\u2019s strength, he was still able to vaguely sense that Xiao Yan\u2019s current strength should be somewhat terrifying\u2026</p><br/><p>While everyone heads swarmed to focus on the ground, Xiao Yan was clenching his fist tightly and sensing the surging strength within his body. He laughed softly, \u201cShall we begin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Xiuya nodded his head. A ferocious aura that only an expert of the Dou Wang class surged out from within Lin Xiuya\u2019s body. Two years had already allowed him to truly enter into the Dou Wang class, and had even allowed him to climb increasingly higher within it. With his current strength, he could be considered around the upper-middle level even among the Elders!</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>A dark-green Dou Qi surged out from Lin Xiuya\u2019s body. He clenched his fist and a longsword that was completely agglomerated from wind affinity energy surfaced. The longsword was swung randomly and a wind blade shot out from it, cutting a scar on the hard black rock.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head when he saw that Lin Xiuya was nearly completely armed. A silver glow was faintly visible under his feet as a slight thundering roar quietly sounded. Xiao Yan\u2019s entire body trembled the moment the rumbling thunder appeared!</p><br/><p>Lin Xiuya\u2019s solemn expression immediately changed just as Xiao Yan\u2019s body trembled. He immediately pierced the longsword violently toward his back amid the numerous stunned gazes from around him.</p><br/><p>The sword that contained a ferocious wind was pierced toward the the air but the place was empty. Such a situation caused all the pores on Lin Xiuya\u2019s body to tense up. He had clearly sensed Xiao Yan\u2019s aura appearing behind him...</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen has this fellow\u2019s speed become so frightening?\u201d</p><br/><p>A thought rotated in a lightning-like manner within his heart. Although Xiao Yan\u2019s speed was swift and fierce in the past, there was at least some traces to follow. Now, however, he seemed intangible and was difficult to sense.</p><br/><p>Lin Xiuya\u2019s gaze swiftly shifted in all directions. His eyes suddenly shrank as the energy longsword faced his front and pierced forward fiercely!</p><br/><p>The surrounding students were completely at a loss as this sudden random piercing by Lin Xiuya. Was Xiao Yan not standing at the original spot without moving? Why did Lin Xiuya act in such a crazy manner all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>The eyesight of an ordinary students naturally could not see the mystery behind his actions. Only those who were strong could vaguely discover that Xiao Yan\u2019s figure which remained at the original spot seemed to be somewhat illusory. Some of those who were sensitive immediately came to a sudden understanding within their hearts. It was actually an afterimage?</p><br/><p>Just what kind of strange, unpredictable agility and speed did one need to be able to leave an afterimage in such a quiet fashion?</p><br/><p>A cluster of dark-green flames suddenly appeared when the longsword that had pierced forward fiercely reached a certain part of the air. When the longsword was pierced into the cluster of flame, everyone could clearly see that the longsword which was agglomerated from energy, did not even struggle much before it was completely incinerated into nothingness by the dark-green flame.</p><br/><p>The moment the longsword turned into nothingness, a black figure suddenly appeared in front of everyone\u2019s stunned gazes as though it had teleported.</p><br/><p>The black-robed young man smiled at Lin Xiuya. His hand which contained the dark-green flame was suddenly extended out explosively and directly grabbed toward the latter\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlade web!\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Xiuya displayed his extraordinary fighting experience at this critical moment. He formed a seal in his hand and the energy in front of him rippled swiftly. Finally, it agglomerated into a dark-green energy web.</p><br/><p>However, Xiao Yan\u2019s hand did not pause even a little when faced with this energy web which was covered with tiny wind blades. His hand continued to extend in an extremely direct fashion. Being burned by that dark-green flame, the sharp wind blade web immediately became like weak thin paper as it tore through it\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s hand passed through the blade web without any resistance and slowly came to a stop when it was merely half an inch from Lin Xiuya\u2019 neck.</p><br/><p>The entire place was silent!</p><br/><p>Everyone watched Lin Xiuya who did not dare to make the slightest move under Xiao Yan\u2019s hand which was covered by that dark-green flame. Shock quietly climbed onto their faces.</p><br/><p>One move!</p><br/><p>A five star expert Dou Wang had actually\u2026 merely lasted for one extremely simple move in Xiao Yan\u2019s hand!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

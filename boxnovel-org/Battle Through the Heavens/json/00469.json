Among this crowd, there were two groups of people who were facing off as they looked at each other in a covetous manner. One group had more people, while the other only had a little more than ten people. However, the situation in the place appeared to be one where the smaller group held the advantage.</p><br/><p>\u201cXun Er, Hu Jia, don\u2019t be stubborn. I have already said that this \u2018Pan Gate\u2019 of yours would definitely not be able to rise within the Inner Academy. The new students are essential new blood of the numerous factions in the Inner Academy each year. It is impossible for the factions to sit and watch you hold all the new blood in your hands.\u201d The one leading the smaller group was a young man wearing white clothes. His handsome appearance was such that it was extremely easy for him to attract a favorable impression from women. However, Xun Er and Hu Jia on the opposite side did not display the slightest favorable impression because of it. Instead, they did not hide their expressions of disgust and disdain.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is our matter, there is no need for you, a person who abandons his companions, to worry about it.\u201d Hu Jia laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t have any other matters to deal with, please leave. Our new students\u2019 residency does not welcome you here.\u201d Xun Er glanced at Bai Shan before she spoke indifferently.</p><br/><p>The attitude of these two people caused the corner of Bai Shan\u2019s mouth to twitch involuntarily. His face, which was originally filled with smiles, had also become a lot darker and colder.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Shan, why do you need to say such nonsense. Directly attack and crush their haughtiness. At that time, there will naturally be people who would choose to follow us and leave.\u201d Laughter was suddenly emitted from a young man with a strong build by Bai Shan\u2019s side. When this man spoke, his eyes would occasionally sweep over the graceful curves of Xun Er\u2019s and Hu Jia\u2019s lovely body.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, Brother Fu Ao is right. However, the opposite side are girls. If we were to fight just after we come, it is unavoidable that others would say that we don\u2019t have magnanimity, no?\u201d Bai Shan did not dare ignore that young man. The latter was one of the three strong Dou Lings within his gang, other than his cousin brother. Therefore, he hurriedly replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, you are right.\u201d Fu Ao laughed when he heard Bai Shan speak in this manner. His gaze once again turned toward Xun Er and he smiled as he said, \u201cJunior Xun Er, that Xiao Yan may be powerful enough to be able to lead you all to victory in the \u2018Fire Energy Hunting Competition.\u2019 Unfortunately, he does not have the qualifications within the Inner Academy. You can also stop having delusional thoughts about his courage and resolution. Maybe in a day or two, after he has suffered greatly, he himself will disband this \u2018Pan Gate\u2019 of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to worry about that. As long as Xiao Yan ge-ge has not opened his mouth, this \u2018Pan Gate\u2019 will not be afraid of any faction. You can try if you want to forcefully disband us!\u201d Xun Er looked at him while speaking in a cold voice.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xun Er, whose elegant and exquisite face covered with frost, the smile on Fu Ao\u2019s face became even richer. He clicked his tongue and said, \u201cWhat a stubborn girl. However, it is really to my liking\u2026 what about this, on account of your face, as long as you hand over five new students today, my \u2018White Gang\u2019 will not come and find trouble with you in the future. What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Fu, five\u2026\u201d Hearing this, the expression of Bai Shan at the side changed and he hurriedly opened his mouth. The purpose of him bringing people here was not merely to have five new students.</p><br/><p>Fu Ao waved his hand and interrupted Bai Shan\u2019s words. He smiled as he eyed Xun Er and said, \u201cOf course, Junior Xun Er must be one of these five people.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Shan\u2019s face could not help but sink when these words of Fu Ao fell. He was currently able to hear that this fellow actually had some intentions toward Xun Er. A fleeting coldness flashed across his eyes.</p><br/><p>As Fu Ao\u2019s gaze was staring intently at Xun Er, he did not see Bai Shan\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2018Pan Gate\u2019 will not hand over a single person to any faction!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er had naturally heard how Fu Ao had taken liberties within his herds. Her intelligent pupils stared at the former. A long while later, the frostiness on her face suddenly disappeared completely as she said in a calm voice.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xun Er, who had once again become indifferent, Fu Ao frowned a little. He did not like women displaying such an expression. Immediately, the smile on his face was also gradually withdrawn. He said coldly, \u201cSince that is the case, looks like I can only use force. I want to see just what credibility you have to retain them after I defeat the strong people in this \u2018Pan Gate\u2019 of yours.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen you want to try?\u201d Hu Jia\u2019s pretty face was ice-cold. Emerald Dou Qi surged from within her body. A strong force spread over this empty ground.</p><br/><p>As Hu Jia\u2019s force erupted, the dozens of new students behind her also roared angrily. Numerous different colored Dou Qis swarmed out at the same time. All of a suddenly, the leaves on the ground were shaken by the Dou Qi until they were lifted into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? This batch of new students is indeed as the rumors said. They are boundlessly arrogant\u2026\u201d Fu Ao could not help but give a smile of ridicule when he saw the numerous Dou Qi surfacing. He stomped his footsteps heavily. One could only hear a deep banging sound when a blue-colored Dou Qi instantly covered his body. As the Dou Qi rolled, it appeared as viscous as seawater while it rolled all over his body.</p><br/><p>As Fu Ao\u2019s Dou Qi swarmed out, a powerful force that was more than a few times stronger than anyone else present began to spread out over the empty ground. He actually relied on just his strength to suppress the force of numerous new students.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday, I want to let you see the difference between the older students and the younger ones!\u201d Fu Ao stuck out his loin and laughed coldly, \u201cBai Shan, bring the people and let these new students understand that merely having tough bones will not help them to survive!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Shan nodded slightly. His eyes watched Xun Er on the opposite side in a complicated manner. After which, he waved his hand and commanded in a deep voice, \u201cAttack!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Bai Shan\u2019s cry, the nearly ten older students behind him immediately let out a soft cry. Their bodies turned into shadows as they shot explosively toward the large group in a lightning-like manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will block Bai Shan. Xun Er, you lead the others to stop those remaining.\u201d Hu Jia shook her delicate hand. A long, green-colored whip appeared. The whip lashed slightly and a thunderclap sound was emitted in the air. It also faintly carried an unusual fragrance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xun Er nodded slightly. Her pupils were icy-cold as she watched the human figures shooting over explosively. A dazzling golden glow surfaced on her small jade-like hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the fight was about to begin, and Bai Shan\u2019s group was about to clash with Xun Er\u2019s group, a black shadow suddenly cut through the sky, immediately carrying the sharp sound of tearing the air. The shadow suddenly shot to a spot between both parties. Immediately, an explosion accompanied by spreading dust isolated both sides.</p><br/><p>Fu Ao\u2019s brows furrowed slightly as he eyed the dust-filled region. He waved his sleeves and a breeze that carried some moisture suddenly appeared. It blew over immediately, wetting the dust and causing it to fall.</p><br/><p>As the dust fell to the ground, an enormous black-colored ruler, that was inserted into the hard rocky ground, appeared in the eyes of Fu Ao and the others...</p><br/><p>After their gazes paused for a moment on the black ruler, everyone turned toward the two people who stood behind it.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, Wu Hao, I thought that both of you had run away after hearing some news. It is really unexpected that you dare to return.\u201d Bai Shan\u2019s expression changed slightly as he coldly spoke after seeing the two human figures who had appeared.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze coldly glanced at him. After which, it jumped passed him and stopped on Fu Ao\u2019s body. He could sense that this fellow was the strongest person present.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan and Wu Hao appearance, the new students of \u2018Pan Gate\u2019 immediately cheered. After all the things that had happened during this period of time, Xiao Yan had already become the true backbone in their hearts. As long as he was around, they would have the fighting spirit necessary to fight with anyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe two of you have finally returned\u2026\u201d Hu Jia quietly sighed in relief when she saw that skinny back in front of her. No matter how sturdy her heart was, it was ultimately the best for a man to stand in front when it came to such matters.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge. They\u2026\u201d Xun Er\u2019s gaze paused on Xiao Yan\u2019s back as she spoke softly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved his hand and interrupted Xun Er\u2019s words. He said with a faint smile, \u201cYes, I know. Leave the remaining matters to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er nodded in a gentle and soft manner as she gazed at that skinny back. She liked his manner of being filled with confidence no matter what he did, just like when he was young.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are Xiao Yan?\u201d Fu Ao stared at Xiao Yan, then glanced at Xun Er\u2019s gentleness which was completely different from her coldness earlier. He could not help but knit his eyebrows together and speak with a cold smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is Xiao Yan. The current leader of these new students.\u201d Bai Shan interrupted and informed him.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Shan, it really is unexpected that the skin on that face of yours is actually thick to such a degree. My eyes were really dull in the past.\u201d Xiao Yan glanced at Bai Shan and laughed as he spoke. There was a ridicule that he could not hide in his laughter.</p><br/><p>Being mocked in such a matter, a greenness involuntarily surfaced on Bai Shan\u2019s face. He gloomily glanced at Xiao Yan and coldly said, \u201cYou can be arrogant. I have already said that in the Inner Academy, I have many ways of dealing with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than relying on other people\u2019s power, what else can you do?\u201d Xiao Yan laughed indifferently.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright stop arguing.\u201d Fu Ao waved his hands and interrupted the two of them as they mocked one another. He raised his head, eyed Xiao Yan and said calmly, \u201cI shall not argue with you. Hand over fifteen new students to us, the \u2018White Gang\u2019 and we will immediately leave this place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd if I don\u2019t hand any over?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s hand was placed on the hilt of the ruler in front of him as he asked with a cold laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I will beat you up until your prestige is completely lost in front of these new students!\u201d Fu Ao parted his mouth and laughed. His dense white teeth emitted a coldness.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded slightly. He twisted his neck and had just took a step forward when Wu Hao, who stood beside him suddenly extended his hand to stop him. The latter asked, \u201cLet me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fellow is a Dou Ling. It may be a little difficult for you to handle now.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. He pushed Wu Hao\u2019s hand away and slowly took a step forward. His gaze paused on Fu Ao\u2019s body and laughed softly, \u201cOne on one. If you win, we will do as you say. If you lose, your \u2018White Gang\u2019 is not allowed to find trouble with our \u2018Pan Gate\u2019 within three months. How about it? Do you dare to accept?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu Ao\u2019s eyes immediately narrowed when he heard this.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Fu. Don\u2019t agree with him. That fellow possesses some powerful trump cards. When he uses them, it is sufficient to easily contend with a Dou Ling. The last time, even Luo Hou was defeated by his hands.\u201d Bai Shan to the side hurriedly continued, \u201cAll of us can attack together. Although there are many new students, they will definitely not be able to block us all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need. That Luo Hou is but someone who just entered the Dou Ling class. Defeating him is nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fu Ao waved his hands. His gaze stared intently at Xiao Yan. Immediately, it turned toward Xun Er behind as he parted his mouth and laughed, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we change the stakes. If I win, hand over fifteen people to the \u2018White Gang\u2019 with her among them. If I lose, the \u2018White Gang\u2019 will not find trouble with all of you for half a year? What do you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile on Xiao Yan\u2019s face gradually withdrew until his dark and solemn appearance a moment later had some ferocity hidden within it. A dragon had scales which could not be touched. Those who did so would incur its wrath. Xiao Yan\u2019s untouchable scale was undoubtedly this girl who had placed all her thoughts on him from when they were young...</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, compete!\u201d</p><br/><p>A gentle voice suddenly sounded from behind Xiao Yan. Immediately, a soft seemingly boneless delicate hand gently held Xiao Yan tightly clenched fist.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan inhaled a deep breath of air. He turned his head and eyed the green-clothed young lady who was smiling elegantly. Tilting his body slightly, he moved closer to the young lady\u2019s ears under her slightly reddened face. Using a voice that only the two of them could hear, he slowly said, \u201cGirl, I will get rid of the \u2018White Gang\u2019 half a year later!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The young lady suddenly smiled. Her smile was beautiful, gentle and moving, causing the hearts of those by the side to be moved. She had never doubted him ever since she was young.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

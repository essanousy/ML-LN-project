Xiao Zhan\u2019s disappearance may also mean that the portion of the \u2018key\u2019 belonging to the Xiao clan has also disappeared with him. Xiao-jie also knows just how seriously the clan views that thing.\u201d</p><br/><p>TL: xiao-jie - young miss/lady from a well off or powerful family</p><br/><p>\u201cDid the clan send someone to investigate the whereabouts of uncle Xiao Zhan?\u201d Xun Er knit her eyebrows slightly before suddenly asking a moment later.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey have begun to investigate. However, they don\u2019t have any news for the time being. The only ones who know about the details of Xiao Zhan\u2019s disappearance is perhaps the First Elder of the Misty Cloud Sect who had given chase back then. Unfortunately, Xiao Yan has already killed him in his anger.\u201d Ling Ying shook his head and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan ge-ge values uncle Xiao Zhan greatly. Xiao Zhan was chased by the Misty Cloud Sect until he ended up disappearing. Xiao Yan was naturally furious to the point that he lost a little of his reasoning.\u201d Xun Er sighed. Immediately, she changed the topic and said, \u201cTell me about Father\u2019s order first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe clan head has said that if xiao-jie (young miss) continues to be unable to find that portion of the key, you will have to immediately return to the clan. Since, the key has already gone missing following Xiao Zhan\u2019s disappearance, there is no need to waste your time on young master Xiao Yan.\u201d Ling Ying said softly, \u201cXiao-jie (young miss), with your repeated refusal to return and your staying with young master Xiao Yan, the clan head might have vaguely guessed something. He appears to be extremely dissatisfied with this. There are some Elders in the clan who also think this way. They think that young master Xiao Yan is not worthy of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er\u2019s face was calm. Hre face did not even move a little because of this. A long while later, she finally said indifferently, \u201cThey will naturally know whether he is worthy of me in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, you cannot wait until the future. Xiao-jie should have already returned to the clan when young master Xiao Yan left Wu Tang City back then. You have already dragged this matter along for three years. There is an increasing amount of dissatisfaction within the clan. After all, your importance to the clan is not something the other offshoot young miss and young master can compare with.\u201d Ling Ying said softly, \u201cTherefore, this time around, the clan head has issued a strict order. If you do not return within one month\u2019s time, there might be people from the clan who will personally come over. Xiao-jie likely doesn\u2019t wish to allow the current young master Xiao Yan to come into contact with the clan, right? You should clearly know that young master Xiao Yan\u2019s current strength does not give him the slightest qualification to be viewed seriously by the clan.</p><br/><p>The back of Xun Er\u2019s teeth bit her lower red lip. She clenched her delicate hand. A moment later, she nodded slightly. \u201cAh, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she already knew where the so called portion of the \u2018key\u2019 belonging to the Xiao clan was, she did not reveal it. This was because she clearly understood that Xiao Yan would definitely disappear should this news be spread into the clan.</p><br/><p>Ling Ying helplessly sighed as he eyed Xun Er\u2019s beautiful face that was as calm as water. He twisted his body and turned into a blurry black shadow before rushing into the darkness. Finally, he wiggled slightly and disappeared.</p><br/><p>It was a long while after Ling Ying disappeared before Xun Er slowly moved her footsteps and came before the window. She eyed the vast night sky, and a faint bitterness involuntarily surfaced on her face. She had never had the slightest doubt about Xiao Yan\u2019s potential. Even during the time that he had fallen into being a cripple from a genius back then, she had also believed that he would sooner or later once again stand at the peak where others looked up to. However, a genius was still just a grain in a vast sea in front of that faction that was so enormous that it caused people to be shocked. He could not cause them to pay much attention to him. The countless number of years of heritage had caused that ancient faction to witness the sudden rise and fall of geniuses, one after another. Therefore, the term genius would not cause them to be even the least bit attentive. What they cared about was only what kinds of achievement one currently had accomplished!</p><br/><p>Currently, Xiao Yan was merely a Dou Ling. Although he was not even twenty years old, this did not mean much. After all, the journey of one\u2019s cultivation was incomparably dangerous. No one dared to be certain or believe that Xiao Yan would be truly able to walk all the way to the peak of this cultivation journey and look down on everyone. That ancient faction was far too big. Therefore, unless one reached that pinnacle level, one would ultimately appear to be just like the difference between fifty and a hundred steps. There was basically not much fundamental difference between them.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey do not believe\u2026\u201d A faint ridicule was lifted on the corner of her mouth as Xun Er softly muttered, \u201cIt is fine with just me believing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>After one night of rest, Xiao Yan\u2019s energy was once again lively the next day. The moment he got out of bed, he spent half an hour completing the refinement of Zi Yan\u2019s \u2018Fire Spirit Root\u2019. Since Elder Liu did not state a time where he needed that \u2018Dragon Strength Pill\u2019, Xiao Yan was not in a hurry to refine it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan walked out of the room. He had just walked down the stars when Zi Yan\u2019s figure flashed and appeared like a ghost. Her dark-black eyes blinked as they stared at Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was neither able to laugh nor cry when he saw this manner of hers. He threw the jade bottle into her hand and could not help but quietly laugh in a bitter manner when he saw that joyous expression. This little girl may be very strong, but her mentality was not much different from someone of her age.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan finally ceased pestering Xiao Yan after obtaining some delicious Danwan that was filled with energy. However, she felt a little embarrassed at immediately wanting to leave after just obtaining the thing. Hence, she obediently sat in one corner. That tender and cute manner of hers caused Hu Jia by the side to have a desire to charge forward and viciously pinch her.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xun Er, Hu Jia, and Wu Hao were all present within the hall. Today, Wu Hao did not hurry over to the Fighting Arena. Even Xiao Yan and the others felt a little speechless at the fanaticism that this fellow had toward fighting.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan inquired about the recent matters occurring for \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019 from Xun Er and the rest during the time that he ate breakfast. He only sighed in relief after ensuring that everything was fine. No matter how one put it, he was ultimately the leader of \u2018Pan\u2019s Gate\u2019. Although he was not very responsible as its leader, he had never denied his status.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was just about to get up after eating his breakfast when the tightly shut door to the room was pushed open. Immediately, that loud voice of Lin Yan howled loudly within the hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, I heard that you have returned? Ha ha. Do you have time to spar today? These few days, I have not had any fun while fighting a couple of matches in the Fighting Arena. Those bastards simply run after seeing me.\u201d Lin Yan, who appeared looking careless, swaggered into the room. He ignored the helpless expressions of Xiao Yan and the others and directly came to the side of the table. He randomly grabbed a bun on the table and viciously took a bite while speaking in a vague manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh, who is this little girl\u2026 grug\u2026\u201d While the bun was being chewed in his mouth, Lin Yan ignored Xiao Yan and the others and suddenly turned his gaze toward Zi Yan who was seated by the side. He had just smiled and inquired when his face swiftly stiffened under Xun Er\u2019s, Xiao Yan\u2019s, and Wu Hao\u2019s stunned gazes. The bun which was chewed to pieces in his mouth was being violently spit out along with his saliva. A moment later, his entire face was filled with shock as he hurriedly withdrew as though he had been electrocuted.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 why are you here?\u201d An extremely shocked and sharp voice was emitted from Lin Yan\u2019s mouth as he stepped back.</p><br/><p>Xun Er, Hu Jia, and Wu Hao were at a loss when they saw this sudden change of Lin Yan. Only Xiao Yan understood that it was likely that this fellow had recognized Zi Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you shouting so loudly?\u201d Zi Yan covered her ears and said with extreme dissatisfaction to the shocked Lin Yan.</p><br/><p>Lin Yan swallowed a mouthful of saliva. He only quietly relaxed a little when he saw that Zi Yan had no other special action. He made a detour around the large table in the hall and carefully went behind Xiao Yan and the others. He said softly, \u201cDammit, why is this fellow here? Are all of you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are very well.\u201d Xiao Yan spread his hands and smiled as he replied.</p><br/><p>Lin Yan involuntarily widened his eyes when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s calm attitude. \u201cDo you know her identity?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled. He walked to Zi Yan\u2019s side and rubbed her head as he smiled and said, \u201cA very cute little girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCute\u2026\u201d The corner of Lin Yan\u2019s mouth twitched as he spoke in his heart. If you are able to see the frightening scene of how this fellow kicked all the competitors down from the arena during the last \u2018Strong Ranking\u2019 Grand Competition, you might no longer think so.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have already finished eating. Hmph, I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Zi Yan stuffed the breakfast into her mouth. She swung her head and shook Xiao Yan\u2019s hand off. With a snort to Lin Yan, she began leaping up and down as she walked out. She even turned to face Xiao Yan to speak just when she was about to exit through the door, \u201cRemember our agreement. Additionally, I feel that you are pleasant to look at. You can come and find me if there is anyone who dares to bully you. I will give a punch to every single one of those fellows just like that one beside you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl proudly waved her little fist after saying this. After which, she swung her purple ponytail before leaping and disappeared from the sight of Xiao Yan and the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit. Xiao Yan, when did you actually get to know the Brute Force Queen?\u201d Lin Yan only recovered his normal state following the disappearance of Zi Yan. His fist was smashed on Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders as he spoke with surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really unexpected that the person ranked first on the \u2018Strong Ranking\u2019 that you said you are extremely afraid of is actually such a little girl.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head and teased.</p><br/><p>Lin Yan\u2019s face turned somewhat flushed when he was mocked by Xiao Yan. He snorted and said, \u201cWith this monster protecting you, do you still need to be afraid of Liu Qing. That fellow can only take another path when he sees her.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am hoping for a little girl to back me up?\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and shook his head. As an alpha male, he really did not wish to rely on a little girl\u2019s name to swagger around triumphantly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and patted Lin Yan\u2019s shoulders. He was just about to say something when a hurried knocking sound was suddenly emitted from the door. Immediately, a human figure hurriedly charged inside after Xun Er responded in a soft voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAtai? What is it?\u201d Xiao Yan was involuntarily spoke in a stunned manner when he eyed the panting man who had rushed in.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, chief, there are some matters that involves you.\u201d Atai rubbed his head and said, \u201cYesterday, I had taken leave to return to the Outer Academy, only to hear that someone is looking for you urgently.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Who?\u201d Xiao Yan was slightly startled as he inquired with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems that she is called Xiao Yu. She even said that she is your older sister.\u201d Atai said, \u201cFrom her expression, she appears to have some urgent matters to inform you of. The Inner Academy doesn\u2019t allow the students from the Outer Academy to enter. Therefore, she asked me to inform you to go to take a trip to the Outer Academy no matter what.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed slightly. He understood Xiao Yu very well. She would not be so anxious unless something big that had happened. However, what could have happened while in the Outer Academy?</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan took two steps back and forth. He finally could not endure it any longer as he turned around and walked out of the door. He said in a deep voice, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

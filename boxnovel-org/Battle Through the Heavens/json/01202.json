Immediately, Old Mu Gu\u2019s eyes turned chilly as he cried out in a stern manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan neither heard nor bothered to deal with Old Mu Gu\u2019s cry. He brought the Sky Demon Puppet along and unleashed his speed to the maximum. He rushed toward the Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls who was blocking the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>An extremely deep killing intent surged into Old Mu Gu\u2019s eyes when he saw Xiao Yan ignore his cries. After which, he cried in out a deep voice to the black-clothed Dou Zun, who had been injured by the Three Thousand Burning Flame earlier.</p><br/><p>That black-clothed Dou Zun nodded upon hearing Old Mu Gu\u2019s cry. Those two rushed out at the same time. Their vast and mighty Dou Qi caused waves of ripples to appear.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bodies of the two had just moved a short distance when the space in front of them distorted. A figure slowly appeared and blocked these two.</p><br/><p>\u201cQiu Ling, get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Old Mu Gu\u2019s face turned chilly as he cried out when he saw Qiu Ling appearing in front of him.</p><br/><p>Qiu Ling merely let out a cold laugh in the face of Old Mu Gu\u2019s chilly cry. He did not utter any unnecessary words. The Dou Qi within his body was unleashed without being held back. After which, his body moved, and he hurried toward Old Mu Gu.</p><br/><p>Old Mu Gu\u2019s expression slightly changed upon seeing Qiu Ling hurry over. In his current state, he was no match for Qiu Ling. His eyes immediately slid to the black-clothed Dou Zun by his side. He suggested in a deep voice, \u201cLet\u2019s attack together and take care of this old fellow!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>That black-clothed Dou Zun also nodded upon hearing this. He was also badly injured. The special annihilation strength of the Three Thousand Burning Flame had caused the inside of his body to be seriously injured. With his current condition, he was unable to fight with Qiu Ling on his own. It was the best choice for the two of them to fight together.</p><br/><p>A cold smile flashed across Qiu Ling\u2019s eyes when he saw Old Mu Gu\u2019s group attack together. He did not withdraw. Instead, he approached them with an even fiercer stance.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The black-clothed Dou Zun engaged in an intense battle with old demon Qing Hua also sensed when Xiao Yan\u2019s group acted. His expression quickly changed as he tried to escape the battle. However, old demon Qing Hua continued to pester him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh, how unlucky. I met that old fellow Yao Chen back then when searching for a Heavenly Flame. Now, I have met his disciple while doing the same thing\u2026 forget it. Perhaps the old me does not possess that kind of fate. This time around, I shall help this little fellow on the account of my friendship with Yao Chen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Old demon Qing Hua glanced at Xiao Yan, who had rushed toward the Three Thousand Burning Flame. He quietly sighed in his heart before he charged forward. Dou Qi surged as he firmly pestered that black-clothed Dou Zun.</p><br/><p>\u2026...</p><br/><p>A continuous black fog surged out of the sleeves of the last Hall of Souls Dou Zun in all directions. The interior of the black fog appeared to be filled with an innumerable number of souls. They poured down like a storm. After which, they exploded on the fire body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame, causing the dark-black flame to ripple.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoon, this Three Thousand Burning Flame will not be able to endure for much longer\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The hearts of those Dou Zuns from the Hall of Souls sighed in relief as they watched the retreating purple-black flame of the Three Thousand Burning Flame. However, just when he was about to unleash a soul to self-destruct, an unusually terrifying wind suddenly appeared behind him, causing his expression to change.</p><br/><p>\u201cClang!\u201d</p><br/><p>While his expression had undergone a drastic change, the clothes on his back tore and black fog agglomerated into a chain that violently rushed out. After which, a wave of clear metallic sounds resonated through the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the chain had blocked the attack, the remnant force still shook this Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls until he took two continuous steps back. Only then did he stabilize his body. His expression was dark and cold as he raised his head, only to see a golden-colored figure standing where he had withdrew from.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, are you tired of living?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls swept his eyes around. He saw the Sky Demon Puppet standing behind Xiao Yan as he questioned him in cold voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAttack.\u201d Xiao Yan faintly glanced at the Dou Zun before softly commanding</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>After his voice sounded, the Sky Demon Puppet\u2019s feet immediately pushed against empty air. Xaio Yan could hear a slight muffled sound, and the puppet appeared in front of the Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls with lightning-like speed. It raised his golden-colored metal fist and created a terrifying wind that violently smashed toward the Dou Zun\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The expression of the Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls slightly changed when he saw the crumbling space where the Sky Demon Puppet\u2019s fist passed. He did not dare to slight it as he hurriedly used all of his strength to meet it.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan only smiled the instant he saw the Dou Zun from the Hall of Souls fighting with the Sky Demon Puppet. His head turned to the Three Thousand Burning Flame a short distance away. At this moment, the flame on the its body appeared a little dim. However, Xiao Yan discovered that waves of star strength were seeping out of the surrounding empty space. After which, they were absorbed by the Three Thousand Burning Flame into its body. Following the pouring in of this star strength, the flame on its body gradually grew stronger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed worthy of being an undying flame\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan felt a little awe in his heart upon seeing this scene. There was indeed a reason why this Three Thousand Burning Flame was called an undying flame. If it continued to absorb the strength of the stars, it was likely that it would recover its strength within a short while. At that time, it would be extremely difficult to deal with it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must not be allowed to continue to absorb the strength of the stars\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stepped through empty space as this thought flashed across his heart. He flashed and appeared in front of the Three Thousand Burning Flame. A jade-green flame slowly surged out of his body. After which, it completely wrapped around the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>The eyes of the Three Thousand Burning Flame were ice-cold as it looked at Xiao Yan in front of it. By the time the jade-green flame rose, its eyes had become a little stunned. Immediately, a desire that had never appeared before suddenly appeared in its eyes. Although it didn\u2019t know just what the jade-green flame was after having been sealed for so many years, its instincts told it that if it could devour the flame, it would no longer need to be afraid of the three great heads of the Pill Tower.</p><br/><p>The expression of desire in the eyes of the Three Thousand Burning Flame was also captured in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. He involuntarily shook his head. Back then, when the Fallen Heart Flame was looking at him, it also felt this emotion. The only difference was that the Fallen Heart Flame did not display its desire as prominently as the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether you can devour my Heavenly Flame will be determined by your ability\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed. A silver glow flashed under his feet and a thunderous roar resounded through the air. He appeared above the head of the Three Thousand Burning Flame in a ghost-like fashion. After which, his fist, surrounded by the jade-green flame, was violently smashed toward the Three Thousand Burning Flame\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Faced with this attack by Xiao Yan, the Three Thousand Burning Flame, which was in a disadvantageous position, was unwilling to withdraw. It swung its dragon tail and heavily smashed against Xiao Yan\u2019s fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two waves of flames were pressed into arcs as the two collided. After which, a wind surged and shook the space until dark-black fissures appeared.</p><br/><p>The fierce and powerful strength caused Xiao Yan and the Three Thousand Burning Flame to withdraw some distance. After which, the Three Thousand Burning Flame roared at the sky. It widened its dragon\u2019s mouth and an extremely terrifying purple-black fire pillar shot toward Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan let out a cold laugh when he saw the fire pillar being shot over. He was indeed no match for the Three Thousand Burning Flame at its peak. Unfortunately, its current condition was no longer even one-tenth of its peak.</p><br/><p>The fire pillar swiftly expanded in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. It was about to enter a ten-foot-region around his body when a thought passed through Xiao Yan\u2019s heart. The Glazed Lotus Heart Flame surged out of his body. Immediately, it transformed into a raging wall of fire.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The purple-black flame violently struck the jade-green wall of fire. The two Heavenly Flames had finally collided head-on. They wildly unleashed their terrifyingly destructive strengths\u2026</p><br/><p>The fire pillar swiftly rose into waves of ripples. However, regardless of how the Three Thousand Burning Flame burned, the jade-green wall of fire continued to remain stable\u2026</p><br/><p>The stalemate between the two continued for around ten minutes or so before the purple-black fire pillar finally began to gradually weaken due to the exhaustion of the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>A glow flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes as he looked at the somewhat sluggish Three Thousand Burning Flame. The jade-green wall of fire suddenly scattered. At the same time, a jade bottle appeared in his hand. It was thrown at the purple-black fire pillar that had yet to completely scatter.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The jade bottle burst apart on contact with the Three Thousand Burning Flame. A snow-white-colored liquid shot out of it.</p><br/><p>Chi chi!</p><br/><p>The liquid had just made contact with the purple-black flame when it suddenly erupted into waves of white fog. An icy-cold bone-chilling flow was present within the fog,</p><br/><p>Although the white fog swiftly scattered because of the purple-black flame, Xiao Yan had undoubtedly added to the misery of the Three Thousand Burning Flame. The dark-black flame on its body completely changed into the purple-black color of the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s now!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the dark-black flame lingering on the Three Thousand Burning Flame transformed back into a purple-black color, a glint suddenly flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. A lightning glow flashed under his feet and he disappeared in a strange manner amid rippling space. By the time he appeared, he was already above the head of the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan clenched his hand after appearing. Another tiny jade bottle appeared in his hand. After which, it was thrown by him with lightning-like speed. It violently struck the forehead of the Three Thousand Burning Flame. It broke with a \u2018bang\u2019 and a drop of dark-golden blood slowly appeared.</p><br/><p>The body of the Three Thousand Burning Flame immediately stiffened when the drop of dark-golden blood touched its forehead. The expression in its eyes revealed a dullness. At the same time, a strange seal vaguely surfaced on its forehead. From the looks of the seal, it was the same as the dragon seal on Xiao Yan\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed the dragon seal!\u201d</p><br/><p>A wild joy flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s face when he saw the strange symbol on the forehead of the Three Thousand Burning Flame.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

After which, his eyes made contact with the Little Fairy Doctor, Su Qian, and Xiao Li. The Dou Qi within their bodies quietly circulated. Only then did they slowly make their way to the hole that had been forcefully created by Zi Yan. They slowly walked in. They were extremely careful where they placed each footstep since they were unaware of what was hidden here.</p><br/><p>They made their way through the small tunnel before finally stopping inside of the cave a moment later. Standing at this spot, they could vaguely see some light emitted from within the cave. Some Magical Beast drawings were present on the rock walls surrounding the cave. At a glance they appeared to possess a stern, fierce aura. However, this kind of deterrence was completely useless against Xiao Yan\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>Su Qian walked at the front. Among all of them, he had preserved the most of his strength. He did not exhaust much strength while dealing with Old Ying Shan. It was safest to have him be at the front while exploring this cave where they were ignorant of possible traps.</p><br/><p>Within the cave were long rock stairs. The rock stairs extended into the faint darkness below where one had difficulty seeing. Some Moonlight Rocks, emitting a faint light, had been placed on the surrounding mountain walls in a mosaic manner, expelling the darkness within the cave.</p><br/><p>The couple of them walked along the rock stairs, slowly descending. Around ten minutes or so later, they finally arrived at the end. At the edge of this flight of stairs was a tightly shut rock door.</p><br/><p>The rock door was completely black in color with moss coverings all over it, giving it the faint sense of being extremely heavy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAllow me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Yan immediately volunteered when she saw that it was a rock door. Her little face was filled with excitement. This little girl seemed to like to destroy things.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should just wait quietly\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head and grabbed Zi Yan. After which, he nodded to Su Qian. No one knew the situation in this place. Hence, it was best to be careful.</p><br/><p>Su Qian smiled when he saw this. His shriveled hand slowly pressed on the rock door. After which, the expression in his eyes became stern. A majestic Dou Qi that was sufficient to destroy mountains and break rocks surged out of his arm in a lightning-like manner. After which, it violently smashed against the rock door with an extremely loud sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Rock fragments flew in all directions and the rock door was instantly covered with crack lines. With a \u2018bang,\u2019 the door suddenly collapsed. A glaring light suddenly shot out.</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes narrowed instinctively when the intense light appeared. Immediately, Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed slightly as he softly cried out, \u201cFirst Elder, be careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s cry had just sounded when a fishy wind shot from behind the rock door. The fierce wind pounced toward Su Qian at the front.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph!\u201d</p><br/><p>The sudden unexpected change did not cause Su Qian to panic. His hands curled as his gentle sleeves immediately turned into something as hard as metal. He violently swept them in front of him. The sharp sound of rushing wind whistled and resounded throughout the cave.</p><br/><p>\u201cClang!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the sleeves swept out, a wind surged out like a wave and smashed into the thing that was pouncing over. After which, Xiao Yan and the others heard a sharp scream as the enormous figure suddenly shot backwards, smashing heavily on the ground.</p><br/><p>Su Qian\u2019s sleeves moved once again after having forced back the sneak attacker with one strike. Wild wind whistled and the dust in front of him was completely expelled, revealing the space behind the rock door.</p><br/><p>An extremely spacious warehouse appeared in front of Xiao Yan\u2019s group. The light within the warehouse was extremely bright. All the surroundings of the warehouse had been built from tough Black Metal Rock. At a glance, this warehouse seemed to have been opened up from a Black Metal Rock vein.</p><br/><p>There were quite a number of shelves within the warehouse. Many scrolls were orderly arranged on them. On the other side, were quite a number of crystal cabinets. One could faintly see many rare medicinal ingredients placed within them\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s gazes slowly swept over the warehouse. Immediately, their gazes paused on the enormous snake-shaped Magical Beast on the ground. Clearly, it was the sneak attacker from earlier.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Dou Wang class Magical Beast dares to attack the old me\u2026\u201d Su Qian slowly walked into the warehouse. He glanced at the Magical Beast, which had coiled itself up. It showed its savage snake tongue to them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt should be the guardian of this place\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan also smiled. His gaze merely swept over the Magical Beast before turning to the warehouse. Surprise flashed across his eyes when he saw so many scrolls. He clicked his tongue and praised, \u201cIt is indeed worthy of being an ancient faction that has existed for so many years. This collection is indeed good.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese are all arranged in terms of class.\u201d Xiao Li involuntarily laughed as he walked closer to a bookshelf and looked at the \u2018Xuan class Low level\u2019 words written on it.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. His gaze swept around before he walked to the deepest part of the warehouse. An ordinary Xuan class Dou Technique or Qi Method would not catch his eye. He was somewhat curious about whether the Demon Flame Valley had a collection of high class Qi Methods or Dou Techniques that would cause even him to feel surprise.</p><br/><p>\u201cHiss hiss!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Xiao Yan\u2019s group had begun searching the warehouse without any fear, the enormous snake that was covered by green-colored scales immediately coiled and lifted its body. While extending its tongue, it swung its tail, carrying an enormous force that violently swept toward Xiao Yan\u2019s group.</p><br/><p>Its tail had just been swung, and had yet to approach its target when it was grabbed by a small hand disproportionate to the size of the tail. The owner of the small hand glanced at the enormous snake before curling her mouth. After which, she pulled the tail and dragged the snake out of the warehouse. Regardless of how the enormous snake struggled, the small hand that contained a frightening strength and did not tremble even a little\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little girl\u2019s brute strength is really frightening. I wonder just what kind of frightening existence her actual form is\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan involuntarily shook his head and sighed as he watched the wailing snake-shaped Magical Beast get dragged away out of the warehouse by Zi Yan and thrown into some unknown place\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI am also not very certain. When I saw this girl back then, she had already accidentally eaten a matured Body Transforming Grass. However, by being able to possess such a frightening strength as a child, it is likely that her actual body is extraordinary\u2026\u201d Su Qian knit his brows and replied, \u201cHowever, it is rumored that there are quite a number of mysterious Magical Beast clans south of the Central Plains in the continent. The strength of the Magical Beast clans are extremely powerful. Perhaps, one might be able to obtain a little information about this little girl\u2019s actual form there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMagical Beast clan?\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s footsteps paused when he heard this somewhat foreign name.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn those places, most of the Magical Beasts live together like a tribe. Moreover, when they reach a certain level, some Magical Beast, especially the unique beasts who possess an ancient bloodline, gain an intelligence that is not inferior to that of humans. Moreover, they are able to transform into a human shape. Adding this to their long lifespan, their foundation strength is naturally quite great. Even an ordinary human faction would not dare to offend them. Of course, there are\u2026\u201d Su Qian stared at Xiao Yan when he spoke until this point and said, \u201cThere are some human clans that have a heritage that also originate from ancient times\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s walking footsteps suddenly paused. A moment later he quietly nodded. He knew that what Su Qian was saying was likely the kind of mysterious clan similar to the one behind Xun Er.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Central Plains is the most interesting place in the Dou Qi continent. The size of that place is incomparably wide with experts as numerous as the clouds. One can say that standing at the peak of that place is equivalent to standing at the peak of the Dou Qi continent\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian smiled faintly and said, \u201cAt that place, you might gradually come into contact with the faction behind your little girlfriend. However, it is fortunate that the current you is no longer that small Da Dou Shi when you had just entered the academy. There are some things which you gradually possess the strength to fight for. However, you have only obtained the qualification to fight for it. If you wish to reach that step in your heart, you will need an even greater strength\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded gently. His hand slowly caressed a scroll in front of him. He inhaled a deep breath of air and slowly suppressed the storm within his heart. However, that pretty face, like an ethereal lotus blooming within this mundane world, quietly surfaced. This face had difficulty disappearing.</p><br/><p>\u201cXun Er\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The hand under Xiao Yan\u2019s sleeves was suddenly tightened. A heat that was difficult to hide also rose within his eyes. He clearly remembered the words that Xun Er had told him before she left. Before reaching the Dou Zong class, he must not make contact\u2026 it was likely that she was worried about the various obstructions from within the clan when they met.</p><br/><p>\u201cDou Zong huh\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The young face revealed a determination under the light. From the way he saw it back then, a Dou Zong appeared to be a distant and unreachable level. Now, however\u2026 it was within reach.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait for me\u2026 at that time, I will let everyone in your clan know that your eyesight is the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan softly muttered in his heart. His eyes also erupted into a heated expression that one had never seen, ambition and anticipation. The so-called trash of the Xiao clan would ultimately give everyone a big shock!</p><br/><p>By the time Xiao Yan\u2019s withdrew his mind, his footsteps had also come to a stop. He had already walked to the end of the warehouse without realizing it. The shelves beside him did not have many scrolls like the ones in front. Instead, it only had four ancient wooden boxes. These few wooden boxes were wrapped in wrought iron with some ancient drawings carved onto them. One could tell at a glance that they were not ordinary items.</p><br/><p>The surroundings of this bookshelf were not without any protection like the other bookshelves. There was a faint light barrier around them, isolating them. The dense energy vaguely being emitted by the light barrier caused surprise to flash across Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. Good things did indeed need to be a little unique\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was not in a hurry to forcefully damage this light barrier. As this thought flashed across his heart, his gaze slowly swept around the bookshelf, and immediately paused on two simple words above the bookshelf.</p><br/><p>\u201cDi class!\u201d</p><br/><p>A smile surfaced on Xiao Yan\u2019s face as he looked at these two words. It seemed that his trip was not wasted this time around. Di class Qi Methods and Dou Techniques were rare items. Moreover, for them to be able to be placed so preciously by the Old Ground Demon Ghost, it was likely that they were not some ordinary items...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

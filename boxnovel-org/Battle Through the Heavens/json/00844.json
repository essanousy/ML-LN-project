A Dou Spirit Pill and a Mighty Huang Pill, these two kinds of medicinal pills were exquisite medicinal pills able to raise the strength of a Dou Wang and Dou Huang respectively. This kind of medicinal pill possessed quite a great attraction to some experts present. After all, when one reached the Dou Wang and Dou Huang class, attempting to raise one\u2019s strength by one star was not a simple task. Sometimes, it was not impossible to exhaust a couple years of effort.</p><br/><p>A few years of bitter training required one medicinal pill to make up for it. This was undoubtedly the main reason for these experts to become crazy right now.</p><br/><p>Similar to the Dou Spirit Pill, a medicinal pill like the Mighty Huang Pill would rarely be taken out by any faction to auction off. After all, as long as one possessed such a pill, one would be able to raise the strength of some core experts within one\u2019s sect. This was very beneficial in terms of overall strength.</p><br/><p>Hence, everyone was stunned when they heard that there was actually someone who would open his mouth to trade these kinds of medicinal pill. The gazes of the entire auction ground were all turned to a VIP seat. They all landed on the black-robed person who was slowly standing up. In an instant, various surprised private conversations began to repeatedly appear.</p><br/><p>The people in the VIP seats were much calmer compared to the many surprised voices coming from the crowd. After all, they knew that this mysterious black-robed person was a tier 6 alchemist. Usually, an alchemist would choose to use medicinal pills in exchange for things first. However, they still could not resist shaking their heads when they heard Xiao Yan quoting a Dou Spirit Pill and a Mighty Huang Pill right from the start since they were both extremely valuable medicinal pills. He was indeed worthy of being a tier 6 alchemist. This manner of spending was something that an ordinary person could not compare with.</p><br/><p>A Dou Spirit Pill and a Mighty Huang Pill. Given the value of these two medicinal pills, they would definitely be able to exchange for gold coins in the range of eight million. This amount was considered quite great.</p><br/><p>The white-haired old man on the auction stage sighed in relief in his heart when he heard someone issue an opening bid. He swept the perspiration off his forehead without anyone noticing. A thought made its way into his heart. A Dou Spirit Pill and a Mighty Huang Pill might indeed be very valuable, but the Magical Beast corpse they were being used to exchange for appeared to dwarf them. No matter how one put it, this large fellow was an ultimately a fierce beast that was about to leap into the 8th rank. Although this ultimately fierce beast had already turned into a dried corpse, even the might of a tiger would remain after it died, much less a Magical Beast of this rank.</p><br/><p>The white-haired old man threw his gaze toward a certain spot of the auction ground without leaving a trace while this thought flashed in his heart. After seeing the person there shake his head, he could only sigh within his heart. His face was still filled with smiles as his eyes swept over the VIP seats. He smiled and said, \u201cThis mister bids one Dou Spirit Pill and one Mighty Huang Pill. May I know if anyone is offering a higher bid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I bid one Di class low level Dou Technique?\u201d A hesitant voice sounded after the white-haired old man\u2019s voice rang out.</p><br/><p>The white-haired old man was startled when he heard this. He smiled bitterly, shook his head, and replied in the direction of the voice, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, although a Di class Low level Dou Technique is quite valuable, our Black Emperor Sect still prefers the Dou Spirit Pill and Mighty Huang Pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man who had spoken could only helplessly shake his head when he heard this. He muttered a couple of words in his mouth before sitting back down. It was likely that he had lost the interest to issue another bid for this Magical Beast\u2019s corpse.</p><br/><p>After the old man sat down, the people in the VIP seats remained silent. Many people did not feel an exhilaration from such a gambe. After all, if they really spent a sky high price to purchase a useless corpse, their losses would really cause one to have the impulse to smash a wall.</p><br/><p>The stomach of the white-haired old man was filled with depression as he looked at the atmosphere that had become silent once again. A Dou Spirit Pill and a Mighty Huang Pill were far from the estimated price that the Black Emperor Sect had placed on this Magical Beast corpse. If they were to simply sell it like this, they would be the one\u2019s who would suffer a loss\u2026</p><br/><p>While the white-haired old man was depressed, the red-haired Fang Yan and the couple of Elders beside him in the seats of the Demon Flame Valley finished their discussion. He slowly stood up in front of a countless number of gazes.</p><br/><p>Fang Yan smiled and cupped his hands in Xiao Yan\u2019s direction. After which, he spoke to the white-haired old man on the auction stage, \u201cEven if our Demon Flame Valley had a medicinal pill like the Mighty Huang Pill, we would definitely not take it out. However, I have a Di class Middle level Dou Technique here. Don\u2019t be quick to judge. You can wait until I have told you about its effects before deciding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Dou Technique is called the \u2018Flame Creation Skill\u2019. It is somewhat harsh to practice. The practitioner must be someone who practice a fire affinity Qi Method. This kind of Dou Technique would not only enable a person to swiftly control any flame but it is also able to transform the Dou Qi within one\u2019s body into an energy flame that is not real. Of course, this is not what it is praised for. Its greatest use is that if another person who practices this Dou Technique were to use it at the same time, the energy flame that is formed can temporarily be merged. The energy flame after such a merger will transform into an actual flame. Its strength is extremely shocking and could even be comparable to a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019! As long as your Black Emperor Sect obtains this Dou Technique and finds a sufficient number of suitable people to practice it, the strength of the flame after the merger might really be comparable to a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019...\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Yan\u2019s faint words immediately stirred quite the large commotion the moment they sounded in the auction grounds. This kind of powerful Dou Technique that could form something comparable to a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 after merging was something that they had never heard of. Most of the people seated knew what a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was. They had also heard a little about the frightening might of this thing. Hence, the sound of exclamations repeatedly sounded within the auction grounds.</p><br/><p>This so-called \u2018Flame Creation Skill\u2019 had also caused Xiao Yan\u2019s heart to suddenly leap while it stirred a commotion within the auction ground. He did not have much interest in the merger of the flames to create a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 that Fang Yan had spoken about. The thing that caused him to be interested was the sentence \u2018enable a person to swiftly control any flame\u2019...</p><br/><p>There were many flames within Xiao Yan\u2019s body and there might be even more in the future. How he was going to control these \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 was his greatest problem. A \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was originally wild and violent. Controlling one exhausted an unnatural amount of strength. Normally speaking, Xiao Yan would have to spend a large amount of time and effort in order to control a \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 after obtaining one. Moreover, as more \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 were merged in the future, controlling them all would naturally be very troublesome. If he possessed this \u2018Flame Creation Skill\u2019, it was likely that this skill would provide Xiao Yan with lots of help when that time came\u2026</p><br/><p>If Xiao Yan\u2019s heart was not rational, might have turned his head and exchanged for the \u2018Flame Creation Skill\u2019 in that fellow\u2019s hands this instant. After all, this thing might be of critical importance to him in the future.</p><br/><p>The white-haired old man, who was initially disappointed, could not resist nodding his head unnecessarily after hearing the marvellous effects of this \u2018Flame Creation Skill\u2019.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I\u2019m afraid that Elder Fang Yan has not revealed everything, no? Although the old me has been in a retreat for many years, I am also aware of some of the matters in the Demon Flame Valley. This \u2018Flame Creation Skill\u2019 might be marvellous but each time one uses his energy for the merger, it will cause the user to suffer an everlasting harm. Once or twice is fine. However, if it is used a couple more times, it is likely that one would just die. My Black Emperor Sect does not have so many experts to deplete in such a manner. Therefore, this Dou Technique of yours might be quite good, but it does not have much use to our Black Emperor Sect.\u201d A faint old laugh suddenly sounded just as the white-haired old man was hesitating. A golden figure immediately appeared on the auction stage in a strange manner. Everyone looked over and found that it was actually the sect leader of the Black Emperor Sect, Mo Tian Xing.</p><br/><p>Fang Yan was also startled when he saw that Mo Tian Xing decided to appear in such a sudden manner. He immediately laughed in a somewhat embarrassed manner before rubbing his nose and saying, \u201cSince sect leader Mo is not interested in this Dou Technique, we\u2019ll just forget about it. Coincidentally, I was feeling somewhat uncertain in my heart. Should I pay a great price to purchase a useless corpse, it is likely that the sect leader would give me a vicious scolding.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fang Yan sat back in his chair after speaking these words full of hidden mockery. From the looks of his manner, it seemed that he was unwilling to place another competing bid for this Magical Beast corpse.</p><br/><p>Mo Tian Xing knit his brows when he heard these words of Fang Yan. A faint chill quietly appeared in his eyes. Immediately, he threw a friendly gaze to Xiao Yan and laughed as he said, \u201cThis friend. Everyone here are wise men. Although there is quite a great risk in auctioning for this Magical Beast corpse, you will reap a huge reward if there is really something within it. Hence, the old me has personally come forward. If you are able to take out five Dou Spirit Pills and four Mighty Huang Pills, this Magical Beast corpse shall be left to you to deal with.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mo Tian Xing\u2019s words caused an uproar within the auction ground. Quite a number of people involuntarily rolled their eyes. This old fellow really knew how to rip someone off. Five Dou Spirit Pills and four Mighty Huang Pills\u2026 why doesn\u2019t he just go and die? How could one state such a price?</p><br/><p>\u201cThree Dou Spirit Pills and one Mighty Huang Pill.\u201d Xiao Yan, who was wrapped within a black robe, faintly replied amid the uproar.</p><br/><p>\u201cFour Dou Spirit Pills and three Mighty Huang Pills.\u201d Mo Tian Xing knit his brows and responded in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes sect leader Mo think that it is so easy to refine medicinal pills?\u201d Xiao Yan laughed as he said, \u201cI shall not bargain with you any longer. Three Dou Spirit Pills and two Mighty Huang Pills. Honestly speaking, I am in the same boat as everyone else. I don\u2019t possess much boldness to engage in such a gamble. After all, who knows if the interior of the Magical Beast is just a pile of dried rotten flesh?</p><br/><p>Mo Tian Xing frowned after being viciously checkmated by Xiao Yan. He mused for a long while before finally nodding his head in front of many stunned gazes.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, we\u2019ll accept your offer!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Mo Tian Xing\u2019s mouth was quietly lifted into a pleasing smile without anyone noticing the moment he nodded. However, he did not discover that Xiao Yan, who was covered by black robes, had also lifted a cold smile onto his lips.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

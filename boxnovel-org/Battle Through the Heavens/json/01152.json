His eyes swiftly looked to the night sky above his head. However, it was completely empty. There was not a single person there. However, the vast, mighty aura spreading down caused him to feel some fear\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s someone from the Pill Tower\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan sighed in relief within his heart. The Extermination Fire Lotus he was merging quickly paused before he carefully scattered it. His toes pressed on the ground, and he swiftly pulled back. A clear long roar was also emitted.</p><br/><p>Swoosh swoosh!</p><br/><p>The clear roar had just sounded when two figures rushed over to the courtyard as fast as lightning. They had appeared beside Xiao Yan in an instant. At the same time, their eyes were furiously looking at the mysterious, black-robed person in the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alright?\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor glanced at the messy courtyard. Her grayish-purple eyes stared at the black-robed person in an icy manner while her mouth asked a question full of concern.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan shook his head and he replied with a deep voice, \u201cI\u2019m alright. Be careful. This fellow is not an ordinary person\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tian Huo zun-zhe\u2019s face was a little ugly as he stared at the mysterious, black-robed person. He said with a cold smile, \u201cYou are an elite Dou Zun no matter how one puts it. Why are you sneaking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the hearts of the Little Fairy Doctor and Tian Huo zun-zhe were undoubtedly furious. From the looks of the courtyard, it was obvious that it had just experienced a big battle. Moreover, the two of them did not sense a thing. The poor protection they provided would really cause one to feel ashamed.</p><br/><p>The mysterious, black-robed man remained suspended in the air. His sinister gaze flickered as he glanced at Xiao Yan. It was unexpected that the old fellows from the Pill Tower had managed to discover him despite him being so careful. His trace had already been locked onto by them. If he continued to stay any longer, it was likely that the experts from the Pill Tower would make it here soon\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cXuan Kong Zi, this matter has nothing to do with your Pill Tower. Why must you bother in other people\u2019s business?\u201d The black-robed person cried out to the sky in a dark voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, this is Holy Pill City. If your Hall of Souls can randomly act atrociously in this place, how will my Pill Tower account to the public?\u201d The voice filled with a vicissitude slowly resonated from the sky. This time around, Xiao Yan could sense that this voice was emitted from empty space. Clearly, the person who had spoken had yet to arrive here. Instead, he was using a mysterious method to deliver his aura and deter this mysterious, black-robed person.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld bastard\u2026\u201d The black-robed person clenched his teeth and softly cursed. After which, his dark, sinister eyes turned to Xiao Yan. He coldly said, \u201cConsider yourself lucky. The Heavenly Flames and the Qi Method shall remain with you a little longer. Remember, I will take them back sooner or later!\u201d</p><br/><p>The space behind him instantly distorted after he spoke. His figure became partially visible because of the distorted space.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wish to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s eyes turned chilly when she saw this. A gray Dou Qi lingered on her hand before suddenly transforming into a grayish pillar that quickly shot through the air, rushing toward the black-robed person.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, with the two of them protecting you, I am indeed unable to do anything to you. However, you will also not be able to stop me if I wish to leave!\u201d The black-robed man let out a cold laugh when he saw the Little Fairy Doctor attempt to stop him. He flicked his finger and a wisp of a deep-blue flame shot out of his finger. After which, it violently collided with her grayish Dou Qi. Both of them destroyed each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, I will come and look for you again. I will definitely take your Heavenly Flames and your Qi Method the next time we meet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A pair of dense eyes stared at Xiao Yan from under the black robe after that person easily blocked the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s Woeful Poison Dou Qi. Immediately, the figure moved his body and entered the distorted space. The space rippled and his body disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will await you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s dark-black eyes were scary. He could sense that this person was quite strong. However, if they were to engage in an all out fight, Xiao Yan had the confidence that the other party would not be left in good shape.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor involuntarily clenched her silver teeth and softly cursed after watching the black-robed person safely leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cForget it\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan waved his hand. After which, he turned his eyes to the sky, cupped his hands together, and respectfully said, \u201cThank you elder for lending a hand!\u201d</p><br/><p>The light of the stars in the sky suddenly agglomerated after Xiao Yan\u2019s voice sounded. The light transformed into a blurry, elderly light figure. The old voice filled with vicissitude was slowly emitted, \u201cThe old me cannot step away. The old me can only split my attention and act as a deterrence. This person is extremely mysterious. You should be more careful. If you have the time, you can come to the Pill Tower. You will be very safe there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you elder\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan once again cupped his hands together. This elderly light figure should be an expert from the Pill Tower. He might even be one of the legendary three great heads\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI will naturally need to take good care of the disciple of an old friend. Be careful of the Profound Xuan Sect. They were the ones who revealed information about you to that person earlier\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The elderly light figure faintly smiled. After which, the star light fluctuated and slowly scattered\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan contemplated the situation as he studied the spot where the figure made of star light had disappeared. It seemed that his teacher\u2019s relationship with these people from the Pill Tower was quite good\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is the one who attacked you earlier?\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor turned her head, looked at Xiao Yan, and asked a question with knit eyebrows.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone from the Hall of Souls\u2026\u201d A cold glint flashed across his eyes as he softly replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person\u2019s Spiritual Strength has reached the pinnacle. The Spiritual Lock that he used from such a close proximity deceived the Little Fairy Doctor and me\u2026\u201d Tian Huo zun-zhe spoke with a solemn face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded. He did not manage to see the appearance of the black-robed person since the very beginning. Moreover, the voice he had heard did not appear too old, yet based on what he had said, this person was an expert from the same generation as Yao Lao. According to common sense, he should also be one of those old men who would not die\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cHis strength should be a little stronger than mine. However, if we were to go all out, he might not be able to defeat me\u2026\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor parted the black hair in front of her forehead as she said, \u201cHowever, this Profound Xuan Sect is really a source of trouble\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression was a little cold. He had forgotten about the conflict he had with that group of people a couple of days back. Most of the people from the Profound Xuan Sect were people who would take revenge for any offense. It was impossible for them to simply leave things be. However, it was unexpected that they did not act personally. Instead, they had leaked information about him. Using others to kill him. This tactic was really ruthless\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cTomorrow, try to think of a way to learn the location of the people from the Profound Xuan Sect. Being tracked by others with ill intent is not good. This trouble needs to be resolved\u2026 regardless of what kind of background they have. Since they have already climbed above my head, it is only natural that we cannot sit back and do nothing.\u201d Xiao Yan slowly said.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor nodded. The people from the Profound Xuan Sect had come swinging at them. They could only blame themselves for being merciless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one who has me the most worried is that black-robed person from earlier. We are unclear about his background\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes slightly flickered. A moment later, his eyes coagulated, \u201cThe Sea Heart Flame is also in the hands of this person\u2026 perhaps Han Feng knows a little information related to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan suddenly clenched his hand when this thought flashed across his heart. A jade bottle appeared in his hand. His finger rubbed over the mouth of the bottle before emitting a suction force. An illusionary spiritual body rose up in an extremely weak manner. From the appearance of the spiritual figure, it was Han Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho in the Hall of Souls did you gift your Sea Heart Flame to?\u201d Xiao Yan glanced at this extremely weak Han Feng and asked with an icy voice.</p><br/><p>Han Feng was initially startled upon hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s question. Immediately, his eyes flickered. However, before he could say anything, an invisible flame rose on the tip of Xiao Yan\u2019s finger. It pierced toward the illusionary body lightning quick.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t\u2026 I will speak. I will speak\u2026\u201d Han Feng hurriedly cried out in shock upon seeing Xiao Yan\u2019s vicious, unhesitating tactic.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe one who took my Sea Heart Flame is an honorable elder in the Hall of Souls. People call him Old Mu Gu. His position in the Hall of Souls is quite high because he is a genuine tier 8 alchemist on top of being a Dou Zun, and he is much valued by the hall chief of the Hall of Souls\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Mu Gu\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan uttered this name softly in his mouth. The coldness in his eyes became denser. It was indeed those bastards from the Hall of Souls.</p><br/><p>\u201cOld Mu Gu has an extremely deep, old grudge with Yao Chen. It is rumored that the both of them had the same teacher. However, due to some reason, Old Mu Gu was expelled. Therefore, he views Yao Chen with great enmity. He will find any opportunity to make trouble with Yao Chen. Back then\u2026 back then, I was played by him when I attacked Yao Chen. He wanted me to quietly steal the Flame Mantra\u2026\u201d Han Feng carefully revealed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression involuntarily changed when he heard his words. This Old Mu Gu once had the same teacher as Yao Chen?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it that I have never heard teacher mention this?\u201d Xiao Yan asked in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have also never heard him mention it. This matter is something that Old Mu Gu occasionally mentioned to me\u2026\u201d Han Feng hurriedly replied, afraid that Xiao Yan would attack him.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slowly nodded. If Han Feng\u2019s words were true, that mysterious, black-robed person from earlier should be Old Mu Gu. After all, there were very few people who knew about the Flame Mantra. Even some of those close to Xiao Yan were unaware of it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person will never give up in order to get what he wants. He will definitely try his best to strike again. However, he would not dare to openly attack me with the strength currently beside me. There shouldn\u2019t be an issue if we are careful in the future\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Pill Gathering is about to begin. Right now, the plan is to get into the top ten of the Pill Gathering and obtain the Three Thousand Burning Flame. At that time, I will no longer need to fear this old fellow even if I have to fight him alone the next time we meet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes twinkled. A moment later, he finally made up his mind. With a wave of his hand, he returned Han Feng\u2019s soul into the jade bottle and threw it into his Storage Ring. After which, he turned around and walked into his room.</p><br/><p>\u201cFind information on those people from the Profound Xuan Sect tomorrow. Once is too many when it comes to such a thing\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor slowly nodded when she heard Xiao Yan\u2019s words filled with killing intent. She was aware that Xiao Yan had been truly angered this time around\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

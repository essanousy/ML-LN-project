Due to the smooth, round, and glossy pill, a strong, nice fragrance pervaded the room, causing everyone to feel attentative.</p><br/><p>Watching the pills, the two managers of the Primer Auction House, Ya Fei and Gu Ni, couldn\u2019t hide the glee on their faces.</p><br/><p>Through the black gown, Xiao Yan could see that the two were forgetting themselves in front of him, which caused him to inwardly express disapproval and ridicule them: \u201cIf they knew that Yao Lao skimped on the materials when he made this Qi Gathering Powder, what would their expressions be like?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Qi Gathering Powder Xiao Yan brought was very much inferior to the product he himself used and yet this powder, half-heartedly created by Yao Lao, was able to surprise both Ya Fei and Gu Ni.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy dear sir, your alchemy techniques are truly admirable. The Qi Gathering Powder you created can already be compared to that made by fifth tier alchemists.\u201d Gu Ni wholeheartedly praised the light green pill.</p><br/><p>Under the black cloak, an old voice lightly rang out: \u201cPlease receive this Qi Gathering Powder well. After receiving so much help, I just had to express my thanks or else my conscience would be deeply perturbed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaha, sir, you are too kind. You are a guest here and the favors between us are simply favors between friends.\u201d Ya Fei smiled while lifting up the case with jade-like hands.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao refrained from commenting. Not only did Yao Lao not believe those words, even Xiao Yan scoffed at them as well. If it were really as she said, the Primier Auction House would have been bankrupt already.</p><br/><p>From inside his clothes, Xiao Yan produced a piece of paper and handed it to Ya Fei. The old voice rang out: \u201cPlease do me another favor by finding these materials for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eagerly accepting the paper, Ya Fei quickly glanced over it before complying with a smile. After the previous time, she dared not show any hesitation now.</p><br/><p>Ya Fei called forth a serving girl with a wave and passed the paper to her, instructing her to prepare the ingredients as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Teacup in his hands, Xiao Yan lightly sipped. Suddenly, he thought of something and after a few seconds, Yao Lao\u2019s voice could be heard: \u201cMiss Ya Fei, I have a question.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Yao Lao start to talk, Ya Fei smiled sweetly and gently replied: \u201cPlease go ahead sir.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Jia Lie Clan has bought a lot of medicine ingredients from here right?\u201d Yao Lao questioned in a monotonous voice.</p><br/><p>At this question, Ya Fei\u2019s heart slightly tightened and the expression on her lovely face slightly changed. Stealthily sharing a quick glance with Gu Ni, she silently hesitated for a moment before replying: \u201cPreviously the Jia Lie Clan had indeed purchased almost 100,000 gold worth of medicine ingredients and these medical ingredients\u2026\u2026 also possess some healing properties.\u201d</p><br/><p>Slightly inclining his head, his old voice suddenly disappeared into silence.</p><br/><p>This sudden change in atmosphere from the black cloaked man caused Ya Fei\u2019s heart to feel somewhat nervous; she long ago knew that the former was preparing to help the Xiao Clan and yet the auction house kept selling large amounts of medicine ingredients to the Jia Lie Clan. Though she does not know his temperament, it is highly likely that this old gentleman would hold some grudge against the auction house.</p><br/><p>The mood in the hall gradually became oppressive, looking towards the silent black cloaked man, Ya Fei started to feeling restless. If it were not for Gu Ni constantly stopping her with his looks, she would have opened her mouth long ago.</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth of you should know what I intended to do by buying so much medicine ingredients last time right?\u201d A good while later, the old voice finally broke the stifling silence.</p><br/><p>Lightly nibbling on her red lips, Ya Fei slightly nodded her head and replied in a low tone: \u201cSir had intended to refine the ingredients into healing medication to aid the Xiao Clan, yes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust before I came, I handed over all of the refined healing medicine to the Xiao Clan.\u201d Slightly nodding, Yao Lao said in a deep voice: \u201cPerhaps in another two days, the Xiao Clan and the Jia Lie Clan will start to use healing medicine to battle for popularity in Wu Tan City.\u201d</p><br/><p>Faced with this kind of topic, Ya Fei did not know how to reply, thus she could only cleverly maintain her silence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe manufacturing of healing medication requires a large amount of low-grade medical ingredients. In Wu Tan City, besides Primer Auction House, no other medicine stall has the capabilities to provide such a large amount.\u201d Seeing the wordless Ya Fei, Yao Lao continued to remark to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the later stages of this healing medication battle, besides the price and quality, having a sufficient supply of medicine ingredients is a key factor.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThus I hope that Primer Auction House will decline to provide the Jia Lie Clan with medicine ingredients from now on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Yao Lao\u2019s voice resounded out, Xiao Yan\u2019s line of sight penetrated through the black mantle and focused upon the mature beauty who was as lovely as a fox spirit. He had less than two months left in Wu Tan City and thus, within this time, he had to help his father to defeat the Jia Lie Clan. Only then could he leave on the training journey with Yao Lao at ease.</p><br/><p>Ya Fei\u2019s charming face slightly changed as she heard Yao Lao\u2019s words. In a difficult position, she said: \u201cSir, our Primer Auction House has a rule that forbids us from involving in any kind of conflicts between the clans. If we agree to your request, that would be tantamount to indirectly helping the Xiao Clan, this is not in accordance to our rules\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can refine two Qi Gathering Pills for you free of costs.\u201d Yao Lao said, undisturbed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, it is not a problem of elixirs, truly\u2026\u2026\u201d The enticement of two Qi Gathering Pills caused Ya Fei\u2019s smooth hands to tremble, however she continued to endure.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree pills\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSir\u2026\u2026\u201d Ya Fei forced a smile, right beside her, Gu Ni\u2019s face contorted, three Qi Gathering Pills? That would be worth at least 500,000 gold right?</p><br/><p>\u201cFive pills!\u201d An aged voice armed with an indifferent tone relentlessly smashed against the baseline in Ya Fei\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHrrrr\u2026\u2026\u201d Ya Fei\u2019s large eyes screwed shut as she lightly inhaled a breath of ice-cold air. After a long time, her eyes abruptly opened, Ya Fei let out a bitter laugh as she said: \u201cSir, you\u2019ve won. From now on, Primer Auction House will never again provide the Jia Lie Clan with any medical ingredients!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiss Ya Fei\u2019s will is indeed somewhat beyond my expectations; one month later I will bring over the goods. Of course only if Primer Auction House does not let me down.\u201d Yao Lao said as he let out a small laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cSir, be at ease, Ya Fei knows who is important and who is not very clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>In any case, Ya Fei had already experienced many years in the auction house, thus she quickly calmed down. Between the Jia Lie Clan and an alchemist who was at the very least fourth tiered, there was absolutely no comparison. The choice was not hard to make, actually, the true difficulty laid in how to select the best moment to earn the greatest profits and Ya Fei was very satisfied with the current outcome.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

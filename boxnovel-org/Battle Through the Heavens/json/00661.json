He roughly described the situation back then. However, Yao Lao\u2019s eyes narrowed and his expression immediately changed when Xiao Yan spoke about the appearance of the people from the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 while he was killing Han Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said that Han Feng\u2019s Spirit was taken by a member of the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019?\u201d Yao Lao knit his brows and spoke with a solemn face.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye.\u201d Xiao Yan nodded. His heart became worried when he saw Yao Lao\u2019s serious manner, and he could not help but carefully ask, \u201cWhy? Teacher, is there something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao knit his brows and mused for a moment. He seemed to be considering something before he slowly spoke, \u201cIf it is like this, it is likely that Han Feng did not die so easily.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled. He discovered where the problem lay and immediately asked with a frown, \u201cTeacher, you mean that the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 will help him revive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should also be clearly aware that when a spirit has reached a certain strength, it is able to leave the body and remain alive. Of course, one\u2019s strength would be greatly reduced. This is similar to my current condition\u2026 moreover, the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 clearly possesses a deep understanding for spiritual bodies. Although I am not certain about why they want to capture the spiritual bodies that roam the continent, it is clear from their attack tactics that they clearly possess a great damaging effect toward spiritual bodies.\u201d Yao Lao voiced his thoughts, \u201cThat evil animal Han Feng had some connection with the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 in the past. Back then, the members of the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 had participated when he killed me. Fortunately, I had some preparations after that and managed to escape from the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHence, it is difficult to say for certain that the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 would not use some unusual method to allow him to remain alive in this world now that Han Feng is in their hands.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 is actually so troublesome. It really is an oversight\u2026 speaking in this way, it is likely that Han Feng is not completely dead. What a pity.\u201d Xiao Yan knit his brows and smiled bitterly as he shook his head, sighing somewhat regretfully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is nothing to feel pity about. From a certain point of view, you have already killed him once. Even if he remains alive with the help of the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019, his actual strength will definitely be greatly reduced. Even if he wanted to do something, it is likely difficult for him to pose much of a threat.\u201d Yao Lao shook his head and immediately spoke with a serious face, \u201cHowever, from what you have said, the thing that concerns me most is that those strange fellows from the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 already clearly know that my spirit is in your body. Perhaps, they will send a dispatch to attack you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAppropriate measures will be taken when the time come. Let\u2019s discuss this when they finally come and find me. Coincidentally, my father\u2019s disappearance seems to be somewhat related to them. It is just as well if they come.\u201d Xiao Yan raised his eyebrows and laughed coldly while possessing absolute confidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cGiven your current strength, you need not be afraid of being hunted by an ordinary member of the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019. However, the faction known as the \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 is really too strange and unpredictable. Even I am uncertain just how strong they actually are. Therefore, it is best to act carefully.\u201d Yao Lao voiced his opinion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is only natural. A lion must do its best if it wants to capture a rabbit. Moreover, we are now that rabbit. We will definitely end up being captured by them if we aren\u2019t careful.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and replied.</p><br/><p>Yao Lao nodded slightly. He mused for a moment and appeared to have recalled something. Suddenly, he turned his head toward Queen Medusa who was a short distance away and said with a smile, \u201cThere is something I wish to discuss privately with my disciple. Can you please step away for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Medusa pressed her eyebrows together after hearing Yao Lao\u2019s words. She glanced at Xiao Yan who was well before snorting coldly. After which, she turned around. Her body strangely disappeared from beside the bonfire with a flash.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really unexpected that her strength would actually increase this much after her spirit merged with that of the \u2018Heaven Swallowing Python\u2019. With her current strength, forget about you, it would be dangerous for me to attempt to beat her even with my current strength.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s gaze stared at the spot Medusa had disappeared from before sighing a moment later. There was actually a trace of fear in his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, teacher, you need not be worried. She will not act against me for at least a year. Moreover, if something were to happen to me, I am able to request that she intervenes. While you were in a slumber, I have taken advantage of her strength a couple of times to act in an imposing manner.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou little devil, really have a lot of wicked ideas. You are actually even able to subdue such a vicious woman. However, you should still be careful. This woman is just like an unruly female leopard. She will be a great assistant if you can tame her properly. However, once you fail, it is likely that you will be the first person she swallows in retaliation.\u201d Yao Lao smiled first before reminding Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s discuss some proper business first.\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s eyes stared at Xiao Yan. His gaze had some anxiety to it as he spoke, \u201cThe \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019 has already been successfully refined by you? In that case, the two kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019... have they merged?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan parted his mouth and smiled as he watched Yao Lao\u2019s manner. He slowly extended his hand and flicked his finger. A wisp of Glazed Lotus Heart Flame surfaced on it. Since Xiao Yan was in a weary state at this moment, the wisp of flame was very small. However, this did not hinder the frightening temperature from spreading.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe merger has really succeeded!\u201d Yao Lao\u2019s expression was somewhat excited as his gaze stared at that wisp of dark-green flame. This \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 was something that even he had not practiced. Hence, he was also uncertain whether it would truly able to swallow and merge the \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019. After all, only one \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 could exist within the body of a single person. This was common knowledge within the alchemist world. Even someone as strong as Yao Lao back then only dared to absorb one kind of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019, much less anyone else. However, this mysterious \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 had now broken this common sense and completely reversed it!</p><br/><p>One could imagine just what kind of commotion it would cause once the special effects of the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 were made public!</p><br/><p>One type of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 was sufficient to allow an alchemist or a fire affinity practitioner to possess an incredibly great strength. What if one had two types, three types, or even more? It would likely not be overboard to describe the great accumulated strength as being able to destroy the sky and earth.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled as he studied Yao Lao\u2019s agitated face. His finger was gently inserted into the wisp of dark-green flame. He immediately pulled it back and the dark-green flame was divided into two clusters of flame with different colors. The one on the left was green in color while the one on the right was colorless and invisible.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt can actually be separated after the merger?\u201d Yao Lao could not help but express great surprise when he saw the two clusters of familiar flame on both of Xiao Yan\u2019s hands. His face was immediately stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf they are separated, they consume a lot of Dou Qi. However, the advantage is that the two could be used for different purposes. If they are merged together, its strength is much more frightening.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled. He once again merged the two flames into the Glazed Lotus Heart Flame as he raised his head to Yao Lao and asked curiously, \u201cTeacher, what will be the rank of this Glazed Lotus Heart Flame that I have merged and formed on the \u2018Heavenly Flame Ranking\u2019?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao\u2019s hand swayed above the dark-green flame as he mused for a moment. He finally said somewhat helplessly, \u201cThose \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019 on the \u2018Heavenly Flame Ranking\u2019 are all extremely rare. Even I was unable to see all of them. Therefore, I am naturally unable to evaluate this Glazed Lotus Heart Flame of yours. However, from my guess, it should not be ranked lower than my \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan merely shrugged his shoulders at this vague reply.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026 since you have already swallowed and merged the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame\u2019, the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 should have evolved right?\u2019 Yao Lao suddenly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. I think that my \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 should have stepped into the Di class right?\u201d Xiao Yan rubbed his head and spoke uncertainly.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry and circulate your Qi Method. I will examine it.\u201d Yao Lao mused for a moment before placing his hand on Xiao Yan\u2019s heart as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan immediately did as he was told after hearing this. His mind moved, and the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 Qi Method within his body began to circulate rapidly. With the circulation of the Qi Method, the surrounding natural energy began to ripple swiftly as a natural energy swiftly entered Xiao Yan\u2019s body. After which, it underwent various refinements before being stored all over his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cAye. This energy absorption speed is indeed much stronger than before. From the looks of it, it has indeed entered the Di class. However, it should only be at the Di Class Low Level.\u201d Yao Lao withdrew his hand and immediately spoke with a smile, \u201cHowever, given the uniqueness of the \u2018Flame Mantra\u2019 Qi Method, it could be comparable to a Di Class Middle Level Qi Method even though it is at the Di Class Low Level. With this current Qi Method level, it should be sufficient for you to squander Dou Qi without worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded his head and laughed softly, \u201cTeacher, I have already merged two kinds of \u2018Heavenly Flame\u2019. Can I help you refine a body that can accommodate your spirit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Lao was startled when he heard these words of Xiao Yan. He immediately felt somewhat gratified in his heart. He rubbed Xiao Yan\u2019s head and spoke with a faint voice, \u201cIt might be barely possible if there are two types of \u2018Heavenly Flames\u2019 but there should not be much of a problem if my \u2018Bone Chilling Flame\u2019 is added. However, the ingredients needed to refine a body are really far too rare and even frightening. Therefore, we cannot rush this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are the ingredients needed? Now, I am also in possession of some strength within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. Perhaps I can get someone to look for them.\u201d Xiao Yan inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese things are not things that can be obtained by just searching.\u201d Yao Lao laughed bitterly. However, he could only helplessly nod his head when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s earnest gaze. He said, \u201cThere are not many things you need if you want to refine a body that could truly accommodate my spirit. It only requires three kinds of things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan hurriedly became focused when he saw Yao Lao lift three fingers. He immediately gave Yao Lao his ear as he listened carefully.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond, the blood essence of a rank 7 Magical Beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird, the skeleton of an elite Dou Zong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s originally solemn expression also gradually become dull when he heard the three things that slowly escaped from Yao Lao\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Bone Growing Blood Fusing Pill? This was something that Xiao Yan had some knowledge about. A medicinal pill at the peak of the seventh tier. It could even step into the eighth tier. Legend has it that it was an extremely great medicine that could immediately save a half-dead person who still had a breath left.</p><br/><p>The blood essence of a rank 7 Magical Beast? God, was that not describing Queen Medusa?</p><br/><p>The skeleton of an elite Dou Zong?</p><br/><p>This\u2026 did he really needed to go and look for an elite Dou Zong to kill? Given his current ability, it was difficult to say just who would kill who...</p><br/>\n</div>"}

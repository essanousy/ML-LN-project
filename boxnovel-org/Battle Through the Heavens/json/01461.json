A frighteningly dark and cold force spread from his hand. It immediately began to freeze one of Xiao Yan\u2019s hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is indeed the Spring Blood Crystal. This dark and cold force is really frightening\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan nodded joyously after seeing this crystal. He shook his hand and the ice crystal cracked. After which, he put the blood crystals into his Storage Ring. He looked at that Yao Ming and asked, \u201cHow can I rescue you? Do I destroy these four metal chains?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need for that. These metal chains are not the ones things that restrain me. Instead, it is the Yellow Spring Yin Rock attached to the ends of the chains. There is an endless dark and cold force surging from it that exhausts the Dou Qi within my body, causing me to remain in a weak state\u2026 there is an elaborate switch hidden between the metal chain and the mountain body. Once you shatter it, these metal chains will no longer be able to trap me despite being made of a unique material.\u201d Yao Ming shook his head and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly lifted his eyebrows. He moved and appeared at the end of a metal chain. He saw that the metal chain was indeed deeply inserted into a dark-black mountain-like outcropping. This mountain-shape was not large. It was only over a hundred feet in size, but the dark and cold force contained within it caused Xiao Yan to involuntarily shudder despite having the protection of a Heavenly Flame.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this the Yellow Spring Yin Rock?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan clenched his fist as he looked at the dark-black mountain. A vast and mighty Dou Qi surged and ruthlessly smashed into the mountain body.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>An enormous water wave spread with a rumble from the spot where Xiao Yan\u2019s fist landed. However, that dark-black mountain merely trembled. Xiao Yan\u2019s punch, which could seriously injure an elite Ban Sheng, failed to even leave behind a slight imprint on this rock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Yellow Spring Yin Rock has been refined by the dark and cold force in the spring for an uncountable number of years. It is extremely hard, possibly even indestructible. Even if I recover my strength, it would still be extremely difficult for me to destroy it.\u201d Yao Ming spoke in a hoarse voice after seeing the commotion that Xiao Yan stirred.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly knit his brows. He suddenly grabbed a metal chain with his hand and a sizzling white fog was emitted. He quickly removed his hand. A thick white frost had already spread across his palm. The interior of this metal chain seemed to be a void that was filled with a dark and cold force. Only now did he understand why this Yao Ming had been locked in this place for centuries\u2026</p><br/><p>Yao Ming\u2019s shriveled face revealed some disappointment after seeing that Xiao Yan\u2019s many attempts were futile.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe things in this Nine Serene Spring are indeed extraordinary\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head. He ceased doing anything pointless. He curled two fingers and an extremely pressurized wisp of his Heavenly Flame rose. It acted like a needle as it was gently inserted into the point where the metal chain had been inserted into the mountain body. A long while later, he finally touched an unusually hard circular object. He increased the force from his finger and the fire needle was ruthlessly inserted into that hard pellet-like object.</p><br/><p>\u201cCrack!\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment the fire needle pierced the pellet, Xiao Yan quickly sensed an unusual ripple that was emitted from the outcropping. That enormous metal chain actually broke apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has actually succeeded?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yao Ming, who was feeling a little disappointed in his heart, lifted his head. He looked at Xiao Yan with eyes that were filled with wild joy.</p><br/><p>While Xiao Yan was breaking Yao Ming\u2019s seal, it was extremely lively within a magnificent palace in the underground Serene Snake network. The leaders of the many Snake-People tribes had gathered there as their laughter echoed through the large hall.</p><br/><p>A black-clothed man was seated on the throne within the palace. He appeared quite handsome, but there was a dark chillness, which could not be hidden, on his brow. Both of his eyes were slightly shut. A glint flickered in them. His eyes appeared like poisonous snakes that could kill a person in an instant, leaving a chill in one\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Two ladies with enchanting figures carefully massaged the man\u2019s body as his large hand continuously roamed over the soft lovely bodies of the two ladies, causing their eyes to appear a little lost. The both of them appeared unusually enchanting.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The shut eyes of the black-clothed man were suddenly opened. A shocked expression was present in his eyes, \u201cThe seal has been broken?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTribe chief, what is it?\u201d An old man with a completely bright-red poisonous snake on his shoulders frowned and asked a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe seal suppressing Yao Ming has been broken\u2026\u201d The black-clothed man suddenly stood up. His expression was dark and cold as a faint voice was transmitted into the elder\u2019s ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? How is that possible?\u201d That elder\u2019s face drastically changed after hearing this news. He hurriedly withdrew the emotions on his face as glanced at those Elders and leaders of the various tribes within the large hall. After which, he softly said, \u201cYou should head over quickly. It will be over for the both of us if Yao Ming manages to escape. I will stabilize the situation here before hurrying over to support you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, he will not be able to rise again.\u201d</p><br/><p>The black-clothed old man sinisterly smiled. After which, his body moved, and he disappeared from the throne.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, there is an Elder who wishes to report something. The tribe chief has gone over to meet him. Everyone, please continue\u2026\u201d That elder stood up and smiled. He calmed everyone in the large hall when they saw the black-clothed man disappear.</p><br/><p>\u201cClang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan broke the final metal chain seal. After which, he dispersed the fire needle. He waved his sleeve and a gentle force supported Yao Ming, who was about to fall. \u201cYou have only just managed to escape and the Dou Qi within your body is completely exhausted. At this moment, even an expert Dou Zong can kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, it is unexpected that I, Yao Ming, can really endure until this day. Young friend, may I know your name?\u201d Yao Ming\u2019s body was extremely weak. Clearly, he was extremely excited. His eyes landed on Xiao Yan as he laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung friend Xiao Yan, I, Yao Ming, will never forget how you have rescued me. As long as I am able to get my revenge, I will use the strength of the entire Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe to help fulfill any request you make!\u201d Yao Ming\u2019s eyes stared intently at Xiao Yan as he spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled upon hearing this offer. He could sense the extremely dense gratitude in Yao Ming\u2019s words. Although this gratitude was a result of his hatred for Yao Xiaotian, this person was not the type who would harm someone who had helped him. Xiao Yan sighed in relief after determining this person\u2019s character. He flicked his finger and a medicinal bottle flew toward Yao Ming. He said, \u201cConsume some medicinal pills to recover your Dou Qi first. We cannot remain for too long here. Let\u2019s quickly leave this Nine Serene Spring. We will go and find trouble with Yao Xiaotian after you regain your strength.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAye, young friend Xiao Yan is right!\u201d Yao Ming nodded and unceremoniously swallowed the bottle of medicinal pills into his stomach. He understood that it was impossible for him to be a match for Yao Xiaotian in his current condition.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved his sleeve after having rescued Yao Ming. After which, both of them turned into two water arrows that shot up with lightning-like speed.</p><br/><p>Since Xiao Yan had stayed within the Nine Serene Spring for quite a long while, he had exhausted a significant part of the Dou Qi within his body. Hence, he swiftly took out a couple of medicinal pills and stuffed them into his mouth as a precaution while he hurried out of the spring.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan ended up meeting those endless number of strange snakes on the way back. Fortunately, Yao Ming seemed to possess a method to control them. All of the strange snakes fled into the distance after he emitted a strange sound, and Xiao Yan avoided the trouble of fighting with these strange snakes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and Yao Ming\u2019s speed increased significantly in the absence of any obstruction. Within less than ten minutes, he saw some light in the distance and sighed in relief. Xiao Yan waved his sleeve and suddenly sped up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe are about to exit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled as he traveled closer to the surface of the lake. His body shook as he grabbed Yao Ming. They broke through the surface of the water and landed on the lake.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>A muffled sound was suddenly emitted from the air above after Xiao Yan stabilized his body. A figure fell from the sky as the sharp sound of rushing wind continuously appeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cCai Lin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression changed after seeing that figure. He waved his sleeve and a gentle force surged out. This force received her before Xiao Yan grabbed with his hand and pulled Cai Lin beside him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have finally come out.\u201d Cai Lin sighed in relief after landing beside Xiao Yan. Her hand hurriedly rubbed away the blood on the corner of her mouth.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes became cold after seeing the trace of blood on the corner of Cai Lin\u2019s mouth. He did not open his mouth to ask anything. Instead, he slowly lifted his head. There was a black-clothed person suspended in the air. The black-clothes person was looking at Xiao Yan with an unusually dark and vicious pair of eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person suddenly arrived and dragged the three of us out. Qing Lin and the Little Fairy Doctor have been wounded by him\u2026\u201d Cai Lin clenched her teeth as she spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan looked at a spot a short distance from the spring. Both Qing Lin\u2019s and the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s auras were a little chaotic. They had both suffered a serious injury. His eyes became even icy.</p><br/><p>That black-clothed man in the sky looked at Xiao Yan and the skeleton-like Yao Ming with an extremely dense eyes. A vicious smile surfaced on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle bastard, since you dare to spoil my plans, this king shall bury you in this spring regardless of where you come from! This king will help you take care of these three beauties. This is the price that you will have to pay for your recklessness!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

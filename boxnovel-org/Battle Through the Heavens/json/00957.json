He would withdraw if his body was touched within ten exchanges? Although they were really confident in Xiao Yan, Han Tian was ultimately a genuine eight star Dou Huang regardless of how one put it. Even if Xiao Yan\u2019s actual strength was similar to his, saying these words was really a little arrogant\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, looks like little brother Xiao Yan really has great confidence in himself.\u201d Han Chi laughed. He was the first to recover after being stunned for a moment. Most of the people who could enter the Inner Academy were extremely talented individuals. Since Xiao Yan in front of him dared to open his mouth to say such words, he either purposefully used this to escape from the matter or he was really confident in his own strength. He really hoped that it was the latter in such a situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan\u2026 you\u2026 can you do it? Second uncle practices wind affinity Qi Methods. Agility is something that he specializes in. If you do this\u2026\u201d Han Yue hesitated for a moment before turning her head and softly speaking to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince the both of you have praised me all the way up to the sky in front of so many people, it would be my fault for appearing ordinary\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled. His gaze paused on Han Tian and said, \u201cMister Han Tian, please attack.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, good fellow. This arrogance can really compete with that Hong Chen. Alright, since you insist on doing so, I shall try and see how you will stop me from touching you within ten exchanges!\u201d Han Tian laughed loudly. He stepped forward and powerful Dou Qi surged from his body like floodwater. Immediately, numerous spiralling winds formed around him. The wild wind that howled, blew away the layer of dust on the ground of the hall.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Han Tian maneuvering his Dou Qi, Han Yue and Han Xue also hurriedly stepped back. They reminded Xiao Yan in a worried manner.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan tilted his head. However, his body did not move even a little. His sleeves fluttered under the wild wind that headed toward him, but his dark-black eyes had become exceptionally bright at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother Xiao Yan, you should be careful. This Nine Turning Wind Steps is a Dou Skill that gave me my reputation. Today, I shall display it. Do not blame me for bullying someone younger just because I am older.\u201d The dense wind lingered over Han Tian\u2019s legs as he softly cried out. Immediately, his feet stomped forward!</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>A wild wind was stirred after his footsteps fell. Han Tian\u2019s body instantly disappeared within the howling wind.</p><br/><p>A glow flashed across Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. In the next instant, his body suddenly stepped forward without any forewarning. Following the movement of his body, a hand that was wrapped by dense Dou Qi flew past him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat sharp perception!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFlowing wind second turn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprise immediately flashed across Han Tian\u2019s eyes after his first palm missed. Immediately, his feet swiftly formed two mysterious arcs, transforming his body into a spiraling wind that pounced toward Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan merely smiled in the face of Han Tian, who was closely following him. His feet landed on the ground and an explosion sounded under them. A pushing force caused Xiao Yan\u2019s body to shoot forward.</p><br/><p>Exploding Steps, Xiao Yan\u2019s first kind of agility Dou Skill. He had not displayed it for many years after gaining the Three Thousand Lightning Movement, Now that he had used it with his micro control, the effects were naturally not something that could be compared with back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird turn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan had just stabilized himself when a sudden sharp cry was suddenly emitted from behind him. A wild wind surged over.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s expression did not change. His right foot gently pressed on the ground. His toes adhered to the ground and swiftly slanted his body, narrowly dodging the attack that came from behind him.</p><br/><p>The entire interior of the hall was basically permeated by his Spiritual Strength. Even the slightest activity would be sensed by Xiao Yan. Although Han Tian\u2019s so-called Nine Turning Wind Steps was able to stir a wild wind that would hide his body, it was totally ineffective in the face of the probing Spiritual Strength. In other words, every single action of his was clearly imprinted in Xiao Yan\u2019s mind. In such a situation, it was easier said than done to strike Xiao Yan. Moreover, if one were to talk about the exquisiteness of ability, Han Tian had some gaps when compared to Xiao Yan\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cGood fellow, you do have some ability! Fourth turn!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Tian\u2019s expression also gradually became solemn after three of his attacks were narrowly dodged by Xiao Yan. He let out a deep cry and a dense-green-colored Dou Qi whistled and rotated over the surface of his body. A suction force surged out from within it, causing everyone in the hall to hurriedly step back.</p><br/><p>The suction force surged and the speed of Han Tian also greatly soared. With a \u2018xiu\u2019 sound, he transformed into a green glow that shot toward Xiao Yan. However, the latter dodged it once again with an angle that an ordinary person would not expect.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth turn!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSixth turn!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c...\u201d</p><br/><p>The battle within the hall became more and more intense. Han Tian\u2019s speed also became more and more frightening. In the end, almost no one, other than a couple of people, could see his figure. All they could sense was the suction force that repeatedly spread from the spiraling wind. Despite this being the case, the linen-clothed, young man\u2019s expression still remained calm. His footsteps would occasionally advance and occasionally withdraw or perhaps he would tilt sideways. Each slight movement enabled him to barely dodge Han Tian\u2019s attack\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cImpressive\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Xue\u2019s pretty face was filled with joy as she watched the relaxed Xiao Yan. She ended up involuntarily exclaiming in a soft voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is indeed very frightening. Looks like he has become much stronger during these years\u2026\u201d Han Yue also nodded slightly. Although Xiao Yan could fight with an expert Dou Huang in the past, he was far from this leisurely strolling manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis person is very strong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Chi looked at the dazzling exchange in the battleground. His face had also gradually turned solemn before he spoke in a deep voice a moment later.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he were to engage in a life and death battle with second brother, it is likely that second brother would be no match for him. According to my guess, this person might really be able to fight with Hong Chen.\u201d A man who looked somewhat similar to Han Chi slowly spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, let\u2019s continue watching and see if he is really able to completely dodge all of second brother\u2019s Nine Turning Wind Steps.\u201d Han Chi smiled and replied as his eyes watched the battle.</p><br/><p>......</p><br/><p>\u201cNine turns!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Tian\u2019s face had already turned green at this moment. A deep-green-colored spiraling wind wildly rotated under his feet. The hard ground was also cracked apart as he moved, revealing the soil under it.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiu!\u201d</p><br/><p>The green glow flashed across the large hall. In the end, however, it merely touched Xiao Yan\u2019s sleeves as it flew past.</p><br/><p>\u201cTen turns, Nine Wind Steps!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Tian suddenly let out a stern cry when his attack missed again. His body turned around and transformed into a wind. He took nine strides in a circle-like manner ten feet from Xiao Yan with lightning-like speed. Following the nine steps, nine deep-green-colored rotating winds appeared, completely sealing all of Xiao Yan\u2019s paths of retreat!</p><br/><p>\u201cJoin!\u201d</p><br/><p>Han Tian\u2019s hand seal moved and the nine spiraling winds immediately emitted a whirring wind sound. Immediately, they rotated in a wild manner and tore toward Xiao Yan in the middle.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis time around, I will see just how you dodge it!\u201d Han Tian laughed out loud at Xiao Yan who was sealed within the spiraling wind.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop!\u201d</p><br/><p>A soft cry was emitted from the middle of the nine spiraling winds the moment Han Tian\u2019s laughter sounded. Immediately, the space fluctuated slightly. The nine spiraling wind actually paused for an instant!</p><br/><p>The instant the spiraling winds paused, a silver glow flashed out in a lightning-like manner. It immediately transformed into a human figure that slowly appeared in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister Han, thank you for allowing me to win!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan cupped his hands together, grinned,and spoke to Han Tian, whose smile had already stiffened on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpatial Strength? You are an elite Dou Zong?\u201d</p><br/><p>After the dullness continued for a moment, shock suddenly surged onto Han Tian\u2019s face as he involuntarily cried out loud. The slight spatial distortion strength that Xiao Yan had used earlier to pause the spiraling wind was clearly the Spatial Strength that only an elite Dou Zong could use.</p><br/><p>Han Tian\u2019s face was not the only one which was shocked. Everyone in the hall, including Han Chi had stunned faces at this moment. Being an expert with half a foot in the Dou Zong class, he was even more sensitive to Spatial Strength. In that moment earlier, he was certain that Xiao Yan had indeed used a spatial distortion that only an elite Dou Zong could perform.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, mister Han Tian is mistaken. I have yet to reach that level. This Spatial Strength is something that I can barely use because of some lucky encounter. However, it can only perform some insignificant help.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head as he replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>The shock on everyone\u2019s faces was reduced only after hearing this. A twenty-year-old or so Dou Huang was already the limit that they could endure. If he was a Dou Zong, it was likely that anyone who saw him would say \u2018monster\u2019...</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle brother Xiao Yan is really humble. Spatial Strength is the indicator of an elite Dou Zong. Being able to control it with the strength of a Dou Huang is enough to shock people. I have lost this match. Ke ke, it is really the case of the new generation replacing the old. With your talent and ability, it is likely that you will be able to make a name for yourself even in this Central Plains\u2026\u201d Han Tian gently exhaled. His eyes suddenly landed on Han Xue and Han Yue. He smiled and said, \u201cThe eyesight of you two girls is also quite good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>These words, with a double meaning, caused these two ladies\u2019 pretty faces to instantly become fiery-red.</p><br/><p>Han Chi also laughed. His gaze slowly swept across Xiao Yan. Although he was wearing some ordinary linen clothes, this ordinary young man appeared like a sharp sword at this moment. Perhaps due to him having just fought with someone, he emitted a heavy pressurizing feeling that caused one to have difficulty underestimating him.</p><br/><p>Han Chi stood up, cupped his hands solemnly to Xiao Yan and said in a deep voice, \u201cBrother Xiao Yan, if the Han clan is able to survive the danger this time, the Han clan will never forget your favor!\u201d</p><br/><p>The many members of the Han clan behind Han Chi also stood up in unison with solemn faces. They cupped their hands together and bowed to Xiao Yan!</p><br/><p>Han Xue and Han Yue by the side exchanged glances before taking a step back and bowing slightly to Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan bitterly laughed in the face of such great courtesy. Looks like this matter was indeed extremely important to the Han clan. He could only sigh, cup his hands, and say in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan will definitely do his best!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Pink flames covered every part of his body. His skin, muscles, bones, cells\u2026 every part of Xiao Yan\u2019s body was filled by a pink flame at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi chi!\u201d</p><br/><p>The pink flames fiercely burned. While the flames wildly spread, his body became crystal clear. It was even possible to see his internal organs through the flames. These internal organs were covered by a pink crystal layer at this moment. The green-red wings on Xiao Yan\u2019s back slowly morphed. Finally, they turned into a pair of huge pink wings. Looking from a distance, it was as though they had been made by transparent glass, appearing exceptionally mysterious.</p><br/><p>The extermination fire body was a method of unleashing the energy of the Heavenly Flame to its limit by merging it with one\u2019s physical body. This required almost perfect control of the Heavenly Flame because the Heavenly Flames were far too ferocious. Even though it had already been refined, the inside of a human\u2019s body was still too weak. No one dared to easily use the Heavenly Flame to alter one\u2019s constitution. Even Xiao Yan did not dare to do so, but after Little Yi appeared, this kind of hidden danger completely vanished.</p><br/><p>Little Yi and Xiao Yan were mentally connected. They were just like one. Little Yi was the spirit of a Heavenly Flame. No one in the world could compare with him in terms of controlling a Heavenly Flame. The harsh conditions required to form the exterminating fire body could also be met by him.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Xiao Yan had used this skill after leaving the demonic flame realm, but he was confident in the might of the extermination fire body. From a certain point of view, this kind of extermination fire body was just transforming oneself into a movable extermination fire lotus, allowing his attacks to be as terrifying as the fire lotus\u2026 however, the only disadvantage was that the Dou Qi one required to use the extermination fire body was far too frightening. Even with Xiao Yan\u2019s current strength, it was likely that he would not be able to use it for more than a minute.</p><br/><p>One minute would pass in the blink of an eye. However, this one minute could decide the victor in a fight when it came to genuine experts.</p><br/><p>The extermination aura that suddenly rippled out of the formation was detected by many members of the ancient dragon tribe outside. Immediately, many surprised gazes were thrown at Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a frightening aura\u2026 in less than three years, his strength has actually progressed to such a level.\u201d Elder Zhu Li looked at Xiao Yan with an envious face. When he had first met Xiao Yan, he had still surpassed Xiao Yan slightly. Now, however, he had been tossed into some unknown corner.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like our Ancient Void Dragon tribe will be saved.\u201d The other Elders also revealed joyous faces. Originally, they thought that it was impossible to stop the crazy northern dragon king even with Xiao Yan\u2019s appearance. However, Xiao Yan caused them to rejoice.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan, who had been observing the situation in front of everyone, revealed joy in her eyes. The aura that had suddenly erupted from Xiao Yan caused her to feel reassured.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi, someone who only knows how to put up a mystifying act. No one can change your fate today!\u201d</p><br/><p>The northern dragon king narrowed his scarlet eyes as Xiao Yan transformed. He let out a laugh. Although he spoke in a condescending manner, the caution in his heart greatly soared. The current Xiao Yan already made him feel some danger. He would have to pay an extremely miserable price if he was careless. His blood-colored hand quickly formed a seal as he cried out, \u201cBlood dragon, devour the sky!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d</p><br/><p>The huge blood formation suddenly churned after the northern dragon king\u2019s cry sounded. An immeasurable amount of bloody Dou Qi gathered in the air above the northern dragon king. It vaguely formed a savage blood dragon that was larger than the entire dragon island. A voice filled with a violent and murderous desire slowly rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang bang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Many ancient dragon figures exploded within the dragon island after the bloody Dou Qi gathered. They turned into blood fog that was absorbed into the blood dragon, causing its body to grow a brighter red.</p><br/><p>On the other side of the blood formation, Cai Lin continued to rapidly throw members of the ancient dragon tribe out of the blood formation. Even though she was quick, many still exploded into a bloody mist. She knit her delicate brows and waved her hand. Ten seven-colored lights erupted from her. The rate she was rescuing those individuals soared.</p><br/><p>\u201cTsk tsk, the Transforming Dragon Demon Formation can be considered the ultimate skill of my ancient dragon tribe. Those pieces of trash actually thought of destroying it? They were really extremely foolish!\u201d</p><br/><p>The madness on the face of the northern dragon king became even denser as he stared at the incomparably large blood dragon in the sky. He glanced at Xiao Yan a short distance in front of him. His body rose and finally turned into a blood glow that charged into the huge mouth of the blood dragon.</p><br/><p>After the northern dragon king charged into the blood dragon\u2019s body, the luster radiating from all parts of the blood dragon gathered on him. A dim blood light lingered around the surface of his body. Those huge dragon scales flicked with a chilling luster, giving them a life-like appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d</p><br/><p>The blood dragon\u2019s huge eyes contained an endless bloody aura as they focused on Xiao Yan in an icy and merciless fashion. The incomparably large body trembled as it opened its ferocious large mouth. A ten-thousand-foot-large blood glow that contained a bloody aura, which caused one\u2019s expression to change, rushed toward Xiao Yan like a furious dragon.</p><br/><p>\u201cBe careful!\u201d</p><br/><p>The blood light shot out as Zi Yan warned Xiao Yan. She could sense a frightening force in the blood light. If someone were struck by it, even an elite five star Dou Sheng would likely suffer a serious injury.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, Xiao Yan, since you have delivered yourself to me, I shall help take your life!\u201d</p><br/><p>The northern dragon king\u2019s proud roar reverberated across the empty realm as he watched the blood light penetrate the void.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes were slowly opened as he faced the northern dragon king\u2019s roar. Both of his black eyes became crystal clear, but the fire lotus within his body rotated in a terrifying way.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch strength\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lowered his head and swiftly observed his current situation. His pink glass-like face revealed his intoxication. He was currently the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame!</p><br/><p>If he possessed sufficient Dou Qi, Xiao Yan could even unleash the destructive might of the Purifying Demonic Lotus Flame. He could burn mountains and boil the sea by just raising his hand!</p><br/><p>There was no limit to this Heavenly Flame. Both man and flame had completely merged together\u2026 the only person across the entire Dou Qi continent who could reach this level was just Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>An incomparably searing hot aura was slowly spat from Xiao Yan\u2019s mouth. He lifted his head and glanced at the blood light rapidly magnifying in his eyes. The corners of his mouth were curled. However, he did not prepare any defenses. The fire wings on his back were gently flapped. After which, he turned into a fire meteorite in front of many shocked eyes. He collided head-on with the blood light.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi!\u201d</p><br/><p>They collided at that moment, but everyone\u2019s eyes shrunk as the bloody light, which was filled with a frightening bloody energy that could easily defeat a a five star Dou Sheng, quickly dimmed upon contact\u2026</p><br/><p>Everyone\u2019s eyes watched as the light that had penetrated through the void swiftly weakened the moment of the collision. Moreover, it started to slowly deform as it weakened at a shocking speed. A falling-star-like figure flashed with lightning-like speed at the same time\u2026</p><br/><p>The blood light collapsed with just a touch when the two made contact!</p><br/><p>Moreover, it had collapsed without any resistance!</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>The blood light finally became illusory in front of the eyes of the blood dragon, which was filled with disbelief. The fire light figure continued to fly over like a falling star. It was swiftly magnified in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis king will not fail!\u201d</p><br/><p>Up against Xiao Yan\u2019s wild and violent attack, a crazy expression began to surge within the eyes of the blood dragon that the northern dragon king had merged with. He was all alone already. If he were to lose, he would no longer find an opportunity to turn things around!</p><br/><p>\u201cRoar!\u201d</p><br/><p>A glaring blood light crazily erupted from the blood dragon\u2019s enormous body. It gathered within its large ferocious mouth at a shocking speed. Finally, it turned into a dark five-foot-large bead condensed from blood. The surface of the bloody bead was covered in lines that appeared like blood vessels. An incomparably bloody scent spread through the Empty Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwoosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The blood bead had just appeared when the craziness within the northern dragon king\u2019s eyes surged. He ruthlessly shot the bead at Xiao Yan in front of him. The blood dragon immediately began to crumble after the blood bead shot away, as though all of its energy had left with the blood bead\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cDragon Soul Bead! This bastard didn't even let off the souls of the tribe members!\u201d The eyes of those Ancient Void Dragons outside of the blood formation quickly turned a bloody red after catching sight of the blood-colored bead. The northern dragon king had not only devoured the flesh of many from the tribe, he had also not let off their souls.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan\u2019s delicate figure trembled.. The murderous desire within her eyes was extremely dense.</p><br/><p>The northern dragon king did not care about the fury of the others. His scarlet eyes continued to stare at Xiao Yan who flying over. Xiao Yan then collided with the blood bead. A cruel and savage smile was immediately lifted on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, go and die!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

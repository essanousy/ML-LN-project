A moment later, they paused just beyond the edge of the mountain road where a gate was situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is it? This place is my Demon Blade Gate\u2019s mountain gate. All passerby should hurry up and leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Over a dozen people guarding the mountain quickly lifted their ghost blades in their hands after this group of somewhat strange individuals paused in front of the gate. A fierce glint flashed across their eyes as they spoke in a stern voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Black-Corner Region is beyond this place, right?\u201d The leader of the group of black robed individual spoke in a faint elderly voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph, since you are aware that it is the Black-Corner Region, why don\u2019t you hurry up and get lost? This is not a place that anyone can simply barge in!\u201d A strong man at the gate, who appeared to be the leader, let out a cold snort.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like we have come to the right place\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader involuntarily laughed after hearing this. He slowly lifted his head and revealed an indifferent face under those black robes. His bone like hand was extended from his sleeve as he spoke in an indifferent voice, \u201cKill them. Leave no one alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dozens of figures behind immediately replied in a deep voice after he opened his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSwoosh swoosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The person at the mountain gate became cautious after the old man opened his mouth. After which, a warning bamboo whistle was swiftly emitted from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you act presumptuously in front of my Demon Blade Gate\u2026\u201d The warning bamboo whistled was emitted. Before that person could finish his cold cry, however, a black figure was magnified in his eyes. In the next moment, his body had actually exploded into a cluster of blood. At the same time, the mountain gate behind him was also blasted into dust.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn enemy attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>This sudden explosion resounded over the mountain. Immediately, the sound of rushing wind sounded. Thousands of figures rushed out from the mountain. They held large blades in their hands, which had a densely cold luster under the sunlight.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually dare come to my Demon Blade Gate to cause trouble. It seems that you have some ability!\u201d</p><br/><p>A figure holding a large blade slowly walked forward from amongst the man people. However, his powerful aura, which could match an expert Dou Huang, had just surged when the black clothed figure flashed and appeared in front of him in a ghost like fashion. The latter\u2019s sleeve was gently waved and this well known expert Dou Huang in the Black-Corner Region, was blasted into a bloody fog in front of the many stunned gazes.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill all of them. Additionally, send the information to the other units to attack. I hope that only our people will remain in this Black-Corner Region after today.\u201d The black robed leader spoke in an indifferent manner after blasting apart this Demon Blade Gate\u2019s chief with the shake of his sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnderstood!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dozens of black figures once again replied after hearing his words. In the next instant, monstrous Dou Qi erupted from them. Black chains cut through the air and a slaughter was being enacted.</p><br/><p>Today was the joyous day when another batch of new students was going to enter the Jia Nan Academy and its older students being promoted to the Inner Academy. Hence, the academy had held a ceremony. The entire academy was currently filled with a joyous atmosphere.</p><br/><p>The open ground where the ceremony was held was basically filled with people. Many chaotic voices gathered together and charge to the cloud.</p><br/><p>There was a couple of large combat stage placed at the middle of the open ground. At this moment, Dou Qi continued to burst from the combat stage. Human figures crossed each other. Their sparring appeared unusually fiery hot and intense. The occasional victor would stand proudly, attracting the eyes of many young ladies.</p><br/><p>The entire academy was currently filled with the liveliness that the youth ought to have.</p><br/><p>Two huge stone statue stood at the middle of the couple of combat stages. One of them was that of an old man while the other appeared young and handsome. The age of that young man seemed to be similar to that of the students. This situation had attracted some doubts of the new entrants of the academy.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior sister, one of those two statues belong to the legendary headmaster but who does the other one belong to? He doesn\u2019t appear very old.\u201d A couple of young ladies, who were filled with liveliness surrounded a tall and beautiful lady as they curiously asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is the most outstanding person of the Jia Nan Academy. Do you know about the Pan Gate and Xiao Gate? They were founded by this senior. The reason that you are able to successfully pass through the Black-Corner Region when heading here is because of the Xiao Gate\u2019s prestige. If it was in the past, there would have been some new students dying in the Black-Corner Region every year. All of you have experienced the ferocity of that place.\u201d The tall young lady\u2019s pretty eyes contained a strange expression as they looked at the huge statue and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe appears to be extremely mighty? Hee hee, where is this senior currently at?\u201d A young lady laughingly asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has long since left the Jia Nan Academy. The last time around, I had heard the Elders say that the senior has headed to the Central Plains. That is a place that is said to be filled with experts. Hence, all of you should forget about your wishful thinking\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is also senior sister\u2019s thoughts right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are asking for a beating\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian on the towering stage looked at the lively atmosphere on the open ground. His elderly face had a small smile on it. After which, he lifted his head and looked at the two statue on the open ground. He involuntarily shook his head. It had been decades since he had met these two right?</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how that fellow Xiao Yan is now? Given his talent and ability, it is likely that his achievement would be quite great\u2026\u201d Su Qian muttered to himself. During these many years, the Jia Nan Academy had recruited many extremely outstanding individuals. However, all of them were a little inferior if they were compared with the young man from back then.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst Elder Su Qian.\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice was suddenly transmitted from behind while Su Qian spoke. He turned around and involuntarily smiled.</p><br/><p>There were three figures behind Su Qian. They were two ladies and a man. One of the lady was wearing an instructor robes. Even though the clothes appeared formal and large, it was unable to hide her graceful delicate body, especially those rare long and sexy legs, which had attracted the eyes of many.</p><br/><p>The other lady was wearing a red dress. A whip was placed on her waist. Her pretty faced caused some students to be afraid of taking another look. Who was unaware of the fierce reputation of the demon female instructor Hu Jia in this academy. Anyone who was targeted by her would be going to have a hard time.</p><br/><p>There was a man beside the two of them. His expression was indifferent. On his back was a huge heavy sword. If one stood closer to him, one would feel a suffocating aura pouncing onto them.</p><br/><p>The three of them could be considered to be the most outstanding individuals in the Jia Nan Academy. If Xiao Yan was present, he would be able to recognise these three familiar faces.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yu, Hu Jia and Wu Hao.</p><br/><p>The three of them were already considered the backbone strength of the current Jia Nan Academy. Xiao Yu had advanced into the Dou Zong class two years ago while Hu Jia had reached the peak of the Dou Zong class. It was only a matter of time before they stepped into the Dou Zun class.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you thinking of that fellow again? Chi, it has been so many years. I wondered if he had managed to catch Xun Er\u2026\u201d Hu Jia sat down beside Su Qian in a grand fashion. She glanced at Xiao Yan\u2019s statue, curled her mouth and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can be rest assured that his achievement is definitely at a level that we cannot even compare with.\u201d Wu Hao revealed a smile. It seemed as though he had recalled the time back then when the four of them had formed a group to snatch Fire Energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlah, I will be able to reach the Dou Zun class this year.\u201d Hu Jia said.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe had already dared to fight against the Dou Zun class ten years ago.\u201d Xiao Yu by the side smiled sweetly. Her pretty eyes looked towards the statue. There was a complicated emotion flowing in her eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe both of you can just speak for him. It is not as though he can hear what you say.\u201d Hu Jia spoke somewhat bitterly after hearing this.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have already grown so big but you are still behaving like you did back then.\u201d Su Qian smiled. He looked at the instructors and Elders gradually filling up the surrounding seats before slowly standing up.</p><br/><p>The originally noisey open ground had quickly become much quieter as he stood up. Many pairs of eyes paused on him. Currently, Su Qian was undoubtedly the true person in charge of the Jia Nan Academy. Mang Tian Chi, was far too irresponsible as the person-in-charge. Even some of the instructors had nearly forgotten his name.</p><br/><p>\u201cEvery\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian, who had stood up, looked at the many young and tender faces. He involuntarily let out a warm smile. However, he was about to speak when he suddenly frowned. His eyes leaped over the sea of people and looked at the horizon. There was some intense rushing wind sound being emitted from the spot. A bloody killing aura accompanied this sound.</p><br/><p>\u201cWu Hao.\u201d</p><br/><p>After having managed the academy for so many years, Su Qian had already become as calm as a mountain. He immediately spoke in a calm manner.</p><br/><p>\u201cLaw Enforcement Unit. All Elder, be alert!\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Hao immediately stood up. His body slowly rose into the sky and spoke in a deep voice.</p><br/><p>Rushing wind sound appeared from the seats and the academy after his voice sounded. Many figures quickly appeared around the open ground. Their eyes were cautious as they looked at the sky.</p><br/><p>This sudden scene had also greatly startled these students. However, they did not turn into an uproar after being calmed down by the many instructors.</p><br/><p>The rushing wind sound became increasingly loud as everyone were became alert. A moment later, a large group of black shadows appeared in the horizon. Within a couple of flashes, they appeared in the sky above this place.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday is a joyous festive of our Jia Nan Academy and it is inconvenient for us to receive outsiders. I hope that all of you can forgive us.\u201d Su Qian looked at those black figures in the sky and frowned slightly. He could sense a dense bloody scent from these people. His heart immediately sunk. It seemed that the friendly individuals would not come and those who did so would not be friendly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFestive?\u201d</p><br/><p>The leader involuntarily smiled slightly after hearing Su Qian\u2019s words. He slowly pulled open the cloak and revealed a shrivelled face. He glance at Su Qian. His voice contained a trace of ripple as he said, \u201cBring everyone and leave the Black-Corner Region in two hours. Is this enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFriend, one should not be joking in such a manner.\u201d Everyone\u2019s expression had changed at this moment as Su Qian opened his mouth and spoke in a deep voice. If it was not because he could not clearly detect the strength of this person, he would have likely already attack in anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it is insufficient, all I can do is to kill all of you. Although you consist of children, we do not have any choice\u2026\u201d The black robed old man spoke in an indifferent voice.</p><br/><p>There was a fury leaping within everyone\u2019s eyes after hearing his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Hun You, that statue, it looks like that brat Xiao Yan!\u201d A person beside the black robed old man in the sky suddenly pointed towards the statue below and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? That Xiao Yan who have destroyed my Hall of Soul?\u201d The expression of the old man, who was called Hun You, immediately became gloomy. He densely stared at the statue and immediately let out a strange laughter, \u201cOriginally, I was planning on retaining some kindness. However, it is unexpected that a statue of that person is located here. Since this is the case, it looks like I must turn this place into a bloodbath!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen up, turn this place into a bloodbath. Do not allow anyone of them to remain!\u201d</p><br/><p>A monstrous murderous aura quickly rose and spread in the sky after Hun You\u2019s voice sounded!</p><br/><p>[a]He should be a one star Dou Zun</p><br/>\n</div>"}

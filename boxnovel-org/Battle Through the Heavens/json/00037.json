And the vitality of the clan is the clan\u2019s younger generation, the \u201cnew blood\u201d of the clan. Only with a continuous supply of \u201cnew blood\u201d can a clan, a huge \u201cmachine\u201d, run smoothly.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the Coming of Age Ceremony, is a huge day for every clan, including the Xiao Clan.</p><br/><p>As one of the top three clans in Wu Tan City, Xiao Clan\u2019s Coming of Age Ceremony attracted the attention of most forces in the city and those that had a good relationship with Xiao Clan even came to watch the ceremony.</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>Accompanying Xun Er under the shade of a large true, Xiao Yan relaxingly sat.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes while looking at the huge platform in the middle of the training field. The platform was made of huge blocks of lumber and was specially made for the Coming of Age Ceremony that was about to happen.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze left the empty wooden platform and went to the people that were not part of Xiao Clan but still there to witness the Coming of Age Ceremony. With reluctance, he said: \u201cThere are quite a few people\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Watching Xiao Yan\u2019s unhappy face, Xun Er, who knew that Xiao Yan liked serenity, gloated with laughter.</p><br/><p>Just as her laugh sounded, Xun Er felt Xiao Yan\u2019s accusing gaze and quickly closed her mouth. Taking a look at Xiao Yan, her eyes had a hint of light gold flash across before she said: \u201cXiao Yan ge-ge got to 8 Duan Qi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Xiao Yan tilted his head to look at her and realized that while being around Xun Er, he couldn\u2019t keep any secrets. With a depressed heart, he feebly nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cWoah\u2026 not even a month had passed and you already got to 8 Duan Qi. This speed\u2026 is quite scary.\u201d Seeing Xiao Yan nod, even with Xun Er\u2019s calm nature, she showed a face of surprise.</p><br/><p>Giving her a white eye to Xun Er, Xiao Yan\u2019s face suddenly turned. Near the wooden platform, there was a woman that was wrapped in a red dress and was chatting with the people besides her. A circle of people surrounded her, making the spot where she was at, the most popular circle around the platform.</p><br/><p>This red dressed woman that was attracting everyone was someone that Xiao Yan had seen before! She was the top auctioneer of the Primer Auction house, Ya Fei!</p><br/><p>With his gaze lingering the water-snake like waist of Ya Fei, Xiao Yan gave his opinion silently: \u201cReally pretty!\u201d</p><br/><p>After Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze had stayed on Ya Fei for a while, Xun Er\u2019s unhappy hump came from besides him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhem\u2026\u201d With his eyes blinking, Xiao Yan slowly retracted his gaze to act as if he wasn\u2019t staring at Ya Fei and smiled to the unhappy Xun Er: \u201cDid you know that the Primer Auction House came to our clan\u2019s Coming of Age Ceremony?\u201d</p><br/><p>Giving an evil stare to Xiao Yan who was acting as if nothing had happened, Xun Er emotionlessly said: \u201cXiao Clan and the Primer Auction House have always had a good relation so why is Ya Fei coming such a big deal? In addition, this woman\u2019s communication skills are confirmed incredible by all of Wu Tan City. A couple of young masters that befriended her for her beauty have spent an incredible amount of money on her but in the end, they got nothing. If Xiao Yao ge-ge wants to try to charm her then I can only say be careful. And, Xun Er won\u2019t lend you any money for those things.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Xiao Yan bitterly smiled: \u201cEven if I\u2019m thinking about those things, it requires that she, at the very least, acknowledges me. You do realize that she\u2019s at least 7 to 8 years older than me right?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t some women like that?\u201d Xun Er seemingly smiled while saying that.</p><br/><p>Dryly coughing, Xiao Yan could only admit defeat and not look at that circle of people again.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh, why is she back?\u201d Seeing that Xiao Yan wasn\u2019t looking over there anymore, Xun Er stopped pursuing the point and after a brief moment of silence, she exclaimed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho?\u201d After following Xun Er\u2019s gaze, Xiao Yan\u2019s brows slowly furrowed.</p><br/><p>The gaze of the two pointed to a girl that was wearing a school uniform and was currently leaning on a tree. She had a sword equipped at her waist, was quite tall and the most striking feature were her long legs, legs that were so sexy that even Ya Fei\u2019s legs paled in comparison to hers.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Ye?\u201d While staring at the tall girl, Xiao Yan asked: \u201cDidn\u2019t she go to Jia Nan Academy to train? Why did she come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xun Er cutely shrugged her shoulder while teasing: \u201cXiao Yan ge-ge, this time, you might have some trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Cracking open his mouth, Xiao Yan rubbed his burning forehead while saying: \u201cThis unruly woman is so annoying. Dammit, all I did was accidentally stumble into her bathing spot in the back mountains and accidentally touch her legs. She tried killing me for the majority of a year after that!\u201d</p><br/><p>TL: Killing is used in joking manner, it means like severe beating in this context</p><br/><p>\u201cHehe, a girl\u2019s body isn\u2019t meant to be touched carelessly.\u201d Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s story, Xun Er covered her mouth as she giggled. Suddenly, she remembered how Xiao Yan had helped her during the night and during that time, had contact with her body, causing a red blush to appear on her face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan pursed his lips while coldly smiling: \u201cThat woman is Xiao Ning\u2019s sister and they both aren\u2019t good people. That bastard\u2019s enmity towards me is partly due to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Far away, Xiao Yu seemed to have sensed the two talking about her and turned around to find Xiao Yan under another tree. After a slight shock, she furrowed her brows as distaste and disdain surfaced on her face.</p><br/><p>After a pause, Xiao Yu moved her attractive long legs and started walking towards Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yu coming over, Xiao Yan\u2019s brows also furrowed as he showed his disgust and impatience.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa, Xiao Yan, I never thought that I would see the day that you turn your situation around. It\u2019s really surprising.\u201d Coming closer, Xiao Yu saw Xiao Yan undisguised dislike towards her and sneered.</p><br/><p>\u201cNone of your business.\u201d</p><br/><p>Obviously, Xiao Yan wasn\u2019t too pleased with Xiao Yu and his normal calm had been abandoned with his vulgar words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour words are still sharp and annoying as ever. Looks like the three years of abjection didn\u2019t smooth out your sharp vigor.\u201d Xiao Yu looked down upon Xiao Yan and said in a teaching tone.</p><br/><p>This tone again\u2026 While letting out an annoyed breath in his mind, Xiao Yan looked down and closely examined this girl that he had not seen for almost an year. Moving his gaze to her legs, Xiao Yao touched his nose while asking: \u201cYour legs are still that long. I wonder if another male touched them after that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Xiao Yu who was sneering, stopped, as her face darkened.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His eyes moved to Xiao Yan by the side and laughed, \u201cGood name. It is likely that the position of this Yan Alliance in the future will far surpass the Misty Cloud Sect. Hopefully, there will be a seat for the Jia Ma Empire in the northwestern region in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>XIao Yan nodded with a smile and softly replied, \u201cXiao Yan will naturally do my best.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, since this alliance has been established, we will naturally need a leader who will lead everyone\u2026\u201d Fa Ma stood up and smiled as he said, \u201cIt seems that this position will definitely belong to little friend Xiao Yan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mu Chen, Nalan Jie, and the others hurriedly voiced their agreement after hearing Fa Ma\u2019s words. After Xiao Yan had spent so much time and effort to establish a faction, these people would naturally not naively think that he was impartial. The position of the Alliance Chief was naturally encapsulated within it. Naturally, there would not be anyone who would foolishly voice any opposition in this kind of situation.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled in the face of this agreement. He did not purposefully put up an act to decline it. Instead, he got up and laughed, \u201cThe Yan Alliance does not belong to Xiao Yan alone. Its future achievements still need to rely on all the founding members seated here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded upon seeing that everything was progressing as he had expected. He waved his hand and the female servants by the side served some wine that had already been poured in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe formation of the alliance today can be considered a big matter. Let\u2019s all have a drink for the Yan Alliance!\u201d Xiao Ding raised his wine cup and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha. Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!\u201d</p><br/><p>The largest faction within the Jia Ma Empire was finally established amid the laughter in the hall. Perhaps in a short while, this new faction would be mentioned by the mouths of every single person from the Jia Ma Empire. Many people would know that this faction would be the replacement of the Misty Cloud Sect!</p><br/><p>Whether this replacement would walk even further than the Misty Cloud Sect would be determined by what abilities its leader possessed!</p><br/><p>Everyone left one after another after the discussion in the hall was completed. The serious atmosphere of the hall slowly became a relaxing one.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also let out a long breath when he saw the last person out of the Xiao Mansion. He sat in his chair and sighed, \u201cI have finally settled this. In the future, our Xiao clan can be considered to have a protection that is reassuring.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGiven your current strength, you can just forcefully order them to join. Yet you want to make it this troublesome. You really are seeking your own bitterness.\u201d Queen Medusa who had been quiet until this moment finally glanced at Xiao Yan and coldly spoke.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan rolled his eyes upon hearing this. He was too lazy to be bothered reasoning with her. In the heart of this vicious woman, strength was the greatest, no matter what kind of topic it was.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Yan Alliance involves all of the strongest factions within the empire after it has just been established. Its potential is extraordinary. In the future, I will make the information network of the Yan Alliance spread over every single corner of the empire. At that time, anyone who is against our Xiao clan will enter into our ears. Even if that \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019 wants to touch the members of our Xiao clan again, it would no longer be as easy as it was in the past.\u201d Xiao Ding ignored the argument between the two as he laughed faintly and spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t we giving them too much authority in this Yan Alliance? The Elder\u2019s Council can decide the Alliance Chief\u2019s will. This might be a lot of trouble if it is not handled well in the future.\u201d Xiao Li knit his brows and gave his input.</p><br/><p>\u201cRelax, I am only doing this to stabilize their hearts. Once more time passes and the concept of their clans fade in their hearts, they will naturally begin to place the alliance as the priority. Moreover, I will also quietly use some tactics to cause most of the people in our Elder\u2019s Council to be made up of people from our Xiao clan and those that support our Xiao clan. In the future, there will definitely be no one interfering with any decision that third brother makes.\u201d Xiao Ding knocked his hand against his legs and carelessly laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled. He stretched his lazy waist and said, \u201cNow that the alliance has been successfully established, I will hand the subsequent matters to big brother and second brother to settle. I am not very good at this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou brat\u2026\u201d Xiao Ding helplessly shook his head when he saw that XIao Yan had already began to shirk his responsibilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, second brother, have you found all the medicinal ingredients that I got you to look for?\u201d Xiao Yan appeared to have suddenly recalled something as he inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Primer clan has managed to dispatch the list of these medicinal ingredients to all its auction houses. They have gathered all the medicinal ingredients but there is only enough to refine two medicinal pills. If you fail, it is likely that they will need to spend two months in order to continue gathering all of them. Old Hai said that these medicinal ingredients were far too rare. Even the Primer clan does not keep much of them around.\u201d Xiao Li was startled when he heard the question. His gaze swept over Xiao Ding without leaving a trace as he immediately replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo sets huh.., it should be enough to refine one pill. You should deliver the medicinal ingredients to my chamber later.\u201d Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment. Two sets of medicinal ingredients was indeed a little risky. However, the little life that Xiao Li currently had left did not allow him to delay any longer. Hence, Xiao Yan immediately opened his mouth to reply.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li slightly nodded.</p><br/><p>No doubt was aroused in Xiao Ding\u2019s heart when the two of them were discussing the medicinal ingredients. After all, it was extremely natural for Xiao Yan to refine medicinal pills since he was an alchemist. Hence, their eyes glanced at the pretty, cold face of Medusa by the side after the two of them finished their conversation. Xiao Ding immediately gave Xiao Li a look before having him push his wheelchair out of the hall.</p><br/><p>They looked\u2026 looked\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head when he saw the actions of the two of them. He immediately threw his gaze toward Medusa. After being silent for a moment, he softly said, \u201cThank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>This thanks was naturally because she was willing to come and hold the fort for him. Medusa was the best choice if he wanted to deter and shake those old fellows. However, her character was too cold. Xiao Yan was also prepared to be rejected when he invited her to help. He did not expect that the other party would agree in such a crisp fashion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI only wanted to come and kill. Unfortunately, things did not go as I hoped.\u201d Medusa merely responded faintly in the face of Xiao Yan\u2019s thanks. However, even she might have sensed her ice-cold pupils become a little gentler at this moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan, the Yaowan that you have given me has long been finished. Now that your injuries have completely recovered, you should hurry and refine some more for me.\u201d Zi Yan, who had been following beside Medusa immediately muttered.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled as he stepped forward and gently rubbed Zi Yan\u2019s head. He agreed with a faint grin, \u201cAlright, I will refine for you in awhile, you little greedy fellow.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should be quick. I can sense that I seemed to be about to become stronger again and require a large amount of energy. Otherwise, I am about to fall into a slumber.\u201d Zi Yan knit her little brows. Ever since she had blocked that blow from Protector Wu on the Misty Cloud Mountain, she faintly began to feel a strange feeling. Hence, she was anxiously in need of a large amount of energy.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan and Medusa were startled when they heard this. Their eyes immediately revealed a curious glow as they looked at Zi Yan. A moment later, they exchanged looks with one another and said in surprise, \u201cIt seems that she is about to advance?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan mused for a moment. Zi Yan was at the Dou Wang class when he had first met her in the Inner Academy back then. According to the rank of a Magical Beast, it was only natural for a rank 5 Magical Beast to advance after having eaten so many natural treasures.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe advancement of a Magical Beast will require an unusually large amount of energy. Hence, an ordinary Magical Beast that advances would first find various kinds of natural treasures. However, this girl has been eating countless numbers of treasures for so many years and only advanced now. It seems that the energy she needs to advance is indeed massive. I really don\u2019t know what kind of being she is\u2026\u201d Medusa\u2019s tone also carried some surprise. It was also the first time that she had seen a Magical Beast require such a large amount of energy to advance. Normally speaking, the greater the energy needed during the advancement, the stronger the Magical Beast. However, someone like Zi Yan\u2026 seemed to require so much that it was a little overboard.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can rest assured that I will help her obtain it no matter how great the amount of energy she requires. This little fellow has followed me and run out of the Inner Academy. I cannot allow her to be injured. Otherwise, I would have difficulty accounting to First Elder Su Qin in the future.\u201d Xiao Yan pinched Zi Yan\u2019s tender jade-like little face. He could not help but laugh gently when he saw the cute manner of the latter in which she repeatedly swung her face to avoid his hand.</p><br/><p>Medusa was also startled when she saw the gentleness that Xiao Yan displayed at this moment. She immediately said in a faint manner, \u201cThis little fellow is very close to me. I will not agree even if you allow her to be injured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan helplessly shook his head upon seeing Medusa appeared to be protecting the child. He seemed to have recalled something as he raised his eyes and looked at Medusa. He softly said, \u201cOur one year agreement will arrive after one to two months.\u201d</p><br/><p>Medusa\u2019s hand that was helping comb Zi Yan\u2019s purple hair stilled. Her pretty face, that was showing signs of a gentleness earlier, slowly turned icy-cold. Those eyes that were filled with a bewitching charm glanced at Xiao Yan. Her voice was indifferent as she said, \u201cDon\u2019t you know that you will definitely be the first person to die in my hands once I consume the \u2018Soul Recovery Pill\u2019? Or do you think that the current you can contend with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed bitterly and said, \u201cI am naturally aware of this. However, there is an agreement and I will naturally not break the agreement. Moreover, from the way you are gathering medicinal ingredients from all over the place, it seems that you are also really looking forward to it. Don\u2019t tell me that I can actually ignore it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Medusa\u2019s eyes were ice-cold as she glanced at Xiao Yan. She immediately pulled Zi Yan\u2019s little hands, turned her body and walked out of the hall. Only when she reach the doorway did she pause her footsteps and speak in a faint voice, \u201cThose medicinal ingredients have all been eaten by Zi Yan. If you are really anxious to refine the medicinal ingredients, there is no need to go to the trouble. You can just tell me and I will strike you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, don\u2019t think that this Queen has a change of heart. It is just that I wish to allow you to live for a little longer.\u201d</p><br/><p>A stunned look appeared in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes after he heard Queen Medusa throw these words out before leaving the hall. A strange expression covered his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis woman\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

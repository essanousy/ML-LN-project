Old Acquaintance!</u></strong></p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s group was coming increasingly closer to their destination after two long months of flying. According to what the map indicated, they would soon be able to reach the border of the Jia Ma Empire\u2026</p><br/><p>Time flowed by amid this dull flying. When the endless, long journey once again passed through a majestic mountain range, the large outline of a fortress faintly appeared at the edge of their sight.</p><br/><p>The fortress was built against the mountains, appearing much like a ferocious tiger that guarded the key route that led from the empire to its exterior. Anyone who wanted to leave the Jia Ma Empire must pass through this enormous fortress. This heavily guarded fortress had swallowed an unknown number of ghosts. They were the ghosts of people who died on the battlefield during these years. This had also caused many empires around to fear it like one feared a tiger.</p><br/><p>Hence this fortress had a rather fierce name.</p><br/><p>Zhen Gui Pass! (Ghost Crushing Pass)</p><br/><p>A smile slowly solidified on Xiao Yan\u2019s face as his gaze swept toward the outline of the enormous fortress in the distant horizon. He stood up on the enormous head of the Tiger Eagle Beast and looked down on the city fortress that still emitted a ghastly aura despite being a great distance away. A moment later, a smile surfaced on the corner of his mouth and swiftly widened. Finally, a roaring laughter that had been suppressed for three years sounded like thunder in the sky!</p><br/><p>\u201cJia Ma Empire, I, Xiao Yan\u2026 has returned!\u201d</p><br/><p>The loud laughter rolled like a thunder in the sky. However, there was usually hardly anyone in this location. Otherwise, he would definitely have attracted the gazes of a countless number of people.</p><br/><p>The people on the ten plus flying beasts watched Xiao Yan who seldom forget himself as they threw their surprised gazes over. This was the first time they had seen Xiao Yan, this person who had always maintained a warm smile and never appeared to be flustered, forgetting himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this place the Jia Ma Empire?\u201d Lin Yan and the others stood at the front somewhat curiously. Their gaze looked toward the extremely distant fortress and inquired.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes. This is a border fortress of the Jia Ma Empire. We can be considered to have entered the Jia Ma Empire once we pass through this place.\u201d Xiao Li nodded and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack then, I fled from this place when I was chased by the Misty Cloud Sect. It is really unexpected that I would return to this spot three years later.\u201d The wild smile on Xiao Yan\u2019s face was slowly withdrawn. He turned his head toward Lin Yan and others to speak with a grin. That smile had a nostalgic feeling to it.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, if that is the case, what are we waiting for?\u201d Xiao Li smiled. He patted Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders. Back then, Xiao Yan had escaped alive while being chased by the Misty Cloud Sect, who wanted to kill him. This matter had turned the Jia Ma Empire into an uproar back then. The various thrills involved were far more exciting and dangerous compared to what was transmitted out.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also laughed softly. His long hand was extended from his sleeves and a glow flashed from the \u2018Serene Sea Storage Ring\u2019. An enormous dark-black heavy ruler appeared with a flash.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if there is anyone within the Jia Ma Empire who is still currently able to recall this image?\u201d The Heavy Xuan Ruler was placed on Xiao Yan\u2019s back as he patted it and laughed. Its large size was nearly as tall as Xiao Yan\u2019s height.</p><br/><p>Lin Yan and the others watched that black-robed, young man who was carrying a black ruler with his hands behind his back as he stood on the head of the Tiger Eagle Beast. They suddenly vaguely sensed a sharp killing intent gradually being emitted from the body of this usually gentle fellow. The few of them exchanged glances. In their hearts, all of them quietly mentioned that the Jia Ma Empire would become a little chaotic because of this fellow return...</p><br/><p>\u201cEveryone, increase our speed!\u201d Xiao Yan gently waved his hand as his voice clearly resounded by everyone\u2019s ears. That tone which had always been as gentle as a breeze gained an additional anxiety at this moment.</p><br/><p>An acknowledgement sounded in the sky upon hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s orders. Immediately the ten plus flying beasts flapped their flesh wings amid some roars, carrying along a wild wind as they rushed toward the distant fortress.</p><br/><p>Although the distance appeared to to extremely far, Xiao Yan and the others were already in close proximity of the fortress after less than ten minutes of straight flying by the flying beast!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan waved his hand as they gradually approached this fortress. The flying units in the sky immediately paused. All the gazes swept toward the figure of the young man who was carrying a heavy ruler in front of them.</p><br/><p>They were at least a thousand meters from the ground and the people below would likely only vaguely see some small black spots if they looked up to such a height from below. However, with Xiao Yan\u2019s eyesight, he could clearly absorb all the activity on the ground into his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze swept over the huge bright red characters on the gate of the fortress. The familiar name caused Xiao Yan\u2019s entire body to appear as though it was filled with electricity. A numb feeling writhed within his blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhen Gui Pass\u2026 it has been three years since they parted. There might be little change to the city but the people have already changed drastically.\u201d Xiao Yan sighed softly as he whispered.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother, it seems that something is wrong\u2026 this \u2018Zhen Gui Pass\u2019 seems to be a little too quiet today. According to what I know, this is the largest fortress within fifty kilometers of this place. There would be some hustle and bustle even at night. Now, however\u2026\u201d Xiao Li suddenly frowned and spoke somewhat doubtfully while Xiao Yan was sighing emotionally in his heart.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was also startled when he heard this. His gaze swept over the silent fortress and surprise also flashed in his eyes, \u201cIndeed\u2026 when I was leaving from this place back then there was extremely great human traffic here. What happened today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that someone already learned about the news of your return?\u201d Lin Xiu Ya also extended his head over and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow can this be possible? The \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 and the Jia Ma Empire are so far apart. No one in the Jia Ma Empire should be aware about any news regarding me.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head and said.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe city seems to have traces of a fight. Moreover, there are quite a number of strong people gathered in a single location.\u201d Medusa, who had been silent, suddenly spoke in a faint voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was startled when he heard Medusa\u2019s words. He immediately shut his eyes slowly and his powerful Spiritual Strength spread out like a torrent from between his eyebrows. Finally, it swiftly swept over the entire fortress below.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li and the others ceased speaking when they saw Xiao Yan shut his eyes. They quietly waited for him to investigate.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan opened his eyes once again some time later. His gaze turned to the middle of the fortress. An unexpected smile surfaced on the corner of his mouth as he softly spoke, \u201cThis fortress is indeed not quite peaceful. Moreover, it is really unexpected that I am able to meet some familiar people just upon my return to the Jia Ma Empire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFamiliar people?\u201d Xiao Li was stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go down and take a look\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan smiled but did not say anything else. He waved his hand and immediately commanded the Tiger Eagle Beasts as they flapped their flesh wings and descended. The ten plus flying beast also followed closely behind.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the atmosphere within a spacious front yard in the middle of the city governor's mansion in the Zhen Gui Pass was extremely anxious with the possibility of a conflict breaking out at any time. Two groups of people were facing each other with hostility. Shining weapons carried a denseness under the sunlight. Clearly, this was not some acting. Instead, they were really going to fight each other with sharp blades.</p><br/><p>\u201cMeng Li, you actually dare to privately attack your commander. You will have difficulty keeping your head if this matter were to reach the capital!\u201d A strong looking middle-aged man from one of the clusters of people, who looked like a metal pagoda, cried out while furiously looking at the man on the other side who had a cold smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, Mu Tie, don\u2019t use this method on me. Although I have made preparations for this for a long time, I would naturally not dare to do such an outrageous thing without the support of someone.\u201d The man wearing a yellow robe laughed in a dark voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cSupport? You mean\u2026 the Misty Cloud Sect?\u201d The man who was addressed as Mu Tie eyes shrank when he heard this. He cried out in a shocked voice, \u201cWhat does the Misty Cloud Sect want to do? If the imperial family knows this, it will definitely maneuver their troops to destroy them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, the imperial family? So what? Would the Misty Cloud Sect be afraid of them with its strength?\u201d Meng Li laughed. His gaze immediately turned cold as he spoke in a sinister manner, \u201cAs long as I kill you, I will naturally have my own method to control this \u2018Zhen Gui Pass\u2019. With the reputation that I have established over these years, it might be a little troublesome to incorporate all the soldiers here under me but it is not impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually want to incorporate the empire\u2019s army under you?\u201d Mu Tie gently inhaled a breath of cool air. A storm rose in his heart. He knew that if the matter here were to spread to the capital, it was likely that the entire Jia Ma Empire would show feel an earth-shaking shock. It was unexpected that the Misty Cloud Sect was already this crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough this city governor\u2019s mansion will be the place you die, it is best that you remain unaware of some things.\u201d Meng Li laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to kill me with your peak Dou Ling\u2019s strength?\u201d Mu Tie furiously laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander Mu Tie, I know that you have broken through to the Dou Wang class recently. However, a person who has yet to even stabilize his strength in the Dou Wang class dares to be this arrogant?\u201d Meng Li curled his lips in disdain. He immediately cried out loud, \u201cElder Yun Fan, please intervene and get rid of this person!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meng Li\u2019s voice had just sounded when a rushing wind sound suddenly appeared. Immediately over ten white-robed human figures flashed and appeared on the surrounding tall walls of the front yard. The person at the front was an old man with a calm water-like face. A pressuring atmosphere covered the entire city governor\u2019s mansion upon his appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYun Fan? An Elder of the Misty Cloud Sect?\u201d Mu Tie\u2019s expression was ugly as he looked at the old man who had appeared. A gloominess involuntarily surged in his heart. He had been lingering around the peak of the Dou Ling class for so many years and had only luckily broke through to the Dou Wang class not long ago. If one was to discuss his strength, he could not even be truly considered a one star Dou Wang. How would he be able to contend with a Misty Cloud Sect\u2019s Elder whose strength had reached that of a three star Dou Wang?</p><br/><p>\u201cCommander Mu Tie, it would be best that you hand the military symbol over. Your Mu clan is also one of the three large clans of the empire. If your clan joins with our Misty Cloud Sect, the things that the Mu Clan will gain in the future will definitely be even more than now. If you continue to be unrepentant, it is likely that destruction will not be far away.\u201d Yun Fan glanced indifferently at the ugly expression of Mu Tie and slowly spoke</p><br/><p>TL: military symbol - in ancient china, this item is used to enable quick maneuver of the military. Whoever holds it has the right to command the military.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Misty Cloud Sect is committing treason and is certainly a disgrace. I, Mu Tie, am a general of the empire. There is no need for others to tell me off if I were to surrender to you. Even I, myself, would look down on me!\u201d Mu Tie angrily retorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cStubborn fool!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yun Fan shook his head. His expression also gradually turned colder. He clenched his fist and a dark-blue longsword appeared in his hand. The sword tip was raised level as it locked onto Mu Tie before he spoke in an indifferent manner, \u201cThe only fate of anyone who hinders our Misty Cloud Sect is death. Since you remain unrepentant, don\u2019t blame the old me for being merciless.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, it\u2019s just as well. I have yet to exchange blows with anyone since I have broken through to the Dou Wang class. Today, I will not lose out even if I end up dying in your hands. However, the wild ambition of the Misty Cloud Sect will definitely die in its embryonic stage!\u201d Mu Tie also raised all the fighting intent in his heart when he heard the killing intent that was contained in Yun Fan\u2019s voice. Although he knew it was definitely impossible for him to defeat the other party, it was better to fight to death than to surrender in this kind of situation.</p><br/><p>Yun Fan narrowed his old eyes. His expression grew increasingly colder. An incomparably powerful Dou Qi slowly surged out from his body and the pressuring strength that was created from the Dou Qi caused quite a number of people in the yard to hurriedly step back.</p><br/><p>Mu Tie\u2019s expression also gradually became solemn in the face of Yun Fan\u2019s powerful Dou Qi aura. He withdrew a huge axe from his storage ring. The Dou Qi in his body was circulated to its limit\u2026</p><br/><p>However, just as the anxious swords drawn atmosphere was about to be broken by an intense battle between strong Dou Wangs was about to erupt, a clear laugh slowly transmitted from the sky. The laughter lingered within the yard and did not disappear for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, it has been three years since I left. I didn\u2019t expect that the Misty Cloud Sect to become this arrogant. It really greatly exceeded my expectations. Looks like old dog Yun Shan has quite the wild ambition\u2026\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Immediately, numerous cries of disbelief were emitted from Xiao Li, First Elder Su Qian, and a couple of others.</p><br/><p>\u201cThird brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan removed the black Doupeng completely from his head and stored it into his Storage Ring. His shrugged his shoulders toward Xiao Li\u2019s group whose faces were filled with disbelief. He smiled and said, \u201cWhy? Don\u2019t you recognise me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Li\u2019s group slowly recovered from their shock after hearing this familiar voice. Joy instantly surged onto their faces. Xiao Li took strode over and violently patted Xiao Yan\u2019s shoulders before laughing with a face filled with smiles, \u201cIt is unexpected that the mysterious tier 6 alchemist is actually you. You really caused us to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>A warmth also surged in Xiao Yan\u2019s heart as he looked at Xiao Li, whose face was filled with joy. He softly laughed, \u201cThe situation in the Black Emperor City is not quite right. Moreover, I\u2019m worried that those fellows from the Demon Flame Valley would recognize me. Hence, I have hidden my shape and face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, these words are true. A drawing of you has already been passed to every high ranking person in the Demon Flame Valley. Should you reveal yourself, they would definitely recognize you.\u201d Xiao Li laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is?\u201d Xiao Li\u2019s gaze suddenly turned to the Little Fairy Doctor by Xiao Yan\u2019s side. The smile on his face was withdrawn as he politely inquired. Given the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s Dou Zong class strength, even Xiao Li did not dare to be too careless with his words.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe is my friend. Second brother can call her the Little Fairy Doctor.\u201d Xiao Yan laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Xiao Li.\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s exquisite face by the side revealed a smile as she softly spoke to Xiao Li.</p><br/><p>\u201cUgh\u2026 you flatter me, you flatter me. Miss is really too polite.\u201d Xiao Li hurriedly waved his hand as he replied. His entire body trembled after being addressed by the Little Fairy Doctor as big brother Xiao Li. When they were at the Black Emperor Pavilion back then, he had personally felt the dense killing intent that had pervaded her body. He naturally knew that despite the ethereal and moving appearance of this lady, she was definitely a vicious person when she attacked. Moreover, this was the first time in his life that he had been addressed so courteously by an elite Dou Zong. Therefore, his heart appeared to be somewhat flustered.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was also similarly stunned by the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s form of address. His gaze was a little surprised as he glanced at her. She actually addressed someone in this manner given her character?</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor acted as though she did not see Xiao Yan\u2019s surprised gaze while a smile hung on her face. She appeared like the kind girl from Qingshan Town back then. She looked completely innocent, causing one to feel extremely attracted to her.</p><br/><p>Xiao Li whispered in his heart as he looked at the two people. He naturally knew that this lady, whose hair was as white as snow, was this courteous to him on the account of Xiao Yan. Hence, his heart let out a bitter laugh. Did this third brother of his have a great affinity with women? Moreover, the women by his side were not ordinary people. Medusa from the last time was also a genuine elite Dou Zong. This time around, this Little Fairy Doctor, who appeared from nowhere, was actually an elite Dou Zong whom even First Elder Su Qian was quite afraid of.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle fellow, you actually know how to return to the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019...\u201d While Xiao Li was sighing in his heart about how Xiao Yan had such a great affinity with women, First Elder Su Qian had also recovered from his earlier shock. He took two steps forward and spoke with some resentment.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan gave an embarrassed smile when he heard this. He hurriedly said, \u201cFirst Elder, please forgive me. Originally, I should have made a trip over earlier, but I undertook a year long retreat in order to breakthrough to the Dou Huang class which ended up delaying this trip.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have broken through to the Dou Huang class?\u201d Xiao Li was immediately stunned when he heard Xiao Yan\u2019s words. He asked with a surprised voice. Although he knew that Xiao Yan was already at the peak of the Dou Wang class when he left back then, it was quite difficult to breakthrough this barrier. Some people had even remained at the peak of the Dou Wang class for their entire life. Yet, Xiao Yan was able to breakthrough the barrier within a short one year. This speed was naturally considered unusually terrifying.</p><br/><p>The eyes of Su Qian by the side were also a little shocked. From Xiao Yan\u2019s ability to refine a tier 6 medicinal pill, he had guessed that Xiao Yan might have already broken through that barrier. However, his heart still felt extremely surprised after hearing the person in question say it out loud. This kind of training speed could be considered at the peak that Su Qian had seen after so many years.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was merely lucky.\u201d Xiao Yan slightly smiled. The people present were those whom he could trust. Hence, he would naturally not purposefully hide something.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, little fellow, you have done well. Father\u2019s eyesight is really different. From the very beginning, he knew that you were not an ordinary person.\u201d Xiao Li laughed out loud. His excitement was even greater than if he had broken past the Dou Wang class.</p><br/><p>Some sadness flashed through Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes without leaving a trace when he heard Xiao Li mention their father. It immediately disappeared as Xiao Yan smiled and said, \u201cThe main reason I have revealed myself is to request second brother\u2019s and First Elder Su Qian\u2019s help.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, we are one family, why are you saying help? You are \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019s\u2019 chief and have the authority to maneuver everyone in the faction.\u201d Xiao Li curled his mouth when he heard this. He immediately turned to the ten plus experts from \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 and cried out, \u201cThis is my third brother, the chief whom all of you have heard about. Why aren\u2019t you greeting him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ten plus experts from \u2018Xiao Gate,\u2019 who possessed extraordinary strength, immediately knelt with one knee on the ground after hearing Xiao Li\u2019s cry. They respectfully said, \u201cThese subordinates greet chief!\u201d</p><br/><p>These experts from \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 did not hesitate even a little when they knelt. They naturally felt a great joy with the status that Xiao Yan had revealed. They might not be certain of Xiao Yan\u2019s strength. However, just being a tier 6 alchemist was enough to cause their hearts to be filled with excitement.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled as he looked at the experts from \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 who had knelt down. He immediately waved his sleeves gently. The energy fluctuated and a gentle breeze lifted everyone up. He smiled and said, \u201cEveryone here is brothers of \u2018Xiao Gate.\u2019 There is no need to be so polite. We can forget about all these unnecessary rituals.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hearts of these experts from \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 shivered when they felt Xiao Yan easily lift them up by simply raising his hand. They no longer held the slightest doubt about Xiao Yan\u2019s strength in their hearts. These members of the Xiao Gate would display a greater confidence when walking outside with such a powerful chief.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan walked into the hall after lifting everyone up. After which, he unceremoniously sat in a chair beside the table. The Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan also followed him and sat down. The latter pulled down her black robe. Silk like purple-colored hair rolled down as she parted her mouth and smiled at the stunned face of First Elder Su Qian.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou girl\u2026 you actually also followed him back.\u201d First Elder Su Qian spoke helplessly after seeing that the last black-robed person was actually Zi Yan. He felt neither able to laugh nor cry.</p><br/><p>\u201cZi Yan also possesses the strength of a Dou Huang. Other than some elite Dou Zong, she can walk this \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 without any fear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su Qian was startled when he heard this. His gaze immediately swept over Zi Yan with surprise as he said, \u201cThis girl has actually broken through to the Dou Huang class.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Yan immediately waved her small fist, feeling pleased when she saw the surprise on Su Qian\u2019s face. She said, \u201cOld fellow, I said that trapping me in the Inner Academy back then is definitely a form of harm to me. If you had let me out earlier, I might already be an elite Dou Zong now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t dispute the old me. If I had not gotten you to follow beside Xiao Yan, I would not know if you had been sold by someone. What Dou Zong\u2026\u201d Su Qian shook his head as he replied, feeling neither able to laugh nor cry.</p><br/><p>Zi Yan\u2019s fine eyebrows became vertical when she heard Su Qian\u2019s words. She was about to go wild when Xiao Yan\u2019s palm was placed on her small head, pressing her into her seat. \u201cBe quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zi Yan unhappily shook her head after Xiao Yan pressed down on her. She felt bitterly dispirited as she lay on the table. Her eyes were viciously staring at the smiling Su Qian.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt looks like only you are able to control this mischievous girl. I have experienced a much quieter time after she left the Inner Academy. The Inner Academy also no longer needs to worry about when it will lose a large amount of medicinal ingredients.\u201d Su Qian softly laughed after seeing Zi Yan being restrained by Xiao Yan. He immediately seemed to have recalled something as he stared at Xiao Yan and said, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Since you have come to the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019, you should quickly return and supplement the Heart Flame of the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019. That \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 has already lost its effect for half a year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan awkwardly nodded when he heard this. He hurriedly said, \u201cFirst Elder, please rest assured that I will return to the Inner Academy to replenish the Heart Flame after this matter is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Su Qian let out a snort and took out a bright-red scroll from his storage ring. He threw it to Xiao Yan and said, \u201cTake it. This is the ruler technique Dou Skill that your second brother had bought for you in the auction. He was actually willing to offend an elite Dou Zong for this thing.\u201d His gaze drifted to the Little Fairy Doctor by Xiao Yan\u2019s side when he spoke until this point. He also muttered in his heart, questioning why the woman companions by Xiao Yan\u2019s side always possessed such a frightening strength.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan received the bright-red scroll and felt the faint warmth of it. A warm feeling flowed into his heart. At that time, Xiao Li was not aware of their identities. Despite this, he dared to auction for this ruler technique Dou Skill. Xiao Li intended to increase the Xiao Yan\u2019s strength by a little. This affection was that of blood-related brothers.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be moved for nothing. You are the most precious person in our Xiao clan. Big brother said that everyone can die but you. Hence, you should live well and quickly become strong. This is because you are the only one with the ability to rescue father from the damn \u2018Hall of Souls\u2019.\u201d Xiao Li curled his mouth when he saw Xiao Yan staring at the scroll. He smiled and continued, \u201cLet\u2019s quickly proceed to talk about the important matter. What is the reason for you to come and look for us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan also smiled when he heard this. He gently nodded and stored the scroll into his Storage Ring. After musing for a moment, his face gradually turned solemn as his gaze swept over Xiao Li and Su Qian. He said in a soft, deep voice, \u201cI wish to obtain the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

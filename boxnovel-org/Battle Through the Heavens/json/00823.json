The glaring sunlight shone down from the sky. The sound of bustling noise was a demon tune as it poured into his ears, causing Xiao Yan to frown.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan narrowed his eyes as he slowly lifted his head. He looked at the enormous inner part of the city and the crowded human traffic that moved along the spacious roads in front of him. He could not help but let out a prasing sigh. The size of this Black Emperor City was not smaller than the capital of the Jia Ma Empire. From a certain point of view, even the Jia Ma Empire\u2019s capital could not compare with it. After all, the things that this place had were things that the capital did not.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere should we go next?\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s eyes shifted around as she softly asked.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan mused slightly before he immediately said, \u201cWe will first go to the larger medicinal shops in the city and take a look around. The interior of the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 possesses quite a number of rare medicinal ingredients the outside world lacks. If we are lucky enough, we might be able to obtain some of the medicinal ingredients that we need. Moreover, we have to inquire about information related to the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva. That thing\u2026 even I don\u2019t have sufficient knowledge of that thing. Therefore, we can only go and inquire.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor nodded slightly and did not voice an objection.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, you can just attack the next time we meet that kind of person. This kind of situation is extremely common in the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. No one will fault you\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan slowly walked toward a spacious street as randomly explained.</p><br/><p>The Little Fairy Doctor was slightly startled. A moving smile immediately surfaced on the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s face. She nodded her head, pulled Zi Yan\u2019s hand and immediately followed him.</p><br/><p>The three of them slowly walked through the interior of this enormous Black Emperor City. After this personal appearance, they finally clearly understood just how many people had come to the Black Emperor City for this large-scale auction\u2026</p><br/><p>Curses and screams were repeatedly transmitted into their ears from the street. Numerous large shops stood orderly by the two sides of the street. Without exception, these shops were all filled with the people coming and going. This great auction had brought the Black Emperor City an enormous amount of human traffic and profits.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s three man group slowly walked down the street. Their gaze repeatedly swept over those shops on both sides of the street. They had seen quite a number of medicinal shops along the way and had entered them to look and inquire. However, the sizes of these medicinal shops were not very big. Therefore, they did not find any of the medicinal ingredients that Xiao Yan needed.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yan did not gain anything, he did not become anxious. The medicinal ingredients he needed were all very rare items. Even though this \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 had a rich collection, it was naturally impossible for him to gather all of them within a short while.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s group passed by two streets along the way before their footsteps finally came to a stop in front of an extremely large penthouse-like medicinal shop.</p><br/><p>The medicinal shop was called \u2018Thousand Medicinal House\u2019. Its size was extremely big and could be considered the largest shop that Xiao Yan\u2019s group had seen ever since they had entered the city. Moreover, this shop appeared to have quite a great reputation within the Black Emperor City. Hence, the human traffic coming to and from the big entrance seemed to be squeezed together. Noisy curses were repeatedly transmitted over.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan stood outside of the \u2018Thousand Medicinal House\u2019. He hesitated for a moment before leading the Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan to squeeze into the human flow. The powerful Dou Qi within his body emitted a force that seemed to quietly push aside those people blocking his way gently as though he was splitting the flow of a river. After which, the three of them swaggered into this \u2018Thousand Medicinal Shop\u2019.</p><br/><p>The noisy curses were greatly reduced after they entered the \u2018Thousand Medicinal House\u2019. A rich medicinal fragrance that was mixed from a countless number of medicinal ingredients pounced over. The richness of the medicinal fragrance nearly caused Xiao Yan to violently sneeze.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan rubbed his nose as he allowed his gaze to roam. He could see that this incomparably large hall was filled with many transparent counters. Various medicinal ingredients were neatly placed within those counters. Moreover, quite a number of people were currently gathered around these counters.</p><br/><p>The large hall was divided into a medicinal ingredient section and a medicinal pill section. If one were to compare them, the medicinal pill section would undoubtedly possess more people. After all, the people of the \u2018Black-Corner Region,\u2019 who spent all day licking blood from their blades, would rather own a medicinal pill that could save their lives or unleash great strength in a dangerous situation. This desire was undoubtedly much more precious compared to swallowing just medicinal ingredients.</p><br/><p>However, an alchemist like Xiao Yan placed a greater value on medicinal ingredients. After all, as long as the medicinal ingredients were in his hand, he would naturally be able to refine the medicinal ingredients\u2026</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan pulled Zi Yan along while she was deeply inhaling through her little nose. The three of them slowly walked toward a crystal counter. His gaze immediately swept over it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreen Wind Grass\u2026 Wind Fire Scale Fruit\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze swept over the medicinal ingredients displayed on the counter and identified them immediately. He immediately shook his head. The things here might not be ordinary things but it was far from the tier of the medicinal ingredients he needed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is indeed a reason why \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019 is able to attract quite a number of people from the outside over. If it was outside, just these medicinal ingredients alone would definitely be treated as a great treasure of the shop. How could they be randomly displayed and sold in a similar place\u2026\u201d The Little Fairy Doctor softly sighed. Being a poison master, she was naturally quite familiar with these medicinal ingredients.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan smiled and nodded. He was about to speak when a laugh was transmitted from the other side of the counter, \u201cGuests, may I know what kind of medicinal ingredients you need? Our Thousand Medicinal House is a large medicinal shop that is ranked among the top within the \u2018Black-Corner Region\u2019. I think that this place should possess the things that you want to buy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan raised his head and glanced at an old man who had appeared behind the counter. From the looks of the other party\u2019s clothes, it was obvious that he should be someone from the medicinal shop. Xiao Yan did not say any nonsense. He took out a white sheet of paper from his Storage Ring. The couple of important medicinal ingredients to refine the \u2018Heaven Soul Blood Bone Pill\u2019 were written on it.</p><br/><p>The old man received the white paper with both hands. Initially, his gaze randomly swept over it but he immediately became startled. His eyes once again weighed Xiao Yan. A glint appeared in his eyes as he inquired, \u201cIs mister an alchemist?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy? Don\u2019t tell me that an alchemist cannot come and buy the medicinal ingredients in this medicinal shop?\u201d Xiao Yan replied with a faint voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, mister, please do not take offence. The old me is a tier 2 alchemist. It is just that I feel familiar with the way these medicinal ingredients are arranged.\u201d The old man laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan only came to a sudden understanding after hearing this. The medicinal effects and attributes of the medicinal ingredients were all different. An outsider would have difficulty differentiating them. However, with Xiao Yan\u2019s current alchemist skill, he naturally placed the medicinal ingredients with similar medicinal effects together like second nature when he wrote this list of ingredients. It was unexpected that this old man had actually meticulously discovered it\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cI can be considered to be one\u2026 do you have these medicinal ingredients?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, there are a total of eight medicinal ingredients on this. Our \u2018Thousand Medicinal House\u2019 does indeed have the first five. However, they are a little expensive. It is likely that they will require a total of two million gold coins or so\u2026 however, the last three, Thousand Spiritual Ginseng, Demon Spiritual Valley Grass, and Jade Bone Fruit\u2026 are far too difficult to find.\u201d The old man laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan slightly sighed in relief when he heard him, but he was also a little disappointed. The first five medicinal ingredients might be rare, but they were really not too difficult to find. The hardest were the last three. It was unexpected that even this place did not have them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, help me bring the first five medicinal ingredients over. I will think of other methods to look for the last three.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head. He counted the gold coins stored within the crystal card in his Storage Ring. After using most of the money that had been obtained from the medicinal pill auction that \u2018Xiao Gate\u2019 had held back then, Xiao Yan had around four million gold coins. Currently, it was enough to purchase the medicinal ingredients.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, mister, do you really need these three medicinal ingredients?\u201d The old man nodded with a smile as he ordered a female servant to get the medicinal ingredients. After which, he turned to Xiao Yan and asked a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have a solution?\u201d Xiao Yan raised his brows when he heard this. His voice was somewhat surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, I only said that these three medicinal ingredients are very rare, but I did not say that our Thousand Medicinal House does not have them. However, a rare medicinal ingredient of such a tier will usually not be taken out to be sold\u2026\u201d The old man laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you have already opened your mouth, I don\u2019t think it is merely to tell me this, no?\u201d Xiao Yan gently rubbed his Storage Ring as he replied in a calm voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cMister is really a forthright person. I shall tell you this directly. If you want to obtain these three medicinal ingredients, you must go to the second story of this Thousand Medicinal House. The value of the medicinal ingredients there is more expensive than the ones on the first floor. However, you cannot use gold coins to purchase the medicinal ingredients at that place. Instead, you must refine a medicinal pill that is of similar value to these medicinal ingredients as per the requirement. Only then can you take the ingredient away\u2026\u201d The old man softly laughed, \u201cIn other words, only an alchemist has the qualification to enter.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh?\u201d Xiao Yan felt somewhat surprised upon hearing such a strange rule. However, he immediately came to a sudden understanding. When an items value hit a certain degree, it was difficult to use gold coins to measure its worth. At such a time, one must take out something that was of similar worth in order to exchange for it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you say? May I know if mister is interested in heading up to the second story to take a look? The rarity of the medicinal ingredients on the second storey is far from what here can compare with. I think that the three medicinal ingredients that you need can be found above.\u201d The old man laughed.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan mused for a moment before nodding. The last three medicinal ingredients were very rare. If he were to go and search for them, he would not know just when he would be able to find them. It would naturally be best if he was able to obtain them here. Moreover, from what this old man had said, the second storey had even more rare items. He might even be able to obtain some information that was related to the Bodhisattva Body Transformation Saliva from there\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cIn that case, please lead the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKe ke, this old man shall give mister a reminder here. Given the value of the medicinal ingredients that you need, it is likely that you will be required to use a tier 4 or even tier 5 medicinal pill to exchange for them. If you are unable to refine a medicinal pill of this tier, then\u2026\u201d The smile on that old man\u2019s face initially became even more vivid when he saw Xiao Yan nodding his head in agreement. However, he hesitated for a moment before voicing his reminder.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s eyelids did not even move when he heard this. He faintly said, \u201cLead the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>An unusual glint flashed across the eyes of the old man when he saw Xiao Yan\u2019s manner. A respectful expression immediately surged onto his face before he lead the way in front while bending his body humbly.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s take a look at the second story to see if there is anything you require\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan turned his head and smiled to the Little Fairy Doctor and Zi Yan. After which, he lifted his feet and followed the old man. Xiao Yan actually possessed a lot of curiosity toward the unusual and rare medicinal ingredients that the old man had mentioned. After all, medicinal ingredients possessed a greater attraction to alchemists than medicinal pills did.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

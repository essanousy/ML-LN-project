Chaotic spatial flow surged, hiding a fatal danger\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cSwoosh!\u201d</p><br/><p>The deafening sound of rushing wind was suddenly transmitted amid the silence. A large cluster of light surfaced from the darkness in the distance. After which, it arrived with a swift speed. The wild and violent wind it stirred caused even the chaotic spatial flow to be torn apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sister, the three great dragon islands have attacked the Eastern Dragon Island. If they gain our help, they should be able to defeat the Eastern Dragon Island\u2026\u201d A black-robed elder beside the leading red-robed woman slowly opened his mouth. His voice was extremely hoarse as a kind of suction force suddenly spread from his mouth. This person was called Kun Huang. Many of his opponents had been devoured by him after being captured. His ferocious reputation was extremely well-known. Many experts would tremble in fear upon hearing his name.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is no need to be in such a hurry. We\u2019ll let them fight with each other a little longer. The more deaths the better.\u201d The eyes of the red-robed woman flickered as she indifferently spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, the three great dragon islands requesting our help is something really unexpected\u2026\u201d The other elder with a somewhat shady face also laughed in a strange manner. He was Ying Huang of the Heaven Demon Three Phoenix.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce we have finished off the Eastern Dragon Island and obtained the Dragon Phoenix Bloodline, it will only be a matter of time before the three great dragon islands are eliminated by us\u2026\u201d The red-robed woman faintly laughed. She waved her sleeve and was just about to speed up when a sense of danger suddenly rumbled within her heart. Before she could react, wave after wave of extremely powerful Dou Qi pillars suddenly erupted from the chaotic spatial flow. These pillars were extremely sharp. They shot into the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe\u2019s group in an instant, causing miserable screeches to erupt.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you cowardly beings? You actually dare to ambush our Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe? You are seeking death!\u201d</p><br/><p>The red-robed woman suddenly recovered at this moment. She immediately became furious after seeing the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe suffer severe losses in an instant. Her hand suddenly grabbed at the chaotic spatial flow below. The space at that spot became distorted. A \u2018bang\u2019 sounded as the extremely chaotic spatial flow exploded because of her.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, if we are cowards, why would we intercept your Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe?\u201d</p><br/><p>A loud laugh suddenly resounded as the chaotic spatial flow suddenly parted. Immediately, a figure rushed out of it. Finally, it appeared in front of the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe. Both of his hands were waved as a monstrous aura spread. \u201cHeaven Demon Three Phoenix. It has been hundreds of years since we have last met. How are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Feng Huang\u2019s eyes contained ill-intent as they stared at Yao Ming, who had appeared in front of her. She frowned and her eyes immediately turned dark and solemn. \u201cYao Ming\u2026 you are still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is actually that old demon? Didn\u2019t he lose control while training and died?\u201d Kun Huang and Ying Huang were startled upon hearing Feng Huang\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHee hee, even you three old demons have yet to die. Why would I die so easily?\u201d Yao Ming laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cRegardless of the reason for being alive, you are really becoming bolder. Looks like the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe has been too comfortable during these years. Could it be that you really think that you can step over my tribe just because we are ranked at the same level?\u201d Feng Huang stared at Yao Ming with a dark and cold expression. Her tone was extremely sinister.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe is really acting in a grand fashion.\u201d</p><br/><p>A faint laugh was suddenly emitted from behind Yao Ming. The space beside him slightly fluctuated as a figure slowly appeared in front of everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Feng Huang\u2019s expression was slightly different after seeing the human figure appear beside Yao Ming. She could sense that this human figure was actually an advanced one star Dou Sheng.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Qing Er and Jiu Feng behind involuntarily cried out with shocked faces after Feng Huang\u2019s words escaped her mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yan? You are that main culprit that prevented our Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe from obtaining the Dragon Phoenix Origin Fruit, Xiao Yan?\u201d Feng Huang\u2019s expression became completely gloomy after hearing these exclamations. She looked at Xiao Yan, grit her teeth, and asked a question.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like I am quite well-known within the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled. He randomly glanced at Jiu Feng and Feng Qing Er. Those two trembled slightly as he did so. It had been two years since they had last met. The strength of Feng Qing Er had remained stagnant. It was likely that this was the sequelae from the soar in her strength after changing bones. Jiu Feng, on the other hand, had reached the ninth change peak of the Dou Zun class. There was only a step between him and the Ban Sheng class. Clearly, this future tribal chief of the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe possessed a great talent.</p><br/><p>\u201cHu\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Huang inhaled a deep breath of air before slowly exhaling. Her eyes were dark and solemn as they stared at Xiao Yan and Yao Ming\u2019s group. From the looks of the situation, it was obvious that they had come with ill-intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYao Ming, are you seeking to start an all out war between the Nine Serene Deep Ground Python tribe and the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe?\u201d Feng Huang cried out in an icy-cold voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have no choice. I have also been invited to help, but instead of helping the three great dragon islands, I am helping the Eastern Dragon Island.\u201d Yao Ming spread his hands and laughed. He was not an ordinary person. It was impossible for him to be frightened by Feng Huang. Her ferocious reputation did not pose much of a threat to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou three, we will not attack if you choose to lead your people and turn around now.\u201d Xiao Yan smiled as he gave them a choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho do you think you are? You dare to demand that we turn around? Moreover, even if we really return, do you really think that nothing will happen to the Eastern Dragon Island? The three great dragon islands have likely already surrounded the Eastern Dragon Island. By the time you hurry over, you might only end up finding a wasteland!\u201d That shady-faced Feng Huang spoke in a dark and cold voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan suddenly clenched his fist under his sleeve after hearing this claim. It was unexpected that the three large dragon islands were so anxious. They were already attacking\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYou should get out of this empty realm now. Otherwise, none of you will be able to leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan frowned. He ceased saying any unnecessary words to the Heaven Demon Phoenix tribe. He lifted his head and threatened them in a calm voice.</p><br/><p>Feng Qing Er\u2019s and Jiu Feng\u2019s twitched upon hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s words. This fellow had become arrogant in the two years that they had not met. It should be known that there was a total of three grand Elders on this trip. All of them possessed a genuine Dou Sheng strength. They were peak existences of this world\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cYoung fellow, your mother was not even born while this elderly-self was dominating the Dou Qi continent!\u201d A ferocious glint flashed across Ying Huang\u2019s eyes after hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s unceremonious words. A monstrous Dou Qi instantly erupted from his body like a storm.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Huang\u2019s face was ice-cold. A voice that was filled with murderous desire was spat from her mouth. Although she could sense that Yao Ming\u2019s strength had somewhat surpassed her, there were still three elite Dou Shengs on their side. On the other hand, the other party merely had two Dou Shengs. They held the advantage in this lineup. How could they simply withdraw just because someone told them to?</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, alright, this king shall test whether your Sky Demon Three Phoenix has improved during these many years!\u201d Yao Ming lifted his head and loudly laughed. His body moved as he rushed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI will fight you myself. Zu Yi, Kun Huang, the both of you should deal with that brat. Ying Huang, lead the others to kill off the remaining people!\u201d Feng Huang coldly laughed. Her body rushed forward and violently collided with Yao Ming without giving in. Immediately, wave after wave of an energy storm that caused one\u2019s heart to tremble began to sweep apart.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust one of you will not be able to block me. Two of you should fight together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan laughed out loud. His body moved and he appeared in front of Kun Huang. A golden light surged and his body suddenly swelled. A fist that contained an extermination wind was mercilessly thrown.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevouring the world!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kun Huang\u2019s expression changed when he sensed Xiao Yan\u2019s powerful attack. He widened his mouth and black vapor surged out. In an instant, it turned into a thousand-foot-large ferocious mouth that attempted to swallow Xiao Yan\u2019s fist.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour appetite is really big. Be careful of being bloated!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan coldly laughed after seeing this mouth form. His arm violently shook as the huge black vapor mouth was forcefully shattered. The remaining force poured into Kun Huang\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cGroan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kun Huang let out a soft groan after being struck by Xiao Yan\u2019s fist. He staggered back over a hundred meters before coming to a halt. His face was a little shocked as he looked at Xiao Yan. They were both advanced one star Dou Shengs, but Xiao Yan\u2019s fighting strength was exceptionally powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ying Huang, who was planning on dealing with the Little Fairy Doctor\u2019s group, was greatly startled after seeing Kun Huang be sent flying back by Xiao Yan\u2019s punch. He hesitated for a moment before moving. Finally, he appeared beside Kun Huang. His eyes were cautious and dark as they looked at Xiao Yan. He spoke in a deep voice, \u201cThere is something strange about this fellow. We should join hands and quickly finish him off!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kun Huang hesitated a little after hearing this suggestion. In the end, he clenched his teeth and nodded. After the exchange earlier, he understood that his strength could not match Xiao Yan alone. This had caused him to feel a little stifled.</p><br/><p>Feng Qing Er and Jiu Feng had somewhat pale expressions as they watched this scene from afar. Their eyes were filled with disbelief as they stared at the golden figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cDou Sheng\u2026 moreover, he is a Dou Sheng who is stronger than Elder Kun Huang\u2026 how is this possible? How was it possible that this fellow has been able to improve so much within two years?\u201d</p><br/><p>While they were trying their best to surpass Xiao Yan, they had suddenly realised that they were no longer even able to see his back. This was a big blow to the two of them, who were quite proud.</p><br/><p>\u201cAo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two earth-shaking phoenix cries suddenly reverberated around the empty realm. Kun Huang\u2019s and Ying Huang\u2019s bodies instantly swelled. They turned into a half-human half-beast form in the blink of an eye. Waves of extremely wild and violent fluctuations shot out of their bodies like mini-storms. They forcefully scattered the chaotic flow within a hundred-thousand-foot-radius.</p><br/><p>\u201cHa ha, so what if there are two Dou Shengs? Today, I shall see just what two Dou Shengs can do to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan lifted his head and loudly laughed toward the sky. His laughter was just like thunder. The golden giant stepped through the empty air with an overbearing demeanor!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

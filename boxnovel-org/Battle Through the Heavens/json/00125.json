His hands heavily kneaded the two soft breasts while exerting a slight force. The woman below him briefly arched up her waist like a female cat, letting loose a moaning sound of debauchery.</p><br/><p>Stimulated by this soft moan, He Meng used both arms to tightly hug the woman\u2019s waist. A brief moment later, both naked bodies stiffened.</p><br/><p>Raising his head, the intense pleasure caused He Meng to take a deep breath. His previously stiffened body also quietly softened at this moment.</p><br/><p>As He Meng\u2019s body was slightly shaking due to the pleasure, his sharp senses honed by long years of living at the knife's edge caused his whole body to tighten up again. A bolt of alarm shot across his heart; he grabbed the blanket beside him and threw it behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi la\u201d</p><br/><p>A touch of bitter light easily sliced apart the bedding and a shadow rapidly shot into the tent. A bitter cold blade heartlessly shot towards He Meng\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>This sudden assault caused He Meng\u2019s face to change drastically. His body awkwardly rolled on the bed and dangerously avoided the edge of the blade.</p><br/><p>Failing to hit its target, the blade of the sword slashed out horizontally without hesitation. A glint of cold light swept past the clump of fire within the tent and immediately continued to pursue to evading He Meng and drew a shallow line of blood from his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!\u201d Looking at the black shadow that suddenly barged in, the woman on the bed screamed loudly in horror. With a flip of Xiao Yan\u2019s palm, a piece of charcoal was sucked into his hand. Without even looking back, Xiao Yan threw it behind him. Following this, a short sharp sound that made people feel despair, rang out and the irritating screaming stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you? Why do you want to assassinate me? Don\u2019t you know that I\u2019m one of the three leaders of the Wolf Head Mercenary Company?\u201d Panicking, He Meng raged.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s precisely the reason I am here to kill you.\u201d The black shadow raised his head, revealing the clear features of his youth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 Xiao Yan?!\u201d Looking at the young face, He Meng was stunned. His view quickly shifted away from the the youth to the massive ruler behind his back; narrowing his eyes, he coldly spoke out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an honor, to be able to be remembered by the Third Company Leader.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lightly smiling, Xiao Yan\u2019s palm slightly cupped before suddenly hitting the hilt of the long sword. It became a glint of cold steel, shooting forward like a lightning bolt towards He Meng.</p><br/><p>The speed of the sword was quite fast and even though He Meng\u2019s reactions weren't slow, a wound was still left on his face.</p><br/><p>Licking the blood that flowed from his face, a strong killing intent rose in He Meng\u2019s eyes. Coldly laughing, \u201cYou sure are truly courageous, to the point of daring to assassinate me alone. But this is fine as well since I will do away with you right here. You are simply saving me the trouble of searching for you in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>While speaking, He Meng lightly twisted his head and a light Dou Qi started to appear around his body. A clacking sound was emitted from between the bones of a pair of tightly clenched fists.</p><br/><p>Looking at He Meng who entered his battle state, Xiao Yan helplessly shrugged. This guy\u2019s adaptability to danger far outstripped his expectations, causing his ambush plan to fail.</p><br/><p>However, the ambush came into being because of the fact that the lazy Xiao Yan wanted to save some energy. As this notion was completely dispelled, Xiao Yan didn\u2019t care about spending a little more effort. After all, after his hard months of training, Xiao Yan definitely needed to experience some battles to measure his improvement.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan body slightly twisted, causing his bones to create sounds that were not softer than He Meng\u2019s. Opening his palms slowly and then tightly closing them, a faded yellow Dou Qi began to appear from within his fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, deciding to treat me as your prey will be the stupidest decision of your life!\u201d He Meng\u2019s lips rose with a bloody smile and his feet fiercely stepped on the ground to rush towards Xiao Yan like a massive monster.</p><br/><p>Coldly looking at the beastly He Meng approaching, Xiao Yan\u2019s palms slowly stretched outwards. A moment after, they opened and he shouted, \u201cGet lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Following Xiao Yan\u2019s shout, a fierce and wild strength emerged from his palms and knocked heavily onto He Meng\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a muffled sound and the bloodthirsty look on He Meng\u2019s face grew stale. The stature that was rushing forward flew back fiercely and his feet that were tightly clutching the ground caused a deep trench in the ground for a few meters before he slowly stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure have some skills brat.\u201d A heavy look of consideration appeared on He Meng\u2019s face. He slowly spat out a breath while his fist beat his chest. Slowly his skin that was originally old bronze in color, gradually became whiter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Qi Method that I trained in is in the Rock Attribute which is known for its powerful defense. There is simply no way you can break through my defense by relying on your own power!\u201d While coldly laughing, He Meng\u2019s fists tightened. On his arms, a ghastly white color was beginning to appear.</p><br/><p>He Meng\u2019s feet once again stepping on the ground but his current speed was drastically faster than his previous speed. The wind pressure brought about by this new fierce speed caused the tent to shake.</p><br/><p>Calmly facing the incoming fierce wind, Xiao Yan\u2019s body simply moved slightly sideways as a fist with an enormous force floated by his face.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s feet lightly slid across the ground as he appeared behind He Meng like a ghost. In return, his fist that held Dou Qi heavily smashed into He Meng\u2019s neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cDang!\u201d The fist smashed on He Meng\u2019s body, yet the only result was a clear sound similar to hitting a rock.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s brows slightly wrinkled before he quickly withdrew his fists and lending upon his speed, used his elbows and knees to attack a moment later. Each hit would land on the same spot and briefly inside the tent, there was the continuous sound of beating rocks.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet lost, what an annoying fly. I said earlier that based on your current strength, you are still unable to break my Rock Qi defence!\u201d He Meng delightedly laughed. His right foot bore a fierce and intense strength while he kicked backwards.</p><br/><p>Meeting He Meng\u2019s foot with two palms, the tyrannical power behind the kick caused Xiao Yan\u2019s body to fly backwards.</p><br/><p>\u201cBefitting the reputation of one of the most physical type Dou Qi, this strength...is really strong.\u201d Xiao Yan was amazed. Flipping through the air, Xiao Yan steadily landed back on the ground and shook his slightly numb palms.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrat, with this little strength, you are deluded to oppose the Wolf Head Mercenary Company. You are simply looking for death!\u201d He Meng patted the dust from his back and smiled sinisterly: \u201cI don\u2019t have time to play with you. I\u2019ll just have to finish you off quickly so that you don\u2019t interrupt my pleasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Meng spread his palm in front of his chest and bent his legs. The hair on his head stood up as an off-white Dou Qi flashed across his eyes.</p><br/><p>A white colored gas was spat out from Mu She\u2019s mouth. At that moment, Xiao Yan noticed that He Meng\u2019s limbs had suddenly become much stiff than before.</p><br/><p>The pale muscles on his naked arms continued to vibrate as a ferocious strength began to quickly form with them.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s over, brat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feeling the gushing strength from within his body, He Meng grinned at Xiao Yan. Those white teeth of his carried a whiff of fierceness.</p><br/><p>Staring at He Meng whose strength had suddenly rose significantly, Xiao Yan\u2019s face became serious as Dou Qi began gathering around his hand.</p><br/><p>After circulating the energy in his body, He Meng entered his peak state. His feet stepped off the ground and his speed exploded to the point that it was comparable to Xiao Yan\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s sight became momentarily blurry before He Meng\u2019s sinister face suddenly appeared. His enormous fist carried the sound of incredible wind pressure as it viciously smashed towards Xiao Yan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>The intense force above his head cause Xiao Yan\u2019s expression to change. An explosive force blasted from Xiao Yan\u2019s palm. With the aid of the repulsion created by the blast, Xiao Yan quickly retreated.</p><br/><p>\u201cTrying to escape?\u201d Seeing the hastily retreating Xiao Yan, He Meng coldly laughed. He strided forward and caught up with Xiao Yan. He bent his body and like a creeping leopard, pounced in towards Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo and die!\u201d Grinning wickedly, He Meng\u2019s fist once again furiously smashed downwards on Xiao Yan\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>Looking at this unavoidable situation, Xiao Yan\u2019s brow wrinkled tightly. The Dou Qi inside his body started rapidly flowing, then he raised both fists and intercepted the deathly blow.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d</p><br/><p>A deep but muffled sound exploded within the tent. The strong gust of wind created by the clashing of the two enormous forces shaved off a layer of dirt off the ground where the two men came into contact.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare to directly confront my attack? Get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Xiao Yan chose to take his attack on directly, a cruelness flashed across He Meng\u2019s eyes. All of the Dou Qi in him flowed within his veins and exploded forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cArr\u2026\u201d The enormous force caused Xiao Yan\u2019s face to turn white as a weak groan escaped his throat. His footsteps quickly staggered backwards, stopping only when he reached the edge of the tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI did not expect that you would be able to withstand a direct assault from me. You frequently train your body, don\u2019t you?\u201d Seeing that Xiao Yan appeared to have only received a slight injury, He Meng could not help but say with shock. It should be noted that the hardship one must endure to train the body was something that simply training Dou Qi cannot be compared with. Eyeing Xiao Yan\u2019s tender body, it was difficult for He Meng to imagine that the former was someone who trained his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cLooks like without removing the restrictions, defeating an eight star Dou Zhe is still a little difficult\u2026.\u201d Rubbing his chest that was a little choked, Xiao Yan suddenly mumbled softly and sighed.</p><br/><p>Hearing Xiao Yan\u2019s mumbling, He Meng brow wrinkled and he started coldly sneering.</p><br/><p>Sighing while shaking his head, Xiao Yan, infront of He Meng, slowly removed the heavy ruler from his back and threw it to a side.</p><br/><p>\u201cBang!\u201d There was coincidentally a piece of hard rock where the heavy ruler landed and without any surprise, this rock was ground to dust under the horrifying weight of the heavy ruler.</p><br/><p>Coldly staring at the pile of white powder, He Meng\u2019s pupils shrank to the size of a pinhole and a sliver of fear slowly rose from within his heart and mind. This little brat, he was fighting while carrying such a heavy weapon.</p><br/><p>Deeply breathing in the cold air, He Meng looked at the youth again and there was an extra weight of consideration and shock in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Ignoring the changes in the other party\u2019s eyes, Xiao Yan comfortably stretched his body, the Dou Qi surging in his body made him feel as if he was full of energy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI apologize. I was just warming up.\u201d Raising his face, Xiao Yan had a hint of apology on his face before his body suddenly flashed forwards.</p><br/><p>The image in front of him flashed past and while He Meng was still unable to react, the youth\u2019s soft voice slowly reached his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the end, Wolf Head Mercenary Company\u2019s third captain\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

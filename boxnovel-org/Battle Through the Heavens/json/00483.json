He slowly walked toward this somewhat special stone table. Upon seeing his action, the surrounding human flow involuntarily halted their footsteps. The gazes which they used to look at Xiao Yan appeared to contract a playfulness of watching the fun.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s footsteps stopped in front of the stone platform. His eyes shot to that Green Wood Celestial Vine. After hesitating for a moment, his hand extended toward it.</p><br/><p>\u201cChi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Xiao Yan\u2019s hand was about to touch that Green Wood Celestial Vine, a sharp wind suddenly rushed through the air toward him. The strength of the wind even caused the hair on Xiao Yan\u2019s hand to stand up in shock.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan knit his eyebrows as he sensed the sharpness of the force. A thought passed through his heart and green-colored flame immediately surged out from within the Acceptance Spirit. After which, it swiftly moved passed a few Qi Paths before it suddenly broke free from his body and swiftly wrapped around his withdrawing hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant Xiao Yan\u2019s hand was wrapped by the green-colored flame, a surprised exclamation suddenly sounded. That sharp wind was immediately annihilated.</p><br/><p>After successfully withdrawing his hand, Xiao Yan lifted his head to eye the gray-robed man in front of him. At this moment, the latter had already opened his eyes. His face carried shock as he eyed Xiao Yan. When Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze swept over the other person\u2019s eyes, he was slightly startled as he saw that the other party\u2019s eyes were actually filled with a strange red glow that was mixed with some ferocity.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was not unfamiliar with this kind of red glow. As long as one trained for a long time within the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower,\u2019 such a condition would appear. Normally, this was called Fire Poison invading one\u2019s body. However, there was merely a little bit of red glow within the eyes of those people whom he had seen a couple of days ago. On the other hand, the fellow in front of him\u2026 the entirety of his eyes appeared to be filled with the red glow. Clearly, the Fire Poison had invaded deep into his body\u2026 Such a serious invasion of Fire Poison in one\u2019s body was the first one that Xiao Yan had seen until now.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are not buying, don\u2019t just randomly touch.\u201d The gray-clothed man blinked his red eyes as he coldly glanced at Xiao Yan. After which, he spoke faintly as withdrew his fingers placed together, appearing like a knife.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was a little amused by this attitude of the gray-clothed man. He shook his head helplessly within his heart. Now, he finally understood why the people around shunned this fellow. The buyer was actually nearly attacked when he took a look at the merchandise. Regardless of how high rank the items that he displayed were, it was likely that there was hardly anyone who dared to purchase them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said that I am not buying?\u201d Xiao Yan crossed his arms in front of his chest, and replied in a similarly indifferent tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t pay me lip service. If you want to buy, you can take out the \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 to buy it. Debating here and there and wasting time.\u201d An irritable feeling flashed across his reddened pupils. The gray-clothed man\u2019s hand suddenly slammed on the stone table as he spoke angrily.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe invasion of the Fire Poison into his body is actually this serious... even his mind has been affected by it.\u201d Xiao Yan was unconcerned about the angry rebuke of the gray-clothed man. His face became slightly solemn. It was really unexpected that the Fire Poison within the \u2018Blazing Sky Qi Refining Tower\u2019 was actually this strong. It appeared that he should be even more careful when he trained in the future even though he had the \u2018Green Lotus Core Flame\u2019 protecting his body.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow much does this green vine cost?\u201d Xiao Yan pointed at the strange Green Wood Celestial Vine and asked faintly. From how the other party had placed it in the most eye-catching spot, one could understand that this fellow actually knew the rarity of this thing. Hence, there was likely going to be some difficulty if Xiao Yan wanted to carelessly obtain it like in the past.</p><br/><p>\u201cFour hundred days of \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019\u201d The gray-clothed man replied in a cold voice.</p><br/><p>The moment the gray-clothed man said these words, the entire area suddenly became quiet. The gaze which each of them used to look at one another was like that in which they used to look at a lunatic. Four hundred days\u2026 this kind of large number was something that some people were likely unable to obtain in an entire year or even two years. Was this fellow\u2019s big appetite not a little overboard? Although they could also see that this green vine was a little unique, there would definitely not be some who believed that it was worth four hundred days of \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019</p><br/><p>Under this kind of sky-high price, forget about the surrounding observers, even Xiao Yan also involuntarily twitched his mouth. Four hubdred days\u2026 this fellow...</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m afraid that it is a little expensive, no?\u201d Xiao Yan swallowed the breath that was choked in his chest before speaking with a frown.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough I do not know what exactly this Green Wood Celestial Vine is, two Dou Wang class Magical Beasts fought to death over it. That is sufficient to prove its worth. Moreover, in order to obtain it, I nearly threw away my life. Therefore, four hundred days of \u2018Fire Energy\u2019 is not expensive. If you are really unable to afford it, please leave. Don\u2019t disturb me doing business.\u201d The gray-clothed man glanced at Xiao Yan and replied before waving his hand.</p><br/><p>Although the gray-clothed man spoke easily, these words of his still caused the crowd around him to be somewhat shaken. Snatching something from the hands of two Dou Wang class Magical Beast. This fellow\u2026 was indeed worthy of being the craziest person in the Inner Academy.</p><br/><p>Some similar surprise also flashed in Xiao Yan\u2019s eyes. The gaze which he used to look at the gray-clothed man had an additional seriousness. Xiao Yan asked himself and knew that if he was to completely rely on his own strength, he did not have much confidence in successfully snatching this kind of unique object from the hands of two Dou Wang class Magical Beast. This fellow in front of him might be arrogant and wild, but he did indeed have the means to do so.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you change it to something else? For example exchanging another item for it? I am unable to take out four hundred days of \u2018Fire Energy.\u2019\u201d Xiao Yan hesitated for a moment. The Green Wood Celestial Vine was a key ingredient in refining the \u2018Ground Spirit Pill.\u2019 Moreover, if he wanted to successfully swallow the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame,\u2019 the \u2018Ground Spirit Pill\u2019 was something that was indispensable. Hence, no matter what happened, he must obtain all of the necessary medicinal ingredients and Monster Cores needed to refine the \u2018Ground Spirit Pill\u2019 in his hands before he obtain the \u2018Fallen Heart Flame.\u2019</p><br/><p>The number of medicinal ingredients needed to refine the \u2018Ground Spirit Pill\u2019 may not be large, but all of them were extremely rare items. Take for example this Green Wood Celestial Vine. If he was to let it slip by today, Xiao Yan did not know just exactly when will he find it again. Therefore, he would naturally not easily give it up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes you can. I need Dou Techniques. Di class ones. Do you have any?\u201d The gray-clothed man did not hesitate with regards to Xiao Yan\u2019s suggestions. He opened his mouth and changed his demands. However, this price once again caused Xiao Yan and the surrounding students to be a little speechless. Di class. It was likely that there were not many students within this Inner Academy who had a Dou Technique of that class.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xiao Yan did indeed possess a kind of Di class Dou Technique. Moreover, it was an Agility type Dou Technique. However, this technique was also something that he needed to practice but did not have the time to do so. Asking him to use it to exchange for the Green Wood Celestial Vine caused him to feel as though it was cutting into his flesh.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s face was volatile as it continued to changed rapidly for awhile. Under the focus of the surrounding gazes, he shook his head and slowly said, \u201cI am also unable to take out a Di class Dou Technique\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The gray-clothed man glanced at Xiao Yan with disdain. He was too lazy to even say anything as he directly shut his eyes once again and ignored Xiao Yan.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xiao Yan being humiliated, the surrounding people involuntarily emitted low laughter. They felt that Xiao Yan\u2019s action of bringing himself grief was funny.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe does indeed have a strange temperament\u2026.\u201d Xiao Yan shook his head helplessly. He ignored the laughter around him and did not simply just leave. After standing for a long while in front of the stone table, a thought suddenly shook his heart. His gaze slowly swept over the body of the gray-clothed man.</p><br/><p>Around two minutes after Xiao Yan\u2019s gaze swept across the gray-clothed man, a powerful force that contained some anger suddenly surged out of the gray-clothed man\u2019s body. Under the sweeping of this powerful force, the expressions of the surrounding students observing the situation drastically changed as they hurriedly stepped back.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis fool is going to be out of luck. He actually infuriated that crazy Lin Yan\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe deserves it. He clearly knows that that fellow has the worst patience in the entire Inner Academy yet he actually dares to dawdle. Isn\u2019t he asking for a beating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut this fellow seems to be quite familiar\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>On top of stepping back, the surrounding students involuntarily felt some resentment for being implicated into the mess. At that moment, complaints and ridicule sounded.</p><br/><p>Under the powerful fury of that gray-clothed man, Xiao Yan\u2019s expression also changed slightly as he took a step back. His heart was slightly shaken. From just looking at this Qi, it appeared that the strength of this fellow was likely above that of a seven star Dou Ling.</p><br/><p>The fellow\u2019s tightly shut eyes were once again slowly opened. Those reddened pupils of his contained violence and anger. He eyed Xiao Yan and asked in a dark and cold voice, \u201cAre you asking for a beating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wish to fight. However, I have quite a bit of interest in this green vine.\u201d Xiao Yan shrugged his shoulders and laughed softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of the trading area in one minute.\u201d The gray-clothed man inhaled a deep breath of air. His voice contained some suppressed anger and violence as it shook.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t have four hundred days of \u2018Fire Energy, and I don\u2019t have a Di class Dou Technique\u2026\u201d Xiao Yan rubbed his head, feeling vexed. However, before all of his words sounded, the aura of the gray-clothed man completely erupted. The latter suddenly stood up. In an instant, he appeared in front of Xiao Yan. Both of his eyes turned red as the sharp wind of his fist nearly tore through the air. There was a faint pale red fist shadow along the path which his fist was swung.</p><br/><p>The aggressive force which came toward Xiao Yan caused his expression to change. His body, however, remained straight as his dark black pupils eyed the pair of eyes that had been corroded by Fire Poison. A calm voice was slowly emitted, \u201cHowever, I can help you expel the Fire Poison in your body\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChi\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The first which was wrapped by a faint red Dou Qi suddenly stilled just when it was around two inches in front of Xiao Yan\u2019s face. Along with the stiffened fist, was the shocked face of the gray-clothed man.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 what did you say?\u201d The bright redness in his eyes dimmed slightly as the gray-clothed man opened his mouth and asked in a somewhat trembling voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan\u2019s finger gently touched the fist in front of him. After which, he slowly put it down. Xiao Yan directly looked at this man who appeared to be quite strong within the Inner Academy and said indifferently, \u201cI will help you expel the Fire Poison in you and you give me this green vine. What do you say to this transaction?\u201d</p><br/><p>The expression of the gray-clothed man changed intensely when he once again heard Xiao Yan\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yan was unconcerned about the clash within the gray-clothed man\u2019s heart. He inserted his hands into his sleeves and quietly waited for the other party\u2019s reply.</p><br/><p>This area in the noisy trading area had descended into a temporarily silence. Those numerous gazes shot at Xiao Yan\u2019s body while carrying some shock. This fellow had actually subdued the craziest person within the Inner Academy\u2026 it was really somewhat unbelievable.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

This was not a rare restriction for a virtual reality game.</p><br/><p> Being able to change character appearance in game lessens the sense of physical immersion.</p><br/><p> Having always worn glasses he thought his face looked a little strange.</p><br/><p> Hyun-Woo contemplated and then adjusted his face structure a little.</p><br/><p> He chose the Human race. This was typically a very average choice in most games.</p><br/><p> Since he had not selected a profession and did not choose any skills, he would become a human aptitude for all professions.</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>- Please select your character\u2019s name.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p>\u201cArk.\u201d</p><br/><p> It was the name that came to him when he received his unit.</p><br/><p> He was using it in a biblical sense.

After canceling the tutorial, Hyun-Woo was enveloped in a bright light.</p><br/><p> At the same time his characters eyes moved and he was absorbed within it.</p><br/><p> The novice adventurer, Ark was born.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the heck?\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark had a bewildered look on his face.</p><br/><p> He was surrounded by mountains and mountain villages.</p><br/><p> In the village there were around 100 houses surrounded by high barriers.</p><br/><p> This must be the beginning town Harun.</p><br/><p> However Ark still could not believe his eyes.</p><br/><p> \u2018Is this really part of a game?\u2019</p><br/><p> He could not believe it. The surrounding mountains. The fences and buildings, even the people who were wandering around...</p><br/><p> This was completely different from Computer Graphics. It wasn\u2019t something you can see visually.</p><br/><p> He could feel his leather shoes, the wind whooshing by his ears, and even smell food being prepared somewhere from a distance.</p><br/><p> It felt like reality, but wasn\u2019t reality which made the situation all the more difficult to believe.</p><br/><p> \u2018I know this is a virtual reality, but I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s a game.\u2019</p><br/><p> The virtual reality gaming experience used to be solely based on retina graphics.</p><br/><p> This was as of 3 years ago. To this day most virtual reality games had still not escaped the dimension of having retina graphic based game.</p><br/><p> \u2018Now I understand why Director Ha Myung Woo spoke with prideful words.\u2019</p><br/><p> Just one month ago Global Exos had announced New World, which resulted in it becoming the hot topic of gossip in many other games. Now he understood why this was happening.</p><br/><p> If his situation had been more favourable, he would have stopped at nothing to play this game.</p><br/><p> The technology developed by Global Exos was incredible.</p><br/><p> \u2018Ah, now is not the time to be doing this.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark, who had his mouth wide open, wiped his drool.</p><br/><p> Several people around him look at him with dull look on their faces.</p><br/><p> They were going through the same process of adaptation as Ark.</p><br/><p> Blushing from embarrassment Ark moved to a more adequate place.</p><br/><p> \u2018Where should I head off now?\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark saw the way other people moved their bodies and copied them.</p><br/><p> Although he was actually connected to the unit lying down. He felt like he was actually moving.</p><br/><p> Although moving little parts of his body was rough, it process was similar to moving in real life.</p><br/><p> \u2018Ok, movements don\u2019t seem to require any special procedures\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark then investigated the system window.</p><br/><p> \u201cMenu.\u201d</p><br/><p> A translucent circle appeared in front of him listed various items.

Afterwards he confirmed his skill window was completely empty. The contents of his bag were; 10 units of water, 10 pieces of wheat bread, and a dagger.</p><br/><p> He was excited, and felt as if a new life was just beginning.</p><br/><p> \u2018Well, what should I do now.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark closed the information window and looked around.</p><br/><p> Everything was so much like reality it was hard to distinguish NPCs from normal users</p><br/><p> But both users and NPCs showed no interest in Ark since he began.</p><br/><p> Everyone was running around like crazy.</p><br/><p> In most games, there would be a kind NPC who would teach you when you first start out.</p><br/><p> Looking around for a bit, he spotted an old man who kept his eyes on him from a distance.</p><br/><p> Ark walked over to him.</p><br/><p> \u201cEx..... Excuse me.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYou must be new here.\u201d</p><br/><p> Without having to say anything, the old man spoke as if he understood the entire situation.</p><br/><p> \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cMy name is Ark.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cMy name is Hansen. I\u2019m just an old guy whose purpose in life is to teach young guys, such as yourself, how to live in this place. As expected, you probably want to ask about what to do in this place?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cMost people who are like you commonly work one of two jobs here. One is wild dog and wolf hunting outside of this village, and another one finding work in the village. If you\u2019re just playing casually, it\u2019s better to choose the latter option. Since this is a backwater village, we\u2019re always short-handed.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes, I like to be provided a job.\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark replied without hesitation.</p><br/><p> However, the greatest danger in a game is not learning how to hunt carefully and embarking without reason or under bad influence.</p><br/><p> Therefore doing a simple quest would be good idea to adapt to the game.</p><br/><p> Early beginnings of a game consisted of mostly of doing quests to adapt to the flow of the game and earn equipment. Hence, was more profitable than aimlessly hunting.</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019m thankful you took time to listen to me. As it so happens, there\u2019s a job I\u2019d like to entrust to you. Recently I\u2019ve heard the tavern owner was complaining about the amount of mice in his cellar. I think you would be able to solve the problem. How about it? Will you help?\u201d</p><br/><p> Du-du-dung. An information window came up along with a strange sound.</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>Kraydon, who owns the tavern in the gloomy backwater village of Harun, has gotten headaches over the growing mouse problem in recent years.Meet Kraydon, listen to his problem, and then deal with it. It\u2019s a job that should be easy even for a beginner.Difficulty: Not Applicable</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p>Ark accepted the quest and headed towards the tavern.</p><br/><p> Finding the tavern was quite easy. It was the only building overflowing with customers, in the town square.</p><br/><p> As he entered the tavern a messy haired boy wearing an apron could be heard yelling.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou came with a recommendation from the Old Man Hansen?\u201d</p><br/><p> With a relieved look on his face, Ark began to speak to Kraydon.</p><br/><p> \u201cNice to meet you. Can you do me a little favour and kill the mice inside the warehouse down the street. Lately, I think if I hear them one more time, I\u2019ll lose my mind!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes. I will do it. But what will the compensation be?\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark indirectly asked. Whether in it is reality or inside a game, no one believed in working free of charge.</p><br/><p> Work should be compensated. It\u2019s only natural right?</p><br/><p> Kraydon started beating on his chest and replied.</p><br/><p> \u201cOf course, I, Kraydon, am not of the cheap nature to swindle a stranger who has no home or belongings after he has eaten his fill. I have prepared a reward essential for someone like you.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI look forward to it.\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark entered the warehouse with a daring smile.</p><br/><p> The warehouse had been congested with many swarms of mice.</p><br/><p> Both sides officially recognized the other as an easy target as they faced one another.</p><br/><p> \u2018My first test subjects will be you guys! Now, shall we begin?\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark drew his dagger, charged and swung his dagger, and attacked one of the mice.</p><br/><p> However, he got a result he did not expect. Embarrassingly, the mouse lightly sidestepped the moving dagger. Also, as if mocking his sloppy display of skill, they ran between the boxes, knocking them over.</p><br/><p> Similar occurrence kept repeating. Ark was growing angry at the loitering mice who light dodged as often as he swung his dagger at them.</p><br/><p> \u2018Huh? There\u2019s no way this should be happening?\u2019</p><br/><p> How could he be unable to even kill one mouse? Ark grew puzzled.</p><br/><p> In all of the games he\u2019s played until now, mice were mobs who died out even if they saw a sword. However, these mice were different.</p><br/><p> As if they were actual copies, the mice moved as they would in reality. Their speed was no joke.</p><br/><p> While he was flustered, a bright light suddenly flashed in his eyes.</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>- You have been attacked by a Mouse.You have received 1 damage.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p>Far from killing them, he was hurt instead.</p><br/><p> Just because it was only 1 damage, it did not mean he could ignore it. The mice, seeing Ark getting flustered, seemed to judge him as an easy opponent. In an instant, enough had gathered to block the view of the ground and started biting him. In the blink of an eye, his health had dropped down to 20.</p><br/><p> Ark, who became frightened, quickly backed away.</p><br/><p> \u2018These little... If I\u2019m not careful, I might die from being attacked by mice.\u2019</p><br/><p> Nobody, in the entire world, gets bitten by mice and then dies from it.</p><br/><p> Ark calmed his emotions. He could not afford to get hit anymore.</p><br/><p> Ark carefully marked the assaulting mouse, and struck the moment they ran forward to bite him.</p><br/><p> The mouse screeched with pain and split into two halves.</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>- You have killed a Mouse. You have earned 1 EXP.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p>At last, he heard the welcoming sound accompanied a message window popped up.</p><br/><p> When Ark started to properly counterattack, the mice were eliminated at lightning speed.</p><br/><p> Meanwhile, Ark killed several more mice. He also drove them back to their holes one by one as he swung his dagger. The mice did not take it lying down.</p><br/><p> Several of them began to cooperate with one another, and started to leap at him after hiding in boxes and counterattacked. The fierce fighting between the human and the mice lasted 30 minutes.</p><br/><p> At the end of the battle, he only had 3 loaves of wheat bread left. In order to recover his lowered health, he had consumed 7 loaves. The durability of his 2 attack point dagger and his 2 defence point leather armour also dropped significantly. It was an empty victory.</p><br/><p> \u2018Phew, whatever happened, I killed them all. While it was difficult, my experience should\u2019ve risen substantially, right?\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark opened up his character window in order to inspect the good results and promptly had an unhappy expression.</p><br/><p> One mouse gave 1 EXP. However, even though he killed over 30, he only received 30 EXP.</p><br/><p> He thought because he was just starting out, it was not a small amount.</p><br/><p> However, after looking at his experience bar, it had not even risen one percent.</p><br/><p> No matter the extreme difficulty in fighting them, mice were mice.</p><br/><p> His disappointment was unrivalled. However, Ark reined in his emotions.</p><br/><p> Because no matter what, a quest was still a quest, there would still be some reward later.</p><br/><p> \u201cAll the mice have been wiped out.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cOh, yes? Very good. I have a little something for you.\u201d</p><br/><p> Kraydon laughed broadly as he took out 10 wheat bread.</p><br/><p> \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark who had been eagerly looking forward to his reward, stare at Kraydon in horror.</p><br/><p> There could be no way he would spend more than 30 minutes in a life or death struggle, all he would receive was some wheat bread.</p><br/><p> However, Kraydon, if anything, looked blankly at Ark as if there was something wrong with him.</p><br/><p> \u201cNo way, is there some kind of mistake?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cWhat do you mean? Isn\u2019t it most important you are still alive?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cBut\u2026\u2026.\"</p><br/><p> \u201cYou expect to receive better rewards for killing some mice?\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark had fevertion so he kept his mouth shut suffering in silence.</p><br/><p> He spent 30 minutes and cleaned up 7 loaves of wheat bread to hunt the mice.</p><br/><p> His dagger and his leather armour were in disrepair. And the reward was a mere 10 loaves of wheat bread? Was it a joke? But what use was there in arguing with an NPC for an opponent?</p><br/><p> Furthermore, wheat bread was cheap but inconvenient.</p><br/><p> However, Ark accepted and took the 10 pieces of bread and left the tavern.</p><br/><p> He returned to Hansen with a dissatisfied expression and asked him.</p><br/><p> \u201cAren\u2019t there any more decent jobs?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cHehe, this guy. You\u2019re being too greedy from the very start. You\u2019re a newcomer to this place. Who would entrust an important task to a newcomer? If you want a job with large rewards, you need to build more trust.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u2018It appears the game is affected by the level of intimacy\u2019</p><br/><p> Many games before virtual reality games emphasised on relationship between NPCs.</p><br/><p> It was a feature of the game that one\u2019s intimacy with an NPC determined which quests, information, and skills you would be exposed to.</p><br/><p> This kind of system played the role of an imaginary space where one could experience significance of reality.</p><br/><p> Therefore there was no way a high-tech company like New World would not implement a system such as this.</p><br/><p> \u2018In other words, newbies had to grind the low-reward quests in order to get better rewards.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark was about to ask another question after understanding the basic concept.</p><br/><p> Someone struck up a conversation from behind him.</p><br/><p> \u201cAre you a newbie?\u201d</p><br/><p> He turned around and saw a cute girl coming closer.</p><br/><p> \u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cAre you trying to get a quest from the elder by any chance?\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark nodded his head as a smirk rose on her face.</p><br/><p> However, as soon as Ark made an unpleasant expression, she quickly smiled.</p><br/><p> \u201cOh, sorry. However, trying to get a quest from the elder isn\u2019t exactly the best idea.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThe quests this elder provides are all low-reward and low-experience. Although I did a few of his quests just in case, he kept giving me similar quests. There are people who have also tried over fifty times. However, the only things they've received in increase were the repair costs.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThen what should I be doing in the beginning?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThe best thing to do is to hunt Wild Dogs in the outskirts of the village. While the normal thing is hunt rabbits or raccoons at level 1, the EXP you receive is only a little bit higher than mice... The reason why there is hardly anyone in the village is because everyone is out hunting wild dogs.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cWild dogs?\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark bore an anxious expression as he repeated the question.</p><br/><p> Just killing a few mice was an arduous task. Would not hunting wild dogs be more difficult?</p><br/><p> However, the girl opened her mouth as if she had read his mind.</p><br/><p> \u201cIt\u2019s hard to kill them alone. That\u2019s why everyone forms a party to hunt them. As it so happens, a person whom I was hunting with and I, were having a bit of trouble, so would you like to hunt with us?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYeah? Are you sure it\u2019s alright? I\u2019m only at level 1?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIt\u2019s okay. I also started today, so I\u2019ve only reached level 2. And the other person is level 3.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes, then please let me join.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cPlease follow me. The other member is outside.\u201d</p><br/><p> Her party mate was a large man who was eating wheat bread at the village gates.</p><br/><p> It was a rare sight for someone in the starting village to be equipped with a longsword.</p><br/><p> As she introduced herself, Ark quickly examined her from top to bottom and nodded his head.</p><br/><p> \u201cWell, at least a level three would be better than a level one and two.\u201d</p><br/><p> The man was Andel, and the woman was called Bulma.</p><br/><p> Both Andel and Bulma were also beginning New World but were more well-informed than Ark.</p><br/><p> Although he started around the same time as Ark, he was able to level up by forming a party and hunting wild dogs.</p><br/><p> \u201cWell then, we have no time to be playing around\u201d</p><br/><p> As they walked a bit, they came across a field where Wild Dogs were meandering in.</p><br/><p> Bulma said in a nervous tone.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou can\u2019t stop being vigilant everyday just because it\u2019s close to the village. They\u2019re stronger than they appear, so you have to kill them by luring them one at a time.\u201d</p><br/><p> As Andel silently drew closer to a Wild Dog, he hit it and escaped behind it. He was far enough so other Wild Dogs would not jump in, and swung his long sword.</p><br/><p> The wild dog howled in pain as it took the piercing attack.</p><br/><p> Meanwhile, Ark and Bulma sprang at it. However, the battle was not as simple as they thought. Their fear clouded their judgement.</p><br/><p> While one may say what kind of fear is there in a game, the Wild Dog, which was exquisitely detailed down to each individual hair, appeared no different from reality.</p><br/><p> In reality, he had never even fought a cat before. He had not even imagined fighting a Wild Dog, let alone actually fights one. Seeing those Wild Dogs bare their teeth at him chilled him down to his bones. Their movements were also alarming. They were so fast Ark, who was wielding a dagger, could not hit them even once.</p><br/><p> \u201cJeez, Ark. What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cUhm uhm, thi-this...\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark suffered a bite to his thigh as a result of the Wild Dog\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p> Immediately, he lost 30 HP. As he became frightened and started retreating, Andel and Bulma struck the Wild Dog from behind, barely managing to kill it. When the Wild dog fell, it dropped leather and meat.</p><br/><p> Andel naturally picked up everything then looked disapprovingly at Ark.</p><br/><p> \u201cIs this your first time playing a Virtual Reality game?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cNot really...\"</p><br/><p> It was his first time playing the real thing.</p><br/><p> Andel glared at Bulma with eyes full of reproach.</p><br/><p> Why did you bring back a guy like this?</p><br/><p> Bulma looked at Ark with a resentful expression.</p><br/><p> Ark\u2019s face became flushed as he suddenly became marked as a dead man.</p><br/><p> It was not always good to have a game be able to express every single expression.</p><br/><p> They had killed more Wild Dogs, but the results always turned out the same.</p><br/><p> \u201cArk, I can\u2019t attack if you suddenly come to my side!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cOh, are you really going to stab me?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYou want me to retreat back there? How am I supposed to attack?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cAh, but you\u2019re terrible.\u201d</p><br/><p> Andel had an annoyed expression as he complained.</p><br/><p> Ark got flustered and was chased by the wild dogs, and as a result, Andel and Bulma killed everything.</p><br/><p> Since he wasn\u2019t even able to properly stab anything with his dagger, he did not receive any experience. Even the leather and meat that dropped were monopolized by Andel, of course. While Bulma did not say anything, Ark, who was only causing trouble, could not even complain.</p><br/><p> No, it was not an issue of complaining.</p><br/><p> \u201cPlease take a moment to look at what we\u2019re doing from behind us.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u2018Damn, won\u2019t I get kicked at this rate?\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark grew restless at Andel\u2019s brusque tone.</p><br/><p> There are only 4 loaves left. His equipment was frayed as if it would fall apart at any moment.</p><br/><p> No party would pick up a player who got kicked out with Ark's appearance.</p><br/><p> His days of desperately fighting mice for 10 loaves of wheat bread and 1 EXP would continue.</p><br/><p> Furthermore, connections were important in games.</p><br/><p> If any person played a game, then they understand how important it is to have even one more person on their side.</p><br/><p> \u2018Fine. This time, I want to get a hit in and die with no regrets.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark had a firm resolve.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, another Wild Dog lured by Andel had arrived.</p><br/><p> Ark did not listen to Andel\u2019s advice at all, and, after taking the vanguard, swung at a Wild Dog with his dagger. As he fought it as if his life depended on it, the dog flattered and shrank back.</p><br/><p> For the first time, Ark was able to hit the wild dog with his dagger.</p><br/><p> At the same time, the wild dog\u2019s attack struck Ark.</p><div></div><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>- You have received a fatal blow from a Wild Dog.You have taken 50 damage.</td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p>Ark felt a dizzy sensation and staggered around before collapsing on his back.</p><br/><p> \u201cNot that way!\u201d</p><br/><p> Bulma shouted not because she was worried about Ark but because she was surprised. The Wild Dogs took a step forward towards where Ark had collapsed and began to gather.</p><br/><p> Bulma and Andel\u2019s faces were white with terror. Even with their level, the Wild Dogs were an overwhelming opponent. Even more so when there was 5 of them!</p><br/><p> \u201cDamn, it\u2019s all over.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThat\u2019s why you should stay at the back!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark overflowing with dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p> \u2018Damn, how about I quit the party.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark clenched his fists tightly until they bit into his hands and got up.</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019ll block them while you run away.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes? Ha, but then...\u201d</p><br/><p> Bulma was baffled as Andel pulled on her with a jerk.</p><br/><p> Without looking back, Ark drew out his dagger and swung it in random directions.</p><br/><p> Two of the Wild Dog who gathered around Ark, chased him. Simultaneously, he saw flashing red lights coming from all directions. When he heard three or four system messages saying he has received some damages, the vision from both his eyes started to turn dark. Not long after, Ark collapsed and the Wild Dogs retreated to their original position.</p><br/><p> His very first death.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>As he opened his eyes he saw some supplies near the castle gate.</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>- You have suffered critical injuries.Fortunately, you were saved quickly and received treatment at the Quartermaster's Station.Life will recover.

Did you almost die because of me?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cNo, it was thanks to you I\u2019m alive. But Ark\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIt\u2019s no problem. After all, I didn\u2019t even have 1% experience.\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark had never thought of his death was of any importance.</p><br/><p> It was common sense in the case of death in a game, experience would be reduced. In some cases, lose their items. This was the reason why people struggled to not be killed.</p><br/><p> However Ark was different. He did not care to lose experience since he had just started.</p><br/><p> Neither did he drop any of his items. The only players who did not fear death were level 1 players.</p><br/><p> Therefore Ark tilted his head since he was unable to understand Bulma\u2019s reaction.</p><br/><p> \u201cYes? What experience? I\u2019m just saying\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p> Andel, as if became aware of something, suddenly blocked Bulma's path.</p><br/><p> \u201cAh yes, I hadn\u2019t thought Ark-nim had just recently started the game.\u201d</p><br/><p> Andel\u2019s eyes sparkled as he proposed an idea.</p><br/><p> \u201cThen how about we do this? Let's hunt something a little stronger than Wild Dogs, something like Wolves. If it's Wolves, I'm sure we'll be able to take them down. I've heard there were some cases where a party was killing a Wolf and various other Wolves would come and gather around them making it almost impossible to hunt. But if Ark-nim were to tank them for us and die in our place, Wolves are worth challenging. Although Ark-nim will not receive any experience, we'll divide any items dropped from killing Wolves. The beginners' items they drop can be sold for a considerable amount of money.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cBut Andel-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p> Bulma looked at Andel with a surprised expression. Her eyes told him he asked for too much.</p><br/><p> Nevertheless Ark nodded his head without a second thought.</p><br/><p> \u201cIf you\u2019re sure, why not.\u201d</p><br/><p> He thought Andel\u2019s proposition wasn\u2019t a bad one.</p><br/><p> Even if he refused and left the party, there was nothing else he could do.</p><br/><p> It would be more useful if he was able to face a superior Wolf and adapt.</p><br/><p> He currently did not stand a chance; death was inevitable.</p><br/><p> For a good reason, he also wouldn\u2019t be distributed any items nor receive any loot unless Wolves appeared.</p><br/><p> \u201cIt\u2019s beneficial to have Ark-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p> Andel lead the party to the fields in high spirits.</p><br/><p> Andel's attitude towards Ark did a complete 180. In order to repair his equipment, he would have to pay 30 copper. And whenever situations get dangerous, he was grateful for reducing the chances of death. After the party finished their item repairs, they walked passed the pack of Wild Dogs towards the place where Wolves gather.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>Wolves, undoubtedly are several times stronger than stray dogs. It was an opponent you can barely win against yourself.</p><br/><p> *Aooo!*</p><br/><p> As several Wolves were caught and on death's door, they howled towards the sky.</p><br/><p> There is a reason for this. The distant Wolves would surge in to the support of their comrades.</p><br/><p> On all occasions it was the level 1, Ark, who bravely intercepted them.</p><br/><p> \u201cThese bastards. All of you come at me!\u201d</p><br/><p> Naturally they would frantically claw and bite as they lay down on the floor.</p><br/><p> But Ark refused to bat an eye.</p><br/><p> \u2018Huhuhu. Slaughtering as I please. After all I am a pitiful creature with nothing to lose.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark arose up like a zombie once more from the Quartermaster\u2019s Station and set out to hunt Wolves once more.</p><br/><p> After he died about ten times, an information window popped up along with a sound effects and shining lights.</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>- You have learned a new skill.Undying Will (Beginner, Passive):You have undergone countless lives and deaths; your mind is uncrushable and abundant with courage.<br/><p> While under critical conditions, piercing the enemy\u2019s weak point will break their concentration and allows you to heal faster than others.</p><br/><p> During times of crisis:</p><br/><p> +30% Critical Rate.</p><br/><p> +5% Recovery Rate.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p>\u2018Aha, is this a gift from the heavens?\u2019</p><br/><p> Would this lead to destitute? Though he had died several times, he never imagined of receiving a new skill.</p><br/><p> The quicker Ark separated the pack of Wolves, the fasted they died.</p><br/><p> The people who watched Ark hunted started making comments.</p><br/><p> \u201cWahhh. That person never seem to get tired.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIt\u2019s a brave warrior. A soldier. A level 1 veteran.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIs he out of his mind? Maybe doesn\u2019t know how to play this game?\u201d</p><br/><p> Sarcasm could be heard one time or another, and sometimes a voice of concern.</p><br/><p> \u2018Hmph. Those people do not know anything...\u2019</p><br/><p> However, Ark did not mind their words. Ark opened his bag and took a peek. Inside were filled with Wolf leather and meat. Seeing this reassured his mind.</p><br/><p> At level 1, he was adapting to Wild Dogs and Wolves while obtaining item drops from them. What problems can there be? Despite Andel and Bulma's higher level, Ark was not at a disadvantage.</p><br/><p> In others perspective, Ark might certainly seemed he was recklessly hunting, however, Ark was also gaining a lot of information.</p><br/><p> Andel and Bulma had never experienced playing a virtual reality game like this.</p><br/><p> The two current level 3 players originally thought Wolves were overwhelming opponents.</p><br/><p> However, the two players were expertly dealing critical blows. Following Ark's lead, they did not hesitate to swing their weapons and attack. Thanks to the level 1 player, they were able to hunt Wolves continuously for about two hours.</p><br/><p> \u2018Huh, what\u2019s going on?\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark had experienced something strange.</p><br/><p> Somehow, he started moving slower and slower over time, and felt out of breath. Although he wield his dagger, he lacked strength.</p><br/><p> It was as if he had several lead weights on his arms and legs.</p><br/><p> Bulma, who noticed Ark\u2019s movement slowing down over time down, had a sorry expression on her face.</p><br/><p> However, Andel who was still at a distance, said.</p><br/><p> \u201cPerhaps he is unable to continue since he is not familiar with virtual reality games. We should call it a day. Hunting grounds are dangerous when a party member is unable to move.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes, I guessed so.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIt was all thanks to you, hunting was easier. I will see you later.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cCan I... Register you as a friend?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cWe'll call you next time.\u201d</p><br/><p> In the end, Andel had left before he could say anything else.</p><br/><p> Bulma hesitantly approached him, took out a sword from her bag, and held it out to him.</p><br/><p> \u201cTake this. It's not a bad weapon to use, especially at the start of the game.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cAh. Thank you.\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark received the weapon and checked the information window.</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\" style=\"width:90%\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0 <table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\" style=\"width:100%\"><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"4\">\u00a0 <br/><p>Rusty Iron Sword</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"1\">\u00a0 <br/><p>Weapon Type</p></td><td colspan=\"3\">\u00a0 <br/><p>One-Handed Sword</p></td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>Attack Damage</p></td><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>5~8</p></td><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>Durability</p></td><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>30/30</p></td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>Weight</p></td><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>15</p></td><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>Restriction</p></td><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>None</p></td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>Strength</p></td><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>15</p></td><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>Agilitiy</p></td><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>15</p></td></tr></tbody></table><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\" style=\"width:100%\"><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"4\">This weapon has low durability and the rust made its damage weak.<br/><p> Relying on this sword to fight in a battlefield will lead to death.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> Ark was currently using a dagger with a damageof 1~3. Although it was an unnamed, lousy-beyond-compare, level 1 dagger, Ark was thankful for it. In addition, his bag was full to bursting with wolf leather and meat. On top of that, he had become more proficient with his skills. While his level stayed the same, his progress for the first day was pretty good. However, Bulma had a rather sorry expression on her face.</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019m sorry. Even though you suffered so much, I don\u2019t have anything I can give you, except this\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cNo, I\u2019m truly grateful.\u201d</p><br/><p> There was definitely nothing wrong with looking good in front of other users.</p><br/><p> If anything, it was good to slightly flatter users who were at a higher level than you. There was no other way to get an item at such a bargain otherwise. With those joyful feelings in his heart, Ark finished the first day of gaming.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

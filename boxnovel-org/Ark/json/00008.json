Since you\u2019ve steadily made use of our store all this time, I\u2019ll give you up to 5 gold and 40 silver.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, please give me 5 gold and 50 silver.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cEh, since you don\u2019t want to lose out on even a single penny. Fine, let\u2019s do that.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThis is why I like you, mister.\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark chuckled as he pocketed the money.</p><br/><p> In New World, even if stores were from the same village, they each had a different sale and purchase price. The prices were always inconsistent and depended on the inventory or market price. This was the reason why users looked for stores that would pay them more each time. However, Ark had only used one place while hunting in the Jackson area.</p><br/><p> Because of the experiences he had from living in Harun Village for half a month, he knew a bonus was added if he accumulated friendship with the shopkeeper for a long time.\u00a0</p><br/><p> In the beginning, there were times when it was disadvantageous, but at some point you\u2019ll receive 10% more money when you sell goods. When you buy goods, you also receive at least a 10% discount. In addition, if you first buy an item recommended by the shopkeeper, there were cases where they could give you up to the max 30% discount.</p><br/><p> This piece of information was known to only a handful of Merchants and users.</p><br/><p> \u201cIf you need money, rather than selling worthless wares, why don\u2019t you sell those Cat Gloves instead? I\u2019ll give you a good price for them.\u201d</p><br/><p> If he was familiar with the shopkeeper, there were times when the shopkeeper sometimes asked for a particular item. Thanks to these situations, Ark was able to determine the generic value of items even if he didn\u2019t trade with other users.</p><br/><p> \u201cNo, I\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll come again next time.\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark finished what he had to do and left the shop.</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019ve saved up quite a lot.\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark fiddled with his weighted pocket as he walked on the street.</p><br/><p> He had approximately 60 gold when he left Harun Village, but before he knew it, he had already saved up 120 gold.\u00a0</p><br/><p> The most costly expenses in New World for users were food supplies and repair costs. On the other hand, it was possible for Ark to save this much because he didn\u2019t spend money for ingredients when he made food, and his repair costs were halved by the Lord\u2019s exclusive Smithy.\u00a0</p><br/><p> However, the time had come to end those privileges.</p><br/><p> \u201cSo it\u2019s finally time to leave Jackson.\u201d</p><br/><p> By hunting in the Shadow Forest, Ark had finally reached level 30. The Rotting Wolves and Zombies were no longer much help in increasing his experience. Although the experience the level 30 Ghoul\u2019s gave were still okay, they were low in numbers. Be as it may, he still couldn\u2019t hunt the level 50 Reapers. It seemed like he had to move his hunting ground soon and look for a new quest.</p><br/><p> \u201cBefore that, there\u2019s a skill I\u2019ve got to learn.\u201d</p><br/><p> It was the repair skill.</p><br/><p> There were only five Smithies in Jackson. Near one of those places, there was the sole master NPC who taught the repair skill.</p><br/><p> However, he didn\u2019t know the exact location.</p><br/><p> They didn\u2019t go around wearing name tags just because they were master NPCs, so users were forced to personally wander around as they conversed with other NPCs, one by one.</p><br/><p> But who was Ark?</p><br/><p> \u2018When did I have time to waste like that?\u2019</p><br/><p> \u201cHey, Thomas. It\u2019s been awhile.\u201d</p><br/><p> As Ark waved his hand, Soldiers who\u2019d been passing by rejoiced and approached him.</p><br/><p> \u201cArk, we haven\u2019t seen you in for few days. When did you return?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cA little while ago. But do you happen to know a Blacksmith in the village who\u2019ll teach the repair skill?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cAre you talking about Norton? I know him. Go that way and cross the bridge, it\u2019s the first Smithy you see. But what are you going to do by learning the repair method? If you go to the castle, old man Corn fixes them for you cheaply. And even if you learn the repair method, it\u2019s not like you can fix them well right away. It\u2019s better to leave them to old man Corn.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019m thinking of leaving to go on a journey for a few days in a faraway land. Since it\u2019ll be rough if I overlook it, I\u2019m gonna learn it while I\u2019m in the village.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cFaraway?\u201d</p><br/><p> Thomas nodded as he looked at him sadly.</p><br/><p> \u201cWell, you are an outsider. Then be sure to at least visit the Lord before you leave. Stop by at our barracks too, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark waved at the parting Soldiers and turned around.</p><br/><p> At the sight, users in the area had perplexed expressions on their faces.</p><br/><p> For the most part, Soldiers weren\u2019t that friendly toward a user. They considered the user an existence whose only purpose was to cause trouble in the village. There wasn\u2019t a single user who had heard a Soldier asking them to visit the barracks.\u00a0</p><br/><p> It was only possible for Ark, who was a friend to the young Lord.</p><br/><p> In any case, Ark wasn\u2019t interested in the reactions of the users. Even if it was a small number, the only people Ark wanted to befriend were NPCs.</p><br/><p> \u2018Anyway, I\u2019ve learned what I needed. Looks like my pocket will become much lighter.\u2019</p><br/><p> A sigh flowed out of Ark\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p> Understandably, it took money to learn a skill from a master NPC. After looking it up on the forums, it costs 20 gold to learn the repair skill. Repairing wasn\u2019t possible with just the skill. Each material exclusive repair skill tool set was 10 gold. In Ark\u2019s case, it would cost 30 gold since he needed the metal kit, leather kit, and cloth kit sets.\u00a0</p><br/><p> In total, he had to spend 50 gold to be able to use the repair skill.</p><br/><p> This was the reason why the majority of users couldn\u2019t learn it in the beginning even though it was a useful skill.</p><br/><p> \u2018Although it\u2019s money I saved up...\u2019</p><br/><p> His insides soured since he had to use 50 gold of the money he\u2019d scrounged up.\u00a0</p><br/><p> However, if he went on a journey, the repair skill was absolutely necessary for a user with a profession that required them to hunt.\u00a0</p><br/><p> If users had to look for a Smithy every time they needed to repair, it would result to spending more money. If they accidentally forgot to repair, there was danger of breaking their equipment. Something precious will still be precious. It seemed all the more precious because he\u2019d wasted money every day on repair costs, whether it was in Harun or Jackson.</p><br/><p> \u201cCome on in. Is there something you need?\u201d</p><br/><p> When he arrived at the Smithy, a middle aged man with a long beard approached him.</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019ve come here after hearing that the owner of this place is the appointed mentor of the repairing technique.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cDo you want to learn the repairing technique?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYou\u2019ve thought well. It\u2019s common sense that an adventurer needs the repairing technique. There\u2019s nothing more of a dilemma than having your equipment go bad while on a long journey. Let me see your hands.\u201d</p><br/><p> Norton abruptly grabbed Ark\u2019s hands and quietly inspected them.</p><br/><p> Shortly afterwards, he shook his head back and forth.</p><br/><p> \u201cAlas, though it\u2019s regretful, it doesn\u2019t look like you can learn the repairing technique.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI can\u2019t learn it?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cLooks like you don\u2019t know much about it. The repairing technique isn\u2019t something anyone can learn.\u201d</p><br/><p> Norton gestured towards men who were swinging hammers in the Smithy. Unlike NPCs, looking at the random clothes they had on, there was no doubt they were users.</p><br/><p> In the case the repair skill, it wasn\u2019t a skill possible enough to learn with just knowledge. There were also cases where one had to personally try using the skill under the tutelage of an NPC in order to get accustomed to it. It seemed those guys had paid money and were grinding in order to learn the skill.</p><br/><p> \u201cLike those those, in order to handle the tools proficiently, you need the right strength and experience. If you swing your hammer without knowing anything, you\u2019ll just break your equipment instead. That\u2019s why I teach an experienced Knight the technique to handle metal, and experienced Merchant or Alchemist the technique to handle leather and cloth. Even if other people tried learning it, they can\u2019t even use it properly.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u2018Does that mean there\u2019s a profession limit on the repair skill?\u2019</p><br/><p> His heart plummeted.</p><br/><p> Ark\u2019s skills had all acquired automatically, or were learned through a quest. Therefore, he\u2019d never considered the possibility of there being a profession limited skill until now.</p><br/><p> Although he\u2019d occasionally seen terms with it being an unsuitable skill on the forum, he\u2019d thought that it was just referring to a profession specialty skill.</p><br/><p> But for the repair skill, which he considered was absolutely necessary, to have a profession limit\u2026</p><br/><p> Ark suddenly thought of the users who had opened stalls within the village.</p><br/><p> \u2018Clothes, I will neatly mend your leather armor.\u2019</p><br/><p> \u2018I\u2019ll make weapons of every kind and metal armor like new.\u2019</p><br/><p> They were people putting out signs of that sort and doing business.</p><br/><p> Ark had snorted when he saw users receiving repairs from them.</p><br/><p> Although the costs were a little less expensive than the Smithy, was there really a need to pay another person money to help them raise their skill? Also, if he saved some money, he\u2019d learn it himself anyways\u2026 Those were his thoughts.</p><br/><p> But now he understood the situation.</p><br/><p> For users incapable of learning the repair skill, they didn\u2019t have the freedom of choice. Although he was about to like his Dark Walker profession regret pressed forward again.</p><br/><p> \u2018Dammit, I didn\u2019t think not being able to choose a combat-related profession was this fatal!\u2019</p><br/><p> \u201cThen are you saying that if my equipment breaks in the hunting ground, there\u2019s no way for me to fix it?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cBy the looks of it, it seems you\u2019re a beginner. Come here,\u201d Norton said as he showed Ark the inside of the Smithy.</p><br/><p> \u201cIf repairing was possible with just words, my Smithy would have been ruined long ago, since rascals who learned the repairing technique from me could open stands and repair cheaply.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cSo it seems.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThe real revenue of the Smithy is actually this. If you just have this, anyone can repair equipment.\u201d</p><br/><p> Norton gestured towards merchandises neatly arranged on one side. It was a case labeled with the words \u2018Tool Box\u2019 even beginners could use.</p><br/><p> \u201cAs long as you have this Tool Box, it\u2019s possible to repair your equipment up to five times, no matter where you are. The General one is used for regular equipment, the Deluxe one for Magic equipment, and the Tool Box of Magic can repair anything above Rare. Of course, you can also repair regular equipment with the Tool Box of Magic, but it wouldn\u2019t make sense to do so. Ah, will you also try using this? They say this oil and whetstone have the effect of raising the performance of weapons and armor for a given period. Isn\u2019t that surprising?\u201d</p><br/><p> However, the price of the Tool Box was...</p><br/><p> Even considering the point that the Tool Box could be used five times, it was a price 1.5 times more expensive than repairing at a Smithy. On top of that, Ark\u2019s equipment was also the so-called Magic equipment, and his mantle was Rare.</p><br/><p> Even if he bought one to keep as a reserve, it would cost him a fortune, 35 gold.</p><br/><p> If he had to spend that much money every time he had used up the five repairs, made his consciousness fade.</p><br/><p> 'Are you telling me I have to squander the money I saved by hunting like crazy all on repair fees?'</p><br/><p> For the first time, he realized New World\u2019s outrageous prices.</p><br/><p> You couldn\u2019t fight without getting hit as you played, so even hunting took money. If you accidentally died and your equipment\u2019s durability was completely drained, it would take several times the money. The better the item, the more money it would take.</p><br/><p> Ark hadn\u2019t known about the hardship users had.</p><br/><p> He\u2019d always received a 30 percent discount in Harun Village, and in Jackson, he received repairs for half the price at the Lord\u2019s castle. He\u2019d never had to squander a considerable sum on repair fees. For the first time, he could understand the feelings of the people who entrusted repairs to a user in order to save even one penny.</p><br/><p> \u2018If they go hunting and can\u2019t fish out an item, they\u2019d be hard-pressed to buy even one wheat bread.\u2019</p><br/><p> Be as that may, he couldn\u2019t just break his equipment because he begrudged the repair fee. With tears in his eyes, Ark pulled out the money as he trembled. However, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to pass it over and stopped.</p><br/><p> \u2018This can\u2019t be. For me to so easily give up the money I saved like that\u2026!\u2019</p><br/><p> In reality, there was no part-time job that Ark hadn\u2019t done before.</p><br/><p> From general store to door-to-door sales, he was also knowledgeable in the business field. If there was one thing he\u2019d learned from doing those jobs, it was that it was stupid to buy merchandise for the asked price.</p><br/><p> Bargain, bargain, and bargain again. At the very least, when the shopkeeper said he\u2019d suffered a loss, then you\u2019d know you\u2019d just barely bought it at the proper price.</p><br/><p> \u201cCan you perhaps make a discount for me?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cDon\u2019t say something ridiculous. Because there\u2019s so many rascals repairing for half of our price in this area these days, I\u2019m barely making a living by selling this. Are you telling me to starve and die?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cBut because I\u2019m so poor right now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark tried putting on the most wretched expression.</p><br/><p> It wasn\u2019t even worth trying.</p><br/><p> \u201cI can\u2019t consider the individual circumstances of travelers like you. Well maybe. If you were to purchase the merchandise in bulk, I could make a small discount...\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIn bulk? How many are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI wonder? If you buy about 100 of them, I\u2019ll give you up to a 5 percent discount off the price. Sometimes there are merchants or travelers who save up money and buy like that. If you\u2019re short on money, why don\u2019t you try that as well.\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark\u2019s eyes flashed. It was because the keen sense beaten into him by a destitute life had caught the scent of money.</p><br/><p> \u201cI see. I understand. I will come again.\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark quickly left the Smithy.</p><br/><p> Of course, he had no thoughts of gathering users. He didn\u2019t have the confidence to gather scores of users, and even if he managed to gather the users and receive the discount, with 5 percent on 30 gold, it\u2019d only amount to just 1 gold and 50 silver. The discount was too small compared to the effort he\u2019d put in. But for Ark, no, just for Ark, there was another method that he could use.</p><br/><p> \u2018It\u2019s possible. It has to be possible. I\u2019m sure there wasn\u2019t something like a Tool Box in the Lord\u2019s exclusive Smithy. That means in the end, they probably buy the Tool Box from another place. Then there\u2019s no rule that says I can\u2019t be the intermediary dealer.\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark shortly sought out the young Lord.</p><br/><p> Then, with his most helpless and miserable expression, he cried out. \u201cMy Lord!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cWhy are you like this? I heard that you were going to leave to another area, but why do you have that sort of expression?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI was going to leave. However, a small problem came up. I couldn\u2019t cope with what I should do, so I sought the Lord out in order to at least consult with you.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cA problem? If it\u2019s something I can help with, tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u2018Huhuhu, I\u2019ve got him.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark had a satisfied smile as he chattered rapidly.</p><br/><p> \u201cActually, I was going to go on a faraway journey with people I know this time. Buying the necessary goods was entrusted to me. But I accidentally went and ordered too much of the wrong item. Later on, I tried to cancel the order because I knew I\u2019d made a mistake, but the shopkeeper had already gone and made the order so I had to carry the responsibility. The teammates who heard the news all said it was my fault and just ran off\u2026 waah!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThey betrayed their teammate and ran away just because of that? Aren\u2019t they men who don\u2019t even know of loyalty!\u201d</p><br/><p> As expected, the perfectly rigid young Lord was infuriated, like it was his own problem.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou can\u2019t blame them. It was all my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIt\u2019s because you are too kind. In the first place, for you to do such a chore\u2026 no, it\u2019s fine. It\u2019s useless to say something like that now. So tell me. What exactly did you order on accident?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIt\u2019s the Portable Tool Box.\u201d</p><br/><p> At Ark\u2019s reply, the young Lord soon put on a smooth smile.</p><br/><p> \u201cAah, what a relief. If it\u2019s an item like that, I think I will be able to help.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cHuh? From the Lord?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThat\u2019s right. There\u2019s a Smithy in the castle, but it can\u2019t make the Portable Tool Box. That\u2019s why every time an expedition goes out, it\u2019s an item we purchase separately. What good timing. Our stock has been falling, so I shall purchase them all. No, I may as well procure 100 each of the General and Deluxe. That way, your face will also stand out to the shopkeeper. The bill is of no consequence.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIf you do that, I would feel too sorry\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThink not of it. Didn\u2019t I say this? That I would help you anytime if you needed it.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThank you so much!\u201d</p><br/><p> The young Lord immediately pulled out a check worth 2500 gold.</p><br/><p> A new stat he hadn\u2019t even imagined formed along with cheerful music.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> A new stat has been formed.</p><br/><p> The Art of Communication (+5): You are able to achieve what you want with an ornate way of speech. The higher the skill, the easier you can persuade your target, and you can drag out an even greater benefit.\u00a0</p><br/><p> Stat distribution is impossible, and will only increase when you have succeeded in a negotiation, a bargain, or a special deal.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> Ark, who received the check, was smiling from ear to ear.</p><br/><p> He\u2019d thought it might be possible, but he hadn\u2019t even imagined that the problem would work itself out.</p><br/><p> The discount he would receive at the Smithy was 5 percent. Simply buying the wares with 2500 gold and delivering them would yield 125 gold. It was like finding a pot of gold on a clear day.\u00a0</p><br/><p> However, being satisfied with the gains in front of your eyes was something beginners do. The greater a profit you earn, the more profit you need to rake in.</p><br/><p> Ark found Norton and extended the check.</p><br/><p> \u201cGeneral and Deluxe, 100 of each. How long will it take?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201c100 each? And the delivery is to the Lord\u2019s castle?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes. But if it\u2019s this much, don\u2019t you think you should give me a 10 percent cut?\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark slowly began to make the arrangements for bargaining.</p><br/><p> \u201c10 percent, you say! What nonsense! Then I\u2019ll acquire a loss when I sell it. However, if you\u2019re on familiar terms with the Lord, in consideration of the next deal, I can make up to a special 6 percent cut for you.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cAlright. 8 percent! If you sell 200 of them in one transaction, won\u2019t a fair amount be left?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> Ark suggested as he waved the check in front of Norton\u2019s eyes. Norton, whose eyes moved to follow the check, finally blew out a sigh.</p><br/><p> \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll give you a discount of 7 percent. In exchange, I have two requests.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cWhat are they?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cOne is that you have to take the discounted amount in merchandise rather than money, since the bill you\u2019re paying with is a check. Of course you have to give in that much.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI understand. And the other one?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cActually\u2026 the materials for making the Tool Box have decreased, so I can\u2019t deliver 200 of them right away. A special material to produce the Tool Box. I roughly have enough of the other materials, but I\u2019m short on the material called Ailard. I\u2019ll do it if you go acquire some of that.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cWhere do I need to go to get it?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cAilard is an item that only a capable Alchemist can make. The Alchemist who does business with us is Raymond. But because his health has fallen these days, so he told me he couldn\u2019t go out and acquire the materials he needs for making the Ailard. He sent in a request to introduce him to a useful adventurer. So go find him first. He\u2019ll know if you tell him that I sent you.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI understand. But if I have to go acquire the material of the item I\u2019m buying myself\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cWhat a vicious fellow you are. I lost, I\u2019ve lost. I\u2019ll give you 8 percent.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThank you very much. And I\u2019m just saying this in case, but to the Lord\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019m a shopkeeper too. Don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark, who received Norton\u2019s assurance, went looking for Raymond. Just as he\u2019d heard, Raymond greeted Ark with a haggard and pale face.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou said Norton sent you? Although he acted like he hadn\u2019t heard until now\u2026 well, it\u2019s about time that the Ailard has dwindled.\u201d</p><br/><p> After explaining his personal musings, Raymond nodded.</p><br/><p> \u201cThe material you need to find is a mineral that looks like a red mushroom. It can only be acquired in a cave located deep within the Gran Swamp. You\u2019ll probably have to go all the way to the end. But keep one thing in mind. That is an extremely precious mineral. You must keep all information concerning the mineral a secret from other people. Do you understand what I\u2019m saying?\u201d</p><br/><p> *Thu-thu-thump*\u00a0</p><br/><p> A quest information window came pouring in like the flow of a tide.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> Alchemist Raymond\u2019s Request</p><br/><p> Alchemist Raymond of Jackson is producing Ailard for the Smithy.</p><br/><p> However, he cannot acquire the necessary material because he has fallen ill, so he has requested for you do the job.\u00a0</p><br/><p> Raymond has urged you multiple times to not disclose any information regarding the mineral to anyone.\u00a0</p><br/><p> As per Raymond\u2019s request, you must guard the secret until the completion of the quest. You cannot be in a party.</p><br/><p> Difficulty: F</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> \u2018So a quest can show up like this, too!\u2019</p><br/><p> Who would\u2019ve known that his plan to get the Tool Box for free would have been connected to a quest!</p><br/><p> \u2018Is it a quest that\u2019s only given to a person who orders several hundred of the Tool Box by himself? Then there probably aren\u2019t many people who have done this quest in the early stage.\u2019</p><br/><p> Catching the mice after getting behind was no different.</p><br/><p> If it was difficulty F, it seemed it\u2019d be possible to manage it himself.</p><br/><p> Ark agreed to the quest without hesitation. If just this quest was taken care of, he could cut 8 percent off the Tool Box price. The money alone that would fall into his hands was a whopping 200 gold! Since he\u2019d get 10 Tool Boxes of Magic for free, there was no reason to decline.</p><br/><p> Ark received a mark on his map and received a recovery potion and wheat bread, as well as 2 Deluxe Tool Boxes through his eloquent way of speaking, as advance payment. After packing them, he headed towards the Cave of the Gran Swamp.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> \u201cBat, go survey the inside of the cave and come back.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI got it, Master.\u201d</p><br/><p> At Ark\u2019s words, the Bat flapped as it flew into the cave.</p><br/><p> When he passed through the Gran Swamp, Ark was level 32.</p><br/><p> The Gran Swamp was a day away from Jackson and was a place inhabited by all kinds of swamp monsters. Even so, it wasn\u2019t difficult because he\u2019d raised his level quite a lot in the Shadow Forest, but the Slime was still a fatiguing opponent. Its body was made of acidic phlegm, so every time he fought it, his equipment durability dropped bit by bit. If he hadn\u2019t come with the Tool Box packed, he would have had to go in and out of the village countless times.</p><br/><p> \u2018Dammit, though one Tool Box is that expensive\u2026\u2019</p><br/><p> If a battle broke out with a Slime, he worried more about the repair fee than his Health.</p><br/><p> \u2018Anyways, it looks like I wasn\u2019t the first to discover this dungeon,\u2019 Ark muttered regretfully.</p><br/><p> An explanation about the cave had popped up, but a bonus didn\u2019t come in.</p><br/><p> Even a dungeon was cleared out once, monsters and item were likely to spawn again when time passed. But if you were unlucky, you might not be able to fish out anything. However, Ark didn\u2019t worry that much about it, since his most important goal was to finish the quest anyways.</p><br/><p> \u2018Since it\u2019s a job worth 200 gold, I can\u2019t be too cheap.\u2019</p><br/><p> Just then, the Bat came out of the cave.</p><br/><p> \u201cMaster. There\u2019s 1 person.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cA person? You mean a stranger?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYeah. He\u2019s coming out this way.\u201d</p><br/><p> Wariness settled in Ark\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p> You had to be more wary of a user than a monster. The saying that mankind\u2019s natural enemy was himself didn\u2019t just apply in reality. It was more so particularly in a remote place like this. In a place where there was no one to help, if he got caught in a high level\u2019s PK ambush, he\u2019d suffer without a squirm and that would be that.</p><br/><p> Ark waited with a tense face and soon someone walked out of the cave.</p><br/><p> As Ark confirmed the face of the other person, his eyes widened.</p><br/><p> \u201c... You\u2014you are?\u201d</p><br/><p> The other person also recoiled as he took one step backwards.</p><br/><p> The Warrior wearing plate armor was Andel.</p><br/><p> The name he\u2019d screamed countless times as he ground his teeth!</p><br/><p> Andel must have recognized Ark because he stepped back as he winced. Then, as if he was thinking of something, his eyes rolled back and forth. He was deliberating on how he should respond. After a long time, Andel must have decided because he furtively raised the corners of his mouth and began speaking.</p><br/><p> \u201cAh, I thought you were someone I\u2019ve seen somewhere. You\u2019re the person I partied with before. Did you say your name is Ark?\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark silently nodded his head.</p><br/><p> He wouldn\u2019t be satisfied even if he could immediately beat the shit out of this bastard. Well, how long had he actually waited to do just that?</p><br/><p> However, Ark suppressed his anger and endured it for now.</p><br/><p> He hadn\u2019t checked how strong the guy had become yet. If he thoughtlessly followed his emotions, he could be the one to suffer instead. He also wanted to see how Andel would approach him.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou were Andel, right?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cSo you do remember.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u2018Would you be able to forget if it were you?\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark barely managed to swallow back the curses that surged up.</p><br/><p> \u201cThat\u2019s good\u2014 I wanted to meet you once again.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cMe\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes, because it looks like I\u2019ve made a big mistake. Who would\u2019ve known your stats would decrease every time you die? After hearing about it, I went to Harun Village because I wanted to apologize. But you weren\u2019t there. I worried that you might\u2019ve given up on the game, but since you\u2019re all the way here, looks like you\u2019ve raised your level quite a lot?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u2018You didn\u2019t know? Apologize? You will soon, you damn bastard!\u2019</p><br/><p> In the end, what Andel was curious about was Ark\u2019s level. It wasn\u2019t possible to tell how his attitude would transform if he decided Ark\u2019s level was lower than his own. Ark answered vaguely.</p><br/><p> \u201cWell, just leave it at that. To be sure, I was extremely upset at that time. I even thought about whether I should really quit the game. But there\u2019s a circumstance that makes it so I can\u2019t quit, so I\u2019m doing whatever I can.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYou haven\u2019t been misunderstanding it, right?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cHuh? Misunderstanding what?\u201d Ark feigned innocence as if he didn\u2019t know what Andel was talking about.</p><br/><p> Andel scanned Ark up and down with a somewhat relief expression.</p><br/><p> With the Black Bear Mouse\u2019s Leather Armor, Cat Paws, and the frayed helmet and shoes he\u2019d picked up in the Shadow Forest, no matter what his ability was, as far as outside appearances went, he looked no different than a beggar.</p><br/><p> The only thing worth considering was the Blood-red Mantle flapping behind his back!</p><br/><p> Due to the enormous penalty from the Mantle, he couldn\u2019t wear it while hunting, but he\u2019d equipped it just in case after hearing the Bat\u2019s words that a user was coming out.</p><br/><p> Nevertheless, he wasn\u2019t at that great a level. The Andel\u2019s eyes, who\u2019d made that judgement, glinted slyly.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cArk-nim, if you have time, would you perhaps like to enter the dungeon with me?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThe dungeon?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI discovered this dungeon as I was passing by, but it\u2019s a little difficult alone, so I was going to come later with a person I know, but since Ark-nim is here, I think it\u2019ll work even if we go in. How about it?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI wonder.\u201d</p><br/><p> As Ark purposely pretended like he couldn\u2019t decide, Andel spoke up quickly.</p><br/><p> \u201cIf an okay item comes out in the dungeon, I\u2019ll give it to Ark-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIf you do that, I\u2019ll be sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cNo, let\u2019s do it like that since there\u2019s the happening from last time. Yes?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cWell, if you put it that way, then...\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark nodded. He couldn\u2019t known what Andel was secretly plotting, but Ark didn\u2019t want to let the bastard go. Even if he couldn\u2019t win by any chance, if he couldn\u2019t at least cut a knife scar in Andel\u2019s side after seeing the opportunity, it was obvious he wouldn\u2019t even be able to sleep.</p><br/><p> For that, it\u2019d be difficult if he made a party with him. There was the quest condition as well...</p><br/><p> \u201cGoing in together is good, but to be honest I don\u2019t want to make a party.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d</p><br/><p> Andel accepted readily.</p><br/><p> When Ark finished his negotiation, he look a step and entered the cave, and a read suddenly enveloped his body. Just as Ark raised his head with an alarmed expression, Andel scratched his head with a sheepish expression.</p><br/><p> \u201cAh, were you surprised? It's just that I was only checking your status window. Since we haven't formed a party, I can only assist properly after finding out Ark-nim's status in advance.\u201d</p><br/><p> 'Does this little shit really think I'm a pushover?'</p><br/><p> Sparks flew from Ark's eyes.</p><br/><p> It was common sense to use the [Detect] function, which allows to check another user's status window, after receiving permission beforehand. If they used the command without permission, one couldn't help but think that there was an ulterior motive. No, it was nothing new, but what definitely showed up were just Health and the main stats.</p><br/><p> The Blood-red Mantle of Dreams was an item that decreased all stats by -15.</p><br/><p> Andel must have thought that Ark's stats were low considering he was a level 32. In addition, there was no doubt Andel had judged that even his abilities and skills were also just as low. It didn't feel good to appear weak, but if it was a wary opponent, it was better to let them underestimate.</p><br/><p> As expected, Andel showed a relieved expression.</p><br/><p> \"It looks like you weren't able to restore all the stats you lost in the beginning.\"</p><br/><p> \"I just leveled up without knowing. Although I've already changed my profession, I'm in this state.\"</p><br/><p> \"What did you do as your job-change?\"</p><br/><p> \u201cIt is Thief-related.\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Ah, so that's why your Agility and Luck are high. Since I changed my profession to a Warrior, I will take the lead.\"</p><br/><p> Andel pulled out a longsword and raised his shield, and gallantly moved to the front. Showing his back like it was nothing was a sign of his confidence that he could win even if he was ambushed.</p><br/><p> It was proof he had completely lowered his guard concerning Ark.</p><br/><p> 'Hmph, just wait and see. You'll come to regret your judgement.'</p><br/><p> Just when Ark was having thoughts like that:</p><br/><p> \"Master, I don't like that human.\"</p><br/><p> He heard a displeased voice from his shoulder. It was the Bat. Ark had put the Bat on his shoulder, and left the Skull hanging on his side. Since Andel didn't ask, it seemed he thought they were ornaments.</p><br/><p> In any case, Ark felt affection towards the Bat for the first time.</p><br/><p> An ally he could believe no matter the situation\u2014 meeting Andel again made him realize anew how precious its existence was.</p><br/><p> Ark exclaimed to the Andel who was showing off his equipment, \u201cWow, looks like you\u2019ve raised yourself a lot in the meantime.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIt\u2019s nothing special. I\u2019m only level 35 now, jeez.\u201d</p><br/><p> Andel sprang into the cave with an arrogant expression.</p><br/><p> There were enormous numbers of monsters gathered within the cave. The Lizardmen or Goblins he\u2019d seen in the Gran Swamp charged at them in swarms. If it were Ark, he would have fought by hiding his body and luring one or two each time, but Andel set his shield in front and rushed in without care.</p><br/><p> Andel, who defeated two of them in an instant, immediately drank a restoration potion and defeated the rest of them as well.</p><br/><p> \u2018Hmm, you say that\u2019s level 35?\u2019</p><br/><p> \u201cEyes of the Cat!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark activated the skill towards Andel while pretending to use it on a monster. As he expected, the level of Andel, who\u2019d job-changed to Fighter, was a staggering 43.</p><br/><p> On top of that, his defense was enormous because he was equipped with a plated armor and a shield. In actuality, even when he fought three or four monsters, his Health didn\u2019t decrease by much.\u00a0</p><br/><p> What was more surprising was that Andel\u2019s name was marked in red.</p><br/><p> Chaotic character\u2014 in other words, it meant he had a history of having PKed.</p><br/><p> Though well, if it was Andel, it wasn\u2019t something that surprising.</p><br/><p> \u2018It was good that I didn\u2019t thoughtlessly attack him after all.\u2019</p><br/><p> However, it was too early to relax. Andel\u2019s ploy was too obvious.</p><br/><p> It was a ploy to use Ark in a dungeon that was difficult to penetrate alone. Saying he would give the decent items to Ark if one ever dropped, was the same as meaning of him saying he would kill him if a decent item showed up.</p><br/><p> \u2018Even so, I can\u2019t withdraw here. So I have carefully look at the way he is fighting. The only way I can win against an opponent with an over 10 level difference is by planning a good strategy.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark meticulously inspected Andel\u2019s movements while fighting halfheartedly.</p><br/><p> Once he saw Ark panting with one monster as an opponent, Andel became even more triumphant and sprang forward wildly.</p><br/><p> It was the typical Warrior\u2019s fighting method of pushing forward with Strength, Stamina, and defense. That was the reason why he couldn\u2019t break through this level of dungeon even though he was a level 43.</p><br/><p> Instead of setting a strategy and handling them one by one like Ark, he set his attack power and defense in front and charged in extravagantly.</p><br/><p> \u2018That way might be the answer if it was another game, but this is New World. You still don\u2019t really know New World\u2019s combat. That is my key point of winning.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark followed Andel\u2019s back as he unremittingly set up a strategy inside his mind. In the first place, since it was a dungeon he\u2019d come to through an F difficulty quest, the level wasn\u2019t that high.</p><br/><p> As the level 43 Andel received Ark\u2019s assistance, the aggravated monsters were soon cleared. And when nearly 2 hours had passed, the two defeated at least a hundred odd monsters and arrived at the last part of the cave.</p><br/><p> \u201cI see the end now. It\u2019s thanks to Ark-nim.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cOh no, there\u2019s not much I\u2019ve done, jeez.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cBut compared to the difficulty, a worthwhile item hasn\u2019t come out. Although I have to give it to Ark-nim\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cPlease do not worry about it. And it\u2019s not like we\u2019ve reached the end yet, either.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThat\u2019s true. Then let\u2019s hurry and finish it.\u201d</p><br/><p> It was when Andel, who\u2019d finished restoring, stood up.</p><br/><p> *Kuuoooooo!*</p><br/><p> Suddenly, with a roar that shook the cave, a warning message popped up.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><div></div><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> - The boss monster Crystal Golem has appeared!</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> An enormous hand reached out all of a sudden from behind the corner.</p><br/><p> It was a hand that looked like boulder chunks had been clumped together.</p><br/><p> As if led by that hand, a monster with a gargantuan body rounded the corner. It was a Golem made of gathered boulders that gave off a bluish light. The Golem rolled its red eyes, and after scanning Ark and Andel, it loosed a shout with a harsh voice.</p><br/><p> \u201cFOOD!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cBe careful!\u201d Andel yelled as he drew up his shield.</p><br/><p> With a loud bang, Andel was pushed back. Ark quickly went behind the golem\u2019s back and stabbed with his sword.</p><br/><p> The Golem however only shrugged it\u2019s shoulder. It did not seem to have received a significant amount of damage.</p><br/><p> When Andel called the status check command, a health bar appeared above the Golem\u2019s head. The Heath that Ark\u2019s attack had decreased was just 1 percent.</p><br/><p> \u201cArk-nim, please give me support!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIf it\u2019s Andel-nim, you can surpass your wound and defeat the Golem!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark unfurled the Nursing skill as he nodded his head.</p><br/><p> Andel\u2019s sword, who received vigor and courage, and even a minor blessing, struck the Golem as it sliced through the air. With a massive cry, the Golem took a few steps back. At one blow of the Warrior with up to 200 Strength, they could see the Golem\u2019s Health drop significantly.</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019ll block from the front, so please guard my back!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark and Andel\u2019s series of attacks unfurled. Andel struck the Golem squarely as he set his shield in front, and as the high Agility Ark sought critical hits from behind the Golem, consecutive attacks unfurled.\u00a0</p><br/><p> Andel was definitely strong. Due to having his whole body plastered in plate armor, his defense was also considerable, and he must\u2019ve had ample funding because if his Health wore down even slightly, he downed a recovery potion. That was a luxury that Ark, who trembled at even 1 copper, couldn\u2019t even imagine.</p><br/><p> However, the battle was not concluded easily. The Golem was strong to the point of not matching the dungeon\u2019s difficulty, so strong that Ark couldn\u2019t have possibly faced it if he were alone.</p><br/><p> But with the two\u2019s concentrated attacks, the Golem\u2019s Health also steadily neared the bottom.</p><br/><p> At the sight of the Golem wavering, Andel loosed the Warrior-type kill that he\u2019d been saving.</p><br/><p> \u201cCharge, crush of Strength\u2014 Warrior\u2019s Blow!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ba-ba-baaang, the Golem took a big step back as its body cracked again and again at the blow.</p><br/><p> When Ark\u2019s attack struck as a critical hit from behind, the Golem finally couldn\u2019t withstand it anymore and collapsed.</p><br/><p> Andel and Ark\u2019s levels simultaneously went up by 1 each.</p><br/><p> Once the Golem collapsed, a single helmet and a mineral in the shape of a red mushroom were dropped as a brilliant burst of light shimmered out.</p><br/><p> \u201cWe won!\u201d</p><br/><p> Just then, Andel hurriedly took out and drank a recovery potion.</p><br/><p> He did so even though there wasn\u2019t even one monster around them. No matter how paralyzed he was about money sense, there was no need to handle something he could\u2019ve done with one wheat bread without even a reason.</p><br/><p> Just as expected, Andel suddenly swung his sword toward Ark, who\u2019d approached to check the items. But the Ark who\u2019d been expecting his attack quickly stepped back and glared with a sharp gaze.</p><br/><p> \u201cSo now you reveal your true colors.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cMwahaha, then did you really think I\u2019d simply hand over boss-drop items?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t believe you.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThen there\u2019s really nothing to resent me for.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019ll just ask one thing. Even when I was dying in Harun Village, you knew that the stats were decreasing, right?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cOf course. Wasn\u2019t the guy who was tricked without knowing an idiot?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cSay what you want, because this time, I\u2019ll make you want to give up the game.\u201d</p><br/><p> Andel\u2019s eyes gleamed with bloodthirst as he charged towards Ark.</p><br/><p> Ark blocked the sword with all his might. Ark\u2019s sword was helplessly pushed back because the strength difference was too great.\u00a0</p><br/><p> However, Andel\u2019s continuous attacks were all the same. Because unlike Ark, who\u2019d got by studying countless fighting methods in difficult situations, Andel was the type who raised his fighting ability merely through level ups.</p><br/><p> If they were the same level, he probably wouldn\u2019t have even be a match for Ark. But in the game, there was a way to overcome a difference of 11 levels with just ability. In some way or another, the reason this situation was unfolding like a battle was because Ark received an ability bonus of 20 percent in the dark.\u00a0</p><br/><p> Andel had an expression which seems to be saying he couldn\u2019t understand the situation.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou persistent bastard, let\u2019s see how long you can last!\u201d</p><br/><p> Finally, after receiving hits on several occasions, Ark's Health had been slashed by 50%, whereas Andel's Health had only decreased by 20% due to his plated armor.</p><br/><p> Seeing Ark had be overcome, Andel sneered.</p><br/><p> \"Did you think I didn't know anything? When we first walked into the cave, you used a Thief skill 'Detect' on me, right? You stupid bastard, you obediently followed me in even after checking my level. At that time, it was already predetermined you would die. Charge of Strength, Warrior's Blow!\"</p><br/><p> Andel used the skill with a triumphant voice.</p><br/><p> As the skill registered in rapid succession, in one blow Ark entered the critical state as his Health neared zero.</p><br/><p> \u2018Now is the time!\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark's eyes flashed.</p><br/><p> It was just as Andel said. When he'd checked the bastard's level, Ark had agonized over whether he should run or not. But he didn\u2019t run.</p><br/><p> The first reason was his hatred toward Andel, the second was he had been sure there was a method to take Andel down. And that a method that could only be used now, while in a critical state.</p><br/><p> \u201cEyes of the Cat!\u201d</p><br/><p> As Ark's eyes colored with golden light, red points marking Andel\u2019s weak points appeared all over his body.\u00a0</p><br/><p> Sure enough, perhaps because he was a Warrior who invested while believing only in his level and defense, his entire body was riddled with weak points. As an effect of the skill, his Health also appeared. Andel's consumed Health up until now was just 35 percent.</p><br/><p> But now was the start!</p><br/><p> \u201cDark Blade!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark's sword moved fluidly in the dark and lodged itself in Andel's nape.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> - A critical hit ignoring all defenses has been delivered!</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> Bewildered, Andel took a step back. Ark succeeded in another Dark Blade attack in an instant as he took one step forward. In the blink of an eye, Andel's Health plummeted by 50 percent.</p><br/><p> Ark's learned skill was a result made of 5 simultaneously overlapping buffs.</p><br/><p> The very first one that applied was the 20 percent ability increase within the dark. The next ones were raising the attack power and critical hit rate by detecting the weak spots with Eyes of the Cat, and the Undying Will and Indomitable Body that were invoked in the critical state swiftly increased the numbers once more.</p><br/><p> The final touch was a Dark Walker's profession skill, Dark Blade!</p><br/><p> It was a skill which ignored defense and raised attack power of critical hits by 150 percent. Although he didn\u2019t defeat the 15 level higher Andel in one fatal hit, with the combined increase from the linked effects, with two attacks he slashed Andel\u2019s Health down by 50 percent.</p><br/><p> The reason why he\u2019d endured without using his Mana until he\u2019d fallen into the critical state was solely for this moment.</p><br/><p> It was an act of burning one\u2019s bridges that only Ark, who had grown from only fierce battles, could use!</p><br/><p> Andel\u2019s face blanched.</p><br/><p> \u201cGasp, ho-how can this be!\u201d</p><br/><p> Andel urgently used the [Detect] command.</p><br/><p> Then, as he soon checked Ark\u2019s remaining Mana, he heaved a sigh of relief. Due to having used Eyes of the Cat and Dark Blade twice, he didn\u2019t have any Mana left. Whereas Ark\u2019s Health had 5 percent left now, Andel still had 15 percent left.</p><br/><p> \u201cHng, looks like your last-ditch effort ends here. Since you don\u2019t have much Mana left, you can\u2019t use your skills, either.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cDo you really think so?\u201d</p><br/><p> A cold smile touched Ark\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p> \u201cBlood-red Mantle of Dreams!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark was enveloped as the scarlet mantle suddenly flared out.</p><br/><p> Simultaneously, Ark\u2019s Health had recovered 100 percent. With his Health suddenly restored, Andel had a flummoxed expression. But the truly surprising thing was from then onwards. After that, Andel\u2019s swung sword attacks all deflected off the mantle.</p><br/><p> The ability of the Blood-red Mantle of Dreams to nullify all attacks for 10 seconds! There wasn\u2019t much meaning in monster hunting, but if the opponent was a user, it demonstrated absolute power.</p><br/><p> Andel\u2019s eyes flared with astonishment</p><br/><p> \u201cN-no way\u2026 are you saying that mantle was a Rare item?\u201d</p><br/><p> It was true. Ark hadn\u2019t just equipped the mantle to hide his stats. And in order to use the mantle\u2019s ability, which could only be used at night, Ark had purposefully drawn out the time.</p><br/><p> Andel, who realized for the first time that something had gone wrong, hurriedly pulled out a recovery potion.</p><br/><p> Ark\u2019s eyes froze with urgency.</p><br/><p> \u2018He can\u2019t. The mantle\u2019s effect is already over. If the bastard drinks the potion, I can\u2019t predict the outcome.\u2019</p><br/><p> \u201cSummon Demon, Bat! No matter what you have to do, block that bastard! If you don\u2019t, I\u2019ll make you eat food without rest for ten days!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cEeeek! No way!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> As the Bat was summoned, it flew rapidly at Andel.</p><br/><p> And then, it hurled and shoved itself into the mouth of Andel, who\u2019d been trying to drink the recovery potion.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou did well. Bat!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark unfurled his Dual-Blade Combat and toppled Andel. Then he stepped on both of Andel\u2019s hands and raised his sword.</p><br/><p> After smiling coldly, Ark thrust his sword down without hesitation.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cKuhuk, y-you little shit\u2026 Just wait and see!\u201d</p><br/><p> After those words, Andel sagged weakly. He died and was forced to log out.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> - You have defeated a level 44 Chaotic player.\u00a0</p><br/><p> - Fame +30.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> Ark released the breath he\u2019d been holding in one burst.</p><br/><p> He\u2019d finally gotten his revenge. And it\u2019d been against an opponent 11 levels higher!</p><br/><p> When the battle tension settled down, an electrifying pleasure swept down his body.

When a user died from PvP, there was a penalty of their body not disappearing for 24 hours and they couldn\u2019t log in as well.</p><br/><p> It blocked revenge ploys that had been problematic in online games on several occasions and was considerate of giving the victor time to enjoy their win.</p><br/><p> However, this kind of penalty had more meaning to Ark.</p><br/><p> \u201cWait and see? Hah, how funny. You picked the wrong guy to mess with.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> Ark immediately returned to Jackson Castle.</p><br/><p> While he was waiting at the right time near the Quartermaster, Andel appeared with white light.</p><br/><p> As expected, he\u2019d set his resurrection place to Jackson, which was close to the dungeon. It was well worth seeing him standing there robbed of his shoes, barefooted in his plate armor.</p><br/><p> Andel, who noticed Ark, flinched in surprised and his body began to tremble.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cY-you, you bastard\u2026\u2026!\"</p><br/><p> \u201cWhy are you so surprised? Didn\u2019t you say wait and see?\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark sprang up and rushed at Andel.</p><br/><p> Even though users were starting a fight right in front of the village, the Soldiers turned a blind eye.</p><br/><p> That was yet another penalty that Chaotic users received.</p><br/><p> Normally, if users fought amongst themselves near the village, they\u2019d be attacked by a Soldier. However, there were exceptions.</p><br/><p> One was if a normal user were to attack a Chaotic user first. A fight like this was far more advantageous for the normal user. When the normal user was pushed back, all they had to do was flee to the village. But the Chaotic user couldn\u2019t enter the village or chase them in either, and on the flip side, they had no where to run.</p><br/><p> That was the reason why users feared becoming Chaotic.</p><br/><p> Ark beat up Andel without mercy.</p><br/><p> Similar to their previous battle, he landed critical hits continuously in the critical state and became invincible through the mantle\u2019s power when he was in a pinch.</p><br/><p> The stat penalty was doubled if you were killed by a user. Therefore, it meant all of Andel\u2019s stats had been cut by 2. Andel, who also had lowered defense because he even lost the Steel Greaves, crumbled feebly.</p><br/><p> He was a user who wasn\u2019t like Ark who had real skills, but had gotten by through the strength of his stats and items.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou mongrel, you\u2019re dead...\"</p><br/><p> Andel babbled nonsense as he dropped more of his armor.</p><br/><p> Ark snickered as he stored the item. Then, after hunting while roaming around the area, he camped at the resurrection site and waited when exactly 24 hours had passed. It seems Andel didn\u2019t even considered Ark might be waiting for him there again. It was truly a delusion.</p><br/><p> \u2018Don\u2019t make me laugh, how long do you think I\u2019ve waited for this day!\u2019</p><br/><p> When he fought Andel, who didn\u2019t even have shoes, armor, and had -4 stats, soon he didn\u2019t even need the mantle\u2019s ability. As soon as Eyes of the Cat and Dark Blade went into a continuous combo, Andel collapsed listlessly. The bastard must\u2019ve realized the severity of the situation at last because next time, he didn\u2019t log in even though 24 hours had passed.</p><br/><p> \u2018Hah, you\u2019re saying we should see whose patience is greater, right? If the bastard is an applicant, he probably won\u2019t be able to endure not logging in for a few days.\u2019</p><br/><p> For the first time in his life, Ark went as far as to submit a week-long vacation from work.</p><br/><p> \u2018If you mess with me, I\u2019ll definitely repay you.\u2019</p><br/><p> \u201cPlease, let\u2019s talk a little. I will apologize. Please?\u201d Andel, who\u2019d logged in within 30 hours, spoke submissively.</p><br/><p> After ignoring Andel\u2019s plea and beating him, he dropped gloves. After killing him two more times like that, Andel became completely naked.</p><br/><p> Although Andel tried begging in the end, Ark didn\u2019t say a single word and silently raised his sword. Then, after he immediately started fighting when Andel logged in, making it impossible for Andel to replace his equipment and finish logging in, he rained regular attacks on him and razed him to the ground.</p><br/><p> Ark killed him six times during his vacation and killed him a total of eight times. Of course, Andel lost his plated armor set and even his sword. Then, from the seventh time onwards, there weren\u2019t any equiped items to drop, so he began dropping japtem inside his bag.</p><br/><p> Andel lost 96 stats and became truly penniless, whereas besides the time when he was waiting, Ark focused on hunting and raised his level by 2 instead. It couldn\u2019t even be called a fight anymore, but it got closer to a one-sided slaughter.</p><br/><p> Finally, as if Andel had completely lost motivation, he logged in after a whole two days had passed.</p><br/><p> Now Andel was forced to choose between recovering 96 stats by catching mice, or quitting the game. And no matter what he chose, it was certain that it would make it extremely difficult for him to pass the exam.</p><br/><p> \u201cAlright, it\u2019s not enough yet, but this time I\u2019ll let you off here.\u201d</p><br/><p> Only then did Ark got up from the resurrection site as if he were being generous.</p><br/><p> Ark then turned towards Andel who was slumped with a cowed and despaired face, he growled,</p><br/><p> \u201cIf I catch sight of you next time, it won\u2019t end like this. I\u2019m stopping here this time, but if I see you in another place, I\u2019ll kill you until your stats become 1.\u201d</p><br/><p> Andel\u2019s face went white with terror.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

It wasn\u2019t far from the village. Ark left Lancel after organizing his bags and arrived at the destination in only an hour.\u00a0</p><br/><p> Two Gnolls were standing guard at the entrance of the cave. They were slightly different from the Gnolls he had hunted until now as they were wearing shabby leather armor. It was likely they were about 1 or 2 levels higher than him. But he had hunted Gnolls until he was sick of it. Though their levels were slightly higher, they weren\u2019t a match for Ark.</p><br/><p> \u201cGrrrr, isn\u2019t there some kind of smell?\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Sniff, sniff. I was thinking the same thing.\"</p><br/><p> \"It smells like a human... Are there still humans lingering nearby?\"</p><br/><p> \u201cLet\u2019s catch him and make him into a sacrifice.\u201d</p><br/><p> Perhaps because they had dog heads, Gnolls had a keen sense of smell.</p><br/><p> The Gnolls raised their spears and, with their noses quivering, approached Ark\u2019s location.</p><br/><p> At that moment, Ark jumped out from behind the bushes.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou bitches are the sacrifice. Bat, go!\u201d</p><br/><p> Bat shot towards the Gnolls like an arrow that had been loosed from a bow. With a *pa-thump* sound, the Gnoll who had been struck on the bridge of its nose tumbled to the ground. The other Gnoll was alarmed and thrust its spear towards Bat.</p><br/><p> But the Bat who had his summon cancelled and then recast was already sitting on Ark\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p> \u201cEyes of the Cat! There isn\u2019t time. We\u2019re going with plan A!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark, Skull, and Bat sprang forward in a flash and concentrated their attack on the stumbling Gnoll.</p><br/><p> They had become familiar with Gnolls through battles, so predicting their movements was easy.</p><br/><p> Even before the Gnoll moved, Ark made evasive movements and let loose a chain of sword attacks. As a critical hit and co-op attack bonus erupted in succession, the Gnoll died before it was able to properly thrust its spear even once.</p><br/><p> The Gnoll staggered and charged in, but instead it received several counterattacks, lost 80 percent of its health, and ran away terrified. The Gnoll was consumed by fear and ran away frightened. But Bat rushed forward to block its path, and when Skull tore into its leg, it fell to the ground again.</p><br/><p> Double critical chance!</p><br/><p> \u201cGaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p> The Gnoll received a strike to the heart and disappeared with a moan.</p><br/><p> As the Gnoll disappeared it dropped a leather.</p><br/><p> \u201cHuhuhu, it\u2019s too easy, and this is 20 Silvers a piece?\u201d</p><br/><p> A smile spread across Ark\u2019s lips as he held on to two pieces of leather.</p><br/><p> 20 Silver a piece, so it was an item worth 2,000 Won (~$2). He was literally picking up bills that had fallen to the ground, how could he not be happy.</p><br/><p> \u201cMaster, those eyes are creepy.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cShut up, what do you know? One of these leathers can become a full sushi roll! That\u2019s an entire meal.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cSushi roll? What\u2019s that?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. Cut the small talk and do the recon well,\u201d Ark snorted as he entered the cave.\u00a0</p><br/><p> When he stepped foot in the cave, an information window popped up with a booming roar.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> Ghastly Snake Lair</p><br/><p> At the edge of the Argus Mountains, you have found a cave emanating a ghastly aura. The chilling aura you can feel from the cold blood flowing through these reptiles and an eerie smell permeates the entire cave. The noise of dogs barking can be heard from the depths of the cave, and slithering sounds are flowing from the small holes drilled everywhere.</p><br/><p> There is no way to guess how many Gnolls and Snakes are inhabiting the cave. If you are someone with the wisdom to avoid danger, you will never enter this cave.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> \u00a0</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> You have discovered an undiscovered dungeon. Because this is a newly found discovery, if you register your discovery in the Hall of Fame, you can gain an additional 700 experience and 50 Fame.\u00a0</p><br/><p> Would you like to register it?</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> \u201cRegistration refused.\u201d</p><br/><p> Of course, Ark had absolutely no intention to share the information.</p><br/><p> After refusing the registration, he entered the cave and found himself in darkness.</p><br/><p> He would have hated it in the past, but presently Ark was a Dark Walker.</p><br/><p> The dark was Ark\u2019s irreplaceable weapon and armor. Outside when it turned night time, Gnolls\u2019 stats rose by 30 percent. As a result, even though Ark\u2019s stats also rose, Gnolls were still stronger.</p><br/><p> But right now it was daytime. So only Ark was strengthened from the cave\u2019s darkness. His strength was replenished and he felt his five senses becoming extremely sharp. Also, using \u2018Stealth\u2019 in the darkness would further improve Ark\u2019s chance of survival.</p><br/><p> Dungeons were environments where Dark Walkers can display 100 percent of their abilities!</p><br/><p> With Gnolls, even if five or six of them flocked together, he had the confidence to win easily.</p><br/><p> \u201cMaster, four dog heads are gathered in front of us.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> Bat, who had left to survey the surroundings, reported its findings.</p><br/><p> \u201cGood, you guys stay here and move when I give the signal. \u2018Stealth!\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p> When Ark used the Dark Walker\u2019s special ability, he was absorbed into the darkness and disappeared. While maintaining this state, Ark walked into the interior of the cave. Just as Bat had reported, about 200 meters ahead, four Gnolls had gathered and were whispering.</p><br/><p> \u201cWe\u2019ve run out of sacrifices. Grrr.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThis is a big problem. God will be angry.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cWe have to storm into the village and catch a human.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cAfter the humans came, God got really angry.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cWill there still be humans in the village?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cEven if we have to go far away, we have to capture some. If we don\u2019t, we might get caught and be eaten.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u2018God? He\u2019ll catch and eat them?\u2019</p><br/><p> He was wondering what they were talking about, but the Gnolls\u2019 conversation ended there.</p><br/><p> \u201cShh, this is strange. For some reason I can smell human.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cHave humans come again? That\u2019s good then\u2026\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> The Gnolls\u2019 eyes gleamed as they looked around.</p><br/><p> Ark went to stand behind one them and sent Bat a signal through telepathy.</p><br/><p> \u2018Pretend to be a human.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p> Since the Familiars were spiritually connected to Ark, communication without words was possible.</p><br/><p> Bat received the signal and dropped pebbles as it flew around. Then the Gnolls flinched and looked away. At that instant, Ark cast Eyes of the Cat and stabbed one in the nape.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> - Critical strike! Backstab effect has increased damage by 200%. The Gnoll will be stunned for 10 seconds.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> Backstab effects were applied when an unexpected surprise attack from behind was dealt! It was an attack often used by Thieves who could use \u2018Stealth\u2019.</p><br/><p> With a single strike, the Gnoll\u2019s health dropped by 50 percent.</p><br/><p> With a rapidfire-like attack, Ark attacked the stunned Gnoll\u2019s weak points. After attacking the weak points exposed by Eyes of the Cat, the Gnoll collapsed without being able to attack properly.</p><br/><p> Once \u2018Stealth\u2019 was lifted, the Gnolls roared savagely.</p><br/><p> \u201cIt\u2019s a Human!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cIt\u2019s a sacrifice! Let\u2019s offer the sacrifice. Grrr!\u201d</p><br/><p> The Gnolls didn\u2019t even notice the death of their comrade.</p><br/><p> They ran forward wildly swinging rusted spears, swords and the like.</p><br/><p> \u201cBat, charge! Skull, Plan B. Support Bat!\u201d</p><br/><p> Following Ark\u2019s commands, Skull and Bat charged towards a Gnoll.</p><br/><p> When Bat violently rammed into the back of the Gnoll\u2019s head, it yelled as it turned around.</p><br/><p> Bat was wise. While maintaining the proper distance from the wildly charging Gnoll, he led it far away from Ark. Bat surrounded the Gnoll with Skull and ravaged it by nipping at it from both sides.</p><br/><p> There were two Gnolls left!</p><br/><p> \u2018If there\u2019s two of them, it\u2019s worth trying!\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p> Ark deflected the swords and thrust himself between the Gnolls.</p><br/><p> The experience he had gained from fighting hundreds of Gnolls became Ark\u2019s strength.</p><br/><p> New World\u2019s graphics was more realistic than reality.</p><br/><p> When the Gnolls swung their spears, their bloodshot eyes as they faced him, the movement of their muscles, and even the swelling of their beating chests with every breath, was perfectly implemented.\u00a0</p><br/><p> If it was a monster he was encountering for the first time, it wouldn\u2019t be easy to predict its movements by little things. The muscle movement was different for each monster.</p><br/><p> But after facing countless battles, with just the movements of a Gnoll\u2019s muscles, he could tell where they were thinking of stabbing.</p><br/><p> Of course, it wasn\u2019t something anyone could do.</p><br/><p> Taekwondo was a martial arts where the outcome of a battle was decided in close proximity with the speed of an instant. If one light step or the movement of a shoulder was missed, a person could be defeated in the blink of an eye. The concentration and keenness of threading the eye of a needle was necessary. Also, you wouldn\u2019t to able to make the deciding blow if you can\u2019t read your opponent\u2019s breathing and strike at the right moment. This was a technique that required a high degree of actual combat experience.</p><br/><p> There were people who said the modern time usage of Taekwondo in actual combat had fallen. But it was a consequence of Taekwondo becoming world-renowned Martials Arts. As it became more renowned, there was more research done on it in order to systematically develop methods for dealing with it.</p><br/><p> By no means had Taekwondo become weaker.</p><br/><p> In the 1970s, throughout North America, Africa, and elsewhere, Taekwondo received praise as the invincible Martial Art. Even the gangs of Harlem showed respect to a Taekwondo Master!</p><br/><p> Ark had been training with Taekwondo for years.</p><br/><p> In addition, Taekwondo had more sparring than other martial arts. It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say he was an expert in reading his opponent\u2019s intentions.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u2018The upper right!\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark tilted his upper body and deflected the spear.</p><br/><p> Simultaneously, a red spot emerged on the Gnoll\u2019s side. The weak points identified by Eyes of the Cat weren\u2019t just for show. In this situation, it was the strongest strike available and it was in a blind spot difficult to defend! The area Ark had predicted coincided with it.</p><br/><p> Before the spots were revealed, Ark\u2019s sword was already piercing through a spot.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> - Critical Strike!</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> While staggering, the Gnoll fell backwards.</p><br/><p> Taking a single step, Ark twisted in the air and threw out a kick.</p><br/><p> It was a habit formed in his movements when he was still unfamiliar with dual-blade combat.</p><br/><p> As he reached intermediate in Dual-Blade Combat, all his movements were slickly connected. But it wasn\u2019t easy. In fact Ark, who had begun his training once more, had lost the kinesthetic sense needed to perform an advanced technique like a mid-air roundhouse kick fluidly.</p><br/><p> In New World one\u2019s stat bonuses were added to their natural strength.</p><br/><p> Here, the bonus of an intermediate level Dual-Blade Combat was applied to the technique\u2019s success rate and power. The sharpness wasn\u2019t comparable to reality.</p><br/><p> With a \u201cchop\u201d sound, he attacked the back of his enemy\u2019s head.</p><br/><p> The Dual-Blade Combat\u2019s effects were similar to Taekwondo\u2019s points system.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> Dual-Blade Combat (Intermediate, Passive 163/300): As the understanding of the technique increases, speed and accuracy will also rise. Grants additional damage to all types of swords and knuckle-related weapons, and dramatically increases evasion and critical hit rate.</p><br/><p> General attack power is increased by 30%. When a shield is equipped, Dual-Blade Combat\u2019s effect disappears.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr><tr><td><br/><p> * Additional Effects. When a kick hits the target, a random status effect occurs, with a probability of 5% for small monsters, 3% for average monsters, and 1% for large monsters. When a very difficult technique is successful, the probability also increases.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> A very difficult attack. So if a techniques like a flying kick or a double kick hits the target, there is a greater probability of an additional effect, such as a knock down or stun, will be inflicted. This effect was not available when he first reached the intermediate level, it was only available after he had gained 150 points, so as he gains more points, probability will also grow.</p><br/><p> The difficulty of a mid-air roundhouse kick was of the highest level!</p><br/><p> The Gnoll received a stun hex and stumbled.</p><br/><p> Ark followed it up with jumping crescent kicks!</p><br/><p> He took turns attacking both sides of the Gnoll while switching kicks. After which, he unsheathed Dark Blade. The Gnoll was defeated by a stream of continuous attacks that were truly like a typhoon as it moaned in vain. Then, the Gnoll behind him thrust its spear towards his back.</p><br/><p> Ark twisted his hips and let the spear fly past his side. When the newly formed stat, flexibility was applied, the damage was reduced. Then his kicks and sword strikes emanated like a storm!</p><br/><p> \u201cGrrrr, this, this Human.........!\u201d</p><br/><p> The Gnoll let out a voice of disbelief, as if he couldn\u2019t believe Ark\u2019s incredible skills.</p><br/><p> Ark was actually a little surprised.</p><br/><p> \u2018My body is light as a feather!\u2019</p><br/><p> Sometimes while training martial arts, one experiences an awakening event.</p><br/><p> There are times when a usual failing technique suddenly succeeds, or a feeling when nerves get extremely sensitive, which allows you to completely see through your opponent\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p> It was Ark\u2019s current state.</p><br/><p> Since starting the game, he had been training his Taekwondo without resting for even a day so he was recovering his sense from the past. With his abilities raised from the darkness within the cave, he was able to exert power even surprising himself!</p><br/><p> *Klock!*</p><br/><p> The Gnoll who was struck in its abdomen by Ark\u2019s side kicks, flew threw several meters in the air and then crashed into the ground. It raised its body while staggering, but at the next blow struck the back of its head and it fell once again.</p><br/><p> When the battle against the two Gnolls first began, it already only had 40 percent of its health left.</p><br/><p> Falling down for the third time, the Gnoll was consumed by fear.</p><br/><p> \u201cStr-Strong!\u201d</p><br/><p> However, Ark got momentarily careless due to his heart-pounding vigor, the Gnoll suddenly blew a whistle.</p><br/><p> \u2018This is bad. Did it call its comrades?\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cBat, Skull! Stop him, make it so he can\u2019t blow that whistle!\u201d</p><br/><p> But before Ark\u2019s finished issuing his command, a sharp sound echoed throughout the cave.</p><br/><p> It was then when the cave began to shake.</p><br/><p> Ark was the first one who smelled something fishy.</p><br/><p> A fishy smell so strong, it paralyzed his sense of smell the moment something poured and writhed from the small holes drilled into the cave like a honeycomb.</p><br/><p> It was hundreds of snakes!</p><br/><p> It was another danger of the cave Galen had warned him about. No matter how good of a swordsman you are, it isn\u2019t an easy task to fight against hundreds of snakes.</p><br/><p> However, Ark only let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p> \u2018Fortunately he wasn\u2019t calling for his comrades. If the opponents are snakes I\u2019ll welcome them.\u2019</p><br/><p> \u201cSpirit of the Cat!\u201d</p><br/><p> Nyaaaa -!</p><br/><p> A sharp cry swept through the inside of the cave.</p><br/><p> At the same time, the illusion of a huge black cat rose above Ark\u2019s head. As its glittering golden eyes slowly opened, the snakes who had been making threatening sounds were left paralyzed.</p><br/><p> The paralysis effect for small monsters!</p><br/><p> The Gnoll screamed, \u201cKyaa, it\u2014 it\u2019s a monster!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cThat isn\u2019t something someone with a dog\u2019s head should say!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark ran forward while treading on the snakes and defeated the Gnoll.</p><br/><p> He then dispatched the stiffened snakes at random.</p><br/><p> \u201cOoh, master. For some reason you look especially strong today.\u201d</p><br/><p> Bat and Skull\u2019s expressions were filled with energy.</p><br/><p> The snakes\u2019 paralysis soon wore off, but he didn\u2019t need to worry.</p><br/><p> Though the paralysis wore off, the effects of Spirit of the Cat lowered small monsters\u2019 attack and defence by 30 percent. On the other hand, the Cat Knight title Ark had received meant he also received a bonus in attack and critical hit rate against small monsters and damage taken from them was reduced.</p><br/><p> It wasn\u2019t an exaggeration to say Ark was invincible when facing small smonters. That was the reason he didn\u2019t care about the snakes when he accepted the quest.</p><br/><p> \u2018Huhuhu, if it\u2019s snakes it doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a hundred or a thousand.\u2019</p><br/><p> Whenever Ark swung his sword, three or four snakes were sliced into pieces.</p><br/><p> On the other hand, the damage he received was just 1. Ark defeated hundreds of snakes as if he was trampling on worms.</p><br/><p> \u2018The quest\u2019s difficulty being C was probably because of these snakes.\u2019</p><br/><p> Truly, if it had been any other user, even if their levels were a lot higher than Ark, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to face such a tough fight with snakes as their opponents. No, they wouldn\u2019t have even dared to enter this cave. But for Ark, who had the title of Cat Knight, snakes and such things didn\u2019t even count as snacks.</p><br/><p> The only thing he had to worry about was the poison that was sometimes inflicted. But since he only lost 50 Health in 30 seconds, it wasn\u2019t a very strong poison. He just needed to make food with detoxification effects through Survival Cooking after the battle ends and eat it, so it wasn\u2019t a problem.</p><br/><p> \u2018This is a smorgasbord of a quest!\u2019</p><br/><p> There were no difficulties for Ark who was full of confidence.</p><br/><p> While he wove his way left and right through the cave, he hunted down and defeated all the Gnolls he set his sight on.</p><br/><p> \u2018This place really is a moneytree!\u2019</p><br/><p> A joyful cry unconsciously burst out of him.</p><br/><p> To Ark, the Gnolls no longer appeared as monsters.</p><br/><p> He saw them as if they were 2,000 won bills or a moving roll of sushi that had come to life.</p><br/><p> Whenever Ark saw a Gnoll, he rushed towards them while drooling.</p><br/><p> \u201cUHUHUHU, MORE, SEND OUT MORE!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cM-Master. Calm down, your eyes look really dangerous.\u201d</p><br/><p> *Clack clack clack.*\u00a0</p><br/><p> Bat and Skull, who had been very excited, were now trembling in fear.</p><br/><p> When the Gnolls were driven into a corner, they had always called on the snakes, but to Ark it was nothing more than a bonus game.</p><br/><p> Ark defeated a hundred Gnolls in just two hours.</p><br/><p> \u201cWith a hundred, I\u2019ve made 20 gold!\u201d</p><br/><p> If possible, he wanted to spend a few days hunting inside the cave.</p><br/><p> However, perhaps because he had received the quest, the Gnolls didn\u2019t regenerate even after he went back to the entrance.</p><br/><p> Well, if he returned after hunting about a thousand of them, Galen, a mountain village store owner, would probably be unable to afford the reward money and go bankrupt.</p><br/><p> In the end, the cave\u2019s Gnolls were almost completely annihilated by the merciless Ark.</p><br/><p> Ark crossed through the deserted cave and headed into its deepest depths.</p><br/><p> A hole with no end in sight gaped at the end of the cave, and at its center, there was a jagged, altar-like protrusion.</p><br/><p> A totem resembling the shape of a snake had been placed on top of the altar.</p><br/><p> As unfortunate as it was, the three Gnolls gathered in that area were the last ones.</p><br/><p> Ark hid his body with \u2018Stealth\u2019 and went closer.</p><br/><p> \u2018Is he the Gnolls\u2019 boss?\u2019</p><br/><p> One unusually dressed Gnoll caught his eye.</p><br/><p> He was draped in a rag-like robe, and atop his head was a crown that appeared to be woven with tree roots. However for a boss-level monster, he didn\u2019t look particularly strong.</p><br/><p> \u2018He\u2019s still a boss. I don\u2019t know what kind of attacks he\u2019ll try.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cGrrr, what the hell happened? Have you still not captured the invading Human?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cTh-that\u2019s\u2026 the bastard is stronger than we thought.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cEven though we let the snakes loose, we weren\u2019t able to kill him.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cGrrr, we won\u2019t be able to appease the God\u2019s fury like this.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> The Boss Gnoll trembled with a frightened expression.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cGod was wounded by the Human who entered awhile ago and is furious. If we allow another human to approach\u2026. Grrr, in any case, we must stop the Human.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cUnderstood.\u201d</p><br/><p> The Gnolls who had received the command lifted their weapons and neared Ark\u2019s location.</p><br/><p> Ark stayed far away and waited for his opportunity.</p><br/><p> When he judged the distance between him and the Boss had widened considerably, he approached at mach speed and attacked one Gnoll with a Backstab.</p><br/><p> The Gnolls were immediately bewildered and the line of battle was disrupted. Once Bat and Skull pitched in, the fight was decided in an instant.</p><br/><p> \u201cHo-how could this be! When did the Human come all the way here\u2026 grrr!\u201d The Boss Gnoll burst out in shock as the Gnoll guards were defeated without a proper fight.</p><br/><p> \u201cCome on, you dog head!\u201d</p><br/><p> Now the only one left was the Boss Gnoll.</p><br/><p> Ark leveled his sword as he prepared for the enemy\u2019s attack.</p><br/><p> But the Boss Gnoll didn\u2019t come to attack Ark.</p><br/><p> Instead, it hastily fled towards the altar, and while shaking the snake-shaped totem he began to recite a strange incantation.</p><br/><p> \u201cNunak, nanak, sandalani! Great King of Snakes!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u2018What the hell is he doing?\u2019</p><br/><p> While perplexed, Ark rushed towards the Boss Gnoll.</p><br/><p> No, the rush was only for an instant.</p><br/><p> The cave suddenly began shaking and something enormous abruptly rose from beneath the cliff. It was a huge monster making a hissing sound as its eyes flashed\u2026 Its identity was a snake with a body width appearing to be several meters wide.</p><br/><p> A warning message popped up in front of him.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> - The boss monster Kundalini has appeared!</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> \u201cGulp! W-What is this?\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark was petrified.</p><br/><p> Ark was no longer a beginner at virtual games.</p><br/><p> Whether he saw a wolf, a rat the size of a bear, or a zombie with its flesh decaying, he didn\u2019t even blink. But the giant snake that appeared before his eyes, Kundalini, was cut from a different cloth than those monsters.</p><br/><p> His felt shivers go down his spine as he faced the hatred mixed with distinctive bloodthirst the snake exuded. Ice-cold sweat poured out of him like a waterfall and flowed down his back.</p><br/><p> The will to fight that buoyed him also cooled.</p><br/><p> \u201cOoooh, my God! King of Snakes! Punish the human!\u201d</p><br/><p> Once Kundalini emerged, the Boss Gnoll let out a cheer. They were the Boss Gnoll\u2019s last words.</p><br/><p> *Snap* *CRUNCH!*</p><br/><p> Kundalini moved with incredible speed and swallowed the Boss Gnoll down.</p><br/><p> Its jaw convulsed as it munched on the crushed Boss Gnoll, and blood gushed out. Kundalini gulped down the Boss Gnoll and raised its head. The several-metered snake raised its head as blood dripped from its mouth in the darkness!</p><br/><p> Rooooar!</p><br/><p> \u2018HOLY SHIT!\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p> A moan unconsciously escaped him.</p><br/><p> The visual impact was enormous.</p><br/><p> Ark felt like he was watching a terrible horror movie.</p><br/><p> Kundalini\u2019s gaze turned towards Ark. They were eyes of a predator staring at him as its prey, not an enemy.</p><br/><p> \u2018Was this the reason why the difficulty was C?\u2019</p><br/><p> He had been severely mistaken. Ark didn\u2019t have to worry about something like a snake. Rather, it was an enormous demon that couldn\u2019t even be called a snake.</p><br/><p> Kundalini slowly glided across the floor, approaching Ark as if there was no need to hurry.</p><br/><p> \u2018Th-the hell is this?\u2019</p><br/><p> Bewilderment escaped Ark\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p> He tried to raise his sword, but his arm wouldn\u2019t move. His legs didn\u2019t budge either, as if they were rooted to the ground.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> - You looked into Kundalini\u2019s eyes, inducing the complete effect of Forestallment.

I\u2019ll be swallowed in one strike, so what kind of damned First Strike is this!\u2019</p><br/><p> To give up the First Strike to a demon who swallowed the Boss Gnoll in one bite, didn\u2019t it mean he was just prey? It really was a bamboozling skill for a bamboozling body.</p><br/><p> Kundalini surreptitiously narrowed the gap as it yawned open its cavernous mouth. Ark couldn\u2019t even move a muscle.</p><br/><p> Just like a frog being captured by a snake, Ark could only stare with dazed eyes at the inside of Kundalini\u2019s crimson mouth. In the instant its mouth was about to touch him, a red light suddenly flashed before him.</p><br/><p> It was Skull.</p><br/><p> At the very moment Kundalini was about to devour Ark whole, Skull rammed Ark.</p><br/><p> *Clack, cla-clack!*</p><br/><p> As Skull clattered, it disappeared into Kundalini\u2019s stomach instead of Ark.</p><br/><p> \u201cSku-Skull!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cWhat are you doing, Master! Get yourself together!\u201d</p><br/><p> As the belated Familiar recall damage registered, he was shocked back into his senses. Once the effect of Forestallment disappeared, the horror that crushed his body disappeared like a dream.</p><br/><p> \u2018That\u2019s right, this is virtual reality. Even a huge snake like this is just EXP was prepared for the sake of the users. There\u2019s no reason why I can\u2019t win. No, I will win!\u2019</p><br/><p> \u201cEyes of the Cat!\u201d</p><br/><p> Kundalini\u2019s information window popped up as he cast the skill.</p><br/><p> When he checked the information, he sucked in his breath. Ark\u2019s level had risen once inside the cave, so it was currently 46. On the other hand, Kundalini was a whopping level 80.</p><br/><p> Even if he included the advantages he had in the dark, there was still a difference of 30 levels. This wasn\u2019t an opponent he could defeat by any regular means.</p><br/><p> However, there was no need give up yet.</p><br/><p> \u2018Kundalini only had 50 percent of its health remaining!\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark immediately saw why.</p><br/><p> There were exceptionally large red weak points marked on Kundalini\u2019s forehead, and in the middle was a single sword was deeply lodged in.</p><br/><p> Numerous thoughts instantaneously combined inside Ark\u2019s head.</p><br/><p> \u2018It\u2019s Lancel! It\u2019s Lancel\u2019s sword!\u2019</p><br/><p> Galen said Lancel had gone to the end of the cave alone. And after several hours, deafening roars had erupted.</p><br/><p> There had also been an hint about Lancel within the Gnolls\u2019 conversation. They\u2019d said an invading Human had inflicted a wound on the God awhile ago which made God sensitive.</p><br/><p> So Lancel had faced Kundalini here, alone.</p><br/><p> Lancel had been defeated without reaching his goal, but with his will, he had protected the village, and its residents were still living and breathing. The sword lodged in Kundalini\u2019s forehead was his will!</p><br/><p> A scene of a Warrior fighting desperately against a huge snake painted itself in front of Ark\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p> \u2018You\u2019re awesome, Lancel!\u2019</p><br/><p> Courage surged in him like an erupting volcano.</p><br/><p> \u2018Alright! I will inherit your goal!\u2019</p><br/><p> Although the monster was level 80, it was a different story when its health was already down to half.</p><br/><p> \u2018It\u2019s ridiculous if I don\u2019t win after all the arrangements have been made for me!\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark swung his sword like lightning and struck a red weak point.</p><br/><p> Ba-ba-ba-baang!\u00a0</p><br/><p> Kundalini staggered with the sounds of impact. But it wasn\u2019t that easy to close the 30 level gap. Even though he\u2019d dealt a critical hit, Kundalini\u2019s Health decreased by just 2 percent.</p><br/><p> Kundalini began its counter attack.</p><br/><p> The thick tail curved like a whip as it flew forward.</p><br/><p> When he rolled on the ground and avoided it, the cave walls were hit so it began to crack and shake.</p><br/><p> It had power so outrageous, it wouldn\u2019t even allow him to block!</p><br/><p> \u2018I\u2019ll have to put my all into avoiding its attack!\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cBat, attract its attention.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cDammit, you always give me the hard jobs!\u201d</p><br/><p> Bat wailed its complaint as it hung in front of Kundalini\u2019s nose.</p><br/><p> The accuracy of Kundalini\u2019s attacks dropped. It had no time to properly concentrate on Ark, so it randomly swung its tail.</p><br/><p> Ark waited until the tail was right in front of his nose, then rolled on the ground and stabbed it with his sword. He didn\u2019t have the luxury of aiming for something like a critical hit.</p><br/><p> Although he wasn\u2019t dealing much damage to it now, it was all he could do to steadily chip off its Health.</p><br/><p> Once he made up his mind and evaded, Kundalini\u2019s attacks were slower than expected. The sword wedged in its forehead was probably also influencing Kundalini\u2019s stats. However, even Ark couldn\u2019t avoid all the attacks.</p><br/><p> KA-POW--!\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cUgh!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark was pushed back several meters.</p><br/><p> From just one slam of the tail, he lost 400 Health and he was poisoned. Almost only half of his Health remained.</p><br/><p> In other words, it would be game over if he took just one more attack. Moreover, he had only touched the tail, yet he was poisoned and his Health was being steadily eaten away. With an attack of this level, it would be no use even if he was to drink a potion.</p><br/><p> If he took an attack while drinking four recovery potions, which cost 100 Gold each, he would incur a loss instead.</p><br/><p> \u2018No matter how slowed Kundalini\u2019s movements are, considering the level difference, I can\u2019t avoid it forever. I can\u2019t help but be hit by one attack every five. And the poison is stronger than regular snakes by 3 or 4 times. The battle will get worse the longer it goes on! Some kind of decisive strike...\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark\u2019s eyes turned towards the sword wedged in its forehead.</p><br/><p> A bigger red point than any other!</p><br/><p> That was likely Kundalini\u2019s decisive weakness!</p><br/><p> \u2018I have no choice, I\u2019ll have to risk it!\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p> Ark made up his mind and quickly commanded, \u201cBat, attract its attention upwards!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cGot it, Master! Up here, you big worm body!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> Bat flew rapidly in front of Kundalini\u2019s eyes and soared up. The moment Kundalini\u2019s attention turned upward, Ark flung forward and clambered onto its back.</p><br/><p> The snake was several meters wide.</p><br/><p> Ark ran up Kundalini\u2019s back while displaying the sense of balance honed by Taekwondo. When he climbed up to its neck, Kundalini sensed Ark\u2019s intention and fiercely raised its neck.</p><br/><p> As the slope became vertical, Ark slid down.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cNo way!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark flung himself forward and stabbed his sword into its jaw.</p><br/><p> Kundalini lowered its neck again and a heavy noise of impact burst out. At that moment, Ark crawled up Kundalini\u2019s neck and stood on its head. Then he put all his strength in one strike towards the forehead.</p><br/><p> \u201cDark Blade!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><div></div><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> - You do not have enough Mana!</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> \u201cDammit it!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark screamed at the unimaginable pop up message.</p><br/><p> The chronic dilemma that had plagued him, lack of Mana, reared its ugly head in the most decisive moment.</p><br/><p> Ark had only used Eyes of the Cat once at the start of the battle. But grating away Kundalini\u2019s Health had consumed too much time. Because he had steadily used up Mana while sustaining Bat\u2019s summon. He only had 80 Mana left.</p><br/><p> It had been 7 minutes since the start of his fight with Kundalini. The Mana he\u2019d used was 420.</p><br/><p> If Skull hadn\u2019t been forcefully recalled earlier, Bat would have already returned to the Netherworld. Ark had forgotten about this fact because he\u2019d never fought this long with them before.</p><br/><p> 'Stupid! How could I have not checked the amount of Mana I had left!'</p><br/><p> It was an absurd mistake.</p><br/><p> ROOOAAR!</p><br/><p> While Ark exploded in embarrassment, Kundalini began to glow.</p><br/><p> Ark groaned as he clutched the sword stuck in the writhing Kundalini\u2019s forehead.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u2018Damn, is it really going to end like this?\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p> Bat would return to the Netherworld in 80 seconds.</p><br/><p> He couldn\u2019t use his deadly Dark Blade, either.</p><br/><p> Kundalini\u2019s remaining Health was 30 percent. A win wasn\u2019t guaranteed even if he used Dark Blade three or four times, but he couldn\u2019t even use it once! Even if attacked it with at least a dozen normal critical hits, the remaining Health wouldn\u2019t be depleted.</p><br/><p> Of course, Kundalini wouldn\u2019t just let itself be hit, either.</p><br/><p> A way to win didn\u2019t emerge no matter what. It would be game over if he let go of the sword he was holding onto. Even if he wasn\u2019t eaten by Kundalini, he would die instantly if he fell into the chasm with no bottom in sight that yawned underneath him.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, an idea flashed across Ark's mind.</p><br/><p> \u2018That\u2019s right, I may not be able to win, but there\u2019s a way to die together!\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark opted for this final idea.</p><br/><p> Fortunately, before he left Lancel village, he had set it to be his resurrection place. Then even if he died here, he didn\u2019t have to worry about returning to Jackson. Dying together with Kundalini was one method.</p><br/><p> If he hurried and returned to the cave, he could still get the Kundalini\u2019s dropped loot. Since he could complete the quest on top of that, it was worth penalty.</p><br/><p> \u2018That\u2019s the most I can do right now!\u2019</p><br/><p> The problem was\u00a0<em>how</em>\u00a0they could die together.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cBat, lure it towards the chasm!\u201d Ark shouted as he hung from Kundalini\u2019s head.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \"Understood, Master. Hey you!\"</p><br/><p> GRAAAWR!\u00a0</p><br/><p> Bat stabbed Kundalini\u2019s eye and fled towards the chasm.</p><br/><p> Ark clutched onto the sword hilt and was wrenched around; when Kundalini arrived at the edge, he stabbed the forehead with his sword with all his strength.</p><br/><p> As he landed a critical hit, Kundalini grated its body against the wall. He was wedged between the wall and Kundalini\u2019s body, so his Health dropped steadily. But Ark didn\u2019t stop and stabbed his sword two, three times in succession.</p><br/><p> His tenacity called forth a miracle.</p><br/><p> Having writhed against the wall, Kundalini couldn't balance its weight and slid towards the cliff. The bottomless pit gaped underneath it.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cI did it!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> Ark clenched his eyes shut.</p><br/><p> He experienced a peculiar sense of floating.</p><br/><p> A few seconds, or perhaps minutes flowed past. Then Kundalini crashed into the ground and he felt an enormous shock. Kundalini, who had received a huge amount of damage from falling, had its Health sucked out, leaving only 3 percent.</p><br/><p> \u2018What? How am I still alive?\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p> Ark was stunned.</p><br/><p> Even Kundalini\u2019s incredible Health had been decreased by over 20 percent. Then Ark, who only had about 300 of his Health left, should have died instantly. However, Ark was still alive.</p><br/><p> He had just 20 Health left, but he wasn\u2019t dead.</p><br/><p> Just then, a message window popped up before Ark\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> Due to Cat Knight's ability, falling damage has been reduced by 50 percent.

An ability that he hadn\u2019t cared about until now had activated in a desperately dangerous moment.\u00a0</p><br/><p> Also, thanks to the Taekwondo he had trained every single day since starting the game, he had automatically attempted to roll in the moment of impact.</p><br/><p> As a result, Ark slid past 80 percent of damage and survived.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u2018I don\u2019t have time to waste. The poison wasn\u2019t cured, so my Health is still dropping.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark sprang up.</p><br/><p> Perhaps it was because of the falling damage, but his body didn\u2019t move properly. However, Kundalini, who had received 100 percent of the falling damage, hadn\u2019t even gathered its senses yet.</p><br/><p> Kundalini was stretched out panting as its body glowed red.\u00a0</p><br/><p> Double critical chance!</p><br/><p> \u201cDie!\u201d</p><br/><p> With Bat, Ark plunged his sword toward Kundalini\u2019s forehead.

After making an urgent antidote, he made food that recovered Health. His Health had dropped to the bottom, so he finally recovered after making and eating food three, four times.</p><br/><p> The sword that had been lodged in its forehead and a skull had fallen where Kundalini had disappeared.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> Lancel\u2019s Sword (Cursed)</p><br/><p> This is the sword used by Lancel, the leader of Lancel Village.

But it was harder to use than an unidentified item. An unidentified item could be checked after paying a certain amount of money to a user in a big city, but lifting a curse was only possible at a cathedral in the capital city of Schudenberg Kingdom.</p><br/><p> That meant it was an item that he couldn\u2019t even use until he arrived in the capital. Moreover, it supposedly took a considerable amount of money to lift a curse.</p><br/><p> If he lifted the curse and it turned out to be nothing much, his loss would be extreme. But Ark soon shook his head.</p><br/><p> \u2018No. It\u2019s still a sword that had cut up to 50 percent of the Health of a strong monster like Kundalini. It might actually be an incredible sword. But is there any other item?\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark packed the sword and Lancel\u2019s Remains and looked around.</p><br/><p> However, he didn\u2019t see an item no matter how much he looked. Instead, he discovered a pathway leading upwards and climbed back to the place where the Boss Gnoll had been. He was able to start leaving the cave when he saw a dim light suddenly flowing from one side.</p><br/><p> It was the altar that the Boss Gnoll had prayed at when calling forth Kundalini.</p><br/><p> When Ark approached and touched it, a new window popped up.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> You have discovered an ancient artifact, the Altar of Incubation.</p><br/><p> Through Knowledge of Ancient Artifacts, you have discovered hidden information about the Altar of Incubation.

But a thought that suddenly surfaced made him stop in his tracks.</p><br/><p> \u2018Wait? It\u2019ll accelerate the incubation of any egg?\u2019</p><br/><p> If so, it might be surprisingly useful.</p><br/><p> Ark did have one egg. Just in case, Ark summoned the young Netherworld\u2019s Egg. Then he placed it on top of the altar, but there was no change.</p><br/><p> Ark tilted his head, placed his pot on the altar, and made food just in case.

In addition, because it is tied to you by familial love, it will not consume Mana even if a battle breaks out.</p><br/><p> Race: Creature of the Netherworld</p><br/><p> Alignment: Dark</p><br/><p> Class: \u2014\u00a0</p><br/><p> Health: 50</p><br/><p> Loyalty: \u2014\u00a0</p><br/><p> Strenght: \u2014\u00a0</p><br/><p> Agility: \u2014\u00a0</p><br/><p> Stamina: \u2014\u00a0</p><br/><p> Wisdom: \u2014\u00a0</p><br/><p> Intelligence: \u2014\u00a0</p><br/><p> Luck: \u2014</p><br/><p> * It can store the same number of items as the summoner with no weight limit.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> He had struggled like crazy and had finally hatched it, but it didn\u2019t have a single stat. That meant he couldn\u2019t use it in battle.</p><br/><p> However, its special ability intrigued Ark.</p><br/><p> 'It can store items?'</p><br/><p> Ark stared at the snake, which was charmingly clambering onto his arm.</p><br/><p> Just in case, he tried holding out Lancel's Sword a bit. The snake stared at it blankly, then suddenly shot out its tongue like a frog catching a fly and swallowed it.</p><br/><p> 'Huh? Did it really eat it?'</p><br/><p> Ark stared at the snake with a perplexed expression.</p><br/><p> \"Spit it back out!\"\u00a0</p><br/><p> When Ark shouted in a bewildered voice, the snake opened its mouth again and spat out the sword onto Ark\u2019s hand. Then it blinked its bright eyes and rubbed its head into him as if it were asking for praise.</p><br/><p> A laugh escaped Ark\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p> \"Ha, what the hell is this?\"</p><br/><p> Should he call it fascinating, or funny?</p><br/><p> He felt an indescribable feeling. He no longer felt his initial disappointment, because he had desperately needed a spare bag. Moreover, there was no burden if it didn\u2019t eat Mana during battle like his other Familiars did.</p><br/><p> It was something he learned too late, but a Dark Walker had a smaller bag capacity in comparison to other professions. Merchants and production classes were provided 6 basic bags. Magic professions had a basic bag and 3 spare bags with half the capacity. Even Warriors had one spare bag in addition to their basic bag.</p><br/><p> But Ark\u2019s bag capacity had only expanded slightly with his job-change. After packing in all kinds of food ingredients, he\u2019d found that he always lacked bag capacity.</p><br/><p> Of course, there were ways to increase bag capacity. But the magic bag sold in large cities was a whopping 200 gold for only a quarter of the basic bag\u2019s capacity! Ark had given up early after hearing about the outrageous price.</p><br/><p> \u2018Since it can store the same capacity as a basic bag, it means I\u2019ve earned 800 gold. Is this little guy the reason why a Dark Walker isn\u2019t provided an additional bag?\u2019</p><br/><p> \u201cAlright, from now on I\u2019ll comfortably call you \u2018Snake.\u2019\u201d</p><br/><p> Snake nodded as if it had heard. Then it excitedly rubbed itself on him repeatedly and wrapped itself around Ark\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p> It looked like a belt made out of snake skin.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou\u2019re a really likable fella. I\u2019m satisfied with this much.\u201d</p><br/><p> Now he had finished everything he had to do in the cave.</p><br/><p> Ark headed back to the village of Lancel.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><br/><p>* * *</p><br/><p> \u201cYou really did it!\u201d The store owner exclaimed once Ark spread out the Gnoll leathers.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cThis is the promised compensation. 20 silvers per leather. It\u2019s a total of 21 gold. And this is the reward for saving the village.\u201d</p><br/><p> Galen gave him a total of 31 gold as a reward.</p><br/><p> After completing the quest, his intimacy with Galen had risen considerably as a bonus. He was able to sell the japtem he had acquired within the cave for an additional 10 percent. Ark roughly finished tidying up and returned Lancel\u2019s Remains as he spoke of Kundalini.</p><br/><p> Galen was surprised, but he soon nodded with understanding.</p><br/><p> \u201cSo a demon like that lived in the cave. Lancel was a Mercenary stronger than anyone I know. I didn\u2019t believe that such a person could been killed by just Gnolls.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes, if it weren\u2019t for the wound on Kundalini that Lancel inflicted, I would have never been able to win. But who exactly is Lancel? If he was able to enter the cave alone and face that demon, which indicates that his skill wasn\u2019t common...\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark asked because he thought he might be able to learn more about Lancel\u2019s Sword.</p><br/><p> Galen hesitated with a dark expression and spoke, \u201cYou\u2019re right, Lancel was no ordinary Mercenary. Once, he was so violent a Mercenary that they called him \u2018Vampire\u2019 in a border war. Over a hundred Soldiers died at his hands. But that was against Lancel\u2019s will. It\u2019s just that the battlefield and the sword made him go crazy. Eventually, Lancel regained his senses, realized the disillusionment of his actions, and left the battlefield. Then, with the determination to be a help to someone, he led the pioneers and decided to set up this village.</p><br/><p> \u201cSo even as he fought a dreadful demon, he couldn\u2019t give up on the village.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cThat\u2019s right, he really was atoning, in a way.\u201d</p><br/><p> Galen let out a sigh.</p><br/><p> \u201cNo matter his past, I admired him. I also love the village he set up. Now that the danger has disappeared thanks to you, I\u2019m of a mind to rebuild this village even if I have to devote my whole life to it. Speaking of which\u2026 are you thinking of continuing your journey?\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Yes, of course.\"</p><br/><p> \u201cThen, will you listen to my request?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cPlease tell me.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cThe pioneers who followed Lancel all love this village. The only reason why they left was because they worried about their family\u2019s safety. But now the danger is gone. If you happen to meet them in your journey, please let them know of this fact. If it\u2019s them, they will definitely return. Of course, it\u2019s good if you find and send new villagers, too. This village is open to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI understand. I will speak of the person named Lancel to people I meet in my journey around the world. I will tell them how honorable and amiable a place this village is.\u201d</p><br/><p> When Ark nodded, the quest was updated.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> Quest has been updated.</p><br/><p> Pioneer Village Lancel\u2019s Misfortune = Find New Settlers!</p><br/><p> Lancel\u2019s general store owner, Galen, wants to continue Lancel\u2019s wish and rebuild the village.</p><br/><p> What Lancel Village needs most right now are residents. Many people must gather and the laughter of children must fill the air for Lancel to be reborn as a true village.</p><br/><p> Galen has requested that you find residents for Lancel, like the pioneers who shared Lancel\u2019s goal in the past and even people who have nowhere else to go. Galen has accepted Lancel\u2019s wish to become helpful in the world and has promised to openly accept all residents. If you guide them to this place, Lancel Village will definitely become the village that Lancel desired.</p><br/><p> Finding new settlers: achieved 0%</p><br/><p> Difficulty: C</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> There wasn\u2019t any information about how to solve the quest. But after receiving the quest first, there would be a hint somewhere.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou should hold onto Lancel\u2019s Sword. I know Lancel would also want that.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> Of course, Ark had no intention of giving it up even if he was asked to.</p><br/><p> Anyways, Ark left Lancel after those words.</p><br/><p> The very first thing he did after leaving Lancel was to summon Skull.\u00a0</p><br/><p> *Clack clack clack*\u00a0</p><br/><p> When he saw Skull clacking its teeth as if there was nothing wrong, tears blurred Ark\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p> Although it was revived again, Skull had thrown away its life for his sake. In a sense, it was an action that was harder for an NPC that actually died than it was for a player. But Skull had sacrificed itself without hesitation. In addition, Bat had done its best to help Ark.</p><br/><p> When he looked at these Familiars, affection surged forth anew.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u2018Such praiseworthy little rascals.\u2019\u00a0</p><br/><p> Snake, the new addition to his family, was definitely lovable. Perhaps because Snake truly thought of him as its parent, but it put its all into rubbing Ark affectionately whenever it could.</p><br/><p> \u2018That\u2019s right, these guys are all I have. Sink or swim, I\u2019ll go together with these fellas.\u2019</p><br/><p> It wasn\u2019t just that his sense of unity was strengthened; there was also an actual benefit. He no longer had to give up items because of bag space. Now that he could store double the items thanks to Snake, Ark became even greedier.</p><br/><p> 'Now that the family has increased, I have to earn more, even if it's just 1 Copper.'</p><br/><p> Ark scraped in all the japtem and ingredients he could get his hands on as he followed the Hand Mirror\u2019s light. Because of that, his pace slowed even more, and he crossed the Argus Mountains after a week.</p><br/><p> There were still unexplored regions on the other side of the Argus Mountains.</p><br/><p> Even when he walked for several days, he couldn\u2019t find any players, let alone NPCs.</p><br/><p> After passing a plain where he could see the horizon and floods a few times and hunting the monsters he encountered in those places, he reached level 50. When his two bags were nearly chock full of japtem, Ark was able to arrive at his destination.</p><br/><p> \u2018It\u2019s the lighthouse!\u2019</p><br/><p> On one side of the beach stood a picturesque, scenic lighthouse.</p><br/><p> It was the lighthouse he\u2019d seen through the Hand Mirror; he had finally reached his destination after a very long journey.</p><br/><p> When he had seen it through images, it was a place that had only looked beautiful. But when he actually arrived and looked, the area around the lighthouse was crawling with monsters he had never seen before.</p><br/><p> They were monsters with shark-like appearances equipped with both arms and legs. When he checked the information with Eyes of the Cat, he found they were called Sharkmen. They were level 55, but they were a little stronger than monsters of the same level.</p><br/><p> \u2018Well, I\u2019ll manage to fight them somehow, but it\u2019s hard to face more than one of them. It\u2019ll be good to wait until night for now.\u2019</p><br/><p> At night, all his stats increased by 20 percent.</p><br/><p> To fight in the dark. It was one of the Dark Walker's basic tactics.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

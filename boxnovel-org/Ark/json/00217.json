This is the game exclusive news.\u201d</p><br/><p>A reporter smiled and began to talk in a studio showing the logo of the game exclusive news.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has been 3 years since New World swept the online games and it currently has 10 million users playing. But this feature is different from our previous ones. What is different?\u201d</p><br/><p>The female broadcaster smiled at the host\u2019s question and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday we have Ark, who is the best celebrity of New World in the studio.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u00a0 Ark-nim? The legendary player Ark who resurrected thousands of users and defeated the Dark Lord half a year ago? Moreover, he is the president of the complex business Ark\u2019s Corporation and is the first user to become a Duke in the Schudenberg Kingdom.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOmo, you know quite a bit about him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m just Ark\u2019s fan.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host smiled and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Ark is known for not really appearing in the media.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is something worth celebrating.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething worth celebrating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to it yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female broadcaster smiled as a young man entered the studio. The young man dressed in jeans and an old t-shirt was none other than Hyun-woo.</p><br/><p>\u201cWelcome Ark-nim!\u201d</p><br/><p>The host instantly greeted Hyun-woo as he entered. Then he hurled questions as soon as Hyun-woo sat.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re much younger than I thought so can I ask for your age?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m turning 25 this year.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s so young. But could you tell us what you have to celebrate?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s see. A few days ago, Global Exos gave me a position as an advisor in the company.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAn advisor? At twenty-five years old?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGlobal Exos told me that it is unprecedented to appoint someone so young to that position.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyun-woo scratched his head with an embarrassed expression. The host looked him in the eye and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is really amazing that you were selected. Can I ask you the secret?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe secret\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, the process by which Hyun-woo became the advisor was very complicated. Two months ago, Hyun-woo had swallowed Lucifer\u2019s Immortality Pill. He thought it would give him ridiculous stats but the immortality pill ended up giving Ark the master code.</p><br/><p>Yuna had hidden the master code inside Project: Lucifer. It was the trick of hiding the treasure inside the enemy camp! However, Park Woo-seong who knew the location of the master code had fallen into a coma so Global Exos was unable to find it. Then Hyun-woo ended up eating it. Global Exos later became aware of it and used all types of methods to regain the master code. However, the master code had already been digested by Ark. There was no method of separating the master code from Ark.</p><br/><p>However, they couldn\u2019t just release someone with the ability of the Creator into New World. Therefore Global Exos had given Ark the official position of \u2018Manager.\u2019\u00a0Hyun-woo recalled that time and laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just put all my efforts into New World. Global Exos appreciated it and decided to thank me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha, isn\u2019t that a coy answer?\u00a0Are you afraid that others could reach that position?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyun-woo gave an easy going smile and answered.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou seem disappointed so I apologize.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot at all. If you don\u2019t mind this impolite question, won\u2019t you receive quite a lot of money know that Ark\u2019s Corporation is so successful and you are the advisor of Global Exos? I don\u2019t understand everything but it seems enough to call you a game tycoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite a lot of people seem to think this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre we wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt depends on the definition of a game tycoon.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you deliberating avoiding the answer?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou deliberately gave me a question that is difficult to answer.\u201d</p><br/><p>The host laughed at Hyun-woo\u2019s answer.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen I\u2019m going to cut to the chase. You\u2019ve gained a lot of wealth and fame after the Demonic War both in the game and reality. And many viewers are still interested in your videos. That\u2019s why we wanted to meet Ark-nim. Ark-nim was the commander of thousands of troops and you also defeated the Dark Lord and the Red Man.\u201d</p><br/><p>The studio started playing the video of the Kwarian battle on the large screen. The host didn\u2019t ask Hyun-woo any questions while playing the video.\u00a0After 1 hour\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Hyun-woo looked at the clock and became surprised.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh I\u2019m sorry. We\u2019ll have to finish this here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u00a0 What\u2026..?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere is another important event today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hyun-woo rose and began to leave the studio.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a minute. Just one more word. What does Ark-nim think is the secret to your success?\u201d</p><br/><p>The confused host hurriedly asked. Hyun-woo stopped and replied.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrinding.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cG-grinding?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo matter how times change, grinding is one thing that doesn\u2019t change in online games.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-</p><div></div><br/><p>\u201cHurry Burning Soul!\u201d</p><br/><p>Kurarara, kurarara!</p><br/><p>Ark raced over the seas on Burning Soul. He appeared at an island after flying for a while. It was Seutandal that was previously known as the Netherworld. Ark flew across the coast and headed towards Haman Fortress. But something was different about Haman Fortress. The flags of every kingdom were hung and there were a large number of flowers all over the place.\u00a0Today an unprecedented event was occurring at Haman Fortress.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a little late. Damn, that guy will become grumpy\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He landed in a square in Haman Fortress. Then a group of people stampeded towards him.</p><br/><p>\u201cArk, you only arrived now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt has already started.\u201d</p><br/><p>The men were the rehabilitation members.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t you know you\u2019re the last one to arrive?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs everyone else already here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, they arrived a while ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is JusticeMan ajusshi and my mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be ridiculous.\u00a0 You know what they\u2019re like now that they\u2019re getting married soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jjak-tung frowned and pointed to one side. The pair of them were stuck together without caring about the gazes of other people\u2026.. They were JusticeMan and So-mi.</p><br/><p>After the Demonic War ended, JusticeMan finally managed to successfully propose to So-mi. And their wedding was occurring in one month. Therefore JusticeMan and So-mi weren\u2019t afraid to show their affection everywhere.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn, do we have to grow old as bachelors?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to find a lover quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bul-kkun pouted and grumbled. Then someone muttered from behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think it is impossible with your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the? What scum\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bul-kkun turned around and was about to shout when he flinched and closed his mouth. The man standing behind him raised an eyebrow and asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is me. What will you do?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh no, you\u2019re Isyuram hyung-nim? Hehehe, have you been living well these days?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s creepy. Don\u2019t touch me.\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. The one who caused Bul-kkun to cringe was Isyuram. Isyuram had played an important role in stopping Maseutyu from restoring the shield so he had received quite a lot of achievement points.\u00a0However, that wasn\u2019t the only thing Isyuram obtained from the Demonic War. Ark had all the data of New World thanks to the master code so he obtained the information of the criminal organization for Isyuram. Thanks to that achievement, Isyuram became the team leader of a special cyber investigation squad. Isyuram had to live in the stuffy game unit again but he didn\u2019t hate New World despite his complaints.</p><br/><p>\u201cTeacher-nim, have you been well?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, I know you\u2019re busy but you should come to the gym sometimes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isyuram said before heading into Haman Fortress. Bul-kkun breathed a sigh of relief when Isyuram suddenly shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeez, it is almost finished. Let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ark and the rehabilitation members hurriedly ran into the fortress. There were familiar faces inside.</p><br/><p>Sid holding a large backpack (Sid was currently the chief of Seutandal\u2019s branch of the merchant\u2019s guild), Buksil, Sapjil and Ulmeok running around drooling at the food (the three pig brothers were the Seutandal branch chief of Ark\u2019s store), Bread and Redian (both of them were now officially in a relationship) and Wormer who was already dozing off (after the Demonic War, Wormer was the chief of the Magic Institute\u2019s engineering division).</p><br/><p>Aside from the NPCs, Haman Fortress was also full of NPCs.\u00a0The reason they were all gathered today\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cLook over there. Kikiki, that guy who is always so smug is frozen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear? That guy drank alcohol and cried when he proposed.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe also gave up his profession as an assassin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rehabilitation members laughed and pointed towards someone standing in front while people lined up on both sides. They were a man and woman wearing formal clothes.\u00a0They were Shambala and Isabel.\u00a0That\u2019s right. Today Shambala\u2019s long-time dream had become a reality. For the first time in the history of online games, a user was marrying a NPC. It was Shambala and Isabel\u2019s wedding. Apart from the NPCs and users, there were many reporters present.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy, he really is marrying an NPC.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had heard about the wedding for a while but actually seeing it was strange. But what was the difference? They were just like people. Wasn\u2019t this New World where anything was possible?\u00a0Jjak-tung nudged Ark\u2019s side and smirked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, when are you going to get married?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u00a0 I\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Ark scratched his head and blushed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow the bride Isabel is going to throw her bouquet.</p><br/><p>Isabel laughed brightly and threw her bouquet high into the sky. Then two women suddenly jumped out from the crowd. The two throwing their bodies was Roco and Lariette! The guests burst out laughing.</p><br/><p>That was\u2026\u2026 Anyway, Ark\u2019s worries would definitely continue.</p><br/><p>THE END\u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Something was wrong with my head when I suddenly rose to success after spending my earlier days so deprived. If you would just give me one more chance...\u201d</p><br/><p> \"And to whom do you owe your success to?\"</p><br/><p> \u201cOf course, it\u2019s thanks to Master. I was impudent without knowing your grace.\u201d</p><br/><p> Dedric shed large drops of tears.</p><br/><p> \u2018Look at the rascal.\u2019 Ark laughed to himself.</p><br/><p> Ark had lived while unwillingly receiving affected sympathy from many people. Thanks to that, he gained an unwelcome ability; by simply looking at the other person\u2019s eyes, he could tell if the words coming from their mouth were sincere or not.</p><br/><p> Dedric\u2019s words were not sincere.</p><br/><p> He was just an NPC, but he knew how to cunningly trick someone.</p><br/><p> 'It seems I shouldn't have thoughtlessly evolved him.'</p><br/><p> Bat also had a bad personality, but he wasn\u2019t cunning. After evolving into Dedric, he learned how to be crafty. It meant ego also increases with each evolution. He wasn\u2019t sincere, but it seemed Dedric had yielded this time. However, there was no guarantee it would be this easy if it happens again.</p><br/><p> Skull was the same. Though it was a faithful Familiar now, there was no way of telling how it would change when it evolved.\u00a0</p><br/><p> 'Summons are also intelligent beings.'</p><br/><p> This incident changed how Ark viewed his Familiars.</p><br/><p> Each Familiar had a different personality. Even so, Ark tried to treat the Familiars equally. He didn\u2019t favor one and neglect the others. That was the problem.</p><br/><p> \u2018Seems like I have to use control; the carrot and stick approach.\u201d</p><br/><p> Just as there are fellows who do better if you praise them, there are those who get cocky. In addition, there are those who perform properly only with the use of violence and threats.</p><br/><p> Granted, even a good medicine can be counterproductive if overdosed, he would need to regulate it.</p><br/><p> This was why Ark had beaten Dedric to the point where it seemed overboard. Even the highly loyal Skull or Snake might change personalities one day. To prepare for that day, he set an example with Dedric. In other words, Dedric had been severely punished because he was unfortunately chosen to set an example.</p><br/><p> 'Whew, it isn't easy taking care of 3 Familiars. I think I can finally understand how hard it is for teachers who have to teach dozens.'</p><br/><p> \u201cAlright, since you contributed, I\u2019ll forgive you this time as promised.\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Ahh! Thank you, Master.\"</p><br/><p> \"Repeat after me, vow one!\"\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cWhat?\u201d Dedric tilted his head but quickly raised his hand when Ark pierced him with a glare.</p><br/><p> \"Vow one!\"\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cI will always obey Master no matter the situation. I will always serve him with a smiling face, fight when told to fight, and die when told to die. My life and death only belong to Master.\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Vow two!\"</p><br/><p> \u201cI will gratefully accept and eat the food given by Master. Also, I will never complain.\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Vow three!\"</p><br/><p> \u201cIf I cannot follow the previous two vows, I will soundly receive some form of punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p> Dedric\u2019s face paled at the continuing Familiar doctrine.</p><br/><p> \u201cYou\u2019ve memorized it all, right?\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Yes...\"\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cGood, then return to the Netherworld and stay there and write an apology letter until I call you again.\"</p><br/><p> Dedric returned to the Netherworld looking as if he\u2019d stepped in poop.</p><br/><p> With this, the coup d\u2019etat that started with the evolution was hopelessly suppressed. In addition, he even formed a slave contract.</p><br/><p> The Child Protection Agency or the Animal Welfare Organization would be appalled if they knew about this. But this was a game, and Ark was truly a dictator.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><br/><p>* * *</p><br/><p> Not far from the shore where the dolphins dropped him off, Ark saw a village. It was a bustling village, with quite a lot of users coming in and out. Snake wasn\u2019t a problem since it was disguised as a belt as usual, but Skull or Bat would attract a lot of attention from the users, so they were no good. After sending the Familiars back, Ark walked towards the village.</p><br/><p> \u2018Huhuhu, how long has it been?\u2019 As he headed to the village, Ark had a delighted smile on his face.</p><br/><p> The store in Nodeless didn\u2019t purchase the items he\u2019d obtained in the ocean. Thanks to that, his bag and, of course, Snake, were chock full of items from the ocean. Since his Magic Restoration reached Intermediate, all the items had 100% durability. Still, though they were rare, they were still japtem. They couldn\u2019t be sold for a lot of money.</p><br/><p> There was something else that made Ark feel good. It was the bag of pearls he earned in Nodelesse. He had earned a colossal amount of at least 800 pearls from item sales, his food stall, and repairs. Although it was a low-class jewel compared it others, it was still a jewel. So, how could he not be happy!?</p><br/><p> After entering the village, Ark immediately sought out the General Store.</p><br/><p> \u201cWelcome! What can I do for you?\u201d A pleasant-faced store owner greeted Ark.</p><br/><p> \"I wish to sell all these things. How much would you give me?\"</p><br/><p> As Ark took out the mountainous pile of japtem, the owner\u2019s mouth opened wide. There was leather from all sorts of marines monsters, coral, and underwater equipment. Even though they were japtem, they were items hard to see on land.</p><br/><p> The store owner calculated the prices one by one and proposed an amount. \u201cFor all of it, it\u2019s 34 Gold. You won\u2019t find a better price anywhere else nearby.\u201d</p><br/><p> The market value wasn't bad.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u2018If it\u2019s this much, I won\u2019t make a loss even if I sell the pearls.\u2019 Ark nodded as he held out the pearls. \u201cHow much can you give me for this?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cOhh, these are pretty good quality pearls, and there\u2019s 800 of them... Where did you get them from?\u201d</p><br/><p> \"I can't give you the specifics.\"\u00a0</p><br/><p> \"Well, there\u2019s no need for me to know.\"\u00a0</p><br/><p> The store owner carefully inspected the pearls and flicked the beads on an abacus.</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019ll pay 25 Silver a piece. So in total, it\u2019ll be 200 Gold.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> A look of slight disappointment spread across Ark\u2019s face. He had expected 300 Gold; it was 100 Gold short.</p><br/><p> \u2018Should I just go to Harun or Jackson to sell them?'</p><br/><p> If he were to go back to Harun or Jackson, where he had high Intimacy, he could get the expected 300 Gold, but it would take a full week to return to Jackson. The monsters he would encounter while going were only level 40, so a round trip meant he had to give up on a fortnight\u2019s worth of EXP.</p><br/><p> 100 Gold or a fortnight of experience. There was no contest.</p><br/><p> \u2018I\u2019ll have to go sometime because of the \u2018Envoy of the Merpeople\u2019 quest, but I don\u2019t have time to do that right now. Since I\u2019ve come this far, I have to at least visit a few cities. It\u2019s regretful, but it\u2019s better to just sell them.\u2019</p><br/><p> \"Ah!\"</p><br/><p> At that moment, a user looking at goods in the shop saw Ark and made a shocked expression. Then, with a somewhat angered voice, he pulled Ark by the arm and said, \u201cHow could you sell the items without even consulting me? Even if you do sell, you have to sell it after settling the problem of distribution first. Mister, we\u2019ll return a little later.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>[T/N: The other user is pretending Ark is his party member, which is why he\u2019s offended Ark would try to sell the items without figuring out who gets what first.]</em></p><br/><p> \"You do that.\"</p><br/><p> Ark who was dragged out without being able to say anything, freed his arm.</p><br/><p> \"Who are you? I think you have the wrong person.\"</p><br/><p> \u201cAh, I\u2019m sorry. You were surprised because I suddenly butted in, huh?\u201d</p><br/><p> The man was a Hobbit. He was short and had rounded ears. Since he was covered with many bags, he looked like he was a Merchant. Actually, Ark had let himself be dragged out without a word because he thought it might be some kind of event. But after coming out, the manner of speech and behavior showed he wasn\u2019t an NPC.</p><br/><p> \u201cThey call me Sid. As you can see, I\u2019m a Hobbit Merchant.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019m Ark, but, do you know me?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cNope, this is the first time we\u2019ve met. But it was a pity to watch you, so I intervened.\u201d</p><br/><p> \"What do you mean by a pity?\"</p><br/><p> \u201cThis village\u2019s store is famous in the area for having a low market value. The more you sell, the more you lose. Earlier, you figured the japtem you were selling was at market price, but you can\u2019t find out the true market value like that. If items with high and low values are mixed, there are lots of times when you feel it\u2019s generally an alright deal since the sum is similar to what you expect on average. Plus, the value of pearls is low because this village is close to the seaside. If you take them to a city two days away from here and sell, you\u2019ll get about 40 Silver a piece.\u201d</p><br/><p> \"40 Silver a piece! It that true?\"</p><br/><p> Didn\u2019t it mean he could get a whole 120 Gold more just by investing two days into travelling? Cold sweat ran down his back. He had been about to squander 120 Gold from a momentary mistake.</p><br/><p> \u201cOf course, and if I help you a bit, there\u2019s a way to earn another 48 Gold or so.\u201d Sid laughed as he implied more profit.</p><br/><p> At this point, Ark was more wary than surprised.</p><br/><p> \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as \u2018free\u2019 in this world though?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cOf course, it\u2019s give and take. There is something I want. Don\u2019t you want to hear the details?\u201d</p><br/><p> The profession of Merchant was rather vague. Merchant was the sole profession who could carry 6 bags. In addition, they were able to learn all sorts of production skills, and they received a considerable bonus when dealing with NPCs. Even if their Intimacy was at rock bottom, they could gain a 20% profit from buying and selling with high trading ability. Thanks to that, they could grasp a fair amount of money from their beginning days.</p><br/><p> The problem was combat. Since they carry a lot of luggage, they didn\u2019t have a single combat-related skill, and even received a huge penalty in combat. Even if they were over level 50, defeating a single level 20 monster on their own was too much. Additionally, the EXP they could get from defeating a monster was only 50%.</p><br/><p> A Merchant raises their level through trading. They use the market prices of goods between various village and cities. They sell goods they bought at a cheap price in a place where it has a higher market value. This was the basic growth method of a Merchant.</p><br/><p> Of course, they couldn\u2019t raise the EXP and earn money simply by trading, because the market prices constantly changes. For a Merchant, information is their lifeline. If they weren\u2019t able to constantly keep their ears open and accurately predict the market value, they would suffer sorely. Even if they traded successfully, there were cases where they actually succumbed to bankruptcy. It was a complex profession, in its own way. It was hard to raise, but the growth factor had its own kind of fun.</p><br/><p> They traded while carrying bags in the beginning, but, later, they could buy a wagon or a merchant ship to ferry more trade goods. Moreover, they could ply the top ranks and take the lead in trade between Kingdoms.</p><br/><p> The larger a single transaction, farther they go, and more they trade while passing through more dangerous places, the greater the EXP and skill proficiency they can gain.</p><br/><p> However, New World was a place with poor public safety. The travels of a Merchant, with their nonexistent combat ability, was an adventure gambling their life and fortune. If they encountered a powerful thief monster while traveling, they would suffer a huge loss. If it was really bad, they would even have to declare bankruptcy. Therefore, they needed to hire mercenary NPCs or high-leveled users as guards for long distances. This was also what Sid proposed to Ark.</p><br/><p> \u201cGiran, a commerce city, is two days away from this village. It\u2019s like a capital for Merchants and production-class users. And the pearls you have, Ark-nim, are a material greatly sought by production-class users. Many Beginner and Intermediate production items require pearls, you see. Of course, since the supply is always insufficient at Giran, the market price is at its highest. Honestly, if I could afford it, it\u2019s to the point that I\u2019d want to buy them right away.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cBasically, you\u2019re asking me to escort you to Giran?\u201d</p><br/><p> As Ark Made an unreadable expression, Sid quickly added, \u201cYou definitely won\u2019t regret it. I have the skill to trade jewels, so if I trade in your place, I can get 15% more. Considering the market price of pearls in is 40 Silver, then the current total is 320 Gold. 15% on 320 Gold is 48 Gold. So, in conclusion, you can make 168 more Gold than the store from earlier. If I also sell the japtem, you can receive a bit more. It\u2019s good for me, since I\u2019ll raise my EXP, and Ark-nim gets to make more money.\u201d</p><br/><p> '168 Gold.'</p><br/><p> Though he didn\u2019t use Eyes of the Cat, Ark\u2019s eyes glowed golden. He could earn an additional 168 Gold by investing two days of in-game time, 16 hours.</p><br/><p> Although he made a rule of not trusting users, it was a different story for this much profit. 168 Gold was 1,680,000 won. It wasn\u2019t an amount he could easily ignore when living a life that required even a single penny more. Moreover, he\u2019d already been thinking of looking for the surrounding cities anyway. If he went with Sid, who knew the road, he could cut down the time.</p><br/><p> However, Ark still felt uneasy about readily accepting. Reselling the pearls, didn\u2019t that actually mean Ark would have to hand over all the pearls to him? How could he trust him and hand over the pearls?</p><br/><p> As if he knew what Ark was thinking, Sid laughed as he pulled out parchment and a pen. Then, when he wrote a few things down and passed it to Ark, a new information window popped up.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> Merchant's Contract</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr><tr><td><br/><p> This is the contract for recording when a Merchant\u2019s profession specialty skill is used for the business of re-selling, exchanging, or acting as the proxy of another user.</p><br/><p> If you sign the contract, the Merchant will be validated to make deals, has the right to act as the proxy for the other user\u2019s business, and is obligated to return the promised sum. If the Merchant violates the contract, the Merchant Guild will be alerted, the Merchant\u2019s reliability stat and fame will plummet, and you can charge twice as much as the contracted amount. When the contract is complete, the contract will be automatically discarded.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr><tr><td><br/><p> Contract Contents: Resale of Ark\u2019s pearls, the contract will come into effect the moment the pearls are handed to Sid in Giran. Sid must give all the money obtained from the sale of pearls to Ark.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> \u201cNow, you can believe me with this, eh?\u201d</p><br/><p> A contract can be set up from a normal trade to a loan, bill, special trade, or almost any situation. It was like a document certifying that if there was a problem by any chance, all the responsibility would fall on the Merchant. The reason Merchants had high reliability from other users was exactly thanks to this unique contract skill.</p><br/><p> \u2018Definitely\u2026 if there\u2019s a contract like this, there won\u2019t be any chance of getting backstabbed.\u2019</p><br/><p> \"Okay, I'll accompany you.\"</p><br/><p> \"Great choice. Since you were able to obtain so many pearls, you should be over level 60, right?\"</p><br/><p> \"I'm level 65.\"\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cThat\u2019s acceptable. Since we\u2019ve finally gotten 3 people, we can be on our way.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cHuh? There are other companions?\u201d</p><br/><p> \"There are two ways to get to Giran. The long way would take about 3 to 4 days. But if we want to get there in 2 days time, the only way is to cross Grey Ridge. However, high level monsters like Trolls and Stalkers are camped out on Grey Ridge, so we need 3 level 60 players.\u201d</p><br/><p> \"But I'm...\"</p><br/><p> \"The other people are waiting at the inn. Let\u2019s go, I will introduce them to you.\"</p><br/><p> Sid dragged Ark to the inn without giving him any time to say a word. Two men, named Leo and Hargen, were sitting in the inn. Seeing as they were wearing plate armor, both seemed to be in combat-related professions.</p><br/><p> Once Sid introduced Ark, they expressed looks of obvious dislike.</p><br/><p> \u201cSid-nim, you didn\u2019t mention your intent to find another companion.\u201d</p><br/><p> \"We can pass the Grey Mountains with just the two of us.\"</p><br/><p> \"I'm sorry. We met by chance inside the store, so we decided to go together. I know the two of you are enough, but as I've said before, I have a reason to get to Giran as soon as possible. Three is faster than two.\"</p><br/><p> \u201cAnd the escort fee?\u201d asked Hargen, who had an axe tattoo on his face, as he glanced at Ark.</p><br/><p> \"I will pay the escort fee we first agreed upon, since Ark-nim is also going to Giran with the intent to sell goods. I decided to make the sale on his behalf as payment in exchange for escorting me.\"</p><br/><p> \u201cWhat did you agree to sell for him that would substitute for the escort fee?\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Pearls. Perhaps because he wasn\u2019t able to visit a village for long time, he collected quite a lot.\"</p><br/><p> Sid was boundlessly talkative. Whether it was in-game or real life, there are many humans who will cluster if it seems like you have some money. As expected, as soon as they heard Ark had items worth quite a sum, the two warriors examined Ark with gummy eyes.</p><br/><p> Though their appearances were unlikable, their actions were just as disagreeable. However, it would be no good for him to withdraw when he had already agreed to accompany Sid just because he didn\u2019t like them.</p><br/><p> \u2018I won't see them after 16 hours anyway, so I\u2019ll endure.\u2019</p><br/><p> After finishing his conversation with the warriors, Sid took out a scroll. It was a [Low-Level Inspection] scroll.</p><br/><p> \"Then before we go, I would like to do a basic check up. Please understand.\u201d</p><br/><p> The very first thing a Merchant did when choosing a player mercenary or an escort was to check their information. If they were chaotic players, then there was the chance of being backstabbed. Since the scroll was low level, Ark couldn\u2019t check the information. Therefore, Sid explained for Ark.</p><br/><p> \u201cLeo-nim is level 64 and Hargen-nim is level 62, both of them job-changed to Warrior.\"</p><br/><p> Warrior was an open profession, but it was a special profession that required 150 Strength.</p><br/><p> If you didn\u2019t raise your character while intending to become a Warrior from the beginning, it would be difficult to job-change even at level 30. In other words, they were players who had prior knowledge before they began playing the game. They were users who knew much as information as Sid.</p><br/><p> \"Wow, Ark-nim is really level 65. With this party, 10 hours will be enough to cross Grey Ridge. But your profession is Dark Walker. This is the first time I\u2019ve heard of it. What kind of profession is it?\"</p><br/><p> \"It\u2019s an ordinary thief,\" Ark answered lightly.</p><br/><p> Perhaps it was the image of the name \u2018Dark Walker\u2019, but Sid and the Warriors nodded without thinking much about it. Thief-related professions weren\u2019t popular, so there were almost no people who knew the details behind them.</p><br/><p> \"Ark-nim is the highest level-wise, but it\u2019ll probably be a bit difficult to take the lead since you\u2019re a Thief. Please leave the front to Leo and Hargen and cover the back. Is that okay?\"</p><br/><p> \"Yes, that\u2019s comfortable for me too.\"</p><br/><p> \"Then, we\u2019ll leave after another 20 minutes.\"</p><br/><p> \"We\u2019re not going to go right away?\"</p><br/><p> When Ark, to whom every minute and second was precious, asked that, Leo snickered and asked, \"Perhaps you\u2019ve never rested in an inn before?\"</p><br/><p> The cheapest inns took 1 Silver and the expensive places took up to 1 Gold.</p><br/><p> Heath can be recovered while resting on the ground, so why would you pay money to rest at an inn? That\u2019s why Ark had never entered an inn.</p><br/><p> But Sid explained with a surprised expression.</p><br/><p> \"Like the time in the store, Ark-nim doesn't seem to know much about the game despite being level 65. The reason people pay to stay in an inn is because of the buff.\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Buff?\"</p><br/><p> \u201cYou can get a buff if you rest at an inn. It\u2019s a buff that lasts 1 hour per 10 minutes, for a maximum of 3 hours. The inns have different prices because the buff effects are different. There are places that slightly raise Strength or Agility. Some places even have a buff that raise EXP gain by 20%. This place increases movement speed by 30% and Health by 10%. There is merit in waiting for 30 minutes.\u201d</p><br/><p> He had no idea. He didn\u2019t think inns would have such a secret.</p><br/><p> \u2018No wonder everyone was visiting inns strangely often...\u2019</p><br/><p> It was information he could have used if he\u2019d known beforehand. Basic information like this wasn\u2019t on the site forums. No, it could be that it was too basic to even put on the forums. In any case, Ark didn\u2019t even know such basic information because he\u2019d never interacted with users much.</p><br/><p> 'Minor info like this can be a big help in the game.\u2019</p><br/><p> He added another goal of the journey. 'For 16 hours, I need to gather some info.'</p><br/><p> He couldn't keep living as a beginner forever.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><br/><p>* * *</p><br/><p> \"Bring it on, Giant's Strength!\"</p><br/><p> At the booming cry, the muscles in Leo\u2019s body pulsed as they grew.</p><br/><p> It was the might of the job specific skill that increases Strength and Stamina by 30.</p><br/><p> With increased Strength, Leo swung his shield and hammer as he charged at a Troll.</p><br/><p> A Troll is a humongous, 4 meter tall monster, but his opponent was a Warrior! A fighter who specializes in hunting big monsters.</p><br/><p> As all sorts of skills were applied, the Troll staggered as it lost its balance with each strike of the hammer. When the final blow was struck on its brow, the Troll collapsed weakly. At the same time, Hargen faced a Stalker while swinging his two-handed axe.</p><br/><p> Leo and Hargen boasted their incredible strength as Warriors.</p><br/><p> Equipped with a shield and plate armor, Leo took decent blows without a care, and the Stalker getting hit by Hargen wielding his two-handed axe was getting thrown around like a baseball. They didn\u2019t land critical blows because they were Strength-focused characters, but they easily took out a level 73 troll and three level 66 Stalkers with only normal hits.</p><br/><p> Regardless, Ark made an apathetic expression.</p><br/><p> 'They fight in a really boring manner.'</p><br/><p> The two Warriors were weirdly strong for their level. Based on fighting techniques alone, they were incomparably lousy. They didn\u2019t even consider avoiding the attacks coming at them. That was characteristic of fighters wearing high defense plate armor. They ignored incoming attacks and just blindly swung their weapons. They didn\u2019t pay any attention to distributing their power, managing the distance, or accuracy. They also kept using their skills until all their Mana ran out.</p><br/><p> After clearing a group of monsters, Hargen hefted the axe onto his shoulder and boasted, \"Hahaha, what did I tell you? With just Leo and me, even Grey Ridge is no problem. From now on we\u2019ll handle it, so Sid-nim and Ark-nim, just watch from the back.\"</p><br/><p> Of course he was doing just that.</p><br/><p> 'I can\u2019t understand deliberately rushing up to fight.'\u00a0</p><br/><p> The group made a party in the village and hit the road. Thanks to this, the EXP was automatically shared even if he didn\u2019t fight. Granted, you could get more EXP by contributing more to the fight, but it wasn\u2019t worth the loss of equipment durability.</p><br/><p> In addition, Ark had no experience in party hunting. Since Leo and Hargen fought in a completely different manner, there would be too many problems if Ark tried to squeeze in.</p><br/><p> \u2018Well, since it\u2019s only a hunting ground of this level, I\u2019ll just sit back.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark distanced himself and spent his time striking the backs of fleeing monsters.</p><br/><p> \"Good work. Here\u2019s some food!\"</p><br/><p> Once the fight ended, Sid immediately brought out food. Sid showed an extremely submissive attitude to the reliable Mercenaries. Well, since they were outside the village, Sid's life was in the hands of the Mercenaries, so that was a given.</p><br/><p> Carrying as many as 6 bags at once, it was was profession that could get a hold of a lot of money from the beginning. There was once a time when Ark was envious of Merchants.</p><br/><p> But, after looking at Sid, those thoughts disappeared. They do earn money, but without the help of other players, they wouldn\u2019t even be able to trade properly.</p><br/><p> They had to waste their money to pay escort fees and bow to the tastes of others. It wasn\u2019t a profession that suited the single-minded Ark.</p><br/><p> \u2018Even though he said there\u2019s a comfortable path, why does he want to employ Mercenaries to travel by this road?\u2019</p><br/><p> With sudden doubt, Ark asked while chewing on the free food, \"Why are you in such a hurry?\"</p><br/><p> \u201cI spent my fortune on silk from the Southern region. However, the prices of silk can change in just a few days. If Merchants who bought silk at the same time were to sell them in Giran, then I can incur a loss instead. Since I invested my whole fortune on it, it could bankrupt me. So in order to get there even one day sooner, I haven't slept properly in days.\u201d</p><br/><p> \"If the market price is good, how much would you earn?\"</p><br/><p> \"I still won\u2019t earn a lot. Silk doesn't have a large margin. Price gain is around 2%? With the travel fee and escort fee on top of that, there\u2019s nothing left.\u201d</p><br/><p> Perched on top of a rock, Sid answered while swinging his legs.</p><br/><p> \u201cBut, since I\u2019ve invested my fortune on this, as long as I get a profit, my EXP will greatly increase. The greater the risk, the greater the experience. And since silk\u2019s market value changes frequently, there aren\u2019t many Merchants who trade it in bulk, so it\u2019s a good opportunity to raise my market share. Truthfully, that is my objective, rather than money or experience.\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Market share?\"</p><br/><p> The lives of combat professions relied on EXP and items, but Merchants relied on profit and market shares. Market share was a kind of reward provided to players who consistently traded one type of good. A Merchant with a set amount of market share could get all sorts of bonuses. They can also be exempted from taxes, get quests from craftsmen NPC\u2019s, and get profit from related trade goods. If they held the maximum share, they could even earn a monopolized trading privilege with a Lord.</p><br/><p> The additional effects of that were enormous. You acquired info about which items would soon be in demand, and, once you gained a monopolized relationship, raising your level or making money was a cinch. Therefore, the Merchants\u2019 fight to raise market share first was vicious.</p><br/><p> Some Merchants even went as far as to suffer a loss to lower market value if they saw another Merchant coming in with trade goods from afar.</p><br/><p> Even if it wasn\u2019t from player interference, prices plummeted and skyrocketed if New World\u2019s economy and political situation changed. Because of this, Merchants always have to be keen and able to read the flow of the whole continent.</p><br/><p> Information soon becomes money. To Merchants, this is common sense.</p><br/><p> Sid held vast information as an effect of that.</p><br/><p> \u201cOne day, I will get a monopoly on the economy of the Schudenberg Kingdom.\u201d</p><br/><p> Sid stamped his foot as he boldly revealed his ambition.</p><br/><p> Although seeing a small, cute Hobbit talking boldly was not very convincing...</p><br/><p> In any case, Sid was risking everything on this journey.</p><br/><p> He poured in his whole fortune in order to raise market share, and even bought silk with a loan from the Merchant Guild. If the market value plummeted before he arrived, it was instant bankruptcy for him, and he\u2019d be reduced to sewing leather and getting peanuts in a corner of the city.</p><br/><p> 'Being a Merchant isn't an easy profession either.'</p><br/><p> Ark felt it was actually much harder to be Merchant than a fighter.\u00a0</p><br/><p> Then, while Ark and Sid were talking, Leo and Hargen were whispering amongst themselves from a distance. They\u2019d been doing that more often after entering Grey Ridge.</p><br/><p> 'I have a really bad feeling about this...'</p><br/><p> Out of nowhere, he suddenly got an uncomfortable feeling.</p><br/><p> Ark's ominous sense hit the mark.</p><br/><p> 2 hours after leaving village, the party had reached the entrance region of Grey Ridge. After sweeping another monster mob and resting, a message suddenly popped up.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><div></div><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> - You have been kicked out from the party.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> Leo, who was commanding the fight in the front, had the position of party leader. In other words, Leo kicked Ark out of the party, and it wasn\u2019t just Ark. Sid, who also got the expulsion message, tilted his head.</p><br/><p> \u201cExcuse me, Leo-nim. I\u2019ve been disbanded from the party?\u201d</p><br/><p> Leo suddenly changed his expression as he said, \u201cWe aren\u2019t going any further.\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Huh? What are you talking about?\" Sid blinked as if he did not understand the situation.</p><br/><p> Leo grinned and swung his hammer around.</p><br/><p> \u201cSince there\u2019s no more business to see with you, I\u2019m telling ya to hand over all the silk and fuck off. Ark, if you leave all your pearls and scram like a good boy, I won't kill you in light of our time so far. You understand without further explanation, yes?\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Per-perhaps from the beginning\u2026?\"</p><br/><p> \u201cOf course. Do you think I, Hargen, followed you this far just to earn peanuts?\u201d</p><br/><p> \"Y-you can't. These goods are what I\u2019ve bought with my entire fortune. If I lose this I will go bankrupt. I would rather die!\"</p><br/><p> \u201cIf you say that much, then there\u2019s no choice. Damnit, even though this is expensive.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> Leo took out and ripped a red scroll. \"Target Sid, designated mark: silk.\"</p><br/><p> Then, a stream of light came pouring out and hit Sid.</p><br/><p> 'Is it an attack scroll?'</p><br/><p> Ark flinched reflexively, but Sid didn't receive any damage. It doesn\u2019t seem to be an attack scroll. However Sid's face immediately turned pale, and he sank down while trembling. Tears poured from his round eyes.</p><br/><p> \"Please let me go. If I sell the silk in Giran I will give you 50%.\"</p><br/><p> \"Why would I do something that difficult when there is an easier way to earn money?\"</p><br/><p> Ark couldn't comprehend the current situation at all.</p><br/><p> When a character became Chaotic, they received a huge penalty. They can\u2019t buy or sell anything from the store, let alone enter villages larger than a certain size. They also received criminal status.</p><br/><p> If they became Chaotic once, they could remove the status by staying in jail for a few days and paying a fine. Of course, the jail time and the fine were based on their Chaotic value and their level. For those above level 60, the jail time as well as the fine would be no small amount.</p><br/><p> No matter how much they wanted the silk, it wasn't worth turning into a Chaotic player. So although Ark had been suspicious of the two\u2019s attitudes, he hadn\u2019t imagined the worst case scenario.</p><br/><p> That wasn\u2019t all he couldn\u2019t understand. Since he was a Merchant, there would be some japtem inside his bags besides the silk. Even if Sid was murdered, the chance of the silk dropping was rare. However, Leo and Sid both seem to think the silk was guaranteed to drop.</p><br/><p> 'Just what exactly is going on here?'</p><br/><p> \"I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s unavoidable since we also need to survive!\"\u00a0</p><br/><p> As Leo abruptly rushed forward swinging his two-handed axe, Ark still hadn't come up with a plan. If they were monsters, he was confident he could take down two or three even if they were level 70.</p><br/><p> However, his opponent were players, two of them were too much to face even for Ark.</p><br/><p> 'Should I run away?\u2019 Ark was thinking that, but then\u2014\u00a0</p><br/><p> \"Dammit, then I will have to prepare for some losses!\"</p><br/><p> Sid quickly took out a scroll and, when he ripped it, disappeared with light. It was the effect of the incredibly rare and expensive [Warp] scroll.</p><br/><p> \"That bastard, he was hiding a warp scroll.\"</p><br/><p> Leo ground his teeth after slamming the hammer on the ground.</p><br/><p> \"Hng, did you think I\u2019ll let such easy prey get away? [Trace]!\"</p><br/><p> Without delay, Leo quickly used another scroll and his eyes glowed red. With glowing red eyes, Leo looked around and found Sid scrambling away about 200 meters away. It was an odd fight using all sorts of scrolls.</p><br/><p> Leo shouted while chasing Sid, \"Hargen, you take care of robbing him! You can face him alone, yeah?\"</p><br/><p> \"Of course.\" Hargen laughed as he looked at Ark. \"You don\u2019t intend to obediently hand over the pearls anyways, right?\u201d</p><br/><p> Hargen did the same thing as Leo\u2014 he took out a scroll and marked the pearls. As with before, Ark couldn\u2019t figure out the scroll\u2019s identity, but it seems it didn\u2019t deal any damage. Afterwards, Hargen immediately swung his two-handed axe as he charged.</p><br/><p> It was an absurd situation.</p><br/><p> \u2018What\u2019s with this guy? What does he believe in, to think he can stand up against me?'</p><br/><p> Hargen was 3 levels lower than Ark. He definitely knew that fact. So why is he trying to take Ark down alone?</p><br/><p> 'Does he think he can take me down because I\u2019m a Thief?'</p><br/><p> If so, it was actually welcoming. Ark had been worried because there were two level 60+ players. If there was one opponent, even if the opponent was a higher level, he was confident he could defeat him.</p><br/><p> Ark quickly did an evasive movement as he swung his sword.</p><br/><p> A heavy sound rang out, but Hargen immediately used the skill again as if he didn\u2019t receive much impact. Ark fended off the blow with this sword, but he still took an incredible amount of damage.</p><br/><p> 'Wh-what? Is this really damage of a level 62 player?'</p><br/><p> It was completely different from what he\u2019d seen while they were fighting monsters. Ark used Eyes of the Cat, and his face hardened.</p><br/><p> 'Huh? What is going on?'</p><br/><p> With Eyes of the Cat, he saw Hargen\u2019s level was actually 71.</p><br/><p> In addition, he was a Chaotic player!</p><br/><p> He was certain Sid checked their levels and status before leaving the village. Level 62 with Neutral status. But in just 4 hours, the info had changed to something completely different. After using his head for a moment, Ark finally understood the situation.</p><br/><p> 'I fell for it. Was Sid also a part of this?'</p><br/><p> Sid had checked the info. And since Sid, whom he had met by chance, had said the info was like that, Ark had just believed him. That situation had been so natural that even the doubtful Ark had blindly believed it.</p><br/><p> So In the end, Sid and Leo had just been acting!</p><br/><p> 'They were aiming for me from the beginning. Damn bastards!'</p><br/><p> Rage surged within him.</p><br/><p> 'I definitely shouldn\u2019t trust the likes of players!'</p><br/><p> \"Alright, let\u2019s go at it then. I will make you regret believing in your level and coming at me alone. Dark Blade!\"</p><br/><p> Lancel's sword grazed a spot on Hargen\u2019s side that was glowing red.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> - You have dealt a critical hit!</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> Hargen flinched and took a step back. Even with his plated armour, he lost 10% of his Health in one blow.</p><br/><p> \"This bastard, he has good luck. Though it\u2019ll be useless!\"</p><br/><p> Hargen still made an expression of overwhelming confidence.</p><br/><p> It seemed he believed the critical hit was nothing but a fluke. Hargen\u2019s level was 71, Ark\u2019s was 65. With a whopping 6 level difference, he believed there was no way he could lose. But it didn\u2019t take long for him to realize how terrible a misunderstanding that was.</p><br/><p> The accuracy and attack speed he had polished underwater!</p><br/><p> Ark's sword and kicks rained down like a flash.</p><br/><p> Ba-ba-ba-bam!</p><br/><p> Kicks were different from sword strikes. Swords only gave damage, but kicks gave knockback, or a stun effect at a set rate. In addition, the enemy was a heavily armored Warrior; whenever the shower of kicks imparted a special status effect, he couldn\u2019t balance his weight and was pushed back as he staggered.</p><br/><p> \"Wha-what? What is wrong with my body?\"</p><br/><p> Hargen shouted his frustration at the special effects of the kicks.</p><br/><p> The heavily armored Hargen couldn't follow Ark's movements. He also couldn't defend himself properly. Trained from underwater battle, Ark\u2019s sword precisely pierced into the gaps of the armor.</p><br/><p> A heavily armored fighter was no different from a crab. The joints in armor have very low defense. In addition, the Dark Blade Ark occasionally released totally ignored defense.</p><br/><p> In an instant, Hargen only had 10% of his Health left.</p><br/><p> \"H-how the hell did this happen?\"</p><br/><p> In front of the suffering Hargen\u2019s eyes, Ark lifted his leg. It paused in the air for a split second before falling like a thunder bolt down on Hargen\u2019s head.</p><br/><p> HAMMER KICK!</p><br/><p> Stunned, Hargen fell to one knee. His body flashed red.</p><br/><p> Double Critical Chance!</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> - With Double Critical Chance, you have landed 2x a critical hit.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> Ark seized the opportunity and killed Hargen.</p><br/><p> \"There\u2019s no way this can be...\"</p><br/><p> As if he couldn\u2019t believe it, Hargen stammered as he was forced to log out.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td><br/><p> - You have defeated a level 71 Chaotic player. Fame +40.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> The helmet Hargen had been wearing tumbled down.</p><br/><p> \"Dedric, turn into a Bat and find Sid and Leo!\"</p><br/><p> Ark summoned Dedric and ground his teeth.</p><br/><p> If they\u2019d been playing Ark, they would definitely be waiting nearby for the fight to end. The bastards had conspired and tricked Ark. He was of a mind to chase them even to the depths of hell for revenge. If he didn't kill them, his rage would not subside.</p><br/><p> 'They can never be forgiven!'</p><br/><p> \"They\u2019re not too far from here!\"</p><br/><p> \"Lead the way.\"</p><br/><p> Ark equipped the Guardian Armor of the Merpeople he\u2019d been saving and had Dedric take the lead.</p><br/><p> The Guardian Armor couldn\u2019t be repaired by repair boxes. The only way to repair it was with Magic Restoration, but he\u2019d tried not to use it since that was only Intermediate. But the current situation was different.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><br/><p>* * *</p><br/><p> After entering the forest, he saw a strange scene unfolding.</p><br/><p> He\u2019d been certain the two would be giggling together, but the situation was no different from before. Sid was running as if his feet were on fire. Leo was chasing after him spitting curses. As if he\u2019d already taken a few hits, Sid had only about 30% of his Health left.</p><br/><p> 'What is going on? Aren't they on the same side?'</p><br/><p> At that moment, Leo's hammer hit Sid's back.</p><br/><p> It wasn\u2019t an attack a Merchant could defend against with their incomparably lousy defense.</p><br/><p> Sid collapsed as he instantly fell into a critical condition.</p><br/><p> \"Dammit, you nasty bastard!\"</p><br/><p> \"Huhuhu, isn't this also one of the enjoyments of the game?\" Leo raised his hammer while sporting a vile smile.</p><br/><p> At that moment, Leo's face was covered by Dedric.</p><br/><p> \"Wh-what is this? A Bat?\"</p><br/><p> Ba-bang!</p><br/><p> At the same time, a strong attack landed on Leo\u2019s back.</p><br/><p> He\u2019d been watching the situation from a distance, but Ark shortened the gap in a moment and let fly a Backstab attack. He couldn't understand what was going on, but for now he decided they weren't allies.</p><br/><p> Leo turned his head and his facial expression turned twisted.</p><br/><p> \"H-how did you...?\"</p><br/><p> \"Ask your friend after you revive.\"</p><br/><p> Ark didn\u2019t give him a moment and immediately poured forth a chain of Sword-Hand attacks.</p><br/><p> 'The bastard\u2019s level is 73, but if he\u2019s around Hargen's skill, he isn't a tough opponent.'</p><br/><p> Leo was stronger than Hargen.</p><br/><p> First, his level was higher, and his equipment was better. Additionally, because of his shield, it wasn't easy to aim at the gaps in his armor.</p><br/><p> But Leo was still not a match for Ark.</p><br/><p> \"Uhh, what is this? A Bat?\"</p><br/><p> Dedric, trying to earn back some trust from Ark, desperately held on. He repeatedly scratched Leo\u2019s face while matching the timing of the hammer swings and backing off.</p><br/><p> As expected, after receiving Ark\u2019s rigorous training, Dedric's battle sense was outstanding. In the current situation, he was determining what attack would be most helpful to Ark. As Dedric continued with the attacks, Leo\u2019s accuracy with his hammer dramatically fell. Such sloppy attacks were met with crazy strong counter-attacks. As Leo swung his hammer, a counter attack swept past through the gap in the shield.</p><br/><p> If a counter-attack succeeds, the attack power increases by 50%!</p><br/><p> No matter how good the armor was, there is no way it could handle 150% of the normal attack. In addition, armor is not something that can be continuously used. Leo\u2019s armor became tattered in the blink of an eye and his Health was dropping wildly.</p><br/><p> \"Dammit! You're dead!\"</p><br/><p> Pressed to near critical state, Leo pulled out a potion.</p><br/><p> \u2018High-grade recovery potion!\u2019</p><br/><p> There were all kinds of potions. There is the low class potion, which recovers 100 Health, intermediate potion, which recovers 300 Health, and high class potion which recovers 500 Health. There are also no specific restriction in terms of drinking a Health potion, so as long as one had money they could recover Health anytime. Ark had never once doubted a system like this.</p><br/><p> If so, didn\u2019t that mean you would never die if you drank high-class potions like water? However, Ark soon found the flaw in this system.</p><br/><p> It lay in the time it takes to drink the potion. While opening the bag and drinking the potion, they are in a completely defenseless state. Of course, this will lead to a higher chance of receiving a critical hit. In the end, even if they drink a 500 Health potion, if they were to lose 500 Health while they were drinking it, it would do them no good.</p><br/><p> That wasn\u2019t the only disadvantage. You could intentionally interfere with the player trying to drink a potion. If you attacked the hand, you could make them drop the potion. Ark had learned that when Bat had shoved himself into Andel\u2019s mouth while he was trying to drink a potion.</p><br/><p> Because of this, Ark almost never drank potions even when fighting monsters. Of course, the same applied when facing players, who were smarter than monsters.</p><br/><p> 'Idiot, he was just a high-leveled moron.'</p><br/><p> \"Dark Charge!\"</p><br/><p> In fact, Dedric was of a higher level than Leo in the ability to deal with a situation. A black aura poured from Dedric\u2019s mouth and blocked Leo's vision. Then, while Leo was confused, Dedric charged powerfully and sent a flying kick.</p><br/><p> \"Agh! Oowww, my head.\"</p><br/><p> With a thump, Dedric staggered about with a fist-sized lump on his head. Leo, who\u2019d been hurriedly about to drink the potion, shook and stumbled as if he\u2019d taken quite a shock.</p><br/><p> Ark ordered without any delay, \u201cSnake, it\u2019s an item! Eat it!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> Wrapped around Ark\u2019s waist, Snake opened its eyes wide and stuck its tongue out. Like a frog catching a fly, it wrapped its tongue around the potion and swallowed it.</p><br/><p> The so-called Familiar combo attack!</p><br/><p> After seeing Snake smack its lips, Leo shouted his shock.</p><br/><p> \"EH! Wh-what is this?\"</p><br/><p> \"What\u2019s what? You're dead anyways. Dark Blade!\"</p><br/><p> \"Ah, no!\" Leo quickly held up his shield.</p><br/><p> But before Ark's blade reached the shield, it vanished</p><br/><p> Then it appeared in front of Leo's nose and dealt a Critical Hit.</p><br/><p> Defense was ignored, and since Dedric, who had been promoted to the magic sword's owner, was summoned, the attack power was even greater. With a violent scream, Leo flew back. He tumbled on the ground until he hit the trunk of the tree and was forced to log out.</p><br/><p> Along with 40 bonus Fame, a hammer, two scrolls fell.</p><br/><p> \"A-Ark-nim...!\" Sid, who\u2019d been watching nervously, stammered with a surprised voice.</p><br/><p> Well, since the 8 level lower Ark had defeated Leo, of course he\u2019d be surprised.</p><br/><p> \"Th-thanks to you I survived. I was almost robbed and bankrupted.\"</p><br/><p> After collecting his wits, Sid jumped up and leapt onto Leo's corpse. The reason why the corpse didn't disappear for 24 hours was probably because the developers considered a use like this.</p><br/><p> \"This rotten bastard! Shitface!\"</p><br/><p> After panting as he vented his anger, Sid scratched his head.</p><br/><p> \"Because of me, Ark-nim was in danger. I'm truly ashamed.\"</p><br/><p> By then, Ark had furtively packed up his items. He turned his head. There was nothing but coldness in his eyes towards Sid.</p><br/><p> \"Just exactly what happened?\"</p><br/><p> \"What do you mean?\"</p><br/><p> \"Sid-nim, at the inn you said they were lower level than me. You also said nothing about them being Chaotic. So, I thought you and those guys were working together.\"</p><br/><p> \u201cNo, NO, I\u2019M NOT! I was also tricked!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cTricked? Didn\u2019t you use a scroll?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cWell, Ark-nim may not know.\u201d</p><br/><p> Sid thought for a moment before remembering the scrolls Leo had dropped.</p><br/><p> \u201cFirst, check the items Leo dropped. That would be faster.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There was no knowing what dangers there might be.</p><br/><p> The bitter experience of death penalties was a mistake Ark did not want to repeat. Therefore, he could only be at ease by gaining some levels before reaching the cave.</p><br/><p> On the second day of dedicating himself to hard-core hunting, Ark finally reached level 5.</p><br/><p> He invested all of the stat points from level 3 into Agility, and then put raised his strength to increase his attack power. Lastly, he put 10 points into Stamina to increase his Health. Since every point of Stamina raised his Health by 5, it was now at 155.</p><br/><p> This may be obvious, but Ark had become much stronger.</p><br/><p> At first, his life had gone down by 30 when he was scratched by a Wolf, but now it was down to about 20. Besides, he had gained exceptional fighting experience from defeating at least ten thousand Mice!</p><br/><p> If he was lucky, he could kill one Wolf after losing only 70 Health. It was something normal users at level five couldn\u2019t even be able to imagine.\u00a0</p><br/><p> As he hunted the way he wanted without a hitch, his confidence also rose.</p><br/><p> \u2018Should I slowly head over to the cave now?\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark rose from his seat. Only 30 wheat breads were left out of the 100 he had prepared.</p><br/><p> He drank water whenever needed, but he had been hard-pressed to do so with the wheat breads.</p><br/><p> If his satiety dropped to below 50, his stats temporarily fell.</p><br/><p> \u2018There are good points to learning how to cook...\u2019</p><br/><p> In New World, the art of cooking was its own skill.</p><br/><p> If the Cooking skill rose, it wasn\u2019t just the decreased fullness and Stamina that could be restored, but Strength and Stamina could also be temporarily raised. Additionally, a realistic taste could be savored. That\u2019s why everyone wanted to learn the Cooking skill.</p><br/><p> Nevertheless, Ark still had no thoughts of learning to cook.</p><br/><p> To learn a manufacturing skill, you have to meet the Master Artisan NPC, and the Cooking Master was in a faraway place. There would probably be an opportunity to learn it someday, so there was no reason invest the time to travel all the way there. Just learning the cooking skill didn\u2019t mean he\u2019d be able to immediately make luxurious dishes. He wouldn\u2019t even be able to afford the ingredients to cook the luxury food.</p><br/><p> There was also the inconvenience of having to carry the necessary ingredients. The bag Ark had gotten when he'd started was all he had, so he didn't have much storage space. He couldn't afford to carry cooking ingredients.</p><br/><p> It was definitely a vital skill, but there was no need for him to go through hell just to learn it early game.\u00a0</p><br/><p> 'In any case, wheat bread is good enough for now. Since I have 30 wheat breads left, it should be enough for a round trip to the cave.'</p><br/><p> Ark checked his map and began aggressively looking for the cave. He had already ventured deep into Harilal Mountain while hunting Wild Dogs and Wolves. The entrance to the cave was not far.</p><br/><p> He followed the mountain slope, and after 30 minutes of walking, a copse of old oaks emerged. His eyes picked up the cleverly hidden cave entrance within the copse.</p><br/><p> As soon as Ark put one foot into the cave, a sound effect similar to a sonorous shout rang out as the information window surfaced.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0 <ul><li>You have discovered a suspicious cave with an acrid smell and eerie chills flowing out of the deep and dark cave in the Harilal mountain range. You can feel that old secrets are being treasured here. - You have discovered a dungeon no one has found until now. Because you are a new explorer, if you register yourself in the Hall of Fame you will gain 500 experience and 50 fame. Will you like to register?</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> \"I refuse.\" Ark replied without hesitation.</p><br/><p> He had to hunt at least ten Wolves to get 500 experience. If he registered the cave in the Hall of Fame, a lot of people would find out about it.</p><br/><p> For an undiscovered cave like this, there was no knowing what secrets or items might be waiting.</p><br/><p> The greatest advantage of a newly discovered dungeon was that he could monopolise it. He hadn't scouted it yet, and there was a high chance that a higher level user might beat him to the punch.</p><br/><p> On the New World home page, there were simple-minded users who uploaded dungeon item lists and many others who laid in wait while biding their time.</p><br/><p> \u2018I\u2019d rather kill ten Wolves than to register this cave in the Hall of Fame.\u2019</p><br/><p> Once again, he was glad that he had done a lot of research.</p><br/><p> If he'd come here without knowing anything like the first time, he would've thoughtlessly registered it in the Hall of Fame.</p><br/><p> However, Ark was not the insipid person he used to be. It was common sense for him to be more cautious and alert than monsters, NPCs or even other users.</p><br/><p> 'Now, what exactly is in here.'</p><br/><p> Ark controlled his trembling excitement and stepped into the dungeon.</p><br/><p> The smell of something rotting was overflowing with realism and stimulated his senses. It was so strong and terrible that he wondered if there really was a need to make even smells so\u00a0<em>real</em>.\u00a0</p><br/><p> It happened when Ark had walked 100 meters into the cave.</p><br/><p> Suddenly, his foot sank into something squishy. Startled, he jumped and felt the ground wriggle and climb up. In another moment, the image of the blackness swallowing him flashed into his mind and he lashed out.</p><br/><p> \u201cWha-What\u2019s all this? Don\u2019t tell me they\u2019re all Mice?\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark turned pale with fright. The things that were crawling up from the ground were all Mice. That was not all. He hadn't noticed it until now, but the pitch black Mouse swarm was covering the entire cave.</p><br/><p> Every time the Mice moved, it was like a wriggling wave over the whole cave.</p><br/><p> The Mice emitted a terrible bloodthirst that made his spine go cold. The courage he had dedicated himself to raising was no use. Ark urgently flailed in the darkness. With one blow, a number of Mice went flying away and rolled onto the ground. That was thanks to the Mouse Hunter title he\u2019d received, which raised his attack power and chance of critical hits.</p><br/><p> \u2018Hmph, do you know how many Mice I\u2019ve killed until now?\u2019</p><br/><p> Once he saw how big of an effect his one blow had, his fear dissipated.</p><br/><p> No matter how many there were, in the end they were just Mice. With the attack bonus, even if he didn\u2019t land a critical hit, there was no need for a second blow.</p><br/><p> Without rest, Ark mowed down the Mice that were coming at him from all sides.</p><br/><p> However, the number of Mice did not seem to decline.</p><br/><p> \u2018Damn, if it goes on like this there\u2019ll be no end. I have to run away.\u2019</p><br/><p> \u201cThe Spirit of the Cat!\u201d</p><br/><p> Nyaaaaaaaaaaaaa-!</p><br/><p> Although he had learned it, he hadn\u2019t actually thought that he\u2019d be able to use it. Anyway, the Spirit of the Cat demonstrated an absolute effect on the Mice.</p><br/><p> As soon as Ark used the skill, a splittingly searing cat\u2019s cry pierced the air and the shape of a black cat appeared above his head. Upon seeing the cat\u2019s flashing eyes, the Mice were paralyzed with fear.</p><br/><p> In that space of time, Ark cut down the Mice in his path and escaped to the outside of the cave.</p><br/><p> Although the paralyzing effect on the Mice wore off quickly, they didn\u2019t chase him out of the cave.</p><br/><p> \u201cPhew, what a relief.\u201d</p><br/><p> Outside, Ark ate wheat bread and drank water to restore his stamina.</p><br/><p> For there to be an innumerable swarm of Mice... It was truly a dizzying experience.</p><br/><p> \u2018But I can\u2019t just give up like this.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark checked his quest window.</p><br/><p> The quest hadn\u2019t been updated yet. That meant he had to go in further. No, quest aside, he already had experience hunting tens and thousands of Mice. It would be stupid of him to give up on the quest just because the cave was infested with Mice.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u2018I charged right in since it was my first time and didn\u2019t know a thing, but I should be fine if I calmly work my self forward from the entrance.\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark entered the cave, cleared about one hundred Mice, and retreated. After doing this cycle three or four times, a sound effect rang out and a message window popped up.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0 <ul><li>You have learned a new skill. Sword Mastery (Beginner, Passive): You have taken the first step towards being a Swordsman. From now on, whenever you wield a sword, all penalties received shall disappear. You can now use your sword as an extension of your own hand. You have become more skilled with connecting your sword skills to circumstances when you use them with other skills. You will gain bonus attack power, based on your sword skill level. *It has become possible to use the effect of \u2018Swordsmanship\u2019 as a combo, with Hand-to-Hand Combat. (Swordsmanship follows the levels of Sword Mastery and Hand-to-Hand Combat and rises accordingly.)</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> \u2018Sword Mastery has finally appeared.\u2019</p><br/><p> When he was hunting in the village, it was almost always with bare hands. It had been a waste to use the sword to kill the Mice and have to pay the repair fee. That\u2019s why Sword Mastery, a skill that other users would have gained first, had only just appeared. However, it was fortunate that he had learned Sword Mastery later.</p><br/><p> When he was first catching the Mice, Ark hadn\u2019t known about the existence of a separate Sword Mastery skill. If he had known, he probably would have used his sword despite the repair fees.</p><br/><p> But because he hadn\u2019t known, he had continued to fight with his bare hands. Thanks to that, he had been able to learn Hand-to-Hand Combat. Although Hand-to-Hand Combat was a bare-handed skill, the bonuses applied slightly to every weapon he used.\u00a0</p><br/><p> The bonuses from Sword Mastery-- if they were combined with the bonuses from Hand-to-Hand Combat, then in actuality his attack power was raised by 1.5 times. That was an effect he was able to feel right away.</p><br/><p> \u2018Moving is very comfortable!\u2019</p><br/><p> Although he was wielding a sword there were no breaks in his movements</p><br/><p> The attacks flowed like water!</p><br/><p> Thanks to the effect of Sword Mastery, while he was wildly swinging his sword, he was also able to perform kicks. The skill that had been impossible until a little while ago had become possible. And without resting, he was able to ward off the attacking swarm of Mice.</p><br/><p> \u2018So I see that if a related skill is learned, then new abilities form too!\u2019</p><br/><p> For the Hand-to-Hand Combat he had regarded as trivial to be so useful was something he hadn\u2019t imagined.</p><br/><p> When his combined attacking power rose, he\u2019s hunting speed rose exponentially.\u00a0</p><br/><p> With a full health bar, he was able to hunt two hundred Mice with ease.</p><br/><p> After going into the cave five or six times like that, the entrance to the cave was jet-black with Mouse corpses. To make a rough estimate, a thousand of them had fallen over and died.</p><br/><p> He had killed so many that his level had gone up to 6 as well.</p><br/><p> Ark pushed past the disgusting Mouse corpses and went into the cave.</p><br/><p> Just then, something deep within the cave sparkled.</p><br/><p> When he got closer and looked, it was a body with only bones left.</p><br/><p> If a user dies, his corpse disappeared with his revival.</p><br/><p> \u2018So that must mean this is the corpse of an NPC.\u2019</p><br/><p> Then there was a big possibility that his quest information would be updated.</p><br/><p> Ark sifted through the remains and discovered a small piece of parchment on the inside.</p><br/><p> It may have been something the corpse had written; there was minute handwriting written on the surface.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0 <ul><li>- \u2018Unfortunate Traveler\u2019s left-behind piece of parchment\u2019 has been acquired. 3 years have passed since I received Sir Viscount Havestein\u2019s command and set out searching for its trails. And with divine intervention, I was able to find what I was searching for by pure chance. But to think such an unimaginable demon would be living within the cave. I was extremely caught off guard. If\u00a0<em>that</em>\u00a0was here, then I should have definitely anticipated trouble... Everything is my fault. Because I\u2019ve already come carelessly into the cave, I\u2019ve suffered a huge wound. Is the Viscount\u2019s desire going to come to an end like this? I am so bitter. It\u2019s regretful but the secret within the darkness of this cave will be...</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> Whatever was written in continuation of the parchment had been gnawed away by Mice.</p><br/><p> \u2018I can smell that there\u2019s more to this somewhere.\u2019</p><br/><p> As he\u2019d thought, the cave wasn\u2019t simply a Mouse cavern.</p><br/><p> He couldn\u2019t understand the contents of the parchment, but there was definitely something inside the cave. The probability that the mentioned \u2018that\u2019 was an item was high. Ark\u2019s motivation swelled inside him. He tucked the parchment away and continued into the cave.</p><br/><p> \u201cEuurgghh!\u201d</p><br/><p> With one blow, Ark threw three or four Mice to the floor.</p><br/><p> There were only Mice within the cave. The Mice at the entrance had been nothing. Wherever he went, there were Mice running at him from all directions.</p><br/><p> The number of Mice that were cut down and cut again seemed to increase more and more. But who was Ark? In Harun, he had cleared hundreds of Mice requests, and he had struck down as many as one thousand Mice and had earned the title of Mouse Hunter.\u00a0</p><br/><p> \u201cYou bastards, today you\u2019ve really met your match. SPIRIT OF THE CAT!\u201d</p><br/><p> He may have been driven into a corner, but at least there was no risk of death.</p><br/><p> When it became dangerous, he immediately used the Spirit of the Cat to paralyze the Mice and escaped from the cave.</p><br/><p> Ark crazily ran in and out of the cave and slowly stepped further and further into the cave. After 3 hours had passed, yet another problem emerged.</p><br/><p> \u2018I underestimated it because it was just a beginner dungeon, but it\u2019s deeper than I thought. But I only have 10 wheat breads left now.\u2019</p><br/><p> The problem was the wheat bread. If his satiety dropped, the rate of health restoration would severely decrease. If it dropped to below half, his stats would fall temporarily, and if it fell to the zero, in the worst case scenario, he could even die. If he ran out of wheat bread, there\u2019d be no way for him to continue exploring.</p><br/><p> \u2018Do I have to go back to the village and stock up on wheat bread?\u2019</p><br/><p> That was a problem in itself. Even if you cleared monsters, after a certain amount of time they spawned again. And the smaller they were, the faster they respawned. Though he\u2019d advanced hundreds of meters into the cave, if he went back to the village and came back, he\u2019d have to start from the beginning.</p><br/><p> \u2018I\u2019m gonna go crazy. If I knew it\u2019d be like this I wouldn\u2019t have sold the wheat bread....\u2019</p><br/><p> As Ark was having those thoughts, a brilliant plan surfaced in his mind.</p><br/><p> \u2018Could it be possible?\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark thought about it for a moment and stood up.</p><br/><p> \u2018Well, there\u2019s probably nothing to lose by trying.\u2019</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> *Swish, smack!*</p><br/><p> Ark was struck by a Wolf wandering on the outskirts of the cave.</p><br/><p> The Wolf snarled and leapt at him. Now, Wolves and the like were no match for Ark.</p><br/><p> Brandishing his sword like lightning, Ark put the Wolf into a near death. But when it came to the final blow, he put away his sword. While being careful not to kill the Wolf, he controlled his strength and struck it with his foot.</p><br/><p> *Yelp!*</p><br/><p> The Wolf whimpered as he kicked it aside.</p><br/><p> However, Ark held no mercy for it. He stared at it as it panted, when it seemed to get a little better he beat it, and after doing this for three minutes the Wolf finally went into a frenzy.</p><br/><p> *Awooo!*</p><br/><p> The forest violently shook, as the Wolf cried out with all of its remaining strength.</p><br/><p> A dozen Wolves who heard the heartrending story of their comrade rushed out at him.</p><br/><p> \u2018It\u2019s done!\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark had a smile full of satisfaction on his face as he rapidly fled towards the cave.\u00a0</p><br/><p> Ark quickly used Spirit of the Cat to paralyze the Mice and went deeper into the cave. When he reached a place where there were less Mice, the paralyzation wore off and the Mice piled themselves layer upon layer on Ark.</p><br/><p> \u2018I might even die if I fail!\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark didn\u2019t pull out his sword and concentrated on using all his strength to evade the attacks. But because there were so many Mice attacking him, he felt as if his life was getting sucked out with a straw. To top it all, the Wolves were pitching in too, so in an instant, he was bitten an extreme number of times.\u00a0</p><br/><p> However, soon after, the Wolves stopped attacking him. The Mice had started to attack the Wolves too.\u00a0</p><br/><p> The Wolf horde was startled when the enormous swarm of Mice ran at them. However, they were Wolves; the Wolves couldn\u2019t just tuck their tails and flee.</p><br/><p> The Wolves bared their fangs and started attacking the Mice.</p><br/><p> \u201cYes, just as planned!\u201d Ark shouted in delight.</p><br/><p> New World boasted a system that had few differences with reality. That meant whether they were animals or monsters, it was the same.</p><br/><p> In fact, even when Ark came to New World, he had seen instances of Wolves catching and eating rabbits and field Mice. That meant that natural enemies applied too.</p><br/><p> Ark, who had figured that out, had purposely gathered the Wolves and lured them into the cave.</p><br/><p> The result was a huge success. The best, most perfect situation had opened up for Ark. In the middle of the cave, the Wolf horde were leaping and bucking and the Mice were enveloped in chaos. Since the Mice must have judged the Wolves to be more dangerous than Ark, they were all running at the Wolves.</p><br/><p> Ark took a step back and watched the Mice and Wolves fight at his leisure. Each time his mana was restored, he used Spirit of the Cat.</p><br/><p> After 10 minutes had passed in that manner, the Mice were almost gone.</p><br/><p> \u201cHu hu hu. You did well.\u201d</p><br/><p> With a satisfied smile, Ark took care of the staggering Wolves.</p><br/><p> Although they were in a dying state, the Wolves still gave the proper amount of experience.</p><br/><p> Simply put, it was like taking a candy from a child!</p><br/><p> To earn this unexpected benefit... It was like killing two birds with one stone.</p><br/><p> \u2018Am I perhaps a genius?\u2019</p><br/><p> Although he\u2019d thought of it himself, it was truly a brilliant method. There were no restrictions on what methods you used to solve a quest. You could even go as far as to kill the person who gave you the request.</p><br/><p> Of course, in that case, the penalties attached were extreme, but the near infinite degree of freedom was one of New World\u2019s charming centerpoints.</p><br/><p> Even after that, Ark gathered all the Wolves in the area and had them fight with the Mice. Then he cleared off the Mice and Wolves that were left. Thanks to that, his level went up and up and he reached level 8, and although he\u2019d only consumed 2 wheat breads, he was able to go deeper into the cave.</p><br/><p> \u2018This is a really deep cave. Though I think I\u2019ve gone really deep into the cave, I don\u2019t see any worthwhile items... surely it\u2019s not going to end with just Mice all the way to the end?\u2019</p><br/><p> Bit by bit, anxiety reared his head.</p><br/><p> It was when Ark was having those thoughts, that all of a sudden, with a\u00a0<em>thud</em>sound, the Mice that had been running at him crazily, abruptly flinched and ran, scattering left and right.</p><br/><p> \u2018Huh? What\u2019s this?\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark, who had been turning his head back and forth with an incredulous look, took in a sudden breath. From within the darkness, on the other side of where the Mice had fled, were a pair of red orbs.</p><br/><p> \u201cW-What is this bastard?\u201d</p><br/><p> The slowly approaching red orbs took form.</p><br/><p> Surprisingly, the orbs were the eyes of a Mouse.</p><br/><p> It wasn\u2019t a Mouse the likes of which Ark had faced until now. It was easily 10 times bigger than a Wolf \u2014 a massive Mouse monster. Enraged that some bastard had intruded, it ROARED and the entire cave shook.</p><br/><p> This terrible\u00a0<em>fear</em>!</p><br/><p> Ark\u2019s legs trembled and the strength went right out of him.</p><br/><p> Terrified, the Wolves tucked their tails and fled out of the cave.</p><br/><p> \u201cOh my god. No way, this bastard....\u201d</p><br/><p> Was the identity of the demon written of on the parchment this monster?</p><br/><p> It was highly likely.</p><br/><p> He had written that he\u2019d gotten a fatal wound in the cave. And the place where he had died hadn\u2019t been far from the entrance. For he who had traveled a distance after receiving a command from an Aristocrat, to have been unable to escape the cave with a fatal wound... that had been an inconsistency.</p><br/><p> \u2018He went all the way into the cave and met this demon. Then, while inflicted with a fatal wound, he ran away only to be attacked by a swarm of Mice, and he collapsed. That\u2019s what happened.\u2019</p><br/><p> If he thought like that, there were no inconsistencies. And it was highly likely that Ark would be punished with the same fate.</p><br/><p> The dread Ark felt when he had first met a Wolf was incomparable to the horror that drowned him now. At this critical moment, the contents of the quest were updated.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><div></div><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>- Boss monster \u2018Black Bear Mouse\u2019 has appeared.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> \u00a0</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0 <ul><li>The quest has been updated.

That was probably because at his current level, that was impossible. Moreover, just relaying the information about the demon Mouse had a difficulty level of F.</p><br/><p> To be sure, he saw a large possibility that the pitch black Mouse swarm was going out of the cave to avoid the demon Mouse. All of the possible situations were the worst, but Ark\u2019s eyes were actually glowing instead.</p><br/><p> \u2018Then that means this Mouse is an lump of experience and items!\u2019</p><br/><p> His greed exceeded his horror.</p><br/><p> An avaricious light sparkled in Ark\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p> A boss monster was no different from a treasure chest that gave all adventurers the honor of finding it!</p><br/><p> It was the first boss monster he\u2019d met.

However, in the next moment, his expression changed to one of embarrassment. He had swung the rusted sword with all his strength, but the demon Mouse didn\u2019t even register the blow.</p><br/><p> The thick leather covering the body had deflected the sword.</p><br/><p> *Squeek, kiayaa!*</p><br/><p> The huge Mouse lashed out with its front paw.</p><br/><p> When he blocked it with his sword, his palm throbbed from the impact.</p><br/><p> \u2018Oh my god, I blocked it with my sword but my stamina was still cut!\u2019</p><br/><p> A full bite from a Wolf cut his health by 30 points. Even though he\u2019d blocked the attack from the demon Mouse, 30 health had been cut away. If he was really hit, he wouldn\u2019t be able to endure two or three hits.</p><br/><p> \u201cDamn it, Spirit of the Cat!\u201d</p><br/><p> Nyaaaaaaaaaaa!</p><br/><p> When Ark used this as the last measure, the regular Mice were paralyzed. Shortly after, the demon Mouse roared and the Mice quickly regained consciousness.</p><br/><p> \u2018Oh my god, Spirit of the Cat doesn\u2019t work!\u2019</p><br/><p> Ark completely lost his previous ambition and turned his body away. In that moment, the Mouse swarm attacked him from all directions. While Ark was struggling in the Mouse swarm, a heavy blow connected with his back and pain exploded.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>- You have been stunned. All movements are blocked for five seconds.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> Immediately, his health was cut by 50 and his consciousness became fuzzy. Before his consciousness could return, he was hit by another attack. At last his health reached rock bottom, and Ark collapsed to the floor.</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p> \u201cDamn it!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark fumed and went inside the bar.</p><br/><p> After the demon Mouse\u2019s attacks, Ark lost his life. When he opened his eyes, he was back at the Quartermaster at the entrance of Harun village. However, the quest had updated, he had to stop by the tavern to give necessary reports.</p><br/><p> \u201cOh! Ark, you have returned safe and sound!\u201d</p><br/><p> As per usual, Kraydon greeted Ark gladly.</p><br/><p> Ark immediately took a look around and shut his mouth before giving his report.</p><br/><p> Inside the tavern, some users were sitting and eyeing them. Because Ark did not want anyone else to know about the existence of the cave, he called Kraydon out to the warehouse.</p><br/><p> Kraydon's face turned pale after Ark had told him what he had encountered inside the cave.</p><br/><p> \"The cave has been inhabited by a terrifying monster.\"</p><br/><p> \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, this is no time to be standing around like this. Before the bastard comes and brings danger to the village, we have to tell Lord the truth. I\u2019ll also ask him to send soldiers at once, to deal with the bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cAh, you can\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark shouted indignantly.</p><br/><p> \u201cWhat? Why not? What do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cUm... Well, you know...\u201d</p><br/><p> \u2018Damn, I shouldn\u2019t have talked about it.\u2019</p><br/><p> If the Lord dispatched Soldiers, then of course the users would also come to know of it.</p><br/><p> If that happened, Ark will no longer have monopoly over the treasures of the cave. Soldiers might take it, or give onlooking players an opportunity to take it.\u00a0</p><br/><p> That would make Ark feel jealous to death.</p><br/><p> \u2018That can\u2019t happen, absolutely not! The cave is mine. Up until now, how much time have I invested in order to obtain treasures inside the cave? Now there\u2019s one demon Mouse to kill, they can\u2019t just come waltzing in at the last moment!\u2019</p><br/><p> However, he could not say his thoughts out loud.</p><br/><p> After contemplating on what to do, Ark put his hopes on his intimacy with Kraydon and spoke.</p><br/><p> \u201cThis is a job you requested of me. You believed in me and entrusted it to me, right? To repay your trust, I want to solve this with my own hands. So please give me a little more time. I will certainly repay your trust in me.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes, I didn\u2019t know you cared that much about me. Of course, I believe in you. However, this isn\u2019t a matter I can decide on by myself. The safety of the whole village is hanging on this. Even if we barely miss the timing, everything could become dangerous. I\u2019m saying this can\u2019t wait until you\u2019ve become a worthy warrior.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019m begging you. Give me a chance to restore my honor.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p> Ark said it with an imploring light in his eyes.</p><br/><p> Truthfully, he wasn\u2019t the type of person to say those apologetic words to anyone. However, he was facing an NPC. Even though he acted almost exactly like a human, in the end he was still a computer-generated artificial intelligence. There was no reason for his pride to turn sour over saying such sorry words to an AI.</p><br/><p> As Ark begged pathetically, Kraydon deliberated with an uncomfortable look.</p><br/><p> \u201cFor you of all people to say such things, I can\u2019t stay stubborn. That this village is peaceful right now is all thanks to you, after all. Alright, then let\u2019s do it like this. For now I\u2019ll give you ten days. If I don\u2019t hear from you after that, I\u2019ll ask Lord Jackson for help. Will that do?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cTen days.....\u201d</p><br/><p> One day in real life was three in the game.</p><br/><p> So to speak, one week was three days in real life.</p><br/><p> The time it had taken to clear the cave until now was already precious. Furthermore, to play the game he couldn\u2019t give up his job, so even if he reduced his sleeping time to the maximum, the time he had left was a little more than a day.</p><br/><p> And Kraydon was wearing an resolute expression that said he couldn\u2019t make anymore exceptions. In the end, Ark nodded.</p><br/><p> Though it was too much to ask... There was nothing he could do but to try.</p><br/><p> \u201cI understand. Let\u2019s do that to put the village\u2019s safety first.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cI\u2019m glad you understand. Then I\u2019ll believe and entrust this to you.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0 <ul><li>The quest has been updated. The mysterious organism living within the cave: After hearing about the demon Mouse in the hidden cave, Kraydon has asked you to defeat the demon Mouse. Stipulation, this request has a time limit of ten days. If you do not clear the demon Mouse within this time, Kraydon will tell the truth to the Lord, and the request will be automatically cancelled. Level of difficulty: +F</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> As he\u2019d anticipated, the quest that involved personally slaying the demon Mouse had a \u2018+\u2019 attached to the difficulty level. \u2018+\u2019 indicated an elite quest, something that had to be completed with a party.</p><br/><p> F difficulty level was roughly for level 15 and below. That meant that this was a request that could be resolved with a party of users at level 15.</p><br/><p> However, when it came to parties now, Ark was the type of person to grind his teeth.</p><br/><p> \u2018There\u2019s no way I\u2019m doing it with a party!\u2019</p><br/><p> To be honest, it was a matter Ark had thought about often. The quest\u2019s contents were to deal with the demon Mouse, but at his level of 8, it was impossible.</p><br/><p> \u2018A week from now. I have to somehow secretly go into the demon Mouse\u2019s cave and take the treasure.\u2019</p><br/><p> As long as he was able to get the treasure, whatever happened to the demon Mouse was none of his concern.</p><br/><p> As Ark was thinking that, he turned to leave. The closely watching Kraydon abruptly asked.</p><br/><p> \u201cAfter a closer look, it seems like you don\u2019t have many supplies left.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes, as I spent time on the cave investigation, before I knew it....\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark replied with the most pitiful expression on his face. He thought he might be able to receive some free wheat breads. If he could save even 1 silver, he could put on a pitiful expression any day. Then, after staring blankly at Ark\u2019s face, Kraydon opened his mouth again.</p><br/><p> \u201cDo you have any thoughts of learning how to cook?\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cCooking?\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark questioned with an expression that said he didn\u2019t follow.</p><br/><p> \u201cActually, at one time I went traveling to a lot of places like you. The thing that troubled me the most was the problem of food. However, even if you learn how to cook, if you don\u2019t have the ingredients, isn\u2019t that just useless? So in order to solve that problem, I started learning how to cook in a completely different way. It\u2019s a cooking method that doesn\u2019t cost money, and there\u2019s no need to carry around ingredients.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cDoes such a cooking method exist?\u201d</p><br/><p> It was really a sound that made his ears perk up.</p><br/><p> \u201cAlright, until now I haven\u2019t found any worthy travelers, so I haven\u2019t passed this down to anyone yet. If it\u2019s you, who has unfailingly helped me this long with all your heart, it\u2019s a different matter. You always carried an ample supply of bread with you, so I thought you wouldn\u2019t need this.... if you want it, I\u2019ll teach it to you.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u201cYes, please!\u201d</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0 <ul><li>You have learned a new skill. Survival Cooking (Special, Beginner, Passive): The owner of the bar in Harun, Kraydon, created this original method of cooking. If you learn this skill, you can use almost every type of food found in nature as ingredients to make food. However, the result cannot be predicted. Therefore, to find out the effects of the food, you may have to put your life on the line....</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> \u00a0</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0 <ul><li>Ingredient Foraging (Beginner, Passive): You can gather a variety of food ingredients from nature.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> \u2018Put your life on the line to discover the effect of food?\u2019</p><br/><p> The last part was troubling, but he was fairly satisfied with the skill. He could use all the ingredients he could find in nature to make food. Then if he just learned several recipes, he could endure for several days in remote places like the cave even without wheat bread.</p><br/><p> Indeed, Survival Cooking had a name that suited it perfectly. For him to learn such a skill for free... NPCs had to be treated with friendliness after all.</p><br/><p> And on top of that Kraydon pulled out a large pot and handed it to him.</p><br/><p> \u201cIf you\u2019re to do Survival Cooking, you\u2019re going to need this too.\u201d</p><br/><p> \u00a0</p><table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"3\"><tbody><tr><td>\u00a0 <br/><p>- You have acquired an iron pot for Survival Cooking.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><br/><p> \u201cThank you!\u201d</p><br/><p> Ark bowed and slipped out of the bar.</p><br/><p> [T/N: In Korea, it is customary to bow to your elders when you see them and leave them.]</p><br/><p> Because there was a schedule, he didn\u2019t have a moment to waste. Ark immediately went to the general store and sold off all the Wolf leathers he had saved. Then he swallowed his tears and bought one recovery potion.</p><br/><p> Until now, his spirit had somehow endured, but with the demon Mouse, he couldn\u2019t spare money in facing it. This time, with his death he had lost 6 stats. Though he would probably be able to restore his stats killing the Mice in the cave, he didn\u2019t have the time to waste on this again.</p><br/><p> The price for a health potion that restores 100 life was a staggering 5 gold. Thanks to his intimacy, he only had to pay 3 gold and 50 silvers. The fortune he had accumulated bit by bit like a diligent ant was one fifth gone.</p><br/><p> \u2018If I add the equipment repair fee to this....\u2019</p><br/><p> Automatically, he puffed out a sigh. However, Ark was resolute.</p><br/><p> This was an investment. If he could get just one decent treasure from within the cave, even that would compensate for everything. For the last time, Ark had his rusted sword and leather clothes repaired at the blacksmith and set off for the cave again.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Eyes widening, he looked up at the bird, feeling like he was about to go insane.... The truth was that this bird actually had two names. In the Blood Stream Sect, it was called a bloodspirit heron, but in the Spirit Stream Sect, it was known as an irispetal ibis.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn't sure which name to call it. That was especially true considering that killing intent was surging on both sides of him. He could almost feel the tears welling up in his eyes. How he hated that bird....</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you, bird!\u201d he thought. \u201cWhy? Why why why did you have to show up here!?!?\u201d Trembling, he looked at Song Junwan on his left, and Hou Xiaomei on his right. Both of them were staring at him with looks of anticipation on their faces. He could well imagine that whoever he sided with, the other would be deeply and profoundly grieved.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun gritted his teeth and prepared to make up a new name. However, that was when Song Junwan suddenly said, \u201cNightcrypt, don\u2019t you dare try to pull a fast one by making up a new name!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro Xiaochun,\u201d Hou Xiaomei chimed in, \u201cyou can\u2019t say you don\u2019t recognize it. I know you\u2019ve seen those birds in the Spirit Stream Sect before!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a rare occasion: Hou Xiaomei and Song Junwan were siding with each other as they stared at Bai Xiaochun, deep emotions flickering in their eyes....</p><br/><p>\u201cI... I....\u201d Sweat dripped down Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face. By this point, he was in a state of complete despair. Back when they\u2019d brought him medicine, he\u2019d managed to pull a fast one, but as of this moment, that didn\u2019t seem possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I do...?\u201d he thought, his eyes glistening with tears. Based on how Song Junwan and Hou Xiaomei were pushing him, it was obvious that they didn\u2019t care at all what the bird was called, they just wanted him to choose between the two of them.</p><br/><p>Eyes bloodshot, he pointed up at the bird and howled, \u201cFine! I\u2019ll tell you. That bird is a... it\u2019s a....\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he bit down on his tongue, and then unleashed his cultivation base power, allowing it to run wild within him. As it burst into his qi passageways, a sweet taste filled his mouth, and then he spat out a mouthful of blood. Then his vision started going dark, and he began to lapse into unconsciousness.</p><br/><p>In the last moment before he passed out, he sighed deeply.</p><br/><p>Song Junwan and Hou Xiaomei were completely shocked. Not only did they see Bai Xiaochun coughing up blood, considering that they were holding him up by the arms, they could sense that his cultivation base was in chaos. Hou Xiaomei looked like she was about to cry as she carried Bai Xiaochun back into the immortal's cave. As for Song Junwan, she pulled out a huge collection of spirit medicines, which she began to push into his mouth.</p><br/><p>Some distance away on the two mountain peaks, the Song Clan patriarch and Patriarch Ironwood watched the scene play out, their eyes flickering with sympathy.</p><br/><p>The Song Clan patriarch sighed and said, \u201cDid the little brat really think getting involved with women could be so simple? I learned the truth of it years ago. With the flick of a sleeve, I detached myself from all impurities.\u201d</p><br/><p>In rare fashion, Patriarch Ironwood seemed to completely agree with him. Nodding, he said, \u201cLove is tribulation. Years ago, I severed such tribulation. Actually, now that I think about it, I can\u2019t even remember the faces of those old flames from years ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two old men exchanged a look. For the first time, they were in unison on something. Shaking their heads, they began to think back to their own pasts.</p><br/><p>A few days later, Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes and hurried over to the copper mirror hanging on the wall in his immortal's cave. When he looked into the mirror, he saw a gaunt, pale figure. As far as he was concerned, his world was now a world of darkness....</p><br/><p>After a long moment, he sighed and prepared to go outside and get some fresh air. He needed to calm down and think of an idea of how to deal with the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won\u2019t work for things to keep going on in this way. Their games are going to drive me to an early grave....\u201d Sighing, he pushed open the door of the immortal's cave, and was just about to step outside, when he suddenly went completely stiff.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two....\u201d Sweat broke out on his forehead as he realized that standing right outside the door of the immortal's cave were Song Junwan and Hou Xiaomei. It was impossible to say when they had arrived, but there they stood, right next to each other, smiling at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt, let\u2019s go for a walk!\u201d Song Junwan said, her eyes glittering charmingly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig bro Xiaochun, I won\u2019t make you name the birds this time.\u201d Hou Xiaomei said, blushing a bit and seeming more pure and charming than ever.</p><br/><p>And yet, the eyes of both women seemed to have inadvertently come to rest on his feet.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun felt all the hair on his body stand up on end. By now, he realized the truth. These two demonesses had become addicted to toying with him. Their games had reached the point where even which foot stepped out of his immortal's cave first was a point of contention....</p><br/><p>This was ridiculous. These two demonesses weren\u2019t even human.... Trembling visibly, he didn\u2019t dare to step outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm, so... fancy meeting you two here, huh? I\u2019m... I'm feeling a bit tired, I think I\u2019ll stay inside today....\u201d Forcing a smile onto his face, he began to back up. However, in that instant, a killing aura sprang up from Song Junwan, and as for Hou Xiaomei, her eyes began to fill with tears as she looked piteously at him.</p><br/><p>One seemed murderously angry, the other, wronged and maligned....</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was on the verge of going mad. He was in such pain that he suddenly unleashed all of the spiritual power that he had carefully built up inside of himself. The chaotic power swept through him, causing blood to spray out of his mouth. Yet again, his vision went dark, and he collapsed.</p><br/><p>Before losing consciousness, he didn\u2019t sigh, but tears filled his eyes.</p><br/><p>Two days later in the middle of the night, Bai Xiaochun lay on the stone bed, and his eyes slowly opened. Then, he lay there staring up at the ceiling, tears flowing down his temples.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack when it was Hou Xiaomei by herself, it was so great. She believed anything I said. But now....</p><br/><p>\u201cBack when it was Song Junwan by herself, everything went my way. All I had to do was lose my temper a bit, and she would do anything I asked. But now....</p><br/><p>\u201cWith both of them together, it\u2019s simply terrifying....\u201d As he thought back to how wonderful it had been to simply deal with them alone, more tears flowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. If things keep going on this way, I'm gonna end up dead!!</p><br/><p>\u201cThey're going to toy with me all the way to the grave, torment me to death! I'm already on the verge of going crazy. First was the medicine, then that bird. Next, they\u2019re trying to decide which foot I walk with. Before you know it, they\u2019re going to be watching to see which eye opens first, or which hand twitches....</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t stay around here any longer. These two demonesses are too terrifying. I\u2019ve already coughed up blood twice. If this keep up, I could lose my poor little life.\u201d Trembling, face a mask of terror, he gritted his teeth!</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to join the war effort!!</p><br/><p>\u201cOn the battlefield, there\u2019s a chance I might get killed, but here, I\u2019ll definitely go crazy sooner or later....\u201d He suddenly felt more than ever like he truly wanted to join the war. In fact, his heart had already left the Luochen Mountains; he had no desire whatsoever to stay.</p><br/><p>He rose to his feet, his expression that of unswerving determination. He seemed different than he had moments ago; his veins of steel were pulsing, and his eyes shone with intense light. He quickly packed his bags, then quietly opened the door of the immortal's cave. Sending his divine sense out first, he looked around the area.</p><br/><p>It was currently the middle of the night, and the moon was obscured by the clouds. Everything was pitch black, and silent except for the sounds of various night creatures and birds.</p><br/><p>He looked around vigilantly to make sure that Song Junwan and Hou Xiaomei weren\u2019t lying in wait. Then, he burst into motion, drawing upon all the speed he could muster, even using his wings. He became a beam of light that shot at top speed toward the two mountain peaks occupied by the Song Clan patriarch and Patriarch Ironwood.</p><br/><p>Fearful of attracting the attention of Song Junwan and Hou Xiaomei, he moved as fast as he could without actually making any noise in the process. Soon, he reached the two mountains, where he stopped in place and took a deep breath. His eye shone with determination, and his expression was that of ultimate decisiveness. He suddenly seemed like a combination of both Bai Xiaochun and Nightcrypt, heroic, extraordinary, and at the same time, formidable and ruthless!</p><br/><p>He seemed taller than before as he strode forward to the base of the twin peaks. Eyes shining with cold ferocity, he clasped hands and bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am legacy echelon disciple Bai Xiaochun of the Spirit Stream Sect, and blood master Nightcrypt of the Blood Stream Sect. Greetings, Patriarchs!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Song Clan patriarch and Patriarch Ironwood slowly opened their eyes, and looked down in surprise at Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>A murderous aura sprang up around Bai Xiaochun as he said, \u201cStepfather, Patriarch, as the blood master of Middle Peak, and as a legacy echelon cultivator of the Spirit Stream Sect, I must perform meritorious services! I must go to the battlefield to face the enemy!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Song Clan patriarch and Patriarch Ironwood had strange expressions on their faces. After a moment, the Song Clan patriarch said, \u201cI thought you hadn\u2019t recovered yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStepfather, a few injures are like nothing when compared to the greater good of both sects!\u201d He smiled broadly, as if he didn\u2019t care at all about his injuries. At the same time, the determination in his eyes grew more intense. \u201cWhat cultivator can go through life without being injured? The important thing is the value of that injury. As for me, I was injured trying to protect our sects!\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked very heroic as he stood there uttering such words. Anyone who might have been able to see him would have been shocked. He seemed boundlessly righteous, a manly man as strong as iron and completely unafraid of dying!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe battlefield is a dangerous place, and death is a common thing there. Aren\u2019t you afraid of that?\u201d Patriarch Ironwood asked softly.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun laughed heartily. Smacking his chest casually, he said, \u201cI\u2019m a true man! Blood will be spilled on the battlefield, that\u2019s true. But how could I simply stand by and watch my fellow sect members fighting in battle while I relax in comfort? That... is not Bai Xiaochun\u2019s way of doing things, and it is definitely not Nightcrypt\u2019s style!</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarchs, there\u2019s no need for further discussion. I... I definitely want to join the war effort!!\u201d His sonorous words were spoken with decisiveness that could sever nails and chop iron.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well,\u201d the Song Clan patriarch said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly how a son of mine should act.\u201d He and Patriarch Ironwood exchanged a glance, then nodded. \u201cTomorrow morning, you can take this teleportation medallion to the teleportation portal. It will take you to our garrison in the Profound Stream Sect region!\u201d Laughing heartily, the Song Clan patriarch waved his hand, sending a command medallion flying toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun grabbed the medallion and flashed a carefree smile.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat's the point in waiting until tomorrow? My heart burns with the desire to kill the enemy! I can\u2019t sleep like that! I\u2019ll head to the teleportation portal immediately, and wade directly into battle. The time has come to put my life on the line for the sects!\u201d Flicking his sleeve, he transformed into a beam of light that shot directly toward the teleportation portal. Moments later, the light of teleportation shot up into the sky, illuminating the darkness of night. A single figure could be seen in the light, his hair whipping around him, radiating determination, righteousness, and at the same time, bloody murder....</p><br/><p>The Song Clan patriarch and Patriarch Ironwood laughed and looked at each other. Seeing the smiles on each other\u2019s faces, they realized at some point, they had come to admire each other a bit.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

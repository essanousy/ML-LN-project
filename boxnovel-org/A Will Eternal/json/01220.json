If he didn\u2019t understand Bai Xiaochun, then nobody did, but in his moment of excitement, he had momentarily forgotten what type of person he was dealing with. As soon as he saw Bai Xiaochun\u2019s visible excitement regarding the subject of names, he got a very bad premonition.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one to suddenly have a bad feeling. The Grand Heavenmaster sucked in a breath, and Patriarch Spirit Stream\u2019s eyes widened in shock. And it almost wasn\u2019t necessary to mention Big Fatty Zhang, Xu Baocai and Master God-Diviner.</p><br/><p>Strange expressions appeared on the faces of all present. Even the most simple-minded person wouldn\u2019t need to spend much thought to come to the conclusion that Bai Xiaochun\u2026 would come up with some very unusual names.</p><br/><p>Most nervous of all was the Giant Ghost King, who, upon realizing that his grandson might live his entire life with a very unpleasant name, interjected, \u201cI came up with some names, too. I\u2019ll go first--\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJust hold on, father-in-law!\u201d Bai Xiaochun interrupted with a glare; there was no way he would let anyone steal the limelight when it came to revealing some good names.</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghost King grimaced and sighed, secretly cursing Li Qinghou for what he had instigated. As for Li Qinghou, he was really starting to get nervous, and was just about to say something when Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat loudly and started talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cI've picked a very impressive name for my son. Majestic even. He will be named\u2026 Bai Dada!!\u201d <span id=\"footnote-ref-9d44\">[1]</span> By this point, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were shining brightly. He had thought of many names over the past few days, but none of them had seemed impressive enough. But this name made him feel like he had been struck by lightning, and left him shivering with enthusiasm.</p><br/><p>He was actually convinced that this was one of the best names he had ever heard in his life. In fact, in all creation, there were only two names which could possibly match up to it!</p><br/><p>One was his own name, and the other was his daughter\u2019s.</p><br/><p>As soon as he said the name, gasps could be heard. Big Fatty Zhang nearly started laughing, but ended up in a choking fit.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked over at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Eldest Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Fatty Zhang cleared his throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 nothing!\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a great name. Really! It even has the\u00a0da\u00a0character like my name. I guess we're connected by destiny!\u201d <span id=\"footnote-ref-98c2\">[2]</span></p><br/><p>Feeling very pleased, Bai Xiaochun looked over at Master God-Diviner, who was staring at him blankly. After a few moments passed, Master God-Diviner\u2019s expression turned somber, and he began to make some calculations with his fingers, as though he were performing a divination.</p><br/><p>Pleased with how seriously Master God-Diviner was taking the situation, Bai Xiaochun turned to look at Xu Baocai.</p><br/><p>Looking very excited, Xu Baocai said, \u201cIt\u2019s the type of name\u2026 that resounds like heavenly thunder, that sounds like the heavens singing in my ears! It\u2019s especially appropriate considering that the grand prince\u2019s birth was accompanied by signs and portents in heaven and earth! Only our beloved prince could qualify to bear such a name, a name personally devised by you, Your Majesty!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Xu Baocai didn\u2019t seem to care at all that everyone else was likely despising him for his little speech.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was very happy. However, Li Qinghou, the Grand Heavenmaster, Patriarch Spirit Stream, and the other members of the senior generation all seemed completely taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, this name\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaochun, why don\u2019t you pick another name?\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of them were trying to be a bit discreet, but the Giant Ghost King was not.</p><br/><p>\u201cHell no!\u201d he shouted. \u201cThere\u2019s no way you\u2019re naming my grandson Bai Dada!! Are you kidding me? What kind of name is that?! If you\u2019re going to name him that, what are you going to name your daughter? Bai Xiaoxiao?!\u201d <span id=\"footnote-ref-c003\">[3]</span></p><br/><p>Eyes sparkling, Bai Xiaochun laughed. Feeling prouder of himself than ever, he nodded vigorously.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really understand me well, father-in-law. You hit the nail on the head. My daughter\u2019s name will be Bai Xiaoxiao. What do you think? Together, Bai Dada and Bai Xiaoxiao will be unparalleled under heaven!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, everyone began to object. However, despite the fact that Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t generally a stubborn person, he wouldn\u2019t budge an inch when it came to the names. No matter what people said, he refused to change them.</p><br/><p>Eventually, people began to sigh in defeat. And the Giant Ghost King was nearly on the verge of tears, and felt like he might explode at any moment. It actually made Bai Xiaochun feel a bit bad.</p><br/><p>After hemming and hawing for quite a while,he said, \u201cAlright, listen. We can\u2019t change\u00a0Bai. And we can\u2019t change\u00a0Da. But since you\u2019re all making the same argument, I guess we can change the third character. Come one, father-in-law, you\u2019re a bit old to be getting all worked up like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>At long last, the Giant Ghost King began to calm down. He stood there thoughtfully for a moment, his eyes bloodshot, until he finally gritted his teeth and suggested a new third character for the name!</p><br/><p>\u201cLet's change the final character to\u00a0bao!\u201d <span id=\"footnote-ref-21a9\">[4]</span></p><br/><p>\u201cBai Dabao?\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s lips twitched slightly. As for the rest of the crowd, they once again looked stunned. Li Qinghou\u2019s jaw dropped as he looked over at the still fuming Giant Ghost King, and then back at Bai Xiaochun. Then he simply sighed. <span id=\"footnote-ref-bda2\">[5]</span></p><br/><p>The Grand Heavenmaster stood there quietly, and Big Fatty Zhang and the other members of the younger generation all exchanged awkward glances. To them\u2026 it almost seemed like Zhou Zimo and the Giant Ghost King weren\u2019t related at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d the Giant Ghost King said loftily. \u201cCall him Bai Dabao. It\u2019s a lot better than that\u00a0Bai Dada\u00a0that you came up with!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun scowled a bit, and then looked down at his son nestled in his arm. In the end, he didn\u2019t want to make the Giant Ghost King too angry, and therefore, had to agree.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, fine. It\u2019s settled. His name is Bai Dabao, and her name is Bai Xiaoxiao. And remember: this isn\u2019t my decision, it\u2019s <em>our</em> decision.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was worried that Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo might get angry with him, but was convinced that these names were really good. Thus, he dragged everyone else in with him on this decision.</p><br/><p>It was hard to say if Bai Dabao could understand what was going on at this young age, but as soon as he heard his name, he started crying.</p><br/><p>In contrast, Bai Xiaoxiao was laughing merrily, as though she were very pleased. It made her seem even more charming.</p><br/><p>After a bit of time, Dabao apparently got tired and went to sleep, prompting Bai Xiaochun to gingerly hand him over to the midwife. Xiaoxiao remained in high spirits, and continued to laugh and chuckle as Bai Xiaochun held her. She actually seemed very curious about all of the strangers around her.</p><br/><p>\u201cGirls are definitely better!\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought as he looked at his daughter, his heart swelling with love.\u00a0</p><br/><p>The following days were a time of jubilation in the Arch-Emperor Dynasty, especially Arch-Emperor City, which was decorated with lanterns and colored banners, and was constantly abuzz with excitement.</p><br/><p>Messages of congratulations came from the Saint-Emperor Dynasty and the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, and most of the celestials sent expensive gifts. Even Reverend Devourer and Prince Ur-Demon sent gifts, despite having been captured by Bai Xiaochun in the past.</p><br/><p>And there was little need to mention the people who owed favors to Bai Xiaochun, such as Sima Yunhua, Celestial Aged Spirit, Gu Tianjun, and Chen Su.</p><br/><p>The biggest gifts came from the Saint-Emperor and the Vile-Emperor. After all, they were all involved in a complicated relationship in which the three of them controlled everything under heaven. And thus, the gifts they gave were spectacular. The Vile-Emperor sent a large stone, and the Saint-Emperor sent two lotus leaves from the lotus flower in his heavenly pond!</p><br/><p>Those two leaves were incalculably valuable. After all, the only place in the Eternal Immortal Domains that had leaves like that was that heavenly pond. And the main lotus flower only had eighteen leaves to begin with.</p><br/><p>Nowadays, it only had fourteen left, and with two of them being given to Bai Xiaochun, it meant that the lotus flower now only had twelve leaves.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was quite moved by that gift. As for the stone given by the Vile-Emperor, most people would take it to be equally precious. After all, the gift he gave\u2026 was made from the flesh and blood of the sovereign in the sky over their heads!</p><br/><p>However, Bai Xiaochun knew that there was something suspicious about the Vile-Emperor\u2019s identity, and was therefore very careful about the gift he had sent. Because of that, he didn\u2019t let his children have any contact with it. And the killing intent which flickered in his eyes after receiving the gift took a long moment to fade.</p><br/><p>There were also numerous gifts of congratulations that came from within the Arch-Emperor Dynasty. However, only people who had actually known Bai Xiaochun back in the days of the Heavenspan Realm were able to meet with him personally.</p><br/><p>Both Chen Manyao and Xu Shan came together to offer gifts. Chen Manyao seemed quite at ease, but Xu Shan was more conflicted. However, she seemed resigned to reality. After giving a respectful smile, she and Chen Manyao turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn't say anything, and sighed deeply as he saw them begin to walk off.</p><br/><p>He was not the puny cultivator he had been years ago. He was the Arch-Emperor now, and although he had vast and nearly unlimited power, there were still certain things he couldn\u2019t do.</p><br/><p>Although these two women had been connected to him by destiny in the past, their lives had changed in profound ways. All it would have taken was one word, and he could have prevented the both of them from leaving, but that wasn't what he wanted.</p><br/><p>When you don\u2019t care for someone, it\u2019s easy to say anything you want to them. But after you care for them, there are some things that just can\u2019t be said. This was a truth Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t understand in the past, but understood fully now.</p><br/><p>After escorting Xu Shan and Chen Manyao away, he returned to the palace hall, and was about to go check on Dabao and Xiaoxiao when he heard a crafty and shrill voice coming from behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey little Xiaochun. Lord Turtle is back. Get me some good food and drink, otherwise I\u2019ll stamp your son\u2019s face with a turtle mark!\u201d</p><div id=\"footnote-9d44\"><br/><p>1. The character\u00a0da\u00a0means\u00a0big\u00a0or\u00a0grand.

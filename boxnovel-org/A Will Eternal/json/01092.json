It was a level of power that could very well destroy the Eternal Immortal Domains as a whole.</p><br/><p>And although they were actually illusory, to Prince Ur-Demon and Reverend Devourer, they seemed very real.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this really the twentieth level?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis must be the fiftieth or eightieth level. Or maybe the hundredth!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is this happening? This level of difficulty is ridiculous!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ironically, Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a was taking things even worse than Prince Ur-Demon and Reverend Devourer.</p><br/><p>Those two had never been specifically targeted by Bai Xiaochun, whereas Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a had. His confidence had been crushed earlier, and that was not something that could be recovered from easily. And thus, the situation was even more terrifying for him.</p><br/><p>The only comfort he had was that this time\u2026 he had someone to accompany him in misery\u2026.</p><br/><p>In their dismay, they fled. Their goal was not to fully escape, but to wait for the teleportation function to activate. After all, despite being mentally crushed by the increase in difficulty in the level, they weren\u2019t afraid of dying. Everyone knew that in this trial by fire, death wasn\u2019t a possibility.</p><br/><p>The worst outcome was failure and injury.</p><br/><p>And these celestials were decisive people by nature. Therefore, they immediately took to flight, giving up on any hope of possibly winning. Besides, running away might help them to avoid some level of injury. As they fled, the minotaur monsters swarmed them.</p><br/><p>However, not even Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a could ever have guessed that the current situation was like nothing compared to the nightmare which was to come\u2026.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was furious at how everything had played out, and furious at Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a for figuring out a better way to cheat than him\u2026. He was also worried about the implications of dealing with a celestial who could find loopholes within the damaged fan\u2019s systems. Therefore, he decided that he absolutely, positively could not allow him to pass the level.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad you can\u2019t kill people. I guess the best thing to do is trap him in there!\u201d With every moment that passed, he became more convinced that this was the best thing to do. Meanwhile, inside the level, the light of teleportation had begun to build up, causing the three celestials\u2019 eyes to brighten.</p><br/><p>In sharp contrast, Bai Xiaochun was not happy at all. Eyes glittering, he called upon his connection to the damaged fan to limit the teleportation function. Even as Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a, Reverend Devourer and Prince Ur-Demon began to fade away\u2026.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds echoed out, and they became clear again. Then, the light of teleportation vanished!</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!?!\u201d Gasping, they began to dodge the attacking minotaurs, intense unease rising up in their hearts. They were now more nervous than they had been when they first saw the 1,000 minotaur monsters.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was very pleased with the level of control he had. Still not completely sure of what he could do, he began to carefully push harder to see what was possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cLock down the teleportation power. Lock down the teleportation power!!\u201d His thoughts were like orders to the fan. Immediately, ripples filled the twentieth level, to the point where Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a, Reverend Devourer and Prince Ur-Demon all noticed.</p><br/><p>To their shock, rumbling sounds could be heard, and although it was impossible for the three celestials to understand why it was happening, all teleportation power in the twentieth level\u2026 was completely locked down!</p><br/><p>Although it wasn\u2019t permanent, until the spirit automaton awoke, there was no way that Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a, Reverend Devourer and Prince Ur-Demon would be able to leave the twentieth level!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou wanted to challenge this level, right? Well fine then. You can challenge it day and night!\u201d Gritting his teeth, Bai Xiaochun prepared to retract his divine sense, but then stopped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, that\u2019s not quite enough. I want to make sure that even when the spirit automaton wakes up and frees them, those three villains are too worn out to attempt any more challenges.\u201d After some thought, he pulled out a handful of\u2026 Aphrodisiac Pills.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt's too bad I don\u2019t have many Aphrodisiac Pills left, otherwise I would use some more. Ah, whatever. This should be enough. I refuse to believe that when the dust settles, they\u2019ll have the energy to do anything else!\u201d Snorting coldly, he crushed the pills and sent the dust flying over to the minotaur monsters\u2026.</p><br/><p>As the powder spread out\u2026 Bai Xiaochun retracted his divine sense. Although he wasn\u2019t interested in watching the results, he couldn\u2019t help but savor the knowledge of what a bitter place the twentieth level would shortly become\u2026.</p><br/><p>Although Bai Xiaochun wasn't watching, Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a, Reverend Devourer and Prince Ur-Demon were right there. After a brief moment, the minotaur monsters suddenly began to charge them with greater fervor.</p><br/><p>Their eyes were bright red, and their howling pants caused the celestials\u2019 scalps to tingle.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the minotaur monsters?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy\u2026 why do I have such a bad feeling about this!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, have they gone crazy or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>To the shock of the celestials, even more bizarre things began to happen to the minotaur monsters. They began to grow larger, with blue veins bulging out all over their bodies. As this happened, their howls reached the point that the celestials were trembling violently in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!!\u201d</p><br/><p>From he way the minotaur monsters looked at them, it seemed that they were the most beautiful and enticing things in all creation. Soon, the minotaur monsters began to fight amongst themselves in madness to get to the front of the group.</p><br/><p>As for what happened after that, the story was never publicly revealed\u2026.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t pay much more attention to the twentieth level. He occasionally sent some divine sense over to check on it quickly, and would usually shiver and look away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t blame me. Those three bastards took it upon themselves to mess with me. And they even tried to compete in cheating!\u201d Clearing his throat, he chose to focus his energy on the other cultivators. Over the following days, he got much pleasure from preventing them from advancing through any more levels. Soon, everyone was sighing.</p><br/><p>Half a month passed by in a flash. By now, more than half of the total allotted time had passed. Eventually, people realized that Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a, Reverend Devourer and Prince Ur-Demon had gone missing, to the shock of everyone, and the unease of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty cultivators.</p><br/><p>Even Gu Tianjun and Sima Yunhua had no idea what was going on, and felt the need to be more on guard than ever.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun heard everyone whispering about the missing celestials, he started to feel a bit guilty. For a moment, he considered going to check on the twentieth level, but in the end, decided it wasn\u2019t a good idea.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really am just too kindhearted. What would happen if I felt bad and then let them out\u2026? That wouldn\u2019t be good\u2026.\u201d Sighing, he once again began to ponder why he had this big weakness\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

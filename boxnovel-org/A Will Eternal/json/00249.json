That blood-colored key is actually chasing Nightcrypt?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis... this....\u201d Although people were shocked, it didn\u2019t take long before them to react, and they began to speed toward Bai Xiaochun to start fighting for the key.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, up in midair, Xuemei and Song Junwan saw what was happening. Song Junwan looked angry; she had seen what had happened with Bai Xiaochun earlier, and felt it was a true pity that he had passed up the first key. Now here he was flying along while the key chased him, refusing to grab it. Song Junwan was furious.</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt!\u201d she yelled. \u201cThe key is right behind you! Take it immediately! Everybody else, protect Nightcrypt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun hesitated for a moment, but when he considered that if he wanted to become a grand elder eventually, he would need Song Junwan\u2019s recommendation, and that she had just openly given him an order, he gritted his teeth, stopped in place and reached out to solemnly grab the key.</p><br/><p>In that instant, the second blood-colored key suddenly erupted with dazzling light and shot into his hand. For some reason, Bai Xiaochun was certain that, as it did, he heard something like a cry of joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome help me!\u201d he cried. There was no time to think. He immediately began to back up as Song Junwan\u2019s other Dharma protectors arrived to intercept the enemy. A moment later, magical combat erupted all around him, causing resounding booming sounds to shake heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>Not everyone was present; in fact, not even ten people were here. However, magical items were unleashed, and terrifying fluctuations spread out. It was in that moment, that someone shouted out in alarm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a second, why is the blood-colored light so faint?!?!\u201d The person to shout out was one of Xuemei\u2019s Dharma protectors, and currently, his face was a mask of incredulity as he stared at Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>As his voice echoed out, everyone else looked over, and soon, all of their minds were reeling.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had actually noticed what was happening before anyone else. As soon as his fingers closed around the blood-colored key, the light that had been bursting out of it began to flow into his mouth. Once inside of him, it surged through his body, causing his Undying Heavenly King to operate at full function.</p><br/><p>The blood-colored light emanating out from the key immediately began to grow dim.... It almost looked to everyone else as if Bai Xiaochun were eating the key....</p><br/><p>The effect was so pronounced that everyone could clearly sense the key growing weak....</p><br/><p>\u201cHe... he\u2019s actually drawing on the power of the key?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not just drawing on some of its power, he\u2019s obviously eating it! Nightcrypt, stop that immediately!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! I\u2019ve never heard of anybody doing such a thing. If... if he completely eats it, will its teleportation powers still work?\u201d People were so taken aback all they could do was stare in shock.</p><br/><p>Even Song Junwan and Xuemei, who were still locked in combat in midair, were staring at the blood-colored light fading away. Within the space of a few breaths of time, the light was completely gone.</p><br/><p>What was left in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand... didn't look anything like a key anymore.... Even as everyone stared at Bai Xiaochun, his aura surged, and the power of the Undying Heavenly King exploded ferociously inside of him. He was about to try to explain, but when he opened his mouth, a burp echoed out loud and clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cI... <em>burp</em>... I didn\u2019t... <em>burp</em>... do it on purpose... <em>burp</em>....\u201d Bai Xiaochun was so scared he was about to cry. Clasping his hands over his mouth, he looked around at the incredulous stares being leveled at him, which rapidly began to fill with killing intent. More nervous than ever, he began to back up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe actually ate that key!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe key\u2019s gone! That\u2019s one spot out of seven... gone! Kill Nightcrypt! This is his fault!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him! The first and second keys both showed up near him. If the third one does the same and he eats that too, we\u2019ll lose another spot!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat if he eats all the keys? If that happens... we\u2019ll all be losers....\u201d As their minds spun with the thought of what could happen, they howled and charged toward Bai Xiaochun. As for Song Junwan\u2019s Dharma protectors, they hesitated for a moment, but then refrained from interfering. The scene which had just played out was simply too bizarre.</p><br/><p>Another of Xuemei\u2019s Dharma protectors was a bit further off in the distance. After watching the depressing scene play out, and then hearing everyone crying out, his own anger surged, and he shot after Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>By now, eight or nine people were chasing him, the weakest of them being in the late Foundation Establishment stage, with more than one being in the great circle. Most shocking of all was that several of them were clutching powerful magical treasures. Bai Xiaochun was trembling in fear, but thankfully, was fast enough to evade them as he fled for his life.</p><br/><p>Before Song Junwan and Xuemei could even react, a whole group was after Bai Xiaochun. They were completely taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can eat those keys?\u201d Song Junwan murmured. Xuemei was equally stunned.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun flew through the Blood Wasteland at top speed. Some among the pursuers were faster than the others, but all were slower than Bai Xiaochun, and before long, there was quite a distance between chaser and chased.</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt, you will die beyond the shadow of a doubt this day!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, I can\u2019t believe you completely absorbed that key! Y-y-you....\u201d</p><br/><p>Various divine abilities and magical techniques were unleashed, leaving Bai Xiaochun so frightened he felt like his scalp would explode from terror. He felt completely wronged, and even more so, angered. He almost thought about turning around and fighting, but there were just too many opponents, all of them with higher cultivation bases than him, and many with powerful magical treasures. Although Xiao Qing wasn\u2019t among their number, Bai Xiaochun had the feeling he might show up at any moment, and thus devoted himself fully to fleeing.</p><br/><p>Before long, the third and fourth hours had passed, and the fifth hour was approaching....</p><br/><p>In that very instant, the group of pursuers were shocked to find that the third dot of red light had appeared directly above Bai Xiaochun\u2019s head. Even as he moved along, a blinding beam of blood-colored light shot up, which continued to float along with Bai Xiaochun as he flew along....</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly is going on here!?!? Dammit! Why is this happening?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe the third key... appeared right above him!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt, you will die this day!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xuemei\u2019s Dharma protectors were going mad. Were Jia Lie here, he would tearfully tell them that... this was nothing. Had they been by his side in the Endless World of Blood, they would have been driven to complete despair.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was really starting to get pissed off. Looking around at everyone, he gritted his teeth, reached up, and grabbed the third blood-colored key.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as massive amounts of blood-colored light poured into his mouth. Yet again, Bai Xiaochun seemed to be gobbling it up....</p><br/><p>\u201cHe... he ate another one!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are only seven keys, and he already ate two!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he keeps this up, then he\u2019ll end up eating all the keys. We have to kill him!\u201d Everyone was starting to get anxious. Song Junwan\u2019s Dharma protectors were starting to hesitate, unsure of whether they should help Nightcrypt, or try to kill him.</p><br/><p>Up in midair, Xuemei\u2019s eyes glittered with cold light, and she suddenly waved her right hand, causing the bracelet wrapped around her wrist to flash with blue light. Instantly, a blue beam shot out, and even as she was about to send it flying toward Bai Xiaochun, Song Junwan swished her sleeve, sending out a blast of power to block the way.</p><br/><p>Xuemei glared at Song Junwan. \u201cSong Junwan! Something weird is going on with him. I refuse to believe that you can\u2019t see it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Junwan refused to respond, and simply launched another attack.</p><br/><p>Xuemei grinned malevolently. Since she was being prevented from doing anything about Bai Xiaochun, she unleashed her full power upon Song Junwan. By this point, the two of them weren\u2019t simply feeling each other out, they were fighting with everything they had, including their secret weapons.</p><br/><p>At the same time, just as murderous auras were beginning to rise up, the mad absorption of the blood-colored light by Bai Xiaochun caused cracking sounds to ring out from inside of him. The Undying Heavenly King was operating at full speed with the nourishment that was being provided. Fleshly body power was rapidly building up, and clearly, Bai Xiaochun was rapidly reaching the point of breaking through from the level of six berserk ghosts to seven.</p><br/><p>Although he was being chased with murderous intent, the fact that his fleshly body was powering up so rapidly elated Bai Xiaochun. He could sense his power rapidly growing, and his battle prowess increasing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I could complete the second level of the Undying Heavenly King, and form the Heavenly Demon Body, then even if I run into one of those cultivators with the powerful magical treasures, I could still fight them!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad I can\u2019t reveal my identity, otherwise I could definitely beat those old Foundation Establishment experts!</p><br/><p>\u201cConsidering how things are at the moment, what should I do...?\u201d Moments ago, he had sensed that Xuemei had been about to unleash something incredibly dangerous on him, and as a result, was only getting more nervous.</p><br/><p>He looked over at Xuemei and Song Junwan briefly, then looked away. His head was starting to ache. Even as he tried to think of a way to resolve the situation, another sensation of imminent crisis filled him. This time, it didn\u2019t come from Xuemei, it came from behind him. One of Xuemei\u2019s Dharma protectors had been quietly closing in on him. It was none other than... Yang Hongwu!</p><br/><p>His eyes flickered with cold, merciless light, and his hand clutched a burning stick of incense!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, this was not because of any show of goodwill on the part of the Celestial. No, he just wanted to seal the world!</p><br/><p>Even he was shocked by the Daoist magic Bai Xiaochun had just unleashed, and therefore, he would ensure that no strange gates to other worlds could be opened, and no enormous beasts could appear!</p><br/><p>\u201cApparently I underestimated the Daoist magics that can be unleashed here\u2026. Waterswamp Kingdom\u2026.\u201d The Celestial\u2019s eyes glittered with bright light as he spoke. \u201cUnfortunately for you, that magic won\u2019t work now!\u201d</p><br/><p>With the wave of his hand, the Celestial unleashed the sealing power of the ring, causing it to rush in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had an equally serious expression on his face. He knew that the Celestial had been the lord of this world for many years, and had all sorts of reserve powers at his disposal. Not only could Bai Xiaochun not match up with him in terms of control of the power of the world, but he could also tell that the Celestial had so many techniques and items that it defied imagination.</p><br/><p>The ring he had just used emanated the most ancient of auras, something that left Bai Xiaochun with no doubts that it was a precious treasure. Although it likely couldn\u2019t match up to a world treasure, it surely had a very shocking origin.</p><br/><p>The sealing power which was currently descending onto him had a will of extermination in it, and yet, Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t shrink back. Instead, he stepped forward\u2026 and used the Undying Hex to slip past it!</p><br/><p>Virtually all types of seals and restrictive spells were useless against Bai Xiaochun. Even as he passed through the sealing power, he utilized his Mountain Shaking Bash, which caused him to accelerate rapidly toward the Celestial. Then he unleashed the Throat Crushing Grasp.</p><br/><p>However, it was at this point that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression flickered. Without any hesitation, he suddenly danced backward! However\u2026 he was too slow. A cynical smile spread out on the Celestial\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou really think someone like me would be scared of that life essence spirit of yours?! And how could I not know that the Undying Hex of the Undying Codex can allow you to pierce through all types of sealing magic\u2026? You might be able to avoid the sealing mark, but you can't avoid the true power of my magical item! You\u2019ve fallen right into my trap!\u201d Laughing uproariously, he waved his arms, causing the sealing power to suddenly fragment and shatter\u2026. As it did, it became a destructive force that rushed toward Bai Xiaochun from all sides.</p><br/><p>The use of the sealing power had just been a ruse! The Celestial\u2019s true goal had been to distract Bai Xiaochun, get him close, and then use the true power of his precious treasure!</p><br/><p>If one could view the scene from high above, they would see that Bai Xiaochun was now surrounded by mountain-toppling, sea-draining force that formed something like a huge ring around him, growing smaller and smaller with every passing moment\u2026.</p><br/><p>The destructive power skyrocketed with every moment that passed, causing Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face to fall from the sensation of deadly crisis that filled him.</p><br/><p>There was nothing he could do to fight back. The ring closed down in the blink of an eye, and the only thing he could do was reach out with his right hand, using it as a stand-in for his entire body!</p><br/><p>Intense pain stabbed through his right arm as the ring closed in around his flesh. As it did, the powers of regeneration within his flesh fought back against the ring.</p><br/><p>The Celestial frowned at how quickly Bai Xiaochun had reacted in this moment of crisis. Not only was he frustrated because of how difficult Bai Xiaochun was to deal with, he was left marveling at the shocking powers of the Undying Codex.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, I still need to pay a bit of a price to end things\u2026.\u201d The Celestial shook his head, then blurred into motion. Even as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s powers of regeneration worked against the binding of the ring, the Celestial unleashed another spectacular divine ability!</p><br/><p>Booms rang out as Bai Xiaochun fought back, and shockwaves spread out in all directions. However, Daoist Heavenspan\u2019s energy continued to rise; despite only being a quasi-celestial, he had plenty of reserve powers that could push his battle prowess very close to the true Mahayana Realm.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation base was lower than his, and he also had his right hand bound up. He shouldn\u2019t have been a match for Daoist Heavenspan, and yet, because of the heaven-defying powers of regeneration that came with the Undying Live Forever Technique, he could recover from injuries far more quickly than even the Blood Ancestor. As a result\u2026 he was on equal footing with the Celestial in a fight!</p><br/><p>Blue veins bulged out on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face and neck as his right hand clenched into a fist. By pouring all of the powers of regeneration he had at his disposal at the ring, as well as the full might of his fleshly body, he was finally able to overwhelm the precious treasure until it exploded!</p><br/><p>When that happened, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s battle prowess began to rise rapidly yet again. Clenching his hand into a fist, he struck out, causing a huge vortex to rumble toward the Celestial.</p><br/><p>The Celestial snorted coldly and backed up. Performing a right-handed incantation gesture, he waved his finger and spoke in a cold voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cGluttonous flood snake!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, from within the depths of the significantly depleted Heavenspan Seawater, a roar erupted that shook heaven and earth, accompanied by a shocking aura.</p><br/><p>Water showered down in all directions as a 30,000-meter-long creature appeared. It was very much like a flood dragon, with the body of a snake, and a huge 3,000-meter-long head that was vaguely dragon-like in appearance. Overall, it looked fierce to the extreme!</p><br/><p>Instantly, powerful fluctuations rolled out in all directions!</p><br/><p>\u201cFantastic crocodile!\u201d</p><br/><p>Things weren\u2019t over yet. The Celestial performed another incantation gesture, causing roars to echo out from all four of the Heavenspan Rivers. Along with the roars came four golden crocodiles, which merged together to form a single\u2026 30,000-meter-long, four-headed golden crocodile!</p><br/><p>\u201cGloom bird!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a huge roc appeared in the sky, howling in such a way that it caused everything to tremble!</p><br/><p>Closer inspection revealed that the roc was covered with rotting flesh, beneath which were dry bones! This bird\u2026 was actually a creature that had been dead for countless years!</p><br/><p>\u201cSludge giant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Next, the lands in the southern part of the Heavenspan region exploded, and an enormous stonebeetle crawled up from their depths. Everything around it immediately fossilized, causing massive white streaks to be left behind it as it crawled forth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI fought the gravekeeper for many years, Bai Xiaochun. I have profound reserve powers the likes of which no one in the world could possibly contend with. As for you\u2026 what the hell makes you think you can come fight me!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Celestial waved his finger at Bai Xiaochun, sending all four of the beasts rushing in his direction!</p><br/><p>Three of the animals were of little note to Bai Xiaochun. However, he had seen one of those golden crocodiles on numerous occasions. Of course, he could never have imagined that there were four of them\u2026 and that they belonged to the Celestial!!</p><br/><p>Shockingly, all of these beasts pulsed with the power of the great circle of the Demigod Realm!</p><br/><p>Clearly, the fact that the Blood Ancestor had fought with the Celestial for so long was suspicious, considering how powerful the former was\u2026. Granted, the Blood Ancestor was extraordinary, and had succeeded in buying time. However, the Celestial couldn\u2019t possibly have been so out of sorts after fighting him. Obviously\u2026 the Celestial had been waiting for the gravekeeper to succeed with his plan!</p><br/><p>The gravekeeper had been plotting against the Celestial, but the Celestial\u2026 had also been plotting against the gravekeeper!</p><br/><p>He had been waiting for Bai Xiaochun to arrive, but more importantly, had been waiting for the gravekeeper to die! The person the Celestial feared the most was the gravekeeper, a fear that had only grown deeper over the years in which the gravekeeper, despite growing weaker and weaker, had defeated him at every turn.</p><br/><p>Now that the gravekeeper was dead, the Celestial could finally breathe a sigh of relief. Everything had been complicated before, but now, all he had to do was consume Bai Xiaochun to get his Undying Live Forever Pill!</p><br/><p>Such thoughts flashed through Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind in the shortest of times.</p><br/><p>\u201cConsidering how much of a schemer Daoist Heavenspan is,\u201d he thought, \u201che must have something up his sleeve to make him completely and utterly confident in being able to win in the end! And there\u2019s no way\u2026 that his true secret weapon is these four beasts!\u201d He immediately began to back up. In this life-or-death battle with the Celestial, he had to maintain complete concentration. The Celestial\u2026 was the paragon entity in this world, and Bai Xiaochun knew that there was no room for slip-ups. If he made a mistake now, he would be dead forever!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

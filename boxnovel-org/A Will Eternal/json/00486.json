Everyone else had similar expressions on their faces as they looked at Bai Xiaochun standing there, laughing crazily.</p><br/><p>\u201cAphrodisiac Pill?\u201d Bai Lin said, mouth agape.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Before anyone could ask any more questions, Bai Xiaochun waved his sleeve, sweeping up all eight pill furnaces as he used the power of his Undying Tendons in his legs to leap into the air toward the Great Wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, big-bellied beasts,\u201d he said, his eyes shining brightly as he sailed through the air, \u201cBai Xiaochun is coming for you!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>As for Bai Lin, his eyes flickered as he suppressed his confusion and took a step to follow Bai Xiaochun. As for Zhao Long and the others, after a moment of hesitation, they also flew into motion toward the Great Wall, filled with curiosity about the medicinal pills Bai Xiaochun had created in such a terrifying state.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Bai Xiaochun to be atop the Great Wall itself, where he let out a shout and threw all of the pill furnaces out toward the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Down below, the giants of the savage tribes, as well as the seemingly endless sea of souls, were in the middle of a charge toward the wall. Now that the pill furnaces\u2019 power had been negated, the vengeful souls were under less pressure, and were easier to control. As a result, the necromancers had power to spare, which they used to upgrade some of the vengeful souls, making them much more powerful than before.</p><br/><p>More booms rang out on the battlefield than ever before. The increased power of the vengeful souls ensured that less savages were falling in battle, and at the same time, the pressure on the five legions had increased.</p><br/><p>As for the eight pill furnaces that had just been tossed out, they were crimson from heat, and were a shocking sight to behold. The mere thought of what would happen if they exploded was terrifying to contemplate.</p><br/><p>In fact, as soon as they appeared, the savage giants felt anxiety rising up in their hearts. However, they didn\u2019t panic. As they stared at the incoming furnaces, the black-robed old man on the black altar some distance away, as well as the necromancers and tribal chiefs by his side, were all watching the scene play out on a screen of water.</p><br/><p>\u201cScraping the bottom of the barrel, huh?\u201d the black-robed old man said coolly. \u201cThat move won\u2019t work anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Expression cold, he performed a right-handed incantation gesture and then waved his finger at the water screen. The screen rippled, after which a dozen or so spheroid beasts on the battlefield suddenly raised their heads and bellowed.</p><br/><p>Then, looks of disdain appeared on their faces as they opened their mouths wide and inhaled deeply!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the eight pill furnaces wobbled back and forth, and then shot toward the spheroid beasts, who began to fight amongst each other to consume them. Within moments, all of the pill furnaces had been swallowed down.</p><br/><p>As for the beasts who hadn\u2019t managed to swallow any furnaces, they began to howl in discontent.</p><br/><p>When the old man on the black altar saw the scene playing out, he smiled faintly, a look of scorn in his eyes.\u00a0</p><br/><p>This was the second time that the cultivators of the five legions had witnessed pill furnaces being consumed. Bai Lin stood there quietly, while the other cultivators let out light sighs.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was the only one who simply stood there, looking coldly at the eight beasts who had swallowed the pill furnaces.</p><br/><p>\u201cEat up,\u201d he murmured, \u201cand don\u2019t spill a drop!\u201d</p><br/><p>A muffled thump rang out, and the huge beasts\u2019 bellies expanded for a moment before shrinking back down to normal.</p><br/><p>The beasts then looked threateningly toward the Great Wall and let out menacing howls before turning, as if to leave. Simultaneously, a large number of savage giants flew over to protect them. Meanwhile, the other savage giants on the battlefield began to call out in taunting fashion.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got? Those magical items are useless against us now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose wimps on the Great Wall are still trying this gimmick? Eight pill furnaces aren\u2019t even enough to get our beasts full!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow moronic can you get? Their pill furnace trick didn't work last time, and yet they tried the same thing again!\u201d</p><br/><p>When the cultivators of the five legions heard the laughter ringing out from the battlefield, they gritted their teeth in frustration. Were it not for orders passed down by the deva to hold their position on the wall, they would definitely have poured out in deadly fashion and filled the battlefield with rivers of Wildlander blood.</p><br/><p>Bai Lin sighed, and turned to Bai Xiaochun as if to say something.</p><br/><p>Before he could, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes narrowed, and he murmured, \u201cAny moment now, and their laughter will cease. When I get pissed off, I frighten even myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bai Lin heard that, he was taken aback. And then, before he could ask any questions, the eight beasts who had consumed the pill furnaces suddenly stopped moving.</p><br/><p>A moment later, their expressions flickered, and slowly, their eyes began to turn bright red. They began shivering, and even opened their mouths to burp out pink smoke. In fact, their entire bodies suddenly seemed to be glowing red.</p><br/><p>Hoarse pants could be heard, which soon turned into clamoring howls. As the surrounding savage giants looked on in shock, the eight beasts suddenly turned on them and pounced in full madness.</p><br/><p>Two of the beasts even turned on their own kind with maddened howls. It took only a moment before all eight of the beasts were pouncing on anything nearby that moved....</p><br/><p>All of them were under the complete control of the Aphrodisiac Pill!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, because the Aphrodisiac Pills had exploded inside of the beasts, the energy released was impossible to dispel. It was difficult to put into words the incredible power contained in pills like that, pills which had been refined four times!</p><br/><p>Whether the beasts were male or female didn't matter. As long as the pill furnaces had exploded in their stomachs, they were bereft of all sense of reason, and became lost within the effects of the Aphrodisiac Pill. If that were all there were to the situation, it might not have been a big deal. However, they continuously belched out pink smoke, smoke that didn\u2019t affect the vengeful souls, but most definitely affected the savage giants!</p><br/><p>All the giants had to do was get a whiff of that smoke, and their faces would instantly flush. A moment later, their eyes would turn both blank and bloodshot at the same time, and they would throw their heads back and roar.</p><br/><p>In the briefest of moments, the entire battlefield was thrown into complete and utter chaos....</p><br/><p>Screams and shrieks rang out in all directions. As of this moment, the area outside the Great Wall didn\u2019t look like a battlefield at all, but rather, a scene of absolute pandemonium....</p><br/><p>One of the main reasons why these Aphrodisiac Pills were so terrifyingly effective was that Bai Xiaochun had combined his original formula with his Fantasy Pill formula. He had even performed spirit enhancements on some of the main ingredients. Thus, the pills were far more shocking than they had ever been before.</p><br/><p>The cultivators on the Great Wall looked down, their minds spinning, looks of blank shock on their faces, their hearts battered by waves of astonishment because of what they were witnessing.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-this... this....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey... dammit! What exactly is going on?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat medicinal pills were they? Heavens!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone from the five legions was talking about what was happening, whether they were ordinary soldiers, lieutenants, captains, and even the colonels and major generals. Without exception, the shocking scene playing out caused them all to lose their cool.</p><br/><p>Even Bai Lin, a general of the five legions, felt his mind spinning in astonishment.</p><br/><p>In fact, the indescribable scene playing out was so shocking that the huge eye on top of the pagoda flickered. Then, three-eyed Chen Hetian appeared. He was a respected deva, and yet even he couldn\u2019t help but gasp, and then look over at Bai Xiaochun with a very strange expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this really the Great Wall?\u201d he thought.\u00a0</p><br/><p>In fact, everyone was similarly stunned. As of this moment, the name of the pill\u2019s creator, Bai Xiaochun, was being indelibly branded into the minds of everyone present. \u201cFor the rest of my life, I must make sure to never, ever provoke the terrifying Bai Xiaochun!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>As countless gasps rang out, and the chaos on the battlefield continued to play out, the black-robed old man on the black altar, as well as the surrounding necromancers and tribal chiefs, were all watching what was happening.</p><br/><p>Deathly silence prevailed on the altar, as all eyes were completely glued to the water screen. No one was talking, and in fact, none of them were even breathing. It took a long moment before any breathing to occur, but when it did, it soon turned into panting, and eventually the entire group was physically shaking.</p><br/><p>Then, cries of rage began to ring out from the altar.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Wildlands will destroy you or die in the attempt!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven-damned Bai Xiaochun! Y-y-you... you will not die a good death!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIssue a death warrant! Tell the whole world that this Bai Xiaochun must die!! If he doesn\u2019t die, the Wildlands will live in disgrace for all time!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

With the requisite approval, he had become a half-sovereign, and yet, as of this moment, he was nearly overwhelmed with a sensation of deadly crisis!</p><br/><p>Of the two enemies he faced, both were half-sovereigns like himself. Although the Saint-Emperor wasn\u2019t enough on his own, Song Que had already died in the past. Later, Bai Xiaochun placed him in the tower with the Dao Essence of Life and Death, with which he conformed perfectly. After absorbing it, something which was foul and rotten was turned into something rare and magical, and he was able to live again within death!!</p><br/><p>The moment he opened his eyes, he became the apprentice of the Worldly Daoist. And in fact, had the Worldly Daoist not already perished, then when Song Que awoke, he wouldn\u2019t have been a half-sovereign, but a true sovereign!</p><br/><p>In this respect, he was somewhat similar to Daoist Heavenspan. However, the main difference between the two was that the Mortal Renegade still existed, whereas the Worldly Daoist was no more!</p><br/><p>Unfortunately for Daoist Heavenspan, the Mortal Renegade was still asleep, and therefore, despite having his approval, it wasn\u2019t possible for him to become a sovereign. He was only able to take half a step into that level!</p><br/><p>When the Mortal Renegade awoke, Daoist Heavenspan could use his power to completely step into the Sovereign Realm. Although he would still pale in comparison to the Mortal Renegade, he would still be a sovereign!</p><br/><p>But now, it seemed unlikely that Daoist Heavenspan would survive until the Mortal Renegade woke up. The fight between him and Song Que seemed almost like a continuation of the feud between the Mortal Renegade and the Worldly Daoist. And unluckily for Daoist Heavenspan, he was actually facing two opponents, who as of this moment, had the clear advantage over him.</p><br/><p>His hair was disheveled, and his eyes were bright red as he began to fight anxiously. He now had no choice but to do everything he could to gain an advantage. Biting the tip of his tongue, he spat out seven mouthfuls of blood, each one causing his hair to turn whiter, and his body to shrivel. By the end, he looked like a crazed old man.</p><br/><p>\u201cSovereign!!\u201d he shouted, his voice thrumming with what seemed like the power of natural law.</p><br/><p>As the ripples of his voice spread out, a vortex sprang up on the forehead of the enormous Mortal Renegade, who loomed behind him there in the starry sky. Then, a stream of divine sense shot out from the vortex.</p><br/><p>The heaven-shaking, earth-shattering divine sense contained a powerful aura of both nirvanic extermination and ultimate death, which covered everything, creating an attack that Song Que and the Saint-Emperor had no hope of defending against!</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as they coughed up blood, then staggered backward, out of control, blood oozing out of their eyes, ears, noses, and mouths.</p><br/><p>The divine sense was just too strong; it didn\u2019t matter that they were half-sovereigns, they simply couldn\u2019t stand up to it! Thankfully, it was only one quick blast of divine sense, otherwise, Daoist Heavenspan wouldn\u2019t have needed to expend any more effort to seriously injure them!</p><br/><p>It was divine sense straight from the Mortal Renegade, which Daoist Heavenspan had paid a huge price to unleash as a trump card!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t wish to unleash more of it. Unfortunately for him, the Mortal Renegade was asleep, and could therefore only release a small portion of his divine sense!</p><br/><p>Although it quickly faded away, the Saint-Emperor and Song Que were shaken all the way down to their souls, and were temporarily stunned, to the point where they had nothing separating themselves from Daoist Heavenspan.</p><br/><p>And that brief opening was all that Daoist Heavenspan had hoped for. Without any hesitation, he performed a double-handed incantation gesture, causing balls of 300-meter-tall black smoke to appear, one in each hand. Then, he launched the two balls of smoke at Song Que and the Saint-Emperor!</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!\u201d Daoist Heavenspan said in a cold voice. The two balls of smoke pulsed with a voracious power that seemed to want to consume anything it touched. Upon seeing that, the eyes of both Song Que and the Saint-Emperor widened.</p><br/><p>The smoke almost seemed to be alive, especially considering the howls which erupted from inside them. In fact, looking closely at them would reveal that red light glowed inside of them!</p><br/><p>Daoist Heavenspan was clearly putting everything on the line. Those two balls of smoke were not ordinary in nature, and Daoist Heavenspan himself was severely withered from the effort of unleashing them. In order to unleash the power of Essence here, he had drawn heavily upon his own life force and his soul!</p><br/><p>\u201cWe can\u2019t let it touch us!\u201d That was what both Song Que and the Saint-Emperor were thinking. Even as they fell back at top speed, the smoke balls locked onto them, piercing through the void toward them at top speed. Glaring, Song Que struck the top of his own head, injuring himself and shaking his own divine soul to gain a moment of added clarity. Without any hesitation, he sent out a stream of divine sense to summon the two archaean slaves. An instant, later, they appeared in front of him and the Saint-Emperor, standing in for them to take the blow of the two spheres of smoke.</p><br/><p>Everything was happening so quickly that Daoist Heavenspan had no time to change the course of the smoke spheres, which instantly slammed into the archaean slaves.</p><br/><p>When Daoist Heavenspan saw that his tactic was about to be defeated by Song Que, his eyes burned with killing intent. He was a decisive person, and therefore, it was without any hesitation that he performed a double-handed incantation gesture and spoke in a devilish, demonic voice!</p><br/><p>\u201cDevil-Sun, Demon-Moon!\u201d A howl erupted out that seemed to originate from the most ancient of times, causing heaven and earth to tremble, and the Eternal Immortal Domains to be cast into darkness. It contained indescribable power, and as it spread out, the two balls of smoke consumed the archaean slaves, corroding their bodies and sucking away at their life force. In the blink of an eye, the two archaean slaves\u2019 souls were extracted, and their flesh and blood were completely assimilated!</p><br/><p>They had been sealed and left behind by the Worldly Daoist, but now, the Worldly Daoist was dead. And thanks to this bizarre magical technique unleashed by Daoist Heavenspan, they could not defend against the smoke. As that happened, the two balls of smoke began to transform, growing larger and more shockingly powerful, until they resembled a shining sun and a full moon!</p><br/><p>When that happened, the cultivators of the Eternal Immortal Domains suddenly felt so much pressure weighing down on them that they couldn't breathe. Although many of them couldn\u2019t see what was happening, the Grand Heavenmaster and other celestials could. And they knew that if Daoist Heavenspan could turn the tables here, it would be devastating.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaoist Heavenspan\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for him, there wouldn\u2019t have been so many deaths when the Heavenspan Realm entered the Eternal Immortal Domains. He\u2019s the one that made us pay the steepest of prices!\u201d Everyone had various feelings about Daoist Heavenspan, but for the most part, all of them hated him as much as Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>And yet, they all had to admit that he really was a spectacular cultivator. He had incredible natural talents, and had built up enough power in the original Heavenspan Realm that he nearly brought an end to the bloodline of the Arch-Ancestor. To leave that realm, he had ignored family love, and had been willing to sacrifice anything and everything to destroy the body of the Arch-Ancestor.</p><br/><p>He could only be described as ambitious and ruthless. And that had led him to a position of cultivation base power that few people could challenge. Therefore, although many people hated him, all of them had to admit that he was incredibly strong!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it would be easier to find a phoenix feather or a qilin horn than to find someone who could react as decisively as he had just now, in a moment of profoundly deadly crisis!</p><br/><p>As Daoist Heavenspan was turning the tables in his fight, the last dandelion seeds that contained Bai Xiaochun\u2019s life force and divine sense were landing in the most distant regions of the void.</p><br/><p>In roughly a third of the regions that had been reached, moonflowers had already bloomed, and were shining with bright light. As of this moment, it was almost a visible contest between the forces of light and the forces of darkness!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

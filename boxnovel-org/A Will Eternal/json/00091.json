As everyone sat there, the north bank disciples bristled, glaring angrily... at Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>The contestants were all itching to begin the second round, in which they would do anything possible to take Bai Xiaochun out. By now, none of them cared whether or not the north bank won in the end; they merely wanted to shed his blood to wash away their humiliation!</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun, in the second round, I'm going to make you pay a horrifying price for humiliating the north bank!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe should be given to an entire pack of beasts to ease our hatred. This second round will be the most painful experience of his life!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTake Bai Xiaochun down! Take this shameless bastard down!\u201d</p><br/><p>The north bank cared about nothing but taking out Bai Xiaochun, and that responsibility was given to the eight people who had made it through the first round. Although Ghostfang simply sat there with his eyes closed, the other seven glared angrily at Bai Xiaochun with clenched fists.</p><br/><p>They represented all of the other disciples of the north bank, and were now analyzing what they had learned about him from his previous performance. All of them were coming up with their own ways of dealing with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll Bai Xiaochun has are some medicinal pills. As long as he doesn\u2019t have a chance to use them, he can be dealt with easily!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe only won because of those medicinal pills. Without them, exterminating him will be as easy as turning over your hand. He\u2019ll definitely be defeated in the second round. Defeated, and defeated ruthlessly!\u201d</p><br/><p>As far as Bai Xiaochun was concerned, the north bank disciples were acting like bullies. He\u2019d won, hadn\u2019t he? As for the brutality of that victory... he wanted to say something in his defense, but was worried that if he said the wrong thing, it would only make things worse. Much worse.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is ridiculous!\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>As the north bank stewed in their anger, the south bank disciples didn\u2019t say much either. They simply sat there bristling until Ouyang Jie finally spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThree incense sticks have burned. The second round of the Chosen battles will now begin, and the top six will be selected!</p><br/><p>\u201cOf the eleven of you, one will sit out of the fighting and directly enter the top six. The other ten will draw lots and fight each other in twos to proceed!\u201d Accompanying Ouyang Jie\u2019s words, a beam of light shot out over the arena floor, which transformed into a glowing sphere, roughly three meters in diameter. In turn, the pearls in the hands of Bai Xiaochun and the other remaining contestants were tugged toward it. Upon releasing the pearls, they flew directly toward the glowing sphere.</p><br/><p>Once inside, new numbers appeared on their surfaces, from one to ten, with one of the pearls being blank.</p><br/><p>The eleven pearls began to rotate inside the sphere, moving faster and faster until they were nothing more than a blur.</p><br/><p>\u201cA secret magic is at work here to ensure complete and utter fairness,\u201d explained Ouyang Jie. \u201cNot even I can interfere with the pearls. Rest at ease as you take the marbles back to decide the order of fighting.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Song glared at Bai Xiaochun and then chuckled coldly. \u201cBai Xiaochun, you\u2019d better pray that you don\u2019t fight me. I\u2019ll crush you like a twig!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he waved his hand, causing a pearl to fly out into his hand.</p><br/><p>One of the other north bank Chosen gritted his teeth and coldly said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who you face, you\u2019re definitely going to lose painfully in the second round!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he and everyone else, Bai Xiaochun included, made grasping motions to secure their pearls.</p><br/><p>Instantly, ten pearls flew out toward the group of contestants.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have number three!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm number seven!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI got number one!\u201d When the north bank disciples got their pearls, they announced the numbers. Soon, the order of fighting was becoming clear. After they announced their numbers, they looked ferociously toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Eventually, Ghostfang got his pearl and coolly said, \u201cNumber nine!\u201d</p><br/><p>The north bank disciples soon found that not a single one of their number had acquired the blank pearl. As of this moment, the only pearls left were numbers four and ten, as well as the blank pearl. The north bank disciples began to look nervously over at the south bank.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m number four!\u201d Shangguan Tianyou announced coolly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNumber ten!\u201d Zhou Xinqi said, her face somewhat unsightly. As soon as the words left her mouth, she looked over at Ghostfang.</p><br/><p>By now, everyone\u2019s fighting spot had been determined, with the exception of Bai Xiaochun. Strange expressions appeared on the faces of the south bank audience, especially the Fragrant Cloud Peak disciples, who had been there to watch Bai Xiaochun fight in the smaller competition. Their eyes went as wide as saucers.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way....\u201d they thought incredulously.</p><br/><p>Even more incredulous than them were the north bank disciples, who so badly wanted to teach him a lesson. Fists clenched, the entire group stared blankly at Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t keep from looking a bit proud. The pearl in his hand had no number on it whatsoever. At first, he'd thought that he might have seen incorrectly. However, after closer examination, he confirmed that it was indeed blank. Then he looked around and realized that everyone was staring at him, and suddenly, he realized how lonely life could be sometimes.... Flicking his sleeve, he assumed the manner of a lonely hero, staring up into the clouds. Voice cool, he said, \u201cMy apologies. I\u2019ll be sitting this round out. If you want to fight me, you\u2019ll have to work hard to get to the next round.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were met with a moment of silence. A few breaths\u2019 worth of time passed, and then the north bank audience erupted into enraged shouting.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! Dammit, he\u2019s sitting the round out!? Why did it have to be him, the shameless Bai Xiaochun. Why?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could he be so lucky!? Out of eleven people, I can\u2019t believe that he gets to sit the round out!! How could someone like him have luck like this!? It\u2019s preposterous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t take this. What an absolute show-off! I HAVE to take him down!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The north bank disciples had intended to wash their humiliation clean with violence, but now that Bai Xiaochun was sitting the round out, they very nearly coughed up mouthfuls of blood. It was almost like they had just tried to punch Bai Xiaochun in the face, but ended up striking nothing but air. Frustration fermenting inside of them, Xu Song and the others stared at Bai Xiaochun as if they wished they could rip him to pieces right then and there.</p><br/><p>Even the south bank disciples looked on with odd expressions, unsure of what to say. It was already obvious that the north bank disciples wanted to fight Bai Xiaochun more than anything else, so it wasn't even necessary to ponder how they felt regarding this sudden development.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s nothing!\u201d blurted out a random Fragrant Cloud Peak disciple. \u201cBack in the minor competition, Sect Uncle Bai... sat out for two rounds in a row!\u201d When the people sitting around him heard that, their eyes went wide with disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis happened to him before? Sect Uncle Bai\u2019s luck... is unbelievable!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat, and yet again assumed the posture of a lonely hero. Looking over at the north bank side, he slowly shook his head. That, of course, made the north bank even angrier.</p><br/><p>However, getting angrier didn\u2019t change the situation at all. They had no option but to stifle their feelings as the second round of the Chosen battles began.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, without Bai Xiaochun fighting, the entire affair was a lot less interesting. Furthermore, the south bank only had two disciples in the mix, which meant that three of the battles would involve disciples from the north bank fighting each other.</p><br/><p>The first battle was just such a situation. Gongsun Wan\u2019er fought one of the other north bank disciples, and defeated him effortlessly. The defeated disciple trudged off of the arena floor, looking over his shoulder at the south bank side, mixed emotions playing across his face.</p><br/><p>The second battle saw Shangguan Tianyou take the field. Luckily for him, he didn\u2019t face one of the top Chosen, but another random disciple, whom he defeated as easily as blowing some dust off of his shoulder. The south bank audience breathed sighs of relief. At least... they had secured victory in one fight.</p><br/><p>Next, the north bank again fought itself in the third and fourth battles. Although the fighting was intense, the fact that the south bank wasn\u2019t involved at all ensured that the disciples that were from there simply looked on silently.</p><br/><p>In the final battle, Zhou Xinqi walked out with a serious expression on her face. Although the south bank disciples cheered, they weren\u2019t too optimistic about the outcome of the battle.</p><br/><p>After all, Zhou Xinqi\u2019s opponent... was the terrifying Ghostfang, who had almost killed Lu Tianlei with the single wave of a finger.</p><br/><p>After stepping out onto the arena floor, Ghostfang curiously asked, \u201cBetween you and that lightning guy, who\u2019s stronger?\u201d</p><br/><p>Sensing that his intention was not to humiliate her, Zhou Xinqi answered honestly: \u201cElder Brother Lu is a bit stronger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about this....\u201d Ghost replied quietly. \u201cI used seventy percent power last time. This time, I\u2019ll only use forty percent. You probably won\u2019t get killed by that.\u201d Those who could hear him looked on with bitter smiles, convinced that Ghostfang was being honest.</p><br/><p>Zhou Xinqi took a deep breath and then performed a double-handed incantation gesture. Instantly, countless blue sparks appeared around her, forming numerous blue flying silks. The flying silks then merged together into something that resembled a huge flower, that pulsed with a powerful gravitational force!</p><br/><p>\u201cPlant Transformation Incantation!\u201d When the crowd from the south bank saw the Plant Transformation Incantation being used, their eyes glittered. Although it wasn\u2019t quite on the same level as Ghosts Haunt the Night or the Waterswamp Kingdom, it was one of the ten secret magics of the sect.</p><br/><p>It was a unique magic that used plants against the enemy, with numerous variations that made it enigmatic and unpredictable. When Li Qinghou used it, he could create a world of plants and vegetation 50 kilometers wide. The final upgraded version of the secret magic had another name... Magic Plant Arsenal!</p><br/><p>Using the magic was such a drain on Zhou Xinqi\u2019s energy that her face went pale. She knew that she wasn\u2019t a match for this opponent, but in her world, it wasn\u2019t an option to just concede without trying.</p><br/><p>The wave of her hand caused the blue flower to tremble, and then grow larger at a rapid rate, simultaneously shooting toward Ghostfang. It almost looked like the flower was opening wide to consume him.</p><br/><p>It was a spectacular sight that instantly attracted the attention of Bai Xiaochun, who found the magical technique particularly interesting. However, it was at this point that Ghostfang looked up calmly and then waved his finger.</p><br/><p>This time, he didn't wave his finger at the sky, but at Zhou Xinqi. The air next to him began to vibrate, and a huge black clawed ghost hand appeared, which quickly clenched into a fist!</p><br/><p>The huge fist filled half of the arena floor, and was so big people couldn\u2019t see anything else. It smashed into the blue flower, which trembled and then collapsed into ashes. The clawed ghost hand, however, didn't stop. It continued on as if nothing had happened, smashing directly into Zhou Xinqi.</p><br/><p>A massive boom echoed out, and blood sprayed out of Zhou Xinqi\u2019s mouth as she tumbled backward. She was knocked out of the arena floor, and when she finally ground to a halt, she coughed up eight mouthfuls of blood. Face pale, she looked up with a stubborn gleam in her eyes to see Ghostfang turning and walking away.</p><br/><p>Everything was silent except for the gasps that echoed out....</p><br/>\n</div>"}

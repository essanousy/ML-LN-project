He didn\u2019t dare to descend into reminiscence. Instead, he focused on one thing!</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Li\u2026 you <em>have</em> to be alive\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anxiety gripped his heart, profound nervousness generated, not from fear for himself, but from the possibility that he might hear news that could crush him.</p><br/><p>Mental pressure began to mount, and his cultivation base was going crazy. All of the anxiety and madness swirled together, making a cyclone that dimmed heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun moved so fast that not even Bruiser could keep up. He shot through the air alone, leaving thunderous sonic booms behind him as he went.</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!</p><br/><p>The massive sound caused by his passage attracted the attention of local cultivator clans, small-scale sects, and city after city. Everyone looked up in shock, and yet, they couldn\u2019t see Bai Xiaochun! They only saw a long wound-like streak appear above them in the sky!</p><br/><p>Countless gasps and exclamations of shock filled the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was that sound?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sky\u2026 is being ripped open?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>From a distance, the streak he left behind really did look like a rift opening up in the sky!!</p><br/><p>Time ticked by. In the end, it took less time than an incense stick takes to burn. In his rage and anxiety, Bai Xiaochun appeared\u2026 in the mountains containing the Dao River Court!!</p><br/><p>The sect headquarters was made of seven mountain peaks, each one a different color!</p><br/><p>Because the routing of the three sects back on the battlefield had happened so quickly, the Dao River Court in general wasn\u2019t fully aware of what had happened. In fact, most of them didn\u2019t even know that their patriarch had lost his fleshly body. Only a few people had been informed, who then ordered that the sect\u2019s grand spell formation be activated.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when Bai Xiaochun arrived, he saw a glittering light shield surrounding the sect, preventing anyone from entering!</p><br/><p>It was a powerful shield which radiated intense pressure. After all\u2026 it was the grand spell formation of the number one sect in the Middle Reaches cultivation world of the eastern Heavenspan River!</p><br/><p>But no matter how powerful that spell formation was, it couldn\u2019t compare to the spell formation that had protected the former Great Wall. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Undying Hex had been able to pierce through that spell formation, and therefore, this trifling formation belonging to a Middle Reaches sect couldn\u2019t possibly do anything to him, not even if it had been created by a deva!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t slow down for even a moment. In fact, he sped up. Rumbling sounds filled the air as he bore down on the Dao River Court, which currently housed several tens of thousands of cultivators who hadn\u2019t been mobilized during the war. That group included three Nascent Soul experts and many in the Core Formation stage. When they saw something streaking toward them through the sky, their eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sky\u2026 is being ripped open? But how?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? That rift is actually heading right toward us!!\u201d</p><br/><p>No one in the group, not even the Nascent Soul experts, were able to see Bai Xiaochun. He was moving too quickly! The only thing they could see was that rift being slashed open in the sky!</p><br/><p>Even as they began to cry out in alarm, the rift reached the grand spell formation. And yet, bizarrely, the spell formation didn\u2019t react at all. There wasn\u2019t even the slightest ripple! Bai Xiaochun pierced right through it!</p><br/><p>That was the power of the Undying Hex!</p><br/><p>As soon as he was inside the Dao River Court, he slammed into one of the mountains, causing the sky to tremble and the land to vibrate.</p><br/><p>RRRUUUUMBLE!</p><br/><p>The mountain immediately began to crumble, with countless bits of rock and rubble showering down. Tens of thousands of cultivators dashed out of the way, crying out in alarm. Only at this point did the figure which had previously been impossible to see suddenly become clear in midair above the crumbling mountain!</p><br/><p>Even as he hovered there, terrifying fluctuations rolled out, as well as a massive vortex which seemed capable of destroying the world.</p><br/><p>The disciples of the Dao River Court gasped and trembled. Even the Nascent Soul cultivators were shaking in nervousness. However, this was their sect headquarters, so no matter how scared they were, they had to brace themselves and attack. Instantly, countless beams of light that represented magical techniques began to slash through the air toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>At the same time, deadly beams of light shot from the other mountain peaks in his direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet the hell out of my way!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun roared, waving his hands out in front of him. A blast of wind spread out in all directions, slamming into the beams of light and magical techniques. All of them were crushed as easily as dried weeds, and yet, the blast of wind didn\u2019t stop.</p><br/><p>The sect headquarters trembled, and blood sprayed out of the mouths of countless disciples. Screams echoed out as they fell back, and yet, before they could get anywhere, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s divine sense shot out. In the blink of an eye, it filled the entire Dao River Court. Not even restricted areas and places locked down by spell formations were able to remain hidden. It was at this point that, deep underground beneath the Dao River Court\u2026 he found Li Qinghou\u2019s aura!</p><br/><p>There, in a dank dungeon beneath the sect, were numerous prisoners, one of whom was the unconscious Li Qinghou\u2026 who appeared to be gasping on the verge of death!</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun saw that Li Qinghou was still alive, he breathed a sigh of relief. However, it was then that he realized what bad shape Li Qinghou was in, and his rage mounted. Without the slightest hesitation, he blurred into motion, unleashing a fist strike directly at the ground!</p><br/><p>Crevices snaked out as the earth was ripped open. Numerous Dao River Court disciples were sent tumbling away from the force of the blow, their minds reeling and their hearts shivering in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s Bai Xiaochun. He\u2019s the one\u2026 who beat the three devas! He killed one, devastated the other, and sent the third running away!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, what is he doing here\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had already destroyed one of the seven mountains that comprised the sect headquarters. Now, his blow caused a second mountain to be ripped up and transformed into rubble.</p><br/><p>At this point, Bai Xiaochun realized that one of the strange features of the Dao River Court\u2019s headquarters was its unusually thick ground. The seven mountain peaks of the sect were all connected at the base, which meant that to get to the underground area, all of the mountains had to be destroyed.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was in no mood to go about it one at a time. Rapidly performing an incantation gesture, he let out a shout, utilizing the Living Mountain Incantation to cause countless rocks in the area to rush toward him and transform him into a gigantic stone golem!</p><br/><p>That stone golem\u2019s face looked exactly like Bai Xiaochun's! Without the slightest hesitation, he unleashed a second fist strike, which shattered more of the lands below. At the same time, two of the remaining five mountains began to collapse. Cries of alarm and terror filled the air as countless disciples fled in terror, unwilling to stay behind in their own sect headquarters.</p><br/><p>As they fled, Bai Xiaochun let out a shout that caused the sky to distort. A third fist strike landed like a meteor falling from the heavens.</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOM!</p><br/><p>The remaining three mountain peaks collapsed amidst deafening rumbling sounds. The Dao River Court\u2026 had been reduced to rubble!!</p><br/><p>From the time Bai Xiaochun arrived until the deed was done, not even sixty breaths of time had passed!!</p><br/><p>As of this moment, the only thing that remained in the ground was a massive crater!</p><br/><p>At the bottom of that crater was the Dao River Court\u2019s dungeon!</p><br/><p>Without pausing for a moment, Bai Xiaochun blurred into motion, vanished, and then reappeared outside of Li Qinghou\u2019s cell!</p><br/><p>The intense noise from moments ago caused Li Qinghou\u2019s eyes to flutter open. His aura was profoundly weak as he looked over at Bai Xiaochun. When he saw who it was, his eyes widened.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaochun?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

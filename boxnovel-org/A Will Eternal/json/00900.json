That was where his immortal's cave was located.</p><br/><p>In the past, there had only been five people who qualified to live on the blue rainbow, but now there was a sixth!</p><br/><p>What left the disciples of the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect even more shaken was the knowledge that this Patriarch Bai Xiaochun was no ordinary deva. Even after having just reached the Deva Realm, he dominated three of the other deva patriarchs, and also killed three devas from the Middle Reaches. Battle achievements like that were essentially heaven-defying in nature.</p><br/><p>Few people would be willing to provoke someone that strong. Besides, the newly-appointed Patriarch Bai Xiaochun had another role in the sect that made him even more domineering. He was a deva patriarch in the Hall of Steel Veins!</p><br/><p>The Hall of Steel Veins had always been a very powerful force within the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect. They were warrior cultivators who had fought for years in bloody campaigns along the Great Wall, and had shockingly murderous auras. They were the type of people who no one would dare to provoke.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had incredible battle prowess, and an extremely high position in the sect. A deva patriarch like that was the type who would naturally leave the whole sect feeling shaken, and would be the subject of much respect and adoration.</p><br/><p>Because of that, he had absolutely no spare time after his return. Every day, crowds of visitors flocked to his immortal\u2019s cave on the blue rainbow.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Steel Veins was the first to arrive. The two chatted merrily for a bit, and eventually agreed to form a loose alliance between the two of them. Afterward, the patriarch left, smiling the entire time.</p><br/><p>The second person to visit was the child deva from Sky Quarter Rainbow. It was a bit awkward at first. They made some small talk, and then he expressed his goodwill, hoping to put behind them the fact that he hadn\u2019t stepped in to help the River-Defying Sect.</p><br/><p>Next came numerous Nascent Soul cultivators, who offered respectful greetings, as well as gifts, in the hopes of forging a good relationship with Bai Xiaochun. Some of them were experts from Sky Quarter Rainbow, former rivals and enemies who, despite having mixed feelings, expressed nothing but friendly respect.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun handled all of these situations with ease. After all, he had built up a lot of experience with this kind of thing over the years. He had become especially used to having a high position of authority back in the Wildlands, and had grown very used to conducting himself properly. He put pressure on some people, and treated others coldly. He greeted certain individuals warmly, and joked with others.</p><br/><p>Of course, everything that was happening was being closely observed by the devas who were his neighbors.</p><br/><p>Chen Hetian, Li Xiandao and Bai Zhentian all snorted coldly in their hearts, and yet could do nothing other than sit there quietly. They knew that it wouldn\u2019t be wise to stir up trouble right when Bai Xiaochun was making his big debut.</p><br/><p>There were a few people who Bai Xiaochun treated with particular warmth and sincerity when they came to visit. One of them was the hallmaster from the Hall of Devil Slayers, who had received hints from Du Lingfei to watch out for Bai Xiaochun. His name was Feng Youde!</p><br/><p>Feng Youde had prepared a lavish gift for Bai Xiaochun. As far as he was concerned, he had struck it very lucky over the years. After doing as he said he would do, and taking care of Bai Xiaochun, Du Lingfei had kept her promise. Although Feng Youde had not quite reached the Deva Realm because of her help, he was very close.</p><br/><p>How could he ever have imagined that his decision all those years ago would benefit him a second time? After hearing that Bai Xiaochun had actually become a deva, he had immediately become very excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cVirtue has its rewards!\u201d he thought, sighing emotionally. He treated Bai Xiaochun with the utmost respect, and was personally escorted out, which was a huge honor. After he left, he felt more wonderful than ever.</p><br/><p>After three days passed, the stream of visitors slowed down, causing Bai Xiaochun to sigh a bit. He had very much enjoyed the busy three days.</p><br/><p>Thanks to having so many visitors, Bai Xiaochun learned a lot about what had gone on in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect during his many years of absence.</p><br/><p>He was also reminded that patriarchs from the Hall of Steel Veins were considered elders in the sect, and not just ordinary elders, but prime elders.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, there were only six prime elders in the entire Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect! Underneath those prime elders were nearly a hundred Nascent Soul elders. Collectively, they made up\u2026 the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect\u2019s Cabinet of Elders!</p><br/><p>Unless the demigod patriarch interfered, the Cabinet of Elders essentially made all the decisions in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect!</p><br/><p>Because of their place in that organization, Chen Hetian, Bai Zhentian, Li Xiandao, and the child deva Li Yuanda had the power and authority to manage all aspects of the sect. Whether it was affairs downriver, alliances with other riversource sects, or communications with Heavenspan Island, it was within the scope of their responsibilities.</p><br/><p>Matters both big and small were determined by those four devas. However, the one thing they had no say in\u2026 was war!</p><br/><p>War\u2026 was the jurisdiction of the Hall of Steel Veins. Before, it had been the sole responsibility of Patriarch Steel Veins. But now, Bai Xiaochun was being added to the mix. The two of them were the only ones who could send the ancient and powerful Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect into battle.</p><br/><p>Of course, the demigod patriarch could overturn any order. However, when it came to the fighting at the Great Wall, or other conflicts in other areas, the Hall of Steel Veins always took the lead.</p><br/><p>Because of the incredibly high status that Bai Xiaochun now had, he qualified to look into many areas of inquiry that had been closed to him before.</p><br/><p>For example\u2026 Heavenspan Island!!</p><br/><p>For example\u2026 Du Lingfei\u2019s status as Heavenspan emissary!</p><br/><p>For example\u2026 Hou Xiaomei and Ghostfang!</p><br/><p>Based on everything that he had seen in the Wildlands, matters pertaining to Heavenspan Island weren\u2019t as much of a mystery anymore. Although he didn't understand everything fully, he had a pretty good idea.</p><br/><p>The Celestial really was the emperor of the Heavenspan River region!</p><br/><p>The four riversource sects corresponded to the Wildlands\u2019 four heavenly kings, and acted like regional governors!</p><br/><p>Heavenspan Island was where the Celestial\u2019s Palace of the Dao was located.</p><br/><p>And when Du Lingfei went out on missions\u2026 she ranked the same as a demigod!</p><br/><p>In terms of the selection process which had ended up taking Hou Xiaomei and others to Heavenspan Island, Bai Xiaochun was now able to confirm that it really was just a matter of course.</p><br/><p>\u201cDu Lingfei\u2026 left the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect quite a few years ago. She went back\u2026 to Heavenspan Island.\u201d Bai Xiaochun currently held a jade slip of information in his hand. By now, he had some speculations regarding why Du Lingfei was the Heavenspan emissary.</p><br/><p>As soon as the idea popped into his head, he tried to suppress it. However, a strange expression gradually took over his face. After some more thought, he blinked a few times and then cleared his throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I\u2019m right\u2026 that would be terrifying.\u201d He rubbed his nose, then waved his hand to put the jade slip away. Now that he was a deva and prime elder, no secrets could be kept from him in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, except secrets protected by other devas with equal standing to himself.</p><br/><p>From that, it was possible to see how important he was now. He truly was an important person whom all disciples looked up to in awe.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was more than pleased by that, and would normally have taken time to strut around and bask in the adoring gazes of everyone in the sect.</p><br/><p>But right now, he wasn\u2019t in the mood for that. Despite having so many people come to visit him during the past three days, he still had not heard any news about Big Fatty Zhang and Xu Baocai.</p><br/><p>It was almost as if they had gone missing. Even Feng Youde was baffled by the situation. He only knew that both of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s friends had simply disappeared a year earlier.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun heard that, he immediately came to the conclusion that\u2026 a deva was behind the situation!</p><br/><p>Only people like that would qualify to do something like this and make sure he couldn\u2019t find any information about it.</p><br/><p>Both Big Fatty Zhang and Xu Baocai both had life slips in the River-Defying Sect, and therefore, he knew they were alive. But that didn\u2019t stop his anxiety from mounting. Sticking up his chin, he snorted coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I can\u2019t track them down. I\u2019ll just go visit Chen Hetian. Hmmmphh! From now on, if anyone bothers me, I\u2019ll take it out on him!\u201d Of the three devas, Chen Hetian was the one he disliked the most, feelings which stretched all the way back to the Wildlands and the Great Wall.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

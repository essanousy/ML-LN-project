Without the slightest hesitation, the entire group instantly transformed into beams of light that shot after it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m definitely going to earn the right to reach Foundation Establishment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI failed once, but I\u2019m not going to fail again. I'm going to reach Foundation Establishment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re allowed to kill people in this trial by fire, so anybody who tries to stop me from reaching Foundation Establishment will die!\u201d</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!</p><br/><p>Within the blink of an eye, all of the disciples disappeared into the pit, eyes bloodshot, ready to fight to the death.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was in the group, his eyes glued to the falling pill bottle. Once inside the pit, the blood qi inside of him surged, and he picked up speed. Almost instantly, he was in the front of the pack, along with three other disciples. Moments later, they had already reached the location of the pill bottle.</p><br/><p>Of course, Bai Xiaochun still couldn\u2019t use his Foundation Establishment cultivation base. If he did, a mere thought on his part could crush everyone else. But in the Blood Stream Sect, he had learned to exercise the utmost caution at all times, so he only used the power of the Qi Condensation stage. He also avoided using any of his magical techniques, to further avoid poking any holes in his disguise.</p><br/><p>In fact, due to his cultivation of the Undying Heavenly King, he had plenty of blood qi inside of him, making him seem no different from any of the other disciples.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun roared as he waved his right hand, unleashing blood qi in a powerful attack that spread out in all directions. The other three disciples in the area were forced to defend themselves, and as a result, slowed down significantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou got some good fortune in the Foundation Establishment Holy Land and hid it from us, didn\u2019t you!? You didn\u2019t reach Earthstring Foundation Establishment, but you still have power that exceeds the tenth level of Qi Condensation!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Nightcrypt hadn\u2019t slowed down at all, the other three immediately joined forces to attack him. The disciples further back didn\u2019t seem to have expected this to happen, and yet weren\u2019t surprised.</p><br/><p>Zhao Wuchang\u2019s eyes flashed as he came to the same conclusion as the other disciples, that Nightcrypt had come across some good fortune that gave him access to greater power than before.</p><br/><p>Even as Bai Xiaochun sped toward the pill bottle, he forced some blood to ooze out his mouth to make it looked like he was injured. At the same time, he put a crazed expression on his face. With one final burst, he closed the distance and grabbed the pill bottle. Any of the other disciples in this situation would have broken the bottle open, taken a few pills, then thrown the other ones off to the side to distract the rest of the disciples.</p><br/><p>In fact, that was what all of the other disciples assumed would happen.</p><br/><p>Even the four grand elders up on the Precipice of Never-Ending Blood also expected the same outcome. None of them were at all surprised to see Bai Xiaochun break ahead of the pack and grab the bottle. After all, most disciples of the Blood Stream Sect had various trump cards to call upon, so a burst of speed was nothing beyond expectation.</p><br/><p>As for the grand elder from Corpse Peak, he had met Nightcrypt before, and currently, his eyes shone with admiration. Of course, were it not for the events of a few months before, he wouldn\u2019t have paid much attention to Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>However, what happened next left all four grand elders completely shocked.</p><br/><p>Instead of breaking the pill bottle open, Bai Xiaochun picked up speed and headed further into the depths of the pit.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Nightcrypt?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s doing this!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt, are you looking to die?!?!\u201d Rumbling sounds could be heard as the enraged crowd chased Bai Xiaochun down into the depths.</p><br/><p>Even as the other disciples\u2019 killing intent soared, the four grand elders on the Precipice of Never-Ending Blood exchanged surprised looks. Then, their eyes began to gleam with keen interest.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe's hogging the pills?\u201d said the grand elder of Lesser Marsh Peak, a burly man with a booming voice. His expression was rather ferocious, and yet his eyes gleamed with admiration. \u201cHow bold! That\u2019s just the type of personality Blood Stream Sect disciples should have. I never paid much attention to this kid before. What a pity he didn\u2019t reach Earthstring Foundation Establishment, otherwise he would have become a major Chosen!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Junwan covered her mouth as she laughed, suddenly much more deeply impressed by Nightcrypt. \u201cVery interesting. Presumably, many of that group of thirty would love to hog the pills, but he\u2019s the first one to actually attempt to pull it off!\u201d</p><br/><p>The grand elder from Nameless Peak, the dwarf, chuckled darkly. \u201cHe's called Nightcrypt, right? What a good name, and what potential in a disciple. If he really manages to cut off the Foundation Establishment path for the rest of them, then I definitely want him for Nameless Peak.\u201d</p><br/><p>The grand elder from Corpse Peak laughed heartily. \u201cI remember this kid. He's a pure genius when it comes to refining corpses!\u201d</p><br/><p>He completely approved of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s actions.</p><br/><p>After the disciples disappeared into the depths, everyone turned to leave.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if that hogger Nightcrypt will still be alive a month from now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, I already said that if he reaches Foundation Establishment, I want him for Nameless Peak!\u201d Laughing and chatting, the four grand elders left.</p><br/><p>Down in the pit, Bai Xiaochun was racing along at top speed, intentionally causing blood to spray out of his mouth every once in awhile to remind everyone that he was injured. However, he didn\u2019t slow down even a bit. Soon he was down near the bottom of the pit, and upon looking around, he found that it really was like a tiny little world. There were mountains rising up in all directions, all of which were covered with blood-colored vegetation.</p><br/><p>Off in the distance were some volcanoes that radiated intense heat and powerful rumbling noises.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Bai Xiaochun could sense numerous dangerous and brutal auras rising up from various locations.</p><br/><p>Even as he hovered there feeling proud of himself, the other disciples began to arrive, bursting with murderous auras.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want to fight me over these Foundation Establishment Pills?\u201d he shouted. \u201cDream on!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt, it\u2019s not right to be so vicious! You can\u2019t cut off our path to Foundation Establishment!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you do such a thing. You\u2019re dead!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHumph! Offending this many people has earned you a death sentence! And don\u2019t even think about trying to hole up somewhere and reach Foundation Establishment! This place isn\u2019t very big, and I\u2019ve been here before, so I can definitely track you down!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t even look at them. As numerous magical techniques rumbled through the air toward him, he sped toward the region with the volcanoes. The Pit of Never-Ending Blood wasn\u2019t just used for Foundation Establishment trials by fire. Disciples would also come here on missions to harvest four-leaf clovers.</p><br/><p>However, when going out on missions, the sect would make sure that the area wasn\u2019t too dangerous. As long as one was careful, one wouldn\u2019t face any mortal danger. In fact, imposter Nightcrypt had even come here, and was relatively familiar with the area.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe four-leaf clovers are in the volcano region....\u201d Eyes glittering, Bai Xiaochun sped toward the nearest volcano and vanished into a tunnel without even pausing.</p><br/><p>Even as he did, the other disciples closed in, enraged, roiling with murderous auras as they chased after him.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun picked up speed as he flew through the countless passages and tunnels that riddled the ground underneath the volcano region. The area was almost like a huge maze.</p><br/><p>Because of that, none of the pursuers had any idea where exactly he was, which enraged them even more.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

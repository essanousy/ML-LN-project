Not one little bit. In my heart, you are as holy as a lotus, something the filth of the world can\u2019t even come close to touching. You are as beautiful as a sea immortal, completely beyond the sordid dirtiness of the world around you!\u201d As he got more emotional, the pain in his eyes grew more intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrand elder, allow me to tell you what kind of person you are in my heart. I dream of you night and day. You are an eternal safe haven for my soul, the ideal immortal goddess, something pure and sacred that I must protect for my whole life.\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s sorrow and despair was making him shake, and the disappointment he felt in his heart was turning into a madness that was exploding out as if it had been suppressed for far too long.</p><br/><p>He swished his sleeve, and a bit of a murderous aura began to emanate off of him, as if he couldn\u2019t suppress it any longer. It was as if he had climbed a mountain of corpses and waded through a sea of blood to get where he was. Even his veins of steel began to show through. \u201cI, Nightcrypt, can't even count how many people I've killed in my life. I am as vicious as they get. I\u2019ve lost touch with my humanity, with my feelings, with my passion. I am like an empty shell filled with nothing but the coldness of slaughter and brutality. However, in the emptiness, there is a spark of light. And that light sparked into being when I first laid eyes on you, grand elder.\u201d</p><br/><p>A tremor ran through Song Junwan\u2019s beautiful frame. She almost seemed to be in a daze as she stared at the disappointment in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes. There was pain and grief there, as if something beautiful and holy which he had been completely attached to... had collapsed. It was as if his entire world had fallen apart, and he was now descending into hysteria.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t choose Middle Peak, Grand Elder, I chose... you!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou talk about my lewd stare, but you are mistaken. I have never looked at you in such a way. Every time I look at you, I just want to protect you....\u201d</p><br/><p>By this point, his bloodshot eyes overflowed with pain as he shouted, \u201cGrand elder, the person standing in front of me right now is not you!!</p><br/><p>\u201cPut on your clothes! Get that look off your face! Enough with the flirting. I want to see the pure and unsullied Song Junwan that exists in my heart, the person that I, Nightcrypt, wish to protect for my whole life. Return to me that which is the light of my life....\u201d From Bai Xiaochun\u2019s twisted expression, he almost seemed to be going insane. His roaring voice echoed about in the immortal's cave, causing the hot spring waters to vibrate. It almost seemed as if he were giving vent to his deepest emotions.</p><br/><p>Imposter Nightcrypt\u2019s soul was shaken as he observed the actions of Bai Xiaochun, stupefied by how realistic his wording was, and how his emotions seemed so real.</p><br/><p>The immortal's cave was quiet for a moment, but then Bai Xiaochun began to chuckle hoarsely. Sounding disappointed and hurt, he quietly turned away so that he wasn\u2019t looking at Song Junwan.</p><br/><p>He was trembling, although the truth was that it was from fear. As soon as he had stepped into the immortal's cave, he had sensed the intangible coldness inside, and he realized that nothing he had planned on the way over would work.</p><br/><p>He could only improvise. As soon as Song Junwan emerged from the water, he knew that he had to exercise utmost caution, lest he be finished.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis stinking shrew is completely nefarious!\u201d Bai Xiaochun really felt as if he\u2019d gotten the short end of the stick. How could he ever have imagined that Song Junwan would be so vicious? Clearly she knew that the patriarchs liked him, and that he was also very famous in the sect. That was why she had chosen to use such tactics on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt's a good thing Bai Xiaochun is no fool!\u201d he thought. \u201cLet\u2019s see what trick she pulls next!\u201d Remaining completely vigilant, he waited for Song Junwan to make her next move.</p><br/><p>Song Junwan\u2019s mind was spinning, and she was trembling visibly. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words had stabbed deep into her heart, like the sharpest of blades. Now that she stood there looking at his back, he seemed taller than ever, as though he could support heaven and earth on his shoulders.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t even sure what to say. Nightcrypt had completely shaken her to the core. It felt like a mountain had fallen onto her, something that broke down all the barriers in her mind and left her soul exposed.</p><br/><p>She could only stand there quietly trying to calm the chaos in her heart. Her original intention had been to call Nightcrypt over to try to find a reason to punish him. If she could lock him up in Blood Prison, then she could definitely stop any gossip from spreading. Furthermore, it would make it impossible for Xuemei to kill him, which would mean that she would have won the competition between the two of them.</p><br/><p>Who would have ever thought that the seemingly lewd Nightcrypt would fall to pieces because of her clothing and her actions? She was especially moved by his last words, when he asked her to bring back the real Song Junwan. That left her thoroughly moved, and suddenly caused something different to appear in her eyes when she looked at him.</p><br/><p>Song Junwan took a deep breath. Slowly, the flirtatious expression she usually wore faded away. She waved her hand, and a more conservative garment flew over and settled onto her. She adjusted her hair and straightened up a bit, and suddenly seemed very different. Instead of looking seductive, she seemed truly dignified and beautiful.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t very old to begin with, but with this attire, she seemed completely different than before. Inside and out, she radiated a natural grace and charm that made her seem dazzling.</p><br/><p>Her skin was fair and white, and without all the makeup, she seemed like clouds reflected on snow. Her hair was now coiled together into a beautiful bun, and as she looked at Bai Xiaochun, her eyes glistened like deep pools of pure water.</p><br/><p>Her teeth were smooth and white, her lips plump and red. Anyone who looked at her would think they were seeing the beauty of humanity personified.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can turn around now,\u201d she said softly.</p><br/><p>Remaining ever vigilant, Bai Xiaochun slowly turned around, making sure to keep the disappointed expression on his face. At the same time, his veins of steel were visible as he laid eyes on Song Junwan.</p><br/><p>Almost immediately, he was shaken to the core. He had seen beautiful women before, such as Hou Xiaomei, Zhou Xinqi, or the missing Du Lingfei. They were all exquisitely good-looking. However, there was something graceful and elegant to Song Junwan that few women could compare to.</p><br/><p>Her previous flirtatious look had turned into something very dignified, and the change left Bai Xiaochun completely taken aback.</p><br/><p>It was a pure, clean beauty, like a hibiscus flower glistening in the morning dew. Completely and utterly astonishing.</p><br/><p>Despite being completely tongue-tied and anxious, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s vigilance didn\u2019t reduce in the slightest. On the contrary, it grew stronger. \u201cThis Song Junwan, she\u2019s... she's the ultimate vixen!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing Bai Xiaochun\u2019s reaction, Song Junwan covered her smile with her hand. There was nothing coquettish about it this time. It was actually very charming, and the look in her eyes caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart to leap.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat's she doing now!?!\u201d he thought, so nervous that his heart was pounding in his chest. For some reason, this latest tactic of hers seemed far more powerful than her opening move. Presumably, she would be making her counterattack at any moment. Was she moving in for the kill?</p><br/><p>She smiled charmingly, and before he could respond, she continued on in a serious voice, \u201cVery well, I\u2019m giving you back the Song Junwan that exists in your heart. Happy now?</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason I asked you here was to tell you something. Go back and pack your bags. We\u2019ll meet tomorrow at dawn, at the base of Middle Peak. You\u2019ll be joining me as I go with one of my Song Clan's patriarchs to visit the Spirit Stream Sect!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat Song Clan patriarch is also one of the eight patriarchs of the Blood Stream Sect!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes went wide, and when he heard her mention the Spirit Stream Sect, his heart trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cA diplomatic mission to the Spirit Stream Sect?\u201d Bai Xiaochun was taken aback. The idea of going back to the Spirit Stream Sect as Nightcrypt was strange to say the least.</p><br/><p>Song Junwan looked at him and smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong. You don\u2019t want to go? I didn\u2019t originally plan to take you. However, if I leave you behind, that slut Xuemei might cause problems. Since I can\u2019t stay to protect you, then I\u2019d prefer to take you with me.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to be very careful whenever you see that whore. She\u2019s ruthless, and also reached nine Earthstring Tideflows. Her father is Patriarch Limitless, and she herself is a potential future matriarch of the sect. There\u2019s nothing she won't do to reach her goals.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe and I have never gotten along. The slut thinks that she can rely on her status to steal my rightful spot as blood master of Middle Peak. But how could I possibly let her do such a thing!?\u201d Almost as soon as Song Junwan mentioned Xuemei, her eyes flickered with cold light. However, seemingly worried that such a look wouldn\u2019t conform with Bai Xiaochun\u2019s image of her, she suddenly felt the need to explain further.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom generation to generation, there have always been four blood masters. By now, the blood masters of the other three mountain peaks have already been selected. Only Middle Peak has none. Blood master is a very high position, similar to that of prime elder. After reaching Core Formation, blood masters become blood rippers, which are second only to the patriarchs. Of course, in order to become a blood ripper, you have to first become a blood master!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe position of Middle Peak blood master has belonged to the Song Clan for many, many years. But this time, Xuemei reached nine Tideflows, and thinks she can steal it away.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I fail, then the Song Clan\u2019s power will weaken in the sect, and I can't let that happen.\u201d Having finished her explanation, Song Junwan looked at Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath. Then, after a moment of thought, he asked, \u201cWhy exactly are we going to the Spirit Stream Sect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Junwan hesitated for a moment. Before what had just happened, she would never have divulged the secret. But now, after a moment of thought, she waved her hand, activating her cave\u2019s spell formation, and sealing the two of them in alone. Then she began to explain.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

No matter how either of them had considered the matter, they could never have guessed that the preeminently proud Zhao Tianjiao would say something like that upon entering Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cabin.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t the only ones to be completely taken aback: Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s two followers were also struck with shock.</p><br/><p>That was especially true considering that the compensation Zhao Tianjiao was offering was a deva beast soul. All four of the other cultivators present were completely flabbergasted by that; back at the sect, a deva beast soul could be traded for a Nascent Soul Pill, which showed how incredibly valuable they were.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun sat there cross-legged, not even having bothered to rise to his feet. In fact, he was actually frowning in displeasure.</p><br/><p>Then he snorted coldly, flicked his sleeve and angrily said, \u201cElder Brother Zhao, you and I got along with each other at first sight, and it was the sincerity of your request that convinced me to help you. And yet here you go and offer compensation? Do you really think that I, Bai Xiaochun, am the kind of person who cares about compensation from you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Face turning even more grim, he continued, \u201cDeva beast soul...? Hmph! If I want one of those, I\u2019ll get it myself. You may leave now, Elder Brother Zhao. See yourself out!\u201d</p><br/><p>Master God-Diviner and Song Que suddenly found it hard to breathe, and Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s two followers\u2019 jaws dropped. As for the latter, they had never heard anyone in the current generation of disciples speak to Zhao Tianjiao in such a way. Just as they were about to step forward and berate Bai Xiaochun, Zhao Tianjiao raised his hand to stop them.</p><br/><p>Giving Bai Xiaochun a deep look, he suddenly smiled, which was something he very rarely did.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow foolish of me, my brother. Please don\u2019t be angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sincerity of his smile and his words caused the hearts of his two followers to begin to pound even harder. They had been followers of Zhao Tianjiao for a very long time, and had never once seen him smile. Not only was that shocking in and of itself, but it also made them even more terrified of Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Laughing heartily, Bai Xiaochun rose to his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Brother, the truth is that I\u2019m just trying to get the best you have to offer. You see, the reason I want to help you is not because I want to make a quick profit, but rather, because I seek long-term compensation. And that compensation is none other than your friendship!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was of the opinion that the words he had spoken were particularly impressive, and was feeling quite proud of himself for coming up with them.</p><br/><p>Master God-Diviner and Song Que exchanged a glance, and even Zhao Tianjiao seemed surprised. But then, Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s smile grew even more sincere than before. Shaking his head, he sat down in front of Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm in love with Chen Yueshan, Xiaochun. What am I supposed to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun sat down, placing a flagon of spirit alcohol down between them as he did. Master God-Diviner, being as quick-witted as he was, quickly took it upon himself to serve them. Bai Xiaochun lifted his cup and took a sip, his eyes glittering faintly.</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao didn\u2019t rush him. Taking a sip of his own alcohol, he sat there waiting for Bai Xiaochun to speak.</p><br/><p>It took Bai Xiaochun a moment to organize his thoughts, after which, he began to speak, his expression placid, but seemingly profound, like someone who had long since achieved the Dao.</p><br/><p>\u201cLove is a complex and ever-changing thing, like an entire world of interlocking thoughts and emotions. It's not common for people to be able to see things clearly when it comes to love, especially considering how many things affect it. Consider: one\u2019s personality, one\u2019s actions, one\u2019s status, and one\u2019s other relationships all play a part, as well as sundry other factors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Placing his drinking vessel down, he slowly continued, \u201cLoving someone is a simple thing. However, getting that person to love you back is a skill unto itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cUpon first entering the cultivation world, I did not shrink back from that tribulation called love, and in fact, dominated the field for decades. I received 37,931 love letters, and won the hearts of tens of thousands of young women. I\u2019ve seen many instances of love, and seen many beautiful women age and fall by the wayside. Although I can\u2019t say that I understand everything about the topic, based on what I've experienced, I can claim to have learned a bit.\u201d Waving his sleeve, he stuck his chin up, and from the look in his eye, he seemed to have many profound thoughts running through his head.</p><br/><p>Master God-Diviner\u2019s eyes went even wider than before, and as for Song Que, his lips curled with a bit of scorn. The two of them exchanged a look, and both could see how much the other was scoffing at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s blatant, showy display.</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao coughed dryly, and was about to say something when Bai Xiaochun suddenly gave him a piercing look.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat I am about to explain now is a secret that took me half a lifetime to perfect. Anyone who masters this secret will have the power to shake heaven and earth, and even cause signs to appear in the sky. Were it to fall into the wrong hands, wicked hands, it would lead to countless young women being struck witless with terror, and likely, plunged into an abyss of misery.... Therefore, all of you must remember that this is a secret which cannot be spread beyond this room!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe field of love is like the field of battle. In battle, you seek victory, and in love, you seek to win the heart of the person you love!</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, I, Bai Xiaochun, have taken everything I have learned in life, and combined it all into a single character. <em>Win!</em>\u201d As he spoke, his voice grew louder, and seemed to surge with intensity.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen you break apart the character win  into all its smaller elements, you get  death,  mouth,  moon,  shell-money,  and mortal! \u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cThe death character represents an awareness of deadly crisis. The mouth character represents the power to communicate properly. The moon character represents how important timing and the environment are. The shell-money character represents how important spirit stones are. The mortal character represents how you must always keep your mortal heart calm and peaceful, especially in critical moments.\u201d</p><br/><p>Upon hearing these words, Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s expression flickered.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one to react in such a way. Master God-Diviner couldn\u2019t keep his expression calm, and Song Que\u2019s mind began to spin with numerous thoughts. Even Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s two followers gasped, as though they had just received important enlightenment.</p><br/><p>Never before in their lives had they heard words spoken like this, and the more they thought about them... the more they made sense!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the summary of all the insight of Love Saint Bai Xiaochun... my secret method, the Win Charm!\u201d To emphasize his words, Bai Xiaochun slapped his hand down onto the ground, the sound of which echoed into the minds of everyone present, leaving them utterly shaken.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis....\u201d Master God-Diviner looked in shock at Bai Xiaochun, his mind filled with thoughts of the Win Charm.</p><br/><p>Song Que was gaping in disbelief, trying to figure out how Bai Xiaochun could possibly have come up with something like this....</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao lost control of his breathing for a moment before calming down. As of this moment, he was completely convinced that Bai Xiaochun knew what he was talking about. He really was like a deva, and his Win Charm left Zhao Tianjiao feeling as if he had been struck by lightning. Suddenly, whole new worlds of possibility had opened up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy took the battlefield that is love,\u201d he thought, \u201cand all the techniques and skills involved with it, and bound them together into a single character.... Just how profoundly skilled is he?\u201d Zhao Tianjiao couldn\u2019t stop from rising to his feet, clasping hands, and bowing deeply to Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked completely and utterly calm. Furthermore, at some unknown point, he had produced a fan, which he slowly swished through the air as he gazed around with an enigmatic smile on his face.</p><br/><p>The truth was that Bai Xiaochun hadn't come up with the Win Charm on his own. He had received quite a bit of help from imposter Nightcrypt. After all, back in the Blood Stream Sect, imposter Nightcrypt had gained a lot of experience in the love department.... Although all of his experiences had left him shedding proverbial tears of blood, were it not for his special techniques, neither he nor anyone else in his position could ever have accomplished what he had.</p><br/><p>A profound look appeared in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes as he slowly said, \u201cThe Win Charm is just an overview, which I have explained to you today so that you can understand how the field of love is just like the field of battle!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd now, I will give a more detailed explanation of the essence of the Win Charm!</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath, mouth, moon, shell-money, mortal. The first aspect is the death character, which represents an awareness of deadly crisis. You need to be prepared for dangerous threats at any moment, and must always remind yourself that a crisis might be around the next corner!</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter all, Elder Sister Chen is a natural born beauty with spectacular latent talent. You can\u2019t just simply think of her as a young woman with no Daoist partner. Obviously, there are many, many other disciples in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect who secretly have a crush on her, so many that you have no way of knowing how many there are!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, forget about the sect as a whole. Even on this very ship, there are surely many disciples who are already in love with her, so if you ignore that sensation of crisis now, then you have already met defeat!\u201d To Zhao Tianjiao, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words felt like a fist punching him in the face. Moments ago, he had felt as if he suddenly understood things more, but now he was left shaking in fear. The truth was that he truly did care about Chen Yueshan, but because of his personality, found it impossible to express himself directly. He didn't even know how to <em>try</em> to woo her. Therefore, when he had seen how easily Bai Xiaochun seemed to handle women, he had come to him for advice.</p><br/><p>First, he had been shaken by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s love letters, and then came the shocking Win Charm. By now, he had complete and utter faith, and couldn\u2019t wait to hear what was coming next.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, what am I supposed to do?!?!\u201d he asked anxiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said sincerely, \u201cI\u2019m not finished yet. Although you must always foster that sense of crisis, you mustn\u2019t let it show on your face. Keep it alive in your heart only. That way... you will always understand that time is limited!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao took a deep breath to calm himself down.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes twinkled with approval. Nodding his head, he continued, \u201cVery good. Now, let\u2019s move on to the mouth character, which represents communication and interaction. You say you love Elder Sister Chen, therefore, I won\u2019t even wait for your response to the next issue. Have you told her about your feelings, or done anything to act on them? Obviously not, and that\u2019s fine. You don\u2019t want to be too hasty about such matters. However, you need to find more opportunities to interact with her, and when you do, you must be charming and witty. That\u2019s very important. And don\u2019t worry about what exactly to say. I\u2019ll teach you everything.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

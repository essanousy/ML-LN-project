Neither did it emit fluctuations that would be noticed by anyone else.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 it did exert massive force on Bai Xiaochun, so much so that it felt as if his soul and cultivation base would be ripped out of him!</p><br/><p>He could struggle against it, and perhaps escape, but in the process, his soul would be torn away from him and swallowed up by the rift!</p><br/><p>To Bai Xiaochun\u2019s horror, he found that it was the same with his cultivation base, and even his blood. In fact, as he struggled, blood began to ooze out of his pores and fly through the air toward the rift.</p><br/><p>It seemed like he might be torn to pieces at any moment. At the same time, though, the sinister, female voice continued to speak into his ear, describing what she clearly envisioned to be a most wonderful image.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy all means, keep struggling. That will make it easier for me to absorb your divine soul, and your blood\u2026 and eventually, the only thing left behind will be a skeleton\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cSave me some effort. Help me turn you into a most delectable feast\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun screamed inwardly as he suddenly visualized\u2026 himself, with his divine soul sucked away, his cultivation base gone, bereft of blood, flesh, internal organs, and even his head\u2026. The only thing left behind was a skeleton which crashed down onto the ground, held in place only because it was made of Undying Bones\u2026.</p><br/><p>Years later, a passerby would be overjoyed to find such a precious treasure, and would turn his skeleton into medicinal pills, or a magical item, or perhaps even a skeleton puppet\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cNooo\u2026.\u201d Slowly, his mind went blank because of the intense gravitational force. Soon, the power reached a point that defied imagination, and in despair, he stopped struggling. At that point, he became of streak of bright light that shot into the rift.</p><br/><p>With Bai Xiaochun gone, the rift closed up and disappeared. The entire time, nobody noticed what had occurred, neither Du Lingfei nor the young man with her, both of whom were trying to break through the shield of light in the desert.</p><br/><p>Also near that shield was Hou Xiaomei, her eyes gleaming with anticipation, but her brow slightly furrowed as she looked off in the direction of the swamp. A moment later, the shield in the desert trembled as though it might collapse, and Hou Xiaomei looked over at it, the anticipation in her eyes growing more intense.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt long last\u2026 I can return\u2026. I wouldn\u2019t be doing this unless there were no other choice, Ghostmother\u2026. I very much look forward to the joy on your face when you see me again\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the shield shook violently back in the desert, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s vision was finally growing clear, revealing a very familiar scene\u2026.</p><br/><p>He was in a room that looked very much like a lady\u2019s bedchamber\u2026.</p><br/><p>There was a bed covered in dust and cobwebs, a vanity, and a cracked mirror\u2026.</p><br/><p>A scream escaped his lips, and he spun to leave, only to find that there was no exit in sight\u2026.</p><br/><p>Seated at the vanity was a woman in a long, red gown. Her back was to him as she combed her hair and softly sang that familiar, spine-tingling song\u2026.</p><br/><p>Tears of terror threatened to spill out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I do, what do I do\u2026!?\u201d he thought. He felt like his scalp was about to explode, and wished for nothing more than to escape. And yet, there didn\u2019t seem to be any way to do that. Without any hesitation, he pulled out the gravekeeper\u2019s command medallion and gripped it tight in his hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t eat me, Big Sis\u2026.\u201d he blurted in a quavering voice. Not quite sure of what to say, he began to babble a bit. \u201cUh\u2026 do you know the gravekeeper? He\u2019s my Master! You and I are probably on the same team\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, right. There are some people outside who mean you harm, Big Sis. Why don\u2019t you go check the situation out? No need to worry about me\u2026. I didn't want to come here. You\u2026 you dragged me here, Big Sis\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was at this point that the woman\u2019s shoulder moved, as though she were about to turn and look at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look back!\u201d he shrieked. \u201cJust\u2026 don't look back. If you have anything to say, you can--\u201d</p><br/><p>In the middle of his sentence, the woman stopped singing. Continuing to comb her hair, she quietly said, \u201cThis <em>is</em> your first time here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d he replied. Then, he began to nod his head vigorously. \u201cUm, if you say it\u2019s my first time here, Big Sis, then of course it\u2019s my first time\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019re here,\u201d the woman said, her voice undulating in bizarre fashion, \u201cI can\u2019t help but wonder what you\u2019re thinking about as you stand there\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>A look of confused surprise appeared on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face. \u201cWait, first time? No, this is my <em>second</em> time. And you\u2019re the one who brought me here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNobody brought you here\u2026. And your two friends are still right above us.\u201d She waved her finger at the mirror, causing an image of the bone galleon\u2019s deck 2 to appear. There, Song Que and Master God-Diviner stood on either side of the rocking chair, completely unmoving, blank looks on their faces.</p><br/><p>The image, combined with the woman\u2019s words, struck Bai Xiaochun like a thunderbolt, causing him to gasp.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible! How could this be happening\u2026? I left this place. I went back to the River-Defying Sect. I went back to the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect. I\u2026 I was in a trial by fire. That\u2019s how I got here\u2026.\u201d Not only did he not trust the woman\u2019s words, he refused to believe that everything that had happened after he left the bone galleon, including the events in the River-Defying Sect and the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, were all mere fantasies\u2026.</p><br/><p>And yet, there was something strange about the woman\u2019s voice which made it almost impossible to control his mind, and forced him to start thinking about the past.</p><br/><p>As he did that, he unknowingly began to relax his grip on the command medallion\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou never left\u2026.\u201d the woman continued in her bizarre voice. Her shoulder trembled, and she slowly began to turn her head. However, she didn't stop combing her hair. In fact, she started combing it faster and faster\u2026.</p><br/><p>She almost seemed to want to rip the hair out of her head! It was a bizarre scene that left Bai Xiaochun feeling profoundly shocked, but at the same time, somewhat blank.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnyone who looks at my face will descend into a fantasy of their own making\u2026. This really is your first time here. However, it is not your first time\u2026 seeing my face.\u201d As she spoke, her head continued to turn. Within moments\u2026 she would be facing him directly!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face was completely blank, and he was shivering. As he descended into chaotic memories, his grip on the command medallion loosened!</p><br/><p>The command medallion dropped to the ground, and the woman turned completely around! Her face was featureless, to the point where it almost looked like a blank sheet of white paper!!</p><br/><p>But then a slit spread out on her face, which opened into something like a bizarre mouth. Then she lunged toward Bai Xiaochun as if to swallow him.</p><br/><p>In that moment\u2026 Bai Xiaochun suddenly stooped down and picked up the command medallion. When he looked up, his expression wasn\u2019t blank at all, and he was shoving the command medallion out toward the mouth!</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you're scared of this thing, let\u2019s see if you dare to eat it!\u201d Everything from moments before had been an act! He had decided to throw caution to the wind and create an opportunity for himself!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

I'm the perfect example. The sect leadership was so worried about how outstanding I am that they exempted me from doing missions for ten years, but will still send me merit points every month.\u201d He sat there, reveling a bit in being able to worry about things like this, and wondering what he was supposed to do considering that he was so outstanding....</p><br/><p>\u201cAh well, I guess it doesn\u2019t matter. Since I can\u2019t go out on missions, I might as well concoct medicine. After all, the reason I was doing the missions in the first place was to get merit points.\u201d With such thoughts on his mind, Bai Xiaochun resigned himself to sacrificing his own benefit for the betterment of the sect, and walked over to his medicine concocting workstation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to master all of the concocting methods for tier-3 spirit medicines!\u201d With that, his expression turned somber.</p><br/><p>Time passed. Half a year.</p><br/><p>Other than his routine cultivation, he spent all of his time concocting medicine. When he lacked ingredients, he cashed in merit points. As time went on, he grew more frenzied, apparently unwilling to slow down until he had mastered everything to do with tier-3 spirit medicines.</p><br/><p>Because he wasn\u2019t out doing missions, the sect slowly returned to normal. Many people sighed in relief, especially Sect Leader Zheng Yuandong, who was finally able to feel at ease inwardly. By now, he was sure that exempting Bai Xiaochun from mission duty had been the right thing to do.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one. Li Qinghou, as well as the other south bank peak lords and elders, all felt much more at ease. In fact, at one of the regular south bank council meetings, the Foundation Establishment cultivators happened to bring up the matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun has been focused on concocting medicine lately. The sect has really calmed down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMedicine concocting is a good thing. Have him keep practicing. It's the safest option, anyway. With him focused on that, he won\u2019t be causing problems for people outside.\u201d The entire group was all smiles; the past half year of peace and quiet left them all sighing happily.</p><br/><p>And yet, just days after their meeting, a massive explosion echoed out on Fragrant Cloud Peak. It came from the direction of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s immortal's cave, and caused everything in the area to tremble violently. Numerous Inner Sect disciples were badly startled, and the Outer Sect disciples were left trembling in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat just happened?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! Could the Spirit Stream Sect be under attack!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As everyone devolved into a commotion, Bai Xiaochun lurched out of his medicine concocting workstation, coughing, face tinged with ash, nose running and tears streaming down his face. He quickly washed off in the hot spring, and then frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did it explode?\u201d he thought. The pill furnaces provided to Inner Sect disciples were all standard issue, exactly the same as the ones in the Medicine Concocting Pavilion. Generally speaking, even if the spirit medicine was concocted incorrectly, they wouldn\u2019t just explode.\u00a0</p><br/><p>And yet, that was exactly what had just happened. It had even activated the cave\u2019s defensive spell formations.</p><br/><p>After pondering the matter at length, he couldn't come up with an explanation. Sighing, he went back to cultivating the Dragon Mammoth Sea-Forming Scripture for a few days. By this point, his cultivation was only a sliver away from a breakthrough.</p><br/><p>However, he wasn\u2019t in any hurry. After finishing his cultivation, he consumed some spirit medicine to replenish his vital energy, then set to work on the Undying Live Forever Technique. The silver light which rose up from his skin was now so dark that it bordered on golden.</p><br/><p>That afternoon, Bai Xiaochun went on to the next task at hand. Standing there in his immortal's cave, he slowly lifted his hands up into the air as he practiced the Waterswamp Kingdom mnemonic. After enough time passed for half an incense stick to burn, he opened his eyes and let out a powerful shout.</p><br/><p>An intense energy exploded out from inside him, causing everything around him to suddenly change. A field of water vapor appeared, which lasted for only a single breath of time before vanishing.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun sagged in place, wiping the sweat from his brow. Despite practicing the Waterswamp Kingdom every day since he\u2019d acquired it, that was all that he could accomplish.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to keep working harder!\u201d he thought. After resting for a moment, he ended his daily cultivation routine and once again pondered the problem of the exploding pill furnace. During the past half a year of practice, he had succeeded with a few tier-3 spirit medicines, but for the most part, his attempts had ended in failure.</p><br/><p>He sat there in frustration for some time before finally coming up with a theory.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaybe after the medicinal strength intensified to a certain point, it became unstable, which caused the explosion?\u201d Immediately afterward, he hurried out and exchanged some merit points for another pill furnace, then went back to concocting.</p><br/><p>Gradually, word spread that the explosion earlier had come from Bai Xiaochun\u2019s immortal's cave. Strange expressions appeared on the faces of the disciples. Although they weren\u2019t sure exactly what had caused the explosion, at least they now knew Bai Xiaochun was the cause.</p><br/><p>Then.... A few days later, Bai Xiaochun was there in his medicine concocting workstation, completely and utterly focused on controlling the spirit medicine inside the pill furnace. Unfortunately, tier-3 spirit medicines were extremely difficult to work with. Most other people, with enough experience and luck, would succeed three times out of ten and consider it a high rate of success. But Bai Xiaochun wanted things to be perfect. He wouldn\u2019t rest until he\u2019d solved each and every problem. Because he wanted even the tiniest details to be perfect, it meant he had to test all those details multiple times before finally resolving every issue.</p><br/><p>This time, his eyes went wide as he realized that he was losing control of the spirit medicine. Then the pill furnace began to issue cracking sounds. Bai Xiaochun gasped, and two wings suddenly appeared behind him as he bolted out of the medicine concocting workshop.</p><br/><p>Moments after he emerged, a huge explosion shook the immortal\u2019s cave.</p><br/><p>Fragrant Cloud Peak was once again thrown into an uproar for some time before everyone managed to calm down. Three days later, Bai Xiaochun ran screaming out of his medicine concocting workstation, and a third shocking explosion ripped through the air.</p><br/><p>After seven days, he emerged yet again, flustered, fleeing at top speed as a fourth deafening explosion nearly destroyed his medicine concocting workstation.</p><br/><p>Fragrant Cloud Peak was in utter chaos, and countless disciples\u2019 eyes were completely bloodshot. After inquiries were made, people learned that Bai Xiaochun was concocting medicine. However, no one could figure out exactly why such huge explosions would be occurring.</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked the Spirit Medicine Pharmacy, and they said that he recently purchased eight pill furnaces!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat sound must be an exploding pill furnace. Just what is Bai Xiaochun concocting? Dammit! Isn\u2019t he worried about blowing himself up!?\u201d Anger was building, and yet the explosions... weren\u2019t over. They continued.</p><br/><p>Over the course of the following month, seven explosions rocked Bai Xiaochun\u2019s immortal's cave, each one more intense than the last. The final explosion actually caused all of Fragrant Cloud Peak to tremble, and Bai Xiaochun\u2019s entire immortal's cave was nearly destroyed.</p><br/><p>As Bai Xiaochun fled outside, trembling in fear, the Outer and Inner Sect disciples of Fragrant Cloud Peak were driven to near madness. During the past month, none of them had been able to safely focus on practicing cultivation. Constantly being startled by the explosions had left them jumpy with fear. Now, they were thoroughly distracted, their eyes bloodshot as they struggled to control their anger.</p><br/><p>Apparently, even sound-muffling spell formations couldn\u2019t stop the sound of the explosions. The disciples\u2019 rage grew, and even the elders were shocked and could hardly believe what Bai Xiaochun was doing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is Bai Xiaochun concocting to cause the pill furnaces to explode like that? What... what medicine is he working on?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Things didn't end. Over the next month, the frequency of the explosions increased. More than a dozen occurred, almost every other day. Eventually, the Fragrant Cloud Peak disciples couldn\u2019t take it any longer, and stormed to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s immortal's cave en masse to vent their fury.</p><br/><p>Feeling very wronged, Bai Xiaochun hurried out to offer an explanation. When he saw a mob of over a thousand disciples, his face paled a bit, and eventually he resorted to slapping his chest and guaranteeing that there would be no more explosions. Only then did the crowd begin to calm down.</p><br/><p>After seeing everyone off, Bai Xiaochun went back into his immortal's cave, scowling the entire time. Looking over his mostly-destroyed medicine concocting workstation, he sighed, pulled out another pill furnace, and looked at it blankly.</p><br/><p>A few days later, he slapped his thigh, and his eyes began to shine.</p><br/><p>\u201cRight! It\u2019s definitely because I didn\u2019t pre-heat the pill furnace properly!\u201d Excited, he started concocting again.... Three days later, in the middle of the night, everyone on Fragrant Cloud Peak... heard a massive explosion.</p><br/><p>One Inner Sect disciple was so badly frightened that he almost fainted. Hair in complete disarray, he screamed, \u201cBai Xiaochun!! I don't care if you\u2019re Chosen, I'm going to beat you black and blue!\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one. Soon, all of the Inner Sect disciples had emerged from their immortal's caves, even the exhausted Zhou Xinqi. Bai Xiaochun hurried out, smiling apologetically as he guaranteed that it wouldn\u2019t happen again. The gathered disciples calmed down a bit in response. They couldn\u2019t find any fault with his attitude, and as such, had no other recourse. If he had been even a bit defiant, they definitely would have given him a good thrashing. But at the moment... they could only grit their teeth and accept his promise.</p><br/><p>Exhausted, Bai Xiaochun returned to his immortal's cave, wishing to cry but finding no tears. He was coming to find that it was a difficult thing to pursue his dreams.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm not the kind of person who gives up!\u201d he thought. Gritting his teeth, he produced another pill furnace, which he studied for half a month straight. Finally, after analyzing all aspects of the situation, he was sure that he had identified the problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarthflame. It\u2019s definitely the earthflame!\u201d Eyes bloodshot, he once again began to concoct.... Five days later at dawn, an explosion could be heard that was so loud it startled Li Qinghou, and could even be heard on Violet Cauldron Peak and Green Crest Peak.</p><br/><p>The Inner Sect disciples who lived near Bai Xiaochun\u2019s immortal's cave were dumbstruck, especially Zhou Xinqi. All of them felt like they were going crazy. Elder Zhou\u2019s birds let out high-pitched shrieks, and were so frightened that their feathers fell out. The spirit tail chickens were trembling and frothing at the mouth, and numerous Inner Sect disciples struggled to remain conscious....</p><br/><p>All of the spell formations in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cave activated as the earthflame erupted, and even Fragrant Cloud Peak\u2019s grand spell formation was affected. When Bai Xiaochun crawled out of the rubble, he was pitch black, and yet clearly excited. He was now sure that he had finally found the source of the problem.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t the earthflame, it was the techniques of mutual augmentation and suppression! They cause an unforeseeable variable. Tier-3 spirit medicines... must be concocted with mutual augmentation and suppression in mind!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone on Fragrant Cloud Peak, from the elders to the Outer Sect disciples, rushed over toward Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cave, enraged, rocks in hand to pelt him if necessary. When faced with such a furious mob, Bai Xiaochun vigorously slapped his chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guarantee--\u201d However, before he could finish, the crowd began to hurl their rocks. After all, fighting with magic against a fellow sect member was prohibited, but throwing rocks wasn\u2019t....</p><br/><p>\u201cGuarantee your ass!\u201d Countless rocks closed in, fueled by burning rage.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

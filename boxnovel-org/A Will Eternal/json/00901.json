Back at the Great Wall, Chen Hetian had acted with utter impunity. Completely ignoring how important Bai Xiaochun was, he had sent him into that labyrinth, and yet, that was not the end of his persecution. He then went on to oppress the River-Defying Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmmphh! Alright, Chen Hetian, this isn\u2019t me looking for revenge, it\u2019s you being an intolerable bully. The matter\u2019s set. When anyone bothers me, I\u2019ll take it out on Chen Hetian!\u201d Swishing his sleeve, he marveled at how important of a figure he was now.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t find Big Fatty Zhang, so I\u2019ll take it out on Chen Hetian!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf someone thinks about trifling with the River-Defying Sect, I\u2019ll take it out on Chen Hetian!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf someone looks at me the wrong way, I\u2019ll take it out on Chen Hetian!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf someone plots against me, I\u2019ll take it out on Chen Hetian!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was convinced that he was so marvelous, no one would ever truly be able to comprehend the full extent of it.</p><br/><p>That was especially true when he pondered how Chen Hetian would probably go crazy after what he was about to do. He chuckled excitedly.</p><br/><p>And the truth was that was exactly how things would play out. Although he couldn\u2019t kill Chen Hetian, his plan of venting his anger on him if anyone caused problems for him would drive the man crazy.</p><br/><p>Although Chen Hetian was in the mid Deva Realm, in terms of battle prowess, he didn\u2019t match up to Bai Xiaochun at all. The fact that Bai Xiaochun had single-handedly fought five devas, killing two and seriously injuring three, left Chen Hetian completely struck with fear.</p><br/><p>Were that not the case, he wouldn\u2019t have gone into secluded meditation after returning from the River-Defying Sect. And it was the same with Bai Zhentian and Li Xiandao.</p><br/><p>And yet, Chen Hetian clearly didn\u2019t understand how Bai Xiaochun operated\u2026. Never in his wildest dreams could he have imagined that going into hiding wouldn\u2019t stop Bai Xiaochun from coming to cause problems\u2026.</p><br/><p>With the swish of a sleeve, Bai Xiaochun shot across the rainbow toward Chen Hetian\u2019s residence.</p><br/><p>Chen Hetian had a sprawling, luxurious estate in the south of the blue rainbow district. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t live there alone; he had quite a few members of his clan in the estate with him.</p><br/><p>All of the devas lived in such a way.</p><br/><p>In the very middle of the sprawling estate was a lake of crystal-clear water, within which lazed a whole school of goldfish. The lake was actually part of the rainbow itself, which was a marvelous thing in and of itself.</p><br/><p>Next to the lake was an ordinary-looking log cabin, which was actually a holy place to the Chen Clan. And as the patriarch of the clan, and a deva, it was only natural that Chen Hetian lived there.</p><br/><p>As Bai Xiaochun whistled through the air, rumbling booms echoed out, and the clouds churned up above. Rippling distortions spread out in all directions from him.</p><br/><p>It immediately attracted a lot of attention from the other disciples. Furthermore, because of the close proximity to where the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars trials were held, many people from there looked over as well.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that sound?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 Patriarch Bai?\u201d</p><br/><p>Within the Chen Clan estate were numerous clan members who noticed the thunderous roar, much to their shock. When they looked over, they saw something like a shooting star rocketing toward them with incredible speed. A moment later, it was right there in the air above them.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the pressure of a deva weighed down in all directions like the will of the heavens, casting the cultivation bases of everyone down below into full chaos.</p><br/><p>The person up above was pure and fair, with a proud expression on his face, and his hands clasped behind his back. His chin was stuck up as though he were the most powerful expert in the world. He was none other than\u2026 Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>The fact that so many people were paying attention to him caused Bai Xiaochun to feel very pleased. Raising his voice, he said, \u201cChen Hetian, get the hell out here and greet Lord Bai!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had intentionally fused with heaven and earth and surpassed heavenly will, which made his voice boom especially loud. It was almost like an attack, a shockwave that caused many Chen Clan cultivators\u2019 faces to fall as they staggered backward.</p><br/><p>Even the disciples by the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars trials could hear his words, and it caused quite a commotion.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Bai\u2026 went to cause problems for Elder Chen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom the tone of Elder Bai\u2019s voice, it sounds like he wants to fight!!\u201d The cultivators in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect almost couldn\u2019t believe what they were seeing, and many of them flew up into the air in the hopes of getting a closer look. After all, conflicts between devas, although not completely unheard of, rarely progressed past simple friction.</p><br/><p>As Bai Xiaochun\u2019s voice echoed out, Chen Hetian was seated cross-legged in the log cabin, meditating. Suddenly, his eyes snapped open, and an expression of wrath appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>Before the events at the River-Defying Sect, if anyone had done something like this, he would have snorted coldly, rushed out, and killed the offender immediately. But now, he simply gritted his teeth; after all, he knew that because of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s shocking battle prowess, the two of them weren\u2019t on the same level.</p><br/><p>However, the fact that Chen Hetian was biting his tongue actually made Bai Xiaochun more irritated. Once again, he raised his voice and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, Chen Hetian? You're a deva, I'm a deva. Here I am at your front door. Don\u2019t tell me you aren\u2019t going to come out and say hi? How insolent!\u201d With that, Bai Xiaochun took an angry step forward, heading into the Chen Clan and toward the log cabin.</p><br/><p>The other Chen Clan cultivators were trembling in their boots, and didn\u2019t dare to interfere.</p><br/><p>Within moments, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s incredible speed had him closing in on the log cabin. In fact, ripples spread out across the surface of the lake, and even the goldfish began to tremble in fear.</p><br/><p>At this point, Chen Hetian couldn't hold back his anger any longer. He blurred into motion, flying up into the air and waving his hand to send a blast of wind at Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing, Bai Xiaochun?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, Bai Xiaochun unleashed a fist strike, striking the wind blast and sending a terrifyingly loud boom out in all directions.</p><br/><p>Chen Hetian grunted and fell back a few paces. However, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression remained exactly the same as ever. His fleshly body was so powerful it didn\u2019t seem necessary for him to defend himself. In fact, he continued forward and prepared to unleash another attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I doing? You brought this upon yourself, Chen Hetian! You know exactly what you did!\u201d In the blink of an eye, he was right in front of him.</p><br/><p>Chen Hetian\u2019s face was a mask of grimness as he performed a double-handed incantation gesture to send another attack at Bai Xiaochun. A boom rang out, and Chen Hetian fell back further. However, Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t slow down at all.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s performance so far had Chen Hetian grumbling bitterly in his heart. His anger continued to burn, and yet, he still held back. As he retreated, he said, \u201cThe demigod patriarch already issued his orders about the River-Defying Sect, Bai Xiaochun. You\u2019ve already killed Patriarch Starry River and Patriarch Dao River. What are you acting like this for!?!? What happened back at the Great Wall was a misunderstanding!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis has nothing to do with the River-Defying Sect or the Great Wall, Chen Hetian. Don\u2019t play dumb!\u201d Bristling with anger, Bai Xiaochun utilized his Undying Hex, blasting toward Chen Hetian. Performing an incantation gesture with his right hand, he waved, sending frigid qi blasting out, and summoning nine frigid projections. The projections immediately surrounded Chen Hetian on all sides.</p><br/><p>Chen Hetian\u2019s face fell. He quickly waved his hands out in front of him, causing a black shield of light to spring up and block the nine frigid projections. Falling back again, he angrily yelled, \u201cWhat exactly are you doing, Bai Xiaochun?!?! I'm not playing dumb! Explain yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun realized that Chen Hetian\u2019s voice was louder than his own, he felt very displeased. With even greater volume than before, he shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re the culprit here, and you want <em>me</em> to explain?! I'm not leaving until things are settled, Chen Hetian!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cY-you\u2026 YOU!!\u201d Chen Hetian was absolutely enraged by this point. He could tell that Bai Xiaochun hadn\u2019t come about the River-Defying Sect, and yet, couldn\u2019t think of what it might be about. After returning to the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, Chen Hetian had gone directly into secluded meditation, and had done nothing to provoke Bai Xiaochun since. Therefore, when Bai Xiaochun called him a \u2018culprit\u2019, it caused his anger to burn even hotter.</p><br/><p>It was a strange feeling. Chen Hetian was used to bullying other people, but now\u2026 he was the one being bullied\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun!\u201d he raged. \u201cThis is complete and utter bullying!!\u201d Even still, he had no idea what he had done to provoke Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had already dealt with people who wanted to kill him back when he was being chased by the Luochen Clan. That was when he came to realize that the only option in such a situation was to be more vicious than his opponents. Furthermore, he had to kill them before they killed him!</p><br/><p>That was the only way to stay alive!</p><br/><p>He transformed into a beam of light, causing heaven-shaking, earth-shattering rumbling to fill the area as he appeared next to another of the Foundation Establishment Dharma protectors who had attacked him moments ago, and directly bashed into him.</p><br/><p>A boom echoed out, and the Dharma protector screamed miserably as his body shattered into pieces. Bai Xiaochun shot through the blood and gore, then suddenly sped backward and grabbed ahold of the neck off another cultivator who had been preparing to launch a sneak attack. The man screamed as he was subsequently ripped to shreds.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was already soaked in blood, his breath coming in ragged pants, and his eyes bright red.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cWhat are you running for? Didn\u2019t you want to kill me?! Bring it on!\u201d</p><br/><p>He blurred into motion, appearing behind a terrified, fleeing Foundation Establishment cultivator. In the blink of an eye, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand clasped onto the man\u2019s shoulder. Howling, the man tried to perform an incantation gesture, but before he could, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s other hand grabbed his neck and squeezed down hard!</p><br/><p>A cracking sound echoed out, and the man was dead.</p><br/><p>As Bai Xiaochun turned back around, the other Foundation Establishment cultivators fled like mad, faces filled with terror. Some dove into their immortal's caves and activated the defensive spell formations, others simply tried to get as far away as possible.</p><br/><p>Some of them had banded together and were erecting a giant defensive spell formation to prevent Bai Xiaochun from getting to them. Song Que and Master God-Diviner were in that group.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not even human!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI've never seen a fiendish devil like this before!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! Nightcrypt is terrifying!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s explosive burst of violence left them completely shaken. To them, he seemed like a fiend, a monster, his clothes soaked in blood, his expression vicious and filled with murder.</p><br/><p>Such brutality, such madness, left the minds of all cultivators present completely reeling. Even Song Que was gasping, and as for Master God-Diviner, he was completely scared out of his mind.</p><br/><p>These were all Blood Stream Sect disciples, people who disciples from the other sects viewed as wildly brutal. However, as of this moment, those very disciples were looking at Bai Xiaochun and thinking that his brutality was beyond description.</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, whoever had just spoken out to stop Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t say anything further.</p><br/><p>Even the prime elders and the others were simply watching, clearly moved, and yet doing nothing to intervene. In fact, some of them even approached in person to watch the slaughter unfold.</p><br/><p>Breathing heavily, Bai Xiaochun looked over at the group in the spell formation, then grinned coldly as he shot toward a nearby immortal's cave. In the time it takes an incense stick to burn, he used his fleshly body power alone to batter to cave open. Moments later, he emerged from the cave dragging the corpse of the Foundation Establishment cultivator who had been hiding within. He tossed the corpse out in front of the spell formation, then sat down off to the side, exhausted. Wiping the blood off of his face, he looked up at the onlookers hovering in midair.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he blinked. Waves of exhaustion spread out through him, wrapping around his muscles and causing them to go slack. At the same time, he felt fear and regret. Although his outburst had allowed him to give vent to his anger, he was now getting nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn't use any Spirit Stream Sect techniques,\u201d he thought, trembling inwardly, \u201conly stuff from the Blood Stream Sect. Technically speaking, my body refinement magic is connected to the Blood Stream Sect. Maybe they\u2019ll punish me, but they won\u2019t kill me. Will they?\u201d Although he thought calling out to the giant hand to try to destroy the Blood Stream Sect, he wasn\u2019t confident at all in being able to succeed.</p><br/><p>Middle Peak was completely silent....</p><br/><p>Even in the Blood Stream Sect, slaughter like this was a rarity. To see such a fight left everyone completely shocked, and at the same time, changed their understanding of Nightcrypt.</p><br/><p>The silence was broken by the ancient voice. \u201cFinished killing people?!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, a blurry figure slowly materialized in front of Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>It was a middle-aged man wearing a long, blood-colored robe. He had his hands clasped behind his back as he hovered there, looking coldly at Bai Xiaochun. He radiated a sensation of terrifying blood qi, something that seemed to resonate with heaven and earth, to connect with Middle Peak itself!</p><br/><p>That blood qi became a mighty pressure that caused even Bai Xiaochun\u2019s spiritual seas to vibrate.</p><br/><p>When the man looked at Bai Xiaochun, it felt like he could see right through him, peer into his very depths, see past all illusions. Bai Xiaochun shivered.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, the mask he was wearing was a precious treasure from the mysterious sect, and still managed to conceal him. After a moment, the man muttered to himself and retracted his vision. With that, he waved his right hand, sending a small bottle flying toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cExceptional innate talent. Inverse Blood Ancestral Awakening. Even better than that, a devilish personality. Sadly, you\u2019re only at Mortal-Dao Foundation Establishment....</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are three Spirit Blood Pills in that bottle. They should heal your injuries and also make you more sensitive toward blood qi.\u201d With that, the man sighed, turned, and took a step forward. A wind blew past, and he was gone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Bai Xiaochun looked around in shock. He had been fully prepared to be punished, but instead, the man had gifted him with a bottle of medicinal pills.</p><br/><p>Up in midair, the grand elders of the mountain peaks looked down with shining eyes. The reason none of them had spoken up earlier was because of the arrival of the patriarch. Nightcrypt's transformation had been so monumental that the patriarch had personally come to inspect the situation. Considering he had found no problems, the grand elders\u2019 passions now burned even hotter than before.</p><br/><p>Not only did Nightcrypt have incredible natural talent, he had killed several people in very rare fashion. Even the patriarch said he had a devilish personality. All of the grand elders were impressed by Nightcrypt\u2019s genius. Then they thought back to how domineering he had been in the fight over the Foundation Establishment Pills, and their admiration grew stronger.</p><br/><p>Although killing was against sect rules, they didn't really care. In the Blood Stream Sect, the law of the jungle prevailed. Not a single one of them could claim to have hands free of blood. When people didn\u2019t know what was best for them, and provoked powerful experts, then the fault for their deaths lay at their own hands. When it came to low-level cultivators, the sect rules were more strictly enforced, but that was for their own protection. Foundation Establishment cultivators and the powerful experts above them respected strength and strength alone!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s ability to piss people off was quite moving. There was a big difference between making everyone like you, and making everyone hate you, but in the end, the result was the same as far as the leaders of the sect were concerned.</p><br/><p>When it came to success in those matters, the former would be champions of justice, the latter, devils.</p><br/><p>Considering he had such a devilish personality, if Nightcrypt could stay alive, then once his cultivation base improved, he would be a champion of the ages. Either he would conquer everything under the heavens, or the heavens would conquer him.</p><br/><p>The grand elder from Lesser Marsh Peak, the tall, burly cultivator, flew out with a smile on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt, come with me to Lesser Marsh Peak! With that body refinement technique of yours, it would be a huge waste for you to not come to Lesser Marsh Peak! If you agree, I\u2019ll let you reside on the upper finger! Come! I guarantee you\u2019ll make incredible, unheard-of achievements in body refinement!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was a bit stunned by the sudden outpouring of words from the grand elder of Lesser Marsh Peak. Before he could even react, though, the grand elder from Corpse Peak stepped forward. \u201cIgnore him, Nightcrypt. Join us on Corpse Peak. Corpse Peak will be your home for all eternity! Come! You can have your pick of all the colorful corpses we have!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt, they\u2019re not being sincere,\u201d cried the dwarf from Nameless Peak, who was ready to go all out to win over Bai Xiaochun with his Inverse Blood Ancestral Awakening. \u201cCome to Nameless Peak. I\u2019ll let you join the Circle of Bloodstreak Elders. With the power of Nameless Peak behind you, no one will ever dare to provoke you again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was at a loss for words. He had caused a huge disaster, killed seven or eight Foundation Establishment cultivators in a row, caused chaos to Middle Peak\u2019s blood qi, and had completely ignored that middle-aged man. Although he didn\u2019t know who that man was, he assumed he was a prime elder, or maybe even a patriarch.</p><br/><p>If he had defied someone like that back in the Spirit Stream Sect, and also been responsible for such a disaster, according to the sect rules, he would have been sent to the Hall of Justice to be skinned alive, bereft of his cultivation base, and then destroyed in body and soul.</p><br/><p>However, in the Blood Stream Sect, everything was the opposite.</p><br/><p>As he stood there stupefied, a flirtatious laugh echoed out as the bewitchingly beautiful Song Junwan appeared. A fragrant breeze accompanied her arrival, and a gleam of deep praise could be seen in her eyes as she looked at Bai Xiaochun as though he were a priceless gem. She came to a stop right in front of him, then turned to face everyone else.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Middle Peak! Are you people here to openly undermine me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun blinked at the sight of Song Junwan standing in front of him. She was dressed as audaciously as usual; her skirt had a long slit up the side, revealing her milky white legs, a sight which caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes to go wide. Before he realized what was happening, he was staring.</p><br/><p>The other three grand elders could see exactly what Song Junwan was doing, and they also noticed how Bai Xiaochun was staring at her. They sighed at Song Junwan\u2019s trickery, but could do nothing about it. Sighing longingly at Bai Xiaochun, they turned and left.</p><br/><p>After they were gone, Song Junwan\u2019s smile vanished, and her face became very grim as she looked around at the Foundation Establishment cultivators of Middle Peak. As her gaze passed over them, they trembled and bowed their heads silently.</p><br/><p>Song Que seemed more scared than anyone, and didn\u2019t even dare to look up. From a young age, he had always feared his aunt....</p><br/><p>\u201cYou're all dismissed,\u201d Song Junwan said coolly. \u201cDon\u2019t forget to come back later and clean this place up.\u201d Everyone breathed sighs of relief, and then left respectfully. Soon, the area was silent once again.</p><br/><p>Song Junwan turned her attention back toward Bai Xiaochun, an enigmatic smile on her face as she leaned forward and lifted his chin with her fair, jade-like hand, forcing him to look her in the eye. \u201cSeen enough, Little Bro Nightcrypt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Blushing, Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat and stood up straight, then clasped hands and bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Big Sis Song.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou need to be a bit more careful in the future. The Blood Stream Sect is a chaotic place, and it always has been. Maybe if things were different, we would be stronger in some ways, but there is nothing that can be done about it. All you can do is continue to find powerful enemies to defeat to impress people. As long as the patriarchs are around, the sect will remain whole. They can suppress the chaos when necessary.</p><br/><p>\u201cFor now, stay on Middle Peak. You\u2019ll be safe here, and the stronger you get, the more respect you will be shown.\u201d She smiled, and it was a smile like a blooming rose, making her somehow more indescribably beautiful than ever.</p><br/><p>After a moment of hesitation, Bai Xiaochun asked, \u201cBig Sis Song, was that a patriarch just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat was Patriarch Limitless!\u201d she replied softly. Seeing Bai Xiaochun\u2019s shocked reaction, she covered her smile with her hand and then left in a gust of fragrant wind.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun stood there for a long moment before taking a deep breath.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, that was the consummate Chosen from 800 years ago, Master Limitless!\u201d Bai Xiaochun looked around again, shaken. The more time that passed, the more he marveled at how well the Blood Stream Sect treated him. Back in the Spirit Stream Sect, he was always punished for causing disasters. Here, they not only withheld punishment, they actually rewarded him.</p><br/><p>All of the mountain peaks were fighting over him, and to top it off, Grand Elder Song Junwan was a smoking hot babe.</p><br/><p>This place was the perfect location to cultivate the Undying Live Forever Technique. It was his own personal Holy Land, filled with blood qi.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a great sect!\u201d Shaking his head, he realized he had to adjust his way of thinking. He was from the Spirit Stream Sect, an enemy of the Blood Stream Sect!</p><br/><p>And yet, he couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that the Blood Stream Sect was really great.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

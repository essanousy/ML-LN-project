After hearing everything that Bai Xiaochun had said so far, his heart was already filled with profound gratitude.</p><br/><p>\u201cNext,\u201d Bai Xiaochun continued, \u201cis the moon character, which represents timing and environment. We\u2019re all on a ship right now, and the two of you are staying on the same deck. That means you have the advantage in terms of location. With me on your side, you\u2019ll definitely succeed!\u201d He emphasized his last words by clapping his hands together loudly, then raising his voice and continuing, \u201cNext is the shell-money character, which I don\u2019t think we even need to discuss. You surely have plenty of spirit stones. Last is the mortal character, which is very important, and is the antithesis of the death character. You see, despite embracing a sense of crisis within you, you must also have a calm heart. You must not let yourself get flustered; you have to keep control. And remember, as we proceed, I\u2019ll take care of everything!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice seemed to thrum with encouragement and power, causing Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s blood to pump harder, and his mood to soar.</p><br/><p>As for Master God-Diviner and the others present, when they heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s more detailed explanation, they started to get even more excited, and began to pay more close attention than ever. After all, they could tell that what Bai Xiaochun was saying could probably help them as well.</p><br/><p>Only Song Que still felt a bit of derision, although even he couldn\u2019t quite tear himself away from listening.</p><br/><p>Coughing dryly, Bai Xiaochun said, \u201cDon\u2019t get excited yet, I haven\u2019t finished speaking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao personally refilled Bai Xiaochun\u2019s drinking vessel, after which Bai Xiaochun took a sip of alcohol to wet his throat. Then he continued, \u201cMy explanation of the Win Charm was mostly so that you could understand why Love Saint Bai Xiaochun was able to dominate the field of love for decades. At this point, we need to start talking specifics.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou see, on the field of love, you have to know yourself, and know your enemy. Furthermore, you have to be willing to adapt. If you want to get her to fall in love with you, you first have to get on the good side of her friends and family. If they think you\u2019re a good person, then you'll be a good person to her, even if you really aren\u2019t!\u201d Bai Xiaochun spoke with complete and utter confidence, making his words utterly convincing.</p><br/><p>Master God-Diviner suddenly slapped his thigh, and his eyes sparkled with bright light. Sitting up straight and tall, he looked at Bai Xiaochun with an expression of reverence; clearly, he took Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words to be like gospel at this point.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun, however, seemed a bit annoyed at the interruption. Looking askance at Master God-Diviner for a moment, he continued, \u201cThere is a fact of which you might not be aware. When it comes to female cultivators, many of them lack a sense of security, something which is compounded by the brutal nature of the cultivation world. If you can give a girl a sense of security, then you will be like a beam of light on a dark night. She will naturally be drawn to you. Once you succeed in that, then you will have taken your first step toward success....\u201d In response to these words, Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s eyebrows shot up with excitement.</p><br/><p>Apparently, Master God-Diviner was worried he might forget what he was hearing, and had pulled out a jade slip to inscribe the information permanently. As for Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s two followers, they were staring at Bai Xiaochun with looks of awe and reverence.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere are two important techniques you must master. Put simply, they are both ways to get her attracted to you! After you acquire her attention, you need to do as the line from the ancient poem says: <em>hold a lute in your arms and use it to cover your face</em>. In other words, make yourself seem mysterious! When she approaches you, back off! When she backs away, get closer to her! After a number of such back-and-forth encounters, she will eventually be filled with unquenchable desire! And that, heh heh, is when you will finally have hooked her!\u201d Even Bai Xiaochun was getting excited by this point, and was waving his arms in dramatic gestures as he spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is how to conceal the fact that you are pursuing her, and actually make it seem like <em>she\u2019s</em> the one pursuing <em>you</em>!</p><br/><p>\u201cBack in the Blood Stream Sect, I used this exact method to win the heart of Que\u2019er\u2019s aunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Que\u2019s expression grew even darker, and all of a sudden, it made complete sense why his aunt, who had never been one to be attracted to the immature type, fell head over heels for Bai Xiaochun....</p><br/><p>Although Song Que felt like simply walking out of the room, he had to admit that much of what Bai Xiaochun was saying could be useful in the future. Therefore, he quickly came up with an excuse to stay behind. \u201cI'm definitely going to make sure my aunt knows the truth about this Bai Xiaochun!\u201d he thought.</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao was completely shaken. Given the expression on Song Que\u2019s face, it was obvious that Bai Xiaochun wasn't lying. Therefore, Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s confidence only continued to grow.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that point, though, you will not have secured your win on the field of love. Your position will still be very precarious, and you will have to work hard to consolidate your standing.\u201d Bai Xiaochun felt extremely proud of himself at how shaken everyone was by his words. The truth was that during the past three days, he had spent a lot of time discussing the matter with imposter Nightcrypt, and had himself been quite shaken by what he had heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand!\u201d Zhao Tianjiao said excitedly. \u201cI get what you mean by consolidating my standing. It\u2019s like cultivation. After you make a breakthrough, you have to stabilize your cultivation base. I get it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, you <em>don\u2019t</em> get it!\u201d Bai Xiaochun barked, glaring. \u201cWhat you get is how to build upon existing feelings. That\u2019s not what I'm talking about. The highest realm in this aspect of love is being able to keep your distance! You need to get her worked up emotionally, to give her the feeling that she could lose you at any moment. That\u2019s when you finally make your move!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou absolutely, positively must not spend too much time with her during this phase. If you do, she\u2019ll be too complacent regarding the growing feelings between the two of you. You must make her treasure such feelings! You must make her hell-bent on being with you. Remember, the easier something is to get, the less precious it will be in the end.\u201d Suddenly, Bai Xiaochun lapsed into silence, an expression of reminiscence and longing appeared on his face, as though he were lost in his memories of love, and the bittersweet recollections of an immature youth.</p><br/><p>The truth was that he was actually thinking back to what he and imposter Nightcrypt had discussed, reviewing what came next in the speech, and mentally rehearsing how to say it. After enough time passed for two incense sticks to burn, his thoughts were in order.</p><br/><p>Of course, during that time, Zhao Tianjiao was on the verge of prostrating himself in admiration, and was convinced that Bai Xiaochun must abound with countless stories regarding love and relationships.</p><br/><p>In any other circumstance, there was no way that Zhao Tianjiao, with his level of experience in life, would be so easily swayed. But the truth was that his heart was completely wrapped up with thoughts of Chen Yueshan. Therefore, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words left him totally shaken, and the way Bai Xiaochun was explaining things left him utterly bereft of any powers of judgment....</p><br/><p>Eyes still flickering with the gleam of reminiscence, Bai Xiaochun began to speak in a voice so soft it seemed that he had forgotten about Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s presence. \u201cYou have to take your time. Make it seem like you are slowly coming to accept her....</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, when the moment is right, you give her the surprise of her life. Make her feel that the only reasonable decision is to become your Daoist partner. Up to that point, she will have been stewing in nervousness over the prospect of losing you, only to be suddenly overwhelmed with joy. When that happens for you, Elder Brother Zhao, I will finally be able to offer my congratulations to you for succeeding!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, he seemed to have fully emerged from his memories of the past, and looked over at Zhao Tianjiao. Raising his voice, he said, \u201cHowever, I have to warn you, Elder Brother Zhao, relationships are not easy, and since you are going at it with a long and complicated plan, you must promise to never cast your loved one away. If you do, you will surely be punished by the heavens!\u201d By this point, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words were spoken so loudly that they were almost deafening. Zhao Tianjiao was completely shaken, and immediately jumped to clasp hands and bow deeply.</p><br/><p>Expression serious, and eyes shining with determination, he spoke in the most decisive of decisive voices, \u201cI, Zhao Tianjiao, hereby solemnly swear that if I can tie the knot with Junior Sister Yueshan, then she will be my only Daoist partner for my entire life! If I break my oath, may the heavens destroy me and the earth bury me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, nodding approvingly like a member of the Senior generation. \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, then it's not in vain that I, Love Saint Bai Xiaochun, have explained my secrets to you!\u201d Then he looked over at Master God-Diviner, Song Que, and Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s two followers. \u201cThe same goes for the rest of you too!\u201d</p><br/><p>Master God-Diviner didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment to swear a similar oath. As for Song Que, when Bai Xiaochun looked directly at him, he felt a bit guilty, and almost swore an oath, but finally just snorted and refused to speak.</p><br/><p>As for Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s two followers, they were completely shaken, and didn\u2019t even think twice about swearing oaths.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun nodded in satisfaction. After taking another sip of alcohol, he looked at the fervent Zhao Tianjiao, then smiled and stuck his chin up.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, the formalities having been dispensed with, the time has come for you to go ingratiate yourself with Elder Sister Yueshan\u2019s close friends and family.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait,\u201d Zhao Tianjiao said miserably, \u201cI can\u2019t do that! Junior Sister Yueshan only has two good friends, and both of them left for the Wildlands years ago. Furthermore, in terms of her family, her father is my Master, and he's very strict. How can I ingratiate myself with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour master is old three-eyes?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, his jaw dropping.</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao cleared his throat, and was thinking of correcting the way Bai Xiaochun referred to his Master, but considering that he was here asking for help, he pretended that he hadn\u2019t noticed.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart suddenly surged as he realized that if he could get Zhao Tianjiao and Chen Yueshan together, then it would essentially mean that he would have a deva on his side. He immediately began to consider more ways to handle Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s situation.</p><br/><p>After a moment, his eyes began to sparkle.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, let\u2019s shift tactics. You need to get Elder Sister Yueshan\u2019s attention. Therefore, we need to know what type of man she likes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm not sure!\u201d Zhao Tianjiao said, looking even more miserable than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take care of everything. The easiest way to get an idea about someone\u2019s personality is to look at the clothing they wear. How about this: you leave it to me to pick what clothes to wear over the next few days. It shouldn\u2019t take long to figure out what she likes.\u201d As Bai Xiaochun imagined all the different clothing he would have Zhao Tianjiao wear, he couldn\u2019t help but muse that this was the perfect plan. With that, he pulled Zhao Tianjiao closer and began to whisper into his ear the details of which outfits he should get ready.</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s expression flickered. His eyes went wide, he hissed, he gasped, and soon, a bitter expression appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo we really have to do it that way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, absolutely! Pay attention to her reaction. If she frowns, or simply looks away, it means she doesn\u2019t like that outfit. If she looks more closely, it means she\u2019s interested. Either way, you need to keep me informed immediately of all developments.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao seemed to be vacillating, leading Master God-Diviner and the others to wonder exactly what outfits Bai Xiaochun wanted Zhao Tianjiao to wear.</p><br/><p>But finally, Zhao Tianjiao decided to throw caution to the wind. Gritting his teeth, he nodded and said, \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever you say!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

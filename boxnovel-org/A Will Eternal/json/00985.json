Lord Bai is really coming for you this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside, the ghost face\u2019s expression turned dark with rage. However, since he was made from black smoke, it was difficult to see how dark it actually was\u2026.</p><br/><p>By now, Bai Xiaochun could tell that he could reach the eighth of the Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformations.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy eighth transformation is actually equivalent to the eleventh!\u201d Although he couldn\u2019t say that he was invincible in all creation, he was definitely close.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd my Undying Blood\u2026.\u201d Licking his lips, he studied his Undying Blood, and confirmed that he had broken through in that regard as well. As of this moment, sixty percent of the blood in his body was Undying Blood!</p><br/><p>That made his powers of regeneration even more shocking than before. In terms of his own life force, he was now fairly certain that, even if heaven and earth were destroyed around him, he would not be destroyed.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is unheard-of strength!\u201d he thought, feeling more confident in himself than ever. \u201cNobody under the level of a demigod could beat me!\u201d</p><br/><p>In his pride, he couldn\u2019t help but raise his voice again\u2026. \u201cAlright, old ghost, this time, I really am coming over there!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that point, his eyes suddenly flickered.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the old ghost responding to me? It seems his cultivation base really must be dropping\u2026.\u201d During the time he had been working on reaching the late Deva Realm, he hadn\u2019t stopped paying any attention to things outside of the wind valleys.</p><br/><p>Because of that, he could sense that, thanks to the pressure of the magical item, the ghost face\u2019s cultivation base had dropped. That, coupled with his taunts from earlier, confirmed everything.</p><br/><p>Eyes shining with determination, he shot into motion, leaving the wind valleys and appearing in the world beyond them.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun seemed like the wind itself, a hurricane that blasted across the lands with explosive power.</p><br/><p>Although he looked quite impressive, he was actually being very cautious, and was ready to fall back at a moment\u2019s notice. But after emerging into the open and blinking a few times, he realized that the ghost face was nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>Eyes lighting up, he sent some divine sense out, causing heaven and earth to distort from the sheer force. Within moments, the entire world of the magical item was visible via his late Deva Realm divine sense.</p><br/><p>It only took a moment before he found the ghost face, fleeing in the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>The instant Bai Xiaochun\u2019s divine sense locked onto him, he confirmed that he had dropped into the late Deva Realm.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun immediately roared with laughter, causing all of the anxiety that had built up since he had arrived in the magical item to drain away. He suddenly felt carefree and excited as he began to give chase.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to race with Lord Bai, eh, you old ghost?\u201d With that, he drew upon the full power of his cultivation base, using the Undying Hex and the Mountain Shaking Bash together to rocket through the air and appear right behind the ghost face.</p><br/><p>The ghost face\u2019s expression was unsightly to the extreme, and fury burned in his heart. Even as he fled in absolute disgrace, he opened his mouth and shouted, causing countless smoke mouths to suddenly shoot toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Shocked, Bai Xiaochun backed up and performed a double-handed incantation gesture, sending frigid qi out to meet the gaping mouths.</p><br/><p>As soon as the two met, the seemingly shocking mouths collapsed into bits of black smoke. Meanwhile, the blast of frigid qi proceeded directly toward the ghost face.</p><br/><p>Cursing bitterly, the ghost face continued to flee. In contrast, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were shining brightly. Laughing heartily, he clenched his right hand into a fist and punched out.</p><br/><p>Rumbling booms filled the area as the blow hit the ghost face, causing the smoke he was composed of to roil unstably.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t push things too far, Bai Xiaochun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you dare to fight with Lord Bai, you old ghost?!?!\u201d With that, he used the eighth Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformation, growing to a height of 240 meters and bursting with energy.</p><br/><p>The moon sigil in his left eye shone radiantly, pushing his battle prowess to even higher heights. Although he wasn\u2019t quite at the demigod level, he was certainly very close.</p><br/><p>Waving his hand, he attacked again, and the ghost face was powerless to fight back. The situation between the two of them had been completely reversed, and despite the fact that the ghost face had known this would happen, it was still difficult to accept it. A boom rang out, and the ghost face was shattered by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fist strike.</p><br/><p>The innumerable strands of black smoke quickly formed back into the image of the ghost face, who was experiencing something he had never before experienced. Long ago, Ghostmother had relied on the backing of an archaean to capture him, and had also treated him very politely. Here\u2026 Bai Xiaochun, a person the ghost face could crush easily were his cultivation base not suppressed, was smacking him around with deadly force.</p><br/><p>The ghost face was so angry that his voice quavered as he shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t force my hand, Bai Xiaochun!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFudge, I'm not forcing you to do anything. I'm just beating you!\u201d Bai Xiaochun felt wonderful at having all the stress from before melt away, to be replaced by remarkable joy. Shouting at the top of his lungs, he strode forward and unleashed another fist strike.</p><br/><p>More booms rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho forced you to try to kill me before?!?!\u201d Another fist strike!</p><br/><p>The ghost face couldn't dodge out of the way in time. No amount of shrieking or divine abilities or magical techniques did any good. Yet again, his body collapsed, to be reformed a moment later.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho forced you to chase me into this place?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun struck out with his fist again!</p><br/><p>\u201cWho forced you to keep chasing me once we got stuck inside?!?!</p><br/><p>\u201cI ran into that thundercloud region, and you still wouldn\u2019t let me go!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe lightning dispersed, and you started chasing me again!\u201d He emphasized everything he said with a fist strike, each of which caused the ghost face to shatter and reform.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm gonna kill you, Bai Xiaochun!\u201d the ghost face howled madly. Finally, he couldn't take it anymore, and lunged at Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>However, before he could get close, Bai Xiaochun leaned back and kicked out, planting his foot directly onto the ghost face.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuite the bragger, aren\u2019t we? Still think you can kill me?!\u201d The ghost face broke apart and then formed back together, whereupon Bai Xiaochun shattered him again.</p><br/><p>Finally, he reached out, grabbed the ghost face by his smoke hair, and smashed him down onto the ground. He wasn\u2019t even using divine abilities, only his fleshly body power, and the force of the Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformation.</p><br/><p>Screams rang out as Bai Xiaochun trampled on the ghost face, which shattered and reformed the entire time. Eventually, it burned some life force to try to flee.</p><br/><p>Flicking his sleeve, Bai Xiaochun stuck his chin up and proudly said, \u201cThink you can just run? If I don\u2019t beat the crap out of you until you cry uncle, then my name isn\u2019t Bai Xiaochun!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he continued to give chase.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

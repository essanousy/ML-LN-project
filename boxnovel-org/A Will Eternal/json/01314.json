After a moment, he looked away from the Eternal Flower on the right.</p><br/><p>The old boatman took out another jug of alcohol, took a sip, and then looked at Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat flower really suits you. It\u2019s not going back to the beginning, but neither is it the true ending.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t say anything, and it was impossible to tell what he was thinking. He looked at the flower on the left, and then the flower on the right, and finally, closed his eyes again.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take that flower on the right? It seems wonderful to me. Although, both of them are actually acceptable\u2026. Trying to pick between the two seems like a very difficult choice.\u201d The old man sighed. Truthfully, not even he would have an easy time making this choice.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne of them features a set conclusion. Although it would conform to your desires, everything is already set.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other features endless possibilities, and a future brimming with options. Maybe you could make things more perfect. Maybe you could get rid of all your doubts, and make your future exactly the way you want it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old man shook his head. \u201cHow will you pick\u2026? Would you like to have a drink while you consider?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>With that, he held out his jug of alcohol.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Bai Xiaochun said. Opening his eyes, he looked out at the two flowers. Smiling, he reached out\u2026.</p><br/><p>The End.</p><br/><p>1314. One Life, One Lifetime. A Will Eternal!</p><br/><p>(In Chinese, the number 1314 rhymes with the characters that mean \u201cone life, one lifetime\u201d or essentially \u201cone\u2019s whole life.\u201d It's a very sentimental and somewhat romantic number)</p><br/>\n</div>"}

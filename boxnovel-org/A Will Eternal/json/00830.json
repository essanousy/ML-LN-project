Apparently, if he didn\u2019t wipe out this bizarre opponent, the consequences would be too severe, even more so than the possibility of his trump card destroying the world!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was so shocked that his tongue stuck to the top of his mouth. The spectacular nature of the Giant Ghost King\u2019s divine ability defied description, and Bai Xiaochun could actually sense the rage in the aura that emanated off of him. And there was little need to even mention that black sun!</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun looked at the sun, he could visualize endless charred lands filled with agony and death!!</p><br/><p>If that sun landed onto the surface of the ground, he couldn't be exactly sure of what would happen, but he was fairly certain that a large portion of the Wildlands would end up in complete ruins!!</p><br/><p>\u201cHow\u2026 how could this be happening!?!?\u201d he thought, his face draining of blood. Stunned by the Giant Ghost King\u2019s dramatic choice, his heart began to pound, and then he quickly transmitted a message. \u201cYour Highness, be careful if she explodes! She\u2019ll turn into a blood shadow that absorbs life force!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although the Giant Ghost King didn\u2019t show any sign of having heard, his eyes flickered slightly.</p><br/><p>Even Gongsun Wan\u2019er gasped, and a very serious expression appeared on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, this is what I would expect of a demigod\u2026. It hardly took you any time at all to find\u2026 my one weakness\u2026.\u201d Although her pupils constricted with shock, it was still possible to see the same glimmer of greed therein. Letting out a high-pitched shriek, she leapt up into the air, performing an incantation gesture that caused a spinning black vortex to appear in her palm!</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm an indestructible soul! Nobody can kill me! All divine abilities and all living things are nothing more than food for me\u2026. I get stronger with each fight, and the only way to kill me is to make me absorb so much energy that I explode\u2026. Alright, let\u2019s see what happens. Will you exploit my weakness to kill me, or\u2026 will you help me get rid of that weakness!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>A crafty smile could be seen on her face as she flew forth and then slammed directly into the black sun.</p><br/><p>As they connected, the terrifyingly destructive power released by the black sun was actually absorbed into the black vortex in Gongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s palm!</p><br/><p>As it happened, Gongsun Wan\u2019er trembled, and was pushed backward relentlessly. And yet, she continuously absorbed the destructive power, her eyes flickering with bizarre light as she did.</p><br/><p>When the Giant Ghost King saw what was happening, his expression flickered. And yet, a cold smile touched his eyes, and he waved both hands out in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you like it, I\u2019ll help you absorb your fill!!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he shoved the black sun toward her. At the same time, black smoke roiled off of him, merging into the sun and lending it more power.</p><br/><p>The process caused the Giant Ghost King to shrink. And yet, his goal of making the sun more powerful was met. Intense rumbling sounds spread out, causing heaven and earth to grow dark, and a massive wind to kick up. All spectators in the area began to fall back, their faces pale with fear.</p><br/><p>From a distance, it was possible to see the Giant Ghost King shrinking down and down while the black sun grew larger and larger. In the blink of an eye, it was thousands of meters across, and the Giant Ghost King was the size of a normal person, pushing the sun toward Gongsun Wan\u2019er.</p><br/><p>A scream escaped Gongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s lips. Her body seemed to be swelling from the influx of destructive power, and as she struggled to maintain control, she lost her ability to maintain the appearance of Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Cracks spread out across her face, and then the rest of her body. In the blink of an eye, the surface of her body\u2026 shattered like a mirror!</p><br/><p>As the pieces fell, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face disappeared, revealing that she was not a man, but rather, a beautiful young woman!</p><br/><p>She had smooth, fair skin, and a sinister gleam in her eyes. Furthermore, anyone who could look closely enough would see that she had a second pair of smaller pupils within her pupils!!</p><br/><p>All onlookers gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not Bai Xiaochun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is that?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>By this point, Mistress Red-Dust had regained consciousness, and her face was a mask of shock at the bizarre nature of Gongsun Wan\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked up at her nervously, aware\u2026 that now everyone knew she wasn\u2019t him!</p><br/><p>More intense rumbling sounds echoed out as the black sun began to shrink down rapidly. The Giant Ghost King was focusing all of its destructive power onto Gongsun Wan\u2019er, forcing her to absorb it whether she wanted to or not!</p><br/><p>Soon, the black sun was only 3,900 meters across, and Gongsun Wan\u2019er, who was inflated almost like a balloon, trembled violently. Cracks appeared on her face, neck, and body, as she began to yet again crumble like a shattering mirror. It only took a moment before she let out a shrill shriek\u2026 and collapsed into pieces!!</p><br/><p>This time, as the pieces fell away, something else appeared\u2026 a young girl wearing a red robe, with a face so pale it seemed to be completely devoid of blood!!</p><br/><p>As soon as that girl appeared, the entire world seemed to grow colder. Furthermore, ice appeared everywhere, causing everyone in the audience to shiver from the nearly unbearable cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe has another body!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is she!?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s scalp felt like it was being stabbed with pins and needles, and he gasped. He would never be able to forget this little girl, whom he had first seen in the depths of the Fallen Sword Abyss.</p><br/><p>At this point, the Giant Ghost King\u2019s eyes glittered, and he quickly performed an incantation gesture with both hands, causing the 3,600-meter black sun to enter the girl\u2019s body with explosive force!</p><br/><p>The girl panted, her eyes gleaming with bone-like sinisterness. Then she let out a scream that cause the souls of all present to tremble as, for the third time, cracks began to spread out over the surface of her body!!</p><br/><p>At the same time, the black sun continued to shrink. Soon it was only 1,500 meters. 1,200 meters. 900 meters\u2026 300 meters. 150 meters. When it was only 30 meters across, the Giant Ghost King roared and shoved it forward with even more force!</p><br/><p>The little girl trembled violently as cracks filled the surface of her body, and then, she finally collapsed!!</p><br/><p>Revealed beneath the crumbling pieces was a shadowy form that looked like a conglomeration of fresh blood. Almost immediately, that blood exploded into something like a sea, that emanated a vile aura as it swept out rapidly in all directions.</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghost King bore the brunt of the attack. Even with his demigod cultivation base, he still coughed up a mouthful of blood, and flew back at top speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out of here!!\u201d And yet, the crimson sea of blood spread out faster than even the Giant Ghost King\u2019s voice. It didn\u2019t matter how quickly everyone fell back, it only took the blink of an eye for the sea to overwhelm them. As it did, any soul cultivators who it touched, regardless of the level of their cultivation base, were instantly transformed into desiccated corpses!</p><br/><p>Their life force, cultivation base, soul, and everything else about them were absorbed by the sea of blood. As for Bai Xiaochun, he had been relatively far away to begin with, and had been on guard, so as soon as the sea of blood appeared, he fled at top speed.</p><br/><p>However, his heart was pounding with even more shock and fear than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot even a demigod can kill her!!\u201d he thought, terrified. He knew that this ghostly girl had taken an interest in him on more than one occasion. It was all very mysterious, and in fact, upon analysis, it really seemed as if the girl should be thankful.</p><br/><p>\u201cBiting the hand that feeds you!!\u201d Looking back at the corpses in the sea of blood, he saw the deva patriarch of the Bai Clan, which caused him to tremble and accelerate. Others were near him in the same area, and were also fleeing in terror.</p><br/><p>Even as everyone fled, an enormous face appeared within the seething sea of blood. It was the face of the young girl, and she had a crooked smile on her face as she looked up at the grim Giant Ghost King.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 lose!!\u201d she said in a bizarre voice that sounded like a combination of men, women, old ones, and young children!</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghost King suddenly smiled. \u201cOh really?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

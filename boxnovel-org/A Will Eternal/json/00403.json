The other cultivators in the area were also looking on with disbelieving expressions.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way that was a minor teleportation!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCore Formation cultivators can\u2019t teleport!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe must have some sort of precious treasure! Either that, or he\u2019s mastered some special technique....\u201d</p><br/><p>The commotion was no surprise. Only Nascent Soul Daoist masters could perform minor teleportations, which were considered to be divine abilities that resulted when one\u2019s consciousness began to merge with heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>People under the Nascent Soul stage simply couldn\u2019t do that, not unless they possessed some unusual means of accomplishing it, but even that would indicate that such a person was not the type to be trifled with.</p><br/><p>A person who could teleport in such a way would be impossible to surround in battle, and would almost always have the initiative. A mere thought on their part could allow them to attack or retreat at will.</p><br/><p>The pupils of Li Yuansheng and his friends all constricted, and their hearts began to thump in their chests.</p><br/><p>After Bai Xiaochun evaded the combined attack of the dozen or so Core Formation cultivators, the layer of ice which had built up on the surface of the tavern faded away, revealing that it hadn\u2019t been damaged at all.</p><br/><p>To see Bai Xiaochun use a divine ability that could freeze a 3,000-meter area and then easily dispel the effect left the Azure Dragon Society cultivators very excited. As for the crowd that made up the audience, they couldn\u2019t help but gasp.</p><br/><p>Li Yuansheng and his friends were clearly shocked, but then their expressions turned serious; despite being silkpants, they were all disciples of the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, people who were experienced and knowledgeable. Before, they hadn\u2019t thought much of Bai Xiaochun at all, but now that they had actually tangled with him briefly, they viewed him in a completely different light.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, from the murderous aura which surrounded him, they could tell that he was not just some ordinary cultivator. He obviously had a lot of experience fighting, even more than the type of cultivators who went out on missions for the sect.</p><br/><p>Li Yuansheng\u2019s heart surged with anger, and he shot a glare at the boss of the Celestial Sky Society. As of this moment, he already regretted leaving the rainbow district, and he especially regretted bringing his friends with him. If he and his friends couldn\u2019t handle one opponent, then it wouldn\u2019t be long before they became the laughingstock of the sect.</p><br/><p>The boss of the Celestial Sky Society couldn\u2019t stop trembling. He had known that Boss Azure Dragon was a Core Formation cultivator, but never could he possibly have imagined that he would be so vastly superior to other ordinary cultivators. Not only could he hold his own against a group of a dozen or so people in the same cultivation level as him, he had actually gained the advantage. He was the type of incredible cultivator who had access to some sort of teleportation magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm....\u201d Even as the boss of the Celestial Sky Society began to pant in fear, Li Yuansheng\u2019s eyes turned icy cold, and he flickered into motion. In the blink of an eye, he became an enormous ball of flame that shot toward Bai Xiaochun. At the same time, his friends all unleashed various divine abilities, and the sky filled with multicolored light as a dozen Core Formation cultivators yet again joined forces to attack Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou people push things too far!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, his anger building. He took a step forward, causing frigid qi to explode out in all directions. He became the center of a whirling tempest that almost instantly slammed into his would-be attackers.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as Bai Xiaochun once again vanished, appearing a moment later behind one of his Core Formation opponents. Even as the man's face fell, Bai Xiaochun clenched his right hand and unleashed a vicious fist strike.</p><br/><p>More rumbling could be heard as the man\u2019s clothing suddenly swirled through the air to defend against the fist strike. Trembling, the man tumbled backward, blood spraying out of his mouth as frigid qi poured into him. Instantly, the blood coming out of his mouth began to freeze up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo,\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought with a frown, \u201chis clothes can defend against a significant blow....\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the injured Core Formation cultivator shouted frantically out in the hopes of warning his friends. \u201cHe has tremendous fleshly body pow--\u201d</p><br/><p>However, even as the words left his mouth, wings popped into being behind Bai Xiaochun, a flutter of which sent him rocketing forward at blinding speed to appear in front of the man yet again. This time, he reached out with lightning quickness and grabbed his opponent.</p><br/><p>A moment later, a boom rang out, as well as a scream, as the Core Formation cultivator was flung into the ground. Numerous bones in his body were now broken as he lay there in a crater, looking up at Bai Xiaochun with fear written across his face.</p><br/><p>Then, Bai Xiaochun used another teleportation to appear in front of a second opponent. This time, he didn\u2019t use a fist, but instead, his left foot, which he spun through the air rapidly in a vicious kick.</p><br/><p>A sonic boom echoed out, and the air distorted. At the same time, this second opponent\u2019s face fell as he drew upon all the strength he could to defend himself. However, the power and speed in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s left leg was backed by his Undying Tendons, and before his opponent could do anything, his foot landed on the man\u2019s lower back.</p><br/><p>A pop rang out that sounded almost like an inflated paper bag bursting. The second cultivator\u2019s eyes went wide, and before he could even open his mouth to speak, blood sprayed out of it, and he was sent flying hundreds of meters off to the side. Shockingly, some of the vertebrae from the man\u2019s lower back had been shoved out of his skin and were even sticking out through his clothing! His screams could not have been any more agonized.</p><br/><p>And yet, things weren\u2019t over yet. Golden strands exploded out around the cultivator, some sort of restrictive spell that sealed his cultivation base and made him seem like little more than a mortal.</p><br/><p>Everyone who could see what had just occurred was left gasping.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Boss Azure Dragon is totally vicious!! Plus, he actually has the power to seal people with his attacks!!\u201d The battle still wasn\u2019t over, though. Bai Xiaochun spun in place, unleashing all the power of his Undying Live Forever Technique to defend against the magical techniques that two Core Formation cultivators had just unleashed from behind him. Then, a vicious expression appeared on his face as he once again spun his left foot in a powerful kick. Instantly, the two cultivators who had just tried to attack him from behind were sent flying through the air, golden strands wrapping around them and sealing them. Both of them now had numerous broken bones to deal with, and one of them had been injured so badly in the leg that he was bleeding profusely.</p><br/><p>Next, several huge violet cauldrons materialized and began to smash down toward Bai Xiaochun\u2019s opponents. As they did, he performed another minor teleportation, appearing next to a fifth cultivator.</p><br/><p>However, by this time, the other cultivators were prepared, and instantly attacked with deadly force.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun snorted coldly and used the Mountain Shaking Bash to shoot forward like an explosive dragon to slam into a nearby cultivator. That cultivator instantly coughed up blood as he was sent tumbling backward, his chest caved in. Next, Bai Xiaochun turned in place and performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, waving at three incoming attackers.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrigid!\u201d he murmured inwardly. Instantly, frigid qi billowed out, and cracking sounds could be heard as the air in front of him froze up. At the same time, the three incoming cultivators suddenly stopped in place.</p><br/><p>Because of their faltering momentum, Bai Xiaochun sped forward and kicked out again with this left foot. Boom. Boom. Boom!</p><br/><p>All three were sent spinning away, blood spraying out of their mouths.</p><br/><p>All of this takes a bit of time to describe, but from the moment Bai Xiaochun first made a move until this moment, only a few breaths\u2019 worth of time had passed. The silkpants were routed one after another, until the only ones who remained standing were Li Yuansheng and three others.</p><br/><p>Those three were trembling in shock. After looking around at their defeated comrades, they quickly began to back up, having no desire to participate in any more of Li Yuansheng\u2019s affairs. The pitiable state of their friends was the most effective warning message that could possibly have been sent to them.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the gasps of the onlookers grew into a strange silence. Apparently, they were so flabbergasted by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s actions that they couldn\u2019t even utter a sound.</p><br/><p>Li Yuansheng was shaking visibly. For the space of a few breaths of time, all he could do was look around at his friends, who were either unconscious or running away. Within moments, he was the only person left hovering there in midair. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s teleportation ability, and his shocking battle prowess, made him like a monster to people in the same cultivation level as him, someone virtually impossible to fight against!</p><br/><p>Beads of sweat popped out on Li Yuansheng\u2019s forehead as he looked down at Bai Xiaochun with bloodshot eyes. Suddenly, a cold feeling rose up from the pit of Li Yuansheng\u2019s stomach, and he began to back up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t you come on down from up there too?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun, his eyes flickering with icy light.</p><br/><p>Because of the frigid shadows in the area, and his incredible speed, he appeared as if by teleportation right in front of Li Yuansheng, who had been just on the verge of trying to flee. Then, he reached out with his right hand, drawing on the power of his Heavenly King Body in his attempt to grab Li Yuansheng.</p><br/><p>A gravitational force appeared, and the frigid qi in the area transformed into countless needles of ice that instantly turned toward Li Yuansheng and began to speed in his direction. Li Yuansheng\u2019s face fell, and he shouted, \u201cHow dare you try to hurt me!! I'm Li Yuansheng, from a deva clan! I don't care who you have backing you, I\u2019ll see you expelled from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect within three days!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In less time than it takes half an incense stick to burn, two soulgrounds were wiped completely clean of all souls....</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was extremely pleased with the number of soul spheres he had ended up with, which was enough to keep him going, at least temporarily.</p><br/><p>However, in the moment in which he sucked up the last of the souls, he apparently triggered something in the spell formation, which sent a shining pillar of light up into the sky. Obviously, it was something that the Cai Clan would quickly notice!</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Does emptying the soulgrounds set off the spell formation?\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought, his face falling. The bright light of the spell formation was instantly noticed by people in the Cai Clan, who began to utter exclamations of shock as they flew up into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that... is that coming from the soulgrounds!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened? It looks like a soulground spell formation is flaring up. No wait, two soulgrounds!!\u201d Even the Cai Clan patriarch flew out and hurried in the direction of the soulgrounds.</p><br/><p>Jittery with fear, Bai Xiaochun prepared to leave, but then stopped in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoul Convergence Pills leave evidence behind. If people look into it too closely, they might guess who I really am.... I need to get rid of the evidence. Even if they see me, it won't matter as long as my true identity isn\u2019t revealed.\u201d He quickly pulled out a twelve-colored flame that he had conjured earlier in preparation for another attempt at thirteen-colored flame. Instantly, one of his clones stepped out, and furthered the conjuring process!</p><br/><p>Considering how well-practiced he was, and that his clone was helping, everything went very quickly.</p><br/><p>However, conjuring flame wasn\u2019t his true goal. Just when the thirteenth color was about to appear, the flame destabilized, thanks to his clone. Then, the fire exploded!</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds filled heaven and earth as bright red clouds appeared overhead. Then, numerous bolts of thirteen-colored flame appeared and began to fall from the sky....</p><br/><p>Incomparably intense heat filled heaven and earth, and the two soulgrounds were instantly incinerated.</p><br/><p>In fact, not only was the evidence of the Soul Convergence Pills removed, but the spell formations were also destabilized, and began to collapse. Of course, Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t the type to kill indiscriminately, so he made sure to throw the unconscious Cai Clan cultivators off to a safe location.</p><br/><p>Even as the flames spread, Bai Xiaochun transformed into a beam of light that shot away at high speed, filled with the thrill of having robbed the souls he needed and then destroyed the evidence.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho told you to go rob my souls? Hmmmphh!\u201d His heart was pounding with the realization that he had just done something big....</p><br/><p>However, now was not the time to ponder the situation. Even as he began to speed away, an enraged roar erupted out.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you meddle with our Cai Clan soulgrounds? Do you have a death wish?!?!\u201d Eight figures appeared out in the open, and began to move with lightning-like speed. One of them was a young man who appeared to be less than thirty years of age, but who had a full head of silver hair, and radiated the aura of the great circle of Core Formation.</p><br/><p>There was even a bit of a Nascent Soul feel to him, as though he were so close to the Nascent Soul stage that all he had to do was go into secluded meditation and spend a bit of time, and he would succeed!</p><br/><p>In terms of speed, he was already similar to a Nascent Soul cultivator, and as he bore down on Bai Xiaochun, a look of fury could be seen in his eyes. As for the seven cultivators behind him, they were all Core Formation experts, and their faces all shone with rage when they saw the burnt, scorched soulgrounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you looking to die?!?!\u201d When they saw Bai Xiaochun fleeing off into the distance, their killing intent erupted with full power.</p><br/><p>They were just the first wave to appear. Next were the Nascent Soul clan elders.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was startled at how quickly the Cai Clan reacted, and knew that if he got involved in a protracted fight, he would likely end up with serious injuries. Therefore, he fled at top speed.</p><br/><p>Considering the speed he was capable off, he was instantly able to put a huge distance between himself and his pursuers. Then, he simply vanished.</p><br/><p>When the silver-haired chosen saw that Bai Xiaochun was about to make his escape, his killing intent grew even stronger. Without the slightest hesitation, he slapped his bag of holding to produce a beast hide, which he threw out in front of him. The beast hide instantly ignited, and as it burned up, the air behind the young man rippled as a shadowy beast appeared.</p><br/><p>It was an enormous, two-headed vulture, with a wingspan of several hundred meters. As soon as it appeared, it threw its head back and let loose a piercing cry before flapping its wings and taking to flight. At the same time, the Cai Clan chosen leapt onto its back. Shockingly, the young man was using some unknown technique to follow the evidence of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s passage and track him down.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun staggered out into the open roughly five kilometers away. Not pausing for even a moment, he headed at top speed toward Giant Ghost City.</p><br/><p>\u201cGotta speed up. If anyone from the Cai Clan catches me, I\u2019ll be in great danger....\u201d By now, the high he had felt from snatching all the souls was gone, and he was now starting to feel anxiety and fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey forced me to do it....\u201d he thought, wiping the sweat from his brow. As he rocketed through the air in a beam of light, Giant Ghost City got closer and closer. Within a few breaths of time, he would be there! However, that was when an intense whistling sound filled the air, and a blast of wild wind rose up. It was the type of wind that was capable of exterminating the life of anything it touched, and it instantly pierced Bai Xiaochun to the core.</p><br/><p>Shivering, he looked over his shoulder, whereupon his eyes went wide at the sight of the enormous two-headed vulture shooting toward him.</p><br/><p>On the vulture's back was the young man, his face a mask of fury, and a long, black spear held in his right hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpertinent thief! How dare you meddle with our Cai Clan soulgrounds! I'm going to kill you in body and soul!!\u201d Then the vulture accelerated as the young man drew on the full power of his cultivation base to shoot toward Bai Xiaochun, spear outstretched.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun simply couldn\u2019t react to the incredible speed of the vulture. In the blink of an eye, it was right on top of him, and the black spear in the hand of the Cai Clan chosen was stabbing toward him!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face fell as he let out a shout and threw his hands out to defend himself.</p><br/><p>BAAAAAAAANG!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun flew backward by several hundred meters. When he came to a stop, he examined himself, and then murmured, \u201cI'm not hurt?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s attack moments ago had seemed incredible, and Bai Xiaochun had assumed that he would be badly hurt. However, to his surprise, he was completely unscathed.</p><br/><p>\u201cFudge!\u201d he exclaimed in delight. \u201cThat vulture is super powerful, but compared to me, it\u2019s totally weak.... I guess it was just its speed that caught me unprepared.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>The young man on the vulture gasped in shock as he looked at Bai Xiaochun. His vulture was capable of speed rivaling the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage. Plus, he had been powering his spear with his cultivation base, which meant that he should have been able to seriously injure even someone in the Nascent Soul stage. But this thief ended up unharmed.... Completely shaken, the young man looked more closely at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face, which caused his eyes to widen.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re... you\u2019re Bai Hao!!\"</p><br/><p>Because of how he had rebelled against the Bai Clan, Bai Hao\u2019s face was very well known in the area. Although not everyone would recognize him, not even many of the silkpants cultivators of the three great clans, the elite chosen had all seen his picture. Because of the urgency of the situation earlier, this young man hadn\u2019t paid any attention to the person he was dealing with, but now that he took a closer look, he recognized him easily.</p><br/><p>Instantly, nervousness gripped his heart; he knew that Bai Hao was a vicious fiend who had captured the chief of the Bai Clan, who was a mid Nascent Soul stage expert. He had even provoked the Bai Clan\u2019s deva patriarch into action. Obviously, he was not the type of person to go around offending.</p><br/><p>\u201cRecognize me?\u201d Bai Xiaochun shouted. \u201cWell recognizing me won\u2019t do you any good!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shoving his hand out, he sent a blast of wind toward the Cai Clan chosen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Without falling back on that strategy, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to prevail. </p><br/><p>Feeling more than a bit angry, he quickly went from one chosen to the next and stabbed the Eternal Parasol into them. He made sure to shove it especially deeply into Zhou Hong, and took plenty of life force.</p><br/><p>Most people screamed, but Zhou Hong simply gritted his teeth and glared at Bai Xiaochun wordlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said. \u201cStill think you were in the right? Fudge! You stirred up trouble with me back in the Necromancer Kettle, then you tried to get Sun Yifan and Sima Tao to do your dirty work for you, and now you pull this little stunt?\u201d Bai Xiaochun really did want to just wipe Zhou Hong out of existence right here, but reminded himself that he couldn't forget how powerful Zhou Hong\u2019s father was\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf your dad wasn\u2019t a demigod, Lord Bai would have already killed you!\u201d Bai Xiaochun snorted coldly, and sucked even more life force out of him until there was almost none left. At that point, he felt his Tempered Bones beginning to thrum.</p><br/><p>Extracting the Eternal Parasol, he cast his senses inward to observe something warm flowing through him, originating within his bones. A tremor ran through him, and then he felt both his defensive powers and his overall strength increase.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, he was breaking out from the Tempered Bones level into\u2026 the Powered Bones level!</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! You people have powerful backgrounds, but so do I!\u201d Normally, his breakthrough in the Undying Bones would have been a cause for joy. But right now, he didn\u2019t feel excited at all. Furthermore, despite the words he had just uttered, he was actually feeling very nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have to pull through for me this time, Giant Ghost King!\u201d he thought. \u201cI'm really in trouble! I might not be your son, but I\u2019m your son-in-law, right? That counts as being half a son, at least!\u201d Sighing, he pondered that he really had been maligned in this situation. He was innocent! He hadn\u2019t done a thing! He had been minding his own business conjuring some flame when these crazy people burst onto the scene and started a fight.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was I supposed to do? If I didn't fight back, I would have gotten killed! And I didn\u2019t want to kill anybody either. That was an accident!\u201d The more he thought about it, the worse he felt. He wanted to simply flee, and yet knew that there was really nowhere to flee to.</p><br/><p>If he was going to end up as a fugitive in the Wildlands, then he might as well just reveal his true identity as Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it really goes that far\u2026 then I\u2019ve been thoroughly defeated. The Wildlands beat me! I can\u2019t believe that both of my identities are going to be put on the wanted list.\u201d As Bai Xiaochun considered all these matters, he truly wished he could cry. Furthermore, he didn\u2019t dare to try to perform another spirit enhancement on his nascent soul right now, otherwise people would easily be able to figure out who he really was.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I do? Ai\u2026 what a headache!\u201d Sighing, he finally sent a message to the Giant Ghost King explaining that he had killed a few people. The Giant Ghost King didn\u2019t respond at first. Then he cursed Bai Xiaochun a bit, and then went to handle matters.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun actually felt a bit better after the Giant Ghost King cursed him, and mused that it was not in vain that he had been so loyal to the man\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then there\u2019s Xu Shan and Chen Manyao, they\u2019re the ones that caused this whole mess\u2026.\u201d Throughout the course of the fight, many of the people who had come to attack him had specifically mentioned those two young women, which was very telling. \u201cThose two caused the problems, then ran!\u201d </p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s thoughts were causing him to feel more and more depressed. It was at this point that his expression flickered, and he looked up into the sky. Intense rumbling sounds were echoing out, and incredible pressure began to weigh down everywhere.</p><br/><p>Two enormous faces appeared up above, one of them that of a middle-aged man, the other an older man. Deva auras also erupted out, sealing down the entire area and turning into something like a prison.</p><br/><p>\u201cDevas\u2026.\u201d he thought, his eyes widening. Obviously, these were people from the clans of some of the chosen who had attacked him, and were two of the ten heavenly dukes of Arch-Emperor City.</p><br/><p>In addition to them, there were also numerous auras belonging to half-devas. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered; it currently felt as if innumerable deadly weapons were all targeting him and him alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo devas,\u201d he thought, heart pounding loudly in his chest. \u201cNine half-devas, and countless other soul cultivators\u2026.\u201d Arch-Emperor City had the biggest collection of top experts in the entire Wildlands, and as such, devas weren\u2019t exactly a rare sight. However, when considering the Wildlands as a whole, they were definitely not common.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was feeling more nervous than ever. In contrast were Zhou Hong and the other chosen, all of whom sat there looking like nothing more than skin and bones. When they saw the two devas appear, the excitement in their eyes was immediately apparent.</p><br/><p>The two devas looked down at Bai Xiaochun and the people around them. They saw how the life force of the chosen had been damaged, including many of the heirs apparent. At that point, unsightly expressions could be seen on the faces of the devas.</p><br/><p>Soon, their gazes locked onto Bai Xiaochun, gazes that were filled with killing intent. Considering their status, they didn\u2019t actually need to do anything in this situation; their mere presence here made their attitude clear.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeize this Bai Hao!\u201d said the middle-aged deva, his voice booming with heavenly might.</p><br/><p>In response to his cold voice, the nine half-deva heavenly marquises all surged with killing intent. Those heavenly marquises were clearly incensed by the sight of their chosen heirs reduced to such pitiable states. There were even two marquises who had members of their clans among the dead.</p><br/><p>Within moments of the heavenly duke issuing the order, nine beams of light were shooting toward Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>There was no time for thought or planning; Bai Xiaochun immediately fled backward. As he did, the space he had just occupied collapsed into rubble in a crashing boom.</p><br/><p>If he had been even a moment slower in evading, he would have been caught in that destruction.</p><br/><p>His heart was racing, but at the moment, he couldn't think of what to do. He could only trust that the Giant Ghost King would be able to smooth things over. In the meantime, he had no choice but to flee in the face of the nine half-deva heavenly marquises.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had faced a half-deva in the form of the Junior Champion King, but these people were different. During that fight, the Junior Champion King had just broken through into that level, whereas these nine heavenly marquises had long since stabilized their cultivation bases. They were fully and truly half-devas, and had been for years. They were elites among half-devas!</p><br/><p>Each and every one of them would be a match for Bai Lin without question!</p><br/><p>If Bai Xiaochun fought them one at a time, he might be confident enough to win. But to face all nine at once left him with no choice other than to simply run.</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!</p><br/><p>The nine heavenly marquises didn\u2019t hold back at all. They directly used their trump cards, causing brilliant light to shine in the air as magical techniques and divine abilities shook heaven and earth. It was almost as if a bizarre, nine-fingered hand were reaching out to grab Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>The hand was so terrifying that Bai Xiaochun was shaking in fear. For some reason, he had the feeling that if that hand touched him, then not even his powerful fleshly body would be able to hold out. He would be killed in body and soul!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t hurry up and fix this, Giant Ghost King, then my poor little life is going to be over!\u201d He was shrieking inwardly, and sweat poured down his face. He couldn\u2019t have been more aware that if he was even the least bit slow, then that nine-fingered hand would close around him!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you people have what it takes, come at me one by one!\u201d he shouted angrily. Thankfully, he was capable of shocking speed which, when combined with his cultivation base, made him incredibly fast. Most importantly, he had broken through to the Powered Bones level, which gave him an added bit of speed.</p><br/><p>Numerous afterimages appeared as he sped away, making it impossible for the divine abilities of the heavenly marquises to even touch him. However, he couldn\u2019t fight back, only buy time.</p><br/><p>The nine heavenly marquises frowned. The fact that they had attacked together showed how seriously they took this opponent, and yet, his incredible speed was making it temporarily impossible to deal with him.</p><br/><p>It was at that point that the middle-aged heavenly duke up in midair snorted coldly. The face which represented him rippled inward on itself until it took the shape of the heavenly duke himself. Then, he waved his right index finger at the fleeing Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Even as he began to move his hand through the air, though, Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s enraged voice echoed out.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay your hand, Chen Haosong!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

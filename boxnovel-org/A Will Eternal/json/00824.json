Then, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face fell as the force of the blow sent him plummeting back down onto the deck of the heavenly airship, which shuddered violently.</p><br/><p>Aura flickering unstably, Bai Xiaochun looked up to find that he had only shoved Lei Shan back upward a few paces.</p><br/><p>Not pausing for a second, he shot back toward Lei Shan, whereupon the two began to fight back and forth fiercely. As they did, the heavenly airship continued to shoot along at top speed until it was a good distance away.</p><br/><p>At that point, Mistress Red-Dust struggled up to take the helm, whereupon she slowed the airship to a stop. The way she gasped from the effort made it obvious how weak she was. Turning, she looked back nervously at Bai Xiaochun and Lei Shan fighting in midair.</p><br/><p>Rumbling booms echoed out constantly through the sky as Lei Shan relied, not on magical techniques, but only on his fleshly body. However, that alone made him an opponent the likes of which Bai Xiaochun had never faced!</p><br/><p>\u201cDeva-level fleshly body, huh?!?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s murderous aura grew stronger as he was shoved backward by attack after attack. None of the blows he landed on Lei Shan seemed to have any effect, and yet every blow he sustained was shockingly damaging.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Lei Shan has some really uncanny power\u2026. I can\u2019t keep this up. I have to end things quickly! Even if I can\u2019t kill him, I at least need to slow him down!\u201d He was mostly worried that if things went on too long, Gongsun Wan\u2019er would break free, and that any advantage he had built up would disintegrate. At that point\u2026 he would almost surely die!</p><br/><p>His eyes were completely bloodshot as he contemplated whether or not to reveal who he was. After all, it wouldn\u2019t make any sense to lose his poor little life just to keep his identity secret!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Gongsun Wan\u2019er still looked like him. Therefore, anything he did to reveal his true identity wouldn\u2019t cause any problems immediately.</p><br/><p>Having reached this point in his train of thought, he threw his head back and roared, performing a double-handed incantation gesture that was unlike anything he usually did. Immediately, the splendor of his Heaven-Dao Nascent Soul sent spiritual power coursing through his body, nearly an ocean of if that then spilled out into the open.</p><br/><p>That spiritual power immediately transformed into frigid coldness. Cracking sounds rang out in all directions as the area around Bai Xiaochun froze over! The entire area instantly became like a frozen lake!</p><br/><p>This was none other than\u2026 the Frigid School Will-Evolving Incantation!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had never dared to use this divine ability, not even with the power of his mask to disguise what it was. But now, madness flickered in his eyes as frigid qi poured out around him. Then, he extended his right hand and pointed at Lei Shan, who was already being slowed down because of the frigid coldness!</p><br/><p>\u201cSeal!\u201d Bai Xiaochun shouted. All of the frigid qi in the area exploded into motion toward Lei Shan. It took only a moment to completely inundate him, covering him with frost so rapidly that, a moment later, he was completely covered with a layer of sealing ice.</p><br/><p>More cracking sounds rang out over the course of the following few breaths of time. Soon, Lei Shan was covered with multiple layers of ice. Although he struggled, with each layer that he damaged, more layers piled on top, until he was like an enormous ice statue!!</p><br/><p>He was a huge chunk of ice hovering in midair, hundreds of meters tall, completely unmoving. Of course, closer inspection would reveal many cracks filling the ice; clearly, the sealing would only last for a short time.</p><br/><p>Although Mistress Red-Dust was shocked by what she was seeing, the technique didn't actually make her think of Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiaochun, he threw his head back and roared in shocking fashion as his fleshly body power spiked dramatically. Intense fluctuations rolled out in all directions, along with shocking energy.</p><br/><p>Everything in the area shook violently, and small pebbles began to rise up into the air. Even some enormous rocks began to float up into the air. Fissures appeared on some nearby low-lying mountains, and they began to collapse into rubble, which also floated up into the air.</p><br/><p>Moments later, large boulders began to rise up, almost as if Bai Xiaochun\u2019s body had become a black hole dragging everything toward him.</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUMBLE!!</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the rocks began to form up around Bai Xiaochun, layer upon layer. A 300-meter tall giant appeared\u2026 right there in the middle of the Wildlands!</p><br/><p>This was none other than\u2026 the Living Mountain Incantation!!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun hadn\u2019t dared to use this technique in the Wildlands up to this point. But now was not the time to worry about such things. Fueling it with the power of his cultivation base, he grew larger and larger until he was not 300 meters tall, but rather, more than 2,100 meters tall!!</p><br/><p>Although he currently wasn\u2019t powerful enough to literally shake all of heaven and earth, he certainly came close to that level. His fleshly body power combined with the Living Mountain Incantation put him at his very peak!</p><br/><p>Since he was currently incapable of unleashing the Undying Emperor\u2019s Fist, he needed to close some of the gap between his own level and Lei Shan\u2019s, and this was the only way!</p><br/><p>\u201cGet ready to die!\u201d he shouted through the mouth of the gigantic stone golem. With that, he lunged forward to bash at the sealed Lei Shan!</p><br/><p>This was none other than\u2026 the Mountain Shaking Bash!!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun couldn't bother to conceal the effects of the Mountain Shaking Bash. He unleashed all of the explosive power he was capable of, becoming something like a stone beast that lunged forward with astonishing madness.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the cracks in the ice had grown more plentiful. Even as Bai Xiaochun closed in, the ice suddenly exploded!!</p><br/><p>Lei Shan burst out into the open right as Bai Xiaochun arrived, incarnated as the stone golem giant from the Living Mountain Incantation.</p><br/><p>The moment of collision caused a boom that shook everything in the area. The heavenly bodies went dim, and doughty Lei Shan was flung backward violently, leaving loud cracking sounds echoing behind him. However, things weren\u2019t over yet. Relying on the power of the Living Mountain Incantation and the divine ability of the Mountain Shaking Bash, Bai Xiaochun continued forward, reaching out with his thumb and index finger. As he did, black light appeared, and he pinched his fingers together in the direction of Lei Shan\u2019s throat!</p><br/><p>This was none other than\u2026 the Throat Crushing Grasp!!</p><br/><p>Although all of this takes a bit of time to describe, it actually happened in the briefest of moments. Starting with the Frigid School Will-Evolving Incantation, he had quickly and smoothly unleashed a whole series of techniques. And now, as the Throat Crushing Grasp bore down onto Lei Shan, he howled and threw his hands out in front of him to block the thumb and index finger of the stone golem that was Bai Xiaochun!!</p><br/><p>Cracking sounds rang out from inside of Lei Shan, and the black light in his eyes grew stronger. Even as he fought back, Bai Xiaochun went all out to unleash the power of the Throat Crushing Grasp.</p><br/><p>Then, he unhesitatingly jerked his hand to the side, sending Lei Shan flying down toward the ground, where he slammed into the dirt and opened up a huge crater. Before Lei Shan could react, Bai Xiaochun dropped down and delivered ten fist strikes in quick succession!</p><br/><p>The ground quaked as fissures and crevices snaked out from within the crater.</p><br/><p>At that point, another shocking howl erupted out from within the crater as Lei Shan blocked Bai Xiaochun's final fist strike. The backlash sent Bai Xiaochun's fist swinging backward, and yet, Lei Shan was now covered in wounds, his hair in disarray and black blood seeping out all over his body. However, the black light in his eyes caused his fleshly body power to rocket once again to new heights.</p><br/><p>Even as he prepared to leap up into the air, a mark suddenly appeared on the forehead of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s stone golem form. Meanwhile, inside the golem, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s true self likewise had a mark on his forehead, which opened up\u2026 into a third eye!</p><br/><p>The Heavenspan Dharma Eye!!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the power of that third eye erupted out from the stone golem\u2019s forehead, and latched onto Lei Shan!!</p><br/><p>Lei Shan shivered as an indescribable force enveloped him, taking control of his entire body! His pupils quivered as he was suddenly stuck in place in midair, unable to move!</p><br/><p>In that exact moment, Bai Xiaochun sent his stone golem form leaping up. A roar could be heard as he then reached out and slapped Lei Shan, sending him hurtling back toward the ground!!</p><br/><p>As the blow landed, Bai Xiaochun unleashed his\u2026 Undying Hex!!</p><br/><p>The Undying Hex became countless black threads that flowed out from his palm and into Lei Shan. As Lei Shan slammed down into the crater below, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s stone golem form collapsed, sending numerous rocks and boulders falling down. Within the space of a few breaths of time, those rocks covered Lei Shan as surely as a mountain!!</p><br/><p>Inside of the mountain, black threads swirled, completely locking Lei Shan in place!!</p><br/><p>Having accomplished these things, Bai Xiaochun staggered backward a few paces before retreating to the heavenly airship. There, Mistress Red-Dust stood, her mouth agape as Bai Xiaochun took control of the ship and sent it screaming through the air like some wild beast!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

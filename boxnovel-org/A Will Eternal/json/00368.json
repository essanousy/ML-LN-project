This is wrong!\u201d The red-haired old man from the Starry River Court was trembling from the enormity of the situation. After all, the Starry River Court would be hard pressed to deal with a furious Dao River Court and Polarity River Court.</p><br/><p>In fact, it was now possible to tell that only about a third of the anger of those two sects was directed at the River-Defying Sect, with the rest being reserved for the Starry River Court!</p><br/><p>Therefore, the only option left for them was to try to drag the River-Defying Sect down too.</p><br/><p>However, even as the words left his mouth, the sky above began to shake, and a gigantic, blinding figure of light appeared out of thin air. Instantly, intense pressure weighed down, and the lands began to quake. All of the Nascent Soul cultivators immediately clasped hands and bowed formally.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Emissary!\u201d</p><br/><p>The figure of light looked at the temple in the middle of the stone spell formation, but despite the level of his cultivation base, he wasn't able to see exactly what was happening inside. Of course, he didn\u2019t really care about that. Although a divine ability was being secretly imparted to a legacy successor, that in itself wasn\u2019t a major incident. The Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect had a total of 300 secret legacies, and all of them were shocking in power. With the exception of a few dozen that were particularly powerful, it was hard to determine which ones were stronger than the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I remember, the Living Mountain Incantation is rated in the top ten among the secret legacies. Unfortunately, it\u2019s far too difficult to cultivate, which is why it's virtually unheard of to see anyone use it.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, it's been tens of thousands of years since this arcane pocket realm was tamed and this secret legacy was left behind in it.\u201d The gigantic figure of light waved his hand, and ripples spread out across the sky like waves rolling across a sea.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday,\u201d he said, his voice rumbling like thunder, \u201csomeone has mastered the Living Mountain Incantation. Listen ye of the four great sects: within a month, inscribe this person\u2019s information onto a jade slip and deliver it to the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect to be kept on file!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, the figure began to fade away. The only reason he had come was because he had sensed the Living Mountain Incantation taking form. Having accomplished his task, he immediately returned to the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect.</p><br/><p>As the enormous glowing giant disappeared, the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Starry River Court sat there with faces as pale as death. No longer did they try to accuse the River-Defying Sect of cheating. No matter what had occurred within the legacy zone, the emissary's words had to be accepted as fact!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun of the River-Defying Sect had obtained a complete legacy, and had gained enlightenment of the Living Mountain Incantation!</p><br/><p>Crimsonsoul, Frigidsect and Master Godwind exchanged glances, and could immediately see the excitement in each other\u2019s eyes. They even seemed to be sitting up a bit straighter than before.</p><br/><p>The Dao River Court and the Polarity River Court sat there in taciturn silence for a moment. Then, they both took the initiative to approach the River-Defying Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cCongratulations, Fellow Daoist Frigidsect. Hahaha! The junior patriarch of your honored sect has gained enlightenment of the Living Mountain Incantation, and even attracted the attention of the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect. In the future, he will surely rise to tremendous heights!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist Crimsonsoul, now I understand why you were so confident earlier. This kid Bai Xiaochun is really extraordinary! Now that I think about it, he really stuck out to me back when we came to visit you before. He\u2019s like a dragon amongst men!\u201d</p><br/><p>These Nascent Soul Daoist masters weren\u2019t currying favor. Rather, they were worried about how to explain the matter when they got back to the sect, and were hoping that the River-Defying Sect would bend the rules and not take all of their resources....</p><br/><p>Frigidsect, Crimsonsoul and Master Godwind were adept schemers, and knew exactly how to handle the situation. Suppressing their excitement, they decided not to mention anything about the resources.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaochun is a naughty and mischievous kid,\u201d Frigidsect said. \u201cWe\u2019re just as worried as you are about what\u2019s going on inside the legacy zone.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Dao and Polarity River Courts knew exactly what was being implied when the first thing Frigidsect mentioned was Bai Xiaochun\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to send messages into and out of the legacy zone, so it's hard to say what's going on. But don\u2019t worry, Fellow Daoist Frigidsect. The matter of the legacy seals is over. Everyone will be teleported out within the time it takes an incense stick to burn.\u201d</p><br/><p>Having heard this, Frigidsect, Crimsonsoul and Master Godwind were much relieved, and even began to chat randomly with the other patriarchs. As for the group from the Starry River Court, they sat off to the side, their faces ashen as they ignored the other sects.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, back in the legacy zone, now that Bai Xiaochun had absorbed all of the sealing marks, the defensive magics faded away. There was no crushing pressure, no lightning, no black winds or seas of flame. In the blink of an eye, they were all gone.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was completely absorbed in the Living Mountain Incantation, when suddenly Bruiser bumped him. Looking around, he realized that none of the defensive spells were in operation, and the cultivators of the three sects were about 3,000 meters away from him, their eyes flickering with cold fury.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe defensive spells are gone?\u201d Bai Xiaochun shivered, and then subconsciously took a few steps back. The looks being given him by the three sects caused his hair to stand on end.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey there, Fellow Daoists! You know, we're all Middle Reaches sects. We\u2019re on the same team....\u201d Even as he stammered an explanation, the cultivators of the three sects began to walk wordlessly in his direction, the coldness in their eyes flaring.</p><br/><p>Backing up, he continued, \u201cKilling people isn\u2019t allowed! Don\u2019t do anything impulsive, okay? You definitely don\u2019t want to fly off the handle....\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart was pounding. He could tell that their tempers had been riled up to the point of detonation. Plus, not only did they need to vent their frustration, they also coveted his turtle-wok.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit,\u201d he thought. \u201cwhy did the defensive spells suddenly vanish?\u201d Trembling and on the verge of tears, he continued to back up.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen, Fellow Daoists, you guys all have big teams, but I\u2019m all alone. Getting the sealing marks was just a matter of luck. I know you\u2019re feeling frustrated, but you were doing the best you could! Don\u2019t be sore losers! Come on, Fellow Daoists, let's all calm down. I really didn\u2019t do it on purpose....\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprisingly, some of the other cultivators actually listened to his words and stopped walking. After all, the matter was over now, and fighting about it wouldn't solve any problems. However, it was still difficult to rid themselves of the fury which existed in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Seeing that his words were having some effect, Bai Xiaochun breathed a sigh of relief. He was well aware that this was not the time to get people riled up. Although it was true that anyone who killed someone else would be executed in punishment, if he lost his poor little life in the process, what good would that do\u2026?</p><br/><p>Just when he was about to continue offering some consolation, the little turtle suddenly flew up and landed on top of his head. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart instantly began to pound with a feeling of impending doom. Before he could say or do anything, the little turtle cleared its throat and then shouted, \u201cIt seems you people just don\u2019t understand. Listen, I\u2019ll explain what my master just said in a clearer way. What he actually means is that you people are a bunch of moronic noobs. How dare you try to fight with my Bai Xiaochun? Stop gawking and screw the hell off!\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice was so loud that no one could possibly not hear him. The cultivators of the three sects who had just been calming down suddenly felt their rage burning hotter than ever.</p><br/><p>That was especially true of the people from the Starry River Court, who immediately devolved into madness. Chen Yunshan was the first to give voice to his rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill Bai Xiaochun! If we work together, we can completely exterminate him. As long as we do it together, there\u2019s no way our sects are going to do anything about it!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat wok of his is a precious treasure!</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him, and maybe the legacy seals inside of him will be available for the taking again!\u201d Although nobody quite agreed with Chen Yunshan\u2019s assessment of the situation, their killing intent was bursting. The rage which they had been suppressing had been ignited by the little turtle\u2019s words!</p><br/><p>Instantly, shouts of fury rose up as dozens of Core Formation cultivators all flew into the air toward Bai Xiaochun. It was a majestic sight as they unleashed all sorts of magical techniques in a deadly attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant at all!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun shrieked as he took to flight. He was no fool, and knew that no matter how strong he was, his Undying Heavenly King Core and Heaven-Dao Gold Core couldn\u2019t stand up to dozens and dozens of Earth Core Chosen all at the same time.</p><br/><p>As for being screwed over by the little turtle, it only caused the hatred in his heart to grow. Tears were on the verge of leaking out of the corners of his eyes. Even as dozens of crazed enemies closed in, the little turtle popped its head out and shouted, \u201cBring it on you idiotic weaklings! My master can beat you all single-handedly. Bring it on! If you think you have what it takes, then fight!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou shut up!\u201d Bai Xiaochun shouted. Then he reached out, grabbed the little turtle, and hurled him backward toward the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill him, alright!?\u201d he screamed. \u201cHe's the one who said it, not me!\u201d The turtle shot through the air so quickly that nobody could possibly evade him, and with a smacking sound, he banged into the face of one of the cultivators from the Starry River Court.</p><br/><p>The cultivator was hit so hard that it nearly knocked his teeth out, and as he staggered backward, the black silhouette of a turtle could be seen on his cheek, complete with four limbs, a head, a tail, and a turtle shell.</p><br/><p>Then the little turtle whizzed through the air back to Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d he said, looking very proud of himself. \u201cIs Lord Turtle awesome or what? Hmph! When Lord Turtle leaves his mark somewhere, not even a demigod can erase it. A demigod! Did you hear that, you little punk? You\u2019re going to have Lord Turtle\u2019s mark on your face for all eternity!\u201d</p><br/><p>The cultivator reached up and felt the black mark on his face, and to his horror, realized that he really couldn\u2019t wipe it away. Heart filling with even more anger than before, he spat the blood out of his mouth and once again began to chase after Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>--</p><br/><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Deathblade.<strong> Chinese language consultant:</strong> ASI a.k.a.

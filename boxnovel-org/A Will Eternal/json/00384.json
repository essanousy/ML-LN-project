Would you be willing to part with it for 100,000 merit points, Brother Bai?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not for sale,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, rolling his eyes. With that, he flew off of the crocodile, then swished his sleeve, causing it to fly into his spirit beast bag. Just as he was about to step into his spirit abode, Zhou Tao moved to block his way.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Bai, if you don't want to sell the formula, that's fine. But would you be willing to let the Celestial Sky Society be the exclusive dealer for your pill?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExclusive dealer?\u201d Bai Xiaochun looked at Zhou Tao for a moment. The truth was that going out to sell the pills on his own over the past few days had been a bit troublesome. If this Zhou Tao could do that for him, it would definitely save some effort.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Celestial Sky Society virtually runs Sky City,\u201d Zhou Tao said with a smile. \u201cTherefore, I am very confident that within a few short months, we could get your Ultra Fasting Aid Pill to every corner of the city. By that point, you would be able to make a huge profit without having to do any of the grunt work yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun thought about it for a moment, and then began to discuss the particulars with Zhou Tao. Two hours passed, and they finally agreed that the Celestial Sky Society would buy the pills for 300 merit points, resell them at a higher price, and then split any subsequent profits 50/50. Bai Xiaochun almost felt like he was taking advantage of them, but Zhou Tao seemed quite pleased. Smiling, they swore a Dao oath and recorded it on a jade slip, which they then sent to the Justice Bureau of the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect to make the deal official.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, Zhou Tao smiled and asked, \u201cBrother Bai, might I know your illustrious given name? Since we\u2019re partners now, I\u2019d like to know a bit more about you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun stuck his chin up, waved his sleeve and loftily said, \u201cYou can just call me Apothecary Bai.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a brief moment of hesitation, Zhou Tao smiled again and then took his leave.</p><br/><p>In the following days, Bai Xiaochun went crazy concocting medicine. Furthermore, he increased his daily quota from 50 pills to 100.</p><br/><p>That was his limit. Every time Zhou Tao came to collect the pills, he would simply hand over 30,000 merit points. As for the extra money from the profits, that would come later, after all sales were finalized.</p><br/><p>Another seven days went by in a flash. During that time, the Celestial Sky Society\u2019s hard work ensured that the Ultra Fasting Aid Pill created a huge stir in the east district. The entire place was thrown into an uproar, and the cultivators there were going crazy. Although the prices were quite high, many cultivators bought them, and soon, the spirit food market began to drop.</p><br/><p>Before long, virtually all of the cultivators in the east district were talking about Ultra Fasting Aid Pills. Furthermore, the Celestial Sky Society made a point of crediting Apothecary Bai. As a result, virtually everyone in east district knew that the Ultra Fasting Aid Pills were concocted by Apothecary Bai, with the Celestial Sky Society cultivators being nothing more than dealers representing him.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun found something odd about that, but didn\u2019t do anything to stop them from spreading his name. Eventually, Zhou Tao came to share the merit point profits, which was a sum of tens of thousands. When he said that such profits would only continue to increase, Bai Xiaochun got more excited than ever.</p><br/><p>Of course, what Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t know was that after the Celestial Sky Society got the Ultra Fasting Aid Pills, their apothecary spared absolutely no cost or effort to turn the 100 pills into 3,000. Because of that, the negative side effects grew even more extreme!</p><br/><p>Over the course of the past week, Bai Xiaochun had given them 700 pills, but they had turned that into over 20,000 pills to sell. Furthermore, they didn\u2019t just sell them in the east district, they also sent them to the west, south, and north districts. As for Bai Xiaochun, there was no way for him to catch wind of that in the short time which had passed.</p><br/><p>For the first time, Bai Xiaochun had more than 200,000 merit points saved up. Excited, he finally decided to spend 100,000 of them to become an orange-robed disciple.</p><br/><p>The new clothing was very comfortable, and as he went around on his battle beast, he felt extremely grand. With his Ultra Fasting Aid Pill, he could easily dominate everything under heaven. However, even as he proceeded along down the street looking down upon all creation with haughtiness, he suddenly heard someone scream. Shocked, he stood up on his battle beast and craned his neck to see a cultivator off in the distance, writhing on the ground as his flesh rapidly withered up.</p><br/><p>Before he could even react, more people in the crowd suddenly fell to the ground, screaming as their bodies began to wither. Bai Xiaochun instantly started to get nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Is the city under attack!?\u201d He immediately sent his battle beast rushing back toward his spirit abode. Along the way, he was astonished to discover that dozens of people were falling to the ground and withering up. In fact, he even noticed that one of them was a cultivator who had bought his pill in the past. More than ever, he now felt that something strange was going on.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, things were only getting started. The next day, even more people in the east district were suddenly struck with incredible, explosive levels of hunger. More than a hundred people were affected, and already, the news was spreading like wildfire.</p><br/><p>Although no one had died yet, all of them ended up with damaged vital energy. Some could recover after a bit of rest, but for others, the injuries were more serious.</p><br/><p>Of course, the wrath of the cultivators was aroused, and as people began to look into the situation, it quickly became apparent that everyone who had been struck with sudden hunger and gauntness, without a single exception, had consumed an Ultra Fasting Aid Pill.</p><br/><p>In terms of how serious the injuries to vital energy were, nobody paid much attention. As far as everyone was concerned, that didn\u2019t matter. Furthermore, thanks to the whisperings of certain individuals, people quickly began to lay the blame on Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese Ultra Fasting Aid Pills are fake!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApothecary Bai is a swindler!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Things are already bad enough here, I can\u2019t believe someone would stoop to conning us! If there weren\u2019t strict rules here, I\u2019d personally go and kill Apothecary Bai!!\u201d</p><br/><p>More and more people began to fall to the symptoms. As for the friends and family of the victims, as well as they other cultivators who weren\u2019t affected, they all began to simmer with rage. Of course, there were people egging them on secretly, attempting to sway public opinion and stoke the fury which was building in the east district.</p><br/><p>The anger quickly began to transform into killing intent, and despite Bai Xiaochun being a Gold Core cultivator, this wasn\u2019t the River-Defying Sect. This was the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, a place where he was a stranger. Furthermore, he had nobody to protect him, and as such, the rising anger being directed toward him filled him with a sensation of deadly crisis!</p><br/><p>It soon reached the point where he was nearly scared out of his mind. Thankfully, he had experienced similar situations in the Spirit Stream Sect and the Blood Stream Sect, so before anything could actually happen, he packed his bags and fled into the night.</p><br/><p>Now that he was descending from the high of suddenly having so many merit points, it occurred to him that he had been well played by the Celestial Sky Society.</p><br/><p>\u201cDamn you, Celestial Sky Society!! I didn't do anything to offend you people!\u201d Gritting his teeth, he sped along under the cover of darkness, feeling very sorry for himself, and at the same time, extremely irritated.</p><br/><p>To have been schemed against and then toyed with in such a matter was a huge loss of face, and the anger in his eyes soon began to burn brightly. Of course, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to just flee without getting to the bottom of the situation. Not daring to go confront anyone from the Celestial Sky Society, he found some of the people who had been struck by side effects, and did a bit of research of his own. Soon, he understood the truth.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Ultra Fasting Aid Pills these people consumed were altered. They weren\u2019t the pills I gave to the Celestial Sky Society! My pills might have some impurities, but the side effects should have been limited to minor damage to vital energy. Nothing that a bit of rest couldn\u2019t fix! Something that minor would be worth it in exchange for half a month without being hungry and having your energy drained!</p><br/><p>\u201cBut the Celestial Sky Society changed my spirit medicine and made it far more harmful. They even reduced the effectiveness!!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would they do something like that!?\u201d Gritting his teeth, he drew upon the power of his cultivation base to flee the east district and go to the north district. However, after arriving, it was to his shock that he found that there were also people there who had been harmed by consuming Ultra Fasting Aid Pills. By this point, a thought struck him like lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it. The Celestial Sky Society is the most powerful organization in Sky City, and they control most of the shops and stores. The biggest profits in the city come from spirit food, and the Ultra Fasting Aid Pill struck a huge blow to the spirit food industry!</p><br/><p>\u201cThey came to me, not to work together to sell pills, but to completely destroy the reputation of my Ultra Fasting Aid Pill!!\u201d The more he came to understand what had occurred, the angrier he got.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell isn\u2019t this interesting. They didn\u2019t use magic or try to assassinate me, they schemed their way to victory! Well, Bai Xiaochun can play that game too! You just wait, Celestial Sky Society. You just wait!!\u201d Gritting his teeth, he settled down in the north district.</p><br/><p>--</p><br/><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Deathblade.<strong> Chinese language consultant:</strong> ASI a.k.a.

As he passed, he looked over and smiled, and she nodded in return.</p><br/><p>Despite the faint smile on his face, when he spoke, the voice of a fiendish monster echoed out from his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind again, Bai Xiaochun. After I catch you, I\u2019m going to starve you for a month, then put you in with a flock of phoenixes and a horde of wild beasts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhou Xinqi\u2019s eyes went wide, and at the same time, a miserable scream could be heard coming from Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cHelp me, Uncle Li! Save me, dear Elder Brother Sect Leader! I don\u2019t want to starve! I don't want to get locked up with phoenixes and wild beasts....\u201d Bai Xiaochun was trembling in fear as he conjured mental images of the scenes described by Elder Zhou. Screaming, he shot forward with incredible speed, transforming into nothing more than a shadow.</p><br/><p>Up ahead, Lu Tianlei sped along in lightning form. Although the early stages of the path had been easy for him, things had slowly grown more and more difficult. The area he currently faced was filled with razor-sharp wind blades, and if he proceeded too quickly, it would cause them to fly toward him.</p><br/><p>He had summoned a puppet moments before, and sent it ahead as a test, but because it moved too quickly, it was instantly slashed to pieces by the wind blades. Because of that, Lu Tianlei knew that he had no other option than to slow down. Only after finding the proper equilibrium would he be able to continue moving forward.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyou was so far ahead he wasn\u2019t even visible. Given his consummate level of talent, he had been able to transform into emptiness and then pass through the area effortlessly. The wind blades didn\u2019t so much as touch him. Lu Tianlei, who had previously believed himself to be on an equal level with Shangguan Tianyou, was left with hatred seething in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if you possess void magic?\u201d Lu Tianlei thought. \u201cWhat\u2019s so amazing about that? Just wait till I get past this area... I\u2019ll definitely catch up and take first place!\u201d By this point, Lu Tianlei didn\u2019t even think of Zhou Xinqi as being worthy of note. The only thing he cared about was overtaking Shangguan Tianyou and winning first place.</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, he stepped out into the wind blade zone and prepared to pick up speed. But then, a blast of wind could be heard behind him.</p><br/><p>The deafening sound caused all of the flying wind blades to tremble. When Lu Tianlei saw that, he smiled in delight.</p><br/><p>\u201cHah! It\u2019s definitely Zhou Xinqi. What a moron. If she enters this area going that fast, all the wind blades will head in her direction. I should take advantage of that moment to charge forward!\u201d Looking back, he saw someone skinny racing toward him as fast as lightning. As soon as the person entered the area with the wind blades, he was already a third of the way through, placing him only about 3,000 meters away from Lu Tianlei.</p><br/><p>Because of his incredible speed, it only took the blink of an eye for countless wind blades to swirl together into an enormous cyclone.</p><br/><p>At first, he gasped, shocked by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s speed. But then, he began to chuckle inwardly. \u201cIt\u2019s not Zhou Xinqi? Well, it doesn\u2019t matter. He\u2019s moving way too fast. Is he looking to get killed?! When practicing cultivation, one should rely on one\u2019s wits!\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughing, Lu Tianlei watched as the wind blades grouped together. At the same time, he gathered the lightning which surrounded him, preparing to make a break for the exit.</p><br/><p>Before he could pick up any speed, the screaming Bai Xiaochun continued onward without slowing down at all. Rumbling sounds echoed out as he actually picked up speed.</p><br/><p>There were so many wind blades it was impossible to tell how many there were. And yet, when they slammed into Bai Xiaochun, silver light flashed, and to Lu Tianlei\u2019s shock, they all shattered.</p><br/><p>Countless wind blades fell to pieces, and by the time they reformed, Bai Xiaochun had flown past Lu Tianlei.</p><br/><p>Of course, the wind blades wouldn\u2019t let him by so easily, and began to race to catch up.</p><br/><p>Lu Tianlei\u2019s jaw dropped and his eyes went wide. Then, his scalp went numb and his mind began to spin.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!!\u201d he said in a hoarse voice. Before the countless wind blades could catch up to Bai Xiaochun\u2026 he was gone.</p><br/><p>The wind blades shuddered to a stop angrily, then slowly turned toward Lu Tianlei....</p><br/><p>Heart pounding, Lu Tianlei immediately slowed down. However, having been completely frustrated by Bai Xiaochun, the wind blades didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment to pounce on him.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo... NO!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Moments later, miserable shrieks began to ring out.</p><br/><p>As he ran on up ahead, Bai Xiaochun was a bit surprised to hear the bloodcurdling screams behind him. However, there was no time for him to look back. Elder Zhou seemed to be right behind him, bellowing in rage, leaving Bai Xiaochun with no choice but to charge onward, jaw clenched, expression pained.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Elder Zhou was able to rescue Lu Tianlei from the countless swirling wind blades. If he had come a moment later, Lu Tianlei, whose clothing was now ripped to shreds, would most likely have been left with no other choice than to forfeit.</p><br/><p>Eyes bloodshot, Lu Tianlei finally realized who Bai Xiaochun was. Voice filled with rage, he bellowed, \u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unaware that he had unwittingly caused yet another person to hate him, Bai Xiaochun moved on at top speed, passing through numerous empty areas. After enough time passed for half an incense stick to burn, he caught sight of the end of the bridge up ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm finally near the end!\u201d he thought excitedly. What he didn\u2019t notice was that there was someone else near the end, trodding forward one step at a time.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyou was panting. Most of the path had been very easy for him, with the difficulty rising only at the very end.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe this place suppresses spiritual power and also has such crushing pressure!\u201d A brutal gleam appeared in his eyes as he proceeded forward. The spiritual power in the area was locked down tight, and there was also huge pressure. He felt like there was a mountain resting on his shoulders, and even more shocking was that with every step he took, it felt like an entire additional mountain was added. Although there were only a total of a hundred steps to take, the difficulty was intense, and he was left trembling physically. He was already quickly approaching his limit.</p><br/><p>The closer he got to the end, the greater the pressure grew, and the more mountains he felt building up on him. Eventually, he reached the point where he had only ten more steps to take. However, those ten steps seemed almost insurmountable.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyou took a deep breath, and determination flickered in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first place spot in the qualifying round belongs to me. I'm going to get into the Chosen battles, and I'm going to take first place there, too! After I get into the Inner Sect, then my future will be in the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s Legacy Echelon!\u201d Gritting his teeth, he was just about to take another step when he sensed something behind him, and turned to see Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s him....\u201d There were few people on the south bank who didn\u2019t know Bai Xiaochun. Although Shangguan Tianyou had never met him personally, he had attended his funeral and seen his portrait. The fact that Bai Xiaochun was directly behind him was somewhat of a surprise; he had assumed it would be Lu Tianlei.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems I thought a bit too much of Lu Tianlei. What a useless fool.\u201d Looking away, Shangguan Tianyou completely ignored Bai Xiaochun. As far as he was concerned, he was on a completely different level than Bai Xiaochun. Lifting his foot and stepping forward, he heard creaking sounds emanating from his bones.</p><br/><p>However, even as he took that single step. Bai Xiaochun also took a step forward. When he felt nothing, he took a second step, and then a third and a fourth....</p><br/><p>Soon he had taken fifty steps, whereupon he stopped and looked up into the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why do I feel heavier?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was at this point that Shangguan Tianyou trembled and put his foot down, having completed one single step. Having taken over ninety steps, he felt like he was on the verge of collapse. He was out of breath, but his expression was one of satisfaction. Then he looked back and saw Bai Xiaochun standing there, having taken fifty steps.</p><br/><p>His eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow... how is he moving so fast!?\u201d Looking shocked, he quickly gritted his teeth. \u201cHe must be a body refinement cultivator. That will help him move more quickly at the beginning. But toward the end, things will get more difficult for him. He--\u201d Before Shangguan Tianyou could finish his train of thought, a tremor ran through him, and he looked on in shock as Bai Xiaochun suddenly began to run.</p><br/><p>\u201cRun... he\u2019s... he\u2019s running?\u201d Shangguan Tianyou watched wide-eyed as Bai Xiaochun trotted up to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, why are you going so slow?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked. Looking over his shoulder, he saw no sign of Elder Zhou, and finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou... don\u2019t feel like there are mountains on your back?\u201d Shangguan Tianyou asked without even thinking about it, his eyelids twitching.</p><br/><p>\u201cMountains?\u201d Bai Xiaochun jumped up and down a few times. \u201cEee? Hm, yeah a few, but I can hardly feel them.\u201d Shangguan Tianyou gasped in disbelief.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun continued to jump up and down a few times, but then suddenly, he saw Elder Zhou off in the distance. With a shriek, he suddenly shot forward through the final nine steps, taking him off of the bridge\u2026. Then his speed increased dramatically, and he was gone from sight.</p><br/><p>When that happened, Elder Zhou finally slowed down and then began to chuckle wryly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun... actually took first place?\u201d</p><br/><p>Simultaneously, back on the balcony, Zheng Yuandong, Li Qinghou, and everyone else shot to their feet, strange expressions on their faces. The elders almost couldn\u2019t believe their eyes. Although they had been prepared for a surprising outcome when they saw Bai Xiaochun overtake Zhou Xinqi and Lu Tianlei, the ease with which Bai Xiaochun passed the final section was flabbergasting.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe... took first?\u201d Li Qinghou murmured.</p><br/><p>A moment later, a huge uproar could be heard coming from the disciples who had gathered to watch the qualifying round.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun... passed up Zhou Xinqi, Lu Tianlei and Shangguan Tianyou! He took first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! Bai Xiaochun actually took first!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe only reason he took first was because of Elder Zhou. Anyone would have fled for their life with him chasing them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s face was pale white, and his mind was spinning. His vision began to go dark, as though lightning were crashing in his mind.</p><br/><p>He could only watch as Bai Xiaochun simply walked off of the bridge ahead of him. He began to tremble violently.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201d Shangguan Tianyou\u2019s eyes were completely bloodshot. His pride, his self-respect, everything about him had just been trampled by Bai Xiaochun. Worst of all was how Bai Xiaochun had actually asked him why he was going so slow.</p><br/><p>All of the blood in his body began to rush toward his head, and the sword qi inside of him boiled on the verge of exploding. Eyes crimson, he threw caution to the wind and lurched forward nine steps, after which he coughed up a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun, I, Shangguan Tianyou, did not lose this day. I... refuse to admit defeat. In the Chosen battles, I\u2019ll make sure you realize well and good that among the Outer Sect disciples... nobody can beat me!\u201d Grinding his teeth, he looked off in the direction Bai Xiaochun had disappeared in, eyes bursting with the desire to do battle.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

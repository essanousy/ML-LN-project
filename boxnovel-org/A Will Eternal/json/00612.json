Blood spurted out of his mouth, and he shrieked as he flew backward. He almost looked like he was scared for his life, and in fact, he even pulled out a handful of teleportation talismans.</p><br/><p>However, his eyes continued to dart around; clearly, he still wasn\u2019t convinced that the deva patriarch wasn\u2019t in the area.</p><br/><p>When the clan chief saw that Bai Xiaochun had pulled out a handful of teleportation talismans, and was about to crush them, he let out a defiant roar. On the one hand, he was fairly confident that, considering the current speed he was capable of, he would still be able to catch his quarry again even if he teleported away.</p><br/><p>But\u00a0<em>eight</em> teleportation talismans? In the Wildlands, even a single teleportation talisman was extremely expensive, the type of thing that required Heavenspan River water to acquire.</p><br/><p>The clan chief\u2019s eyes shone with intense killing intent; by now, he wanted to kill Bai Hao more than anything else. Performing a double-handed incantation gesture, he drew on the explosive power of his mid Nascent Soul cultivation base to summon a massive black hole that instantly caused the air in all directions to distort.</p><br/><p>He also sent his divine sense streaming out as he took a step forward, a step that instantly placed him right in front of Bai Xiaochun. Then he reached out with a vicious motion to grab him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you flee to the ends of the earth, I\u2019ll still catch you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>His hand pierced through the air to appear in front of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face. If Bai Xiaochun crushed the talismans to teleport away, the clan chief would likely be able to stop him from getting away, but would be injured in the process.</p><br/><p>From the vicious expression on the clan chief's face, Bai Xiaochun could tell what he was thinking. However, he was used to keeping his cool. Eyes flickering, it was without the slightest hesitation that he crushed the teleportation talismans!</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!</p><br/><p>Even as the clan chief\u2019s hand closed in, the power of teleportation rose up, and Bai Xiaochun vanished. The clan chief grabbed nothing but air.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting away!!\u201d the clan chief roared. Waving his sleeve in fury, he leaped back onto the soulship and once again used the violet banner and the divine will seal to give chase.</p><br/><p>Enough time passed for half an incense stick to burn. Bai Xiaochun was some distance away, racing along and simultaneously contemplating what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there were other people waiting around ready to jump into the fight, they wouldn\u2019t have just sat around and watched me leave.... Don\u2019t tell me that... the clan chief really came after me on his own?\u201d Bai Xiaochun almost couldn\u2019t believe that it was true. The reality of the situation was that although everyone back in the Bai Clan had witnessed him survive the attack of the deva patriarch\u2019s palm, to them, it had seemed like someone in the great circle of Core Formation escaping from a deva by means of a few tricks. In fact, that was how they viewed everything, from the teleportation talismans to the murdersoul spikes.</p><br/><p>The only thing that a Nascent Soul cultivator would have to fear was his twelve-colored flame. And yet, any Nascent Soul cultivator who truly went all out in the fight would probably be able to disregard that as a real threat. Besides, the clan chief was in the mid Nascent Soul stage, and was therefore completely convinced that he would be able to kill him.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was still unsure about the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother thing. Was it really just a coincidence that the clan chief managed to track me down so quickly and accurately\u2026?\u201d Even as he pondered the matter, he suddenly spun in place, his eyes widening. There, off in the distance, was a violet glow, racing toward him at incredible speed. It was none other than the clan chief!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s still chasing me.... Alright, he obviously knows exactly where I am. Not a bit of time was wasted. He must have a way to track me....\u201d His eyes flashed, and his heart thumped with anxiety, but at the same time, he knew that there was no point in fleeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMid Nascent Soul stage.... alright, clan chief, you\u2019re really forcing my hand!\u201d Abandoning thoughts of escaping, Bai Xiaochun roared, drawing on the full power of his fleshly body to prepare to fight. Although it didn't look particularly special, the power of the third level of the Undying Live Forever Technique had long since filled his entire body.</p><br/><p>He was like an explosive dragon in human form! As the clan chief closed in, Bai Xiaochun took a step forward, propelling himself ahead with such lightning-like speed that he became a blur of afterimages.</p><br/><p>And yet, Bai Xiaochun... was still not satisfied with that level of speed!</p><br/><p>\u201cMountain Shaking Bash!\u201d he shouted, using one of the secret magics of the Undying Codex. His already astonishing speed increased, causing rumbling sounds to fill the air as he essentially vanished. When he reappeared, he was right in front of the clan chief, focusing all of the power in his body onto his right hand, which reached out in a grasping motion!</p><br/><p>He was using... the Throat Crushing Grasp!!</p><br/><p>All of this takes a bit of time to describe, but actually happened in the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint. Furthermore, what was occurring seemed completely unbelievable; even the clan chief\u2019s eyes went wide, before settling back into a mask of viciousness.</p><br/><p>\u201cFeeling suicidal?!\u201d His hands flashed in a double-handed incantation gesture before waving wide, which caused a violet shield of light to spring up around him. That shield was a defensive mechanism powered by his cultivation base and bolstered by some magical items. The clan chief\u2019s face was filled with murder and hatred as he then lunged toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour cultivation base might be higher than I\u2019d realized, you unfilial bastard, but I refuse to believe that it's the same with your fleshly body power!!\u201d Even as the clan chief roared, the distance between him and Bai Xiaochun closed.</p><br/><p>From a distance, they looked like two shooting stars, streaking through the sky on a collision course!!</p><br/><p>The moment they collided, heaven-shaking, earth-shattering rumbling swept out. The air shattered as a huge boom filled the air, a deafening noise that vastly surpassed heavenly thunder. There were even rifts torn open left and right.</p><br/><p>An agonized shriek escaped the clan chief\u2019s lips. Blood sprayed out of his mouth as the soulship was sent spinning off to the side, and he tumbled backward head over heels, his hair in complete disarray. Shock and disbelief could be seen on his face as he roared, \u201cYou\u2019re not Bai Hao!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun remained in the spot where they had collided, his body tingling a bit. It had been a long time since he bashed into someone like this, and it was also the first time that he was stricken... by how incredibly powerful his fleshly body was!!</p><br/><p>Not only had bashing into his opponent not hurt, but the tingling sensation it left behind was actually slightly pleasurable. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes immediately began to glow brightly.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no time to sit around enjoying the pleasurable feeling. Seeing that the clan chief had lost the initiative in the fight, Bai Xiaochun took a step forward, smacking his bag of holding to produce Zhou Yixing\u2019s greatbow. Without any hesitation, he took advantage of the initiative he had gained to unleash more than a hundred arrows in a single volley!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t need to summon the arrows himself, all he needed to do was feed some soul power into the bow itself, which would then create the soul arrows. Technically, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation base didn\u2019t operate on soul power, but after his spiritual energy was changed by his mask, it would function the same.</p><br/><p><em>Twang! Twang! Twang! Twang!</em></p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, more than a hundred arrows shot into the air, becoming like a rainfall that could destroy anything it landed on.</p><br/><p>The arrows moved with blinding speed, piercing through the air with rumbling sounds. Before the clan chief could even react, the first arrow was in front of him, where it exploded. Then, the other arrows arrived, all of them exploding in quick succession. The clan chief had no choice other than to anxiously evade the attack.</p><br/><p>However, despite the quickness with which he moved, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes glittered as he opened his Heavenspan Dharma Eye. Instantly, a violet beam of light shot out and landed onto the clan chief.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake control!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun shouted. The clan chief\u2019s heart began to pound with shock as he found that, unexpectedly... he had stopped moving.</p><br/><p>Considering he couldn\u2019t move, there was nothing he could do to evade the force of more than a hundred exploding arrows!!</p><br/><p>The air distorted and the lands quaked, and soon, it was almost impossible to even see the clan chief!</p><br/><p>There was even a nearby mountain that collapsed because of the force of the exploding arrows. However, that was when a shout of complete defiance and anger rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still don't qualify to kill me!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

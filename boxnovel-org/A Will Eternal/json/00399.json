This was something that could not be accomplished by ordinary mid Core Formation cultivators, or even the top chosen of the generation!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, this was the riversource Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, whose chosen vastly surpassed those in the Lower or Middle Reaches. And yet, what Bai Xiaochun was currently doing would shock all such chosen.</p><br/><p>And the might of the Frigid School Will-Evolving Incantation was only just revealing its potential!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis... this is only the Frigid Adept level. When I reach the Frigid Master level....\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes shone with anticipation as he thought back to the description of the technique.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrigid Masters can create a 30,000-meter frigid domain with actual clones! These are just frigid shadows, not true clones!\u201d At this point, he couldn\u2019t help but think about the Frigid Paragon level!</p><br/><p>\u201cFrigid Paragons can even freeze portions of the Heavenspan River!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hands were clenched into fists, and the anticipation in his eyes shone strong and bright. However, this session of cultivation was not yet over, and his breakthrough wasn\u2019t going to be limited to the Frigid School Will-Evolving Incantation. The time had come for his Undying Tendons!</p><br/><p>Next, he looked down at his left leg, the tendons of which had by now been refined to completion, making his leg the strongest part of his entire body by far, and also the most resilient.</p><br/><p>Eyes glittering, he lifted his left foot up and then stomped it back down toward the ground, fueling the motion with all the power of his Undying Tendons. Even before the foot actually made contact, the ground began to quake, sending countless volumes of sand flying up into the air.</p><br/><p>And yet, Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t satisfied. In the moment that his foot made contact with the ground, his eyes flashed, and he said, \u201cUndying Hex!\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless crevices snaked out in all directions, creating something like a natural restrictive spell. In that instant, everything in the area was simultaneously sealed in place and then destroyed. The area around Bai Xiaochun began to collapse, sending massive amounts of dust flying up into the air.</p><br/><p>Sounds like muffled thunder echoed out in all directions, reaching even the inhabited parts of Sky City.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun let out a yelp as tumbled downward through the flying dust and sand. Then, moments later, as the dust settled, he could be seen at the bottom of an enormous, 300-meter-wide crater!</p><br/><p>Covering the crater were countless interlocking golden threads, which were none other than the manifestation of the divine ability which came after the Throat Crushing Grasp and the Mountain Shaking Bash, the Undying Hex!</p><br/><p>It could seal anything and everything!</p><br/><p>At the bottom of the crater, the dust-covered Bai Xiaochun was struggling back to his feet, not sure whether to laugh or cry. He had forgotten that he was in a desert, and that there was only loose sand and dirt beneath his feet. To suddenly tumble down and end up covered in dirt right in the moment of triumph was definitely a loss of face, but after climbing out of the crater and confirming that no one was in the area to see him, he breathed a sigh of relief. Then he composed himself for a moment before transforming into a beam of light that shot back in the direction of the tavern.</p><br/><p>Moments after he left, cultivators from Sky City arrived to see what had caused the commotion. When they caught sight of the 300-meter-wide crater, all of them gasped in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis... this desert was put here by the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, wasn\u2019t it?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo ordinary force could cause this kind of damage here. I can\u2019t believe someone actually managed to create a crater like this. Could it be that one of the famous chosen in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars came down here to do some training?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot even Core Formation cultivators could do something like that. It must have been somebody from the top 1,000 in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars!\u201d When the subject of the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars came up, looks of envy could be seen on the faces of all the cultivators present.</p><br/><p>The Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars were very important in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect; they were an elite group of cultivators under the Nascent Soul stage who were ranked according to power and ability. Anyone on that list could single-handedly shake the eastern cultivation world.</p><br/><p>Even as the discussion about the matter unfolded, a beam of light appeared off in the distance, within which was a handsome young man. He seemed weary and travel-worn, but his eyes shone brightly, and astonishingly, his cultivation base was a step beyond the great circle of Foundation Establishment; he was in the quasi-Core stage!</p><br/><p>A mere glance at him would confirm that by merely crystallizing his spiritual seas, he would step into Core Formation. Although there was always a possibility of failure, considering the fluctuations that rolled off of him, that didn\u2019t seem likely in his case.</p><br/><p>There was also a murderous aura surrounding the young man which, when coupled with the scars on his face, made him seem somewhat unapproachable.</p><br/><p>He was none other than Song Que!</p><br/><p>Back when he had parted ways with Bai Xiaochun, he had immediately gone outside the sect to start working on missions. Lots of them. Nearly a year had passed, and he had faced many potentially fatal situations. However, he had gone all out to complete most of his missions, and had only a few more to go, all of them inside of the necropolis ruins. After accomplishing those missions, he would have a savings of tens of thousands of merit points.</p><br/><p>As he passed through the area, he noticed the crater, and couldn\u2019t help but stop to take a look.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhoever made this crater must be completely extraordinary.... one of these days, I'm going to be just as incredible!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other cultivators looked at him warily. After all, the dangerous gleam in his eye, his murderous aura, and his generally sinister air made him seem like the type of person no one would dare to provoke. He seemed like the person who lived a life surrounded by death.</p><br/><p>When Song Que noticed the looks of fear in their eyes, he was secretly pleased, and even a bit proud. He felt as if he had become a new person in the last year or so, and had become much more powerful. From what he could tell, he was just around the corner from becoming a yellow-robed disciple.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if those other losers had starved to death by now. Hmph!\u201d In his arrogance, he couldn\u2019t help but muse that Master God-Diviner, Xu Baocai, and Big Fatty Zhang were all completely useless. Only Chen Manyao had a bit of potential.</p><br/><p>Of course, the mere thought of Bai Xiaochun caused Song Que to grind his teeth. Bai Xiaochun had crushed him for the first time in the Fallen Sword Abyss, stealing his chance to reach Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment, and that was a source of constant angst, something he would never forget for the rest of his life. And then there were all the things which had occurred in the Blood Stream Sect, which had nearly driven him crazy. Even how things had played out in the River-Defying Sect were almost beyond bearable.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun, you made a fool of me in the Fallen Sword Abyss, twice as badly in the Blood Stream Sect, and three times as badly in the River-Defying Sect. You just never shut up about <em>Que\u2019er this</em> and <em>Que\u2019er that</em>. You just wait until I become a yellow-robed disciple, then I\u2019ll make a fool of you ten times worse than you ever did to me!!\u201d As he spoke, his eyes began to shine even more brightly than before.</p><br/><p>He was completely and utterly confident that he could do exactly as he had planned.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect is a land of good fortune for me. Before coming here, the clan patriarch told me he had full confidence that I would become a Nascent Soul cultivator here!!\u201d Looking down, he tapped his bag of holding to produce a blue command medallion.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t large, but it was very significant. Earlier, when he was outside the sect on a mission, he had run into another cultivator from Sky City who had sold it to him for a hefty sum. It was none other than a command medallion which could be used to enter the necropolis ruins run by the Celestial Sky Society.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhether or not I get enough merit points to become a yellow-robed disciple will depend on how things go in these ruins. Hopefully, I\u2019ll come out with enough to get my promotion, and then I can ascend to the rainbow district!\u201d Having reached this point in his train of thought, his eyes began to burn with passion and anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst, I\u2019ll go scout out the ruins a bit. Then I\u2019ll go make some special preparations to finish the missions.\u201d Smiling, he shot off in the direction of the necropolis entrance.</p><br/><p>Before long, he was closing in on the location, which was when he caught sight of a rather large tavern that had been erected around it.</p><br/><p>He also saw the outside seating area with the tented pavilions, and cultivators bustling about wearing white garments that make them look like waiters.</p><br/><p>A lot of other ordinary disciples could also be seen going into and coming out of the ruins.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, they certainly deserve to be known as the top organization in Sky City. Only the Celestial Sky Society with their deva clan backers could build a tavern like this.\u201d He sighed, eyes gleaming with envy when he thought about how much income the Celestial Sky Society must be making by controlling the area. Sadly, there was nothing he could do about that.</p><br/><p>\u201cI bet they make more in a day than I could save up in a year....\u201d</p><br/><p>He had spent the entire past year outside the sect working on missions, and thus had no idea about what had gone on in the city during that time. Sighing with envy, he produced his Celestial Sky Society medallion and headed toward the tavern.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

There were tens of thousands of people on all of those battleships\u2026 and the majority of them had the blood of the Heavenspan Realm in them.</p><br/><p>Before the Saint-Emperor could react, Bai Xiaochun exclaimed, \u201cAre you addicted to having kids, Master Snortsnort? You were like this in the Wildlands, and now here in the Eternal Immortal Domains, you\u2019re, you\u2019re\u2026 you\u2019re still up to the same thing! You\u2019ve sired an entire sect!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was simply bowled over. He had once thought Bruiser was impressive, but could see now that Bruiser only qualified to kowtow to Master God-Diviner. The sudden revelation was like a lightning bolt striking from a blue sky.</p><br/><p>Then Bai Xiaochun thought about how much trouble it was dealing with only a couple women, whereas Master God-Diviner had tens of thousands to handle\u2026. It seemed they all got along, which filled Bai Xiaochun with mixed emotions, primarily envy.</p><br/><p>Master God-Diviner looked a bit embarrassed, and was trying to think of what to say when the Grand Heavenmaster arrived with the other powerful experts from the city. When they saw the Saint-Emperor, they were shocked, and although they weren\u2019t sure why he had come, they quickly offered formal greetings. Then they escorted Master God-Diviner and Lu Yuntao, as well as the tens of thousands of people they had brought with them, into Arch-Emperor City.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked on, his head spinning. All of a sudden, he thought back to how Master God-Diviner had seemed to want to say something back when he left, and the pieces clicked. Clearly, bringing a family of tens of thousands on a big journey like this had not been an easy task.</p><br/><p>On the upside, the shocking arrival of Master God-Diviner had eased some of the tension between Bai Xiaochun and the Saint-Emperor. Considering that Master God-Diviner and the other important officials had already seen that the Saint-Emperor had come for a visit, Bai Xiaochun decided that he might as well invite him down into the imperial palace.</p><br/><p>However, the Saint-Emperor was still feeling shaken by the incident with Master God-Diviner. After confirming that the little turtle was not present, he sat down in the imperial palace in Arch-Emperor City to chat further with Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Bro, what did you call that fellow? Master Snortsnort? Now that\u2019s what I called talent! He single-handedly sired an entire sect! Do you mind letting me take this Master Snortsnort back with me, Second Bro? Talent like that is sadly missing in the Saint-Emperor Dynasty!\u201d The Saint-Emperor was truly moved at how this Master Snortsnort had apparently managed to keep such a huge family all happy and harmonious.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t very pleased by the Saint-Emperor\u2019s reaction. And he was also feeling a bit envious of Master God-Diviner and his abilities. It was all made worse by the bitterness he had endured because of his own Daoist partners.</p><br/><p>If the Saint-Emperor hadn\u2019t asked to take Master God-Diviner away, he might have been able to keep a lid on his feelings. But now he was feeling quite irritated.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think that\u2019s impressive? Well, it doesn\u2019t quite measure up to me.\u201d With that, he slapped his bag of holding, causing heaps of love letters to whoosh out, forming a small mountain in front of the Saint-Emperor.</p><br/><p>Feeling much better, Bai Xiaochun proudly said, \u201cSee these love letters? Each and every one is addressed to me! Back in the Heavenspan Realm, all I had to do was nod, and I would have exponentially more wives and concubines than Master God-Diviner!\u201d</p><br/><p>To see Bai Xiaochun casually toss out a so many love letters caused the Saint-Emperor to be completely astonished all over again. Some of the letters in the pile were actually yellow with age\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you actually kept them all\u2026? They even survived the destruction of your entire world\u2026?\u201d The Saint-Emperor suddenly felt like his understanding of life had reached a new level. First was Master God-Diviner with his family of tens of thousands, and then Bai Xiaochun with his mountain of love letters.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun felt a lot more confident now that the Saint-Emperor had been so flabbergasted by his love letters. But then, just as he was about to go into some more bragging, he sensed three streams of divine sense sweep into the hall\u2026.</p><br/><p>They belonged to none other than Song Junwan, Zhou Zimo and Hou Xiaomei. Upon hearing that the Saint-Emperor had come, they were nervous, and also worried for Bai Xiaochun, but knew that it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to come in person. And thus, they sent some divine sense to check on what was happening.</p><br/><p>If they were in the imperial palace of Saint-Emperor City, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to use divine sense to look in on an archaean. But this was the imperial palace of Arch-Emperor City, and the spell formations set up made it possible for them to do so.</p><br/><p>The first thing that they saw\u2026 was a small mountain of love letters.</p><br/><p>Almost immediately, their streams of divine sense seemed to grow more powerful, lock down onto the love letters, and then suddenly vanish!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face fell, and the Saint-Emperor\u2019s expression flickered.</p><br/><p>Clearing his throat, the Saint-Emperor said, \u201cWhat were you about to say, Second Bro?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>However, there was no way that Bai Xiaochun could be in the mood for continuing the conversation. Chuckling wryly, he scooped up the love letters and then tried to look calm as he changed the subject and continued chatting.</p><br/><p>As for the Saint-Emperor, now that he was sure the little turtle was nowhere nearby, he decided that, considering the sensitive situation in the city, it wouldn\u2019t be good for him to overstay his welcome. Therefore, he took his leave.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun absent-mindedly escorted the Saint-Emperor out, his eyes occasionally flitting guiltily back to the palace.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? They\u2019re just some love letters. It\u2019s not like I asked for them!\u201d Trying to work up some courage, he headed back to his private chamber, where he planned to spend a few days in secluded meditation.</p><br/><p>However, his plan didn\u2019t work\u2026. That very evening, Song Junwan, Zhou Zimo and Hou Xiaomei put aside their differences and joined forces to appear at his private chamber.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was starting to feel even more guilty, especially considering how visibly pregnant Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo were. Although the two of them were smiling broadly, the ill will in their eyes caused him to wail in his heart.</p><br/><p>As for Hou Xiaomei, she had no idea whether or not she was pregnant, but for some reason she kept her hands resting on her belly as she stared at him.</p><br/><p>Song Junwan was the first one to speak. \u201cXiaochun, why did the Saint-Emperor come to visit?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>She spoke in a warm tone, and sounded very mature. If it weren\u2019t for the daggers she was staring, she would have seemed like the picture of womanly virtue.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 well it\u2019s that darn little turtle! He ran away! You know the little turtle, right? You don\u2019t! Well, let me tell you how I met him. You\u2019re actually part of the story, Junwan!\u201d Blinking, Bai Xiaochun prepared to go into detail, but before he could, Zhou Zimo snorted coldly and cut in.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t try to avoid the elephant in the room, Bai Xiaochun. Come on, tell the truth. Are you jealous of Master God-Diviner?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJealous?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said loudly. \u201cAre you kidding me?!\u201d Although he was nearly trembling with anxiety, he put on a look of righteous indignation, and even a bit of confusion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI would never be jealous of him! Actually, he\u2019s the one who\u2019s jealous of me! Although, now that you mention Master God-Diviner, you have to admit that the poor kid really has it rough. Zimo, do you remember those tribes from the Wildlands? Back when I was heading back to the Heavenspan region, you escorted me some of the way, remember? I--\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>As he prepared to continue with his story, Hou Xiaomei planted her fists onto her hips. Fuming like a hot pepper, she said, \u201cBig Bro Xiaochun, you\u2019re the Arch-Emperor now! Although times are peaceful now, you can\u2019t slack off. You need to work hard on your cultivation. You need to focus!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI--\u201d Bai Xiaochun began, but Song Junwan interrupted him.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaomei is absolutely correct. Xiaochun, you have a lot of important responsibilities! Although the three of us can\u2019t do much in that regard, we can at least help you with some of your menial tasks. Come on. Hand over your love letters. We\u2019ll take care of them from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026.\u201d Before he could offer any further explanations, Zhou Zimo, who of course had the worst temper of all of them, stalked over, keeping one arm under her belly as she grabbed his bag of holding. And of course, he didn\u2019t dare to interfere as she\u2026 completely emptied out all of the love letters\u2026.</p><br/><p>His heart was fairly dripping with blood as he looked on, feeling like he was being strangled. It was as if Zhou Zimo wasn\u2019t taking away his love letters, but rather, all the romance that existed in his heart\u2026.</p><br/><p>Looking very pleased with themselves, the three women left with his love letters, leaving him standing there alone in his private chamber, scowling on the verge of tears. As they left, he reached out morosely as it to grab ahold of something, except, there was nothing to lay his hands on.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy love letters!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

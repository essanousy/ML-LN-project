Over the years, he had repeatedly tried to correct his son\u2019s incorrect view of life, but had never succeeded.</p><br/><p>Xiaoxiao was a bit easier to deal with; Dabao was the true headache, and this huge snake was even more evidence of how gutsy he was. And Bai Xiaochun had heard many other stories of things Dabao had done, things that he would never have dared to do at that age\u2026.</p><br/><p>For example, in recent years, ghosts and souls had gradually become more common, possibly because of the rise of the Arch-Emperor Dynasty. And yet Dabao had simply gone out and captured some for himself. He had even captured spies sent over by the Vile-Emperor Dynasty and the Saint-Emperor Dynasty.</p><br/><p>And now he had gone and caught a gigantic snake. It was as if these two children actually loved ghosts, snakes, and the like\u2026.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t seem scared of anything in heaven and earth. And Dabao seemed to jump at the chance to beat up anyone who offended him. On more than one occasion, Bai Xiaochun had actually scanned him with divine sense to make sure he was really his own child\u2026.</p><br/><p>Were it not for the fluctuations within his blood that confirmed he was, Bai Xiaochun would actually have suspected otherwise\u2026.</p><br/><p>The enormous snake that Dabao had captured actually had a high cultivation base, and had developed intelligence many years ago. Because of some certain types of fruits that it had consumed, it also had particularly powerful divine sense. Seeing that the Arch-Emperor seemed to be speaking up for it, it nervously sent out some divine sense to try to beg for mercy.</p><br/><p>However, as soon as it did, Dabao noticed.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey!\u201d he shouted. \u201cHow dare you interrupt the grownups when we're talking. Are you just looking to get a beating!?\u201d Eyes shining with ferocious light, he punched and kicked the snake a handful of times.</p><br/><p>The snake shrieked in terror and humiliation, but couldn\u2019t do a single thing. Bai Xiaochun looked on, sighing.</p><br/><p>\u201cDabao\u2026.\u201d he said, feeling a bit sorry for the snake. Sincerely worried about the inappropriate behavior, he was just trying to think of what to say next, and whether or not he should start to act more strictly, when Xiaoxiao hurried over and pulled Dabao back.</p><br/><p>\u201cDabao, you're supposed to cherish little creatures like that. You can\u2019t hit it!\u201d Xiaoxiao's voice was warm and soft, very pleasant to the ear.</p><br/><p>However, that was what Dabao feared most in his sister. In fact, he often feared her more than his own mother. Therefore, he immediately backed down and stood there obediently.</p><br/><p>Planting her hands on her hips, Xiaoxiao said, \u201cAnd you shouldn't be talking to daddy like that, Dabao. He\u2019s worked very hard to give us a happy and peaceful life. You apologize right this minute!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun saw all of this happening, his heart softened even further, and he felt more than ever that daughters were the best. He thought of how, even as a newborn, she would always laugh when he held her, and it caused warmth to rise up in his heart.</p><br/><p>Even as that warmth appeared, Xiaoxiao continued to loudly scold Dabao.</p><br/><p>\u201cDabao, you know that daddy has never been very brave. He was like that even when he was a kid! He\u2019s scared of dying, and you went and brought in a gigantic snake to scare him!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes went wide as he watched his daughter loudly scolding his son. He even started to get a bit dizzy. Just as he had been contemplating how to provide the proper life education for his children, Xiaoxiao accused Dabao of using the snake to try to scare him\u2026.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was simply stunned.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaoxiao,\u201d he said, \u201cyou--\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, Xiaoxiao turned to look at him, a charming, innocent smile on her face as she said, \u201cDaddy, Grandpa Qinghou told me all about those snakes that scared you so much when you were a kid. It was from that moment on that you feared <em>three</em> things in life: death, ghosts, and snakes! Don\u2019t be scared daddy, I\u2019ll teach Dabao a lesson he won\u2019t forget because of this!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>With that, she turned back to Dabao, who was standing there, head hung low.</p><br/><p>\u201cDabao, this is very, very wrong. You listen to me. If you ever try to scare our daddy again, I\u2019ll beat the crap out of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking quite humiliated, Dabao pouted and quietly said, \u201cI won\u2019t scare daddy ever again, sis.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was now completely bowled over. It was like his daughter could instantly fill blue skies with dark thunderclouds. Off to the side, Lu Yuntao was having a hard time holding back from laughing out loud.</p><br/><p>Wanting to cry, but finding no tears to shed, Bai Xiaochun decided that he really had to establish himself as a figure of fatherly authority. Trying to sound as somber as possible, he said, \u201cXiaoxiao, what you said now was completely incorrect.\u201d Thumping himself on the chest, he continued, \u201cYour daddy--\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>But before he could say anything else, Xiaoxiao smiled sweetly and hugged his leg. Looking up at him, she spoke in a very comforting tone.</p><br/><p>\u201cDaddy, don't be scared. Dabao doesn\u2019t understand these things, but I\u2019ll teach him. Anyway, the two of us already decided a long time ago that before we even grow up, we\u2019ll make sure to catch all of the snakes and ghosts in the Arch-Emperor Dynasty.</p><br/><p>\u201cBy the time we\u2019re grown up, we\u2019ll have them all cleared out. That way, they won\u2019t be able to scare you, daddy. Don\u2019t worry, Dabao and I are here to keep you safe!\u201d Xiaoxiao seemed to be perfectly sincere in everything she was saying, to the point that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart twinged in response.</p><br/><p>As for Dabao, it seemed to take a bit of effort, but he also nodded and said, \u201cDaddy, I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re afraid of snakes and ghosts, but sis is right. From now on, you don\u2019t need to be scared. We two are here to keep you safe! We won't let any snakes or ghosts frighten you!\u201d</p><br/><p>What the two children were saying was actually the truth. Although they often snuck out of the palace because they thought it was fun, the real reason was the stories that Li Qinghou had told them of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s past. After hearing about the things that scared him, they decided that it was their mission to keep him safe.</p><br/><p>To hear the children speaking in such a heartfelt fashion caused Lu Yuntao\u2019s smile to fade away, leaving her eyes glistening with emotion.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was equally moved. Sighing at the realization of what was going on, he decided that now wasn\u2019t the time to try to educate his children. Tousling their hair, he turned to leave. But before he did, he looked over his shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Grandpa Qinghou is actually wrong. The truth is\u2026 your daddy isn\u2019t scared of snakes, or ghosts. He\u2019s actually very brave!\u201d Even as the words left his mouth, he heard the sound of throats being cleared behind him. Turning, he found Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo approaching, enigmatic smiles on their faces as they looked at him. Suddenly feeling embarrassed, he came up with a quick excuse to get away.</p><br/><p>After returning to his private meditation chamber, he sat down and thought back on the conversation. Although he was still moved, he was also worried, and wasn\u2019t sure of what to do about the situation.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess I can't force them to change their personalities. They need to walk their own path, and make their own future. The only thing I can do is try my best to protect them.\u201d He smiled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to have someone trying to keep you safe, especially when it's your own son and daughter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, he closed his eyes and began to perform more auguries regarding twenty-three-colored flame.</p><br/><p>After all the years he had spent doing research and study, he had reached a state of roughly ninety percent enlightenment. Now, he only needed to make some minor adjustments and improvements. He was confident that it wouldn\u2019t be long before he would perfect the formula for twenty-three-colored flame.</p><br/><p>Another year passed, and the formula was finished. He opened his eyes excitedly and waved his right hand, causing a mass of souls to erupt from his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>However, that was when he sensed something very strange from the direction of Gongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s official residence!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat aura\u2026. Something\u2019s wrong!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

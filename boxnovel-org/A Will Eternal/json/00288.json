It was like a convergence of massive weight and power that propelled his cultivation base higher.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds filled him that only he could hear, shaking his mind and heart. It was almost like the Tideflows he had experienced in the Fallen Sword Abyss. Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath, reveling in the feeling of intense power that vastly exceeded anything from before.</p><br/><p>\u201cLate Foundation Establishment!\u201d Bai Xiaochun looked up and started laughing, excitement written across his face. As of this moment, all of his hard work in the Foundation Establishment stage had come to fruition.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on, I, Bai Xiaochun, can easily crush anyone in early Foundation Establishment! If any early Foundation Establishment cultivator dares to provoke me, a slap from me will leave them screaming in pain!\u201d Trembling in excitement, he rose to his feet, and as he did, cracking sounds rang out as a third heavenly demon appeared behind him!!</p><br/><p>Outside in the sky, the clouds swirled rapidly, and thunder crackled. Within the vortex up above, a heavenly demon appeared, and then a second, and a finally, a third!</p><br/><p>Three enormous heavenly demons were right out in the open for everyone to see, and it instantly caused the cultivators of the Spirit Stream Sect who were garrisoned in the area to cry out in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s that!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThose... those look like Dharma Idols!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! What technique is Sect Uncle Bai cultivating!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Similar cries could be heard coming from the Blood Stream Sect. Because of the techniques cultivated by Lesser Marsh Peak, the cultivators from the Blood Stream Sect already had speculations about what they were seeing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat's a Lesser Marsh Peak body refinement technique!! That's the Heavenly Demon Body!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt definitely deserves to be the Blood Lord. Now that he's reached this level in his body refinement, he\u2019ll definitely proceed to the blood fiend level!\u201d</p><br/><p>On the two mountain peaks, the Song Clan patriarch\u2019s eyes shone brightly, and Patriarch Ironwood\u2019s eyes glittered with mysterious light. Both of them were shaken by the heavenly demon incarnations they saw in the sky.</p><br/><p>After a moment passed, the Song Clan patriarch said, \u201cMy boy Nightcrypt\u2019s Heavenly Demon Body is already quite different from Lesser Marsh Peak's....\u201d</p><br/><p>A thoughtful look appeared on Patriarch Ironwood\u2019s face. The two of them exchanged a glance, but didn't say anything else.</p><br/><p>Inside the immortal's cave, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s excited laughter rang out as he felt his fleshly body power rising. He felt more blessed than ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be happening? The medicinal pills that Father and Patriarch Ironwood gave me shouldn\u2019t have pushed my cultivation all the way to this point. Unless....</p><br/><p>\u201cUnless my injuries stimulated some latent power inside of me! Hahaha! That must be it!\u201d Bai Xiaochun almost felt like dancing with joy. In his current state, he really felt incredibly powerful.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, hold on. I can\u2019t be arrogant, and I definitely have to keep working hard. Now that I'm in late Foundation Establishment, I have to crystallize my seventh through ninth spiritual seas, and reach the great circle of Foundation Establishment. Then I can break through to the Gold Core stage!!!\u201d As he thought about the Gold Core stage, he began to pant, and his eyes shone with bright light.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that if you can reach the Gold Core stage, you\u2019ll get at least five hundred additional years of longevity.... Five hundred years...! If I succeed, that means I\u2019ll be able to live for at least a thousand years!!\u201d His hands clenched into fists, and his eyes shone as if with madness. The idea of being able to live for a thousand years filled him with so much excitement that he almost couldn\u2019t control himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI also have the second volume of the Undying Codex. I've finished the steps with the ancient mammoths and the berserk ghosts. Next is the Heavenly Demon Body. Once I make enough heavenly demons, I can proceed to the Asura Body. Once I'm finished with the Asura Body, I can take the second volume of the Undying Codex to the highest level, the Undying Heavenly King Body!!\u201d Slapping his chest confidently, he laughed loudly and prepared to leave his immortal's cave to perform some tests and see exactly how powerful he had become.</p><br/><p>However, after having only taken a few steps toward the door, his face suddenly fell. Considering the level of his cultivation base, he was able to clearly detect that two beams of light were flying in his direction. They were none other than Song Junwan and Hou Xiaomei.</p><br/><p>Obviously, they had sensed Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation base breakthrough, and realized that his session of secluded meditation was over.</p><br/><p>As soon as he thought about the terrifying things that happened when those two women showed up together, his face went pale, and his heart began to tremble. He suddenly slapped his chest, causing his face to turn ashen. He swayed in place a bit, pretending to be weak as he trudged out of his immortal's cave. Song Junwan and Hou Xiaomei approached, and they were clearly preparing to say some sarcastic things, but then they saw his weak demeanor, and their faces fell. Forgetting all about their desire to get into a row, they flew over.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, big bro Xiaochun!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt, what\u2019s wrong? Weren\u2019t things going well just now?\u201d Looking very worried, both women reached out to support Bai Xiaochun by the elbow as they led him back into the immortal's cave to lay down on the stone bed.</p><br/><p>As they comforted him with soft, gentle words, he was reminded of how tender they had been in past times. Now that they weren\u2019t fighting or arguing, he could breathe a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>He coughed a few times and then weakly said, \u201cPerhaps toward the end my qi flow was interrupted. I just need some rest, and then I\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>As the two women waited on him, he lay back and closed his eyes to rest.</p><br/><p>Hou Xiaomei and Song Junwan knew that Bai Xiaochun needed some peace and quiet, so they left silently. After they were gone, Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes and breathed a sigh of relief. Not much remained of the elation he had felt because of his cultivation base breakthrough, and now, his expression was twinged with anxiety.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I do now...?\u201d he thought, scowling at the seemingly unbearable situation.... After a bit of consideration, he decided that the best thing to do was to continue to pretend to feel unwell.</p><br/><p>Time passed. Before long, half a month had gone by. He couldn\u2019t continue to pretend to be weak that entire time, so he gradually started to pretend to look better. As time passed, Song Junwan caught on to the fact that he was pretending to feel unwell. As for Hou Xiaomei, she was a simple girl, but she wasn\u2019t stupid. Even she started to suspect.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun realized that, he was so scared he started shaking. This kind of life was a torture, and by now, he was considering trying to go join the war effort. However, the thought of the deadly dangers of the battlefield caused him to hesitate.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, whatever. I can hang on for a bit longer. Maybe I can think of some other way to deal with this....\u201d Tugging on his hair in frustration, he continued to ponder the situation. Finally, his expression suddenly changed, and he looked very depressed.</p><br/><p>Maintaining that look, he shuffled out of his immortal's cave, whereupon Hou Xiaomei and Song Junwan arrived....</p><br/><p>Gaze soft and voice gentle, Hou Xiaomei said, \u201cBig bro Xiaochun, it\u2019s not good to stay cooped up in your immortal's cave. Let\u2019s go for a walk together, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUm....\u201d he replied hesitatingly.</p><br/><p>Smiling enigmatically, Song Junwan reached out to support Bai Xiaochun\u2019s left arm. \u201cNightcrypt, to cultivators like us, that type of injury is really nothing. Come on, let\u2019s go out into the Luochen Mountains for a bit. If you get your qi and blood moving, it will definitely speed your recovery.\u201d</p><br/><p>In turn, Hou Xiaomei glared and reached out to support his right arm.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun gaped in shock. He didn\u2019t even get a chance to respond to either of them before they were leading him out of the immortal's cave.</p><br/><p>After only a few steps, his feet actually left the ground. He felt like a death row inmate being dragged to his own execution as the two women stared daggers at each other across him. Beads of sweat popped out on his forehead, and he almost felt like crying.</p><br/><p>It was currently dawn, and a faint fog covered most of the Luochen Mountains. As the morning light grew stronger, the fog began to dissipate; it was a very beautiful scene. After being carried out of his immortal's cave, quite a few cultivators from the two sects saw him, and looks of compassion appeared in their eyes as they hurried past the group of three.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun opened his mouth to speak, but then closed it just as quickly. It didn't seem like a good time to talk. If he did, it would definitely lead to more headaches. Therefore, he gritted his teeth and decided that going for a bit of a walk wouldn\u2019t be so bad.</p><br/><p>Even as such thoughts passed through his head, a bird flew by overhead. It was bright red, and quite beautiful, and as it flew along, it let out a melodious cry.</p><br/><p>Song Junwan saw the bird, and looked surprised. \u201cLook, Nightcrypt! A bloodspirit heron! I never thought I would see one of the Blood Stream Sect\u2019s bloodspirit herons here. I used to love watching them flying around back on Middle Peak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as Bai Xiaochun looked up at the bird, Hou Xiaomei bristled with a killing aura and loudly said, \u201cBloodspirit heron? What are you talking about? That\u2019s obviously an irispetal ibis from the Spirit Stream Sect!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Junwan looked over angrily at Hou Xiaomei, who, unwilling to be outdone, stuck her chest out and glared back defiantly.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was stuck between them, sweating profusely. Things were reaching a point where he almost couldn't deal with the headache. That was when Song Junwan laughed charmingly, and looked at Bai Xiaochun with sparkling, mesmerizing eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt, what do you think? Is that bird a bloodspirit heron or an irispetal ibis?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not willing to be outdone, Hou Xiaomei grabbed Bai Xiaochun\u2019s arm. Looking completely heartbroken, she softly asked, \u201cBig bro Xiaochun, tell that old auntie that it\u2019s an irispetal ibis.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

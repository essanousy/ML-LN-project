However, because of the chaos which had played out recently, the Wildlanders had been driven into a fury. At the same time, the savage tribes didn\u2019t dare to show their faces.</p><br/><p>Few savage giants could be seen on the battlefield, and those that were visible kept their distance from the wall. There were few beasts either. However, the tide of vengeful souls continued to smash into the wall and the shield. Although this form of attack wasn\u2019t particularly effective, the sheer numbers involved ensured that the shield continue to ripple and emit light.</p><br/><p>Clearly, the vengeful souls had no hope of breaking through the defenses of the Great Wall. The magical cannons were firing constantly, and the cultivators of the five legions attacked with surgical precision. As a result, most of the souls which got close were destroyed.</p><br/><p>A battle like this had not taken place from the moment the Great Wall came into existence until this moment. By this point, it was impossible to determine exactly how many vengeful souls had been destroyed. And yet, there were always more souls to replace them.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, because the Underworld River had been tampered with, the number of souls only seemed to increase.</p><br/><p>It was in that moment that Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and strode out to the edge of the wall, his eyes shining with anticipation. When he threw out the golden Soul Convergence Pill, it turned into a streak of golden light that flew out into the very middle of the soul tide.</p><br/><p>When it thumped onto the ground, it didn\u2019t break apart like the previous version of the pill had. Instead, it emitted gold, rippling light in all directions.</p><br/><p>Instantly, both the cultivators on the wall and the Wildlands savages could see that the golden ripples extended to fill a 3,000-meter area!</p><br/><p>Within that 3,000-meter area, all of the vengeful souls trembled, and before they could do anything, a whooshing sound filled the air as all of the souls were sucked together into one spot.</p><br/><p>The Soul Convergence Pill became like a black hole, and in the blink of an eye, countless screams could be heard as all of the more than 10,000 souls in the area of the pill became streaks of light that were absorbed into the pill itself.</p><br/><p>However, that wasn\u2019t anything very impressive, and Bai Lin even frowned in response. The power of this Soul Convergence Pill didn\u2019t seem to measure up to the exploding pill furnaces.</p><br/><p>However, before he could put too much thought into the matter, the golden Soul Convergence Pill which had sucked in all the souls in the 3,000-meter area suddenly change color. In the briefest of moments, it turned bright red!</p><br/><p>In that instant, an incredible rumbling sound echoed out as the second deadly effect of the Soul Convergence Pill was unleashed. The pill exploded in wild fashion, sending red ripples out to cover a 30,000-meter area!!</p><br/><p>As that happened, the vengeful souls that were covered by the red ripples began to shake violently, as if they were struggling against something. Then, the brutality in their eyes vanished, and their bodies vanished as quickly as a strand of smoke in a storm wind! Furthermore, in the moment of vanishing, their eyes suddenly seemed to be looking around and seeing everything clearly!</p><br/><p>Within that clarity, there seemed to be a look of relief....</p><br/><p>The battlefield once again went silent. The savage giants began to tremble as they looked over at the terrifying medicinal pill that was clearly as powerful as ten exploding furnaces. Without even thinking about it, they began to edge away.</p><br/><p>Back on the Great Wall, everyone, Bai Lin included, gasped in the realization that this new pill was clearly as effective as ten or more exploding furnaces.</p><br/><p>And that was just one medicinal pill!!</p><br/><p>Bai Lin looked over excitedly at Bai Xiaochun and asked, \u201cGrandmaster Bai, are you the only one who can use this pill, or can it be used by others, too?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Bai Xiaochun concocts pills, of course they\u2019re the type that anyone can use!\u201d Even Bai Xiaochun had been a bit shocked by what had happened outside the wall. That was especially the case because of how the vengeful souls had looked relieved right before vanishing. That left Bai Xiaochun feeling very strange.</p><br/><p>Even he had been unaware that there would be another incredible use to the pills. Apparently, they could purify the souls they affected.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, something else happened that no one else noticed. A blurry figure had appeared high up the sky, who was now looking down at the ground below. It was an old man, and although it was difficult to make out his facial features, if Bai Xiaochun had been close by, he would have recognized him immediately. He was none other than the gravekeeper!!</p><br/><p>Surrounding him were what appeared to be illusory, rippling fluid, which was none other than Underworld River water.</p><br/><p>He looked deeply at Bai Xiaochun, then turned away and vanished into the Underworld River water.</p><br/><p>Down on the Great Wall, Bai Lin\u2019s eyes shone as brightly as the sun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWonderful. Can you mass-produce them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun blinked a few times, then looked out at the battlefield and waved his hand dismissively. \u201cOf course I can. However, as you can probably tell, I don\u2019t have enough medicinal plants or pill furnaces.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Delighted, Bai Lin threw his head back and laughed uproariously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s no problem at all. Would a thousand pill furnaces be enough?! As for the medicinal plants, I can take you to see the liaison from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect. As long as your demands aren\u2019t too excessive, he should be able to accommodate you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun realized that Bai Lin was reminding him not to get too greedy. Chuckling, he replied, \u201cOf course....\u201d while simultaneously trying to decide what medicinal plants he would ask for.</p><br/><p>Bai Lin took a deep breath to keep his excitement under control as he thought about what it would be like for all the soldiers in the Skin Flayers to have a Soul Convergence Pill ready to throw out at any time. It could completely change the entire course of the war!</p><br/><p>In fact, he could even see himself as being the first general from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect to actually lead a devastating campaign into the Wildlands!</p><br/><p>The meritorious services he would perform, and the glory he would accumulate, would be talked about throughout the ages. Having reached this point in his train of thought, Bai Lin couldn\u2019t prevent his heart from racing as he looked from the battlefield back to Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaochun, according to the deva patriarch, this Wildlands offensive is different from anything in the past. Although it might seem like they\u2019re on the run right now, the truth is that within the next few months, they will lead a charge greater than anything so far!</p><br/><p>\u201cDuring that battle, it is highly likely that one of their almighty Deva Realm experts will join the fight. Of course, Senior Chen will handle that part of the fighting, and we wouldn't be able to do much to help. But in terms of the rest of the battle, it will be huge, and we will see an unimaginable number of savages and souls.</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, not only must you hurry and concoct as many Soul Convergence Pill as possible, you should also try to come up with a way to produce a type of exploding furnace whose detonation surpasses anything you did before by multiple times. The bigger the explosion, the better!!\u201d</p><br/><p>In response to Bai Lin\u2019s words, Bai Xiaochun stood there thoughtfully. The truth was that he didn\u2019t particularly want to concoct medicinal pills with the express purpose of getting the furnace to explode. After all, he was an apothecary, and apothecaries were supposed to concoct medicine, not explode furnaces. His exploding furnaces had only resulted from an unexpected turn of events during the concocting process.</p><br/><p>Back when he had first arrived in Great Wall City, he would have been too nervous to refuse, but right now, he felt a bit daring, and also determined. He was a grandmaster, right?! Therefore, he glared back at Bai Lin and shook his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cGeneral Bai, I\u2019m afraid you can just forget about--\u201d However, before he could finish speaking, Bai Lin\u2019s expression flickered, and at the same time, both of them heard numerous cries of alarm rising up.</p><br/><p>Some distance away from the Great Wall, more than a hundred beams of light could be seen screaming through the air at incredible speed, clearly ignoring any threat to themselves. As they closed in, it was possible to see that there were over a hundred giants, each one of them at least 60 meters tall. From their size, and from the incredible fluctuations rolling off of them, it was obvious that these were powerful experts from whatever tribe they came from.</p><br/><p>The cultivators on the wall instantly focused on the incoming giants. Soon, the giants began to self-detonate, causing incredible booms to ring out. However, even as that drew the attention of more cultivators on the wall, three beams of light appeared from a different direction, like three arrows ripping through the air, borrowing the force of the self-detonating giants to reach the Great Wall itself.</p><br/><p>Soon, it was clear that within these three beams of light were not giants, but rather, soul cultivators!!</p><br/><p>There were two men and one woman, and as soon as they appeared, they unleashed a bizarre divine ability that caused a demonic green light to form together into a huge hand. In response, Bai Lin\u2019s eyes glittered, and he waved his right hand, sending out a powerful surge of energy toward the three soul cultivators. In that same moment, Bai Xiaochun looked over.</p><br/><p>He was separated from the three soul cultivators by the shield, and yet, they were staring directly at him with venomous hatred. Before Bai Lin\u2019s divine ability could get close to them, all three self-detonated!</p><br/><p>There had to be a good reason for two waves of attackers to all self-detonate!!</p><br/><p>Heart pounding, Bai Xiaochun slowly began to back up.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

However, only a moment later, the light faded, and his divine sense began to dissolve.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan\u2019t quite get the Go board\u2026.\u201d he thought, sighing regretfully. Pulling his divine sense back, he sat down cross-legged and performed some breathing exercises until he was fully recovered. Then he stood up and sent his divine sense out again. Instead of targeting the Go board, though, he locked onto the Go piece. As it began to vibrate and emit bright light, he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and then waved his finger through the air!</p><br/><p>The Go piece became a bright streak of light that shot out of the fan face and into the void. The energy on display far surpassed that of a celestial, and was more like that of an archaean expert. The fan itself trembled, and the startled Bai Xiaochun waved his finger in the direction of the sovereign\u2019s arm!</p><br/><p>When the light hit the arm, a spectacular boom echoed out, and the arm was shoved backward several meters. At the same time, a hole appeared in it, the same size as the Go piece!!</p><br/><p>It only dug about three inches into the surface of the arm, but it caused the flesh to begin to decay for a moment before the fan\u2019s powers of regeneration kicked in and healed the wound. Even still, Bai Xiaochun was shocked by the ferocity of the attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo\u2026 so strong!!\u201d He was excited, but at the same time, didn\u2019t want to injure the arm any further, and therefore didn\u2019t dare to use it to do any more tests. Next, he used his authority over the fan to cause it to stop moving, and then he flew off of it into the void!!</p><br/><p>There, he performed an incantation gesture, calling upon his connection to the fan to send a bright stream of light shooting out from it. The light pierced through the void until it reached a certain spot, where it exploded.</p><br/><p>Vibrations rolled out through the void, invisible, but detectable by Bai Xiaochun. Considering that he was now in the late Celestial Realm, and had already fought with an archaean once, he could tell exactly what those fluctuations indicated</p><br/><p>\u201cAn archaean-level attack! It even seemed stronger than when the Vile-Emperor attacked me!!</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how long it would take for the light from that Go piece to reach the Eternal Immortal Domains if I summoned it\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I wonder how many times I could do it?!\u201d After some more thought, he went further out into the void to do some tests and see how quickly the light could reach him.</p><br/><p>What he found was that as soon as he summoned it, it would appear in front of him, almost as if it were completely ignoring the space between the two of them!!</p><br/><p>Eyes widening, he changed locations and did a few more tests. Afterward, he was convinced that it didn\u2019t matter where he was, the light would come to him immediately!</p><br/><p>\u201cNow this is what I call a weapon!!\u201d he said, throwing his head back and laughing uproariously. He continued to perform more tests. After fifteen, it reached the point where no light came.</p><br/><p>At that point, he realized that fifteen times in a row was the limit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder if that means I can use it fifteen times every day!?\u201d Fifteen times per day would be more than enough. Savoring this development, he returned to the fan, sending it along its way through the void as he sat down cross-legged to meditate.</p><br/><p>The next day, he excitedly performed some more tests. However, it was to his shock that he got no response from the Go piece.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, he started to get a bit nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way\u2026. Don\u2019t tell me that you can only use it fifteen times total\u2026?\u201d The thought instantly caused him to want to moan in grief.</p><br/><p>Starting to obsess at the thought of what he might have lost out on, he waited for more time to pass. For an entire month, all of his tests met with failure\u2026. By now, he was feeling profound regret for what he had done.</p><br/><p>The thought of having wasted fifteen archaean-level attacks made him wish he could smack himself silly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did I have to go and waste them?!\u201d he said, frowning and sighing in defiance. An entire year passed. Finally, he decided to perform another test, whereupon bright light suddenly began to shine from the Go piece. Apparently, after using all of the light, it would take a full year to recharge. Shooting to his feet, he began to laugh loudly.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom now on I'm going to call the light from that Go piece\u2026 Archaean Luminescence!\u201d Swishing his sleeve, he reveled in the sensation of having another trump card at his disposal.</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce Wan'er and Zimo are awake, I\u2019ll go back to the Eternal Immortal Domains!\u201d High-spirited and full of mettle, he looked back at the tower. Based on his calculations, there was only a year to go before Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo awoke!</p><br/><p>Bruiser would likely awaken along with them. Sadly, there didn\u2019t seem to be any change in Song Que.</p><br/><p>It was at around this time that Bai Xiaochi woke up.</p><br/><p>Clearly, his divine sense was much stronger than before. After scanning the fan with it, he proudly materialized in front of Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey there, little Xiaochun. I have some issues with you being the new owner of this fan, and would like--\u201d Before he could say anything further, Bai Xiaochun looked at him out of the corner of his eye and then unleashed a beam of Archaean Luminescence on him.</p><br/><p>The light instantly struck fear into the heart of Bai Xiaochi, who shivered and dodged to the side. When he looked back at Bai Xiaochun, all sense of arrogance was gone from him, and he looked like the picture of subservience.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked coolly, standing there with his hands clasped behind his back.</p><br/><p>Heart pounding with fear, Bai Xiaochi said, \u201cI just said\u2026 that I\u2026 think you\u2019re the most suitable person in all creation to own this legacy fan, milord!!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Never could he have imagined that, while he slept, Bai Xiaochun would gain control over the Go piece all on his own!</p><br/><p>\u201cI have an idea,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, looking back at him. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about that name change you wanted. I\u2019ve come up with the perfect name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochi immediately began to wail inwardly with grief. Terrified of what name the vengeful Bai Xiaochun would give him, he quickly said, \u201cMilord, after absorbing that large spirit automaton, many more powers have been awakened within me. Although I can't yet get those archaean slaves from the boat to leave the fan, I can summon them to you to be sparring partners. That way, you can get used to fighting with archaeans. And then, when you get back to the Eternal Immortal Domains, you\u2019ll definitely dominate anyone who tries to fight you!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Worried that Bai Xiaochun might not believe him, or might not give him a chance to follow through on his offer, he performed an incantation gesture and threw all of the divine sense he could muster toward the fan face.</p><br/><p>Instantly, one of the two archaean slaves shivered, and his eyes began to glow. Rising to his feet, he blurred into motion, flying up into the air within the world of the fan face.</p><br/><p>Clasping hands, he bowed deeply in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, master!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Bai Xiaochun had hoped to take the archaean slaves with him, and was disappointed that he couldn\u2019t, it would also be good to do some training with them. When Bai Xiaochi saw how his eyes were shining brightly, he breathed a sigh of relief in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cMilord,\u201d he continued obsequiously, \u201cthe exalted sovereign captured these archaean slaves and sealed them with restrictive spells. Only a sovereign could possibly undo them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring Bai Xiaochi, Bai Xiaochun entered the world of the fan face.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s fight!\u201d Even as the words left his mouth, he attacked.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

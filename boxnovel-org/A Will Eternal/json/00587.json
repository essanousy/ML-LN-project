Quite a few clan members were following along behind him, extremely curious to see what would happen next.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s going toward the flame conjuring trial!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s already taken 1st place in the Foundation Establishment trials for spirit enhancement and soul medicine. If he does the same with flame conjuring, then Bai Hao... will definitely rise to prominence with incredible speed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething seems strange about all this, though. Bai Hao always had a low position, and seemed cowardly and weak. Why is he suddenly showing off like this? Furthermore, it\u2019s hard to believe he has such heaven-defying talent in spirit enhancement!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the discussions raged, Bai Xiaochun hurried along to the trial for flame conjuring. Upon arriving, he found a stone stele that was clearly much larger than the other stone steles in the other locations.</p><br/><p>Three concentric rings of conjuring stations could be seen at the bottom of the stone stele. Furthermore, quite a crowd was present, including many servants. Obviously, people had already heard about Bai Hao\u2019s performances earlier, and had come to watch.</p><br/><p>As soon as he appeared, more conversations rose up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s here! Bai Hao is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn one day, he\u2019s already taken 1st place in the trials for spirit enhancement and soul medicine. I'm going to bet that he\u2019ll also acquire a shocking rank in the flame conjuring rankings!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNice job, Bai Hao.... Nobody ever noticed you before, but that was because you were keeping your true potential hidden!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun strode forward through the crowd, which parted to make way for him. Inside, he was sighing repeatedly.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Hao, my apprentice, all of this praise belongs to you. With your talent in flame concocting, I'm sure you would do even better than me.\u201d The more Bai Xiaochun thought about how tragically Bai Hao had died, the more he felt like it was a huge pity.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Bai Clan owes you, and as your Master, I\u2019m going to make sure you get what's yours!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition to flushing out your killer, I have another goal. I want to see the reaction of both your father and the clan as a whole when you prove how talented you are!\u201d Eyes sparkling, he headed toward one of the conjuring workstations and then closed himself inside. Outside, the audience looked on in anticipation.</p><br/><p>The matter had even drawn the attention of some of the clan elders, many of whom left their mansions to come see what was going on for themselves.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, the entire Bai Clan was being shaken by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s shocking performance.</p><br/><p>Not too long after he entered the conjuring workstation, eight beams of light appeared off in the distance, in the lead position of which was an eye-catching young man in the great circle of Core Formation.</p><br/><p>The group which accompanied him were all chosen of the Bai Clan who followed him blindly wherever he went. The arrival of the group caused another commotion in the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Qi!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cA chosen from the direct bloodline, officially proclaimed as the qilin son of the Bai Clan... Bai Qi!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting. He and Bai Hao actually have the same father, but different mothers.\u201d The clan members and servants in the area looked on with glittering eyes, and many of them made way for the new arrivals. Some of the clan members gazed upon Bai Qi with zealous passion; to them, he was the number one chosen of his generation, the crown prince of the clan!</p><br/><p>Such clan members stepped forward and offered formal greetings. However, there were others in the crowd who gave little more than hostile snorts.</p><br/><p>Those people were from other, auxiliary bloodlines. It was only natural for there to be tension between different bloodlines in a clan, especially when it came to competition between the chosen members.</p><br/><p>Bai Qi nodded in response to the clan members who were offering formal greetings, then glanced around at the hundreds of people and said, \u201cQuite a little crowd we have here. I heard something\u2019s going on. What could it be?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Despite the broad smile on his face, he was actually feeling very displeased.</p><br/><p>Among the clan members who clearly revered Bai Qi was a young man who stepped forward and respectfully said, \u201cCrown Prince, everybody\u2019s here because Bai Hao took 1st place in the other two trials by fire. Now that he\u2019s come to the trial for flame conjuring, we're all here to see what happens.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh? Bai Hao, huh? Seems my worthless little brother has attracted quite a bit of attention. Alright, well as his older brother I guess I might as well wait around to congratulate him.\u201d As soon as these words left his mouth, profound gleams could be seen in the eyes of many others in the area.</p><br/><p>Obviously, everyone was well aware of the relationship between Bai Qi and Bai Hao</p><br/><p>It was in that moment that Bai Hao\u2019s name suddenly lit up on the stone stele, in 1st place, with the words <em>seven-colored flame</em> next to it!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had been careful to limit his success to seven-colored flame; after all, Bai Hao was supposed to be a Foundation Establishment cultivator, and although he was trying to make a scene, he didn\u2019t want to make things too unrealistic, otherwise it could lead to trouble.</p><br/><p>Seven-colored flame was where he chose to limit things, the standard for master necromancers. Master necromancers were rare among Foundation Establishment cultivators, and would cause a stir wherever they appeared, even in Giant Ghost City.</p><br/><p>\u201cSeven-colored flame!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Bai Hao... he\u2019s... he\u2019s actually a master necromancer!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens, how is that possible? Even a lot of the clan elders in the Core Formation stage aren\u2019t master necromancers....\u201d</p><br/><p>People in the crowd were starting to go crazy, both direct bloodline descendants and people from the auxiliary bloodlines. As for the clan elders who had come to observe, they were visibly moved.</p><br/><p>Bai Qi\u2019s face was expressionless, and yet, inside, he was feeling extremely displeased. It was even possible to see a grim glint in his eyes.</p><br/><p>As the crowd clamored, Bai Xiaochun emerged from the conjuring workstation, and was very pleased by what he heard. As of this point, he was fairly certain that he had achieved his goal of establishing a high profile. Now that he had taken 1st place in all of the trials by fire, it was highly likely that whoever was responsible for Bai Hao\u2019s death would accelerate their plans. Furthermore, he would soon see what the clan chief felt about the whole thing.</p><br/><p>In almost the exact same instant that he stepped out into the open, numerous gazes fell upon him. There were gazes of jealousy, confusion, shock, and various other emotions.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Qi, his eyes were cold and filled with disgust.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun quickly noticed Bai Qi, and although it was his first time seeing Bai Hao\u2019s older brother, based on his cultivation base and expression, it was easy to identify him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo that\u2019s Bai Qi, huh...?\u201d he thought, standing there staring at him with narrowed eyes.</p><br/><p>Everyone could see what was happening, and soon, the crowd quieted down. Many of the people from the auxiliary bloodlines looked over, curious about what exactly would happen between the two brothers.</p><br/><p>Bai Qi looked over and coolly said, \u201cFeeling proud of yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>His cultivation base was in the great circle of Core Formation, which caused significant pressure to weigh down on the crowd as his voice echoed out with thunderous might. Quite a few people even backed up a bit.</p><br/><p>\u201cTaking 1st place in all three trials is quite an accomplishment,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019ll give you that.\u201d Although Bai Qi appeared to be offering words of congratulation, the coldness in his tone didn\u2019t seem congratulatory at all.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes sparkled as he continued to stare at Bai Qi and wait for him to make his point. Whatever he said would reveal the true nature of his relationship with Bai Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d Bai Qi continued in a cool tone, \u201cyou pushed things a bit too far, Bai Hao. Nobody else here knows you very well, but as your older brother, I do. How could you possibly accomplish something like this on your own? Clearly, you used some underhanded method to cheat! How very disappointing of you.\u201d With that, Bai Qi extended his right hand to reveal a command medallion, which he waved at the stone stele.</p><br/><p>Instantly, Bai Hao\u2019s name on the ranking list faded away and disappeared. Shockingly, Bai Qi had used his status as crown prince to simply remove Bai Hao\u2019s name!</p><br/><p>At first, everyone in the area was shocked, but then, they broke out into a hubbub.</p><br/><p>\u201cCheating?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSee, I told you so! Bai Hao was always weak and cowardly. How could he suddenly rise to prominence like that? As it turns out, he was cheating....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cInteresting. Well, nobody will ever be able to say for sure whether he was <em>actually\u00a0</em>cheating or not....\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Bai Qi was looking coldly at Bai Xiaochun, doing nothing to conceal the disdain and contempt in his eyes.</p><br/><p>It was almost as if he were using his gaze to tell Bai Xiaochun that no matter what he did, he could reduce him to nothing with the single slap of a palm!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

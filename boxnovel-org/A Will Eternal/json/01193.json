On the main square, the spirit automaton Bai Xiaochi stood there, looking helplessly at two women and a corpse.</p><br/><p>The women were beautiful, and despite being extremely weak, were definitely alive. Unfortunately, despite the vast stores of knowledge which existed in Bai Xiaochi\u2019s mind, he had no idea why their bellies were so large.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here?!?!\u201d he grumbled. \u201cWhy did that shameless bastard send a corpse up here\u2026?\u201d Bai Xiaochi was not very happy about what was happening. Unsure of what these two women had to do with Bai Xiaochun, all he could do was squat off to the side, sighing and staring.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun hadn\u2019t been gone for very long, to the point where Bai Xiaochi hadn\u2019t even had a chance to sleep. He couldn\u2019t stop thinking about having a new master. After all of the years of freedom he had experienced, it was somewhat of a depressing thought, and was a constant source of sighing.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, his expression flickered, and the depressed frown vanished from his face, to be replaced by a wide smile. Looking very ingratiating, he bowed at the waist in a certain direction some distance away on the main square.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was materializing in that very direction. Before the process was finished, Bai Xiaochun shouted out in an anxious voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cActivate the defensive formation, little automaton! We're under attack!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochi shivered as, right behind Bai Xiaochun, another figure began to take shape. At the same time, an archaean aura erupted out, an aura filled with greed and excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cAt long last\u2026 I'm back! This sovereign fan is now mine!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shrieking, Bai Xiaochi waved his sleeve to collect up the two women and the corpse. Backing up, he performed an incantation gesture, causing the entire damaged fan to tremble and emit bright light. At the same time, the image on the face of the fan erupted with powerful fluctuations that shot toward the Vile-Emperor.</p><br/><p>A whole string of defensive countermeasures were unleashed at the same time. Simultaneously, Bai Xiaochun leaped to join Bai Xiaochi, drawing upon all the powers he had at his disposal to suppress the Vile-Emperor.</p><br/><p>The Vile-Emperor was now about half-materialized. His facial features were visible, and his divine sense was already spreading out into the fan. However, as soon as the fluctuations of the defensive countermeasures hit his divine sense, it dissipated. Furthermore, as the Vile-Emperor continued to materialize, he suddenly found a force of expulsion pushing at him!</p><br/><p>It was clearly a shock to the Vile-Emperor. Despite having come prepared, he could never have guessed that the fan\u2019s spirit automaton would heed Bai Xiaochun\u2019s orders.</p><br/><p>The implications were obvious\u2026 and caused a look of incredulity to appear on the Vile-Emperor\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou actually took control of the damaged fan? Impossible! It\u2019s too difficult to bond with this treasure! A celestial simply couldn\u2019t do it. Not only would you have to pass all one hundred levels, but you would have to deal with resistance from the spirit automaton as well. It's just too hard!!\u201d Despite the Vile-Emperor\u2019s disbelief, the fluctuations of expulsion only continued to grow stronger. Letting out a growled shout, he performed a double-handed incantation gesture, causing black flames to shoot forth!</p><br/><p>Along with the flames came a burst of archaean power, which managed to resist the force of expulsion to some degree.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, dammit, DAMMIT!!\u201d Bai Xiaochi blurted.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Off to the side, Bai Xiaochun was getting very nervous. \u201cGet him out of here, otherwise we\u2019re finished!! Come on, you\u2019re the spirit automaton, right? This is a sovereign treasure! Is it really that hard to get an archaean out of here?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring matters of propriety, Bai Xiaochi angrily shouted, \u201cShut the hell up! This is a <em>living</em> archaean we\u2019re talking about!! If he was outside the fan it would be one thing. But he\u2019s already halfway inside! Fudge, I'm doing everything I can!!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t have time to get angry about Bai Xiaochi\u2019s tone of voice. Wracked with anxiety, he yelled, \u201cLet\u2019s join forces! Use that sovereign arm we got! We have to get this bastard out of here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochi was a bit hesitant to agree, but also knew that failure was not an option. Grinding his teeth, he joined forces with Bai Xiaochun, causing the wolfish arm that now existed in the face of the fan to slowly stretch out!</p><br/><p>As that happened, the Vile-Emperor gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe arm of a sovereign!!\u201d he said, shocked. Originally, he had assumed that once he got to the sovereign's fan, he could easily take control of it. Unfortunately, Bai Xiaochun had already become the new owner, and had turned the entire situation upside down.</p><br/><p>The Vile-Emperor was not yet willing to just leave. All of a sudden, his eyes turned pitch black, and a bizarre aura swept out from inside of him. As the aura merged with his archaean cultivation base, he suddenly started growing stronger and stronger.</p><br/><p>Black flames raged around him, shoving away the fluctuations of expulsion. As that happened, he began to grow clearer and clearer, and even took a step forward onto the main square. Obviously, he was only moments away from fully materializing.</p><br/><p>Both Bai Xiaochun and Bai Xiaochi were going crazy with anxiety. Bai Xiaochun spat out some blood to gain more power, and Bai Xiaochi pushed his divine sense to the point of inflicting harm on himself. Together, they forced the sovereign\u2019s arm to move even faster toward the Vile-Emperor. Before the Vile-Emperor could fully materialize, the arm slammed into him, accompanied by deafening rumbling sounds.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet back to where you came from!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun shouted.</p><br/><p>The enormous sovereign arm seemed powerful enough to destroy the heavens and crush the earth. As it bore down on the Vile-Emperor, he began to tremble, and yet, his eyes grew even blacker, causing more flames to erupt around him. Soon, they formed together into an enormous flame giant, hundreds of meters tall, that howled as it prepared to fight the incoming sovereign arm.</p><br/><p>The flame giant shuddered as the sovereign arm slammed into it. A moment later, it collapsed, revealing the Vile-Emperor. Strangely, because of the bizarre aura that swirled around him, the sovereign arm suddenly lurched to a halt for a brief moment.</p><br/><p>Seizing that moment of advantage, the Vile-Emperor roared, forcing himself to fully materialize. As that happened, Bai Xiaochun unleashed all of the cultivation base power he could, as well as his divine sense, forcing the sovereign\u2019s arm to continue its attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to go for broke!!\u201d Bai Xiaochi shouted. Blurring into motion, he shot forward to merge into the sovereign arm. A moment later, the arm began to emanate the aura of a sovereign!</p><br/><p>The Vile-Emperor\u2019s face fell as the black flames around him began to flicker wildly, as though they might be extinguished at any moment. Although he had fully materialized, the arm was locked onto him, making it impossible for him to flee the incoming attack. Howling, he shot forward to meet it.</p><br/><p>The resulting boom caused the entire fan to shake wildly.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can't stay away forever, Bai Xiaochun!!\u201d the Vile-Emperor shouted. He was already returning to where he came from, not of his own accord, but because of the attack from the sovereign\u2019s arm, and the sovereign aura which came with it. To the Vile-Emperor, it was supremely frustrating, like having a door opened up right in front of him, but being unable to enter it.</p><br/><p>As the Vile-Emperor vanished, Bai Xiaochi flew head first out from inside the sovereign's arm, his face pale. Before he even landed onto the main square, he was unconscious.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiaochun, he coughed up some blood, and then sat down cross-legged to focus on recovery.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

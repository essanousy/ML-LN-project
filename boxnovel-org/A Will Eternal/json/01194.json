The damaged fan continued to sail through the soundless darkness.</p><br/><p>It was a state of seemingly ultimate peacefulness\u2026.</p><br/><p>Only the light of the damaged fan could be seen, twinkling in the darkness like a star or planet.</p><br/><p>However, with the fan\u2019s spirit automaton asleep, and Bai Xiaochun meditating to recover, the glimmering light was not as bright as before. One day, Bai Xiaochi\u2019s eyes opened. He looked very tired as he crawled to his feet and looked around blankly. Back when he had passed out, Bai Xiaochun had only been able to lapse into virtual unconsciousness as he meditated. As a result, the enormous sovereign\u2019s arm had fallen down onto the surface of the fan, instead of going back into the fan face.</p><br/><p>Despite not being under anyone\u2019s direct control, the arm was still immensely powerful, and had damaged many of the fan ribs. The fan now looked in worse state than ever\u2026.</p><br/><p>The sight caused Bai Xiaochi to tremble in grief.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy home\u2026.\u201d he wailed. Within the profound silence, the sound of his wail was particularly ear-piercing, and caused Bai Xiaochun to shiver. Then, his eyes opened, and he leapt to his feet, performing an incantation gesture as he looked around.</p><br/><p>When he saw that they were no longer under attack, he breathed a sigh of relief. Then, he hurried over to Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo, who were still unconscious. Off to the side, Song Que\u2019s corpse lay still and unmoving. Because of the strange properties of the fan, his corpse had not yet begun to decompose.</p><br/><p>He was surrounded by soft, swirling light, power from the fan itself that Bai Xiaochi had placed over him to protect his body.</p><br/><p>Although Bai Xiaochun was relieved to see his corpse in good condition, bitterness filled his heart. Off to the side, Bai Xiaochi was still wailing miserably.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Annoyed, Bai Xiaochun snapped, \u201cWhat's with the damn squawking?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d Bai Xiaochi shouted back emotionally. \u201cThis is all your fault! My home!\u201d</p><br/><p>Stunned, Bai Xiaochun looked around. Moments before, he had been too worried about Song Junwan, Zhou Zimo, and Song Que to take a close look at the fan. Now that he looked around, and saw how the sovereign\u2019s arm had smashed into the fan, he rubbed his nose guiltily.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but feel bad, especially considering that it had only been with Bai Xiaochi\u2019s help that he repelled the Vile-Emperor. Now, seeing Bai Xiaochi looking so sad, Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but try to comfort him. \u201cWell\u2026 you can\u2019t blame me. Ah, whatever. I\u2019ll help you fix it back up\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochi blinked a few times in surprise. The truth was that he had immediately regretted his outburst, and was even scared about how Bai Xiaochun might react. Therefore, the words of comfort caught him off guard. He was also a bit excited. However, he knew that he shouldn\u2019t push things too far. Snorting, he joined Bai Xiaochun to put the sovereign\u2019s arm back into the fan face, and then start working to repair the broken fan ribs.</p><br/><p>They couldn\u2019t repair them perfectly, but did a fair job. After all, the fan was a starry sky treasure, and was also capable of repairing itself to a certain level. At a certain point, such powers of repair took over.</p><br/><p>Afterward, Bai Xiaochun spent more time recovering. Finally, he headed over to Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo. The sight of them sitting there with their swollen bellies, and with the Bruiser totem tattoo on Song Junwan\u2019s arm, caused a warm look to appear in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Feeling very pleased with himself, Bai Xiaochi looked at Bai Xiaochun, then looked at the two women.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t even look back at him as he quietly replied, \u201cThey\u2019re my Daoist partners. And inside of them\u2026 are my children.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochi pondered why someone\u2019s Daoist partners would have children in their bellies. It actually sounded somewhat frightening. After some thought, he realized he had another question.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the corpse\u2026?\u201d he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was a dear friend\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied, closing his eyes to prevent the grief from showing.</p><br/><p>Deciding that this was a good chance to get some concessions, Bai Xiaochi replied, \u201cUm\u2026 hey, Bai Xiaochun, you know, I have a way to make sure that your Daoist partners and children get healthier than before. And there\u2019s also a chance I could resurrect your friend\u2026. Do you think you could maybe change my name back to--\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you just say?!?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun interrupted, vanishing and reappearing right in front of Bai Xiaochi, his eyes shining with madness and excitement.</p><br/><p>The damaged fan seemed to respond to his emotions, and began to shine more brightly than before. At the same time, rumbling sounds echoed out as the repair work being done to the fan ribs began to speed up.</p><br/><p>Although Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo seemed to be in normal condition, just sleeping, Bai Xiaochun was fairly certain that they had sustained severe injuries to their vital energy. It was only because of the protection provided by Bruiser, and the powerful lives brewing in their bellies, that they had survived their ordeal.</p><br/><p>In any case, the injuries they had sustained were the type that Bai Xiaochun would only be able to heal once he was back in completely top shape. Only then could they regain consciousness.</p><br/><p>It was the same with Bruiser. As for Song Que, he was dead, with his soul dispersed, nothing more than an empty corpse. Even if Bai Xiaochun became an archaean, he would still be powerless to resurrect him.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Bai Xiaochi\u2019s words struck Bai Xiaochun like bolts of heavenly lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cCalm down!\u201d Bai Xiaochi said, backing up a bit in fear. However, worried about the terrifying consequences of saying the wrong thing, he decided to explain everything he knew, and leave nothing out. \u201cListen, your Daoist partners\u2019 personal Life Essences have been severely damaged. That type of Essence cannot be restored with common life force. Ordinarily, you would need precious materials of heaven or earth to even attempt to do so, and even then, it would be quite difficult.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut we are not in any ordinary place\u2026. Things are different here. If we put them in the Daoist Tower of Life and Death, then their Life Essence will slowly build back up, and their cultivation bases will also progress!</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for your good friend\u2026 well, let me be perfectly clear right now. I'm not completely sure that I can resurrect him. Years ago, my original master told me that his purpose in creating his Dao Essence of Life and Death was to resurrect someone!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the end, he failed. But I think\u2026 that the Dao Essence of Life and Death really can resurrect people, although there\u2019s only a small chance of success\u2026. However, there will be a price to pay. If the Dao Essence in the tower is absorbed by your Daoist partners and your friend, then it will gradually weaken. And then, it won\u2019t be as easy for you to practice cultivation there. Furthermore\u2026 the end chance of success is small!</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure you want to do it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t hesitate for even a moment. Swishing his sleeve, he picked up Song Junwan, Zhou Zimo, and Song Que, and flew toward the fan face. As the owner of the fan, he actually didn\u2019t need any help from its spirit automaton to enter the fan face. In the blink of an eye, he was in front of the tower atop the mountain in the fan face.</p><br/><p>He placed Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo on the second floor. Any further would have been harmful to them, and not helpful.</p><br/><p>As for Song Que, he took a deep breath and, ignoring the pain and discomfort it involved, took him to the ninth floor. He couldn\u2019t stay in that location for long. After putting Song Que down, he looked at him, wished him well, and then left, anticipation crawling in his heart.</p><br/><p>He also carefully extracted Bruiser from the totem tattoo on Song Junwan\u2019s arm. He wasn\u2019t sure when Bruiser had picked up the ability to transform into a totem tattoo, but considering how talented he was, it wasn\u2019t a surprise. Bruiser was now in the late Deva Realm, very close to reaching the demigod level.</p><br/><p>The second floor wasn\u2019t the right place for Bruiser, but neither was the ninth floor. In the end, Bai Xiaochun found that the third floor was ideal.</p><br/><p>Having accomplished all of these things, Bai Xiaochun left the tower. After looking back at it for a long moment, he settled down cross-legged to meditate.</p><br/><p>He would stand guard\u2026 until Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo both woke up.</p><br/><p>Based on what Bai Xiaochi had told him, and based on what Bai Xiaochun knew of the Daoist Tower of Life and Death, he was sure that it wouldn\u2019t take very long\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

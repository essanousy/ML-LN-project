The exploding pill furnace had not only been shocking, but also a very close call....</span></p><br/><p>\u201cIf I had been just a bit slower, it would have blown up my immortal's cave! But that\u2019s not the scariest part. I might have lost my poor little life! That would have been a tragedy.\u201d Bai Xiaochun ducked his head down, trying to look apologetic to the furious crowd around him. He quickly made some adjustments to the cave\u2019s spell formation, and then hurried back inside.</p><br/><p>There, he braced himself to face a mob, but after an entire day passed, nothing happened. Surprised, he waited even longer, but no one ever showed up.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeird.... Oh well. I guess it doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll just keep concocting. Now why did that pill furnace explode?\u201d Sitting down cross-legged, he rubbed his chin thoughtfully.</p><br/><p>What he didn\u2019t know was that the reason nobody came looking for him was because of how people called him Nightdevil. He was already completely infamous, and although people wanted to go call him to account, the way he had slaughtered people with the blood sword left them no choice but to grit their teeth and endure.</p><br/><p>Another reason was that, although the explosion had been a powerful one, and caused a lot of fires, other than that, it didn\u2019t really influence anyone negatively....</p><br/><p>Three days later, Bai Xiaochun slapped his thigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the past, my tier-3 medicines also exploded. But this time, the explosion happened for a different reason. When tier-4 spirit medicines are in the final stages of condensing into a pill, they absorb qi from their surroundings, which leads to instability!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the bloodflame stones. The pill is being destroyed from the inside out!\u201d Panting, hair in disarray, eyes shining with enlightenment, he quickly rolled up his sleeves and produced a new pill furnace to work with.</p><br/><p>The concocting process went much more quickly this time. A day later, and the spirit medicine was already taking form. As it did, he paid close attention, and was also fully prepared for any outcome. Suddenly, the pill furnace began to turn bright red, and cracks started to spread out across its surface. A violent eruption was obviously building up, and the pill furnace even began to bulge in shocking fashion, even more dramatically than last time.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun gasped. Waving his sleeve, he collected up the pill furnace and then raced outside, where he threw it high up into the air. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have time to call out a warning this time....</p><br/><p>A deafening boom echoed out as the pill furnace exploded, sending shrapnel in all directions, along with waves of violet-colored flames....</p><br/><p>Booming thuds then rose up as the pieces landed on the ground. At the same time, enraged roars could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgain?! What are you doing, Nightcrypt?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt, are you really concocting medicine? If you want to kill us, why not just fight us!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat pill is he trying to concoct?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were about ten cultivators who were directly affected, and despite their rage, they didn't do anything other than gnash their teeth. They didn\u2019t dare to cause any problems for Nightcrypt.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun remained in his immortal's cave, terrified. However, after some time passed and nobody came to complain, he sighed and looked off into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou people understand the situation, and choose not to cause problems for me. Don\u2019t worry. I promise this will be the last time.\u201d Taking a deep breath at how sincere he was in his efforts, he once again began to concoct.</p><br/><p>Three days later....</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, what\u2019s wrong!?\u201d Feeling like he was going insane, he rushed outside and threw the pill furnace up into the air.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Five days later\u2026 <em>boom!</em> Seven days later\u2026 <em>boom!</em> Ten days later\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be happening?!\u201d He felt like he was going completely mad. This time, he threw an especially large pill furnace up into the air!</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOMMM!</p><br/><p>During the ten days that passed, Middle Peak was driven insane. Every day or two, another pill furnace would explode, raining down shrapnel and fire. Many places on Middle Peak were scorched to the ground.</p><br/><p>Many newly erected immortal's caves were burned to ash, and one cultivator after another was left screaming in rage. Eventually, not a single blade of grass or plant on Middle Peak was left unscorched.</p><br/><p>Although Master God-Diviner\u2019s immortal's cave wasn\u2019t harmed, he did catch on fire at least once....</p><br/><p>The killing intent of the Middle Peak cultivators continued to build until it seemed like it might explode.</p><br/><p>The situation was a bit better on the upper finger. However, the fires eventually spread that far too, and the mid and late Foundation Establishment cultivators there were slowly building up into a rage. All of Middle Peak was turning into a ticking timebomb.</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt, are you looking to die?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t kill Nightcrypt, then I\u2019m not human!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Does Nightcrypt want to burn Middle Peak to the ground? He\u2019s not concocting medicine, he\u2019s trying to kill us!\u201d</p><br/><p>The unusually large pill furnace that he threw up into the air didn\u2019t actually explode in until it landed. After it smashed into one of the blood waterfalls, a huge boom rang out, and masses of blood and water surged out in all directions. A miserable shriek rang out from Song Que\u2019s mouth as he emerged, engulfed in flames. His hair and eyebrows were almost immediately burned away.</p><br/><p>\u201cNightcrypt!!!\u201d he howled, shooting toward Bai Xiaochun\u2019s immortal's cave. His actions caused the suppressed emotions of the other cultivators to erupt, and they joined him in shouting at the tops of their lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill Nightcrypt!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Nightcrypt doesn\u2019t die, then we\u2019ll all be killed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFirst he messed with the blood qi, then he chased that rabbit, and now he has these exploding furnaces. Nightcrypt is a walking disaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead, Nightcrypt! You destroyed my immortal's cave during the blood qi incident, then again because of the rabbit, and now again with a pill furnace!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Never before had the cultivators of Middle Peak been united in such a way. Ninety percent of the cultivators, from early to late Foundation Establishment, raged with murderous auras as they shot toward Bai Xiaochun\u2019s immortal's cave, intent on joining hands to destroy it.</p><br/><p>Even if the sect prohibited such action, they didn\u2019t care. They were convinced that the sect wouldn\u2019t cause problems for all of the Foundation Establishment cultivators on Middle Peak because of a single person.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun saw what was happening, his scalp began to tingle with fear. Even though he was already in the mid Foundation Establishment stage, and was sure he could easily crush even a large group of opponents, it was a shock to see so many Foundation Establishment cultivators racing toward him, including both Mortal-Dao and Earthstring types, from the early to the late stage, all of them bristling with killing intent, and many without any hair or eyebrows.</p><br/><p>Song Que was leading them all, a pack of hornets whose howls shook the mountain peak like thunder.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen to me, people!\u201d Bai Xiaochun cried, face ashen from fear. Backing up, he tried to offer explanations, but his voice was drowned out by the howls of rage. As the people closed in, their cultivation bases surging with shocking power, they became like a wave of rage, upon which the rowboat which was Bai Xiaochun teetered on the verge of death.</p><br/><p>That was when a cold snort echoed from Ancestor Peak, a snort filled with frigid iciness. It pierced into the maddened minds of the mob, and all the cultivators who had been planning to attack Bai Xiaochun were instantly shaken to their souls.</p><br/><p>Only a prime elder or a patriarch would be able to calm down such a large group of people so quickly. It didn't matter who it was that had just snorted, it left everyone shaking.</p><br/><p>Simultaneously, Grand Elder Song Junwan appeared in front of Bai Xiaochun. Looking around coldly at the group of cultivators, she frowned and said, \u201cEnough is enough. Nightcrypt didn\u2019t do any of this on purpose. It's hard to avoid accidents when concocting medicine!\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding Foundation Establishment cultivators could say nothing in response. However, despite the fact that they feared and respected the grand elder, they were haughty and arrogant people by nature, and inwardly, were still just as angry as before. Even their eyes radiated a brutal coldness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe patriarch agrees on this point!\u201d Song Junwan continued coolly, her eyes radiating cold light. When the Foundation Establishment cultivators heard that, they had no choice but to sigh bitterly. Biting their tongues, they turned to leave. Of course, their hatred for Bai Xiaochun still burned hot inside of them.</p><br/><p>All of them were thinking the same thing: \u201cYou can\u2019t keep this up. The patriarch\u2019s patience has a limit, and sooner or later, you\u2019ll meet a bitter end!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inwardly, they chuckled coldly, filled with expectation for the day that Nightcrypt would be punished by the sect.</p><br/><p>After the crowd dispersed, fear still lingered in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart. Looking over at Song Junwan, he slapped his chest and said, \u201cThose people were being so unreasonable! I'm concocting medicine for the sect!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Junwan, who had already been turning to leave, looked back at Bai Xiaochun with a strange expression on her face. Then she shook her head. Even she would never have been able to imagine that pill concocting could prove to be so dangerous....</p><br/><p>After a moment of hesitation, she said, \u201cNightcrypt, you had better end up concocting a pill that pleases the patriarch.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she gave him a deep look, and then left.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to go into any more detail than that. She was sure that Nightcrypt would understand her meaning; the leadership of the Blood Stream Sect cared about the result, not the process. If, in the end, Nightcrypt was able to concoct a pill that pleased the patriarch, then everything that happened along the way wouldn\u2019t matter. As long as he didn\u2019t go too far, they wouldn\u2019t just ignore the mishaps; they would shield him from the consequences.</p><br/><p>However, if he failed to produce a satisfactory medicinal pill, then he would be viewed as useless, and the sect would demand restitution.</p><br/><p>Essentially, the more useful he was, the more they would use him, and the more powerful he would be in the sect!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered. Naturally, he understood what was going on. He had come to understand the way the Blood Stream Sect did things way back on Corpse Peak....</p><br/><p>\u201cThey look at the result, not the process.\u201d He sighed. \u201cWhat a great sect!\u201d Coughing dryly, he returned to his immortal's cave and continued concocting.</p><br/><p>Back on Ancestor Peak, the Song Clan patriarch was sitting in a large hall. Looking away from Middle Peak, he smiled at the two prime elders who were there to accompany him. All of them seemed quite pleased.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t Nightcrypt\u2019s concocting methods a bit excessive?\u201d one of the prime elders said with the shake of a head.</p><br/><p>The other prime elder chuckled. Sounding a bit sarcastic, he said, \u201cThat\u2019s what Blood Stream Sect disciples are supposed to be like. Don't concoct pills like everyone else! You can see at a single glance that he walks a devilish path. Everyone else concocts pills as if they\u2019re drinking warm water. He concocts them with explosive flair!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

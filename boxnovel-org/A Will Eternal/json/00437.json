What type of beast makes a sound like that?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! Even though we\u2019re outside of the trial by fire, we can still hear it! What kind of divine ability does that?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, on Starry Quarter Rainbow, there was a bright red mountain that rose high into the sky. At the top of the mountain was a young woman with hair like fire, sitting there meditating. She was very beautiful, and seemed to be surrounded by shapeless, invisible flames that would instantly eradicate anyone who got too close to her.</p><br/><p>Moments before, she had been completely focused on meditation, and hadn\u2019t been paying attention to the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars trials. But as soon as the beast roar echoed out, she detected it, and her expression flickered as she looked over in the direction of Myriad Star Rainbow.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd here I thought Gongsun Wan\u2019er would be the only one to make it onto the violet portion of the rainbow before the soul-hunting expedition. Apparently, I was wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>That young woman occupied 3rd place among the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars, Chen Yueshan!</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t the only one who noticed what was happening. In a deep cistern on Polarity Quarter Rainbow was a bare-chested young man with thin lips and cold eyes. He seemed like the completely merciless type, and was currently fighting a fierce battle with a host of vengeful souls. Despite the fierce attacks of the souls, they were being efficiently exterminated by the young man.</p><br/><p>As soon as the roar echoed out, he stopped in place and looked up, his eyes shining with mysterious light.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn't matter how many people get onto the violet portion of the rainbow. When the soul-hunting expedition begins, I\u2019ll kill anyone who gets in my way!\u201d</p><br/><p>This young man was one of the top superstars in the sect, who ranked even higher than Chen Yueshan. He occupied 2nd place, and was known by the Daoist name Heretic!</p><br/><p>Considering that the roar was so powerful even people outside of the trial heard it, there was little need to mention how it affected the statue of Gongsun Wan\u2019er. Her eyes began to shine brightly, and instead of backing up, she propelled the bone sword toward Bai Xiaochun with even greater speed than before.</p><br/><p>As it pierced through the air, it emitted ear-splitting whistling sounds!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s murderous aura skyrocketed as he shoved his hands high into the air and shouted, \u201c.... Kingdom!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ear-splitting rumbling sounds spread out as the entire 30,000-meter area turned into a huge, watery swamp. Then, an indescribably large spike rose up like a mountain out of the ground, filling the entire world. Beneath the enormous spike, it was possible to see black, scaled skin!!</p><br/><p>In addition, there were more spikes spreading out all over the creature below. The 30,000-meter area was actually like a window, allowing only a glimpse at the shockingly large beast beneath!</p><br/><p>As soon as the first huge spike appeared, it smashed into the statue of Gongsun Wan\u2019er, causing indescribable rumbling sounds to echo out. Everyone watching the scene gasped, and as for those who ranked higher in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars, they seemed to be the most shocked of all. That was especially true of Chen Yueshan and Heretic, both of whom looked on with widening eyes.</p><br/><p>Deafening rumbling sounds filled the entire blue trial by fire, sounds which surpassed heavenly thunder. It was almost like two continents colliding, releasing a destructive shockwave that instantly shattered Gongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s bone sword into countless fragments.</p><br/><p>At the same time, her statue dimmed and was covered with countless cracks, as though it might collapse at any moment as she sped backward in retreat. However, her bone sword was by no means ordinary in any way. Despite its physical form having been destroyed, its sword qi still existed, and it actually pierced all the way through the huge bone spike to Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>This was the first time anyone had ever pierced his Waterswamp Kingdom, and the sword qi moved so quickly that he had no time to evade it.</p><br/><p>When the sword qi hit him, blood sprayed out of his mouth, and his entire body was wracked with pain. Whether it was his bones or his flesh, he felt like he was about to explode, and he tumbled backward like a kite with its string cut.</p><br/><p>Apparently, these two opponents were evenly matched, and had just seriously injured each other!!</p><br/><p>Everyone on the outside felt their hearts being battered by waves of shock. Not only were they completely shaken by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s magical technique, but they were filled with fervor from being able to watch this most ultimate of Core Formation battles!</p><br/><p>It was easy to imagine how, even if Bai Xiaochun ended up losing in the end, he would still become quite the center of attention!</p><br/><p>\u201cBoth of them are almost on the same level as Nascent Soul experts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGongsun Wan\u2019er is already in the late Core Formation stage, but this Bai Xiaochun is only in mid Core Formation!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI asked around, and apparently Bai Xiaochun is from the River-Defying Sect in the Middle Reaches, and so is Gongsun Wan\u2019er! Heavens! I can\u2019t believe the River-Defying Sect is so incredible. Both of the hostages they sent are completely heaven-defying!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As everyone discussed the events playing out, back inside the blue trial by fire, the cracked statue of Gongsun Wan\u2019er looked up, her eyes shining with cold light. Then she reached up and placed her palm onto her forehead.</p><br/><p>A pop could be heard as her forehead collapsed, and more cracks spread out over her body. However, by opening her forehead, she apparently drew on the truly frigid coldness of her life essence, which erupted out with utter madness.</p><br/><p>As the frigid qi spread out, cracking sounds could be heard, and everything around the Gongsun Wan\u2019er statue was frozen. Within the blink of an eye, she transformed into an enormous ice giant, dozens of meters tall.</p><br/><p>If all that happened was that she became an ice giant, it might not have been a big deal. However, as she grew in size, a frigid qi began to swirl around her that seemed lethally cold, dropping the temperature in the 30,000-meter area so rapidly that, in the blink of an eye, everything was completely frozen!</p><br/><p>The frigid qi was so powerful that even the air froze, and the land began to crack to pieces!</p><br/><p>In fact, the only sound to be heard in the dimension were the popping sounds of everything freezing up!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Gongsun Wan\u2019er was only continuing to grow larger!</p><br/><p>\u201cFrigid Extermination!\u201d Everyone on the outside was so shaken that even the Nascent Soul experts were watching the fight, some of whom recognized where Gongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s frigid qi actually came from, leading to exclamations of astonishment.</p><br/><p>As more and more of the Nascent Soul cultivators picked up on the clues, their expressions flickered with shock. Even the sect leader of the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect emerged from his secluded meditation facilities to watch the fight.</p><br/><p>If they had such reactions, there was little need to even consider how everyone else was reacting. Within the blue trial by fire, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face fell as he sensed the exterminating power of the frigid qi. He could tell that, within moments, he would be frozen solid, killed in body and soul!</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! How did Gongsun Wan\u2019er get frigid qi like this!?!?\u201d In the critical moment, Bai Xiaochun looked around at everything rapidly freezing, and knew that he only had one option.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiving Mountain Incantation!\u201d As soon as the words left his mouth, the images of two stone golems appeared, one in each of his eyes. At the same time, a stone golem began to take shape around him!!</p><br/><p><em>After melding with the mountain, you become the mountain, and the mountain becomes you!</em></p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was no longer visible. Instead, what everyone saw was an enormous stone golem dozens of meters high!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the stone golem emitted an aura that would cause any Core Formation cultivator to be stricken with shock. Even the Nascent Soul cultivators were left gasping. As that energy surged out, it slammed into the frigid qi, resulting in a deafening explosion.</p><br/><p>Soon, cultivators on the outside recognized what it was that they were seeing, causing cries of astonishment to echo out. Even the Nascent Soul cultivators were shaken.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Living Mountain Incantation!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s Frigid Extermination had been shocking enough, but then the Living Mountain Incantation was thrown into the mix, leaving everyone thoroughly flabbergasted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe someone actually succeeded in cultivating the Living Mountain Incantation!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Bai Xiaochun is completely incredible!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even the sect leader had a very serious expression on his face.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, outside of the Ravine of Endless Mountains, Stonemountain sat there on the boulder, his eyes shining with a strange light. Apparently, his smile was one of excitement!</p><br/><p>As of this moment, a huge ice giant was facing off against an enormous stone golem, and the energy emanating off of the two was causing the entire blue trial by fire to tremble violently.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun howled.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Little Wolfgod himself sat stock still and completely expressionless on a balcony, watching two soul cultivators dueling in the courtyard below.</p><br/><p>Whoever prevailed in the duel would win Little Wolfgod\u2019s favor, and would be able to join him as a follower.</p><br/><p>To Little Wolfgod, it wasn\u2019t a very important matter, but to the two cultivators involved in the duel, it was quite the opposite. That was especially true of the weaker of the two opponents, who was a middle-aged man named Zhou Chenwu. In fact, the duel was so important to him that he had bought a portion of high-grade soul medicine and consumed it right before the fighting started. That had pushed him to much higher levels of power.</p><br/><p>The duel had been going on for some time when, all of a sudden, that Zhou Chenwu\u2019s face suddenly flickered. Then he fell back, a look of complete incredulity on his face. He looked like he was about to say something, but before he could, his opponent moved in for the kill.</p><br/><p>\u201cHold on, Li Linsen, I--\u201d His opponent completely ignored him, unleashing a magical technique before Zhou Chenwu could even finish speaking. Zhou Chenwu anxiously dodged to the side, but that motion apparently put pressure on his abdomen, and as he moved away, a shocking <em>phhhhhhrt</em> sound echoed out.</p><br/><p>In addition to the amazingly loud sound, Zhou Chenwu\u2019s pants\u2026 suddenly expanded outward as if they were being filled with air or gas\u2026. Moments later, the most noxious of odors imaginable began to spread out in the area.</p><br/><p>Zhou Chenwu\u2019s opponent Li Linsen was nearest, and was immediately blasted by the odor. Li Linsen had a Core Formation cultivation base, and would generally not be affected by toxic gases. However, this odor was so strong that his face fell, and he immediately felt sick to his stomach.</p><br/><p>Everyone watching the duel was stunned, and Little Wolfgod, who had closed his eyes moments before, suddenly opened them and looked over in shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was that sound\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis can\u2019t be right. Cultivators of our level don\u2019t eat food\u2026. Unless\u2026 maybe Zhou Chenwu is using some kind of special divine ability?\u201d</p><br/><p>Most of the audience was simply looking on in wide-eyed shock.</p><br/><p>As for Li Linsen, he had to suppress the urge to vomit as he angrily said, \u201cWhat are you doing, Zhou Chenwu?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Face scarlet, Zhou Chenwu replied, \u201cLet\u2019s end things for today, Fellow Daoist Li. We can reschedule the duel for another day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside, he was nearly going crazy. Completely unsure of what was happening, he turned to leave, howling miserably in his heart. He could feel his abdomen churning, and could even hear loud gurgling noises coming from the same area, noises that were completely embarrassing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s happening?!?!\u201d Even as Zhou Chenwu turned to leave, Li Linsen in his humiliation let out a shout and prepared to attack again. At this point, Zhou Chenwu\u2019s back was to him\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cStay away!\u201d Zhou Chenwu shouted urgently. \u201cI can\u2019t hold it in!!\u201d</p><br/><p>But he was too late\u2026. Li Linsen closed in and hit him on the back. At that point, Zhou Chenwu truly couldn\u2019t hold on any longer, and a thunderous <em>phhhhhhrt</em> rang out, followed by a burst of some gaseous substance\u2026. Before Li Linsen could do anything, the gas blasted into him.</p><br/><p>The noxious nature of the odor was even more intense than the last time, and Li Linsen was even closer. A scream erupted from his mouth, and he tumbled backward miserably.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pushing things too far, Zhou Chenwu!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Face burning red, Zhou Chenwu fled. As he went along, the <em>phhhhhhrt</em> sounds continued to echo out, and left behind clouds of gas the entire way\u2026.</p><br/><p>It was only after he was gone that the soul cultivators back in Little Wolfgod\u2019s home finally got around to reacting. When the noxious gas reached them, they immediately devolved into a hubbub.</p><br/><p>\u201cWas that\u2026 was that a fart?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cZhou Chenwu must have done it on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chaos ensued, and Little Wolfgod was immediately enraged. And that was only the first incident. After the time it takes an incense stick to burn, there was a second incident somewhere else in Arch-Emperor City. Then a third, and a fourth\u2026.</p><br/><p>The fourth incident was particularly shocking. In one bustling market in Borough 87, a beautiful female cultivator was surrounded by a cluster of male cultivators. The entire group was chatting merrily when, without any warning, the woman\u2019s face fell, and a loud <em>phhhrt</em> sound escaped into the open.</p><br/><p>The male cultivators all gaped in shock, and some blurted, \u201cWhat was that sound?\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, an indescribably noxious odor caused all of their faces to flicker. As for the female cultivator, she simply couldn\u2019t stop more thunderous <em>phhhhhhrt</em> sounds from exploding out\u2026.</p><br/><p>It sounded like a booming drum originating directly from the female cultivator. Eyes went wide, and numerous jaws dropped. As for the female cultivator, she began to scream, and tried to prevent what was happening, but was completely incapable.</p><br/><p><em>Phhhhhhrt! Phhhhhhrt!! Phhhhhhrt!!!</em></p><br/><p>Clouds of foul, noxious gas spread out in all directions into the crowded marketplace, causing numerous shouts of alarm to rise into the air. Panic ensued as people scrambled to escape.</p><br/><p>Such scenes played out not only in Borough 87, but also in Borough 88, Borough 86 and Borough 85. And even more incidents occurred in Borough 89.</p><br/><p>Chaos spread as the <em>phhhhhhrt</em> sounds and the foul gas began to fill the city. Anyone who encountered that odor felt as if they were being infected.</p><br/><p>Before long, clouds of gas covered large areas of the city\u2026.</p><br/><p>And yet, the most unimaginable aspect of the disaster was yet to come. Soon, the soul cultivators with the upset stomachs found that after expelling the gas, they started having diarrhea. The lucky ones were struck by the diarrhea when they were alone. Unfortunately, many were out in the open. Soon\u2026 agonized shrieks of madness began to fill all of the areas near Borough 89.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly is going on here!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t a sneak attack is it? It doesn\u2019t seem like it is!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho did this? Who\u2019s behind it!? I'm gonna kill \u2018em!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Miserable screams and roars of rage filled Arch-Emperor City.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun soon heard about what was happening, and even saw a soul cultivator outside of his shop unleashing an overwhelming stench onto the street. As the foul gas spread out, people scrambled to avoid it.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes went wide, and Bai Hao looked completely taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong,\u201d Bai Xiaochun muttered. \u201cThat smoke I added was supposed to cause diarrhea. Why is everyone farting\u2026?\u201d Nervous, he backed away from the gas, worried he might be infected. Then, his eyes went wide as he saw a second soul cultivator emitting <em>phhhhhhrt</em> sounds.</p><br/><p>Before long, a third could be seen, and then a fourth\u2026.</p><br/><p>In the time it takes an incense stick to burn, eight people on the street near his shop were all struck, and were sending foul gas out in all directions. Cries of alarm rang out as the passersby fell into pandemonium.</p><br/><p>His next-door neighbors Sima Tao and Sun Yifan also looked on in shock, and quickly ascertained that the gas would be impossible to dispel. Both necromancers were very unsettled.</p><br/><p>Suddenly feeling very nervous, Bai Hao looked out at the crazed populace, then turned to Bai Xiaochun and said, \u201cMas-Master\u2026 I'm pretty sure all of those people had high-grade soul medicine in their hands. Could it be that--\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep your voice down!\u201d Bai Xiaochun interrupted. Rushing forward, he slammed the door shut.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that I\u2019ve gotten rusty at concocting medicine? It was supposed to be diarrhea. Why is everybody farting? That odor is almost unbelievably noxious!\u201d Shaking his head gloomily, he thought back to all of the various accidents that had occurred back when he was into medicine concocting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really didn\u2019t do it on purpose this time\u2026. Who would ever have thought that things would turn out so crazy!?\u201d Heart pounding, he looked out through the door crack at the gas filling the street, and the fleeing soul cultivators. Some of them weren\u2019t able to take the stench, and began to pass out. When Bai Xiaochun saw that, his fear mounted.</p><br/><p>Trembling, he murmured, \u201cThat stench is so powerful! It affects everybody, regardless of their cultivation base\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

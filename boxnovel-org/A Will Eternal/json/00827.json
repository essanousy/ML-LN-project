Therefore, that plan never even entered his head. As he sat there in the turtle-wok in nascent soul form, his eyes snapped open, and they shone with explosively brilliant light!</p><br/><p>They looked like suns shining there within the private chamber, which echoed with sounds like rumbling thunder.</p><br/><p>Intensely powerful fluctuations filled the area as his power rose from that of the mid Nascent Soul stage to the late stage!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, because he had gone all the way to a nineteenfold spirit enhancement, he was actually very, very close to the great circle.</p><br/><p>If he performed a twentyfold spirit enhancement, then he would break through into the great circle. After that\u2026 was the legendary twenty-onefold spirit enhancement, which would make him a deva!</p><br/><p>Of course, that was only a legend. To date in the Arch-Emperor Dynasty, no one had ever done it. Whether it was because people lacked the information about how to do it, or whether there were other obstacles, it was impossible to say.</p><br/><p>In fact, throughout the history of the Arch-Emperor Dynasty, it would be easier to find a phoenix feather or a qilin horn than to find another person who had done the same thing Bai Xiaochun had by performing a nineteenfold spirit enhancement on their nascent soul.</p><br/><p>Already, Bai Xiaochun could tell that enhancing his nascent soul to this level had somehow caused him to be linked to heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwenty-onefold\u2026. Well, maybe it\u2019s not like the legends say, where you automatically break through. Maybe it just dramatically increases your chances of becoming a deva!\u201d However, now was not the time to ponder the issue. His nascent soul rose to its feet, leaped out of the wok, and returned to his fleshly body.</p><br/><p>He took three breaths, and then slowly opened his eyes, whereupon intensely powerful cultivation base fluctuations rolled out of him in all directions!</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUMBLE!!</p><br/><p>Not only did the power of his cultivation base cause everything around him to tremble, his battle prowess also rose dramatically. Before, he had been in the mid Nascent Soul stage, and had been capable of fighting with devas. Although he might not have been assured of victory, he could at least survive to make an escape. But now\u2026 he had broken through, and was half a step into the great circle. As of this moment, he\u2026 could definitely crush anyone in the early Deva Realm!!</p><br/><p>That was because of the power of his Heaven-Dao Nascent Soul, and also the boundless strength provided him by the Undying Codex!</p><br/><p>\u201cLei Shan!\u201d he growled. Taking a deep breath, he put his turtle-wok away and burst out of the private chamber like a bolt of lightning, leaving the chamber in ruins behind him.</p><br/><p>In the moment that he dashed out into the open, Lei Shan was glittering with black light as he unleashed a fist strike onto Mistress Red-Dust.</p><br/><p>Blood sprayed out of Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s mouth as she finally lost control of her injuries. Immediately, her vision began to grow dim, and she groaned. Exerting all effort possible, she once again tried to suppress her injuries. However, it was in that moment that Bai Xiaochun shot out into the open, scooped her up into his right arm, and then shoved his left hand in Lei Shan\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew off!!\u201d The movement of his hand seemed like an ordinary motion, but it caused all the light in the area to go dim, and a huge wind to kick up as a powerful attack swept toward Lei Shan.</p><br/><p>Lei Shan\u2019s eyes flickered with black light, and he tried to back up, but was just a bit too slow. Before he could move, the wind slammed into him.</p><br/><p>Intense rumbling sounds filled heaven and earth as Lei Shan coughed up a massive mouthful of black gore. Cracking sounds echoed out from inside of him as fissures opened up all over his body. Simultaneously, he was sent spinning backward by several hundred meters before landing hard onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Mistress Red-Dust was already in a bit of a daze as she looked up at Bai Xiaochun holding her. She seemed like she wanted to say something, but before she could, blood oozed out of her mouth and she lapsed into unconsciousness.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun descended to the ground and gently put Mistress Red-Dust off to the side. Then he looked up, his expression grim, his murderous aura raging in such a way that the sky distorted, and black clouds roiled above him.</p><br/><p>A terrifying aura pulsed out of him as he began to walk slowly toward Lei Shan.</p><br/><p>The black light in Lei Shan\u2019s eyes flickered with increasing rapidity. Only enough time had passed for an incense stick to burn, and yet Bai Xiaochun was completely different. Despite the fact that Lei Shan couldn\u2019t die, he suddenly felt an instinctual reverence inside of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cUndying body?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said slowly. Then he suddenly launched himself forward with incredible speed, leaving only a string of afterimages behind him. It was almost like a teleportation! In the blink of an eye, he was right in front of Lei Shan, his right hand rocketing forward in a fist strike!</p><br/><p>Lei Shan raised both hands in front of himself in defense, and for the first time, let out a growling shout like that of a cornered animal.</p><br/><p>A huge boom filled the area when Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fist strike made contact with Lei Shan\u2019s crossed arms. Instantly, Lei Shan realized that he couldn\u2019t defend against this blow, and before he could even react, began to shatter!</p><br/><p>Within the blink of an eye, his arms were shredded to pieces, and he was shoved backward across the ground. Then, before he could do anything else, Bai Xiaochun stepped forward again, placing himself right in front of Lei Shan.</p><br/><p>\u201cUndying body?\u201d Bai Xiaochun repeated. Then he smashed his right foot into Lei Shan\u2019s left leg. To Lei Shan, it felt like the weight of the heavens, and it was so powerful that his leg immediately exploded into a cloud of blood and gore. And that was when Bai Xiaochun headbutted him!</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</p><br/><p>Black gore exploded out of Lei Shan as more than half of his torso was destroyed. By now, the black light in his eyes was on the verge of flickering out.</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse to believe that you have a truly undying body!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, his eyes as cold as the winter wind. With that, he clenched his right hand into a fist, stepped forward, and struck the bedraggled Lei Shan yet again!</p><br/><p>Heaven and earth filled with a sound like booming thunder. The clouds above churned violently, and rain even began to fall down to the ground. As for Lei Shan, he stood there trembling, the black light in his eyes fading away. As it did, he looked at Bai Xiaochun and said, \u201cMy owner will come looking for you\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, more rumbling sounds could be heard, and then Lei Shan exploded into bits. Blood, flesh, and bones scattered about in all directions to land on the ground.</p><br/><p>The black blood soon began to be washed away by the rain. Meanwhile, the thunder above grew more intense, and the rain\u2026 fell harder.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s aura slowly grew steadier as he looked off in the direction where Gongsun Wan\u2019er was still sealed. A moment later, he went back to pick up the unconscious Mistress Red-Dust, then flew back to the heavenly airship. Beneath the falling rain, the airship rumbled to life, and became a bright beam of light that shot off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, tens of thousands of kilometers in a different direction, a muffled boom could be heard in the location where Mistress Red-Dust had sealed Gongsun Wan\u2019er with her Red Dust Violet Road technique.</p><br/><p>A shockwave spread out in all directions, razing the ground as it went along. At the same time, the hand-sized city suddenly shattered!</p><br/><p>Black smoke rose up from the remnants of city, which quickly formed together into the shape of a young girl. A moment later, the girl was gone, replaced by Gongsun Wan\u2019er. And then, she yet again became Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did you run away, sweetie? All I needed for my plan to be complete was for you to show up.\u201d Covering a smile with her mouth, she blurred into motion. A short while later, she appeared in the location where Lei Shan had been killed!</p><br/><p>As she hovered in the air, looking down at the ground, a frown grew on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you went and broke my teddy bear\u2026. Well, I guess I\u2019ll have to get a new one.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she looked up, her eyes shone with mysterious killing intent. Looking in the direction Bai Xiaochun had fled in, she began to move!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

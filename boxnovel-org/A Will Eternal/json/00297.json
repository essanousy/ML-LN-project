This turtle was simply too hurtful. Virtually every word out of his mouth was an insult.</p><br/><p>That was especially true of what he had just said. To say he was germophobic and didn't want to talk to Bai Xiaochun was an obvious insult to Bai Xiaochun himself.</p><br/><p>Rage burned in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes, and just when he was about to offer a response, the little turtle suddenly looked at him sympathetically. Shaking his head, he said, \u201cAh, some people have to be insulted really blatantly, otherwise they don\u2019t realize they\u2019re being insulted. Make things even slightly cerebral, and it takes them forever to realize they\u2019re being taunted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was on the verge of exploding.</p><br/><p>\u201cSharp-tongued blowhard!!\u201d he howled. \u201cBastard of a turtle! Y-y-you....\u201d</p><br/><p>However, the look of sympathy in the turtle\u2019s eyes grew even deeper. Sighing, he casually said, \u201cFinished with your self-introduction?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words crushed down onto Bai Xiaochun with the weight of Mount Tai, like lightning on a sunny day. Trembling as if he had been struck physically, he was literally at a loss for words. All of a sudden, he realized that in terms of ability to insult people, this little turtle existed on a different plane than him. It was like the difference between heaven and earth, or the difference between mortals and cultivators....</p><br/><p>They were different worlds....</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t the only one who felt like that. The other cultivators of the two sects were all left gasping. They had never encountered someone who could speak so bitingly. Xu Xiaoshan\u2019s eyes went wide as he stared at the little turtle. To him, it seemed almost godlike.</p><br/><p>Beihan Lie felt the same way. He had never before seen Bai Xiaochun in such a predicament. Jia Lie was going wild with joy, and although Master God-Diviner looked shocked, inwardly, he was getting very excited.</p><br/><p>Regardless, everyone had already decided that they would avoid talking to the little turtle at all costs....</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun waved his hand, causing blood qi to explode out toward the little turtle. However, before the blood qi even reached it, the turtle suddenly shrank back into his shell. A bang rang out as the blood qi hit the shell, then faded away, leaving behind not even the tiniest scratch.</p><br/><p>However, the turtle\u2019s muffled voice could still be heard from inside the shell.</p><br/><p>\u201cBursting with rage, yet empty inside. If you don\u2019t vent a bit, you\u2019ll end up dead. Listen up Bai, you little whippersnapper, Lord Turtle has some advice. Why don\u2019t you go build a crystal wall for yourself? If you keep going down this path, it\u2019s not healthy....\u201d [1. Even after doing a bunch of research, I couldn\u2019t determine exactly what the \u201cbuild a crystal wall\u201d is referring to. I think it\u2019s referencing the magical crystal walls that you see in animated shows sometimes. It\u2019s either that, or supposed to be something incomprehensible. I\u2019m not going to bug Er Gen about something minor like this, so I\u2019ll leave it up to your imagination ]</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s jaw dropped. He actually had no idea what the little turtle was talking about, but he was sure that it wasn\u2019t anything good. The fact that he didn\u2019t even understand how he was being insulted got him even more mad than before. Suddenly, he thought back to how the little turtle had just talked about people not understanding how they were being insulted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna concoct you into a pill!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun raged. Waving his right hand, he summoned a pill furnace, grabbed the turtle, and then threw it inside. Eyes bloodshot, he pulled out a pile of earthflame stones and immediately began to try to concoct the little turtle into a pill, right there on top of the blood sword.</p><br/><p>Strange expressions could be seen on the faces of the surrounding cultivators. Considering how Bai Xiaochun almost seemed to have gone mad, though, none of them dared to interrupt him. Everyone edged back until they were about 300 meters away.</p><br/><p>For the following few days, Bai Xiaochun concocted like mad. Soon, his hair was in disarray, and he felt like he was on the verge of exploding. However, no matter what methods he used, he couldn\u2019t get the little turtle to melt. Occasionally, the little turtle would even hurl insults out from inside the furnace.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou call this pill concocting? If you think this heat can melt Lord Turtle, you might as well stop dreaming. Look, whippersnapper, why don\u2019t you try again after practicing cultivation for 10,000 years or so?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey hey. Not bad! Not bad at all! You realized Lord Turtle was hungry, so you threw some spirit plants in for me to eat. Keep it up, whippersnapper. I'm starting to like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdd some heat! Come on, Lord Turtle is freezing here! Heat, man, I need heat!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was descending into complete madness. He felt like he was about to collapse, and had a mind to simply throw the little turtle away. However, it was a valuable treasure that he had only acquired after suffering untold hardships. He couldn\u2019t just give it up....</p><br/><p>And yet, he couldn\u2019t just allow things to go on the way they were. He continued to stew over the matter for two days, until he suddenly realized that the little turtle hadn\u2019t said anything for quite some time.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm?\u201d he muttered, looking surprised. Everyone else in the area was also astonished. They had actually gotten used to the little turtle\u2019s voice recently, so the sudden silence seemed odd.</p><br/><p>Feeling a bit suspicious, Bai Xiaochun cooled down the earthflame and opened the pill furnace to find that it was completely empty....</p><br/><p>Well, it wasn\u2019t completely empty. There were some turtle droppings inside....</p><br/><p>However, the little turtle was nowhere to be seen. By means of some unknowable method, he had somehow disappeared into thin air.</p><br/><p>A very unsightly expression could be seen on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face, especially when he looked at the turtle droppings. He really wanted to beat that turtle flat into the ground....</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmph! Well, I'm glad he\u2019s gone. I\u2019ll just pretend I never even picked him up to begin with!\u201d His heart was filled with many mixed emotions as he gritted his teeth and put his pill furnace away. Finally, the other cultivators felt comfortable enough to get a bit closer to the blood sword.</p><br/><p>Another five days passed. Bai Xiaochun hadn\u2019t seen a single trace of the little turtle, and had dismissed his disappearance from his mind. Although he was a bit disappointed at losing it, when he thought about his maddening way of talking, he realized that overall, the fact that he had fled was a good thing.</p><br/><p>His mood gradually got better, and his spirits lifted. One afternoon, just when he was getting everyone ready to continue along through the front lines territory, a golden beam of light suddenly shot up into the air off in the distance.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the aura of Heavenspan River water also exploded out in all directions. Heaven and earth began to tremble, and the sky distorted. Many of the blood clouds on the battlefield were swept away, and the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s white sun twisted, causing the black raven inside to tremble.</p><br/><p>The Blood Stream Sect\u2019s reserve power, the ghastly scarecrow, also began to tremble. The same thing happened to the Profound Stream Sect\u2019s enormous city headquarters.</p><br/><p>All patriarchs of the three sects who were currently in the Heavencraft Continent all turned their heads at the same time to see what was happening.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was quite close to the golden light, and felt the vibrations even more acutely. That was especially true considering that he cultivated the Violet Qi Heavenspan Incantation, which was built upon the foundation of absorbing Heavenspan River water. Because of that, he was more in tune with the Heavenspan River than ordinary cultivators.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s....\u201d Bai Xiaochun gasped. The other cultivators around him were so shocked they were trembling. And that was when all of them, Bai Xiaochun included, saw...</p><br/><p>Another beam shooting toward Bai Xiaochun from the expanding golden light.</p><br/><p>As the beam of light got closer, a voice suddenly echoed out, \u201cDammit! You trifling little creature. Last time Lord Turtle took a nap, you were a wimp, and the nap before that, your dad was also a wimp!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Bai Xiaochun heard that voice, he was shaken to the core, and his mind began to spin. It was obviously the voice of the damned little turtle.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, it was now possible to see that within the majestic golden light was a gargantuan crocodile!!</p><br/><p>It was at least 30,000 meters long, and completely golden. Its majesty was virtually impossible to describe, and it was clearly enraged, its roar echoing out louder than thunder from the heavens. [1. The golden crocodile appeared earlier in chapters 48 and 217]</p><br/><p>It was so angry that Bai Xiaochun could see how bloodshot its eyes were. He gasped, his scalp tingling so hard it felt like it would explode. This was the very same crocodile he had seen back when he was in the Qi Condensation stage, a terrifying entity that lived within the water of the Heavenspan River.</p><br/><p>Before Bai Xiaochun could even react, the little turtle shot toward him with explosive speed. As he closed in, he sucked his extremities in, becoming a turtle shell that then disappeared into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cUhh....\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked up with wide eyes at the distant crocodile, which was currently staring at him angrily. Clearly, it recognized him.... When it realized that Bai Xiaochun was the master of the little turtle, it let out a shocking roar that caused the sky to dim, and a huge wind to kick up.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Goldcroc, I... I'm not the turtle\u2019s master! Really, I\u2019m not....\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to drag the turtle out of his bag of holding, but when he looked inside, he couldn't find a single trace of him. There was no more time to think, as the terrifying crocodile was currently heading in his direction. A pair of wings popped out behind Bai Xiaochun as he fled at top speed.</p><br/><p>On the verge of tears, he screamed, \u201cHeaven-damned little turtle, I hate you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other cultivators had long since fled, and were sympathetically watching Bai Xiaochun from a distance....</p><br/>\n</div>"}

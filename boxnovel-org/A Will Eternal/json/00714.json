They weren\u2019t particularly impressed with the first part of what he had said, but the last part left them gasping in astonishment. They actually didn\u2019t know about Zhou Zimo\u2019s relationship to the Giant Ghost King, but he was their king after all. To hear the person he had sent say something like this was a huge shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sergeant major is his fianc\u00e9e?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this for real? This Bai Hao\u2026. I remember hearing about him. He\u2019s one of the top aides to his highness the king\u2026. Could it be that the king is rewarding him by arranging this marriage?\u201d The powerful experts who had been shocked by Duke Deathcrier\u2019s sudden appearance earlier had also heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s shocking words, and as a result, their expressions flickered. They looked incredulously at Bai Xiaochun, and then examined his identity medallion to confirm who he was. Although strange expressions could be seen on their faces, they didn\u2019t dare to delay, and quickly relayed the information up the chain of command to request orders about what to do next.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was very pleased at the reaction to his words, and mused that his days as a major general had truly given him an imperious way with words that surpassed ordinary people. Feeling quite proud, he cleared his throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, I\u2019m coming in now.\u201d As he began to strut forward, the soul cultivators of the Giant Ghost Legion exchanged awkward glances, but didn't dare to get in his way. However, before he could take more than a few steps, a beam of light shot toward the entrance from somewhere in the middle of the camp, resolving into the shape of a young woman.</p><br/><p>As soon as she arrived, all of the surrounding soldiers breathed sighs of relief.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t appear to be very old, and had a Core Formation cultivation base. She was very pretty, with snow-white skin, and eyes that sparkled brightly. There was something formidable about her, but at the same time she was extremely attractive. That was especially the case considering that she wore a suit of tight-fitting leather armor that perfectly accentuated her sensuous curves.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun immediately perked up a bit as he wondered if this was Zhou Zimo. However, considering the level of her cultivation base, it didn't seem likely\u2026. After looking her up and down, he was just preparing to say something when she coolly said, \u201cCome with me. The sergeant major wants to see you!\u201d</p><br/><p>There was little respect to be heard in her tone of voice, and after finishing speaking, she turned and headed back into the camp. As she walked away, Bai Xiaochun simply couldn\u2019t help but once again marvel at her attractive figure.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, she\u2019s not Zhou Zimo after all. Hmph. Quite the nerve she has!\u201d He was definitely not very pleased at his reception so far. No matter what the situation was, he was still the famed majordomo of Giant Ghost City. However, Bai Xiaochun also reminded himself that he wasn\u2019t the type to nitpick, so he simply snorted and followed the young woman.</p><br/><p>As he walked along, he thought about what the Giant Ghost King\u2019s mysterious daughter would be like. Considering what the king had said to him, she was even more incredible than Chen Manyao.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he was lying to me, then I\u2019ll figure out some reason to leave Arch-Emperor City and get back to Giant Ghost City.\u201d Having made up his mind, he swaggered after the young woman into the camp. As he looked around, he could see quite a few people looking over at him with quizzical expressions, occasionally leaning over to whisper to each other.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho's that? I can\u2019t believe the sergeant major\u2019s personal guard is escorting him\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just heard some voices from outside. Supposedly this guy claims to be the sergeant major\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the whispered conversations reached his ears, Bai Xiaochun felt prouder of himself than ever. As he made his way through the army camp, he realized that it was quite large. Based on his estimates, there were probably around 1,000,000 troops garrisoned here. Tents stretched out in all directions, seemingly without end.</p><br/><p>There was something stern and harsh to the camp that made Bai Xiaochun think about the Great Wall.</p><br/><p>As the young woman hurried him through the camp, Bai Xiaochun got the strange sensation that some of the people around him seemed familiar. However, there was little time to ponder the situation as the female cultivator led him to a huge red tent in the middle of the camp!</p><br/><p>It was fully 300 meters wide, and considering that evening was falling, it was already lit by flickering torches.</p><br/><p>It was heavily guarded, and the entire area radiated a bleak and deadly air. All of the guards had completely expressionless faces. Even as Bai Xiaochun and the personal guard approached, their gazes remained completely icy, as if they didn\u2019t care who Bai Xiaochun was. If he showed the slightest errant behavior, they would all attack him immediately!</p><br/><p>It was at this point that his heart quivered a bit. Although he had been hurried through the camp, he could still sense that there were many powerful experts present. From what he could tell, some of them were even half a step into the Deva Realm. However, he couldn't sense any aura at all coming from inside the bright red command tent. Even as he approached, he heard a cold snort echo out from inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still haven\u2019t found him?!\u201d It was the voice of a woman, and it sounded like she was growling through clenched teeth. There was something incredibly shocking about her, as though she could surpass heaven and earth. The way the air vibrated sent a twinge of fear through Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat aura\u2026 it's from a deva!\u201d There was even something about the aura that seemed familiar. Before he could spend any time thinking about it though, a rumbling sound could be heard as a statue flew out from inside the tent.</p><br/><p>The statue depicted a person, and was already shattering to pieces as it flew out of the tent. However, most of the head remained intact, and it rolled across the ground until it came to a stop at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>When he looked down at it, his eyes went wide, and all the hair on his body stood on end.</p><br/><p>The portion of the head that remained intact revealed a fact that looked much like his own\u2026. Not Bai Hao\u2019s face, but his true appearance\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis\u2026 this\u2026.\u201d he muttered.</p><br/><p>Before he could collect his thoughts, the woman\u2019s voice could once again be heard inside the tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cKeep looking! I refuse to believe that we can\u2019t find that damned Bai Xiaochun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun shivered, and a look of disbelief appeared on his face. Whether it was the aura he was sensing, or the voice, there was something so familiar with it that if he couldn't place who it was by this point, it would mean he had memory problems.</p><br/><p>Although he was now sure of who this person was, he still couldn\u2019t bring himself to believe it was true\u2026. Even as he stood there shivering, the tent flap opened, and another female guard appeared. An unsightly expression could be seen on her face as she completely ignored Bai Xiaochun and began to clean up the shattered pieces of the statue.</p><br/><p>However, because of the tent flap suddenly being opened, Bai Xiaochun could now see inside to a woman sitting there. When he saw her face, he felt like a million lightning bolts were striking his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cMistress Red-Dust!\u201d His face turned as pale as a sheet, and his legs began to shake. Sitting there in the tent was the very same person he had cursed in his heart over and over again, the same person with whom he had fought in the necropolis\u2026 Mistress Red-Dust!!</p><br/><p>Never could he possibly have imagined that the Giant Ghost King\u2019s daughter would be Mistress Red-Dust\u2026. Clearly, Zhou Zimo was her name, and Red-Dust was a Daoist name.</p><br/><p>Shaken, he suddenly realized why so many people in the army had seemed familiar. These were the very same necromancers and soul cultivators who had participated in the war at the Great Wall\u2026.</p><br/><p>He had even fought some of them personally, and many of them had cursed him to death because of his Soul Convergence Pills\u2026.</p><br/><p>A few had even experienced incredible humiliation because of the enormous beasts that had consumed his enhanced Aphrodisiac Pills. These were people who hated Bai Xiaochun with an undying passion that defied description.</p><br/><p>In fact, in all of the Wildlands, nobody hated him more\u2026 than this group of people!</p><br/><p>Back when he had been at the Great Wall, information about the Wildlands had been very hard to come by for some reason. Even after becoming a major general, he hadn\u2019t learned very much about the Wildlanders other than that they were all enemies. He\u2019d never been given any information about the specific forces they faced, or where they came from.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! The Giant Ghost Legion\u2026 Mistress Red-Dust\u2026 heavens! What am I doing here!?!? I've been dropped into the lion\u2019s den!!\u201d As he wailed in his heart, and as his mind reeled, he shivered and backed up a step. His first instinct was to flee from this place as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>The mere idea of what would happen if his identity were revealed filled him with intense anxiety\u2026.</p><br/><p>However, before he could do anything, Mistress Red-Dust's cold voice echoed out, \u201cWho\u2019s sneaking around out there!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding guards\u2019 gazes instantly locked onto Bai Xiaochun, and the killing air that rose up was readily apparent. Even the female guard who was cleaning up the shattered statue looked at him with cold eyes.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun really wanted to cry as he stood there, wilting inwardly as everyone looked at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I do, what do I do\u2026? I hate you, Giant Ghost King\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>There he stood, unsure of how to respond, heart pounding with fear. Then, Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s cold voice again rang out from within the tent.</p><br/><p>\u201cTake him away and execute him!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/>\n</div>"}

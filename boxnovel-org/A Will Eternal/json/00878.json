There was no way he could. How could he possibly explain that Gongsun Wan\u2019er had actually been killed long ago in the Fallen Sword Abyss?</p><br/><p>It would be too cruel to tell Gongsun Yun that the little sister he had seen afterward was really that bizarre girl. Bai Xiaochun simply couldn\u2019t bear to deliver such a bitter blow.</p><br/><p>Instead, he told Gongsun Yun a story in which his sister sacrificed her life as a hero.</p><br/><p>The story he told wasn\u2019t without its flaws, and apparently Gongsun Yun realized that. But he didn\u2019t ask any follow-up questions\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle sis, was that really you who came back to the sect\u2026?\u201d he thought. The truth was that he had asked himself that same question on many occasions, and didn\u2019t really want to know the answer\u2026.</p><br/><p>After Gongsun Yun left, Bai Xiaochun felt even worse than before. He didn\u2019t like feeling like this. He liked being happy and having fun. However, as he grew up, he realized that such emotions were inescapable.</p><br/><p>Oftentimes in the past, he was able to bury such feelings, but right now, all the graves he had seen caused Zhou Xinqi\u2019s face to float in his mind even more clearly than before, as well as many other familiar faces. They were images he simply couldn\u2019t dispel.</p><br/><p>**</p><br/><p>At the moment, no other patriarch in the sect had a better chance of becoming a deva than Patriarch Spirit Stream. He was in a better position than even Patriarch Blood Stream.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Spirit Stream could sense the bleakness of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mood. As he looked at him from a distance, he could tell from the fluctuations of his divine sense how sorrowful he was. Although he didn\u2019t understand Bai Xiaochun as well as Li Qinghou did, he had been there to watch him grow into the person he was.</p><br/><p>At some indefinite point, he appeared next to Bai Xiaochun, although he didn\u2019t interrupt him. He just stood there, looking at all of the graves of the River-Defying Sect.</p><br/><p>Eventually, when the time was right, he spoke in a hoarse voice filled with age.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaochun, look around\u2026. Can you tell what\u2019s different about the sect\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had long since become aware that Patriarch Spirit Stream had come to stand next to him. However, he was in too bad of a mood to say anything. In response to the patriarchs words, he looked around.</p><br/><p>The sect was filled with a buzz of noise as all sorts of repair work went underway. Everyone was toiling away. Although nothing dramatic was happening, close examination revealed that the sect was rapidly returning to its previous state. It wouldn\u2019t be long before it thrummed with just as much life as before.</p><br/><p>As for all of the disciples of the three sects who had been captured, they were important bargaining chips that could either be absorbed into the sect as new disciples, or traded with the three sects for remuneration.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know what\u2019s different?\u201d Patriarch Spirit Stream asked again. \u201cDo you know why all of the disciples are working so hard? Do you know why they are all so focused\u2026? Because this isn\u2019t just their sect. It\u2019s their home!</p><br/><p>\u201cSpirit Stream Sect. River-Defying Sect. It doesn\u2019t matter. They\u2019re the same. The good fortune of the disciples is the good fortune of the sect. That\u2019s the most important thing. As long as the disciples have enough faith and trust in the sect, then\u2026 the sect will be their home!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd the truth is that our sect\u2026 is a home to all of us, patriarchs included!\u201d Patriarch Spirit Stream was very, very old, and in fact, if it weren\u2019t for the fact that he relied on a special secret magic, he would have long since perished. Perhaps because of that secret magic, or perhaps because of the dramatic events that the River-Defying Sect had seen in recent years, his face was covered with even more wrinkles than ever, making him seem even more ancient.</p><br/><p>At this point, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mood stopped sinking. However, there was still something gnawing at his mind. Slowly but surely, he looked over at the patriarch.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch\u2026 don\u2019t we cultivators practice cultivation so that we can live forever? Why do we have to go around fighting and killing all the time? As long as we're alive, there are endless possiblities! But once we die\u2026 then what\u2019s the point of it all\u2026?\u201d This question had been lodged deep in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart for many years, and would not go away.</p><br/><p>It was a profound question, and in response, Patriarch Spirit Stream simply stood there quietly for a moment. The truth was that he didn\u2019t have an answer. A long moment passed, and he seemed to grow a bit older. Then he looked back at Bai Xiaochun, his eyes warm but tinged with pain.</p><br/><p>It was pain because of the sorrow he felt for his most outstanding of all the Spirit Stream Division disciples. After all, he knew that from the first day Bai Xiaochun had joined the sect, he had feared death and dreamed of being able to live forever.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Spirit Stream had watched this disciple tackle the brutal cultivation world, and yet never forget his dream of living forever. There was a purity and innocence in that which was very, very rare.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaochun\u2026\u201d he said softly. \u201cYou\u2019re right. As long as we\u2019re alive, there are endless possibilities. But just because we die doesn\u2019t mean that our hopes and dreams die with us!</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t speak for anyone else, but I can say that when I look at all of these graves, I'm absolutely certain\u2026 that these disciples who died in battle did it because of the Dao that existed in their hearts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean Dao?\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied, confused. He had been asked a similar question back in the rainbow trial by fire in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect. And although he had never answered the question, he had the vague feeling that his Dao\u2026 was to live forever.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe word <em>Dao</em> is profound and deep,\u201d the patriarch answered. \u201cNo one can really explain it perfectly\u2026. As for me, only by living for many, many years have I been able to experience what it means\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cDao is <em>focus</em>. Think about all of these heroes who fell in battle. Do you think they weren\u2019t afraid of death? Do you think they didn\u2019t want to live forever? They were afraid. And they did want to live forever! But the sect was their home, and they were fighting to defend and protect it. They were willing to sacrifice their own lives, even to the point of giving up on their own wishes and desires. No matter how much it pained them, they swore to die defending their home!</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for me, I long since made up my mind. Even if everyone else managed to escape, I would stay behind. If our sect goes down in flames, I will go with it!</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same with you, Xiaochun\u2026? Back in that battle in the Luochen Mountains, why did you go back to save your fellow disciples? Didn\u2019t you know that if you went back, you might die?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would have happened if, instead of facing three devas earlier, it was three demigods\u2026? Would you have come to fight? Or would you have lingered in the distance, watched us die, and then fled?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words struck Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart like a lightning bolt. He had never thought of questions like this before, and wasn\u2019t even sure how to answer them. The truth was that in the sect\u2019s moment of impending doom, he hadn\u2019t been thinking of anything. He just couldn\u2019t stand to watch it be wiped out in front of him, and had felt he had no choice but to advance into battle.</p><br/><p>As he pondered these matters, he was suddenly struck by a revelation. Although his focus in life was to live forever\u2026 there were too many other things in the world he cared about. He couldn\u2019t simply forget about those things, and that meant that, even if he didn\u2019t like it, sometimes he had to resort to fighting and killing. It was like a natural law of heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>When danger threatened his friends, his family, his sect, or his home, then it didn\u2019t matter how much he wanted to live forever. He would always do the same thing!</p><br/><p>He would always make the same choice!</p><br/><p>\u201cLife and death\u2026.\u201d Considering how many years Patriarch Spirit Stream had lived, and the state of his longevity, when he talked about life and death, it somehow seemed more meaningful.</p><br/><p>\u201cSometimes, you might be alive\u2026 and yet be dead to certain people\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd sometimes, you might be dead, and yet be alive\u2026. Zhou Xinqi perished, but she lives for all time in Shangguan Tianyou's heart! That black dog is dead, but exists eternally for Beihan Lie!</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at all the names on these graves, Xiaochun. These disciples died in battle, but from now on, everyone in the River-Defying Sect will remember them! Who will ever dare to forget them!?\u201d Patriarch Spirit Stream spoke with decisiveness that could sever nails and chop iron. His words were like a thunderclap that resonated in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind and heart, causing a tremor to pass through him. It was almost as if a door had been opened inside of him, making certain thoughts and feelings which had once been obscured to suddenly be as clear as day.</p><br/><p>His eyes flickered with enlightenment at the profound implications of the words which had just been spoken. He suddenly felt as if he understood the meaning of life and death, and also understood why he would always make that one particular choice. It was because\u2026 of focus!</p><br/><p>Although grief still existed in his heart, the more he thought about his new understanding, the more that grief resembled respect. Then he clasped hands and bowed deeply to all of the graves! Even after a long moment, he didn\u2019t rise from his bow.</p><br/><p>\u201cI understand now, Patriarch\u2026.\u201d he murmured. He was bowing to those who had died in battle, to their sacrifice, to their fearlessness. He was bowing\u2026 to the souls of true heroes!</p><br/><p>As long as the sect existed\u2026 then these disciples who had fallen in battle would live in the hearts of the sect, for all eternity!</p><br/><p>They had died, but would exist for all time!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

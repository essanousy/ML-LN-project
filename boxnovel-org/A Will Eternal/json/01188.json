After all, Bai Xiaochun had just killed Celestial Deadfall and seriously injured Reverend Devourer, leaving all of them quite shaken.</p><br/><p>Some, such as Prince Ur-Demon, were so frightened that they only dared to send out divine sense, and even then, let Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a take the lead.</p><br/><p>Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a, on the other hand, was the strongest celestial in Vile-Emperor City, and had long since come to hate Bai Xiaochun. He had become suspicious of him back when they were both on the damaged fan, and had also suffered at his hands during the incident with the sovereign clone. Therefore, he did not hesitate at all to intervene when Bai Xiaochun tried to break open the spell formation.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked up, aware that if Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a hindered him in opening the spell formation, then the other celestials from Vile-Emperor City would also come.</p><br/><p>Then, not only would he be in great danger, but it would also be impossible to save Patriarch Spirit Stream and the others. And that was without even mentioning the fact that the Vile-Emperor could also show up eventually.</p><br/><p>Not much time had passed since he made his move, and he didn\u2019t dare to gamble on how long the Vile-Emperor would remain in secluded meditation. If he emerged, then it could lead to a complete catastrophe!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, killing Deadfall didn\u2019t scare them. Well, if I can make Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a stand down, then that should strike fear into their hearts!\u201d Knowing he had no other choice, he threw his head back and roared, drawing fully upon his cultivation base to shove the Greatsword of the North down toward the spell formation!</p><br/><p>A boom rang out as the sword stabbed into the formation, which trembled violently, but held. However, stabbing the sword into the formation not only reduced some of the danger to those inside, it also made it much more difficult for the formation to repair itself.</p><br/><p>Looking up, Bai Xiaochun unleashed shocking fleshly body and cultivation base power as he shot toward Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a!</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a death wish?!\u201d It wasn\u2019t that Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a hadn\u2019t seen Bai Xiaochun kill Deadfall. It was that he still believed that, even if Bai Xiaochun were stronger than he was, he could still be handled. And that was especially true now that he wasn\u2019t wielding his Greatsword of the North.</p><br/><p>As the two closed in on each other, Bai Xiaochun unleashed the Undying Emperor\u2019s Fist at nearly the highest level it could reach.</p><br/><p>A huge boom rang out, causing wild colors to flash in heaven and earth. Blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mouth as he staggered backward. Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a was equally shaken, his eyes shining brightly, and his heart swelling with shock. Even he was surprised by the fist strike Bai Xiaochun had just unleashed.</p><br/><p>Before he could attack again, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s wounds were healing up, and a ferocious smile could be seen on his face as he unleashed\u2026 yet another Undying Emperor\u2019s Fist!</p><br/><p>Deafening rumbling sounds could be heard as blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mouth again. And yet, he didn\u2019t hold back. In the blink of an eye, Bai Xiaochun attacked and was rebuffed five times in a row. And yet, Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a was having a hard time sustaining the force, and staggered backward, coughing up blood.</p><br/><p>Looking livelier than ever, Bai Xiaochun lunged after him. Off in the distance, Prince Ur-Demon and the other celestials gasped at the sight of what was happening.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun seemed to be gripped by madness, and was doing things that none of them could ever have imagined him doing. To them, he seemed completely different from the past. As of now, he clearly pulsed with veins of steel!</p><br/><p>He was obviously injured, to the point where he was coughing up mouthfuls of blood. Even with his powers of regeneration, it didn't seem like he should be able to sustain such terrible injuries.</p><br/><p>In the face of such madness and such veins of steel, even the valiant Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a was coughing up blood, and finally seemed to be hesitating.</p><br/><p>Wiping the blood off of his mouth, Bai Xiaochun said, \u201cBring it on!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>With that, he blurred into motion, unleashing more Undying Emperor\u2019s Fists, causing all heaven and earth to tremble as shadowy emperors unleashed a torrent of destruction. He seemed to completely disregard any injuries to himself as he fought with increasingly shocking battle prowess!</p><br/><p>With the Undying Codex bolstering him, Bai Xiaochun seemed beyond the point of coming to a compromise. He would either kill his opponent, or die trying!!</p><br/><p>As his murderous aura raged, Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a struggled to fight back. After coughing up seven huge mouthfuls of blood, his face fell.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really trying to get killed, Bai Xiaochun!?\u201d he shouted. There was nothing for Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a to do other than shout and curse. As of this moment, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s arm was in shreds, his bones visible beneath the skin. He was coughing so violently that the blood that came out was filled with chunks of internal organs.</p><br/><p>And yet, Bai Xiaochun was in such a state of madness, and his murderous aura was so intense, that Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a was already hesitating about whether to keep on fighting. At this point, even winning could place him in grave danger!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt's not worth it!\u201d He suddenly shot backward in the face of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s next attack. Although it was a big loss of face, the danger was too great. Just like Reverend Devourer, he chose to flee, and even regretted having gotten involved to begin with.</p><br/><p>Off in the distance, Prince Ur-Demon and the other celestials saw what was happening, and gasped in shock. After exchanging stunned glances, they turned to head back into the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew it. As long as he doesn\u2019t cause problems in the city, we should just leave him alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy is obviously crazy\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Vile-Emperor might be in secluded meditation, but if things keep going on like this, he\u2019ll definitely come out and take care of things!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ignoring the fleeing Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a, Bai Xiaochun flew back down to the Greatsword of the North. Panting for breath, he grabbed it by the hilt and then yanked it out of the spell formation. Even as his wounds healed up, he drew upon both his cultivation base and fleshly body power to slash the sword downward again.</p><br/><p>\u201cOpen up!\u201d</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</p><br/><p>He hit the very spot where he had stabbed the sword into the formation, causing cracks to spread out in all directions. Then, the spell formation exploded!</p><br/><p>As the dust settled, the tens of thousands of Heavenspan Realm cultivators who had been inside looked up. Despite being weakened, they knew that they now had a new lease on life. And then they saw Bai Xiaochun. Although some didn\u2019t recognize him, many were his friends. And many began to shed tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cArch-Ancestor!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the Arch-Ancestor!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Arch-Ancestor came to rescue us!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t keep a calm heart in the face of such exclamations. Almost immediately, he focused on Li Qinghou and Patriarch Spirit Stream, who looked profoundly weakened by this point. Rushing over to Li Qinghou, he reached out to help him to his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Li!\u201d</p><br/><p>Considering how long it had been since they had last seen each other, it should have been a joyous reunion. And although Li Qinghou was visibly excited, his face suddenly turned grim, and he gripped Bai Xiaochun\u2019s shoulders tightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaochun,\u201d he said, sounding very anxious, \u201cyou have to go save Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo!!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun heard that, a tremor passed through him, and he suddenly couldn\u2019t breathe. He had been searching for news of those two very women for many years, only to hear their names now, in this moment of critical danger.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey were taken away by the Vile-Prince!\u201d Li Qinghou continued, \u201cYou have to rescue them!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Looking just as anxious as Li Qinghou, Patriarch Spirit Stream added, \u201cXiaochun, they\u2019re pregnant! And considering how the two of them have been acting around each other\u2026 you have to be the father! I'm not sure why they\u2019ve been pregnant for so long, but from what Junwan told me, she\u2019s definitely bearing your child. Go, save them!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWHAT?!?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was as struck to the core as if he had been hit by lightning. Although others might not understand the situation, based on what the Giant Ghost King had told him, he knew that it was because of his bloodline and the Undying Live Forever Codex that the pregnancy terms of both women had been extended in such dramatic fashion. As of this moment, what he had felt before almost didn\u2019t count as being angry. As of this moment, he felt more fury than could be imagined!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

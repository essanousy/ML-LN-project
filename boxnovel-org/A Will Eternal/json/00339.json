It was far larger than any of the preceding lightning bolts, and caused the entire sky to turn the color of gold as it sped toward Bai Xiaochun\u2019s three-meter Gold Core.</p><br/><p>The crushing pressure exuded by that lightning bolt was both the strongest and the final round!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun let out a long cry as he released all the power of his cultivation base. His Undying techniques were in full swing, and his will, soul, and everything else about him was completely and utterly focused. Nothing else in the world even existed at the moment. His mind was devolving into chaos, and yet, there was one thing that remained....</p><br/><p>\u201cI must form this Gold Core! I want to live forever!!\u201d Without even realizing what he was doing, he threw his head back and roared, then shot up into the air toward the Gold Core.</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUMBLE!</p><br/><p>From a distance, it was just possible to see him arriving at the Gold Core at exactly the same time as the bolt of lightning!</p><br/><p>As of this moment, heaven and earth were turning blurry, the sky was shaking, and the land was being rocked back and forth!</p><br/><p>As of this moment, so much golden light filled the world that it became the only color in existence!</p><br/><p>As of this moment, it was almost impossible to even distinguish Bai Xiaochun from the lightning, as both merged into the Gold Core!</p><br/><p>As of this moment, every person on the battlefield was completely focused on the events playing out above!</p><br/><p>No longer was the lightning visible, nor Bai Xiaochun. Not even the Gold Core itself could be seen.</p><br/><p>The only thing it was possible to see now was a field of endless gold!</p><br/><p>No one was able to determine whether Bai Xiaochun had succeeded. The ancient records didn\u2019t contain detailed information about what could happen in a scenario like this. They only contained a general overview; currently, no one had any idea to judge what was happening.</p><br/><p>The only thing they could do now was wait!</p><br/><p>The Heaven-Dao pressure slowly began to dissipate, and the golden light started to fade....</p><br/><p>Everyone was looking anxiously up into the sky, countless thoughts running through their minds. However, all of them realized that this would likely be both the first and last time any of them ever saw someone reach Heaven-Dao Gold Core!</p><br/><p>It was the same in both the River-Defying Sect and the Sky River Court.</p><br/><p>As for the young man who had been fighting Bai Xiaochun earlier, he was shaking all over. The idea of Bai Xiaochun reaching Heaven-Dao Gold Core filled him with a level of dread he could never have even imagined before.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to succeed!\" he shouted to himself, his expression distorting with rage. \u201cThere\u2019s no way!!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, even as the young man shouted to himself, the gold light faded away completely, and everyone caught sight of Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>There he hovered, his eyes closed, his hair floating around him, his arms outstretched. Golden light shone from him, making him look like a celestial being. Everyone was completely shaken.</p><br/><p>That was when his eyes suddenly snapped open!</p><br/><p>Instantly, rumblings like thunder echoed out in all directions, and at the same time, terrifying cultivation base fluctuations rolled out.</p><br/><p>That was something that a Foundation Establishment cultivator could not accomplish. That was something that came only with the power of a Gold Core!!</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!\u201d the young man cried, his mind spinning. Cries of alarm rang out from the Sky River Court, whereas cheering could be heard from the River-Defying Sect.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid it work!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Patriarch!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaochun!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as the cheers rang out, Bai Xiaochun hovered there, somewhat in a daze. He could sense the cultivation base power coursing through him, and felt his previous injuries and wounds vanishing. The power he was experiencing was not just from his fleshly body; it was a comprehensive power that gave him the feeling that a mere wave of his hand could crush everything around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, this is Gold Core, huh...?\u201d he murmured. He could clearly sense that the nine spiritual seas inside of him were gone, and had been replaced by a spinning Gold Core!</p><br/><p>This was true Heaven-Dao Gold Core!</p><br/><p>Every time the Gold Core spun, it released more power than the last time. As the cultivation base power poured through him, his body underwent a heaven-shaking, earth-toppling transformation.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just an addition to his longevity; he was ascending to a higher form of life. Everything around him now looked different than before.</p><br/><p>There were more colors, everything was more crisp and detailed, and he seemed closer to everything!!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, a Heaven-Dao aura erupted out from him that far surpassed the aura from his days in Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment. It connected him to heaven and earth in such a way that he almost felt as if he had the power to summon heavenly lightning!</p><br/><p>There was another indescribable feeling that existed inside of him, something like what he had experienced in the world of the Blood Ancestor. It was almost as if he were being doted upon by heaven and earth; when he looked up into the sky, it seemed strangely familiar to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cGold Core!!\u201d Clenching his hands into fists, he threw his head back and let loose a long cry. Everything around him shook, and the cultivators of the River-Defying Sect began to cheer even more loudly than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cI think I can keep going!\u201d he thought. Taking a deep breath, he sent his Undying Live Forever Technique into motion. Shockingly, an asura appeared behind him, then a second, a third, and a fourth....</p><br/><p>One asura after another appeared, causing his energy to skyrocket. By this point, he was already far beyond the ordinary early Core Formation level. Everyone, especially the Chosen, were completely shocked.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s... he's going to keep going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this possible?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s fleshly body power. Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s going to form a fleshly body Gold Core?!?!\u201d Numerous onlookers were crying out in shock.</p><br/><p>Stepping into Core Formation in the middle of a battlefield was a shocking thing in and of itself. But then he actually reached Heaven-Dao Gold Core, and after that, continued to increase his fleshly body power. The cultivators of both the River-Defying Sect and the Sky River Court were so shocked that they were going into a daze.</p><br/><p>Even as they went silent, a fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, and finally, a ninth asura appeared behind him. Rumbling sounds filled heaven and earth as the energy of nine asuras caused everything to shake violently.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s breakthrough was not limited to his cultivation base; he was actually making progress with his Undying Asura Body!</p><br/><p>The nine asuras were like nine Dharma Idols, surrounding Bai Xiaochun and roaring into the heavens just like he was.</p><br/><p>It was a sound that surpassed heavenly thunder, and caused everyone to be shaken to the core. Even the plants in the jungle were trembling, and all Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, and ordinary Core Formation cultivators felt their cultivation bases teetering unstably.</p><br/><p>Gasps and cries of astonishment could be heard everywhere!</p><br/><p>But then, a tenth asura appeared next to the ninth one, and a massive tremor ran through Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>It was in that moment that he could sense a shackle inside of him!!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe five great shackles....\u201d he murmured to himself. He had already broken through the first shackle back when he had mastered the Undying Skin. Now, the second shackle had appeared!</p><br/><p>Although he couldn\u2019t break through it at the moment, he could at least make contact!</p><br/><p>To him, it felt as if four enormous mountains were weighing down onto him. It was something he couldn\u2019t detect before, but now his senses were heightened, and the feeling couldn\u2019t be clearer. He suddenly had the urge to destroy those mountains, to break free and truly rise up!</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm almost at the point of achieving the Undying Heavenly King Body. Once that happens, I can form an Undying Heavenly King Core!\u201d As he thought back to the details of the second volume of the Undying Codex, his eyes shone with anticipation, and his heart thumped with excitement. At that point, he looked down at the young man he had been fighting before, who was now trembling with terror.</p><br/><p>Almost as soon as their gazes met, the Heaven-Dao aura vanished, and the pressure faded away.</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s hair began to stand on end, and he started to back up. He really had no choice other than to give up on the fight; as of this moment, Bai Xiaochun filled him with indescribable terror.</p><br/><p>The fact that Bai Xiaochun was looking directly at him caused his heart to pound wildly. That gaze was like two sharp swords stabbing into his heart and mind, causing his Earth Core to shake.</p><br/><p>In the same moment that the young man turned to flee, several streams of divine sense, as well as a group of cultivators, began to race toward him from the Sky River Court to save him. However, Bai Xiaochun was much closer to him than they were. He already had shocking speed back in Foundation Establishment, and now that he was in Heaven-Dao Gold Core, he was even faster!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting away!\u201d he said, his voice as cold as ice. The young man had forced him to make the dangerous and potentially deadly choice of forcing Core Formation early. As a result, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s killing intent surged with complete intensity.</p><br/><p>He took a step forward, and wings sprouted behind him. The Mountain Shaking Bash gave him an explosive burst of speed, causing him to leave behind afterimages and a series of sonic booms. In the blink of an eye, he was right in front of the young Core Formation cultivator!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou just hit me with a palm strike. Now it\u2019s my turn!\u201d His voice echoed out like the winter wind as he reached his hand back and then sent his palm flying toward the young man.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

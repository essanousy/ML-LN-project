You only have a trifling early Celestial Realm cultivation base, and yet you dare to cause problems for me?!\u201d Snorting coldly, Bai Xiaochun shot northward in a beam of prismatic light.</p><br/><p>Back in Mistysea City, the Grand Heavenmaster, the Giant Ghost King and Zhou Yixing emerged only in time to see him disappearing off into the distance. All of them exchanged awkward glances.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026 was that <em>our</em> celestial\u2026?\u201d Zhou Yixing asked. \u201cBai Xiaochun?\u201d He truly could not remember a time when he had seen Bai Xiaochun act in a domineering fashion like this.</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghost King looked equally suspicious, and actually knew more about him than most. For example, back in the Ghost King Orchid incident, Bai Xiaochun had seemed like he would have done anything to avoid going to to the trial by fire. Back then, the Giant Ghost King had assumed Bai Xiaochun had been trying to fish for greater rewards before going. Only later did he realize that Bai Xiaochun was just simply petrified of death.</p><br/><p>If there was even a hint of danger involved in some activity, he would refuse to participate. In most situations, he would only go into danger as a last resort.</p><br/><p>In this situation, Celestial Deadfall\u2019s actions were a bit excessive, but it wasn\u2019t as if the situation couldn\u2019t be resolved. There wasn\u2019t necessarily a need to resort to violence. Therefore, the Giant Ghost King was truly confused about what was going on.</p><br/><p>The Grand Heavenmaster was equally befuddled. The three of them exchanged another glance, and clearly, all of them felt that Bai Xiaochun was acting strange.</p><br/><p>\u201cUh\u2026.\u201d The Grand Heavenmaster was usually a quick thinker, but not even he was sure about what was happening. After a bit of time passed, the Giant Ghost King, who of course was Bai Xiaochun\u2019s father-in-law, and understood him the best, slapped his thigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know! Bai Xiaochun achieved a cultivation base breakthrough. His aura was much stronger than before. He must have acquired some sort of good fortune that he took advantage of in his latest session of meditation. The process of going from extreme obesity back to his normal self actually improved his cultivation base!\u201d</p><br/><p>Both Zhou Yixing and the Grand Heavenmaster seemed surprised by this, but after some thought, they realized that it explained everything.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf that\u2019s true, then given Bai Xiaochun\u2019s personality\u2026.\u201d Both Zhou Yixing and the Grand Heavenmaster weren\u2019t sure whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>Even as they sighed awkwardly, Bai Xiaochun was flying through the air feeling very pleased with himself. He accelerated with every moment that passed, surging with confidence, as well as the desire to do battle.</p><br/><p>He had been waiting for this day for some time. Before, when he was in the early Celestial Realm, he had always been forced to slink around with his tail between his legs, and rely on the Greatsword of the North to make himself seem threatening.</p><br/><p>But now that he had broken through to the mid Celestial Realm, he would still need to be cautious in general, but was not worried at all about someone in the early Celestial Realm. After all, with the Greatsword of the North on his side, it would be like a Foundation Establishment expert fighting a Qi Condensation cultivator.</p><br/><p>From a distance, he looked like a shooting star piercing through the sky, causing rumbling sounds to fill heaven and earth.</p><br/><p>The ground even quaked because of his passage, and sonic booms echoed out ceaselessly. Furthermore, his passage caused the clouds to seethe and wrap around him almost like a cloak!</p><br/><p>It was a cloak that ran 5,000 kilometers from end to end and obscured the pre-evening light, creating something like a huge shadow.</p><br/><p>Down below, the northern cultivators were all shocked by what they saw. Regardless of the level of their cultivation base, even experts in the great circle of the Demigod Realm all gasped and looked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s King Heavenspan!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! What\u2019s happening? Don\u2019t tell me war is breaking out!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt must be those orders from Celestial Deadfall to arrest all of the people of Heavenspan! King Heavenspan must be here with deadly intentions!\u201d</p><br/><p>As countless gasps could be heard down below, Bai Xiaochun accelerated, passing mountain ranges and plains until he was closing in on the largest city in this region!</p><br/><p>Celestial Deadfall\u2019s official mansion was very different from Gongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s temporary palace of operations. It was an enormous statue of a fierce avian beast with wide-spread wings and glaring eyes. The creature\u2019s mouth was open, making it seem almost like it was letting out a heaven-shaking cry.</p><br/><p>Different celestials had different blessed lands that they called their own, and when they were assigned to oversee a specific area, they would often move their blessed land to the new location by means of magical techniques.</p><br/><p>Celestial Deadfall was currently seated cross-legged in his blessed land. He looked middle-aged, which meant that he looked younger than the average celestial. However, the Willpower fluctuations rolling off of him were by no means weak. Even though he was only in the early Celestial Realm, he was still an outstanding and powerful individual, roughly equivalent to Ghostmother.</p><br/><p>He was skinny, with a long, hooked nose and very thin lips. He was clearly a harsh individual, his expression gloomy and cold. As soon as he sensed Bai Xiaochun arriving, his eyes snapped open, revealing bright blue eyes.</p><br/><p>There was something about his blue eyes that made him seem particularly dashing, the type who would immediately attract the gazes of any females in the area.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat's with the hysterics!?\u201d he growled. Snorting coldly, he prepared to rise to his feet when, all of a sudden, a thunderous voice filled the air.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeadfall, you fool, how dare you try to extort me!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was still a great distance away, but his voice still slammed into the enormous avian statue belonging to Celestial Deadfall.</p><br/><p>At that point, Bai Xiaochun accelerated to a speed ten times greater than before!!</p><br/><p>In the past, Bai Xiaochun had clearly been in the early Celestial Realm. But now, he went all out with his mid Celestial Realm cultivation base. It only took a short moment for him to be right there at Celestial Deadfall\u2019s blessed land. The instant he arrived, he reached out with his right hand and slapped the statue!</p><br/><p>A huge boom echoed out, filling all the lands around it. Shockingly, many cultivators in the second immortal domain subconsciously reached out with their own right hands and mimicked Bai Xiaochun\u2019s movement!</p><br/><p>This was none other than\u2026 Willpower magic!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun might not seem like much when he chose to hold back. But now that he was making a move, he immediately used his Willpower. As a result, an enormous hand appeared in the sky, which rumbled toward the statue and immediately crushed all of its powerful defensive magics and other protections, causing it to start to fall to pieces.</p><br/><p>Shock gripped the mind of Celestial Deadfall, who let out an angry shout as he unleashed the power of his early Celestial Realm cultivation base. When Bai Xiaochun saw that he was preparing to fight back, he snorted coldly. There was no way he was going to give the man a chance to start a true fight. He would crush him right from the beginning!</p><br/><p>Just as Celestial Deadfall prepared to shoot out from the crumbling statue, Bai Xiaochun waved his hand, producing the Greatsword of the North. Blue light shone off of it in scintillating fashion, along with the powerful ripples of a world treasure. Not hesitating for a moment, he slashed the sword at the statue!</p><br/><p>\u201cDeadfall, ya punk, you\u2019ve got real guts to go and provoke me!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was particularly proud of these words, and felt them to be quite impressive. Meanwhile, the huge sword was now descending onto the statue.</p><br/><p>The statue, which had been in the middle of crumbling, suddenly exploded, sending fragments and rubble out in all directions to reveal the shocked Celestial Deadfall, right in the middle of it all.</p><br/><p>His hair was disheveled, and blood oozed out of the corners of his mouth. His hands were splayed out in front of him, and he thrummed with the Willpower he had just used to defend himself. The expression of shock on his face was almost impossible to describe.</p><br/><p>\u201cMid Celestial Realm?! How is this possible?!?!?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

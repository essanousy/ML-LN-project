As for Zhou Yixing, he immediately caught sight of both Bai Xiaochun\u2026 and Bai Hao!</p><br/><p>In that instant, Zhou Yixing\u2019s heart leapt. He knew exactly who Bai Hao was; he was a figure of unparalleled power and importance in the Wildlands.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, Bai Hao really is the Hell-Emperor\u2026. And milord really is his Master!\u201d Although he had speculated all of these things before, to see it confirmed with his own eyes caused his heart to tremble with shock.</p><br/><p>Normally speaking, he would never be able to even enter the presence of someone as important as the Hell-Emperor. Trembling, he hurried forward toward the two. However, he didn't forget the relationship between Bai Xiaochun and Bai Hao. The first person he offered formal greetings to was Bai Xiaochun, and after that, Bai Hao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYixing offers greetings, milord! Greetings, exalted Hell-Emperor!\u201d He ducked his head nervously, unable to conceal his excitement.</p><br/><p>Zhou Yixing\u2019s respectful and excited attitude was quite pleasing to Bai Xiaochun. Although he couldn\u2019t go and tell everyone how important he was now, to be so adored by people close to him was good enough.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about my Que\u2019er?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid you bring him along too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, he couldn\u2019t wait to see how Song Que would react upon finding out who he was.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Hao, a strange expression could be seen on his face. However, he understood his Master well, and cooperated in full, allowing the impressive aura of the Hell-Emperor to erupt out in full force. Zhou Yixing gasped, his respect deepening as he quickly pulled Song Que out of his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>Song Que had only been in the bag of holding for a few days, so when he came out, he wasn\u2019t gasping for breath like he often had in the past. He had grown used to spending time inside bags of holding, and actually liked it to some degree. Besides, considering all of the cultivation resources he had benefited from, all traces of his previous ordeal were gone, and his cultivation base had even made progress. He was now very close to the mid Nascent Soul stage.</p><br/><p>As soon as he was out in the open, he plastered an expression of respect onto his face, laying eyes, not on Bai Xiaochun, but Bai Hao.</p><br/><p>He was aware of the fact that Bai Hao had become the Hell-Emperor, and it filled his heart with excitement. However, it was at this point that he noticed a familiar face next to Bai Hao.</p><br/><p>His eyes widened, and he even wondered if he was seeing things. When he looked closer, he began to tremble, and then slowly reached out and pointed at Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Zhou Yixing remained off to the side in silent introspection, not daring to interfere with this reunion. As for Bai Hao, his expression grew more awkward. However, he knew that Bai Xiaochun was obviously relishing this moment, and therefore, he held back from saying anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026.\u201d Song Que breathed. He really had not expected to see Bai Xiaochun here; it was so unexpected that it threw his mind into chaos. In fact, because of that, he didn\u2019t notice at all how Zhou Yixing and Bai Hao were reacting.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat, smiled, and said, \u201cHi, Que\u2019er!\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside, he was feeling incomparably wonderful.</p><br/><p>As soon as Song Que heard himself being called Que\u2019er, he was pushed to the point of exploding. However, after everything he had experienced in the Wildlands, he felt as if he had grown up quite a bit. Therefore, he suppressed his displeasure and, brimming with confidence, he yelled, \u201cHow dare you show up here in the Hell-Emperor\u2019s presence!\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, he and Bai Xiaochun were both fellow disciples of the River-Defying Sect. Although he was not very happy to see him, and in fact didn\u2019t even speak his name, he at least decided to vaguely point out that Bai Hao was the Hell-Emperor.</p><br/><p>\u201cI gave him his chance,\u201d he thought. \u201cIf he\u2019s smart, he\u2019ll flee immediately, or at least figure out a way to resolve the situation. If not, then he\u2019ll be dead, and it won\u2019t be my fault.\u201d With that, he simply stared at Bai Xiaochun, inwardly shaking his head at how the two of them now existed on totally different levels.</p><br/><p>The fact that he had come to be the Hell-Emperor\u2019s pet gave him a status that Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t even compare to. In fact, it was highly likely that he would soon have the chance to crush Bai Xiaochun underfoot, just like he'd always wanted to.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just fate,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cBai Xiaochun, ah, Bai Xiaochun. You\u2019re just unlucky. You never managed to be anything more than a fugitive in the Wildlands, with everyone running around trying to kill you. As for me, I managed to become the pet of the Hell-Emperor! Considering my important position, I'm more powerful than you can even imagine.\u201d A look of pity appeared in Song Que\u2019s eyes as he looked down his nose at Bai Xiaochun. Then he sighed inwardly. Considering their past, he knew that if he could manage to save Bai Xiaochun, he probably should. After all, they were both from the River-Defying Sect.</p><br/><p>It was roughly at this point that, all of a sudden, he began to wonder why it was that Bai Xiaochun was right here in Bai Hao\u2019s presence, and that there didn\u2019t seem to be any conflicts or tension. Just when he was about to ponder the subject, Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat. By this point, Bai Xiaochun could tell based on what he knew about Song Que that he wasn\u2019t going to try to do anything villainous.</p><br/><p>Considering that, his impression of Song Que improved. Furthermore, considering that they were at a critical moment, and that he was Song Que\u2019s uncle, he suddenly felt a bit protective.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, whatever,\u201d he thought. \u201cI guess I can do without his respect.\u201d Feeling very much like he was acting in the best interests of his nephew, he glanced at Bai Hao and then pointed at Zhou Yixing.</p><br/><p>\u201cHao\u2019er, this Zhou Yixing has been my follower for years. He was always there to support me, and did many things for me. Since I'm leaving, I hope that you can accept him as a follower.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Zhou Yixing heard that, it was like music to his ears. His heart trembled with joy, and he felt like he had been struck with the greatest luck in the world. Profound gratitude welled up in his heart, to the point where his knees began to shake.</p><br/><p>\u201cMilord\u2026 many thanks! Many thanks, milord!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a true Wildlander necromancer, and therefore, felt complete adoration and fervor for the Hell-Emperor, more so than Bai Xiaochun would ever be able to comprehend. Therefore, when he heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words, he simply couldn\u2019t remain calm.</p><br/><p>He knew that if he worked for the Hell-Emperor, he would essentially be like an emissary in the world of the living. It was an extremely high honor that would put him very close to the level of the four heavenly kings.</p><br/><p>In fact, from now on, his clan would never again dare to treat him as the crown prince of the clan. That title wouldn\u2019t befit someone of his standing.</p><br/><p>He would be the person his clan relied on, both patriarchs and ordinary clan members alike! Everyone would treat him with the utmost respect!</p><br/><p>As Zhou Yixing went wild with joy, Song Que stared with eyes as wide as saucers. In that moment, his confidence and arrogance all faltered, and he suddenly felt like he might collapse mentally. A sensation of disbelief rose up in his heart, and he actually began to wonder if he was hallucinating\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you\u2026 just call the Hell-Emperor <em>Hao\u2019er</em>?!\u201d he asked. Then turned from Bai Xiaochun to look at Zhou Yixing. \u201cAnd did you\u2026 just call him <em>milord</em>?!</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this some sort of mistake? This\u2026 this seems off\u2026.\u201d He drifted off into speechlessness, grabbing his head in his hands to stop it from spinning. He was feeling so profoundly and utterly shaken that he could hardly take it.</p><br/><p>Startled, and a bit worried, Bai Xiaochun realized that this was clearly a huge blow to Song Que, and quickly tried to come up with a way to explain the situation.</p><br/><p>Despite how excited Zhou Yixing was, Song Que\u2019s words caused a strange expression to appear on his face. Sighing inwardly, he suddenly felt very sorry for Song Que\u2026.</p><br/><p>Bai Hao felt the same. However, he smiled wryly, turned to Bai Xiaochun, and offered formal greetings with clasped hands.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrders received, Master!\u201d When it came to who was his emissary in the world of the living, if anyone else had provided the suggestion, Bai Hao would have put a lot of thought into the matter. But since Bai Xiaochun had suggested it be Zhou Yixing, he didn\u2019t bother to worry about it.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he accepted the instructions from Bai Xiaochun in the same way that he always had in the past. And his response struck Song Que like zillions of lightning bolts!</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you\u2026 just call him <em>Master</em>?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

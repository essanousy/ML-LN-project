Instead, they were ordered to stay behind the shield.</p><br/><p>In fact, as the shield retreated, they retreated!</p><br/><p>The only fighting that went on was with any necromancers who were able to pierce through the shield itself!</p><br/><p>As of this moment, the battle seemed somewhat lopsided. Countless savage giants roared forth to attack the shield, which was slowly being pushed back across the battlefield.</p><br/><p>The cultivators of the five legions were pulling back until the point that they were in the shadow of the wall itself. Anxiety was mounting among the soldiers, and yet the eyes of Bai Lin and the other four generals glittered brightly, as though they were waiting for just the right moment to order a counter attack.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd that should do it....\u201d Bai Lin murmured, looking both edgy and eager at the same time.</p><br/><p>Even as the cultivators continued to fall back, the huge eye atop the pagoda in the middle of the city suddenly flared to life, revealing the image of a bat!</p><br/><p>Instantly, cold-blooded laughter pierced into the ears of everyone present as the bat opened its mouth and then spit out a stream of vengeful souls!</p><br/><p>1 soul. 10 souls. 1,000 souls. 10,000 souls. Soon, it was almost impossible to count how many souls were pouring madly out of the bat's mouth. The bat was like a bottomless pit; within the blink of an eye, more than 100,000,000 souls could be seen flying out of Great Wall City and through the shield toward the massive army of giants!</p><br/><p>And things weren\u2019t over yet. The souls continued to pour out. 100,000,000. 200,000,000. 300,000,000. Within mere moments, there were fully 500,000,000!!</p><br/><p>The cultivators of the five legions looked on, eyes wide with disbelief. The Wildlanders were even more incredulous.</p><br/><p>Savage giants, soul cultivators, and necromancers alike reacted with complete shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-this... this....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! I can\u2019t believe there are so many vengeful souls! Aren\u2019t we the ones who fight with vengeful souls? How can the Great Wall have so many of them!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if they saved up for a very, very long time, it would still be very difficult to get that many!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As rumbling sounds rose up into the sky, the Wildlanders looked on in disbelief. What was happening was so shocking they felt like their world had been turned upside down. After all, they were usually the ones who drove the vengeful souls into attacking the Great Wall.</p><br/><p>And yet now, everything had been turned around. The Great Wall was sending the vengeful souls charging in attack against them!</p><br/><p>Even more outrageous was that there were 500,000,000 of them. That was more than had been used by the Wildlands in the previous major battle. The sight of the seemingly endless group of vengeful souls rushing toward them caused the Wildlands savages to tremble in shock and terror.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the 500,000,000 souls fell upon the savage giants, whom they bored into, provoking agonized shrieks before causing their bodies to explode.</p><br/><p>Such explosions did not merely occur here and there. Within a few short breaths of time, tens upon tens of thousands of giants exploded, causing a mist of blood to build up on the battlefield.</p><br/><p>As the souls charged forth, the huge army of giants began to fall apart, and the previously lopsided state of affairs changed.</p><br/><p>Almost instantly, chaos prevailed, and no matter what the soul cultivators did to try to keep the giants under control, nothing worked. Even the necromancers\u2019 eyes were bright red as they drew deeply upon their own powers to try to take control of the souls. However, there were simply too many of them, making such efforts totally futile.</p><br/><p>Most important was that the huge bat in the eye was continuing to spit out souls, creating a tide that crushed everything in its path like a boulder crushing a drinking glass.</p><br/><p>The cultivators of the five legions were extremely excited, and as their blood boiled, they began to cry out at the tops of their lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are the souls Bai Xiaochun handed over!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it now! Those are Major General Bai\u2019s souls!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! This is unheard-of. This is the first time the grand forces of the Great Wall have sent vengeful souls to attack the Wildlands!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>At the same time, Bai Lin and the other generals threw their heads back and laughed uproariously. This was the moment they had been waiting for!</p><br/><p>\u201cSkin Flayers,\u201d Bai Lin roared, \u201cfollow me into battle!!\u201d Howling with laughter, he charged forward across the battlefield, the Skin Flayers following along behind him.</p><br/><p>The other four legions similarly advanced into battle, and within moments, the five legions were cutting through the enemy like sharp blades. With the savages in chaos and the vengeful souls providing cover, they emerged from behind the shield to unleash slaughter.</p><br/><p>As for the spell formation shield, it flickered with bright light, and then, instead of pulling back, began to push forward, completely uninhibited.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201d someone screamed in a voice replete with hatred and murder. It was none other than Mistress Red-Dust, who was in the middle of fighting back and forth with Chen Hetian.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t the only one to put the pieces of the puzzle together. As the giants suffered defeat after defeat on the front lines, they heard the exclamations of the five legions, and soon realized that Devil Bai was to blame. Then, countless roars of rage and howled curses could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Wildlands\u2019 humiliation will never go away unless Devil Bai is killed!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDevil Bai, our Holy People won\u2019t rest until you\u2019re dead!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you fall into my hands, Bai Xiaochun, I\u2019ll make you suffer for a thousand years!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as words such as these began to echo out across the battlefield, Bai Xiaochun and his five regiments stepped onto the wall itself. Immediately, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s jaw dropped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did I do this time?\u201d Then he saw the countless vengeful souls smashing into the Wildlands army, and rubbed his eyes a bit before looking out again to make sure he wasn\u2019t seeing things.</p><br/><p>The 5,000 cultivators he led looked out at the battlefield, and then glanced over at Bai Xiaochun, odd expressions on their faces. Master God-Diviner was completely shaken, and although he wasn\u2019t sure exactly what was going on, he could hear what the savage giants were screaming about. Looking over at Bai Xiaochun, he felt his scalp prickling in shock, and even trembled from the feelings of reverence that rose up within him.</p><br/><p>\u201cSure enough, the junior patriarch is completely extraordinary. Not only did he already become a major general, but he somehow got the Wildlands to hate him down to the core of their being!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heretic was as stunned into silence, as if he had been physically struck.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was feeling quite anxious due to the unimaginable events which were playing out. He turned his head to look up at the bat in the huge eye, and then back out at all the eyes on the battlefield staring at him, and then his eyes glittered. All of a sudden, he was struck with the realization that this was a perfect situation to show off a bit. Sticking his chest out, he looked down his nose at the battlefield.</p><br/><p>Clasping his hands behind his back, he coolly said, \u201cTrifling savages. I can reduce the lot of you into ashes without even stepping foot onto the battlefield!\u201d</p><br/><p>In response, the savages cursed, and the five legions cheered. As of this moment, Bai Xiaochun felt more important than heaven or earth.</p><br/><p>However, it was also in that moment that Mistress Red-Dust turned to glare at him with gritted teeth. The last major battle had been a defeat for the Wildlands because of Bai Xiaochun, and now the same thing was happening with this battle. Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s desire to kill Bai Xiaochun surged more powerfully than ever.</p><br/><p>However, with Chen Hetian there blocking her path, there was nothing she could do to Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Therefore, she raised her voice and said, \u201cWildlanders, hear my orders! I hereby call upon my authority as Mistress Red-Dust to place Bai Xiaochun in 1st place on the Execution List, and also increase the reward on his head!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat reward is now a full set of five elements deva beast souls!!! The bounty is good throughout all creation, and is available to both members of our Holy People and cultivators from the Great Wall. The only requirement is to kill Bai Xiaochun! I, Red-Dust, swear an oath upon my cultivation base, and vow to never break my word in the slightest aspect. Furthermore, I will not reveal the identity of the person who kills him, nor divulge even the slightest bit of information about them. If I violate any aspect of this oath, let my cultivation base be ruined and my life destroyed in body and soul!\u201d As Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s piercing words rang out, thunder rumbled up in the heavens, as if to bear witness to her promise. That in itself indicated that Mistress Red-Dust had just uttered a Dao oath!</p><br/><p>When a Dao oath was uttered, it could not be violated!!</p><br/><p>As her words echoed back and forth, the entire battlefield went quiet, and countless eyes turned to fall upon Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Such gazes didn\u2019t just come from the Wildlands forces, but also from cultivators of the five legions!</p><br/><p>The reward which had just been proclaimed was simply too dramatic!! A complete set of five elements deva beast souls was equivalent to a deva soul, and their value to someone who wanted to step into the Nascent Soul stage was beyond description!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, Mistress Red-Dust had promised not to divulge any information about the person who killed Bai Xiaochun. Because of that, many hearts began to race with excitement.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun saw so many murderous and greedy gazes falling upon him, his expression flickered, and he even started shaking. Without even thinking about it, he slapped his bag of holding, causing more layers of armor to build up around him. Suddenly, he had no desire to try to show off, and instead, had a very bad feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey this wasn\u2019t my fault!\u201d he muttered, feeling very wronged. \u201cWho would have known that bat would spit all those souls out...?\u201d The unexpected calamity not only had him feeling very nervous, but he was also filled with regret. It felt like a cold wind was creeping up his back as he suddenly realized that his poor little life was now being threatened.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is completely unfair!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Apparently, the creature had learned from its previous mistake, and instead of reaching out with its claws first, its head appeared, crocodilian and fierce to the extreme, with rows of sharp teeth as large as mountains.</p><br/><p>Filling nearly half the sky, it lunged toward the face of nirvanic extermination.</p><br/><p>It was so huge that just its head filled half the sky, and thus, it could only be imagined how large its body was. Clearly, the Eternal Immortal Domains couldn\u2019t even sustain such a large entity.</p><br/><p>Mortals usually think that things which are large in size are particularly powerful. But cultivators view things differently, and are impressed by large things only when they reach a certain, completely exaggerated level. And right now\u2026 all the cultivators who could see this head were shivering in terror.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s life essence spirit\u2026 was just ridiculously massive!</p><br/><p>The truth was that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Waterswamp Kingdom had grown with him as his cultivation base advanced.</p><br/><p>Earlier, he had used the technique inside the body of the Mortal Renegade, where no one could see it. But right now, numerous gasps could be heard as people finally caught sight of it with their own eyes. That was especially true of the disciples from the former Spirit Stream Sect.</p><br/><p>Li Qinghou\u2019s jaw dropped, and Patriarch Spirit Stream stared in shock. After all, even though the Waterswamp Kingdom was difficult to cultivate, there had been people who had succeeded with it throughout history. And yet, compared to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Waterswamp Kingdom, all of those previous versions seemed like knock-offs.</p><br/><p>In fact, the people from the Spirit Stream Sect even began to wonder if the divine ability from their sect had been the real thing\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 the Waterswamp Kingdom?\u201d Even Bai Xiaochun\u2019s family was shocked. Song Junwan gasped, and both Dabao and Xiaoxiao were visibly stunned by the enormous, vicious crocodilian head.</p><br/><p>As everyone looked on, stunned, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s life essence spirit snapped up the face of nirvanic extermination. But then, apparently not satisfied, it unhesitatingly shot toward the Mortal Renegade.</p><br/><p>Not even Daoist Heavenspan could keep himself from feeling shocked by what he was seeing. Eyes nearly popping out of his skull, he blurted, \u201cWhat is that thing!?!?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Daoist Heavenspan\u2019s scalp was tingling on the verge of exploding; this was the first time since he became an apprentice of the Mortal Renegade that he had felt so shaken. In fact, a sensation of deadly crisis had already gripped his heart.</p><br/><p>Not daring to hesitate, he backed up as if he planned to go back into the Mortal Renegade\u2019s forehead. Unfortunately for him, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s life essence spirit was too fast, and blocked his path.</p><br/><p>Defiance rose up in Daoist Heavenspan as a feeling of impending death overtook him. To him, it felt like he had been involved in a sword fight, only to have his opponent throw down his sword and then pull out a mountain to crush him with.</p><br/><p>The life essence spirit was like heaven and earth, and Daoist Heavenspan was like an ant\u2026.</p><br/><p>The Mortal Renegade\u2019s head was actually much larger than the life essence spirit, and yet, it ravenously opened its jaws as if to take a bite.</p><br/><p>The people of the Eternal Immortal Domains were as stunned as wooden chickens, and even Bai Xiaochun was sweating nervously. He was almost considering calling his life essence spirit back, but it was too late. Before he could do anything, the creature bit down onto the Mortal Renegade.</p><br/><p>A crunching sound rang out\u2026 which was like an explosion that caused all heaven and earth to distort. Then, a bloodcurdling scream erupted from Bai Xiaochun\u2019s life essence spirit, and a few of its mountain-like teeth fell out\u2026.</p><br/><p>However, the life essence spirit apparently did get a chunk of rock-like flesh, whereupon it lunged back into the swamp and disappeared\u2026.</p><br/><p>The people of the Eternal Immortal Domains looked on in shock, and Daoist Heavenspan glanced around, apparently surprised to still be alive. Sweat dripping down his face, he shot into the Mortal Renegade\u2019s forehead, not even looking over his shoulder.</p><br/><p>As for the Mortal Renegade, two enormous teeth were still stuck into his face, surrounded by numerous cracks and crevices. It was a really odd sight\u2026.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. Even in a somber and dramatic fight like this, he was still able to do what he usually did, and make things amusing\u2026.</p><br/><p>Although Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t happy that Daoist Heavenspan had escaped, the look of stupefaction on his face had been worth it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe ran too quickly this time, that\u2019s all!\u201d Snorting coldly, he waved his right hand, and the spell formation of the Essence of time began to form together again. As for the shocked cultivators down below, they all went back to their work from moments before.</p><br/><p>This time, Daoist Heavenspan didn\u2019t interfere\u2026.</p><br/><p>As starlight streamed up from below, the huge spell formation formed around the Mortal Renegade. As it completed, the Essence of time swirled, forming something like an enormous vortex.</p><br/><p>It was a vortex of innumerable stars, each of which was part of the spell formation. Within it was the power of Essence, which caused all of the time in the area to slow down.</p><br/><p>And that was the main purpose of the formation. Not only would it slow down time to prevent the seal from unravelling too soon, but it would buy them time in general.</p><br/><p>Now that the spell formation was operational, Bai Xiaochun breathed a sigh of relief. At that point, he looked at the Mortal Renegade\u2019s forehead, and then\u2026 the teeth sticking into his face. It was a strange thing. Why did the teeth remain after the life essence spirit vanished? Contemplating the matter, he headed back down to the Eternal Immortal Domains.</p><br/><p>Upon arriving in Arch-Emperor City, some of his subordinates delivered the teeth that had fallen from his life essence spirit. Ignoring the strange looks on the faces of his subordinates, he studied the teeth for a while before putting them into his bag of holding. After all, if his life essence spirit showed up next time missing a bunch of teeth\u2026 it would look really ugly.</p><br/><p>Sighing, Bai Xiaochun once again wondered why things always got strange around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was obviously a very serious situation!\u201d Scratching his head, he put the matter aside and went to find his Daoist partners.</p><br/><p>After all, his Waterswamp Kingdom had eased some of the tension, but that didn\u2019t change the potential for impending destruction of a cataclysmic nature.</p><br/><p>The Saint-Emperor becoming a half-sovereign wasn\u2019t the answer to the problem. Everything would come down to Bai Xiaochun, and whether or not he could succeed.</p><br/><p>Right now, he needed to go into secluded meditation, and for how long, no one knew!</p><br/><p>When he came out, it could be right into a deadly situation. It was impossible to say what things would be like. Therefore, the only thing he could think to do now was send his friends and family to the treasured fan, where they could hopefully remain safe.</p><br/><p>However, whether it was Song Junwan, Zhou Zimo, or Hou Xiaomei, none of them agreed. Neither did Dabao or Xiaoxiao. The Giant Ghost King, Li Qinghou, and everyone else all felt the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would be the point of that?\u201d Song Junwan said softly. \u201cIf the Eternal Immortal Domains go away, do you really think that we can just live on some fan? Like you said, the Mortal Renegade seeks to exterminate all of the starry sky. All people. Maybe we could escape one disaster, but it would only be delaying the inevitable.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

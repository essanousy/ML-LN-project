Upon rematerializing, he held a feather in his hand, which was the reward for passing the sixth level.</p><br/><p>It seemed like nothing more than an ordinary feather, and not even a close examination revealed anything special about it. Bai Xiaochun could only guess that it might be part of some larger construct. Putting it away, he headed to the seventh level.</p><br/><p>The seventh level was much harder than the previous levels. It was a test, not of the cultivation base, but rather intuition. After all, it was impossible to use divine sense here. The entire seventh level was\u2026 a maze.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate mazes\u2026.\u201d he muttered. Two hours later, he found himself teleported back to the square formed by the handle of the fan. He had failed, and currently felt his head swimming from having wandered back and forth in the maze without being able to find the right path.</p><br/><p>As it turned out, there was a time limit to these lower levels. If one spent two hours within a given level without passing it, they would automatically be teleported away.</p><br/><p>There were other devas and demigods who would be teleported out occasionally, most of them having been unable to pass the sixth level. Up to this point, only seven people had made it past the seventh level!</p><br/><p>In addition to Bai Xiaochun and the other celestials, there was only one demigod among that group: Preceptor Seadeep.</p><br/><p>Varied thoughts ran through the heads of the trial-takers.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, this is hard! Especially the sixth level. It's impossible to get past!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThese tests are definitely not designed for devas. The sixth level\u2026 is definitely suitable for celestials only! Maybe a demigod could pass it\u2026 but not many!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to get past it! These rewards are so incredible! Especially the reward for the fifth level. I got a bottle of Meridian-Tempering Serum of peerless quality! Back home, a bottle like that would go for over 10,000 spirit stones!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The cultivators of a given dynasty did not mix with those of the other. However, those of shared origins would gather after failing a level to discuss their results with each other. Up to this point, everyone was still excited about the situation, and didn\u2019t worry too much about failing.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf the reward for the fifth level is Meridian-Tempering Serum, then what do you think the rewards for the sixth and seventh levels will be? Whatever they are\u2026 they\u2019ll probably be more unique and precious than Meridian-Tempering Serum!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe probably don't qualify to even find out. Although, I noticed that Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a seems to be the fastest of us all. He\u2019s already on the tenth level!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I saw him going into the tenth level. So far, the rest of the celestials are in the seventh and eighth levels. Up to now, none of them have come back out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was not very happy about what he was hearing, and also had a bad premonition about what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a going so fast!? With muscles like that, there\u2019s no way he\u2019s very smart. How did he get through the maze?\u201d The more he thought about it, the more he started to suspect what was happening.</p><br/><p>If things kept going this way, it didn\u2019t seem likely that he would be able to compete with Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a. Although he wasn\u2019t quite willing to just give up, in the end, he sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, whatever. It just keeps getting harder the further along you go. And I just became a celestial. He has a lot of experience, so if I can\u2019t beat him, I just won\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019ll go through the levels as best I can. Even if I don't get the fan in the end, I\u2019ll at least get some of the other rewards.\u201d It was in this manner that he tried to convince himself not to worry about the situation. Then he started to try to think of a way to get through the maze.</p><br/><p>However, it was at this very moment that the light of teleportation appeared in both the seventh and eighth levels. When that light reached the square formed by the handle of the fan, Gu Tianjun and Prince Ur-Demon appeared.</p><br/><p>Both of them wore very unsightly expressions as they sat down to think and recover. From what Bai Xiaochun had seen, Gu Tianjun had failed in the eighth level, while Prince Ur-Demon was stuck in the seventh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s something fishy about that eighth level!\u201d he thought. Even as he pondered the situation, other celestials began to be teleported out.</p><br/><p>One of them was Sima Yunhua, who was stuck in the seventh level, and another was Reverend Devourer, who was teleported back from the eighth level.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t dispel his confusion and suspicions. For a moment, he considered going over to Gu Tianjun to ask for some advice, but decided that, considering how much the man didn't like him, it probably wasn\u2019t a good idea.</p><br/><p>At this point, Sima Yunhua gritted his teeth and used some unknown method to communicate with Gu Tianjun and get some information on the seventh level. Afterward, his eyes shone brightly as he headed back into the challenges.</p><br/><p>Prince Ur-Demon did the same thing with Reverend Devourer. After getting the information he needed, he did the same as Sima Yunhua, and headed back into the challenges.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked on anxiously to see what was happening, and was stunned to realize that both parties passed the level in the time it takes half an incense stick to burn. Laughing heartily, they then proceeded on to the next levels.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo fast!?!?\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind raced as he tried to analyze what was going on. Meanwhile, the tenth level suddenly began to shine with bright light.</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, a voice spoke into the minds of all present.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first person to pass the tenth level has acquired Top Contender status, and will henceforth have four hours to pass every level!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the voice faded away, everyone observing on the outside looked around in shock. Meanwhile, the light of teleportation shot out to the square where everyone was standing, and then resolved into the form of Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a.</p><br/><p>As his hulking, tower-like frame came into view, the fan trembled, and the shield protecting the entire area rippled like water.</p><br/><p>Those ripples were caused, not by Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a\u2019s cultivation base, but rather\u2026 because he had gained Top Contender status by passing the tenth level and gaining the approval of the sovereign\u2019s damaged fan!</p><br/><p>What was most shocking, though was that Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a had been given extra time to pass the levels!</p><br/><p>Based on that, it seemed likely that other privileges would be bestowed upon passing the twentieth level, which would make things even easier for Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a. If things kept going like that, then by the time the three months were over, it was highly likely that Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a would become the new owner of the fan!</p><br/><p>If that happened, then not even the Vile-Emperor would be able to take it away from him easily. Perhaps Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a could loan it to him or even sell it, but either way, it was good fortune that would likely give him a chance to become an archaean!</p><br/><p>The crowd knew it, and Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a knew it as well. Inside, he was beaming with joy and excitement, although he didn't let that show on his face. However, there was no question that he was very pleased to have acquired the approval of the fan.</p><br/><p>The prickly feeling in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart grew even stronger at this point. Snorting softly, he prepared to simply look away, and yet, was too slow. All of a sudden, Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a looked over at him with coldly glittering eyes.</p><br/><p>It was impossible to say what exactly he was thinking, but something like the light of augury flickered in his eyes, and he suddenly chuckled.</p><br/><p>Raising his voice, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re stuck at the seventh level, aren\u2019t you Bai Xiaochun? Moron. You\u2019re the only celestial who hasn\u2019t passed it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else was taken aback. After all, this was Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a\u2019s first time returning from the challenges. And yet apparently, he knew how far everyone else had proceeded.</p><br/><p>Even as suspicions arose, Bai Xiaochun looked sharply at Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a, fully aware of the implications of his words.</p><br/><p>Obviously, he had some unknown way of seeing how far everyone else had progressed.</p><br/><p>Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a could tell that Bai Xiaochun was on to him, but merely laughed coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you ask me to hit you earlier, Bai Xiaochun? Don\u2019t worry. As soon as I become the owner of this fan, I\u2019ll be happy to oblige!\u201d With that, he chuckled and sat down cross-legged to do some breathing exercises.</p><br/><p>In the resulting silence, the cultivators from both the Vile-Emperor Dynasty and the Saint-Emperor Dynasty all came to realize that the Top Contender status gave more benefits than merely an extension of time.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiaochun, he was feeling more irritated than ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of legacy is this? He\u2019s obviously cheating! Dammit! There\u2019s nothing I hate more in life than cheaters!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

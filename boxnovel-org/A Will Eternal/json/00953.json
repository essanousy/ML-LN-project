I want to stay\u2026.\u201d However, no matter how hard it struggled, it couldn\u2019t escape from the control of the bone galleon, and was dragged ever upward.</p><br/><p>Soon, the bone lizard was only moments away from entering the vortex. Down below, a look of indescribable longing could be seen on the face of the Celestial.</p><br/><p>In terms of attitude, his was the polar opposite of the laughing-crying ghost face. He had long yearned to be able to reach the peak of the world he lived in, and then step beyond it. However, after all this time, he was still stuck in the same place. It was almost as if he were in a huge prison!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to live in this world. He wanted to leave it. If he forced his way out\u2026 the world would be destroyed, and everyone in it killed. And yet, he still wanted to leave!</p><br/><p>Big Fatty Zhang and the other cultivators stuck on the bone galleon were heading into extreme danger. But for the Celestial, that ship and that vortex represented the future.</p><br/><p>The Celestial burst into motion, becoming a beam of bright light that shot toward the vortex!</p><br/><p>However\u2026 not only did he feel pressure pushing at him from above, but the lands below also tugged him down. It was actually impossible for him to even get close to the vortex!</p><br/><p>In fact, the will of the world which was part of him recognized what he was doing, and began to tremble on the verge of collapse. At that point, a howl of defiant rage escaped the Celestial\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cGravekeeper, you bastard! One of these days\u2026 I <em>will</em> escape this place!!\u201d His words shook the world like heavenly thunder, and even caused lightning bolts to appear in the air around the huge bone lizard.</p><br/><p>A sea of lightning appeared, almost like a huge hand that then grabbed at the lizard.</p><br/><p>The Celestial was using his last bit of power to try to prevent the bone galleon from leaving!</p><br/><p>Tinged with the power of the Heavenspan River, the lightning hand was golden as it closed in on the bone lizard.</p><br/><p>However, before the hand could actually touch the lizard, Ghostmother chuckled coldly and performed a double-handed incantation gesture. Instantly, black smoke erupted from the lizard and shot toward the golden lightning hand.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds filled the air as the two made contact. Clearly, the lightning hand was no match for the smoke, as it began to tremble and fall to pieces. Before it could be completely destroyed, though, the laughing-crying ghost face suddenly used an unknown technique to change directions and shoot toward the hand.</p><br/><p>This sudden turn of events caught Ghostmother by surprise, and a murderous aura sprang up from her. Even the Celestial was shocked. However, he reacted quickly, and sent the golden hand speeding toward the laughing-crying ghost face!</p><br/><p>A huge boom rang out as the laughing-crying ghost face\u2026 was snatched up by the Celestial\u2019s huge hand.</p><br/><p>Then\u2026 as the hand descended back toward the Celestial, and then opened up, the laughing-crying ghost face was nowhere to be seen\u2026.</p><br/><p>The Celestial stood there, eyes flickering with thought.</p><br/><p>When Ghostmother saw what had occurred, her murderous aura grew even more intense, and yet, she didn\u2019t say anything. Looking back down at the world below one last time, she turned her attention away, and sent the bone lizard into the vortex\u2026.</p><br/><p>However, it was in that moment that something happened that not even the Celestial could ever have predicted. Down in the destroyed bone sea, a figure shot up into the air at high speed!</p><br/><p>It was none other than\u2026 Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>\u201cGhostmother, give Hou Xiaomei and my Eldest Brother back to me!!\u201d He had long since decided to throw caution to the wind; he simply couldn\u2019t stand idly by as Hou Xiaomei and Big Fatty Zhang were taken into that vortex.</p><br/><p>He moved with incredible speed, shooting up toward the disappearing bone lizard. As for the cultivators who remained down below, they looked on with surprise and astonishment.</p><br/><p>The Celestial\u2019s eyes narrowed. From what he could tell, everything that was happening reeked of the gravekeeper\u2019s meddling, and he couldn\u2019t help but be suspicious about why the gravekeeper hadn\u2019t made an appearance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe old ghost\u2019s schemes run too deep\u2026. I refuse to believe that he did all this simply to hurt me. There must be some other goal he's working toward!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ghostmother looked down from the bone lizard at Bai Xiaochun, and could see the bloodshot madness in his eyes. However, it didn\u2019t matter how fast he was going, there was no way for him to catch up to the bone lizard. Before he could even get close, it was in the vortex and fading away!</p><br/><p>In the last moment before it was gone, Ghostmother\u2019s lips moved as she transmitted a message to Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I have an agreement with the gravekeeper. Because of that, I will keep your friends safe. The girl has unique qualities that conform to the techniques I cultivate. I will take her as an apprentice. As for the other cultivators onboard, I will keep them safe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun hovered there in midair, looking powerlessly at the disappearing vortex.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaomei\u2026 Eldest Brother\u2026.\u201d At the moment, he felt completely helpless and lonely.</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought back to the dream Big Fatty Zhang had told him about\u2026. Clearly, his Eldest Brother had anticipated this moment for a long time.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun could only hope\u2026 that Ghostmother was telling the truth\u2026.</p><br/><p>As he grew older, as he advanced his cultivation base and increased his longevity, Bai Xiaochun was coming to realize\u2026 that growing up came with a price.</p><br/><p>This wasn\u2019t his first time feeling it. He had experienced this same sensation often in the past. And it always left him feeling powerless. The only thing he wasn\u2019t sure about was whether to blame himself or the world around him.</p><br/><p>He just wanted to practice cultivation and be happy. He just wanted to live his life and smile and laugh\u2026.</p><br/><p>Pain and bitterness gripped his heart as he wondered if he would ever see Big Fatty Zhang and Hou Xiaomei again\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cHopefully so\u2026.\u201d he murmured to himself. He was so wrapped up in his thoughts that he didn\u2019t notice how, as the vortex vanished and the Deadmire collapsed, the restrictive spells in the area began to unravel.</p><br/><p>There was now nothing in the Deadmire to cause problems for cultivators. Perhaps, after many years passed, the area would return to its normal state\u2026 and people would be able to pass through it freely!</p><br/><p>The Celestial left to chase the laughing-crying ghost face, and didn\u2019t take anyone with him, not even Du Lingfei. Du Lingfei looked up at Bai Xiaochun, mixed emotions visible on her face. She seemed to be in a bleak mood as well, but she managed to take a deep breath, fly up, and grasp Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaochun, don\u2019t be sad\u2026. I'm sure that you\u2019ll see them again one day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked over, and could tell that, as she clasped his hand, she was trying to pass all of the warmth and hope she could into him. After a long moment, he nodded.</p><br/><p>There were less than 200 cultivators left on the shattered bones below. All of them were wounded in one way or another. Even Du Lingfei, despite having been in her father\u2019s bag of holding, had been affected by the battle with Ghostmother and Gongsun Wan\u2019er.</p><br/><p>No one was hurt too badly, but all of them would need time to recover. Soon, the entire group began making their way toward the exit of the Deadmire.</p><br/><p>Not only did they need to get to a place where they could focus on recovering, but they also needed to determine where exactly they were. Whichever branch of the river was nearest, they would make their way to the riversource sect there, and then use teleportation portals to get home.</p><br/><p>They traveled in silence, their hearts heavy. The twin Master Cloud Lightnings, Guru Spirit Immortal and Master Thousand-Ghost were devas, and as such, leaders within the group, but even they were wounded, and were still trembling in shock from everything that had happened. The trial by fire was not at all how anyone had expected it to be. Profound secrets had been laid bare, secrets which surpassed the imaginations of everyone present.</p><br/><p>Eventually, they reached the end of the Deadmire, and found themselves looking at a world of snow and ice. When the twin Master Cloud Lightnings felt the frigid qi in the area, their jaws dropped. They weren\u2019t the only ones. The other cultivators from the north all looked around, eyes sparkling with delight.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe north! We're in the north!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can sense the frigid spiritual energy of the north!!\u201d</p><br/><p>This part of the Deadmire\u2026 was attached to the northern Heavenspan River region!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was still dispirited and downcast. However, it was in that moment that his expression flickered, and he looked down at his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs something wrong?\u201d Du Lingfei asked curiously.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. It\u2019s nothing\u2026.\u201d he replied, avoiding the topic. However, waves of shock were battering his heart. Just now, he had sensed that, within the coffin that Patriarch Spirit Stream had given him, the sleeping baby girl\u2026 had murmured something to him!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe aura of home\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

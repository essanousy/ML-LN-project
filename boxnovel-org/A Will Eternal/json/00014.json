Third Elder Sister?</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>Chen Fei and his friends were always happy to gloat in the misfortune of others. As they watched what was happening to Bai Xiaochun, they couldn\u2019t help but feel as if the grand laws of heaven were truly being enforced implacably. As for the two Outer Sect disciples in charge of the trial by fire, they looked on with hatred, a sensation that no other servant had ever caused them to feel.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t wanna go....\u201d Bai Xiaochun plopped onto the ground and immediately began to wail, his voice filled with such a feeling of being abused that any listener would surely weep.</p><br/><p>Simultaneously, back down on the path, Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei saw Li Qinghou and began to quiver. They quickly bowed their heads to avoid notice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Ninth Junior Brother, it\u2019s not that I refused to save you. Now that the peak lord of Fragrant Cloud Peak has shown up, you have no choice but to suck it up in the Outer Sect....\u201d Big Fatty Zhang heaved continuous sighs in his heart as he hunched his shoulders and tried to inconspicuously scuttle away. However, it was at that point that Li Qinghou\u2019s voice suddenly rang in his ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two are coming along as well.\u201d As soon as Big Fatty Zhang heard the words, a powerful force dragged both him and Third Fatty Hei up into the air. They didn\u2019t even have a chance to grab onto a tree before they were hauled to the top of the mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to go!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang wailed, sounding even more miserable than Bai Xiaochun. \u201cI\u2019d rather die in the Ovens than climb the ladder in the Outer Sect....\u201d He sounded so miserable, in fact, that Bai Xiaochun looked up in surprise and forgot to cry.</p><br/><p>Third Fatty Hei didn\u2019t say anything, but instead looked silently down toward the bottom of the mountain, face a picture of depression and longing.</p><br/><p>When Li Qinghou heard Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s miserable wailing, his face darkened and he said, \u201cShut up!\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, Bai Xiaochun rose to his feet, face solemn as he stood there. Instead of looking sullen like he had before, he was the complete opposite, as if he had suddenly switched faces.</p><br/><p>Big Fatty Zhang stared in shock, and then immediately stood up. Inwardly, he felt as if the persecution he was enduring was like an ocean that threatened to overwhelm him. He just couldn\u2019t figure out why Li Qinghou wouldn\u2019t say anything when Bai Xiaochun wailed, and then yelled at him when he did the same thing.</p><br/><p><span id=\"footnote-ref-67dc\"><span>\u201cZhang Dahai, starting today, you\u2019ll be an Outer Sect disciple of Violet Cauldron Peak!\u00a0</span>[1]</span></p><br/><p><span id=\"footnote-ref-0697\"><span>\u201cChen Qingrou, you\u2019ll be going to Green Crest Peak!\u00a0</span>[2]</span></p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun, you\u2019ll be staying here with me, as an Outer Sect disciple of Fragrant Cloud Peak.\u201d Li Qinghou looked at Bai Xiaochun and felt a headache coming on. He had just gone into secluded meditation when he got the news about the Ovens crew and everything that was going on. Even the sect elders were talking about it. Of course, from their perspective, the whole thing was quite amusing, and a nice break from the monotony of cultivation. None of them were even inclined to dole out any punishment.</p><br/><p>However, it wasn\u2019t something that could be allowed to go on indefinitely, so Li Qinghou came to straighten matters out.</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he flicked his sleeve, ignoring Chen Fei and the other two men as he looked at something further up on Fragrant Cloud Peak.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun sighed bitterly and said his goodbyes to Big Fatty Zhang and Third Fatty Hei. All of a sudden, he remembered something. He turned his head to look at Third Fatty Hei, a strange expression on his face as he asked, \u201cThird Elder Brother, your name... is actually Chen Qingrou? Hahaha! What a good name. It makes you sound like a smoking hot babe!\u201d</p><br/><p>Third Fatty Hei gave a cold but depressed snort, then turned and began to walk down the mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with him?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked, looking at Big Fatty Zhang.</p><br/><p>Big Fatty Zhang looked back at him with a strange look in his eyes. Then, he clapped him on the shoulder and spoke, his voice solemn and sincere.</p><br/><p>\u201cNinth Junior Brother, there\u2019s something I never told you before. Third Fatty Hei actually isn\u2019t your Elder Brother. In fact... she's your Elder Sister.\u201d Clearing his throat, he turned and hurried off.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun stared at him blankly. It felt like thunder was crashing around inside his head, as if the whole world were collapsing.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder... Elder Sister?\u201d After a long moment passed, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and was about to turn and look at Third Fatty Hei, when suddenly Li Qinghou\u2019s cold voice rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cQuit running your mouth and catch up! \u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun hurried after Li Qinghou, looking more bitter than ever. After a few paces, he turned, looked back down at the Ovens, and sighed.</p><br/><p>It had been quite a while since Bai Xiaochun learned that the Spirit Stream Sect\u2019s north bank had four mountain peaks, and that the south bank had three. Li Qinghou was the peak lord of the third mountain, Fragrant Cloud Peak. The position of peak lord was very distinguished in the sect.</p><br/><p>Although Fragrant Cloud Peak didn\u2019t look very big, upon entering it, one would realize that it was filled with the singing of birds and the fragrant aroma of flowers. It looked like a celestial paradise, and was actually much larger on the inside than it appeared to be from the outside.</p><br/><p>Actually, the finish line of the trial by fire was only the peak of one of the auxiliary spurs of the mountain as a whole, and really only counted as the foot of the mountain.</p><br/><p>Mist swirled about everywhere, as well as an occasional medicinal aroma, a single whiff of which would lift the spirits and send a warm feeling through the body. Bai Xiaochun could immediately tell that this place was extraordinary. He took a deep breath, and his cultivation base, which hadn\u2019t made much progress in the past months, instantly surged to life.</p><br/><p>Li Qinghou didn\u2019t look back, but his eyes gleamed with a bit of admiration. Even he felt that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s progress in cultivation in the past year wasn\u2019t bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that you\u2019re an Outer Sect disciple, you can\u2019t go and cause any more trouble,\u201d Li Qinghou said slowly. \u201cPracticing cultivation is like rowing a boat against the current. It requires constant effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t dare say anything back. He put on the most charming expression he could, and nodded continuously.</p><br/><p>\u201cSect resources are only one aspect of cultivation for Outer Sect disciples,\u201d Li Qinghou continued. \u201cYou also need to work hard and take advantage of whatever opportunities come your way. There are plenty of missions that you can take on for the sect. In a moment, you can go look at the missions and pick a few to start your training.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun heard that, his heart suddenly thumped. A while back when flipping through the sect rules, he had noticed one particular rule about Outer Sect disciple being required to accomplish at least one mission every so often. If they didn\u2019t, they would be punished by being demoted from Outer Sect disciple to servant.</p><br/><p>He immediately went wild with joy. However, Li Qinghou had apparently realized what he was thinking, and coolly said, \u201cDon\u2019t go thinking about breaking the sect rules. Other people might be demoted to servant for not accomplishing missions, but if you try something like that, I\u2019ll expel you from the sect and return you to your village. A hundred years from now I might even burn some incense for you, if I haven\u2019t forgotten about you by then.\u201d</p><br/><p>That frightened Bai Xiaochun half to death. If he had never seen this world of immortals, it wouldn\u2019t have been so bad. But now that he was on the way to living forever, he had no desire at all to go back to his village. If that happened, he might as well forget about trying to live forever. He quickly smacked himself in the chest and told himself that he would definitely go and accomplish some missions.</p><br/><p>Soon, they were in the middle section of Fragrant Cloud Peak. A building appeared out of the mists, not very large, but very elegant-looking. Visible through one of the windows was a young man, who sat there quietly reading a book.</p><br/><p>As if having sensed someone approaching, the young man looked up, revealing a handsome-looking face. When he saw Li Qinghou, he immediately walked out of the building and clasped hands in greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cDisciple offers greetings, peak lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is disciple Bai Xiaochun. Take him and get him set up in the Outer Sect.\u201d Li Qinghou gave Bai Xiaochun a final look before transforming into a beam of prismatic light that shot further up the mountain.</p><br/><p>Now that Li Qinghou was gone, Bai Xiaochun could heave a sigh of relief. All of a sudden, he felt as if a weight had been lifted off of his shoulders, and the sky was now blue again.</p><br/><p>The young man measured Bai Xiaochun up, then laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, are you the guy who\u2019s been blocking the trial by fire and selling spots? It\u2019s... Bai Xiaochun, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun chuckled. \u201cYou\u2019re praising me for nothing, Elder Brother. A small thing like that isn\u2019t even worth mentioning.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young man laughed even harder at that. Clearly, he was very amused by Bai Xiaochun. Dropping the topic, he began to lead Bai Xiaochun around Fragrant Cloud Peak, pointing out some of the important buildings along the way.</p><br/><p>\u201cFragrant Cloud Peak occupies an important position on the south bank. Green Crest Peak is known for its sword cultivators, Violet Cauldron Peak for their magical techniques. As for the Fragrant Cloud Peak, we excel in concocting spirit medicines.</p><br/><p>\u201cFragrant Cloud Peak is famous even among the four great sects on this branch of the Heavenspan River. That\u2019s especially true of his excellency the peak lord, who is one of the two most famous apothecaries in the Eastwood Continent.</p><br/><p>\u201cTherefore, becoming an Outer Sect disciple of Fragrant Cloud Peak also makes you an apprentice apothecary. That means you need to study about plants and vegetation, as well as different medicine concocting techniques.\u201d The young man continued to provide even more detailed explanations to Bai Xiaochun as they walked along. Eventually, they reached the location where Bai Xiaochun received his Outer Sect disciple clothing and equipment, including a bag of holding.</p><br/><p>Although the bag of holding didn\u2019t fit much inside, Bai Xiaochun found the thing to be marvelous. After testing it out a few times, he put it away as carefully as if it were a precious treasure.</p><br/><p>What delighted him more than anything else was that getting promoted to Outer Sect disciple also came with a reward of twenty spirit stones. Now, he had just enough to buy the medicinal plants he needed.</p><br/><p>Soon it was dusk. Thanks to the explanations provided by the young man, Bai Xiaochun now knew a lot about Fragrant Cloud Peak. Eventually, the young man led him to a place called the 10,000 Medicines Pavilion.</p><br/><p>From there, he received a jade slip.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis jade slip describes 10,000 types of plants and vegetation. You need to memorize all of them, and then you can get the second jade slip.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Bai, the path of cultivation is a long one, and spirit medicines are an aid that you can\u2019t do without. If you can become an apothecary, you\u2019ll be able to achieve a meteoric rise here.</p><br/><p>\u201cApprentice apothecary, journeyman apothecary, master apothecary....\u201d the young man said with a smile. \u201cJunior Brother Bai, your future progress will all depend on what good fortune you encounter.\u201d By the time night fell, the young man had led him to the courtyard dwelling the sect had arranged as his residence.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Bai, I have to head off the mountain tomorrow, so I won\u2019t be able to accompany you to the Scripture Pavilion. Go there at dawn to get the rest of the Violet Qi Cauldron Control Art mnemonics. You\u2019ll also be able to pick one more magical technique from the selection they have there. It\u2019s a good opportunity to get some things for free. After that, you\u2019ll have to pay merit points for any magical techniques you want.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you don\u2019t understand, you can always come looking for me. My name is Hou Yunfei. Many thanks for taking care of Xiaomei for me.\u201d Hou Yunfei smiled, clasped hands and bowed. Then he turned and walked away.</p><br/><p>\u201cHou Yunfei?\u201d Bai Xiaochun returned the bow and watched Hou Yunfei walking off. After a moment of thought, he recalled the face of a young woman.</p><br/><p>\u201cHou Xiaomei!\u201d he thought, blinking. He suddenly realized that he had struck it very lucky, as if he'd shoved a random stick into the ground only to have it grow into a lovely shady tree.</p><br/><p>After a moment, he took a deep breath and then looked over at his courtyard residence. His eyes gleamed, and he stood tall and straight beneath the moonlight.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I guess becoming an Outer Sect disciple isn\u2019t that bad after all!\u201d Flicking his sleeve, he walked into the courtyard.</p><div id=\"footnote-67dc\"><br/><p>1. 1.

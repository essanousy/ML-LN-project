Even as he recalled the words spoken to him from within the jade slip, the little turtle shrieked and flew back into his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you die, kid, I\u2019ll burn some incense for you! It\u2019s too bad that Lord Turtle just escaped the clutches of evil, only to get stuck in this place....\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was completely infuriated. Gritting his teeth, he howled, \u201cShut your mouth!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, now was not the time to worry about the little turtle. \u201cListen up, you big toad! I know you can hear me! Let me go, and I won\u2019t hurt you!</p><br/><p>\u201cI agree that the cultivator from ancient times pushed things too far with you. That doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me. I\u2019m innocent, alright!? Let me go! We don\u2019t have any grudges with each other.... Let\u2019s talk things over! There\u2019s no need to hurt each other, okay? When I really attack, I frighten even myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as his words were still echoing about, rumbling sounds filled the inside of the huge toad, and intense pressure exploded out. Bai Xiaochun trembled, coughing up a mouthful of blood as his bones creaked ominously.</p><br/><p>Within the intense pressure, he could sense a raging malice, as though the hatred the toad felt for the ancient cultivator was now being transferred to Bai Xiaochun. Apparently, no matter what Bai Xiaochun said, it wouldn\u2019t listen at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou....\u201d he said, trembling, a sensation of deadly crisis rising up within him. However, before he could say anything else, the pressure mounted, and the immortal's cave began to collapse even more quickly. The little turtle was screaming, and Bai Xiaochun was on the verge of going mad.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou big bully!!\u201d he cried, wounds opening up all over him, soaking his robes with blood. There was no time for rumination. The toad was clearly attempting to kill him. Gritting his teeth, he followed the instructions within the jade slip, reaching out with his right hand to grab the black parasol. Then, he stabbed it viciously down into the ground.</p><br/><p>The razor-sharp tip of the parasol slid smoothly into the ground, and then down into the flesh and blood of the toad!</p><br/><p>As blood spurted out, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes gleamed, and he tightened his grip on the parasol. With the other hand, he performed an incantation gesture and simultaneously muttered some incomprehensible words of enchantment. Then, just in the moment that the immortal's cave was about to completely fall to pieces, he roared, \u201cEternal!\u201d</p><br/><p>In response, black light exploded out from the Eternal Parasol. In the blink of an eye, it filled the immortal's cave, and then began to spread out to cover other parts of the toad\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>As the black light spread, it stimulated various restrictive spells which had been placed throughout the toad. The spells began to rumble, and yet, apparently because of the vast amount of time which had passed, most of them were weakened and in complete disrepair. In the end, only a few thousand activated fully. However, each one of that small group alone managed to create a massive gravitational force, something like a black hole!</p><br/><p>The thousand or so restrictive spells were like a thousand black holes inside the huge toad, with the Eternal Parasol forming the nucleus of them all.</p><br/><p>As the gravitational force spread out, the toad began to tremble, and emit increasingly intense roars. Bai Xiaochun was shaking as, all of a sudden, the black holes began to gobble up the life force of the toad and send it toward the Eternal Parasol!</p><br/><p>An indescribably boundless power of qi and blood then began to flow through the parasol into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s right hand!</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind was spinning. His gaze was vacant, and his hair whipped around him. It felt like his soul was about to fly out of his body. His mind slowly became a blank as the seemingly endless power of qi and blood flowed into him!</p><br/><p>Qi and blood could also be considered life force, and as it flowed madly into him, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Undying Live Forever Technique began to spin of its own accord. It was almost like immortal nectar being poured down onto cracked, parched ground. The technique rapidly advanced until Bai Xiaochun was shaking where he stood. His fleshly body began to grow stronger at an incredible, explosive rate!</p><br/><p>A third heavenly demon appeared!</p><br/><p>A fourth heavenly demon appeared!</p><br/><p>Almost immediately, four heavenly demons appeared behind him, their heads thrown back as they howled, sending boundless might out in all directions. However, the struggling of the toad only intensified.</p><br/><p>Unceasing rumbling sounds echoed out as the more than one thousand restrictive spells began to collapse, causing miserable shrieking sounds to echo out inside of the toad\u2019s body.</p><br/><p>However, the gravitational force persisted. With every breath of time that passed, boundless life force flowed through the restrictive spells and into the Eternal Parasol, to be absorbed by Bai Xiaochun. As it did, more heavenly demons formed!</p><br/><p>A fifth!</p><br/><p>A sixth!</p><br/><p>The little turtle cautiously peeped out of the bag of holding, and then his jaw dropped. He even started to feel a little jealous.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, what kind of luck is this!?!?\u201d Finally, he simply rolled his eyes in a rare moment of speechlessness. By this point, he could tell that, in truth, not even 10,000 Bai Xiaochuns put together would be a match for the huge toad. However, the toad was filled with countless restrictive spells, all of which were focused onto the parasol.</p><br/><p>More accurately, Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t the one absorbing the toad\u2019s life force, it was the parasol. All Bai Xiaochun had to do was recite the correct enchantment.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho exactly put this immortal's cave here?\u201d the turtle thought. \u201cThis kind of thing is really rare!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in the wild mountains outside, the huge toad was roaring so loudly that brightly colored light flashed in heaven and earth. A huge wind screamed in all directions, and mountains in the area were collapsing into pieces as the toad flailed back and forth, withering visibly the entire time.</p><br/><p>Birds and beasts alike were shaking in fear, and many were killed in the quaking. The entire 5,000-kilometer area was being turned into nothing more than ruins as the toad descended into madness. Beyond that region, the five patriarchs of the Spirit Stream Sect were closing in at top speed, along with the legacy echelon cultivators.</p><br/><p>The Heavenhorn ink dragon was with them, leading the way. The founding patriarch\u2019s expression was grave; they had been at a critical juncture in extracting the beast skeleton when the news came in from the dragon. Although they couldn\u2019t stop the process in the middle, they had been able to speed up their work. After successfully collecting the beast skeleton, they summoned the legacy echelon, and then used the Heavenhorn ink dragon scales they all possessed to head over to rescue Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat toad probably has battle prowess in the late Nascent Soul stage,\u201d the founding patriarch said through gritted teeth. \u201cIf it dares to hurt our junior patriarch, I'm going to sever its tendons and skin it alive!!\u201d Patriarch Ironwood, Li Zimo, and the other two patriarchs were all extremely anxious; if something bad happened to Bai Xiaochun, it would be a disaster for the River-Defying Sect.</p><br/><p>Although they would still be just as powerful as before, there would surely be schisms and divisions in the near future.</p><br/><p>Li Qinghou\u2019s eyes were completely bloodshot, and he radiated icy killing intent as he shot through the air.</p><br/><p>The Heavenhorn ink dragon was feeling very nervous, and didn\u2019t dare to say much. All it could do was lead the way as quickly as possible. Soon, they were within the 5,000-kilometer area that was affected by the toad\u2019s rampage. Before the Heavenhorn ink dragon could even comment, intense booms could be heard, and mountains could be seen collapsing. The ground was shaking violently, and countless birds and beasts were dying. The patriarchs and legacy echelon cultivators all gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shocked, and even more nervous than before, the group headed forward at top speed.</p><br/><p>It was around that time that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s seventh heavenly demon roared into existence.</p><br/><p>After that was the eighth, and then the ninth!</p><br/><p>Nine heavenly demons all appeared behind him, causing his fleshly body to rocket to unprecedented heights. The cultivation of the Undying Live Forever Technique required life force; with enough of it, the potential for progress was virtually limitless.</p><br/><p>Back in the Blood Stream Sect, he had been able to use the blood qi of the Blood Ancestor to quicken his progress. Now, he was using the qi and blood from this huge toad to make terrifyingly quick progress toward the second level of the Undying Live Forever Technique.</p><br/><p>The tenth heavenly demon was rapidly forming, and once it was complete, Bai Xiaochun would reach the Asura Body level of the Undying Live Forever Technique!</p><br/><p>After the Asura Body was the highest level, the Undying Heavenly King Body!</p><br/><p>When that time came, he would be able to break through the second shackle of life, and potentially form a Fleshly Body Nascent Core, which was also more commonly known as an Undying Heavenly King Core!</p><br/><p>RUMBLE!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was trembling visibly. As the life force poured into him and the tenth heavenly demon took shape, a miraculous transformation was occurring in his spiritual seas.</p><br/><p>His seventh spiritual sea suddenly crystallized, and then his eighth! In fact, the process was going along so rapidly that his ninth spiritual sea was already about half crystallized, and was continued to grow more solid by the second.</p><br/><p>He was growing stronger in all aspects. To Bai Xiaochun, this was an incredible good fortune, and all of it was because of the Eternal Parasol!</p><br/><p>The parasol seemed to radiate an evil aura as it rapidly sucked in the life force of the toad through the restrictive spells. By this point, the toad was like a candle flickering on the verge of being extinguished!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

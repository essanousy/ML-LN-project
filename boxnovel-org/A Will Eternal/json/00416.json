If the voice had belonged to an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator, their reaction might not have been so extreme. After all, the entire group had extraordinary latent talent, and were also listed among the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars. They were the type of people who wouldn\u2019t be fazed by ordinary Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><br/><p>But Feng Youde was in the late Nascent Soul stage, a cultivation base level that surpassed most ordinary Nascent Soul experts, and as such, the hearts of the Flashflame Four were filled with fear.</p><br/><p>Of course, most terrifying of all was not Feng Youde\u2019s cultivation base, but rather, his status in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect. People who were capable of rising to the position of hallmaster on any of the rainbow districts were few and far between.</p><br/><p>And even more telling was that he was the hallmaster of the Hall of Devil Slayers. Although each of the four rainbow districts had its own Hall of Devil Slayers, the cultivators from any of them were always fierce and terrifying. Very, very few people would ever dare to provoke a Nascent Soul eccentric like that, and the fact that he had shown up burning with fury left the Flashflame Four trembling in fear.</p><br/><p>If that was the case with those four, there was little need to mention Li Yuansheng. While it was true that he was from a deva clan, and that such a clan wouldn\u2019t fear a single Nascent Soul hallmaster, Li Yuansheng was not here as a representative of his clan. He had come here of his own volition.</p><br/><p>Not even a powerful clan like his would risk offending a hallmaster because of a conflict with a single clan member, not even one who could potentially reach the Deva Realm one day.</p><br/><p>Li Yuansheng understood that immediately, and therefore, was filled with terror. Inwardly, he was howling in grief, and couldn\u2019t help but think back to what Master Cloud-Dao had told him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this Bai Xiaochun have someone so powerful backing him!?!?\u201d he thought. For the first time, Li Yuansheng regretted everything he had done, especially when he saw the trembling Flashflame Four glaring at him with venomous hatred.</p><br/><p>Bracing himself, he clasped hands and began to speak, \u201cSenior Feng, please, I--\u201d</p><br/><p>Moments before, Bai Xiaochun had been staring at Feng Youde in shock.</p><br/><p>Despite having sent the message requesting help, he was still deeply shaken by the fact that Feng Youde had actually come in person. After all, this was not a sect affair at all, and thus, the lengths to which Feng Youde was going to watch out for him were beyond what he ever could have imagined.</p><br/><p>Therefore, as soon as he realized Feng Youde\u2019s stance in the situation, he pointed at the Flashflame Four, and interrupted Li Yuansheng to say, \u201cHallmaster, these were the ones who wanted to take my poor little life. And that guy down there was trying to force me to give him my property-bestowal flag! Once that flag came out of the ground, I would be dead for sure!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even the Flashflame Four opened their mouths to offer some explanations.</p><br/><p>As Feng Youde hovered there in midair, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit down. After receiving Bai Xiaochun\u2019s message, he had hesitated about what to do. After all, considering his status, it was completely inappropriate for him to act like Bai Xiaochun\u2019s bodyguard. But considering what the Heavenspan emissary had promised him, he had ended up gritting his teeth and intervening.</p><br/><p>Upon arriving and seeing the Flashflame Four attacking Bai Xiaochun, he made his decision. He would help Bai Xiaochun in this situation, and do it in a way that would scare any other disciple who harbored thoughts of causing problems. That way, there would be no further such incidents in the future.</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no, that\u2019s not what happened, sir!\u201d Li Yuansheng stammered. \u201cSenior Feng, please listen to--\u201d</p><br/><p>Eyes radiating coldness, Feng Youde snorted, interrupting Li Yuansheng and simultaneously waving his sleeve. Instantly, a majestic power parted the clouds and descended, transforming into a powerful attack. To the shock of Bai Xiaochun and everyone else present, that attack slammed into the Flashflame Four, causing blood to spray out of their mouths as they were violently tossed 300 meters away.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet the hell back to where you came from,\u201d Feng Youde said coolly, \u201cand focus on cultivation. From now on, don\u2019t get involved in things like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing how events were unfolding, Bai Xiaochun also shouted, \u201cYeah, get the hell back to where you came from and focus on cultivation. From now on, don\u2019t get involved in things like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Flashflame Four staggered to their feet, blood oozing out of their mouths. Not daring to offer even a single retort, they clasped hands, shot angry glances at Li Yuansheng, then turned and left.</p><br/><p>Trembling, Li Yuansheng began to back up subconsciously, but before he could get very far, Feng Youde\u2019s ice-cold gaze fell on him. Then Feng Youde waved his sleeve, sending a gale-force wind slamming into Li Yuansheng, who screamed and coughed up blood as he was thrown off into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don't care how long you\u2019ve had a grudge with Bai Xiaochun. If you insist on causing problems, then I\u2019ll issue an order pulling you into the Hall of Devil Slayers for a bit of hardcore training.\u201d In response, Li Yuansheng\u2019s face became a mask of terror, and he trembled even more than before. Not only did he have no desire to join the Hall of Devil Slayers, he was also filled with incredible regret and bitterness that Bai Xiaochun had someone so powerful watching out for him. Bowing his head, he turned to make his escape, vowing to never cause problems for Bai Xiaochun ever again.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun could see how scared he was at the threat, and therefore, couldn\u2019t hold back from excitedly yelling, \u201cThat's right, Li Yuansheng! If you ever provoke me again, you can come join me in the Hall of Devil Slayers! Hey, where are you going? Hold on a second, you destroyed my tavern! You owe me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heart dripping with blood, Li Yuansheng gritted his teeth and threw a bag of holding out behind him before scurrying off into the distance.</p><br/><p>Delighted that everything had been resolved, Bai Xiaochun looked up at Feng Youde, then clasped hands and bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, Hallmaster!\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Youde looked down at Bai Xiaochun, cleared his throat, and offered a few words of encouragement. Then he turned and left. The sensation of having been summoned by another person left him feeling very unsettled.</p><br/><p>After Feng Youde left, Xu Baocai and the other Azure Dragon Society cultivators turned to look at Bai Xiaochun as if he were some sort of god. Never could they have imagined that their moment of deadly crisis would have been resolved in such a way.</p><br/><p>The mere wave of his hand summoned a Nascent Soul cultivator, something that left everyone shaken, including all of the cultivators who had come to watch the show.</p><br/><p>Under the glowing eyes of all present, Bai Xiaochun strutted over to Xu Baocai and the others, puffed his chest out, and handed over a sizeable sum of merit points. Eyes sparkling, he then made his way proudly back to Sky Quarter Rainbow and his immortal's cave.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can't believe I'm so important to him,\u201d he thought. \u201cHe actually came when I summoned him, and unwillingly at that, from the look on his face. Actually, the Sky Quarter peak lord also had the same look on his face back when I saw him....</p><br/><p>\u201cHas someone forced them to watch out for me? But who?\u201d</p><br/><p>Time passed. An entire month flew by. During that time, Li Yuansheng didn\u2019t cause any trouble for Bai Xiaochun, nor did the Hall of Devil Slayers assign him any missions.</p><br/><p>Whenever he went to visit the Hall of Devil Slayers, if he saw something he liked, he would take it on credit. The only exception were certain extremely rare and precious items which were only made available to the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t pay too much attention to those things. Life was good, and his cultivation base was slowly progressing.</p><br/><p>Eventually, he came to realize that if he wanted to cultivate his Living Mountain Incantation on the second-level rainbow, all he needed to do was buy a certain type of command medallion from the Hall of Devil Slayers, which acted as a single-use pass. Considering that they weren\u2019t very expensive, he bought several.</p><br/><p>Of the second-level rainbows, the one on the left was for the deva patriarch, whereas the one on the right was for the sect leader.</p><br/><p>That rainbow was also known by the name Myriad Star Rainbow.</p><br/><p>Myriad Star Rainbow was also the location of various unique locations for training and trials by fire, which were accessible to disciples who possessed the requisite command medallions.</p><br/><p>There was a reason for Myriad Star Rainbow\u2019s name, and that was because it was also where the list of cultivators in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars was on display. Cultivators like that were the type who could shake the entire eastern cultivation world!</p><br/><p>The Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars list was quite eye-catching; it took up roughly thirty percent of Myriad Star Rainbow, upon which could be seen a collection of numerous glittering stars.</p><br/><p>The stars were distributed among the various seven colors of the rainbow, most of them being in the red portion; those were so densely packed that they were impossible to count. After that, the numbers were distributed as such: orange, tens of thousands; yellow, thousands; green, a single thousand; cyan, four or five hundred; blue, a bit over a hundred. The fewest stars were in the violet section, where only eight were visible!</p><br/><p>Each of those colors represented a different trial by fire, and as for the stars, they stood for different Chosen!</p><br/><p>Only those who qualified to be on this rainbow were considered to be Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars. Of course, many, many cultivators didn\u2019t qualify, and as such, anyone who could get onto that list was the subject of much envy on the part of others, and would instantly be quite well-known.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, in order to foster this trend, the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect\u2019s grand spell formation had a special function; a disciple who looked closely at any of those stars would suddenly find the name of that particular Chosen floating in their mind.</p><br/><p>Because of that, countless disciples in the sect were completely and utterly determined to become one of the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars.</p><br/><p>Once their name was on that rainbow, their names would be able to completely shake heaven and earth. Of course, only cultivators under the Nascent Soul stage could be Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

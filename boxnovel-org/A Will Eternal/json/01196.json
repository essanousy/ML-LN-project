He might have taken Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words to be mere ravings, except for the fact that his divine sense was actually connecting to the sovereign\u2019s arm!</p><br/><p>That connection seemed completely and utterly inconceivable.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s just a celestial! He's not even an archaean. And yet he\u2019s actually connecting to that sovereign\u2019s arm!!\u201d He almost couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. Despite the fact that he had sensed the sovereign\u2019s aura influencing Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation over the years, he still couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat secret is he hiding!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it have something to do with the fact that he's from the Eternal Immortal Domains\u2026? Maybe he\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochi\u2019s eyes went even wider than they had been before. He hadn\u2019t thought much of the Eternal Immortal Domains, but as of this moment, he couldn\u2019t help but recall\u2026 a legend that his previous master had spoken of!</p><br/><p>Even as the spirit automaton stood there shaken, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s divine sense connected fully to the sovereign\u2019s arm, and he began to pour his thoughts into it.</p><br/><p>What had previously been only a vague outline of the arm now became clearer, and he began to absorb it into his mind!</p><br/><p>It was very similar to the way that he had meditated on the face of the beast statue in the Spirit Stream Sect all those years ago.</p><br/><p>Time began to pass. One year. Three years. Five years\u2026.</p><br/><p>Before long, ten years had passed!</p><br/><p>During that decade, Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t move. He was completely immersed in his pursuit of enlightenment. Although he hadn\u2019t fused with the sovereign\u2019s arm completely, his understanding of it was becoming drastically more complete!</p><br/><p>Eventually, Bai Xiaochun emerged from his trance, and when he did, his eyes shone with light that struck Bai Xiaochi down to his very soul.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, Bai Xiaochun was emanating an aura that Bai Xiaochi could not possibly mistake for anything else, weak as it was!!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe aura of a sovereign!!\u201d he said with a gasp.</p><br/><p>Ignoring Bai Xiaochi\u2019s shock, Bai Xiaochun slowly rose to his feet and looked down at his right arm. His eyes glittered with the light of augury for a long moment, and then he clenched his hand into a fist!</p><br/><p>As he did, an enormous, shadowy emperor appeared behind him, clad in imperial robes and wearing an imperial crown. As for his facial features, they were an exact match for Bai Xiaochun\u2019s!</p><br/><p>The Undying Emperor\u2019s Fist!</p><br/><p>However\u2026 this emperor was different from the emperors that had appeared in the past\u2026. His right arm did not match the rest of his body. It looked\u2026 exactly like the sovereign\u2019s wolf-like arm!!</p><br/><p>Everything down to the bones, the flesh, and the blood were all exactly like the sovereign\u2019s, and it radiated a sovereign aura that made it seem vastly more powerful than before!</p><br/><p>It was an aura that could shake celestials and archaeans alike!</p><br/><p>This was what Bai Xiaochun had gained after ten years of meditation. He had incorporated the sovereign\u2019s arm into his Undying Emperor\u2019s Fist, fusing the two together! Clenching his hand into a fist, he punched out into the air!</p><br/><p>Instantly, the sovereign aura erupted, filling the void with dazzling light, and sending a massive tempest of wind out across the damaged fan\u2026. Any celestial or archaean who saw this\u2026 would be shaken to the core!</p><br/><p>The fan itself trembled, and Bai Xiaochi\u2019s eyes bulged on the verge of popping out of his skull.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe actually did it\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked down at his new right arm, and softly said, \u201cFrom now on, my Undying Emperor\u2019s Fist is going to be called\u2026 the Undying Sovereign\u2019s Fist!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt combines the power of my Sutra of Former Reincarnation and my Sutra of Present Life and Death. It will be a trump card that I can use to fight archaeans!\u201d Eyes flickering with determination, he flew off of the sovereign\u2019s arm and back to the Daoist Tower of Life and Death. There, he sent his divine sense out, anticipation burning in his heart.</p><br/><p>Zhou Zimo and Song Junwan were still asleep. However, much of the color had been restored to their faces, indicating that much of their Life Essence had been restored. Bruiser was similarly recovering well. As for Song Que, he looked exactly the same as he had before, prompting a light sigh from Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>At this point, his eyes flickered with cold light as he waved his hand, producing a faintly glimmering soul from his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>It was the Vile-Prince\u2019s soul, which had long since lost self-awareness, and didn\u2019t even have the power to struggle against Bai Xiaochun as he held it.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could I possibly allow you to die a quick death?\u201d All of his time up to this point had been focused on reaching the late Celestial Realm and creating his Undying Sovereign\u2019s Fist. Up to now, he hadn\u2019t had any spare time to deal with the Vile-Prince!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou like switching bodies, right? And puppets?\u201d Eyes shining with merciless anger, he waved his hand, causing an array of materials to fly out from the damaged fan, which he rapidly transformed into a puppet to put the Vile-Prince\u2019s soul in.</p><br/><p>At that point, the Vile-Prince regained some of his self-awareness, and after realizing that he was now trapped in a puppet body, looked up in terror at Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you do this to me, Bai Xiaochun! My father the emperor will never let you get away with it! He's definitely going to find you!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour father the emperor? Hmph. The emperor is no longer your father. But don't worry, I'm still your enemy.\u201d Performing an incantation gesture with his right hand, he forced the puppet-form Vile-Prince to dance wildly in front of the huge tower, just as the prince\u2019s puppets had been forced to do back in the imperial palace.</p><br/><p>Those puppets had lost their lives to perform that dance, and the Vile-Prince had lost his soul to perform his. As he danced wildly, his terror mounted. After all, the wildness of his dance was causing his soul to slowly disperse. Clearly\u2026 he was being killed in the same way that he had tormented his own victims!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullcrap!\u201d he suddenly blurted. \u201cWhat do you mean the emperor isn\u2019t my father?!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun simply snorted coldly and started walking away. He would let the Vile-Prince dance his way into death, as his soul dispersed.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou like dancing, don\u2019t you?\u201d he said over his shoulder. \u201cDance away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo! This can\u2019t be happening. Let me go, Bai Xiaochun. I won\u2019t ever bother you again, I promise. I guarantee it\u2026.\u201d Unfortunately for him, his pleas fell on deaf ears. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hatred for him simply ran too deep.</p><br/><p>And thus, the Vile-Prince danced madly for nine days. At that point, the puppet body continued to dance, but his soul was almost completely faded away. He almost had no self-awareness left. On the tenth day\u2026 he danced into death, and his soul dispersed.</p><br/><p>At that point, the materials which had made up his puppet body stopped moving, and then collapsed onto the ground\u2026.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun watched from a distance, with Bai Xiaochi standing at his side, more terrified than ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cDeath cannot wipe out your crimes!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said through gritted teeth, his hatred still festering in his heart. Finally, he stood up and went over to collect the materials that had once made up the puppet body. Even as he did, Bai Xiaochi\u2019s face suddenly flickered dramatically, and he flew up off the surface of the fan to look out into the void.</p><br/><p>Rumbling fluctuations rose up which caused the damaged fan to tremble, and suddenly change directions of its own volition.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe other half of the fan!\u201d Bai Xiaochi shouted excitedly. \u201cThe other half!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jaw dropping, Bai Xiaochun left the fan face and appeared on one of the ribs. Looking out into the void, he saw a glowing light off in the distance, rushing toward them at high speed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

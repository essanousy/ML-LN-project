Cold smiles could be seen on all of their faces; clearly, they were confident that anyone who disturbed their Young Lord\u2019s cultivation would meet a grisly fate.</p><br/><p>This was not the first time Sima Feiru had staked claim to a cultivation area, nor was it the first time someone had attempted to interfere with him when he did. However, nobody had ever been successful in an attempt to drive him away, and everyone always ended up backing down.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiaochun, in his anxiety and rage, his eyes flickered with cold light as he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and pointed down at the freezing cistern.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d he shouted, unleashing the Frigid School Will-Evolving Incantation through his right index finger. Instantly, frigid qi that bordered on the Frigid Master level shot down.</p><br/><p>Even as Sima Feiru prepared to burst out of his cistern, the frigid qi poured down like a beam of light, slamming into the water. Instantly, cracking sounds rang out, and the entire cistern was frozen solid!</p><br/><p>Not only was the cistern frozen, but the gigantic face was as well, and even Sima Feiru as he prepared to burst out into the open.</p><br/><p>Sima Feiru\u2019s face fell; before he could even struggle, he was locked in place, and the terrifying frigid qi that entered him turned him into a statue of ice....</p><br/><p>His mouth was stuck open, and his eyes were wide with complete and utter disbelief.</p><br/><p>As for his followers in the area, they all gasped, and their eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow... how is this possible?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that Bai Xiaochun? Heavens! He only ranks in the 490s, doesn't he? I can\u2019t believe he sealed Sima Feiru with the single wave of a finger!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sima Feiru\u2019s followers were left with minds spinning as Bai Xiaochun flew past them.</p><br/><p>Considering his speed, it didn\u2019t take him long to reach the Hall of Devil Slayers, which he entered without the slightest hesitation. Outside, Bai Xiaochun wasn't extremely famous, but inside the Hall of Devil Slayers, everyone treated him with the utmost respect. Because of how Feng Youde cared for him, Bai Xiaochun could do virtually anything he wanted. Nobody dared to interfere with him at all, and within moments, he was in front of the main temple.</p><br/><p>Upon entering the temple, he immediately caught sight of Feng Youde sitting at the far end. Hurrying over, he clasped hands and bowed deeply. \u201cBai Xiaochun offers greetings, Daoist Master! Daoist Master, I beg of you to save a life!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong this time?\u201d Feng Youde said, a bit begrudgingly.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun quickly explained the situation with Big Fatty Zhang, and continued to beg for Feng Youde\u2019s help, bowing over and over again at the waist as he did so.</p><br/><p>Feng Youde\u2019s expression soon turned serious. He had never seen Bai Xiaochun acting so earnestly. After hearing the situation, he thought for a moment, and then frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Will Core, huh? Very well, I\u2019ll go take a look.\u201d With that, he rose to his feet. Even as Bai Xiaochun continued to bow and scrape, Feng Youde flicked his sleeve, taking Bai Xiaochun away with him in a teleportation.</p><br/><p>When they reappeared, they were about 500 kilometers away, whereupon they teleported again. That put them outside of Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s immortal's cave. To see a teleportation magic like that with his own eyes left Bai Xiaochun shaken, and at the same time, a bit envious.</p><br/><p>Feng Youde led the way into Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s immortal's cave, where Master God-Diviner, Chen Manyao, and Xu Baocai were waiting. When they saw that Bai Xiaochun had brought Feng Youde with him, they quickly bowed and backed away.</p><br/><p>Feng Youde cared about Bai Xiaochun, but not the others, so he paid them absolutely no attention. Walking over to Big Fatty Zhang, he put his hand onto his forehead and sent some divine sense into him. After inspecting him for a moment, his expression turned even more grave than before.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun saw that, his heart began to pound, and his face drained of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt really is a Will Core....\u201d Feng Youde said, withdrawing his hand and frowning. Sighing, he looked over at Bai Xiaochun. \u201cHalf a month ago, I might have been able to help. But at this point, he\u2019s a candle flickering in the wind, only a step away from death. I simply don\u2019t have the power to save him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun felt like he had been hit with a sledgehammer. His heart was pounding, and his face was pale white as he staggered backward a few paces. Grief filled him, pushing him to the point where he felt like he was going to collapse.</p><br/><p>Almost immediately, he began to think back to all his memories of Big Fatty Zhang.</p><br/><p>\u201cIsn\u2019t there some other way?\u201d he said, looking over at the corpse-like Big Fatty Zhang.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho is he to you?\u201d Feng Youde asked, a profound light gleaming in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s my Eldest Brother!\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied. From the look in his eyes, he would clearly pay any price to save Big Fatty Zhang. Feng Youde was shaken by the level of determination he saw.</p><br/><p>Up to this point, he had only been watching out for Bai Xiaochun because of the promise given him by the Heavenspan emissary. But now, after seeing the look in his eyes, he could sense a level of sentiment in Bai Xiaochun that he hadn\u2019t seen for quite some time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would have thought that this kid would care so much about his friends\u2026?\u201d he murmured inwardly. Based on the level of his cultivation base, and his years of experience, he could tell that Bai Xiaochun was not putting on a show.</p><br/><p>After a moment of thought, he inspected Big Fatty Zhang more thoroughly. Enough time passed for half an incense stick to burn, whereupon he said, \u201cYou might still have a chance to save your Eldest Brother. However, the help of a Nascent Soul cultivator won\u2019t do it. You would need a Deva Realm cultivator from the Senior generation. Either that, or the power of a deva. Only then could the chaos surrounding the Will Core be nullified, and the core fully formed!\u201d</p><br/><p>A tremor ran through Bai Xiaochun, and his eyes began to shine with bright light. Without the slightest hesitation, he said, \u201cThe power of a deva? How do I get that?! I\u2019ll pay all of my merit points if I have to!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even Master God-Diviner, Chen Manyao, and Xu Baocai could sense the unswerving determination in his voice.</p><br/><p>Feng Youde shook his head. \u201cThe power of a deva can come only when an almighty deva gathers some of his or her aura into a talisman, transforming it into a disposable magical item. Usually, devas will give such talismans to their apprentices as a form of protection.</p><br/><p>\u201cSuch items take years to craft, and are astronomically valuable. They\u2019re not the type of thing you can purchase with merit points.\u201d</p><br/><p>Master God-Diviner sucked in a breath and exchanged a glance with Xu Baocai. Based on what they had just heard, it didn\u2019t seem like ordinary disciples would ever be able to get that type of item, something which was normally reserved for the apprentices of devas.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun turned even more ashen than before, and yet, he now had hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you want to get the power of a deva,\u201d Feng Youde continued, \u201cyou would have to take a deva as your Master. Either that, or challenge the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars trials, and reach the violet section of the rainbow. At that point, you would receive a boon from the sect, and could request the power of a deva!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe violet section of the rainbow?\u201d Xu Baocai said faintly. \u201cIs that even possible...?\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite having only been in the rainbow district for a short time, Xu Baocai had learned a bit about the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars, and he knew that reaching the violet portion of the rainbow was indescribably difficult.</p><br/><p>The violet trial by fire was the final trial, and in the current generation of disciples, there had long since been only eight in that group. It was only recently that Gongsun Wan\u2019er had become the ninth.</p><br/><p>If someone else reached that level, there would be ten!</p><br/><p>Xu Baocai wasn't the only one to be taken aback. Master God-Diviner and Chen Manyao were also shocked. Although all of them had confidence in Bai Xiaochun, when they heard that he needed to get the power of a deva by reaching the violet portion of the rainbow, their faces fell.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun stood there quietly for a few breaths of time, then looked up. \u201cHow much time do I have?\u201d</p><br/><p>Feng Youde sighed. \u201cYou\u2019ve made up your mind, then. Very well. I\u2019ll take your Eldest Brother back to the Hall of Devil Slayers to watch over him. Even still, you\u2019ll have no more than twelve hours!\u201d</p><br/><p>The look in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes turned as sharp as the edge of blade. \u201cMany thanks, Daoist Master. I\u2019ll leave this instant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Without even the slightest hint of hesitation, he turned, rushed out of the immortal's cave, and sped toward the teleportation portal!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

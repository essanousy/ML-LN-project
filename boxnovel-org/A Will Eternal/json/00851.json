That was especially true when he thought about the fact that the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, a majestic riversource sect, only had five devas. Any one of those five devas could be considered supremely important.</p><br/><p><span id=\"footnote-ref-8b2b\"><span>\u201cThey\u2019re all almighty figures who live on the blue rainbow.\u201d The more he thought about it, the more exciting it seemed. Then he thought back to his time at the Great Wall, and how the deva Chen Hetian had so brazenly screwed him over.\u00a0</span>[1]</span></p><br/><p>\u201cJust wait until I\u2019m back. It won\u2019t be long before I'm a deva. And then\u2026 hmmmphh! It\u2019s been decades, but it\u2019s still not too late to get my revenge, Chen Hetian!\u201d Bai Xiaochun felt extraordinary. His time in the Wildlands had propelled him toward the very peak of life. As of this moment, it would be very difficult to find very many chosen in heaven and earth who could match up to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a lonely feeling!\u201d Clasping his hands behind his back, he shook his head and savored the wonderful sensation. Then he swaggered out of his immortal's cave and walked over to the unconscious Song Que.</p><br/><p>Just looking at Song Que caused his head to ache. After a bit of thought, he waved his finger, sending a stream of spiritual energy into him. Song Que shivered and slowly opened his eyes. At first, his expression was blank, but when he saw Bai Xiaochun, he began to tremble. His eyes turned bloodshot, and his mind began to spin as he recalled everything that had occurred before he had passed out.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun quickly said, \u201cLet me explain, Que\u2019er, I--\u201d</p><br/><p>However, before he could say anything more, Song Que shouted, \u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026!\u201d</p><br/><p>The thought of him having become Bai Xiaochun\u2019s pet was the most horrific thing to ever happen in his life. The anger and resentment he felt because of it had him teetering on the verge of completely exploding.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s headache worsened. Seeing that Song Que was about to erupt, he scrambled to come up with a plan for what to do. Suddenly, his expression flickered. Instead of looking like he was trying to provide an explanation, he seemed somber, even sorrowful. Before Song Que could say anything, he spoke with such enormous volume that Song Que\u2019s madness was stifled.</p><br/><p>\u201cSong Que, I know you refuse to accept this. But. <em>Why</em> won\u2019t you accept it!? It\u2019s true that I, Bai Xiaochun, have reached incredible heights, in the Blood Stream Sect, the River-Defying Sect, the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, the Great Wall, and here in the Wildlands. But you\u2019ve only seen me in my best moments! Do you know how I got to those moments? I\u2019ll tell you. Fudge! The only reason I reached such heights was by sacrifice!\u201d This sudden outburst by Bai Xiaochun caught Song Que completely off-guard. He had never seen Bai Xiaochun acting like this before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, you people all abandoned me! I had only my own skill and ability to rely on. I started an inn, and even got you promoted to the rainbow district. I didn\u2019t owe you anything back then!</p><br/><p>\u201cAt the Great Wall, it was my skill with medicinal pills that saw me reach the rank of major general. Do you think the deva there was a complete idiot? Do you think the sect is full of fools? Do you think they just randomly allowed me to become a major general? No! I earned that rank with my success!\u201d He swished his sleeve to emphasize his words, and his voice thrummed with intense decisiveness. Despite the fact that Song Que was hovering on the verge of madness, he couldn\u2019t help but be shaken by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou saw for yourself how many people in the Wildlands want to kill me, right? Do you know how many deadly crises I faced? All of the nobility and aristocracy hate me down to their marrow! I even risked exposing myself to save you!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo what if I tousled your hair? What\u2019s so wrong with that? I'm not allowed to touch your head or something? I don't qualify? Not only am I your uncle, I have a demigod for a father-in-law! I'm the Master of the Hell-Emperor! I'm the overlord of the Wildlands! You want to talk status? I'm on the same level as the Celestial! Who out there dares to talk to me about qualifications?!\u201d By this point, he was shouting. Song Que\u2019s face was devoid of blood, and his humiliation and rage were collapsing. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s tirade caused him to edge backward, his eyes bloodshot, but his heart pounding as if with thunder.</p><br/><p>He had to admit that everything Bai Xiaochun had just said was true. Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t owe him anything, and yet had blessed him with good fortune. He had even saved him on multiple occasions. In fact, if it weren\u2019t for Bai Xiaochun, Song Que would either be dead, or at the very least, wallowing in abject misery.</p><br/><p>His refusal to accept the truth came mostly from his own pride. And the fact that he didn\u2019t like Bai Xiaochun was because of his own inability to measure up to him!</p><br/><p>As for the last thing Bai Xiaochun had just said, about qualifications, there was literally nothing Song Que could say by way of retort. All he could do there was stand there, his chest heaving.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun saw that Song Que had been cowed, he breathed an inward sigh of relief. He really had had no other choice than to say what he had. And the fact that it had worked had him feeling quite pleased with himself. However, he kept that somber expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to like me, Song Que. In fact, just think of me as a mountain that you will overturn one day in the future! Bai Xiaochun\u2026 will be waiting for you! But\u2026 before you acquire the proper qualifications, you <em>will</em> behave!\u201d With that, he waved his sleeve dramatically. His voice resonated in profoundly domineering fashion, and in fact, he even secretly threw in a bit of energy from the Undying Emperor\u2019s Fist. That, coupled with the actual words he had spoken, made him seem like a powerful king or emperor, the type who everyone would respect.</p><br/><p>His devastating verbal attack slammed into Song Que\u2019s mind, causing him to back up a few more paces. Trembling, he looked at Bai Xiaochun and suddenly realized that there was a bit of respect rising up in his heart!</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm going to be leaving the Wildlands and going back to the River-Defying Sect,\u201d Bai Xiaochun continued. \u201cSo, Song Que\u2026 do you want to come with me? If not, I won\u2019t force you!\u201d Snorting coldly, he looked away from Song Que and began to float slowly up into the air as he waited for a response.</p><br/><p>\u201cEverything I said should work,\u201d he thought. \u201cAi\u2026 what a headache! Oh, Junwan, how truly I care for this nephew of ours!\u201d Blinking a few times, he rubbed the bridge of his nose and sighed.</p><br/><p>As for Song Que, he stood there on the bank of the Underworld River, mixed emotions playing out in his eyes. Finally, he sighed and closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, they shone with determination.</p><br/><p>\u201cSooner or later, I'm going to surpass him!\u201d The truth was, even he didn't believe that. However, he was used to saying such things, and it would feel too strange to not say them. Snorting coldly, Song Que flew up into the air after Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun saw that, he breathed another inward sigh of relief. The truth was that he felt bad about the mistake he had made in reaching out to to touch Song Que\u2019s head\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t ask him to stick his head out toward me. He did that on his own!\u201d Of course, he didn\u2019t say that out loud. If he did, Song Que would likely explode, and he had just worked hard to calm him down.</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, he flies off the handle too easily.\u201d Shaking his head, he began to fly off into the distance, Song Que in tow. The two of them flew along silently for some time, heading toward the location where the eastern and northern sections of the Great Wall had once met. That was the location where they would head back to the River-Defying Sect. Their pathway home led through\u2026 the Deadmire!</p><br/><p>Based on the speed they were capable of, it would only take a few months for them to reach it!</p><br/><p>Two months passed in the blink of an eye. They didn\u2019t see any cities, only rugged and crumbling mountains and sprawling jungles. There were few soul cultivators, and only the occasional tribe of savage giants.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was already beginning to sigh at how quietly he was making his departure. It was almost as if no one cared about him\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, whatever. Keeping a low profile is always the best thing to do.\u201d Sighing again, he looked off at a distant mountain range. According to the map he had, after passing through those mountains, they would be on the very border of the Wildlands.</p><br/><p>However, even as he was preparing to lead Song Que in that direction, he stopped in place. Song Que, whose expression had been very grim during the last two months, suddenly looked off in a certain direction, his pupils constricting.</p><br/><p>At this point, the two of them realized that, standing right there at the peak of one of the nearby mountains, was a woman! She had long hair and a red robe, and was as beautiful and elegant as an immortal!</p><br/><p>She was none other than\u2026 Mistress Red-Dust, Zhou Zimo!</p><div id=\"footnote-8b2b\"><br/><p>1. Hey everyone, this chapter contains a detail that was never included in the original descriptions of the SSDPS. Apparently, each of the seven rainbows is a different color. I need to go back to check earlier references to see if I missed something in the earlier chapters, or if this is indeed a detail that was added later on. I vaguely remember some of the individual rainbows being described as having different colors in them. I will do that at some point, perhaps after the translation is completely done and I got back for a final edit. In any case, the rainbow that the devas live on is the blue one. \u00a0<i class=\"fa fa-hand-o-left\"></i></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

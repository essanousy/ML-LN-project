How dare you! Don\u2019t push me. I'm the number one dark inquisitor in Devil Penitentiary. When I get pissed off, I frighten even myself!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he placed his hand onto his bag of holding and considered whether or not to take out an Aphrodisiac Pill.</p><br/><p>When the Giant Ghost King saw the rage in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes, he was shocked. Then he remembered hearing that Bai Xiaochun was a dark inquisitor, and soon, hatred began to build up in his heart. He was a majestic demigod expert, the illustrious Giant Ghost King. The fact that a small fry like this was threatening to torment him caused him to grit his teeth in anger. However, he still managed to calm down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want, Bai Hao? Just tell me! Spit it out! Don\u2019t tell me that your betrayal of the Bai Clan was some elaborate plot!?!?\u201d The Giant Ghost King was able to control his anger so well that his voice actually didn't contain anything threatening in it all. As he spoke, he also couldn\u2019t help but glance at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s palm, and wonder if he was going to get slapped again.</p><br/><p>\u201cPlot my ass! You listen up, Giant Ghost King. Lord Bai wants--\u201d However, before he could finish his sentence, Cellblock D suddenly trembled, and then the entrance shook violently, almost as if someone was trying to break it open.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face fell as he looked over at the entrance. Another huge boom echoed out, and the entrance collapsed, revealing numerous figures who began to fly in.</p><br/><p>Then, a shout of rage erupted out, the type of which that contained unsurpassable animosity.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Hao!! The time has come for you to <em>die</em>!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was none other than the chief of the Bai Clan, flanked by numerous other cultivators from the direct bloodline.</p><br/><p>Even as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face fell, the little turtle transmitted a message.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s take the loot and run! They showed up sooner than expected, and Lord Turtle can\u2019t fully control the spell formation!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath to restore his calm. His eyes flashed with icy light as he unhesitatingly grabbed the Giant Ghost King by the neck, then turned to flee.</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me the command medallion, little punk,\u201d the little turtle shouted. \u201cFudge! I can\u2019t believe these people dare to interrupt our holy shakedown! Lord Turtle will open all the cells, that will completely screw them over!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way!\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied. \u201cIf you open all the cells and free the prisoners... they won\u2019t just start fighting the Bai Clan, they\u2019ll come after me!\u201d After all, as a dark inquisitor, Bai Xiaochun had interrogated many of the prisoners in the cells, most of whom now hated him with deep passion....</p><br/><p>The little turtle was too stunned at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s response to say anything. Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun shook his head and began to move forward, keeping the Giant Ghost King gripped in his hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can\u2019t hide, then I might as well fight!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun shouted, and afterimages appeared as he summoned his four clones. At the same time, he pulled out all sorts of magical items, many of which had fourteenfold spirit enhancements. Coupled with the power of his cultivation base, it made his energy surge to a shocking level.</p><br/><p>As the rumbling sounds echoed out, the distant members of the Bai Clan saw Bai Xiaochun. The clan chief\u2019s eyes turned bright red, and he bellowed with rage. Flanking him were five clan elders, all of them in the Nascent Soul stage, as well as a crowd of Core Formation experts.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to die, Bai Hao!!\u201d he shouted, immediately accelerating toward Bai Xiaochun.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun knew that this was a moment of deadly crisis, and that he couldn\u2019t afford to get involved in a protracted fight. Therefore, he pushed forward at top speed, using his frigid qi and Mountain Shaking Bash to achieve shocking speed.</p><br/><p>The little turtle also knew that it was a dangerous moment. Whooping with excitement, he tucked his head back into his shell to go along for the ride.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, Bai Xiaochun reached the forces from the Bai Clan.</p><br/><p>The divine abilities launched by the clan elders were handled by his four clones. At the same time, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s true self slammed into one of the early Nascent Soul stage elders, sending him tumbling backward several dozen meters. Instead of stopping, Bai Xiaochun continued forward. His four clones attacked another of the nearby clan elders, unleashing all sorts of divine abilities. Meanwhile, he used the Throat Crushing Grasp to crush the neck of one of the incoming cultivators.</p><br/><p>In the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint, the fiercest of fighting had broken out!</p><br/><p>Booms and shockwaves spread out in all directions, casting the entire area into chaos!</p><br/><p>Scintillating light shone out from Bai Xiaochun as he pulled out his transformed Eternal Parasol and stabbed it into the chest of a nearby enemy. It was a Bai Clan Core Formation cultivator, but it only took a moment for his muscular frame to be withered away, his life force sucked out of him with shocking speed!</p><br/><p>As Bai Xiaochun continued his shocking charge, golden designs flared up all over him that were impossible to conceal from the surrounding cultivators.</p><br/><p>He also threw out a fourteen-colored flame, which transformed into a sea of fire that burned anything it touched. As of this moment, Bai Xiaochun was like a celestial warrior, proceeding forward with shocking momentum!</p><br/><p>The fighting had only been going on for a moment, and had been matchlessly bitter. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hair was in disarray, but he didn\u2019t slow down in the slightest. A single fist strike sent the clan chief tumbling away, and caused other clan members to scatter. When he and his four clones all fought with full strength, they could crush anything in their path as easily as dried weeds.</p><br/><p>Although they seemed to be acting with practiced ease, they were actually in great danger. Two of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s clones had already been nearly destroyed by some of the clan elders, and were forced to transform into motes of light that flew back into Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Blood oozed out of the corner of his true self\u2019s mouth, and yet, he didn\u2019t slow in the slightest as he barreled toward the exit.</p><br/><p>It was a shocking sight for all the prisoners to behold, as well as the surrounding Bai Clan cultivators. The power and ferocity on display by Bai Xiaochun was hard to take in. However, even more shocking was the outrageous nature of his equipment</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! That... that magical item has a fourteenfold spirit enhancement!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Bai Hao is crazy! Even that leather armor of his has a fourteenfold spirit enhancement!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a genius! A spirit enhancing genius!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not getting away!!\u201d raged the clan chief, using a minor teleportation to close the distance between himself and Bai Xiaochun. The clan elders similarly gave chase.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was starting to get anxious. On the one hand, he was trying to break through the enemy to escape, but on the other hand, he had to make sure that the Giant Ghost King didn\u2019t get killed. As far as Bai Xiaochun was concerned, the Giant Ghost King was like a deva soul to him, so he couldn\u2019t let him die. However, to do both of those things at the same time was very difficult. In fact, it was actually impossible to shield the Giant Ghost King from all of the attacks being thrown their way.</p><br/><p>And yet, the Giant Ghost King didn't say a single word the entire time. The truth was that he was actually impressed by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s bravery and ferocity. His veins of steel were on full display, to the point where he seemed like a completely different person!</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that the Giant Ghost King wasn't saying anything, Bai Xiaochun found it strange that he was keeping silent. Furthermore, the attacks which found their way to him did nothing more than cause his face to turn a bit pale. He hadn't even coughed up any blood yet, and was clearly not injured in any way.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Giant Ghost King is a demigod expert. Don\u2019t tell me he\u2019s got some trick up his sleeve?\u201d Bai Xiaochun was stunned, but didn\u2019t have time to think about the matter. Four Bai Clan elders had just teleported in range, and were unleashing a divine ability, a black cloud filled with screaming, evil ghosts. Eyes bloodshot, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s jaw dropped, and he opened up the Eternal Parasol, causing dazzling light to flash out and block the evil ghosts. At that point, the little turtle shot out toward the Bai Clan elders.</p><br/><p>However, one of the four elders performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, summoning the image of a palm which shot toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Without even thinking about it, Bai Xiaochun reflexively shoved the Giant Ghost King out in front of him to defend himself. Rumbling sounds could be heard as the enormous palm fell to pieces, and Bai Xiaochun staggered backward. As for the Giant Ghost King, he felt like cursing, but instead, gritted his teeth and endured the pain.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot hurt?\u201d Bai Xiaochun muttered in surprise. The Bai Clan elder was similarly shocked. He had noticed that Bai Xiaochun was dragging an old man with him, but hadn\u2019t paid it much attention. But now, he realized that this old man was clearly extraordinary; a Nascent Soul-level attack which would have injured Bai Xiaochun didn't faze the old man at all.... In fact, he didn\u2019t even cough up any blood.</p><br/><p>Ecstatic, Bai Xiaochun hefted his Eternal Parasol in one hand and the Giant Ghost King in the other, and then charged forward again. As of this moment, the Giant Ghost King was a human shield which Bai Xiaochun could use to block any of the divine abilities being sent his way. The cultivators from the Bai Clan were all shocked.</p><br/><p>Eventually, the Giant Ghost King couldn\u2019t take it any longer. He was trembling, and his ashen face was now turning livid with rage. He had just sustained ten Nascent Soul-level attacks, all backed with deadly intent. Unable to hold back his humiliation at being treated like a human shield, he began to curse!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

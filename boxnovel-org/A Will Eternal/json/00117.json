The south bank has been infiltrated!\u201d</p><br/><p>Frigidsect\u2019s eyes shone with a cold light. He well knew that damaging the spell formation could be done easily, but that repairing it was the opposite. It was like a flower vase. Even a child could smash it, but only a professional, a grandmaster, would be able to put it back together!</p><br/><p>\u201cInfiltrated....\u201d Frigidsect thought for a moment, then reached out toward Mount Daoseed and made a grasping motion. A moment later, a jade slip flew toward him and came to rest in his hand. Within were well-kept records of everything that had occurred in the sect during the past thirty years. That included all of the information about Bai Xiaochun, complete with accounts detailing the lightning, the acid rain, and the pill concocting incident in 10,000 Snakes Valley.</p><br/><p>After examining it, a strange expression appeared on his face. From the look of things, Bai Xiaochun seemed like a walking disaster.... However, it only took a moment for Frigidsect\u2019s eyes to glitter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis kid\u2019s pill concocting... it\u2019s vile....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dao of medicine has myriad paths,\u201d the monkey murmured in response, \u201ca different version for everyone. Perhaps this Bai Xiaochun can\u2026. Fine. Give him the pill formula for the River-Defying Pill, as well as the Frigid School Medicine Manual. Perhaps he actually has a chance to concoct... the River-Defying Pill....\u201d</p><br/><p>Frigidsect\u2019s eyes widened. The River-Defying Pill hadn\u2019t been successfully concocted by anyone in the Spirit Stream Sect during the past 10,000 years. The Spirit Stream Sect had even sought aid from the Pill Stream Sect, and paid handsomely, but to no avail.</p><br/><p>The River-Defying Pill was nothing more than a legend at this point. If it weren\u2019t for the fact that the Spirit Stream Sect still happened to possess a single River-Defying Pill, Frigidsect might not even believe it was possible to concoct it. It was a medicine that had only one function... to awaken the true spirit! Awaken the true spirit for ten breaths of time!</p><br/><p>As for the Frigid School Medicine Manual, it was one of the three great foundation legacies of the Frigid School Spirit Society, which contained a great Dao of medicine that supposedly came from an outside world.</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, Frigidsect nodded. \u201cHis pill concocting methods are vile, and the River-Defying Pill is a vile medicinal pill. Perhaps... he has a shot at concocting it! Master, what about your cultivation base...?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt won't be recovered easily. I need time. Now that I\u2019m back, I have to continue to endure for a few more years. I want to personally see... the destruction of the Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect!\u201d The monkey\u2019s eyes flickered with animosity. Many years ago, he had watched his entire sect wiped out, with him being the only survivor. After passing through numerous areas forbidden to spirits, he barely managed to make it to the eastern river delta.</p><br/><p>\u201cApprentice, I am not the only one to have returned. Other old-timers might also be back. I'm not sure why, but I have the feeling... that a new age might be upon us.\u201d</p><br/><p>The monkey sighed, and Frigidsect stood there silently. Although they were both ancient, their spirits burned hot, and they were completely focused.</p><br/><p>Time passed. A month later, Bai Xiaochun had just finished a cultivation session in the cave. He wanted to go out, but knew that he couldn\u2019t. Sighing, he continued to do breathing exercises.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he opened his eyes, and before he could take another breath, realized that a jade slip and a bamboo scroll were laying there in front of him.</p><br/><p>They looked extremely ancient, as though they had existed for countless years. They almost seemed to radiate a primeval air.</p><br/><p>\u201cEee?\u201d After looking a bit closer, he picked up the jade slip and poured some spiritual power into it. After a moment, his eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>\u201cRiver-Defying Pill? It doesn\u2019t need any plants or vegetation, only water from the Heavenspan River? What.. what kind of medicinal pill is this? It looks pretty incredible. Who ever thought that you could concoct medicinal pills from Heavenspan River water?\u201d After examining the concoction method a bit further, he gasped.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow vile! You actually have to use your body as a pill furnace....\u201d Next, he looked over at the bamboo scroll, and his eyes went even wider.</p><br/><p>\u201cFrigid School Medicine Manual?</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and opened the bamboo scroll. None of it made any sense to him. Only the first line of text was clear, and yet, even that little bit was enough to drive Bai Xiaochun mad. \u201cImmortality begins with the Frigid School; Eternal life ends the cycle of reincarnation!</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me... don\u2019t tell me that this medicine manual can be used to concoct a Live-Forever Never-Die Pill!? AHHHHHHHH!\u201d He couldn\u2019t hold back the shriek that echoed out of his mouth. His eyes were as bloodshot as if he had just obtained the most precious of treasures.</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother Sect Leader must have noticed how hard I've been working at my cultivation, and decided to give me a reward. You're so awesome, Elder Brother Sect Leader. This River-Defying Pill is a mere trifle. Once I\u2019m a bit stronger, I\u2019ll concoct a thousand of them for you.\u201d Looking very excited, he continued to study the Frigid School Medicine Manual. Although he couldn\u2019t see any of the other information inside, he was already obsessed with it.</p><br/><p>After studying it for a while, he realized that the bamboo which had been used to make the scroll emanated an ancient aura which had to be over 10,000 years old.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t even sure how bamboo could survive for so long. On top of that, it contained a sweet aroma that caused his cultivation base to rotate rapidly after inhaling it.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun only continued to get more excited, and was even more certain that this was a very precious item. In fact, he even started to wonder if his diligent cultivation really had attracted the attention of the sect leader, or whether it was the spirit of his Master, bestowing gifts upon him from the underworld.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not very likely....\u201d he thought. Gritting his teeth, he stopped thinking about it. After all, the treasure was in his hands now, so it belonged to him.</p><br/><p>What he didn\u2019t notice was that behind him, deeper in the cave, was a monkey, standing there looking at him with reverence in its eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust how did he do it...?\u201d thought the monkey. \u201cDid some mysterious entity really guide his hands to bring me back...?\u201d</p><br/><p>After some time passed, the monkey turned and merged into the stone wall of the cave. There, he sank down through the mountain... until he was deep beneath the bank of the river.</p><br/><p>He found himself in an enormous subterranean cavern. Down below flowed the golden waters of the Heavenspan River, and an enormous spell formation filled the entire cavern. This spell formation was the nucleus of the entire Spirit Stream Sect.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t an offensive spell formation, it was solely... defensive.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the golden river water was a coffin.</p><br/><p>It had no cover, and visible inside of it... was the corpse of a baby girl.</p><br/><p>Despite being a corpse, the girl seemed to contain signs of life, as well as a profoundly ancient air....</p><br/><p>Two months flashed by.</p><br/><p>Although Bai Xiaochun was frustrated that he couldn\u2019t understand any of the Frigid School Medicine Manual, he refused to give up, and was sure that once his medicine concocting skill improved, he would understand.</p><br/><p>Now that his punishment was over, he emerged from the cave in high spirits. His cultivation base had even advanced a bit. Soon, he received notice that he would be sent to the north bank to observe a host of beasts and improve his Waterswamp Kingdom.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe north bank....\u201d Shocked, he looked north and thought about the Chosen battles, and how he had been named the archenemy of the north bank. After a moment of hesitation, he murmured, \u201cAh, it's been so long, everybody probably forgot about that already.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t seem very confident in that analysis, there was nothing he could do about the matter. After thinking about it a bit longer, his eyes began to shine with anticipation. After all, his bag of holding still contained that Beastbirth Seed, and the thought of being able to finally have his own beast made the idea of going to the north bank more tolerable.</p><br/><p>After returning to Fragrant Cloud Peak, he went to his destroyed immortal's cave to pack his bags. Three days later, he stood there on Mount Daoseed, surrounded by the elders, peak lords, Inner Sect disciples, and quite a group of Outer Sect disciples, all of whom were there to see him off.</p><br/><p>They had all come of their own volition. Only by personally witnessing Bai Xiaochun go to the north bank could they finally rest at ease.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was moved to see that so many people had come to see them off. As he stood there next to the sect leader, he waved his hand in farewell.</p><br/><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, fellow disciples, I\u2019m going to the north bank, and I shall miss all of you! I shall miss the south bank, and I shall miss all of the plants and vegetation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Strange looks appeared on the faces of those present. After all, this was a somber farewell. Even the sect leader and the peak lords were present. Although most of the disciples were still angry with Bai Xiaochun, they still tried to look as though they didn\u2019t want him to go.</p><br/><p>The only people who truly felt bad were Big Fatty Zhang, Hou Xiaomei, and Hou Yunfei, along with a few other people he was truly close to. However, the south and north banks were both part of the Spirit Stream Sect, so the feelings weren\u2019t overwhelming.</p><br/><p>Elder Zhou walked out from the crowd and looked warmly at Bai Xiaochun. \u201cJunior Brother Bai, you have spectacular talent, and are just beginning to make headway with the Waterswamp Kingdom. Don\u2019t try to convince us you aren\u2019t set on pulling off a miracle, and succeed in cultivating it. The north bank has better resources than we do here on the south bank. Continuing your cultivation there will be much better for you in the long run. In fact, you\u2019ll have an even greater chance of reaching Foundation Establishment there. When that happens, your longevity will increase.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun shivered, and his eyes shone with delight at the idea of reaching Foundation Establishment and increasing his longevity.</p><br/><p>Soon, others began to call out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s time to leave. Turn, and walk over to the north bank. We cultivators are always moving forward, never going backward. There\u2019s no need to look behind. Simply strive onward!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right, Sect Uncle Bai. It\u2019s time to leave. With dreams as big as yours, the north bank really is the only place where you can spread your wings and soar!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Uncle Bai, there\u2019s no need for you to miss us here, and once you get to the north bank, there\u2019s no need to come back. Your path is always in front of you!\u201d Upon hearing such words, Bai Xiaochun felt even more moved.</p><br/><p>Taking a breath, he clasped hands and bowed deeply to everyone. The sect leader looked on with an odd expression until Bai Xiaochun turned, and the two of them headed toward the north bank....</p><br/><p>After he was gone, the warm expression on Elder Zhou\u2019s face turned into one of excitement, and it was the same with the surrounding disciples. Many people were so happy they started crying.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe heavens do have eyes! Bai Xiaochun is finally gone!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahahahahaha! The sect leader has bestowed favor upon us! The peak lords are wise and magnanimous! The Dao of the heavens truly is just! Spring has finally arrived for the south bank!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this real? Is Bai Xiaochun finally gone!? Do I dare to believe that it's true?\u201d Everyone began to cheer, and some people even took out drums and cymbals and began banging and clashing them loudly.</p><br/><p>On the north side of Mount Daoseed, Bai Xiaochun trailed behind the sect leader as they walked along. When he heard the racket behind him, he cleared his throat, and a strange expression appeared on his face. Something about the whole situation seemed familiar. He sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you hear that, Elder Brother Sect Leader? The south bank misses me so much that my departure has sent them wild with grief.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zheng Yuandong\u2019s jaw dropped, and he looked up quietly into the sky....</p><br/>\n</div>"}

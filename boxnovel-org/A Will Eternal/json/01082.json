He had heard of Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a before. The town that Bai Xiaochun had stayed in for a time in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty had been in the immortal domain overseen by him.</p><br/><p>Later, Ghostmother took over that immortal domain. If things had not suddenly changed, it would likely have been Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a that he tangled with. And considering the level of his cultivation base at the time, it would have been difficult for Bai Xiaochun to kidnap him.</p><br/><p>The man was built like a tower, and as he stood there, intense pressure radiated off of him that caused the pupils of Gu Tianjun and Sima Yunhua to constrict.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Vile-Emperor Dynasty sent three celestials\u2026?\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought, blinking a few times. \u201cI guess they could only send six in total.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clearly, the two emperors had come to an agreement about how many people to send.</p><br/><p>Even as Bai Xiaochun considered the matter, Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a looked over at him. Then, he spoke in a cold voice that demanded answers from anyone who heard it.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you that useless stray dog Bai Xiaochun?\u201d</p><br/><p>From the way the man singled him out, Bai Xiaochun could tell that he had nothing but ill intentions toward him. Furthermore, it seemed highly likely that he hoped to start a conflict that would escalate into an actual fight.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, why would he be so overtly insulting?</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes he really want to attack me physically? Maybe use me to put pressure on everyone else?\u201d Alarmed, he tried to decide what to do. Before he could, Prince Ur-Demon stepped forward and looked at Bai Xiaochun, his eyes shining with strange light.</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard that the secret of spirit enhancement is locked inside the blood of the people of Heavenspan. Do you mind\u2026 giving me some of your blood to taste?\u201d Bai Xiaochun sucked in a breath. First Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a started causing problems, and now this clearly villainous Prince Ur-Demon was joining in. Bai Xiaochun already had a bad feeling.</p><br/><p>And yet, before that bad feeling could even begin to fade, Reverend Devourer chuckled hoarsely, looked at Bai Xiaochun, and then licked his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm curious, not only about spirit enhancement, but also the unique flame conjuring techniques of the lands of Heavenspan. Supposedly you use souls as the main ingredient. I asked around, Bai Xiaochun, and everyone said that you are the only heavenly necromancer to ever exist.\u201d A greedy gleam flickered within Reverend Devourer\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>At this point, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart was pounding harder than ever, and his scalp was tingling like mad. With the vicious-looking Reverend Devourer in the mix, he now had three celestials all focused on him!</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! I haven\u2019t even gotten to say anything! I was trying to keep a low profile! I didn\u2019t provoke any of these lunatics, and yet they\u2019re already teaming up to target me?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was nervous, and scared about being in such a passive position. Glancing over at Gu Tianjun and Sima Yunhua, he could see that they were obviously not going to back him up.</p><br/><p>From their perspective, this was the perfect opportunity to see what Bai Xiaochun\u2019s battle prowess was like now that he had broken through and become a celestial.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s anxiety mounted when he realized what they were thinking. Although he was scrambling to try to decide what to do, only a few breaths of time had passed so far. Seeing the three celestials all staring at him, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and stepped forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to put everything on the line,\u201d he thought. \u201cI can\u2019t be scared. In fact, I need to strike fear into <em>their</em> hearts. How to do it, though? If they join forces, the probably won't kill me, but would beat me up pretty badly. I guess one upside to this place is that neither divine sense nor ordinary senses work well in this place. I can\u2019t see anything about their level, but they can\u2019t see anything about mine either.\u201d Inwardly anxious, he threw his head back and laughed uproariously. Flicking his sleeve, he stared at the other celestials, battle spirit flickering in his eyes, as well as a bit of derision.</p><br/><p>Sneering, he said, \u201cIt's been a long time since anyone has dared to say such things in my presence.\u201d</p><br/><p>He almost seemed to regret that fact, as though he were thinking back to wonderful things from when he was younger.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow that I think about it, the last person who said something like that to me was another celestial from the Vile-Emperor Dynasty. Who was it? Oh, right. Ghostmother.\u201d Chuckling, and seemingly thrumming with battle spirit, he looked at the three celestials, pursing his lips as if to suppress his laughter. Although his heart was racing with anxiety, his eyes shone with utter madness.</p><br/><p>\u201cI've been restraining myself for some time now,\u201d he sighed. \u201cI\u2019d hoped to keep a low profile here in the Eternal Immortal Domains, but, ah, whatever\u2026. Come on. I\u2019ll let one of you to try to make me cough up some blood. If even a drop comes out, then you can keep it!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s words, his eyes flickered with cold light. Smiling viciously, he blurred into motion, placing himself right in front of Bai Xiaochun, upon whom he unleashed a fist strike.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn't even attempt to dodge. He knew that he had to strike fear into the hearts of these three celestials from the Vile-Emperor City. If he tried to evade this strike, or fought back, the three of them would surely team up on him.</p><br/><p>As for the damned Gu Tianjun and Sima Yunhua, they seemed content to just watch the excitement. Unless they were personally threatened, they wouldn't do anything to stop it. There was no time for thought or planning. However, he didn\u2019t need to. He had long since donned numerous layers of leather armor, beneath which lurked his turtle-wok\u2026.</p><br/><p>He had been prepared from the very beginning to dodge if the fist strike wasn\u2019t aimed at his torso.</p><br/><p>But it was, and therefore, Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a\u2019s fist, which let out a string of sonic booms as it closed in, slammed directly into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s chest!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t even attempt to move out of the way, causing the eyes of all five of the other celestials to widen.</p><br/><p>And of course, there was no need to even mention the reaction of all the other cultivators present. When the fist landed, Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t move. A huge boom rang out, and much of his leather armor was destroyed, but he himself was not harmed. Not even a drop of blood oozed out of his mouth.</p><br/><p>In sharp contrast, the towering, burly Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a grunted in pain. To him, it felt as though he had struck an immovable mountain. An indescribably powerful backlash hit him with devastating force, shattering his hand and sending him staggering backward several paces, blood oozing out of his mouth. His five yin organs and six yang organs vibrated dangerously, and his eyes widened as surely as if he had seen a terrifying ghost.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow is this even possible!?!?\u201d Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a blurted in shock. \u201cYou just became a celestial! Even if you have a strong fleshly body, you shouldn't be able to stand up to a strike like that! You must have some precious treasure, don\u2019t you!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately for him, he couldn\u2019t use his divine sense, and therefore had no way to even look for clues to figure out what had just occurred.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo weak!\u201d Bai Xiaochun sneered. \u201cDon\u2019t you have any defensive precious treasures to protect you from measly backlashes?!\u201d The madness in his eyes seemed to flare brightly, and he even laughed in joy. That joy was actually real. After all, thanks to his terrifying powers of regeneration, the wounds that he had received moments ago were already healed. As for the turtle-wok, although it was easy to absorb back into his body, it could not be brought back out again so easily.</p><br/><p>Looking very proud, he ripped off the tattered remnants of his leather armor and tossed them off to the side. Taking a confident step forward, he looked at the confused Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a and then laughed maniacally.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on. Bring it on! Hit me again!\u201d He took a few more threatening steps toward Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a, who backed up without even thinking about it. His right hand was completely destroyed, which meant that unless he called upon a unique celestial Daoist magic, there was no way he could do anything to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fleshly body power, which seemed like a defensive treasure. Ordinary magical techniques and fleshly body power would be useless against him.</p><br/><p>And the horrific backlash had Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a shaking in fear.</p><br/><p>Seeing that his opponent was backing up, Bai Xiaochun laughed madly. Waving his arm dismissively, he turned to Prince Ur-Demon and Reverend Devourer.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re Prince Ur-Demon, right? Want some of my blood? Well, come on. Hit me and get some!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd what about you, Reverend Devourer? Come on, hit me. Hurry up! Hit me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Prince Ur-Demon: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Reverend Devourer: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

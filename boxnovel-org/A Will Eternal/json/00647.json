He even rolled his eyes; as far as he was concerned, there wasn\u2019t anything that could possibly be more important than his poor little life.</p><br/><p>Outside in the city, the three great clans were going crazy searching for the Giant Ghost King\u2019s true self, which meant that this was a very critical moment for Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>The chief of the Bai Clan would definitely take advantage of the chaos to try to kill him....</p><br/><p>In a moment like this, Bai Xiaochun was in no mood to think about making money. That was especially true considering it was the little turtle who had suggested it. Over the years, the little turtle had caused one troublesome incident after another, so at the moment, Bai Xiaochun simply ignored him and hurried along with the captain, worried that he might not be able to get out of the prison in time.</p><br/><p>Everyone in Devil Penitentiary was completely on edge. Guards and prisoners alike were rushing toward the entrance of the cellblock.</p><br/><p>At this point, the little turtle anxiously flew out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s bag of holding and landed on his shoulder.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cAi, don\u2019t be like that!\u201d he transmitted. \u201cI'm talking about a lot of money here, the kind of opportunity that only comes around once in a blue moon. It\u2019s right here in front of us! Come on, don\u2019t leave, ya little punk!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked over at the little turtle and could see that he seemed really anxious. The turtle glanced behind them and then urgently continued to transmit his voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, listen punk, I know where the Giant Ghost King\u2019s true self is!!\u201d Originally, the little turtle had planned to use a different tactic to try to attract Bai Xiaochun\u2019s attention. However, considering that Bai Xiaochun was clearly intent on leaving, he felt he didn\u2019t have any other choice than to tell the truth. Furthermore, he was sure that this new revelation would provoke a response.</p><br/><p>And he was right. This time, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s reaction was more in line with what the turtle had expected.\u00a0</p><br/><p>A tremor ran through him, and his eyes went wide as he said, \u201cWhat!?!?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>This turn of events was too sudden! The three great clans were turning the city upside down to look for the Giant Ghost King\u2019s true self, and yet the little turtle actually knew where he was?</p><br/><p>Despite his shock, though, Bai Xiaochun continued to head toward the entrance of the cellblock.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does that have to do with me?\u201d he transmitted back. \u201cYou listen here, little turtle, the most important thing right now is my poor little life. You got that?!\u201d As far as Bai Xiaochun was concerned, getting involved in this matter between the Giant Ghost King and the three great clans would be far too dangerous.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing!?\u201d the little turtle replied anxiously. \u201cListen to me, ya little punk. Slow down! Ah, fine... listen, Bai Xiaochun. You know the old guy in the cell right across from you, with the red birthmark on his face? That\u2019s the Giant Ghost King\u2019s true self!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind reeled in shock, and he even gasped. A look of complete and utter incredulity appeared on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s... <em>he\u2019s</em> the Giant Ghost King?!?!?!\u201d Even his aura was destabilized a bit. This bit of information from the little turtle was completely shocking. All of a sudden, the thought back to what that old man with the red birthmark on his face looked like.</p><br/><p>\u201cFurthermore, Lord Turtle can tell that Giant Ghost King is in the middle of a decay period. In other words, he\u2019s weaker now than ever before. The chance to clean out a demigod expert is the kind of thing that only comes along once in 10,000 years!</p><br/><p>\u201cThink about it, punk. A demigod expert! He\u2019s the Giant Ghost King! A demigod king! How much treasure do you think he has!? If we clean him out, we\u2019ll be ultra rich! This opportunity... heavens! I\u2019ve only come across chances like this a couple times in my entire life! Y-y-you... you can\u2019t really be planning to just run away?!?!\u201d By this point, the little turtle was so anxious his voice was transmitted in the form of a shout. Fearful of losing the opportunity, he had actually revealed everything he knew.</p><br/><p>Sensing that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s interest was piqued, the little turtle\u2019s excitement began to grow.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s the Giant Ghost King, little punk!\u201d he gushed. \u201cWe can clean him out! Clean him out!! <em>Clean him out!!!\u201d</em></p><br/><p>\u201cHow is that even possible...?\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought, stopping in place, his heart beginning to race.</p><br/><p>The captain and the other guards looked back in shock, various expressions flashing across their faces.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat's wrong, Bai Hao?\u201d the captain said anxiously. \u201cHurry up, let\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait just one moment....\u201d Bai Xiaochun said.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Feeling very conflicted, he transmitted a question to the little turtle. \u201cAre you sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little turtle was trembling with indescribable excitement, and also trying to look as impressive and incredible as possible as he replied, \u201cOf course I'm sure. I\u2019ve been keeping my eye on the Giant Ghost King from the first time I saw him. Why do you think I woke up back then anyway? I could tell what was going on as soon as I saw him, and was just waiting until his decay period hit!</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! This is the moment I've been waiting for. At the most, he's at Core Formation right now. Listen, there\u2019s nothing to worry about. The Giant Ghost King is a crafty fellow. Nobody would ever possibly think that he would actually be hiding as a prisoner in this place. It\u2019s just too bad that he ran into Lord Turtle!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun thought back to what the little turtle had said back when he woke up\u2026 that the Giant Ghost King\u00a0<em>smelled like treasure</em>....</p><br/><p>\u201cThis little turtle....\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought, his heart beginning to race even faster, and his eyes beginning to shine. If he had really found the Giant Ghost King\u2019s true self, and the man was currently weak, then just as the little turtle had said, it would be an incredible opportunity. The benefits of cleaning him out... would be difficult to even describe.</p><br/><p>In fact, it could also be a secret weapon to cause some problems for the three great clans.... Of course, whether it was simply robbing him, or using his status in a clever way, both would be very dangerous.</p><br/><p>Even when Bai Xiaochun got very excited, he wouldn\u2019t lose his sense of reason. Hesitating, he said, \u201cThe Giant Ghost King is a demigod. Even though he\u2019s hiding here, he definitely would have some trump cards prepared to defend himself just in case.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, his trump card is none other than the invisible spell formation in the stone turtle that contains Devil Penitentiary. Once that spell formation is activated, it will be almost as strong as the Demigod Realm. Devas would be able to break through it, but not right away!</p><br/><p>\u201cUnfortunately for the Giant Ghost King, he was just unlucky enough to run into Lord Turtle. Hahaha! I wouldn\u2019t dare to speak about any other spell formation, but this is a turtle spell formation. Lord Turtle can\u2019t control it, but I can nullify its effects, at least temporarily. In fact, I already did! Come on, let\u2019s clean him out. We\u2019ll definitely succeed!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe's a demigod, he definitely has a bunch of treasure on him.\u201d The little turtle\u2019s eyes were shining with unprecedented excitement, and he was shaking visibly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWill he have a deva soul?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, his eyes bloodshot. The fact that a demigod king was right there waiting to be grabbed caused even him to start to go a bit crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course!\u201d the little turtle screeched. \u201cTo you, deva souls are priceless, but demigods can get them without even trying. Hurry up! Let\u2019s just grab him and get out of the turtle statue. I can only keep the spell formation suppressed for so long. Once my control slips and the Giant Ghost King is able to control it again, we\u2019ll be in great danger!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and looked over at the captain and other guards, who were anxiously waiting for him to speak. Gritting his teeth, he said, \u201cCaptain, you go on ahead. But please give me the key to the cells. There\u2019s a guy back there who pissed me off, and I want to teach him a lesson before I leave.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>With that, Bai Xiaochun clasped hands and bowed deeply.</p><br/><p>At any other time, the captain would never have been able to agree to this request. But considering everyone was completely on edge, he looked at Bai Xiaochun for a moment, and then sighed and said, \u201cAlright, Brother Bai Hao, you\u2019re on your own now. We\u2019ll take off now.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Naturally, the captain could tell that Bai Hao had some secret he wasn\u2019t willing to divulge. However, that didn\u2019t matter. Even if Bai Hao wanted to kill one of the prisoners, it wouldn't matter in the end. The captain tossed a command medallion over to him, then turned and left with the other guards.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun grabbed the command medallion that acted as the key to the cells, then adjusted his aura and settled his thoughts. He knew that if he slipped up in the slightest way right now, he could get into a lot of trouble.</p><br/><p>But his decision was made. Gritting his teeth, he began to speed toward the cell that contained the old man with the red birthmark on his face. Along the way, he had a short transmitted conversation with the little turtle to confirm that the old man was in the Core Formation stage.</p><br/><p>However, he was still feeling nervous. Although the little turtle didn\u2019t notice, he looked up in thought for a moment. Then he lowered his voice and said, \u201cNo, little turtle, it\u2019s too dangerous. He\u2019s a demigod! If you\u2019re wrong about everything, nothing will happen to you. You could escape any time you wanted. But I would lose my poor little life. You fly over into my hand. That way, if the situation gets dangerous, we can face it together! If we\u2019re going to clean out a demigod together, you need to show some good faith!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

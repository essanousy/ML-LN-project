There were three powers within the Eternal Immortal Domains!</p><br/><p>Things had gone back to the way they were originally intended. Although the Arch-Emperor Dynasty arrived on the scene late in the game\u2026 it had still come!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was very pleased to have become the Arch-Emperor, and that he could now boss everyone around. Of course, he quickly came to find that although he did have the authority to issue orders, when it came to governing the nation, the Grand Heavenmaster was far more adept than him.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, every time he made public appearances, it caused a huge stir. Considering how busy everyone was, Bai Xiaochun finally sighed and decided that the best thing was for him to simply be the spiritual leader of the nation.</p><br/><p>Besides, he didn\u2019t care much for governmental power. He didn\u2019t even care that the Grand Heavenmaster had once run a very similar puppet government back in the Wildlands. After all, as long as his cultivation base was high enough, nobody would be able to take away what was his.</p><br/><p>Now that the Arch-Emperor Dynasty had been officially founded in the Eternal Lands, more and more Heavenspan Realm cultivators came to join it. Soon, a peace descended upon them the likes of which they had not enjoyed for a very long time. As things developed, the bellies of Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo grew larger.</p><br/><p>The Grand Heavenmaster, Li Qinghou and others of the senior generation were much more concerned about matters such as that than Bai Xiaochun was, and devoted many resources to keeping the two women safe.</p><br/><p>Their residences were strictly guarded, and numerous precautions were taken to ensure that no accidents happened. As for Bai Xiaochun, he was no longer bored and idle; he spent every day with Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo, helping to take care of them, and enjoying a warm tenderness that had been lacking for a long time.</p><br/><p>The only awkward thing was that having multiple Daoist partners was actually quite a headache. Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo were both very proud, and had short tempers. And they were even more emotional than normal. The glares they cast at each other nearly led to fighting on a few occasions, leaving Bai Xiaochun very jumpy and nervous.</p><br/><p>And when Hou Xiaomei saw all of this happening, she got even more irritated than before. The more she thought about the situation, the less she seemed willing to accept it, until she secretly met with Li Qinghou to ask for his help\u2026.</p><br/><p>Li Qinghou was like a father to Bai Xiaochun, which put him in a very unique position within the Arch-Emperor Dynasty. All of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Daoist partners truly respected him.</p><br/><p>Although Song Junwan didn\u2019t visit him on a daily basis, she would dine with him every few days. Even the stubborn and obstinate Zhou Zimo would take time to go see him.</p><br/><p>However, between the three daughters-in-law that Li Qinghou had, he liked Hou Xiaomei the best. After all, she had started out in the Spirit Stream Sect, under his command as the peak lord of Fragrant Cloud Peak. Li Qinghou had essentially watched Bai Xiaochun and Hou Xiaomei grow up together.</p><br/><p>After hearing Hou Xiaomei\u2019s frustrations, Li Qinghou thought the matter over, then sighed. He made some inquiries, and soon learned that Bai Xiaochun had ended up together with Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo by means of his Aphrodisiac Pills.</p><br/><p>One particular day after Bai Xiaochun had just gone to spend some time with Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo, he returned to his grand hall, and had just sat down when Li Qinghou entered.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Li!\u201d he said, instantly rising to his feet and rushing over to him. It didn\u2019t matter that he was the Arch-Emperor now, to him, Li Qinghou would always be like a father.</p><br/><p>Li Qinghou was very pleased with how things had turned out for Bai Xiaochun. He would often think back to that boy he had seen on top of Mount Hood, lighting an incense stick. Step by step, he had reached this point, and Li Qinghou couldn\u2019t have been prouder.</p><br/><p>The two of them sat down to reminisce, with Li Qinghou giving occasional bits of advice. It didn\u2019t matter what he said, Bai Xiaochun would always nod in agreement. After the time it takes an incense stick to burn, Li Qinghou cleared his throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cSay, Xiaochun\u2026 do you have any more Aphrodisiac Pills?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d Bai Xiaochun blurted. He had assumed that his Uncle Li had come here for some specific reason, and here it was. After blinking a few times, Bai Xiaochun slapped his thigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve taken a liking to someone, haven\u2019t you, Uncle Li? Who is it?\u201d He was actually very curious about this point. Of course, Li Qinghou had always been fond of Big Fatty Zhang\u2019s Master, Xu Meixiang. Unfortunately, she had gone missing, and even after most of the people of the Heavenspan Realm were now gathering back together, she was nowhere to be found. <span id=\"footnote-ref-fca0\">[1]</span></p><br/><p>Glaring in embarrassment, Li Qinghou said, \u201cThere\u2019s no reason to flip out! If you have any, I\u2019ll just take one!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cIf anybody else had asked me for one, Uncle Li, I would say I'm out. But since it's you, here you go!\u201d Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but smile at how Li Qinghou seemed to be having a youthful reinvigoration. The truth was that he didn\u2019t have many Aphrodisiac Pills left. Furthermore, after what had happened with Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo, he was very cautious when it came to Aphrodisiac Pills. Taking out a bottle, he offered it to Li Qinghou.</p><br/><p>Chuckling knowingly, Bai Xiaochun looked at Li Qinghou and said, \u201cUncle Li, you\u2019re getting old, and you need to look out for your health. These things\u2026 well, don\u2019t overdose, okay? That bottle has eight pills and--\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCut the crap!\u201d Li Qinghou said coldly, grabbing the pill bottle.</p><br/><p>\u201cI get it, I get it. You\u2019re a bit shy, so you need some really strong stuff. Hahaha! I understand.\u201d Bai Xiaochun was truly amused by the whole situation, and couldn\u2019t hold back from laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlthough, if you\u2019ve taken a liking to someone, Uncle Li, you really don\u2019t need to use something like that medicine\u2026. You just need to figure out how to woo her! Let me teach you.\u201d Thumping himself on the chest, he said, \u201cTrust me, I'm not bragging when I say that I--\u201d \u00a0</p><br/><p>At this point, Li Qinghou couldn\u2019t take it anymore. Glaring at Bai Xiaochun, he turned and left.</p><br/><p>Chuckling, Bai Xiaochun called out, \u201cDon\u2019t forget, Uncle Li, don\u2019t actually consume that pill. Just a bit of powder from it will do fine. Don\u2019t overdose!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before walking out the door, Li Qinghou paused, looked over his shoulder, and looked meaningfully at Bai Xiaochun. Then he nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust some powder!\u201d Bai Xiaochun repeated. \u201cUnderstand!?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that point, he suddenly felt like there was something odd about the whole situation. There had been something in Li Qinghou\u2019s eyes right before he left that seemed to indicate that there was more to the story\u2026.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t think of what that might possibly be. \u201cUncle Li is a great guy, just a bit shy, that's all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking about what it would be like when Li Qinghou used the Aphrodisiac Pill, Bai Xiaochun began to hum a little tune and head back to his throne.</p><br/><p>That evening\u2026.</p><br/><p>Hou Xiaomei walked briskly through the imperial palace, trying to keep her breathing steady. She had two Aphrodisiac Pills, one in each hand, and she was continuously reminding herself of what Li Qinghou had told her.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to crush them. I have to crush them\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eventually, she reached Bai Xiaochun\u2019s private chamber. Taking a moment to compose herself, she looked up, a smile on her face that made her look as beautiful as a freshly bloomed flower.</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you here, Big Bro Xiaochun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was in the middle of meditating. When he heard Hou Xiaomei\u2019s voice, he quickly opened the door of the chamber and saw her standing there, bathed in moonlight.</p><br/><p>He was surprised to see her. After all, this was the first time she had come to visit him after returning.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaomei, you--\u201d Before he could even finish his sentence, she blinked a few times and then walked into the private chamber. As she did, she squeezed her fists!</p><br/><p>Two popping sounds then rang out within the chamber.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was that sound? Seemed really familiar\u2026.\u201d It was at that point that a pink mist began to spread out\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2026 that was\u2026 an Aphrodisiac Pill?!?!\u201d His eyes went wide, and he backed up. But that was when a soft, warm body wrapped around him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow did you get an Aphrodisiac Pill?!?!\u201d Even as his vision turned pink, he heard Hou Xiaomei\u2019s captivating voice whispering in his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Li gave it to me.\u201d At that point, Bai Xiaochun fell down onto his back, and the entire room filled with pink mist.</p><div id=\"footnote-fca0\"><br/><p>1. Right in the middle of this paragraph is a completely random sentence that explains that Big Fatty Zhang went into secluded cultivation to advance his cultivation base, which he thinks is too low. Honestly, that passage completely breaks the flow of this particular scene, so I'm just including the information here as a footnote <i class=\"fa fa-hand-o-left\"></i></p></div><br/>\n</div>"}

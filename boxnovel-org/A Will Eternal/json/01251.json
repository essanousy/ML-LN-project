The floor tiles, chairs, tables, candles, and everything else that could be taken away was soon gone.</p><br/><p>In the end, it was nothing more than an empty shell, and Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart was pounding as he thought of the gains he had made.</p><br/><p>Of course, he didn\u2019t forget the delicious food and fine wine. After scanning the entire area with divine sense, he found that whatever race of people had once existed here had plenty of hidden reserves. Licking his lips, he took it all, and then scanned the surrounding ruins one last time to make sure he hadn\u2019t missed anything.</p><br/><p>Feeling very pleased, he returned to the fan to find Bai Xiaochi waiting for him, an envious look on his face. Without any further ado, they turned the fan and headed off into the distance. By this point, the brothel\u2019s spell formation wasn\u2019t working anymore, and therefore, they easily escaped the area.</p><br/><p>As the fan flew through the void, and as Bai Xiaochun sat there cross-legged, continuing to work on the formula for thirty-colored flame, court was being held back in the Arch-Emperor Dynasty in the Eternal Immortal Domains!</p><br/><p>During times when Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t present, matters of national concern were handled by Zhou Zimo, Song Junwan, Hou Xiaomei, the Grand Heavenmaster, the Giant Ghost King, Li Qinghou, and Gongsun Wan\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Dabao had long since grown up, and acted his part as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heir. He wasn\u2019t impulsive and belligerent like he had been when he was young, although his fundamental personality hadn\u2019t changed. As far as his cultivation base went, he had made shocking progress, and was already in the Demigod Realm!</p><br/><p>In terms of fleshly body, even the Giant Ghost King had to admit that his grandson was probably the toughest person he had ever met, other than Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Xiaoxiao\u2019s cultivation base was a bit higher than Dabao\u2019s. However, she had spent most her time in recent years in secluded meditation.</p><br/><p>With more and more celestials, the Arch-Emperor Dynasty\u2019s foundation grew stronger and stronger. However, because it was public knowledge that Bai Xiaochun was in seclusion, rumors began to spread.</p><br/><p>The talk wasn\u2019t heard in the Arch-Emperor Dynasty, but rather, in the Saint-Emperor Dynasty and Vile-Emperor Dynasty. According to the rumors, Bai Xiaochun actually didn\u2019t have archaean-level battle prowess. Instead, he had paid a huge price to come out on top in the conflicts of the past, and as a result, had been forced to spend the time afterward in meditation.</p><br/><p>It was true that he had occasionally come back to spend time with Xiaoxiao, Dabao, and the rest of his family. However, most of his time was spent on his research, and his travels in the void. Sometimes, he would only come back once in an entire year, and wouldn't stay for very long when he did.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe gossip is most abundant in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty,\u201d the Grand Heavenmaster said. \u201cThere is definitely someone intentionally spreading the rumors. If His Majesty doesn\u2019t make a public appearance soon, I fear it will lead to troublesome developments.</p><br/><p>\u201cMost important of all is His Majesty\u2019s cultivation base\u2026.\u201d At the moment, everyone was trying to come up with a plan for what to do next. Bai Xiaochun hadn\u2019t visited for several years now, and no one knew about the fact that he was now an archaean. And because he was so determined to succeed with thirty-colored flame as soon as possible, he hadn\u2019t taken the time to check in on the situation back home.</p><br/><p>Even as everyone in the grand hall frowned and tried to think of good suggestions about what to do, a massive, rumbling boom filled the sky above!</p><br/><p>It sounded like heavenly thunder, and it didn\u2019t just affect the Arch-Emperor Dynasty. The Saint-Emperor Dynasty and Vile-Emperor Dynasty also experienced the same thing\u2026. All of the Eternal Immortal Domains were filled with the deafening sound!</p><br/><p>Massive waves rolled across the Eternal Sea as the entire world shook. At the same time, everyone felt an incredible pressure descending from the heavens!!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! What\u2026 what is that sound!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Countless people all over the world were thrown into alarm. At the same time, the most powerful experts in the three imperial dynasties flew out into the open and looked up into the sky.</p><br/><p>That was the origin of the sound!!</p><br/><p>To everyone\u2019s shock, the enormous sovereign who had existed for countless years without ever moving\u2026 had suddenly moved! His eyes had twitched!!</p><br/><p>All of the powerful experts could sense it, and it immediately caused all of their minds to reel!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe giant moved!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm not seeing things, am I? He\u2026 he actually twitched!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could this be? The legends\u2026 are actually true!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Saint-Emperor and the Vile-Emperor flew out at almost the same time, and hovered above their respective imperial cities. A somber look could be seen in the Saint-Emperor\u2019s eyes, whereas a mysterious glow was visible in the Vile-Emperor\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Even as all of the countless cultivators looked on, hearts pounding with sensations of deadly crisis, the twitching of the enormous sovereign\u2019s eyes caused more than a hundred boulders to dislodge from his forehead, and shoot down toward the Eternal Immortal Domains like meteors!</p><br/><p>They moved with incredible speed, and even seemed to be self-aware. No matter how quickly the Saint-Emperor and the Vile-Emperor reacted, they couldn\u2019t block them all!</p><br/><p>Massive booms echoed out from the ground below from the impacts of those that made it through!</p><br/><p>Without the slightest hesitation, the Saint-Emperor issued orders to his people.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll celestials and all demigods will immediately search the Saint-Emperor Dynasty for those fallen rocks. If any of them seem to be alive, destroy them!\u201d</p><br/><p>Similar orders were passed down in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, except that instead of ordering any living things to be destroyed, they were to be collected.</p><br/><p>Soon, both of the dynasties were fully mobilized. Even the sea areas were not overlooked.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was not present, but the Grand Heavenmaster and other leaders of the Arch-Emperor Dynasty made the same decision as the others, sending celestials and demigods out to search!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun was back on his treasured fan, expression somber as he focused on a bit of fire taking shape in front of him. The transformations occurring within this fire were different than in twenty-nine-colored flame. It was impossible to see the colors within the flame, as though all of the colors had combined together, making the fire transparent!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had already completed the main outline of the formula, and with every test he did, he inched closer to completion.</p><br/><p>Even still, after all of the failures, Bai Xiaochun was starting to come to the conclusion\u2026 that success was not a foregone conclusion. He was perfectly prepared, and completely qualified in terms of experience. And yet, every time he tried, there was still a high chance of failure.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes concocting thirty-colored flame all come down to luck\u2026?\u201d he murmured. He had already failed dozens of times, something that would drive most people to despair. After all, every failure involved a huge wastage of souls.</p><br/><p>Even with the massive stockpile he had built up, it was still a shocking loss. Based on his calculations, he only had enough for about twenty more tries, after which he would be out of souls.</p><br/><p>During his years traveling in the void, he hadn\u2019t collected all of the souls there were to be had, but had definitely acquired a good portion. Whatever scattered souls that still remained in random locations would be very troublesome to track down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to make this work!\u201d Sighing, he continued to work hard. A few days later, intense rumblings sounds erupted out, and an unsightly expression appeared on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face. After sitting there in a bit of a daze for a while, he started working again\u2026.</p><br/><p>Thus, the days marched by. A month later, he had eight more failures under his belt, each one seemingly due to a different reason. He still couldn\u2019t figure out exactly what the problem was. Another month passed, and he was starting to form the kernel of an idea about what was going on. His next session of conjuring went very smoothly\u2026.</p><br/><p>His heart pounded, and he stopped breathing as he focused completely on his task at hand. His mind emptied of everything, as he concentrated completely on\u2026 the sea of fire!</p><br/><p>An unknown amount of time passed. Eventually, he began to regain his faculties, whereupon he found himself looking at\u2026 a dazzling tongue of flame, floating right there in front of him!</p><br/><p>\u201cThirty colors\u2026.\u201d Shivering with excitement, he thought back to all of the hard work that had gone into this moment, and what it would be like to resurrect Bai Hao. And then, he started laughing at the top of his lungs!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

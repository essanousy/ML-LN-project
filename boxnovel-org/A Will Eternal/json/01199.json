Hah!</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>The old man slowly began to look up.</p><br/><p>He wore green garments, and didn\u2019t seem very impressive at all with his white hair and emaciated frame. He was even a bit hunched over. But after looking up at Bai Xiaochun, he straightened, and his eyes began to shine even more brightly. Suddenly, his facial features began to change, and an expression of anger filled his face.</p><br/><p>As his energy began to build, his hair changed, transforming from white to pitch black!</p><br/><p>By the time he finished looking up, he didn\u2019t look like an old man anymore, but rather, middle-aged!</p><br/><p>Even as his energy soared, the divine sense and cultivation base fluctuations of the Archaean Realm erupted out from him, as well as a unique, holy air!</p><br/><p>Although the man now seemed to be on the same level as the Vile-Emperor or the Saint-Emperor, he was a bit off in terms of his cognitive ability and overall strength. And yet\u2026 even a slightly weakened archaean\u2026 was still an archaean!!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t help but shiver in fear. All of a sudden, he felt like he was facing a chaotic, primeval beast, something whose mere gaze caused all of his hair to stand on end.</p><br/><p>However, it was actually an exciting sensation!</p><br/><p>He wanted to learn from this archaean\u2026 and to do so in a safe fashion!</p><br/><p>There could be no better and safer sparring partner than this old man!</p><br/><p>Shouting at the top of his lungs, he powered up as well, his energy rapidly reaching that of the late Celestial Realm. He also drew on his fleshly body power as he prepared to fight. As a result, although his aura couldn\u2019t quite match up to the archaean\u2019s, his overall energy was close!</p><br/><p>They looked at each other for moment, causing rumbling sounds to echo out between them. Then, in the blink of an eye, they both blurred into motion, slamming into each other and causing deafening booms to fill the air.</p><br/><p>Frightened, Bai Xiaochi quickly performed a double-handed incantation gesture, sealing the entire area off. Then, he backed up to watch, his expression that of concern, but his true feelings anything but that.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho gave you the right to bully me, Bai Xiaochun!? Hmmmphh! Did you really think the grand spirit automaton of this fan would be looking out for you? Yeah right! I just want to see you get beat up!\u201d Although he didn\u2019t dare to give voice to such thoughts, his eyes glittered as he observed the fighting from a distance.</p><br/><p>Booms rang out for about seven or eight breaths of time. At that point, blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mouth as he staggered backward several hundred meters before finally forcing himself to a stop. As for the archaean, he simply hovered in place, clasping hands and bowing in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cArchaeans really are pretty incredible\u2026.\u201d Bai Xiaochun murmured, his eyes glittering thoughtfully. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even use any big divine abilities, only ordinary magical techniques and fleshly body power. But even that was enough to force me back\u2026. I can only stay in the fight for a few breaths of time.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy biggest advantage isn\u2019t being in the late Celestial Realm, it\u2019s\u2026 having the powers of regeneration from the Undying Live Forever Technique!\u201d As his injuries healed, he charged into battle once again, using all of his fleshly body power and divine abilities to see what he could do against this archaean.</p><br/><p>Living Mountain Incantation! Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformation!</p><br/><p>Mountain Shaking Bash! Undying Hex!</p><br/><p>Throat Crushing Grasp! Live Forever Lamp!</p><br/><p>Sutra of Past Reincarnation! Sutra of Present Life and Death!</p><br/><p>In one interchange after another, he used all of the magics he had learned through the years, with the exception of his Undying Sovereign\u2019s Fist and the Waterswamp Kingdom.</p><br/><p>Thanks to this constant fighting, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation base remained in the late Celestial Realm, but his battle prowess advanced by leaps and bounds. He constantly mixed up the way he used his divine abilities and magical techniques. And thanks to his powers of regeneration, he could fight over and over again, and find his own weaknesses and limitations.</p><br/><p>Days passed in which Bai Xiaochun was completely wrapped up in his training with the archaean slave. At one point, he asked Bai Xiaochi about the fan\u2019s overall trajectory, but unfortunately, didn\u2019t get much solid information. Bai Xiaochun also found time to work on the third level of his Time Immemorial Codex. Unfortunately, that required a lot of time, as well as a peaceful and calm heart. At the moment, he was too worried about Song Junwan, Zhou Zimo and Bruiser, as well as all of the people from the Heavenspan Realm. After some failures with the enlightenment, he focused completely on sparring with the archaean slave.</p><br/><p>As his battle prowess increased, the archaean slave slowly began to resort to more complex and powerful magical techniques, and also began to draw on more of his fleshly body power.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun lost every single time, but was making rapid, almost unbelievable progress. In the beginning, he could only last against the archaean slave\u2019s simplest magical techniques for seven or eight breaths of time. But now, even after the archaean had begun using powerful divine abilities, he could last for longer and longer.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiaochi, despite the fact that he already knew a lot about Bai Xiaochun, he was completely stunned by what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis guy\u2026 is pretty awesome!!\u201d Another few months went by, and it reached the point where Bai Xiaochun could fight the archaean slave for the time it takes half an incense stick to burn.</p><br/><p>He was now fully comfortable in the late Celestial Realm, and had reached new understandings of his own magical techniques. Finally, he demanded that the archaean slave fight even harder!</p><br/><p>A boom could be heard as Bai Xiaochun was sent tumbling backward a hundred paces. He was gasping for breath as his wounds began to recover, and yet, the battle spirit in his eyes shone brightly.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cUse your highest level of battle prowess!\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>The archaean\u2019s eyes glittered as he blurred into motion, becoming a wild tempest that caused the entire damaged fan to shudder.</p><br/><p>Startled, Bai Xiaochi strengthened the sealing marks he had put in place. As for Bai Xiaochun, his eyes shone with madness in the face of the destructive tempest of power that was the archaean slave.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe time has finally come to see if my Undying Sovereign\u2019s Fist\u2026 can shake a trump card ability from an archaean!\u201d Shouting at the top of his lungs, he clenched his hand into a fist, causing cracking sounds to ring out in all directions. A huge wind sprang up, and within his celestial aura\u2026 a scrap of sovereign aura appeared!</p><br/><p>The archaean slave shivered and braced himself. At the same time, an enormous figure appeared in the air behind Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>The shadowy emperor looked like he always had, except\u2026 for his right arm!</p><br/><p>\u201cUndying Sovereign\u2019s Fist!\u201d Bai Xiaochun shouted, lunging forward, his fist seemingly wreathed in flames as it struck toward the archaean slave!</p><br/><p>As the fist shot forward, the shadowy emperor\u2019s sovereign arm seemed to fuse with Bai Xiaochun, making it seem like he was a sovereign unleashing a fist strike!</p><br/><p>For the first time, the archaean slave let out a shout of fear. Not daring to hold anything back, he unleashed all of the energy he could muster, throwing out his hands to cause countless streams of golden light to shoot out from him. The light instantly transformed into a golden face, which howled as it lunged toward Bai Xiaochun\u2019s incoming fist.</p><br/><p>In what was only the shortest of moments, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Undying Sovereign\u2019s Fist slammed into the archaean slave\u2019s deadliest move.</p><br/><p>A huge shockwave spread out through the world of the fan face, accompanied by intense rumbling sounds. The entire fan actually trembled. Bai Xiaochi let out a shriek of terror, and did everything he could to force the magical seals he had put in place to hold tight!</p><br/><p>At the same time, blood oozed out of the corners of the archaean slave\u2019s mouth, and he staggered backward several steps!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun also staggered backward, coughing up blood. A few hundred meters away, he lurched to a halt, his eyes shining with excitement and delight!</p><br/><p>\u201cI can hurt an archaean!!\u201d At this point, he threw his head back and laughed uproariously. His fist strike truly could hurt an archaean. Although he had ended up hurt in the process as well, with the powers of regeneration of his Undying Live Forever Technique, that was something he could deal with.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, in this case, if I use my Archaean Luminescence\u2026 then what reason do I have to worry about the Vile-Emperor!?!?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

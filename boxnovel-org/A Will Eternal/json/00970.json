The cultivators from the Cloud Order and the Lightning Order were all watching with rapt attention. Based on what everyone could tell, it didn\u2019t matter if Bai Xiaochun were even stronger than he had already proven to be, he would still die for his brazenness!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Bai Xiaochun is strong, but he's forgotten that he isn't in the east anymore. This is the north!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! How dare he throw his weight around here in the north. We\u2019re definitely going to show him a thing or two!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI refuse to believe that Master Cloud Lightning and the other devas all working together can\u2019t kill that one measly Bai Xiaochun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone was now starting to calm down, and were showing nothing but open disdain toward Bai Xiaochun. Meanwhile, Master Cloud Lightning and the other devas were closing in rapidly.</p><br/><p>Cold light flickered in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes. He had been restraining himself ever since he arrived in the north, but now that he had four devas all showing open killing intent, his anger erupted in full.</p><br/><p>Instead of backing up, he advanced, waving his hand to summon the Waterswamp Kingdom. Water vapor roiled in all directions as a huge clawed hand shot out.</p><br/><p>Everything shook violently, catching all of the devas completely by surprise. Master Cloud Lightning wasn't affected very deeply, but the three other devas gasped, and one of them even coughed up blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun!\u201d Master Cloud Lightning, the top deva in the north, roared in rage at this. Transforming into a beam of bright light, he shot directly toward Bai Xiaochun, simultaneously shouting, \u201cCloud Lightning Forefather: Seventh Transformation!!\u201d</p><br/><p>An ear-splitting rumbling sound spread out as Master Cloud Lightning rapidly grew to a height of 210 meters. He truly looked like the forefather of all humanity, with a cultivation base and battle prowess that skyrocketed seemingly without limit. In an instant, he was past the late Deva Realm, and was like a tempest bearing down on Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>However, that was when Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flashed, and he shouted, \u201cSuper Suppression Forefather, Fifth Transformation!\u201d</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOOOOOM!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun also grew rapidly in size, until he was 150 meters tall, with a wild and barbaric aura, and a burly, savage appearance. Within his left eye was a moon sigil that shone with dazzling light, which made his fifth transformation\u2026 as powerful as the eighth!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is impossible!!\u201d Master Cloud Lightning\u2019s eyes bulged on the verge of popping out of his skull. The reason he hadn\u2019t resorted to his eighth transformation was that it was too draining. Furthermore, how could he possibly have ever guessed that Bai Xiaochun would actually use the exact same divine ability as him!?</p><br/><p>They slammed into each other, and a massive boom echoed out in all directions. The air vibrated as Master Cloud Lightning tumbled backward, blood spraying out of his mouth.</p><br/><p>Although he was shaken physically, he was even more shaken mentally, and was panting in disbelief. The Cloud Lightning Forefather technique was a secret magic that belonged to the north. And yet, in completely unexpected fashion, Bai Xiaochun had used it right in front of him, a fact that instantly shoved him further toward madness.</p><br/><p>Even worse was the fact that he had only used the fifth transformation, and yet had completely overpowered his own seventh transformation. It was utterly maddening.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun,\u201d he roared, \u201chow dare you steal a secret legacy technique of the north!!\u201d Without any hesitation, he utilized his eighth transformation, reaching a height of 240 meters, whereupon he charged back into the fray.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s bullshit and you know it!\u201d Bai Xiaochun shot back. \u201cYou\u2019re using the <em>Cloud Lightning</em> Forefather technique, and I'm using the <em>Super Suppression</em> Forefather technique! The names are totally different! What are you, blind? Or deaf? Or both?!\u201d Snorting coldly, he launched forward, slamming into Master Cloud Lightning.</p><br/><p>As they separated from the exchange, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s qi and blood was boiling. Eyes shining with the desire to do battle, he lurched backward, performed a double-handed incantation gesture, and then shouted out at the top of his lungs</p><br/><p>\u201cLiving Mountain Incantation!\u201d</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUMBLE!</p><br/><p>Countless rocks and boulders began to fly through the air, covering Bai Xiaochun\u2019s 150-meter frame and causing him to grow larger and taller. Within moments, he was a 300-meter-tall stone golem.</p><br/><p>The combination of the Forefather Transformation with the Living Mountain Incantation produced shocking results, and shook everything in the area due to the sheer stunning levels of energy involved. All of the northern cultivators gasped, and began to cry out in alarm.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the energy of the Living Mountain Incantation caused a massive wind to spring up, a wind so powerful it stung the faces of all cultivators it touched. Master Cloud Lightning couldn\u2019t help but gasp in shock.</p><br/><p>He suddenly had the intense premonition that Bai Xiaochun\u2026 was too much for him to handle!</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit. Dammit! How could he have become so strong?!?!?! Only someone in the great circle of the Deva Realm could possibly be a match for him. And he hasn\u2019t even used that trump card fist strike yet\u2026.\u201d At that point, Master Cloud Lightning\u2019s pupils constricted, and he began to back up as quickly as possible. However, even as he did, Bai Xiaochun began to stride forward!</p><br/><p>As he went after Master Cloud Lightning, Bai Xiaochun let out a low-pitched growl that contained heavenly might, forcing the other devas to brace themselves and fight back against it.</p><br/><p>One of them transformed into a black lightning bolt, another split up into nine cloud projections, and the third summoned an enormous furnace. Then all three of them shot forward to block Bai Xiaochun\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t even look at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet the hell out of my way!\u201d Roaring, he waved his hand, sending a blast of wind out to meet them.</p><br/><p>The black lightning bolt shattered, the nine cloud projections were ripped to pieces, and the enormous furnace broke into countless fragments. The three devas all coughed up blood, expressions of disbelief overtaking their faces as Bai Xiaochun flew right past them.</p><br/><p>\u201cToo\u2026 too strong!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun hadn\u2019t slowed down at all. As he closed in on Master Cloud Lightning, he clenched his hand into a fist, causing a black vortex to spring up around it.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou ambushed me in the trial by fire, Master Cloud Lightning. And afterwards, you were completely unreasonable! And now you want to rely on your late Deva Realm cultivation base to kill me?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou've been pestering me constantly since I got to the north. Well now, on this day, we\u2019re going to settle all our debts and grudges!\u201d</p><br/><p>Master Cloud Lightning\u2019s mind was reeling, especially considering that he could plainly see Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fist, and the black vortex spinning around it. Face flickering wildly, he flew backward and screamed, \u201cWhat are you people standing around for!? Activate the sect\u2019s grand defensive spell formation!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other three devas all began to shout orders.</p><br/><p>\u201cActivate formation!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPower up the grand spell formation!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As for the surrounding northern cultivators who had been standing around in stunned shock, they finally recovered from their reveries. Faces pale, they immediately began to go about activating their sect\u2019s grand spell formation!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a process that took a lot of time. Even as Bai Xiaochun closed in on Master Cloud Lightning, a massive force sprang out from the Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect, creating a misty shield that emanated a formidable force of expulsion. Not only was Bai Xiaochun stopped in his tracks, but he was even pushed backward out of the sect.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun frowned as he was shoved in the opposite direction, completely beyond his control.</p><br/><p>When Master Cloud Lightning and the other devas saw that, they finally breathed sighs of relief. The fight had spun out of control too quickly, leaving them more shaken with every second that passed.</p><br/><p>However, even as they breathed sighs of relief, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes glittered.</p><br/><p>\u201cSpell formations don't work against me!\u201d Drawing upon the Undying Hex, he bypassed the force of expulsion and pierced back through the spell formation shield. Shockingly, there was nothing that could stand in his way!</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as he appeared in front of Master Cloud Lightning, the black vortex around his fist rapidly devouring the spiritual energy in the area. An enormous, shadowy emperor appeared behind him, which then merged into his fist. The Undying Emperor\u2019s Fist!</p><br/><p>When that fist struck, anything in creation could be destroyed!</p><br/><p>Master Cloud Lightning\u2019s pupils constricted, and his mind spun crazily. There was no time to ponder what to do, and no way he could dodge out of the way. He could only howl at the top of his lungs and draw dangerously upon his energy to unleash his ninth transformation!</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, he was 270 meters tall and bracing himself for Bai Xiaochun\u2019s blow!</p><br/><p>A boom rang out that surpassed anything from before. All sound in the area was crushed, to the point where it almost seemed silent.</p><br/><p>Then the shockwave erupted, shaking the entire Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect to its foundations. At the same time, Master Cloud Lightning\u2019s eyes went wide, and he screamed uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoooo!!\u201d Blood erupted from his mouth like a waterfall as he was flung backward head over heels. He could no longer maintain his transformed form, and he shrank back down and then split apart into two people, both of whom continued to tumble backward, blood spraying out of their mouths\u2026.</p><br/><p>The older brother among the two had it better off than the younger one. The younger brother simply couldn\u2019t withstand the force, and was ripped to shreds\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Even he wasn\u2019t sure exactly where he was.</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for his powerful fleshly body and the regenerative capabilities of his Undying Blood, he most likely would be dead. In fact, he was so dizzy it took him several breaths of time to recover.</p><br/><p>However, despite the fact that he was still a bit angry, some hope had finally appeared.</p><br/><p>Worried that the Frigid Matriarch might have heard his dialogue with the ghost face, he decided that it would be best to try to smooth things out. \u201cI thought you had just used me and dumped me, Frigid Crone\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, the Frigid Matriarch\u2019s voice echoed out into his mind yet again. \u201cThat old ghost caused some problems with the fusion process\u2026. I'm afraid it's going to take quite a bit of time. I need four or five years at least\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFour or five years?\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied, stunned. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, he got a very bad feeling about where things were going.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is no joke,\u201d the Frigid Matriarch continued. \u201cI can\u2019t reopen the entrance before I finish the process. Therefore, you need to live here for the next few years!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun heard her explanation, he nearly exploded.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you did screw me over after all!!\u201d he shouted, forgetting about trying to be safe. \u201cThere\u2019s no spiritual energy at all in this damn place! How am I supposed to practice cultivation? And what about that ghost? How am I supposed to survive for five years with him around? I want out of here. Now!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cTechnically speaking, there is no spiritual energy,\u201d the Frigid Matriarch said coolly. \u201cBut in the east, there is a sea of rain. In the west is the flaming sky. In the south are the thunderclouds. And in the north are the wind valleys. Those areas formed through convergences of spiritual energy. Just go there, and you shouldn\u2019t have any problem absorbing the energy!</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t do anything about that old ghost right now, and I can\u2019t expel him. However, as I gain further control of the magical item, I\u2019ll be able to slowly suppress him and lower his cultivation base!</p><br/><p>\u201cTake advantage of the good fortune here, and your cultivation base should progress by leaps and bounds. Just hang in there for a few years, and before long, you\u2019ll be strong enough to deal with him yourself!</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter I completely fuse with the magical item and become its spirit automaton, I\u2019ll need to sleep for a bit of time before fully activating it. Don\u2019t worry, before I sleep, I\u2019ll make sure you can leave. After fully activating the treasure, the north will rise to prominence, and our agreement will be fulfilled!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, this explanation only made Bai Xiaochun more frantic and nervous. Waving his hand urgently, he said, \u201cHold on, let me get this straight\u2026. You mean I need to wait four or five years until you become the spirit automaton. Then, you\u2019ll open the entrance and let me out. But afterward, you need to sleep for a bit more time to be able to fully activate the magical item?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Bai Xiaochun felt even more than ever like he was about to go crazy. \u201cWell how come you didn\u2019t explain that beforehand? Why\u2019d you wait until we were inside before telling me?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow was I supposed to know that some old ghost would follow you and sneak inside?! Look, it is what it is. I need a few years to become the spirit automaton, and before then, nobody can leave. You\u2019re on your own now, alright?\u201d With a cold snort, the Frigid Matriarch retracted her consciousness, leaving Bai Xiaochun completely alone.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, hold on a second!!\u201d he shouted. However, no amount of shouting and yelling got any response. In the end, he tugged at his hair in frustration and bitterness and said, \u201cLiars! Everyone\u2019s a liar! I guess I'm just too pure and simple.\u201d</p><br/><p>The idea of being stuck in this place for four or five years filled him with despair. Maybe if the old ghost wasn\u2019t stuck inside along with him, it might have been endurable.</p><br/><p>Forget four or five years! Keeping his poor little life safe for four or five months seemed difficult to do, let alone years.</p><br/><p>After stewing in frustration for a bit, he realized that he really had no options at hand, and that he would have to just deal with the situation. Finally, he crept out of the ice cave to try to figure out exactly where he was.</p><br/><p>Almost as soon as he was out in the open, he heard the crackle of thunder, and could see that, not too far off, endless thunderclouds filled the sky, along with\u2026 never-ending lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cLightning\u2026.\u201d he murmured, his eyes flickering with hesitation. He suddenly thought back to the Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect, and how the lightning bolts there had increased his cultivation base. However, he had also reached a point where the lightning bolts didn\u2019t aid him, and he had been unable to consume them. At that point, he had nearly been fried to death.</p><br/><p>He was torn over what to do, and was trying to decide what decision to make when, all of a sudden, he saw a strand of black smoke a few dozen meters behind him on the ice.</p><br/><p>The instant that smoke appeared, it converged into a fist-sized ghost face, which looked over at him.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes went wide, and he lurched into motion with a shriek of anguish.</p><br/><p>\u201cFound you at last!\u201d the ghost face said, smiling cruelly. At the moment, more than 10,000 similar wisps of black smoke in other locations on the ice plain all formed into ghost faces that spoke the exact same words.</p><br/><p>The more than 10,000 ghost faces rose up into the air and began to speed in the direction of the one that was closest to Bai Xiaochun. It took only a short moment for them to converge and transform into a towering ghost face.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re always messing things up for me, you little punk!\u201d the ghost face roared. \u201cI'm not going to give up until I skin you alive!!\u201d With that, it began to pursue Bai Xiaochun. Earlier, after abandoning the chase, he had made an attempt to wrest control of the magical item. Unfortunately, he found that the other divine soul which he had been competing against had been a bit faster, making his own efforts completely useless.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, his cultivation base level didn\u2019t qualify him to interrupt the process. The only option he could think of was to destroy the entire magical item, but that was something he could only have succeeded at when at his peak level of power.</p><br/><p>In his frustration and anger, he decided that he would first kill Bai Xiaochun, and then come up with a way to solve the problem later. After using a secret magic to split into 10,000 parts, he had spread out in all directions\u2026 and finally found Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first time, the Celestial showed up!\u201d he said angrily. \u201cThe second time, I didn\u2019t have the attention to spare to kill you! The third time, that damned spirit automaton teleported you away\u2026. You\u2019re pretty lucky, punk. But I refuse to believe that on this fourth time, you\u2019ll escape into a bunch of lightning that even I'm fearful of!\u201d Although the ghost face was coming to find that this Bai Xiaochun was relatively hard to kill, he still snorted coldly and shot after him as quickly as possible in the direction of the thunderclouds.</p><br/><p>As he closed in, he spit out a burst of black smoke that transformed into a clawed hand that attempted to grab Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun's heart was filled with a sensation of deadly crisis. Without any hesitation, he spit a beam of black light out of his mouth, which was the turtle wok. Pushing it out almost like a shield, he used it to defend against the clawed ghost hand.</p><br/><p>A boom rang out, and Bai Xiaochun coughed up a mouthful of blood. The force of the blow sent him flying backward, flesh torn and bleeding, cultivation base unstable. However, the fearsome regenerative power of the Undying Blood immediately began to heal him.</p><br/><p>In fact, he even borrowed the momentum to shoot forward, simultaneously using his Undying Hex.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother treasure?\u201d the ghost face said, shocked by the sudden appearance of the turtle-wok. Then his face lit up with delight.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiaochun, his eyes were now completely bloodshot. Even defending himself with the turtle-wok had resulted in significant injuries, which made sense considering the vast difference in battle prowess between himself and his opponent.</p><br/><p>Given how closely he was being pursued, he realized that he only had one chance\u2026 the thundercloud region!</p><br/><p>Although the lightning constantly smashed the ground to bits in terrifying fashion, and the horrors of Lightning Penitentiary were still fresh in mind, he had no other options.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to go for broke!!\u201d he roared. Even as the ghost face closed in, Bai Xiaochun\u2026 blurred into motion toward the thunderclouds!</p><br/><p>The instant he entered the region, a lightning bolt locked onto him and shot down.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

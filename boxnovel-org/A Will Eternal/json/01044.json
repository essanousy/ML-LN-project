He could sense that the vortex he had created was gone, which meant that the battleship was likely closing in at top speed.</p><br/><p>\u201cComplete and utter bullying!!\u201d the Giant Ghost King grumbled. His face was pale, and he looked quite bedraggled. Without the help of the moonflower just now, he would have suffered a bitter defeat at the hands of the other demigods. \u201cIf I had the Grand Heavenmaster and the other heavenly kings to back me up, we five could definitely have stood up to them!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghost King was actually feeling quite embarrassed by how the fight had played out.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing we hatched our plan and left that town,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said. \u201cIf we had been caught by Ghostmother there, we would have been like fish in a barrel.\u201d At the moment, he was feeling very irritated. Considering the look of wild ambition he had seen in Ghostmother\u2019s eyes, he was sure that she would chase him down to the bitter end.</p><br/><p>If he were in the Heavenspan Realm, things would have been a bit easier, with plenty of options and places to go to remain safe. But in the Eternal Lands, and on the border of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, it was too dangerous to allow any delays to occur.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf only I could get Ghostmother off of that battleship,\u201d he thought with a sigh. Unfortunately, Ghostmother was being very careful, and hadn\u2019t made any slipups. Right now, he had no options. Sending his divine sense out, he scanned the Eternal Sea, and yet saw nothing but endless water, with no places to hole up.</p><br/><p>As Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King anxiously tried to come up with a plan, massive rumbling sounds could be heard coming from the bone lizard behind them.</p><br/><p>When the howls of the evil ghosts that made up the black cloud reached Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King, their pupils constricted.</p><br/><p>A moment ago, the bone lizard had used the blood mist to gain an additional burst of speed that sent it rocketing forward even faster than before.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun only had the time to flick his sleeve to separate himself and the Giant Ghost King, then turn to face the bone lizard.</p><br/><p>Cracking sounds could be heard as rifts opened up everywhere. However, these were the Eternal Lands, and therefore, the rifts healed almost immediately.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, a sea of flames had erupted out of the mouth of the bone lizard, sending intense heat out in all directions.</p><br/><p>Yet again, the black beam of light shot out, filled with deadly power.</p><br/><p>The two ghost faces were also present, and were fanning out as if to block Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>It was a moment of deadly crisis, and there was no time to contemplate the situation. Bai Xiaochun immediately threw his hands out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaterswamp!\u201d</p><br/><p>Water vapor roiled out, turning the world hazy. Even as Ghostmother\u2019s eyes narrowed up on the battleship, Bai Xiaochun threw his arms down.</p><br/><p>\u201cKingdom!!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Roar!</em></p><br/><p>Heaven and earth trembled as a beastly howl filled the air that seemed to come from countless years in the past. As it echoed out, a huge black landmass rose up from within the watery swamp!</p><br/><p>Blood scales and bloodshot eyes could be seen, along with a fishy odor as\u2026 a gigantic crocodilian head appeared!</p><br/><p>By the time the lower jaw was visible, the demigods present were so stunned that their jaws dropped.</p><br/><p>As for the bone lizard, it was huge, but compared to this crocodilian creature, it actually looked insignificant.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is that?!?!\u201d That was what all the demigods were thinking as they rushed backward in retreat. Meanwhile, the huge crocodilian mouth opened\u2026 and snapped toward the bone lizard.</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghost King knew Bai Xiaochun well, but when he saw this, he was so shaken his eyes nearly popped out of his skull.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that really a divine ability?\u201d he thought, his heart pounding with fear. He also backed up, doing everything in his power to get as far away as he could. Bai Xiaochun did the same thing, not even waiting to see what would happen behind him as he fled with the Giant Ghost King.</p><br/><p>The bone lizard wanted to give chase, but it was too late as the huge crocodilian mouth snapped down onto it. From a distance, it almost looked like the crocodilian creature had risen up out of the Eternal Sea and swallowed the lizard!</p><br/><p>The battleship seemed powerless to fight back. Not even the blood mist shield could help it to flee out of the closing crocodilian mouth.</p><br/><p>The enemy demigods were terrified to find that they couldn\u2019t get out of the affected area; the mouth slammed shut, causing intense rumbling sounds to fill the air. Then, the crocodilian creature sank back down, making it seem almost like it was going down into the waters of the Eternal Sea.</p><br/><p>When the crocodilian head disappeared, the watery swamp faded away. After about ten seconds passed, the rumbling sounds were gone.</p><br/><p>Then, a rift broke open, and the bone lizard shot out, howling the entire way.</p><br/><p>It was visibly damaged! Although the Waterswamp Kingdom hadn\u2019t destroyed it, it had inflicted serious injuries! Apparently, the Waterswamp Kingdom was even stronger when unleashed within the Eternal Lands!</p><br/><p>Although Ghostmother looked slightly anxious, her eyes glowed with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, I finally got you to pull out a true trump card! And don\u2019t you dare think that using it on me a second time will have the same results!\u201d She chuckled, a sound filled with both avarice and anticipation.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was even stronger than she had hoped, and now that he had revealed his true trump card, she felt confident enough to attack him directly!</p><br/><p>Smiling a radiant smile, she turned the battleship in his direction and began to chase him down!</p><br/><p>She only had three demigods left, but was confident that if she could get her hands on Bai Xiaochun, it would all be worth it!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re mine, Bai Xiaochun, all mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ghostmother licked her lips slowly, a sight that, if anyone could see it who didn't know the current circumstances, would have jumped to very different conclusions about what was going on\u2026.</p><br/><p>Several thousand kilometers away, Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King were fleeing across the Eternal Sea. Grim expressions covered their faces, and neither was saying much. As for the Giant Ghost King, bitterness and unease filled his heart. The terrifying strength of Ghostmother had already sapped his hope of reaching the Saint-Emperor Dynasty.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do we do?\u201d he murmured inwardly. \u201cWe have to think of something?!\u201d Of course, he hadn\u2019t noticed that a strange light that had begun to glitter in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun simply wasn\u2019t willing to give up. He was now confident that if it weren\u2019t for the bone galleon, even a celestial like Ghostmother wouldn\u2019t be able to kill him. Ghostmother\u2019s only strength lay in that battleship.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder how Hou Xiaomei is doing\u2026?\u201d he thought. After all, Ghostmother had brought Hou Xiaomei and Big Fatty Zhang with her to the Eternal Lands, and yet, he hadn\u2019t seen any hint that they were currently with her. Presumably, Ghostmother would remain tight-lipped if he tried to get any information about them from her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know\u2026 two measly demigods is not a very good blood tribute\u2026. We need to do something far more shocking!\u201d Expression flickering, and eyes turning more bloodshot, he began to build on an idea he had just come up with moments before.</p><br/><p>After some more thought, he turned and grabbed the Giant Ghost King\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, old pal. What do you think\u2026 about kidnapping Ghostmother?! What kind of reward do you think the Saint-Emperor would give us for her!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghost King had just been thinking about ways to escape the situation when Bai Xiaochun grabbed him. When he looked over and saw the wild look in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes, and heard his suggestion, he was completely taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cKidnap Ghostmother?\u201d Something about the whole situation seemed very familiar, but there was no time to think about that now. The mere idea left the Giant Ghost King feeling stunned. After all, there were a total of six celestials in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, all of whom were shocking figures. If one were to be kidnapped, it would send shockwaves through all of the Eternal Lands. That would be a blood tribute that defied the imaginations of everyone.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t do anything impulsive, Xiaochun\u2026.\u201d he began. After all, the two of them were currently fleeing from certain death. To the Giant Ghost King, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s suggestion seemed almost ludicrous.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome on! Yes? Or No?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, glaring. If the Giant Ghost King had immediately agreed, he might have hesitated. After all, the idea really was a bit crazy.</p><br/><p>But when he saw how nervous the Giant Ghost King was, he felt more than a little annoyed.</p><br/><p>Forehead veins bulging, he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cGiant Ghost, old pal, didn\u2019t you say you wanted to do something momentous? What could be better than kidnapping a celestial? You want big? If we do that, it\u2019ll shake all of the Eternal Lands!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghost King\u2019s heart began to pound as he thought, \u201cWhy not kidnap an archaean then\u2026?\u201d But then he suddenly realized why the look in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes seemed so familiar\u2026. \u201cFudge! That\u2019s what he looked like\u2026 when he kidnapped me! He\u2019s a kidnapping expert!\u201d</p><br/><p>A wry smile broke out on the Giant Ghost King face. Then he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cAlright, let\u2019s do it! How do we pull it off?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

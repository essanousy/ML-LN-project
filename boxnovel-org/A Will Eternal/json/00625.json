Don\u2019t be such a prude. Oh right. Don\u2019t forget to leave the prisoners in the cells alone. They\u2019re murderers and fiends, every last one of them. Accidents have happened in the past, you know. Their cultivation bases are sealed, but on one occasion, one of them bit off the ear of one of the guards.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>After giving a few more reminders and warnings, the captain left to enjoy himself.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun felt like a new world had been opened up to him. After looking around, he realized that quite a few of the gray-robed prisoners were looking over at him. They quickly identified him as a new guard, and hurried over to offer greetings.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, exalted one....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you need anything, exalted one, please just say the word....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re so young, exalted one. Now that you\u2019re a guard in Devil Penitentiary, you have boundless prospects for the future. You\u2019re like a dragon among men....\u201d</p><br/><p>As everyone began to fawn over him, Bai Xiaochun noticed several attractive female cultivators giving him the eye. Obviously, they were trying to seduce him!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart started to pound with the realization that all he needed to do was point his finger, and any of those female cultivators would cater to his every whim....</p><br/><p>\u201cFudge, this place is evil!!\u201d Panting, Bai Xiaochun realized that this really wasn\u2019t the type of place for him. As he continued to revel in the praise of the prisoners, and the gentle voices of the female cultivators, he continued to stew in anxiety....</p><br/><p>\u201cWho would ever have thought that Devil Penitentiary would be like this?\u201d he thought. \u201cBai Xiaochun is a pure person! How could he deign to wallow in a place like this...?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he anxiously allowed the prisoners to lead him off into the distance... he came to understand what Devil Penitentiary was really like, that it was the type of place where you could truly say... <em>anything goes</em>.</p><br/><p>Eventually, Bai Xiaochun realized that he really liked Devil Penitentiary, and that the world really was a wonderful place.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut Bai Xiaochun is a clean-living and honest person. I definitely won't do anything to violate my conscience!\u201d Six hours later, Bai Xiaochun felt more wonderful than ever about being in Devil Penitentiary. At that point, he followed the directions given him by the helpful prisoners to meet back up with the rest of the squad.</p><br/><p>The captain was already present, as were seven or eight of the other guards. Everyone seemed to be in wonderful moods, and were chatting happily. However, the long-faced young man was also there, and as soon as he saw Bai Xiaochun, his expression turned grim.</p><br/><p>He held this traitor from the Bai Clan in complete contempt. As far as he was concerned, anyone who would kidnap his own father and kill his own fellow clan members was completely perverse, and the type of person who actually deserved to be locked up in Devil Penitentiary.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he had been friends with Bai Qi, which deepened his hatred.</p><br/><p>As for the other guards, they simply pretended not to see Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun stood there feeling a bit awkward, and starting to get angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with this guy?\u201d he thought. \u201cWhat\u2019s he picking on me for?\u201d With that, he began to assess the young man\u2019s cultivation base, which caused the young man to look over at him with icy eyes.</p><br/><p>The captain could see that tension was building up between the two of them, so he quickly planted himself in the middle and then pointed at a nearby skull.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s get to business. See that guy, Bai Hao? That\u2019s Old Devil Zhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>The long-faced young man snorted coldly, and Bai Xiaochun suppressed his anger to look in the direction the captain was pointing.</p><br/><p>Within the huge skull sat a burly man who, despite being seated cross-legged, was still nearly two meters tall. From the look of it, if he stood up, he would almost be as tall as one of the savage giants. He was a real brute.</p><br/><p>His eyes glowed red, and a ferocious-looking smile twisted his lips. Furthermore, he looked at the guards with a greedy expression that almost made it seem like he wanted to eat them.... As soon as Bai Xiaochun laid eyes on him, he got the sense that the man was a cannibal of some sort.</p><br/><p>He had a murderous aura that made him seem completely impervious to reason, the type who would murder people left and right without the slightest compunction.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is Old Devil Zhou,\u201d the captain continued. \u201cNot only is he a cold-blooded murderer, but he\u2019s addicted to eating children. A hundred years ago, he ate so many children it was impossible to count. However, because of his connections to the Cai Clan, one of the three great clans, he managed to get spared from the death penalty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun frowned. He wasn't the type of person who instantly believed everything he heard. However, although the captains story seemed a bit unbelievable, based on what this Old Devil Zhou looked like, it seemed possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cBut now that he's here,\u201d the captain continued icily, \u201che has to live a life of suffering.\u201d By this point, all of the rest of the guards had gathered.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, let\u2019s begin. This is our last chance to get him to talk!\u201d The captain waved his sleeve, and Squad 9 headed, grim-faced, toward Old Devil Zhou\u2019s cell.</p><br/><p>When Old Devil Zhou saw them coming over, his vicious grin widened, and his eyes glittered. Suddenly, he jumped to his feet, grabbed the eyeholes of the skull, and let out a furious roar.</p><br/><p>That roar caused everyone to stop in place for a moment.</p><br/><p>\u201cUseless fools! I, Zhou Yunlong, have eaten so many people like you I\u2019ve lost count!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d barked one of the guards, jumping forward and performing an incantation gesture. Then he waved his finger at the skull, which changed colors. At the same time, the flicker of lightning could be seen inside, causing Old Devil Zhou to tremble, and then let out an agonized shriek.</p><br/><p>The guards of Squad 9, looking very fierce and dangerous, went about using all the tricks they could think of.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell us where the treasure is!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpit it out and we won\u2019t torment you! But if you don't talk, then don\u2019t blame us for what happens!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior Zhou, there\u2019s no need to be like this. Now that you\u2019re in here, you won\u2019t be getting out. None of your assets on the outside will do you any good. Why not just reveal the truth? Then things will go easy for you! In fact, life inside could actually be pretty nice for you.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Some of them threatened, some of them cajoled. Every method possible was pulled out to try to get him to reveal the location of whatever treasure it was they were talking about. However, no matter what they did, and no matter how Old Devil Zhou screamed, the vicious smile never left his face. And in fact, it only grew more vicious.</p><br/><p>Finally, the long-faced young man strode forward. Laughing coldly, he said, \u201cNot gonna talk, huh? Fine, I\u2019ll <em>force</em> it out of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the young man walked forward, the other guards started to get excited.</p><br/><p>\u201cZhao Feng is Squad 9\u2019s inquisitor! If you don't talk, then he\u2019ll pry your mouth open!\u2019</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right! The other eight squads might not have succeeded, but Zhao Feng can!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even the captain\u2019s eyes were glowing with anticipation. As for Bai Xiaochun, he simply watched what was happening. Although he wasn\u2019t sure what an <em>inquisitor</em> was, he had the feeling that the long-faced young man must have some higher standing than everyone else. It sounded like <em>inquisitor</em> was a title or rank of some sort.</p><br/><p>The long-faced young man walked up to the cell and performed a double-handed incantation gesture, summoning a long black needle. Instantly, the needle shot forward and stabbed into Old Devil Zhou, provoking an unprecedentedly ragged scream.</p><br/><p>A moment later, Old Devil Zhou\u2019s eyes turned bright red, and yet the arrogance within them didn\u2019t fade in the least. Eventually, he stopped screaming, and then started laughing.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat's all you\u2019ve got? I've eaten tons of inquisitors like you in the past. Delicious, every last one of them! I wonder what you taste like though?\u201d</p><br/><p>The long-faced young man looked angrily at Old Devil Zhou, then went to work on another incantation gesture. However, no matter what he did, Old Devil Zhou just kept laughing and laughing. Furious, the other guards did everything they could to help out.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun stood off to the side, looking on in shock as the guards of Squad 9 interrogated and tormented Old Devil Zhou. Nearly a day passed, and although Old Devil Zhou was left gasping for breath, he still didn\u2019t say a word about his treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit this guy is tight-lipped!\u201d Eventually, the guards began to back down, glaring at Old Devil Zhou as if they wished they could break into his brain to get the information they wanted. That was especially true of the long-faced young man.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen Old Devil Zhou was incarcerated recently,\u201d the captain explained, \u201che didn\u2019t have a thing on him. But he built up quite the treasure trove in his life. He obviously hid it away somewhere!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was in the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage, half a step into the Deva Realm. He dominated the world for an entire sixty-year-cycle, and massacred more than thirty entire clans! He definitely has a lot of treasures!\u201d</p><br/><p>After seeing how angry his fellow guards were, Bai Xiaochun hesitated for a moment, and then finally asked, \u201cUm... why don\u2019t you soulsearch him?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

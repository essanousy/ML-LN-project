Partially due to monsoon winds, only some of the black smoke had made it into the clouds above Violet Cauldron Peak. The rest had been carried by the wind to Green Crest Peak.</p><br/><p>If it had only been a tiny bit, it would eventually have just faded away without doing anything. But considering the daily buildup, it was no surprise that when rain began to fall on Violet Cauldron Peak, the effects eventually spread to Green Crest Peak....</p><br/><p>Originally, the disciples from Green Crest Peak had simply watched the events playing out on Fragrant Cloud Peak and Violet Cauldron Peak, shocked, but at the same time, gloating in the misfortune of the other disciples. Furthermore, they had all taken steps to prevent Bai Xiaochun from ever coming to Green Crest Peak.</p><br/><p>Third Fatty Hei\u2019s friends had even warned her against taking him in.</p><br/><p>But then, the raindrops began to fall. Shocked expressions appeared as people looked up to find that the sky above Green Crest Peak was filled with black clouds.</p><br/><p>Although they weren\u2019t as dense as those above Violet Cauldron Peak, once the acid rain began to fall, and the disciples\u2019 clothes began to melt, cries of alarm rose up.</p><br/><p>As the screams intensified, numerous beams of sword light shot out from Green Crest Peak toward Violet Cauldron Peak, joining the group of disciples from there who were chasing down Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Don\u2019t tell me that Bai Xiaochun secretly came to Green Crest Peak too!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe must have! That vile fiend! He definitely snuck over here to concoct medicine!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Green Crest Peak disciples were going mad. Quite a few were already on the verge of losing all of their clothing. Putting on new clothing didn\u2019t do any good. Green Crest Peak devolved into enraged chaos, and the disciples quickly became allies with the Violet Cauldron Peak disciples in their desire to catch Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyou was among them. Although his robes were still in one piece, his murderous rage burned hot. At long last, he had found an opportunity to pay Bai Xiaochun back for the events in the Wildweed Mountains.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds filled the air, along with Bai Xiaochun\u2019s screams. It was bad enough that the disciples of Violet Cauldron Peak were chasing him down, but then Green Crest Peak joined in.</p><br/><p>Then he heard what the Green Crest Peak disciples were saying, and he felt more deeply maligned than ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cI never went to Green Crest Peak. Really!!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of the more than 10,000 disciples from Green Crest Peak were in motion now, speeding along on their flying swords. When they heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s explanation, though, they only became angrier. \u201cLiar!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the sword light bore down on Bai Xiaochun, the Violet Cauldron Peak disciples unleashed countless magical techniques. Bai Xiaochun was so scared he was screaming at the top of his lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cI've shed my own blood for the sect--\u201d</p><br/><p>BOOM! The attacks of the Violet Cauldron Peak disciples were driving Bai Xiaochun to near madness.</p><br/><p>\u201cAIIIIEEEE! I\u2019m a Prestige disciple!!\u201d</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOM! As the countless beams of sword light closed in, Bai Xiaochun fluttered the wings on his back, and sweat poured down his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m the Junior Brother of the sect leader!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if you were the son of the sect leader, we\u2019d still beat the daylights out of you!!\u201d The disciples of two mountain peaks joined together in their anger as they chased after Bai Xiaochun with deadly intent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou people... you people are so unreasonable! They\u2019re trying to kill me! They\u2019re gonna kill me!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s scalp was entirely numb. He had done nothing more than concoct some pills, and these people had gone completely mad.</p><br/><p>Looking like he was about to cry, he pushed forward with as much speed as possible as he shot toward Fragrant Cloud Peak. Now, he suddenly felt as if the disciples from there were a lot more easy-going. After all, Fragrant Cloud Peak was his home.</p><br/><p>A huge mob was chasing him back toward Fragrant Cloud Peak. He looked like a mouse whose tail had been stepped on as he shot up the mountain, the other disciples in hot pursuit.</p><br/><p>Just as the disciples from the other mountains were about to step foot on Fragrant Cloud Peak, an enraged, thunderous snort echoed out from the summit of the mountain.</p><br/><p>\u201cTurn your asses around this instant!\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice sounded like the boom of thunder. All of the disciples preparing to charge up Fragrant Cloud Peak coughed up mouthfuls of blood and tumbled backward. A massive power roiled out, pushing all of them away. When the shock left their faces, they exchanged glances and quickly realized how impulsive they had been. Bowing their heads, they clasped hands in apology and retreated.</p><br/><p>The commotion quickly died down.</p><br/><p>As soon as Bai Xiaochun saw what had just happened, he was deeply moved. He almost felt like a young child who had been fighting, and losing, only to have a parent step in to the rescue and wallop the opponent.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right!\u201d he shouted, gesticulating wildly. \u201cTurn your asses around! Especially you people from Green Crest Peak, you--\u201d He was just about to explain how he really hadn\u2019t concocted any medicine on Green Crest Peak when all of a sudden, pressure weighed down on him as Li Qinghou materialized up ahead. Face grim, he waved his sleeve, causing Bai Xiaochun to fly through the air toward him. A moment later, he had Bai Xiaochun by the neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle Li, I-I-I really didn't go to Green Crest-- AIIIIIEEEE!!\u201d It didn\u2019t matter how fast he blurted the words, he couldn\u2019t finish speaking before Li Qinghou flew up into the air.</p><br/><p>The countless disciples from the other two mountain peaks watched in utter joy as the scene played out. As for the Fragrant Cloud Peak disciples, they looked on with odd expressions before letting out long sighs.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun really got unlucky this time!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe pissed off the peak lord. He\u2019s really in for it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe didn\u2019t just piss off the peak Lord, he drove the entire south bank crazy.\u201d As countless disciples looked on in delight, the blood drained from Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face. He had just noticed which direction Li Qinghou was heading. It was none other than....</p><br/><p>\u201c10,000.... 10,000 Snakes Valley!!\u201d Shrieking, he said, \u201cI'm sorry, Uncle Li!\u201d</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for Li Qinghou to take the wailing Bai Xiaochun behind Fragrant Cloud Peak to 10,000 Snakes Valley. As soon as they set foot inside, countless vipers looked up and hissed loudly. It was even possible to see the venom dripping from their fangs.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was so scared he started shaking. Most terrifying of all was that Li Qinghou continued toward the cave in the middle of the valley.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just wanted to concoct medicine! I didn\u2019t do it on purpose.... Uncle Li, you have to listen to me! I was just doing what you told me. I didn\u2019t concoct medicine on Fragrant Cloud Peak! I---\u201d</p><br/><p>All his frantic explanation did, however, was cause Li Qinghou\u2019s expression to grow even darker. He even sped up as he headed deep into the cave.</p><br/><p>At first, everything was black, but soon, one pair of cold eyes after another snapped open to stare icily at Bai Xiaochun and Li Qinghou. Because Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation base had advanced so much, he was able to see their auras much more clearly now.</p><br/><p>He was petrified to find that this place was far, far more terrifying than he had previously imagined.</p><br/><p>That was even more the case now that he had mastered all five volumes of spirit creatures. Even though they were surrounded by darkness, when he circulated his spiritual power, he quickly identified many of the snakes, and recalled the information about them.</p><br/><p>\u201cA three steps viper!</p><br/><p>\u201cA morningeye anaconda!!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s... a goldsilver verminsnake!\u201d To his shock, Bai Xiaochun found that all of the snakes were venomous, and according to the five volumes of spirit creatures, they were incredibly powerful. In fact, even Foundation Establishment cultivators who didn't deal with them quickly enough would be killed.</p><br/><p>After enough time passed for half an incense stick to burn, Li Qinghou had dragged Bai Xiaochun to the depths of the cave, into a huge subterranean cavern filled with countless hissing snakes. There were even nine that exuded the power of a cultivation base equivalent to the eighth level of Qi Condensation. Their eyes were bright red, and their fangs constantly dripped with shocking venom.</p><br/><p>A certain distance into the cavern was a stone hut surrounded by a spell formation that kept everything within thirty meters clear of snakes. That was where the snakes piled up en masse. Despite their distance from the hut itself, Bai Xiaochun still felt an intense sensation of deadly crisis.</p><br/><p>A thump could be heard as Li Qinghou waved his sleeve, sending Bai Xiaochun tumbling down next to the stone hut.</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to concoct medicine? Do it here. There\u2019s earthflame and a pill furnace. And take this. At least here you won't disturb any of the other disciples!\u201d Snorting coldly, Li Qinghou tossed a bag of holding over to Bai Xiaochun. \u201cYou\u2019ll find plenty of medicinal plants and food in there. Stay here and stay out of trouble. After you\u2019ve had some time to think, I\u2019ll come take you out.\u201d With a final glare at Bai Xiaochun, he did a final check to make sure the spell formation was working, then flew away. Having no other choice, he had finally resorted to using this place to try to grind away some of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mischievousness.</p><br/><p>Of course, deep down, he truly cared for him, and was careful to make sure the spell formation was in good order. Based on his understanding of Bai Xiaochun, he was certain that he wouldn\u2019t step out of the spell formation.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun appeared to be on the verge of tears as he watched Li Qinghou leave. Moments later, without the pressure from Li Qinghou to suppress them, the snakes started to slither about here and there. They bared their fangs, and even tried to break through the spell formation shield, sending venom splattering about in all directions.</p><br/><p>Further off in the distance were some snakes in the eighth level of Qi Condensation who eyed Bai Xiaochun coldly, almost as if they wished to swallow him up. Bai Xiaochun began to pant.</p><br/><p>\u201cThose are bloodgod cobras! I can\u2019t believe they're in the eighth level of Qi Condensation. One drop of their venom could kill ten thousand people!\u201d</p><br/><p>Heart pounding with fear, he looked around a bit more, and realized that there were three snakes who were comparable to the ninth level of Qi Condensation, and there were even two in the great circle.</p><br/><p>The fluctuations that emanated from them were not the same as those from cultivators. These were deadly venomous snakes!</p><br/><p>Most heart-pounding of all was that there was one set of fluctuations that seemed even more powerful than the rest. And all of them seemed to be staring at him.</p><br/><p>Soon, the sky outside grew dark, and Bai Xiaochun sat there, sighing miserably.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do I do now...?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

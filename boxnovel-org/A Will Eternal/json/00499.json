The expression on his face remained as cold as ever, and his energy continued to surge as he waved his hand and called out in a hoarse voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s go! I'm taking you back to the Great Wall!\u201d</p><br/><p>As his words entered the ears of the surrounding cultivators, they began to tremble.</p><br/><p>In their moment of helplessness, surrounded by savages and faced with the prospect of almost certain death, what they wished for more than anything was to get back to the Great Wall. Of course, all of them knew that doing such a thing on their own was virtually impossible.</p><br/><p>That was especially true when they saw so many of their comrades falling in battle. To be in a situation like that, only to have someone offer to lead them back to the Great Wall, someone who the giants were terrified of and who seemed actually capable of following through on his words... led to a sensation they would never ever forget. The gratitude which rose up within them was intense to an indescribable degree!</p><br/><p><em>Who else wants to die!?!?</em> The words so recently uttered by Bai Xiaochun were still echoing in their hearts, which were now pulsing, not with anxiety, but with anticipation. Without any hesitation, they began to form up protectively around Bai Xiaochun, their eyes shining with hope and the desire to live.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet's go!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said. \u201cWe kill anybody who tries to get in our way! Join our voices together so that more cultivators can join us on our way back! Even if we don\u2019t make it all the way back, we\u2019ll make sure that everyone in this part of the world remembers our battle cry for the rest of their lives!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s voice was like the last bit of hope in the world, and it caused the surrounding hundreds of cultivators\u2019 eyes to shine bright red.</p><br/><p>After Bai Xiaochun was satisfied that the cultivators were sufficiently worked up, he waved his arm, gritted his teeth, he stepped forward to lead the formation, which was the best way to control the power of the group. And then, even as he and the rest of the cultivators hovered right within the jaws of death, he shouted out at the top of his lungs and burst into motion toward the distant spell formation shield!</p><br/><p>\u201cAdvance!\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of the cultivators also began to shout out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAdvance!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAdvance!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hundreds of them clustered around Bai Xiaochun, adding their power to the formation as they shot like a deadly spear across the battlefield.</p><br/><p>As they moved along, the savage giants immediately backed up, convinced that if they didn\u2019t, they would die. That feeling was especially bolstered by the savagery Bai Xiaochun had just put on display.</p><br/><p>All of them knew that if they simply fell upon him with wave upon wave... they would eventually overwhelm him with numbers.</p><br/><p>And yet... not a single one blocked his path. The hundreds of cultivators shot across the battlefield with Bai Xiaochun in the lead, who relied only on his fleshly body power, and didn\u2019t draw upon a single magical technique.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was a reason for that. In his opinion, there were obviously a lot of people who were aiming to kill him, and thus, he needed to keep his spiritual power in reserve as a trump card. Thankfully, his Undying Live Forever Technique came with shocking restorative powers, and as such, he was able to lead the cultivators forward without any resistance!</p><br/><p>They crushed anything in their path like a hammer crushing an ice cube. As for the cultivators he led, they had grasped onto that last bit of hope, and were willing to give their all to make sure that no one even got close enough to take it away.</p><br/><p>As they barreled forward, their voices rang out for everyone to hear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho else wants to die!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoists of the five legions, join us and get back home!!\u201d More and more cultivators who were locked in deadly combat on the battlefield did everything they could to join the group, which was now growing larger and larger. Soon, it didn\u2019t number in the hundreds, but rather, the thousands.</p><br/><p>As a result, their momentum picked up, and they became even harder to resist!</p><br/><p>They were now a major focus on the battlefield, to the point where the cultivators who had managed to stay in place on the Great Wall could see them. Even Chen Hetian caught a glimpse of them, and was instantly moved.</p><br/><p>\u201cUnleash all the power of the eye!\u201d he bellowed. \u201cFocus the spell formation shield to extract Bai Xiaochun!\u201d In response to his words, numerous beams of light shot out from the enormous eye, screaming through the air to clear a path for Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>As for the spell formation shield, it trembled as a small section bulged out and began to spread across the battlefield toward the group he was leading.</p><br/><p>By this point, more and more tribal chiefs were paying attention to what was happening.</p><br/><p>Finally, the red-garbed young woman fighting Chen Hetian suddenly shouted, \u201cKill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Hetian roared in anger and attacked with full force, but other than that, could do nothing but watch as the thousands of soul cultivators who were standing guard over the necromancers suddenly turned their heads in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>A large number of them then rose to their feet, becoming beams of light that shot toward Bai Xiaochun and the cultivators he led. They moved with incredible speed, and despite the fact that they were made up of all sorts of handsome men and beautiful women, from the mysterious light that shone in their eyes, it was obvious that they possessed powerful soul magic.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had heard Chen Hetian\u2019s words earlier, and saw both the beams of light shooting out from the enormous eye and the spell formation reaching out to meet him. Even as excitement rose up in his heart, the red-garbed young woman called out her orders, and whistling sounds filled the air as numerous soul cultivators shot in his direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cComplete and utter bullies!!\u201d he thought, his anxiety mounting. Just when the chance to escape was right in front of him, these people were rushing to block his path, and as a result, his anger began to burn.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrothers, cut down those soul cultivators. With them out of the way, we can return to the Great Wall!\u201d The surrounding thousands of cultivators could see exactly what Bai Xiaochun meant, and all began to shout out battle cries.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the soul cultivators didn\u2019t come alone. By utilizing some unknown technique, they forced the retreating giants\u2019 eyes to suddenly turn blank, as if they had suddenly lost their ability to think. Then the giants roared and joined the charge. It was the same with the various battle beasts.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, not all of the giants were affected, only some of them. Even still, the group that did join in the attack was not small compared to Bai Xiaochun and the cultivators he led.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the soul cultivators were on them, some of them focusing on Bai Xiaochun, and others attacking the men with him. Almost immediately, the troop formation began to fall apart.</p><br/><p>A middle-aged soul cultivator suddenly faded into being right in front of Bai Xiaochun, his eyes shining with cold light as his right hand flashed with an incantation gesture. Instantly, green strands of flame sprang into being in his palm, which shot toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Behind him were seven additional soul cultivators, none of them slower than him. Apparently, all the first soul cultivator planned to do was slow Bai Xiaochun down to give his fellows time to finish him off.</p><br/><p>Further off in the distance were even more soul cultivators, dozens of them, spreading out to try to cut down all possible paths of escape for Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWanna kill me?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun shouted, his eyes flickering with madness. Instead of trying to dodge out of the way of the expressionless middle-aged soul cultivator, Bai Xiaochun charged forward, seemingly oblivious to his own life or death. He slammed into the man, instantly causing blood to ooze out of his own mouth, but then didn\u2019t hesitate to unleash the Mountain Shaking Bash. Instantly, the man was shoved backward with deadly force into the group of seven incoming soul cultivators.</p><br/><p>This sudden development caused the seven soul cultivators\u2019 eyes to flicker. Without any hesitation, they shoved their hands out, sending seven illusory soul dragons roaring toward Bai Xiaochun as if to consume him.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust what I've been waiting for!\u201d Bai Xiaochun roared. Instantly, blue light appeared in his pupils, and before anything else could happen, heaven-shaking, earth-shattering frigid qi erupted out!</p><br/><p>Frigid School Will Evolving Incantation!</p><br/><p>Although the frigid qi was not quite at the Frigid Paragon level, it was very close!</p><br/><p>The frigid qi instantly spread for thousands of meters, causing all savages and soul cultivators within that area to begin to tremble as they iced over. The giants were especially affected.</p><br/><p>As for the soul cultivators, their expression flickered; this turn of events completely surpassed their power of prediction. Especially shocked were the soul cultivators closest to Bai Xiaochun, who were stunned to find that their cultivation bases were freezing up.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, an area thousands of meters across had become like the dead of winter. Icy coldness filled the area, as well as astonishing frigid qi. Everything was frozen over to the point where... blue snowflakes appeared and began to fall.</p><br/><p>Although Bai was trembling with fear and anxiety, he was also grittily fierce as he said, \u201cTime to do some killing!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had no desire to die, and therefore, the only option now... was to kill the enemy!</p><br/><p>This was a frigid domain!</p><br/><p>This was... Bai Xiaochun\u2019s world!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

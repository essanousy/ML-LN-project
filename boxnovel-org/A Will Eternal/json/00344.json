That was even more meaningful considering that the River-Defying Sect had come from the Lower Reaches. To the sects subservient to the other three major sects, new doors had suddenly been opened.</p><br/><p>At the same time, the River-Defying Sect was now busier than it had ever been before. Regardless of the level of their cultivation bases, the disciples of all four divisions were mobilized to aid in the construction of a new sect headquarters.</p><br/><p>That new River-Defying Sect headquarters was being built on the former location of the Sky River Court itself!</p><br/><p>The patriarchs of the four divisions had long since discussed and come to an agreement regarding how it would be laid out and what it would look like. Not only did their plan fulfil the requirements of each of the four divisions, it put the sect in the perfect position to both defend and attack. After all, this new headquarters would need to stand for thousands upon thousands of years, and would be a source of glory and honor for the entire sect!</p><br/><p>The nucleus of the headquarters was to be an enormous mountain, half of which rested beneath the surface of the Heavenspan River, and the other half of which rose high into the heavens!</p><br/><p>Although one might think that such a mountain would impede the flow of the Heavenspan River water, various magical means would be used to ensure that the river continued to flow just as before.</p><br/><p>The mountain would stretch high into the clouds, so tall that it was impossible to see the summit.</p><br/><p>As for the name of the mountain, it would be called Mount River Defiance! That mountain would be the nucleus of the sect, where all the important decisions would be made. The patriarchs would live there, and the reserve powers would be held there as well.</p><br/><p>Mount River Defiance would form the center of the sect, with four majestic mountain ranges stretching out from it in four directions. Transported into the area by powerful magics, each one would stretch out for 500 kilometers, and would feature eight peaks that, despite being impressively tall, did not rival Mount River Defiance.</p><br/><p>Those four mountain ranges would be assigned to the four divisions of the River-Defying Sect, the Spirit, Blood, Profound, and Pill Stream Divisions!</p><br/><p>The main gate of the River-Defying Sect would face the Heavenspan River, and would be guarded by two enormous figures. On the left there would be a towering giant that thrummed with powerful blood qi, and yet appeared to be sleeping, which would be none other than the Blood Ancestor! On the right side would be the Dire Skybanyan, standing guard over the River-Defying Sect just like the giant.</p><br/><p>The towering tree and the enormous giant would cause all other smaller sects in the Middle Reaches to cower in fear and terror.</p><br/><p>The planned layout of the River-Defying Sect seemed simple, but the truth was that much thought had been put into it. For example, a grand spell formation would be erected to defend the sect, a spell formation that was ten times larger than the one the Spirit Stream Sect had created years ago in the Luochen Mountains.</p><br/><p>This was the type of enormous sect that deserved to occupy the Middle Reaches, a sect that was clearly so powerful that none of the other forces in the region would dare to trifle with it.</p><br/><p>The River-Defying Sect sent emissaries back to the Lower Reaches with new regulations for the four sects which had risen up in their absence. The old customs were reinstated; in the past, the four great sects of the Lower Reaches had sent tribute upriver every year. The same arrangement would continue into the future.</p><br/><p>The River-Defying Sect also locked down the borders of the Lower Reaches, ensuring that the new sects would have time to fully establish themselves and not face any outside invaders.</p><br/><p>While the shocking memory of the destruction of the Sky River Court was still fresh in the minds of all, this first Dharmic decree issued by the River-Defying Sect was something that no one was willing to defy, not even the other three major Middle Reaches sects. No one wanted to incur the ill will of the River-Defying Sect.</p><br/><p>Although the River-Defying Sect was weaker than the other three major sects, they had received approval from the presiding sect upriver. As such, the other sects couldn\u2019t very well offend them before they even had a chance to establish themselves.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the River-Defying Sect\u2019s territory was peaceful and calm, although the population was filled with both excitement and nervousness.</p><br/><p>The River-Defying Sect had many important affairs to attend to. Whether it was the construction of their new headquarters, the pacification of the Lower Reaches, or the task of bringing their new territory under control, there were countless tasks that required careful attention.</p><br/><p>The first matter to take care of was to assign a mountain range to each of the four divisions. Once each division had a mountain range, they could go about setting it up according to their own styles and requirements.</p><br/><p>Because of Bai Xiaochun, the Spirit Stream Division took the east mountain range. There were few changes to their division. The same seven mountain peaks remained that had once been on the north and south banks of the river. The only difference was that the eighth mountain now belonged to the Core Formation cultivators.</p><br/><p>The mountain range occupied by the Blood Stream Division was the one closest to the Blood Ancestor, which would ensure that the cultivators there were able to practice their techniques with the least interference possible. Another new rule was instituted; in order to become a blood master of one of their eight mountain peaks, a cultivator had to reach Core Formation first!</p><br/><p>As for the Profound and Pill Stream Divisions, they had similar rules as before. The Profound Stream Division specialized in spell formations and clone cultivation, whereas the Pill Stream Division focused on the Dao of medicine. When all was said and done, the River-Defying Sect had a strong foundation in virtually all aspects; they truly met the requirements for a large sect!</p><br/><p>The construction efforts all proceeded with great fanfare.</p><br/><p>There was also much work to be done on what had once been the battlefield surrounding the Sky River Court. The corpses of many River-Defying sect cultivators who had died in battle needed to be cleared away.</p><br/><p>Those cultivators were given proper burials, and their names were inscribed to be remembered for all time. They were brave heroes of the River-Defying Sect whose names would be sung in songs for generation to come.</p><br/><p>There were many, many tasks to accomplish. Now that the fighting was done, one of the main matters at hand was to select a new sect leader. Thankfully, such matters were the responsibility of the patriarchs; Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t have to worry about them.</p><br/><p>Days passed, and soon Bai Xiaochun realized that everyone around him was busy in some way or another. Whenever he walked around, the disciples of the River-Defying Sect would cast reverent gazes in his direction, and offer formal greetings. At first, it felt wonderful, but soon, the thrill began to fade.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is so boring,\u201d he murmured. \u201cI think I\u2019ll go chat with Xiaomei.\u201d It took a bit of searching, but he soon found her. She was with a team of fellow cultivators operating a spell formation giant to clear away rubble.</p><br/><p>As soon as he saw her, he called out, \u201cXiaomei--\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t bother me now, big bro Xiaochun,\u201d she called out, wiping the sweat from her brow. \u201cI'm busy.\u201d With that, she continued on with her work.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun stood there awkwardly for a moment before catching sight of Big Fatty Zhang.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Brother--\u201d</p><br/><p>Big Fatty Zhang looked over with a serious expression, then said, \u201cCan you save it for later, Xiaochun? I have a bunch of spirit enhancing to do....\u201d With that, he went back to his work with Xu Meixiang and the other spirit enhancers.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun smiled, but inside he felt embarrassed and even crestfallen. Just when he was about to leave, he noticed Hou Yunfei flying in his direction.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Bro Hou--\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo time to chat, Xiaochun. Master sent me to work on the Magic Pavilion....\u201d Hou Yunfei flew by without even stopping.</p><br/><p>Smiling wryly, Bai Xiaochun looked around at the people bustling about, and then decided to head to the Blood Stream Division. As soon as he set foot on the mountains, he saw Song Junwan commanding a group of Middle Peak disciples as they constructed a new Middle Peak.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Sis Song--\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo hang out somewhere else, Nightcrypt!\u201d she barked, flicking her sleeve. Then she issued some more orders to the Middle Peak disciples.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s jaw dropped. Even as he was trying to decide how to respond, a quavering voice reached his ears from behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior patriarch, do you mind just leaving? You\u2019re making me nervous....\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun felt like he was about to go mad. Sighing, he turned and moped off.</p><br/><p>Everyone he knew was ignoring him because of the various tasks they had been assigned. Even Bruiser had been given an assignment, and was overseeing some of the battle beasts.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun felt like he was the only idle person in the entire River-Defying Sect. The only people who qualified to give him orders were the Nascent Soul patriarchs, and they were all busy with important matters. In fact, it was even possible to occasionally catch wind of the sounds of arguing and discussion coming from Mount River Defiance.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe elites usually do the most work, but apparently a person as incredible as me, a junior patriarch, actually ends up with nothing to do....\u201d Completely incapable of thinking of any important tasks to attend to, he could only sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh whatever. I guess I should go concoct some medicine....\u201d After finding his way to the bank of the Heavenspan River, he found a good location, sat down cross-legged, and began to think back to what he had learned from the true spirit about the River-Defying Pill.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe gave me some good fortune, so I should definitely try to concoct that pill!\u201d Gradually, he sank down into the calm that came with seeking enlightenment, and began to analyze the formula for the River-Defying Pill.</p><br/><p>Time passed. Soon, night had fallen. Although the River-Defying Sect cultivators were all very busy, it was customary to rest at night, so soon, all heaven and earth grew quiet.</p><br/><p>Most of the corpses on the battlefield had been cleared away, although a few remained here and there.</p><br/><p>At the moment, the moon hung high in the sky, illuminating all of the lands down below. But then, a dark cloud appeared, which slowly spread out, casting darkness everywhere. Then, a white-robed figure appeared out of thin air.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

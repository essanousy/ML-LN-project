At the moment, his mind was empty of anything other than thinking of ways to buy time.</p><br/><p>When Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s palm attack hit the Eternal Parasol, a massive boom filled the air. Cracking sounds could be heard, as if the Eternal Parasol couldn\u2019t sustain the force. Fissures appeared on its surface, and the ghost face twisted as if in agony.</p><br/><p>The parasol was then ripped out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand and sent tumbling to the side. There was no time for him to think about retrieving it as he was sent flying backward, blood spraying out of his mouth. The shield layers created by his paper talismans were so thick that they almost didn\u2019t fit inside of the sepulcher, and when Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s palm slammed into them, the result was astonishing.</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUMBLE!</p><br/><p>One by one, the paper talismans were destroyed, and the shield layers fell apart. However, Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s palm attack also began to fade. Within the space of a few breaths of time, both the shields and the talismans were spent, and Bai Xiaochun was still falling back, the power of a Godly Vestige Pill sweeping through him and healing him.</p><br/><p>Although this exchange seemed relatively simple, if Bai Lin had been there to see it, his heart would have twinged with pain. It was as if Bai Xiaochun had just defended himself with a big stack of money!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face was as pale as a sheet of paper. Even as he backed away from Mistress Red-Dust, and did everything he could to buy time, he continued to pepper her with insults.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey Harlot Red-Dust, do you see now how hard it is to kill Lord Bai? You just wait until I become a demigod, then I\u2019ll come for revenge!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!!\u201d Mistress Red-Dust cursed angrily. She had already attacked multiple times, and had not been able to kill Bai Xiaochun. Furthermore, the teleportation power in the area was building up to a peak. Eyes flashing with the desire to kill, she sent red mist swirling around to form a tempest that began to block up the holes in the walls of the sepulcher!!</p><br/><p>Although the mist was rapidly corroded, it gave Mistress Red-Dust the few breaths of time free from the shafts of light that she needed to build up the full power of her cultivation base. Then, she prepared to unleash a blow that she was sure would kill Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>She had long since noticed that the shafts of light didn\u2019t affect Bai Xiaochun, and yet were extremely bothersome and dangerous to her. Obviously, she had fallen into a trap laid by Bai Xiaochun, all of which centered around the script on the stone stele.</p><br/><p>After blocking the holes on the walls, Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s eyes glittered, and she took a step toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>As her foot fell, the air around her sunk in, creating something that looked like a huge, sinister mouth. Then, a powerful gravitational force sprang out, grabbing onto Bai Xiaochun and dragging him toward the mouth.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was scared out of his mind, and quickly performed an incantation gesture with both hands. Then he waved his finger toward the mouth and shouted, \u201cWaterswamp!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the entire sepulcher twisted and distorted as water vapor roiled out everywhere, turning the entire area into a watery swamp!</p><br/><p>Next, a terrifying aura erupted out, something that seemed to come from primordial times. Time and space both seemed affected, as if the entire area within that swamp now existed in ancient times!</p><br/><p>Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s pupils constricted.</p><br/><p>Before she could do anything, though, Bai Xiaochun shouted, \u201cKingdom!\u201d</p><br/><p>Instantly, five mountain-like spikes began to rise up from within the watery swamp, shooting straight toward Mistress Red-Dust.</p><br/><p>However, Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t even pause for a moment. Leaping into the air, he roared, \u201cLiving Mountain Incantation!\u201d</p><br/><p>After directly transforming into a 30-meter-tall stone golem, he joined the Waterswamp Kingdom spikes in a merciless attack on Mistress Red-Dust.</p><br/><p>In response to the Waterswamp Kingdom, Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s eyes shone with a curious light. And yet, a moment later she chuckled coldly.</p><br/><p>\u201cA very mysterious magical technique. I'm not sure which sect you come from to have a divine spirit beast guardian like that. It\u2019s too bad... that you can\u2019t fully summon it. And even if you could, I wouldn't give you the time to do so. First, I'm going to kill this creature, then I'm going to kill you!\u201d Even as the words left her mouth, Mistress Red-Dust performed an incantation gesture and sent red mist roiling out from her palm. In the briefest of moments, it transformed into a long red spear that she thrust, not toward the incoming spikes, but toward the ground where the actual watery swamp was located.</p><br/><p>The red spear stabbed down toward the space below, piercing into whatever world lay beneath, and the creature inside, the creature which even Bai Xiaochun had never seen.</p><br/><p>Subsequently, a roar of rage echoed out from below, causing Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s spear to shatter. Even the sinister mouth she had formed with her magical technique collapsed. At the same time, the five mountain-like spikes continued to shoot up from below!!</p><br/><p>The were not straight, but rather curved, and if one looked at them for more than a moment, one would be struck by how they resembled the claws of some beast. However, they were so enormous that those mere claws were like mountains. Furthermore, the creature appeared to be enraged by Mistress Red-Dust, and was trying to get out of the watery swamp to reach her....</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation base wasn\u2019t strong enough to support the Waterswamp Kingdom. As the clawed hand stretched out, blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he let out a shriek as he felt his cultivation base and life force being ripped at violently. Clearly, the power required to fully allow the clawed hand to appear in the open was enough to completely wither him to death.... Terrified, he had no choice but to dispel his own magical technique, and dissipate the power of the Waterswamp Kingdom....</p><br/><p>Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s expression flickered into one of shock as she staggered backward. \u201cWhat was that thing!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face was just as ashen as Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s. He knew that his Waterswamp Kingdom was powerful, but had never realized it was <em>this</em> powerful. The claws on one of the creature\u2019s hands had been enough to nearly kill him. As he contemplated the fact that if he wasn't careful using the Waterswamp Kingdom, he could get himself killed, he shivered....</p><br/><p>Even more depressing was how fanatically crazy Mistress Red-Dust was acting. What was the deal with that? All she had to do was follow through with his plan and attack the mountain-like spikes, whereupon he could have blocked her path and even used his Living Mountain Incantation.</p><br/><p>Instead, the Waterswamp Kingdom was now gone, and he was stuck out in the open in his stone golem form. The only upside was that by this point, the holes in the wall had destroyed the red mist, and the shafts of light were now shooting toward Mistress Red-Dust.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun knew that time was running out for him. Therefore, he let out a shout and sped toward Mistress Red-Dust like a meteor!</p><br/><p>Just as Mistress Red-Dust was recovering from her shock at the enormous creature she had just had a brush with, the shafts of light returned. Anger immediately burned in her heart; were it not for those shafts of light, she would never have had so much difficulty killing Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>However, the shafts of light, and the red welts they left on her skin, caused intense pain, and required significant effort to suppress. Furthermore, the slightest lapse of attention on her part could lead to permanent consequences.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was turning out to be incredibly resilient. Plus, he had all sorts of random items and techniques to keep him going. Finally, Mistress Red-Dust barked out a cold laugh, and then glared at Bai Xiaochun with more killing intent than ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re running out of time!\u201d Taking a deep breath, she yet again ignored the red welts and abandoned the use of the red mist to defend herself. Performing an incantation gesture, she summoned another long, red spear, and hurled it toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>That spear contained the true power of a deva!</p><br/><p>In the same instant that the spear flew out into the air, Bai Xiaochun produced an arrow. It was... the fire soul arrow that had received an elevenfold spirit enhancement! Treating his body like the bow and his arm like the bowstring, he viciously hurled the arrow toward Mistress Red-Dust.</p><br/><p>The fire soul arrow pierced through the air with numerous cracking sounds, the shocking golden designs on its surface shining brightly. In the blink of an eye, it reached the red spear, and the two of them collided, unleashing a deafening boom.</p><br/><p>Normally speaking, the red spear would have been far too powerful for the fire soul arrow to deal with. However, it was in that moment that Bai Xiaochun shouted, \u201cDetonate!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

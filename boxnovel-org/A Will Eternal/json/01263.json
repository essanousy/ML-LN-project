But as the Arch-Ancestor rose to his feet, Bai Xiaochun realized that his head nearly touched the \u2018sky\u2019 above.</p><br/><p>His size, his expressionless face, his cold eyes, and the explosive power that radiated off of his fleshly body made it seem like any attack he unleashed could shake the foundations of worlds! In fact, he seemed strong enough to destroy the energy passageway itself!</p><br/><p>Even the mere motion of standing up caused a gale-force wind to spread out, blasting away all of the shadowy specters in the area, and completely wiping most of them out of existence.</p><br/><p>He was strong, mighty, vicious, and explosive!</p><br/><p>Those were the only four words Bai Xiaochun could think of to accurately describe the Arch-Ancestor.</p><br/><p>Gasping, he subconsciously backed up a few steps, heart pounding. Even the mere blood and energy fluctuations coming off of the Arch-Ancestor were enough to affect the blood-colored light shining off of Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>It was as if\u2026 the Arch-Ancestor were vying with Bai Xiaochun for control over the bloodline sealing strip. Thankfully, this Arch-Ancestor was a mere incarnation, and did not actually have the qualifications to destroy the sealing strip. Otherwise it would have long since been wiped away.</p><br/><p>And yet, Bai Xiaochun still felt a profound sensation of deadly crisis!!</p><br/><p>Most of the time, the sensations of crisis he would experience came because of a lack of information regarding his enemy. But in this case, the sensation rose up because he was facing his own blood ancestor.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat must be what happened earlier. The Saint-Emperor must have encountered the Saint-Ancestor\u2026 and lost!\u201d Although it was only speculation, he was at least seventy to eighty percent sure that it was true.</p><br/><p>\u201cFighting one\u2019s own founding ancestor?\u201d Even as Bai Xiaochun felt a rising sense of inferiority and frustration, the Arch-Ancestor\u2019s eyes began to glow with the desire to do battle. They were like twin suns as he started walking forward, causing huge booms to echo out as he headed in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>As he picked up speed, Bai Xiaochun realized that he wasn\u2019t just running forward casually, he was attempting\u2026 to bash into him!</p><br/><p>\u201cMountain Shaking Bash!\u201d he thought, his pupils constricting. Being as familiar with the Undying Codex as he was, he instantly recognize the magical technique the Arch-Ancestor was using. He could also sense the fluctuations of the Undying Hex, and even worse, noticed a terrifying light shining on the Arch-Ancestor\u2019s right index finger and thumb!</p><br/><p>\u201cThroat Crushing Grasp!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun had absolutely no desire to be hit by a Throat Crushing Grasp unleashed by the Arch-Ancestor himself. It would likely lead to his tiny frame being crushed into a pile of bloody sludge.</p><br/><p>Mind spinning with a sensation of crisis, he flew backward at top speed. Of course, the Arch-Ancestor was by no means slow, and in the blink of an eye, he was chasing him down through the energy passageway.</p><br/><p>Down below in the Eternal Immortal Domains, gasps could be heard as the light that represented Bai Xiaochun\u2026 suddenly stopped, and then began to move in the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>Sensations of despair rose up in the hearts of all, as everyone suddenly realized that the end of days was approaching!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe definitely encountered the Arch-Ancestor!\u201d the Saint-Emperor thought. Deep in his heart, he itched to help, but knew that he couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Song Junwan, Zhou Zimo, Hou Xiaomei, Li Qinghou, the Grand Heavenmaster, and many other people in the Arch-Emperor Dynasty who knew Bai Xiaochun were all observing with ashen faces, feeling completely powerless.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, booms filled the energy passageway as Bai Xiaochun fell back at top speed. To his dismay, he found that whatever he did, he couldn\u2019t shake the Arch-Ancestor. Eventually, it reached the point where he couldn\u2019t take it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here, Arch-Ancestor!? This level of bullying is flipping ridiculous!!\u201d Eyes widening angrily, he suddenly stopped in place, then launched himself toward the Arch-Ancestor.</p><br/><p>\u201cCloud Lightning Forefather Transformation!\u201d Growing larger, he took three steps forward, until he was 300 meters tall. That was when he used the Living Mountain Incantation, growing taller, to a height of more than 600 meters. And then he unleashed his own Mountain Shaking Bash!</p><br/><p>As he screamed through the air, the Arch-Ancestor shot toward him. And yet, still unhappy with his level of speed, Bai Xiaochun used his Undying Hex.</p><br/><p>Sonic booms erupted everywhere. Bai Xiaochun was now drawing fully on all of the fleshly body power he could muster, and was also bolstering it with his cultivation base, making him even stronger!</p><br/><p>\u201cBring it on!\u201d he shouted. Then, in the last moment before colliding with the Arch-Ancestor, he used the Throat Crushing Grasp!</p><br/><p>They looked like two explosive dragons as they slammed into each other, causing the ground to tremble beneath them. Groups of shadowy specters who had been converging in the area were completely destroyed by the shockwaves which began to roll out!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun howled with rage, and the Arch-Ancestor growled coldly. In a very short time, the two of them exchanged over a thousand blows!</p><br/><p>Slowly but surely, the rocks and stones that made up Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Living Mountain Incantation form were being battered off him. At the same time, his Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformation was weakening. And yet, even in this state, his battle prowess continued to rage!</p><br/><p>As for the Arch-Ancestor, the more than one thousand exchanges left the surface of his body cracked and battered, making him look like he might explode at any moment.</p><br/><p>One final deafening boom echoed out, and then Bai Xiaochun tumbled backward, blood spraying out of his mouth. Thankfully, his Undying Codex was hard at work, and within moments, he lurched to a stop. Righting himself, he shouted, \u201cSo, it turns out you\u2019re just an empty shell!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>To his surprise, he and the Arch-Ancestor weren\u2019t that vastly different after all; the Arch-Ancestor was actually using archaean-level battle prowess. Swallowing a mouthful of blood, Bai Xiaochun unleashed his Godkiller technique, causing radiant, crimson light to swirl around him!</p><br/><p>Looking like a streak of blood mist, he shot toward the Arch-Ancestor!</p><br/><p>However, the Arch-Ancestor was also regenerating using the Undying Codex, causing his wounds to rapidly heal up. Apparently, he was thinking the same thing as Bai Xiaochun, as he also began to glow with red light as he unleashed the Godkiller technique. Moments later, the two of them were once again fighting back and forth.</p><br/><p>Both of them were in bad shape, their hair disheveled, their powers of regeneration working like mad. From the look of it, they were at a deadlock.</p><br/><p>Another huge boom could be heard, and the two of them backed away from each other. At this point, the Arch-Ancestor\u2019s eyes began to glow with bright light, and he reached out with his right hand. Shockingly, his hand began to emanate five different auras. Metal. Wood. Water. Fire. And Earth!</p><br/><p>Those five elements corresponded to the five yin organs inside the human body, as well as five powerful sealing magics. At this point, the Arch-Ancestor\u2019s torso began to shine with five-colored light, light which came from five different specific locations, and was filled with terrifying power!</p><br/><p>\u201cMagic of the five organs?\u201d Bai Xiaochun murmured. \u201cI always thought that the Five Yin Organs Secret Magic that Great-Grandpa Gravekeeper used all those years ago had something to do with the Undying Codex. Who would have thought\u2026 that in addition to the volumes of skin, flesh, tendon, bone, and blood, the Arch-Ancestor would also create a sixth volume of the Undying Codex!?\u201d If Bai Xiaochun hadn\u2019t been given the opportunity to fight this battle, he would never have known that there weren\u2019t just five volumes to the Undying Codex. There were six!</p><br/><p>It was very similar to how he had created his own additional technique to complete the Undying Live Forever Technique. The technique the gravekeeper had used in his fight with Daoist Heavenspan\u2026 was actually powered by the five yin organs of the Arch-Ancestor!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

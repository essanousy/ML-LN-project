Although it couldn\u2019t be said that he had copious amounts of experience fighting devas, he had fought more than a few during his time in the Wildlands.</p><br/><p>Whether it was the three patriarchs in Giant Ghost City, the heavenly dukes in Arch-Emperor City, Mistress Red-Dust, who he had fought on more than one occasion, or even that spectacular battle of battles, they had all had a very profound effect on him.</p><br/><p>It was because of all that experience that he actually didn\u2019t feel very apprehensive when facing devas. Furthermore, as he prepared to fight these two devas, his mind was alive with various thoughts.</p><br/><p>His thoughts moved so quickly that he was virtually acting on instinct. He could immediately sense that, although he could fight these two, it would be dangerous. Furthermore, if they attempted to distract him by attacking and killing other disciples in the area, the consequences could be dire, to say the least.</p><br/><p>In fact, if the three of them had done that from the very beginning, things might have turned out very differently. Even if Bai Xiaochun had been more confident than he was, it would have been a difficult situation to deal with. After all, this was the River-Defying Sect; Bai Xiaochun could not simply flee the battlefield, whereas his opponents could.</p><br/><p>That was one reason why he had attacked like lightning and crippled one of his opponents right off the bat!</p><br/><p>Now there were only two devas left, and yet, he still had many concerns to deal with.</p><br/><p>The entire River-Defying Sect was a battlefield now, with booms and bangs echoing out everywhere. It was only by achieving a spectacular and decisive victory in the first exchange that he could inspire the cultivators of the River-Defying Sect, and shake the hearts of the three sects.</p><br/><p>All of these things occupied his thoughts. However, by this point in his life, he had developed exceptional awareness of how to do battle, and therefore, it was without the slightest hesitation that, as the two devas closed in on him, he utilized his Undying Hex. He suddenly moved with a speed that surpassed teleportation, veering away from Patriarch Starry River and bearing down on Patriarch Polarity River.</p><br/><p>At the same time, he opened his third eye, and rotated his cultivation base at full measure, focusing his Heavenspan Dharma Eye directly on Patriarch Starry River.</p><br/><p>That patriarch shivered physically as the shocking power of gravitational repulsion became like fetters, like a giant invisible hand that grabbed him and held him in place!</p><br/><p>As Patriarch Starry River\u2019s face fell because of the shocking effects of the magical eye, Bai Xiaochun approached Patriarch Polarity River with lightning speed!</p><br/><p>Patriarch Starry River had his black mist incarnated as a starry sky filled with heavenly bodies and asteroids. It was something that could affect a wide area, and although it wasn\u2019t necessarily a big threat to Bai Xiaochun, he knew that if the patriarch turned it onto the River-Defying Sect disciples, the consequences would be unimaginable!</p><br/><p>As for the devilish god that the Polarity River Court deva had summoned, it had shocking battle prowess, and yet Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t even pause for thought before rushing in that very direction!</p><br/><p>Everything happened in the mere blink of an eye. As soon as Patriarch Starry River was locked down, Bai Xiaochun accelerated rapidly, arriving right in front of Patriarch Polarity River. There, he clenched his hand into a fist and unleashed a fist strike.</p><br/><p>The fist strike shook heaven and earth, unleashing explosive fleshly body power in a massive whirlwind that bore down on the patriarch!</p><br/><p>The patriarch\u2019s face fell. Howling, he performed an incantation gesture, causing the devilish god to take a step forward and merge with him! Then, devil qi erupted out wildly, forming a buckler which he thrust out to defend himself.</p><br/><p>A boom rang out as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fist made contact with the buckler of devil qi. The buckler emitted cracking sounds for a short moment before collapsing, and yet, even as it did, a second buckler appeared, and then a third.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had no time for thought or planning. Instead of backing up, he performed an incantation gesture and lunged forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cLiving Mountain Incantation!\u201d</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUMBLE!!</p><br/><p>Countless rocks and stones in the area flew up into the air, forming around Bai Xiaochun until he was an enormous stone golem!</p><br/><p>He was now hundreds of meters tall and bursting with heaven-shaking, earth-shattering energy. In addition, the Living Mountain Incantation augmented his fleshly body power, making him seem supremely disdainful of everything in sight. Striking out with his fist, he destroyed the second buckler, as well as the third and the fourth.</p><br/><p>Shock covered the face of Patriarch Polarity River because of how quickly everything was happening. Before he could do anything else, Bai Xiaochun, still in Living Mountain Incantation form, unleashed his Mountain Shaking Bash.</p><br/><p>As the devil-form Patriarch Polarity River lunged backward, Patriarch Starry River struggled furiously against the bonds which held him. Finally, they broke, and he prepared to join in on fighting Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>However, that was when Bai Xiaochun suddenly looked over his shoulder, once again focusing the gaze of his Heavenspan Dharma Eye on Patriarch Starry River.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as, to the madness and frustration of the patriarch, he was once again locked in place by this vile opponent. As he struggled, Bai Xiaochun continued onward toward Patriarch Polarity River, using the Living Mountain Incantation to full effect in another attack.</p><br/><p>Bangs rang out as, in the blink of an eye, Bai Xiaochun unleashed dozens of punches, all of which landed on Patriarch Polarity River\u2019s devilish god form. Again and again he was shoved backward, slowly pushing him away from Patriarch Starry River.</p><br/><p>It was a profoundly shocking sight that had many observing cultivators reeling, not only from Bai Xiaochun\u2019s shocking display of power, but from how instinctively he fought!</p><br/><p>In the shortest of moments, he had used magical power to lock down one opponent, and fleshly body power to unleash devastating force on another!</p><br/><p>Patriarch Polarity River was teetering on the verge of insanity. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s devastating windstorm of an attack had his qi and blood in chaos. Blood oozed out of the corners of his mouth, and yet, things were not over yet! Just when he was about to prepare a counter attack, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered, and he let out a powerful shout.</p><br/><p>As he did, his Living Mountain Incantation form collapsed, and all of the rocks shot out in front of him to create a gigantic fist. It was that fist that landed onto Patriarch Polarity River\u2019s devilish god form!</p><br/><p>An ear-splitting boom filled the battlefield. The devilish god body shattered, revealing the patriarch\u2019s true self, blood spraying out of his mouth, his expression that of shock. At this point, Bai Xiaochun again turned and unleashed the power of his Heavenspan Dharma Eye, reinforcing the bonds locking down Patriarch Starry River, who had been just about to free himself!</p><br/><p>Patriarch Starry River was filled with indescribable anxiety and frustration. He immediately began to resort to any means necessary, even those that caused dangerous backlashes, to try to escape. Aware that he wasn\u2019t a match for Bai Xiaochun, he knew that his only chance was to start attacking the bystanders in the hopes of distracting him.</p><br/><p>However, it was in that very moment that intense killing intent flickered in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes. Taking another step toward Patriarch Polarity River, he performed an incantation gesture with his right hand and then waved his finger, yet again summoning his frigid domain.</p><br/><p>The entire 500-kilometer area iced over, and nine shadowy projections appeared, which slashed toward Patriarch Polarity River like nine sharp blades.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a useless bastard, Patriarch Starry River!!!\u201d Patriarch Polarity River screamed. The two patriarchs had agreed to work together, but Patriarch Starry River had been bound in place multiple times, making it completely impossible for him to help. As a result, Patriarch Polarity River had come to hate Patriarch Starry River even more than he hated Bai Xiaochun\u2026.</p><br/><p>Unlike Patriarch Starry River, he didn\u2019t have a special divine ability to protect his nascent divinity from a deadly attack. If he were to be cut down in battle, he would die beyond the shadow of a doubt. It was a moment of deadly crisis, and as such, madness lit up his eyes. Even as Bai Xiaochun's nine frigid clones closed in on him, he chose to resort to\u2026. fleshly body self-detonation!</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

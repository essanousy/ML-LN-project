Not a single person realized that he was one of the five celestials of the Saint-Emperor Dynasty!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun suddenly realized that keeping a low profiles was great, and in some ways, was better than doing things the normal way.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder a lot of big shots like to secretly mingle with the common people. It's a really wonderful feeling.\u201d It was truly nice to be in a situation like this in which he faced absolutely no danger.</p><br/><p>When the deva saw his seemingly pleased smile, and heard his words, he suddenly got a very strange feeling. However, he didn\u2019t pay too much attention to that feeling.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis shady character is trying to sneak into the capital city!\u201d the deva announced. \u201cArrest him for further inspection. If he checks out, send him on his way, and if he resists, execute him on the spot!\u201d The crowd began to back up even further. Some of them were looking at Bai Xiaochun sympathetically, but more had looks of open scorn.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs this guy an idiot, or what? Who would dare to make a scene right here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy would he do this? That\u2019s Marquis Zi Lin! All he has to do is step to the side. It\u2019s not like they asked him to cut his own arm off or something.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe's finished. Nowadays, anybody who gets arrested like this ends up getting thrown in prison and never coming out again!\u201d Cold gleams appeared in the eyes of the guards, all of whom, with the exception of the one who had already been stunned into immobility by Bai Xiaochun, hurried forward.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun actually hadn\u2019t expected the deva to just immediately have him arrested. A strange expression appeared on his face as he sighed.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of all this? I just wanted to get into the city\u2026. And I was trying to keep a low profile.\u201d Shaking his head, he waved his hand. He didn\u2019t reveal his celestial cultivation base, he just used some nascent soul-level power, one level above these Core Formation guards. A windstorm sprang up, pushing the guards so hard that they were shoved back across the ground. One of them even coughed up some blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat gall!\u201d the deva shouted. \u201cGet on your knees immediately!\u201d Blurring into motion, he shot forward, fueling his hand with a burst of deva power to slap Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>In the deva\u2019s mind, this blow would probably not be deadly, but it would at least force this person onto his knees!</p><br/><p>Derision filled his heart. If this person had simply backed down, he would have just been punished a bit. But since he decided to resist, then it meant he was foolishly asking to be killed. Therefore, the deva\u2019s actions were all in accord with the strict laws of the capital city!</p><br/><p>However, even as the deva\u2019s hand began to move, Bai Xiaochun sighed and sent his right hand flying toward him.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about you kneel instead?\u201d Even as the words left his mouth, a smacking sound filled the air. The deva\u2019s vision swam as a massive, unavoidable force hit him. His mind went blank, and he was nearly deafened. Blood then sprayed out of his mouth as he was smacked out of the air to land hard on the ground, right in front of Bai Xiaochun, his knees shattered, and blood oozing out all over him!</p><br/><p>The intense pain he felt prompted a hoarse scream. He wanted to stand up, but his broken knees wouldn\u2019t permit it. Worse, his cultivation base was teetering on the point of collapse.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the crowd was stunned, and many a gasp could be heard.</p><br/><p>\u201cFine, you\u2019re not a Nascent Soul cultivator!\u201d the deva cried. \u201cBut even if you <em>are</em> a deva, you\u2019re still dead!!\u201d Trying to ignore the intense pain, he pulled out a jade slip, which he crushed.</p><br/><p>Of course, that jade slip acted like an alarm trigger, and instantly caused numerous beams of light to rise up from within the city and head toward the main gate.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was a bit at a loss as to what to do. He had just wanted to enter the city, but had already caused quite a scene. Shaking his head, he turned and prepared to pass through the shield and enter the gate.</p><br/><p>However, before he could move, Marquis Zi Lin, who had been standing off to the side completely silently up to this point, finally spoke.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, his subordinates rushed forth with coldly gleaming eyes. Five devas and more than ten Nascent Soul cultivators all stepped forward, giving rise to shocking energy. For many of the onlookers, this was an incredible scene the likes of which they would rarely be able to see.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a pity you didn\u2019t reveal your deva cultivation base earlier,\u201d Marquis Zi Lin continued. \u201cClearly you\u2019re trying to show off. Finished? My subordinates have all grown up on the battlefield. Each of them have killed more than 10,000 enemies!\u201d</p><br/><p>As some in the crowd sighed about what was surely to come, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s anger flared. After all, he hadn\u2019t caused any trouble for this Marquis Zi Lin. Yet despite that, the man was clearly singling him out.</p><br/><p>\u201cThink you can bully me?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, glaring. He waved his right hand, allowing the power of the great circle of the Deva Realm to sweep out across the incoming subordinates of Marquis Zi Lin. Immediately, their hearts filled with wild shock.</p><br/><p>Deafening rumbling sounds filled their ears, and their vision swam as a mountain-toppling, sea-draining force assailed them. There was literally nothing they could do to defend themselves. The five devas in the lead position coughed up mouthfuls of blood as they were forced to the ground in a kneeling position.</p><br/><p>As for the ten Nascent Soul cultivators, they were even less able to resist. As they slammed into the ground, bloodcurdling screams echoed out in all directions.</p><br/><p>It all happened in the blink of an eye, much to the shock of the onlookers. It was almost unthinkable to see so many powerful cultivators kneeling, right there at the main gate to the city.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow amusing,\u201d Marquis Zi Lin said, his eyes sparkling, and a slight smile of derision appearing on his face. He strode forward, moving so quickly that a massive wind kicked up. Arriving in front of Bai Xiaochun, he unleashed an energy far more terrifying than what Bai Xiaochun had just unleashed. This was not the early Demigod Realm; it was the power of the great circle!</p><br/><p>However, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression remained the same as ever as he reached out with his right hand and casually waved his hand toward Marquis Zi Lin.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou kneel too!\u201d he said coolly. His hand became something like an all-destructive mountain that could crush everything. Marquis Zi Lin seemed like he had been moving quickly, but to Bai Xiaochun, it was nothing more than a snail\u2019s pace. As for the wind he had kicked up, it felt like the breath of a child, and the massive force that caused the air to ripple was so weak he could dispel it with ease!</p><br/><p>That was the difference between demigods and celestials, and showed how vastly superior a Daoseed was.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds echoed out as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s palm hit, not the Marquis Zi Lin there in front of him, but something obscured behind him!</p><br/><p>The air rippled and distorted as a second Marquis Zi Lin stumbled out. That was how Marquis Zi Lin operated. When he appeared in public, he would keep his true self hidden, and have a clone act openly. Of course, demigods in the Heavenspan Realm couldn\u2019t normally create clones, and it was the same for demigods in the Eternal Immortal Domains, which made this strategy particularly effective, and also rare.</p><br/><p>Just now, he had sent his clone over to test Bai Xiaochun a bit!</p><br/><p>Never could he have imagined that his test would be crushed as if by a mountain!</p><br/><p>The buzz of conversation rose up as both Marquis Zi Lin and his clone had their cultivation bases nearly destroyed. The intense force he could now sense caused him to tremble, and his eyes to shine with disbelief. He wanted to ask this person who he was, but before he could, the energy slammed into him, forcing him down. Blood sprayed out of his mouth as well as his clone\u2019s mouth as both of them were slammed into the ground.</p><br/><p>Thud!</p><br/><p>Dust billowed out as the audience looked on, stunned. Marquis Zi Lin\u2019s subordinates were in a daze, but even more shocked was the deva in charge of this gate. Waves of shock battered him as he realized that there was only one explanation for this, as unbelievable as it seemed. As soon as the idea entered his head, it nearly drove him mad!</p><br/><p>\u201cCe\u2026 celestial\u2026.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

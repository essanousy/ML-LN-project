It Wasnt!!!</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>\u201cComplete and utter bullying!? How dare you, Chen Hetian!\u201d Bai Xiaochun roared, clearly not ready to give up. Booms rang out over and over as they began to fight back and forth.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the Chen Clan was completely shocked by what was happening, and the other cultivators watching from other locations were similarly astonished.</p><br/><p>In fact, the other four devas on the blue rainbow sent their divine sense over to watch as well. However, neither Patriarch Steel Veins nor Li Xiandao or Bai Zhentian did anything to interfere.</p><br/><p>Of course, both Li Xiandao and Bai Zhentian were completely taken aback by the fact that Bai Xiaochun had Chen Hetian at a complete disadvantage. Furthermore, because of everything they had witnessed in the River-Defying Sect, both of them were leery of Bai Xiaochun, and currently didn\u2019t dare to get involved.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t have anything to do with us\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was Fellow Daoist Chen thinking? This is Bai Xiaochun\u2019s moment of triumph! What is he doing causing problems for him right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh well. He's the one who went and pissed off Bai Xiaochun, so he\u2019ll just have to resolve the situation on his own.\u201d</p><br/><p>After conferring briefly, both Bai Zhentian and Li Xiandao agreed that it was really Chen Hetian\u2019s fault for being so obtuse.</p><br/><p>As for Chen Hetian, he was on the verge of going completely mad. If he were aware of why Bai Xiaochun was going all out to attack him, he might have been able to deal with the situation. But he really had no idea what was going on, and to make things worse, when he asked Bai Xiaochun to explain, Bai Xiaochun sarcastically responded that he already knew.</p><br/><p>As Bai Xiaochun circled back around for another powerful attack, Chen Hetian gritted his teeth, shot backward, and cried, \u201cDid someone from my clan offend you? Is that what happened? If so, then it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with me!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone from your clan?\u201d Bai Xiaochun shouted. \u201cLike hell! It was you, Chen Hetian! Still trying to act dumb? You think I\u2019m three years old or something!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Hetian wanted to scream out loud in rage. It seemed completely impossible to communicate with Bai Xiaochun, and no matter how he wracked his brains, he couldn\u2019t think of what he had done recently to provoke an insane reaction like this.</p><br/><p>Chen Hetian\u2019s expression couldn\u2019t have been more unsightly as he backed up again. Bai Xiaochun was just too strong, and his defenses were virtually impenetrable. Chen Hetian simply had no way to deal with him.</p><br/><p>It was about this time that an urgent voice rang out from a short distance away.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop it, Xiaochun!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Two beams of light approached, containing a man and woman. They were none other than Zhao Tianjiao and Chen Yueshan.</p><br/><p>Chen Yueshan seemed very anxious, whereas Zhao Tianjiao had a bit of a begrudging expression on his face. As soon as they had heard that Bai Xiaochun was going to see Chen Hetian, they had rushed over. They really had no choice but to come. On the one hand, Bai Xiaochun was their friend, but on the other hand, Chen Hetian was a Master and father to the two of them respectively\u2026.</p><br/><p>If anyone else had come to interfere, Bai Xiaochun would have been able to simply ignore them. But he and Zhao Tianjiao had shared quite a few trials and tribulations. Plus, Zhao Tianjiao had done a lot for the River-Defying Sect, and had even defied Chen Hetian in his attempts to help.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had long considered him a close friend. Therefore, instead of continuing to attack Chen Hetian, he backed up a bit and looked over at Zhao Tianjiao.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, Chen Hetian breathed a sigh of relief. However, he kept a very grim expression on his face as he stared coldly at Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao flew over at top speed, planting himself between Bai Xiaochun and his Master. Looking both anxious and slightly irritated, he said, \u201cXiaochun, you--\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Brother,\u201d Bai Xiaochun interrupted, \u201cyour Master has gone way too far this time. The reason I came here today has nothing to do with the River-Defying Sect. Your Master has committed a wicked and immoral act, and has bullied people to an outrageous degree!!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chen Hetian heard that, he gritted his teeth even harder, and then loudly said, \u201cYou need to explain the situation clearly, Bai Xiaochun. What did I do to you?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou want me to explain clearly?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, glaring back at him. \u201cYou did the deed, and yet you don\u2019t know?! Fine. I\u2019ll just beat the explanation out of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>His energy flared, and he made to advance. However, the irritated Zhao Tianjiao quickly interfered.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaochun!!\u201d he said loudly.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked over at him, and stopped in place.</p><br/><p>\u201cEldest Brother,\u201d he said angrily, \u201cthis doesn\u2019t have anything to do with you. Your Master has really just gone way overboard. Remember Big Fatty Zhang? And Xu Baocai? They\u2019re good friends of mine, and fellow disciples to the both of us. However, your Master kidnapped them, and when I asked for them back, he pretended to not know what was going on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao\u2019s eyes widened with surprise. He had heard of Big Fatty Zhang and Xu Baocai, and what Bai Xiaochun had said was true; neither of them had been seen or heard from in quite a while. To hear Bai Xiaochun accuse his Master of snatching them actually caused Zhao Tianjiao to hesitate for a moment, and then look over at Chen Hetian.</p><br/><p>Chen Hetian\u2019s eyes were as wide as Zhao Tianjiao's as he stared blankly at Bai Xiaochun. He really had no idea what was happening, and in fact, had never even heard of Big Fatty Zhang and Xu Baocai.</p><br/><p>Struggling to contain his wrath, he grated, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything to those two. I don\u2019t even know who they are! You have the wrong person, Bai Xiaochun!\u201d The truth was that he really didn\u2019t want to have Bai Xiaochun pissed off at him, so therefore, he added, \u201cThat\u2019s not how I do things!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell if you didn\u2019t do it, then who did!?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, his eyes narrowing angrily. Looking back at Zhao Tianjiao, he said, \u201cI won\u2019t let this drop, Eldest Brother. Big Fatty Zhang and Xu Baocai are good friends of mine, and right now, I don't even know if they\u2019re still alive. If this is really my fault, then I\u2019ll apologize later!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he dashed past Zhao Tianjiao toward Chen Hetian.</p><br/><p>Moments later, booms rang out as the two of them began fighting again.</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao smiled bitterly as he looked at Bai Xiaochun and then Chen Hetian. Finally, he sighed. Obviously, he wasn\u2019t in a position to try to separate them, and furthermore, he actually suspected that his Master could be lying\u2026.</p><br/><p>Chen Hetian felt like he was going crazy.</p><br/><p>\u201cI told you I didn\u2019t do it, Bai Xiaochun! Why are you acting like this!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not willing to be out-shouted by Chen Hetian, Bai Xiaochun raised his voice even more as he shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re the only person in the sect who I have a grudge with. If it wasn\u2019t you, then who was it? Drop the act, Chen Hetian! If you don\u2019t hand over Big Fatty Zhang and Xu Baocai right now, then I\u2019ll escalate this to the demigod patriarch!\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Hetian felt like blood was about to spray out of his mouth. Never before had he experienced this level of humiliation, and yet, he knew that he couldn\u2019t explain himself in a few short words. With that, his hand blurred as, instead of unleashing a divine ability, he pulled out a transmission jade slip to contact Bai Zhentian and Li Xiandao.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich of you two did it!?!?\u201d he transmitted. \u201cDammit, you\u2019re completely throwing me under the bus!! The two of you had better explain yourselves!!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun realized that Chen Hetian was sending some messages, he stopped in place and blinked a few times, anticipation rising in his heart.</p><br/><p>Earlier, both Bai Zhentian and Li Xiandao had been paying attention, and realized what was going on. Bai Zhentian didn't seem very fazed, but as for Li Xiandao, his face fell when he realized the truth.</p><br/><p>Before he could do anything though, Chen Hetian\u2019s message came in.</p><br/><p>Li Xiandao immediately began to wail in his heart. Although he was inclined to deny that he was involved, he could see how crazy Chen Hetian was going, and knew that lying now would only make things worse. So he sent a message back.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Chen\u2026 it\u2019s just a misunderstanding. Really\u2026 I asked around just now, and apparently one of the elders in my clan\u2026 accidentally kidnapped Big Fatty Zhang and Xu Baocai.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the message came in, Chen Hetian whipped his head around to look at Bai Xiaochun. Eyes crimson, he threw the jade slip out and cried, \u201cSee that! Well, do you?! Your two friends weren\u2019t taken by me! I didn\u2019t do it!! I didn\u2019t!!! It was Li Xiandao! You got the wrong person, Bai Xiaochun!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun caught the jade slip and looked at it, and immediately, anger began to burn in his heart. However, he kept that from showing on his face. Sticking his chin up, he snorted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWell, you can't blame me. Nobody forced you to go around looking like a villain all the time. Ah, whatever. Next time I have any problems like this, I\u2019ll just come to you for help. Alright, see you later.\u201d With that, he turned and blurred into motion toward Li Xiandao\u2019s residence.</p><br/><p>If Chen Hetian hadn\u2019t put the pieces of the puzzle together by this point, then he didn\u2019t deserve to have lived for so many years.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeaven-damned Bai Xiaochun! Does he mean he\u2019s going to come cause problems for me whenever he has the slightest inconvenience?! He's going to force me to help him whether I'm actually involved or not?!?!\u201d Chen Hetian\u2019s mood sank further. Were it not for the fact that he was a deva, he would already have been coughing up blood.</p><br/><p>Off to the side, Zhao Tianjiao looked on, shaking his head and smiling wryly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Bai Xiaochun is a complete scoundrel!!\u201d Chen Hetian grumbled angrily. The mere thought of Bai Xiaochun coming to cause problems again in the future caused his vision to go dim. If he had known things would end up like this, he would never have done anything to offend him\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

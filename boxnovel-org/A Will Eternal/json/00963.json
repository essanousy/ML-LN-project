Aaaiiiieee!</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>The Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect had two ice statues, one holding up the pure white Cloud Order, the other holding up the pitch black Lightning Order!</p><br/><p>At the moment, a piercing shriek was echoing out deep within the black cloud that housed the Lightning Order. Of course, it was Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate the north!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a shriek filled with bitterness and defiance. However, no matter how loudly he screamed, his voice did not go beyond\u2026 Lightning Penitentiary, where he had been imprisoned for three days already.</p><br/><p>He was already wracked with despair. Within the depths of the black cloud, he was surrounded by layer upon layer of restrictive sealing spells, creating a cell that was only about 30 meters of space in which he could move around.</p><br/><p>Beyond the borders of the cell were innumerable lightning bolts, each one as thick as an arm and abounding with so much destructive power that it caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face to go pale.</p><br/><p>\u201cComplete and utter bullying!!\u201d he muttered, shivering as he sat there, looking out at the darkness and the lightning. Calling out to the heavens and cursing the hells brought not even the slightest response. As far as Bai Xiaochun was concerned, this was the unluckiest he had ever been in his entire life.</p><br/><p>\u201cCompletely ridiculous. Three-point covenant, four-point covenant, five-point covenant\u2026. All of that I could deal with. But I can\u2019t believe they actually locked me up!\u201d He felt like he was about to go crazy, and couldn\u2019t come up with any effective methods to do anything about the situation.</p><br/><p>Not only could he not escape, every few hours, lightning would gather around his cell and then strike him repeatedly.</p><br/><p>There was only one way to deal with the shocking lightning, and that was to draw upon his cultivation base power. Unfortunately, Lightning Penitentiary was cut off from the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, which led Bai Xiaochun to the conclusion that, eventually, he would run out of power to stave off the lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do?\u201d he sighed. Right now, his main hope was that Du Lingfei would finish her mission soon and come to free him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm gonna remember this, you northerners!\u201d he said loudly. \u201cYou just wait. After I become a demigod, I'm going to get my revenge!\u201d With that, he let out a roar of frustration.</p><br/><p>However, as soon as he did, a sarcastic chuckle could be heard from off to the side.</p><br/><p>\u201cBecome a demigod? Even then you won\u2019t be able to get revenge.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, looking around. His divine sense had been restricted as soon as he was thrown into his cell, but his ordinary senses had not. However, during the past three days, he hadn\u2019t detected any signs of life anywhere nearby.</p><br/><p>As he looked around vigilantly, he saw the clouds off to the side seething, and then gradually turning translucent, revealing another cell roughly 300 meters away.</p><br/><p>It was also thirty meters across, formed by countless restrictive spells. Just like his own cell, it was surrounded by dancing lightning, which occasionally shot into the cell to strike at an emaciated figure who sat there cross-legged!</p><br/><p>It was an old man wearing threadbare garments. He was little more than skin and bones, and his aura was very weak. Whenever the lightning struck him, he would shiver slightly, and yet, his expression never changed. Apparently, while he couldn\u2019t stop the physical torment of the lightning bolts, his mind had long since grown used to the pain.</p><br/><p>His hand was currently settling back down onto his knee; apparently, not even the restrictive spells could completely hold his will in check, allowing him the basic ability to control the clouds around him.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun looked into the old man\u2019s eyes, it felt like his eyes were being stabbed, eliciting a gasp.</p><br/><p>\u201cListen, kid, I'm a demigod, and even I'm stuck here. So my advice is that you adjust that little oath of yours. Maybe you can aim for becoming a celestial?\u201d The man grinned, and as his yellowish teeth were illuminated by the lightning, he looked particularly sinister. Bai Xiaochun shivered.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve been in here for years now,\u201d the man continued, \u201cand I can tell you that people who get locked up here don\u2019t tend to last for long. Now that I think about it, it's been a while since anybody new came around.</p><br/><p>\u201cCome come, kid. Can you dance? Do a sexy little dance for me, and if I like it, I might just give you a secret magic that can help you deal with the pain.\u201d The old man eyed Bai Xiaochun up and down, eyes shining with a bizarre light as he chuckled.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had been startled by the man\u2019s sudden appearance, but had now recovered. And he could sense that he and this man were similar in that, after having been locked up, they both got a bit braver.</p><br/><p>Glaring at the man, he said, \u201cShut up, old man. I worked as a prison guard in the past, and eventually I lost track of how many prisoners like you I mopped the floor with.\u201d Snorting coldly, he stuck his chin up and looked away.</p><br/><p>The old man laughed heartily. \u201cThe stubborn type, huh? I really like young bucks like you. You know, 3,000 years ago there was another stubborn punk who got locked up here. He only lasted a month before he was twisting and turning in front of me, begging for my secret magic. Whenever you\u2019re ready, I\u2019ll be waiting for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Apparently, he was very pleased at the additional amusement that Bai Xiaochun had brought into his life</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was already feeling quite annoyed at this man\u2019s gaze and laughter. After giving him another good glare, he ignored him. After all, he just needed to wait for Du Lingfei to finish her mission, and then she would come back and think of a way to get him out.</p><br/><p>Two hours later, the lightning around his cell began to build up more and more, creating something like a lightning storm around him.</p><br/><p>When the lightning storm struck, he drew upon his cultivation base to defend himself. The sight of all that lightning was really shocking. After all, the destructive power in only one bolt wasn\u2019t anything to really worry about, but from what he could tell, there were hundreds of thousands of them.</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one to have to deal with the lightning in that moment. The old man was also struck. However, the man\u2019s expression didn\u2019t so much as flicker because of it. Instead, he looked over at Bai Xiaochun with ill intentions flickering in his eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou still have spiritual power now, so you can defend yourself. But in another ten days or so, you\u2019ll run out\u2026. And that\u2019s when you\u2019ll really start to \u2018enjoy\u2019 yourself.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe power of the lightning builds up over time, you know. Eventually, it reaches the point of being the most horrific suffering in heaven and earth.\u201d Although the old man trembled physically as he spoke, it didn't affect his voice at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know what I love to hear the most? The screams of people getting struck by lightning. I just close my eyes and revel in the beauty of it\u2026.\u201d Licking his lips, he gazed at Bai Xiaochun, his eyes brimming with malice.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was in no mood to pay any attention to the man. The lightning continued to strike him for a full hour before finally fading away. In the process, a large portion of his spiritual power was drained away.</p><br/><p>He now only had seventy percent left, a fact that caused an unsightly expression to appear on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t going to work\u2026.\u201d he thought, looking around apprehensively at all the lightning. After some calculations, he came to the conclusion that his spiritual power really would be drained in about ten days.</p><br/><p>Although he was confident in his fleshly body power, the fact that this old man, a demigod, was in such tattered shape, left him worried that he wouldn\u2019t be able to match up.</p><br/><p>Five more days flew by. Whenever the lightning struck, his spiritual power levels got lower and lower, and the cackles of the old man grew louder.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was feeling very frustrated. On the sixth day, however, he suddenly looked up, his eyes bloodshot as he stared at the surrounding lightning bolts.</p><br/><p>He had considered many options, but none had seemed viable. That meant he only had one choice left\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack on the Heavenspan Sea, when Eldest Brother was going through his tribulation, I actually consumed the tribulation cloud. That cloud had lightning in it\u2026 and in addition to the destructive power it contained, it also had life force!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m pretty sure my apprentice was helping me back then, so it\u2019s hard to say\u2026 if I can do the same thing in here.\u201d After vacillating for some time, he saw the lightning building up into a storm, and he gritted his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cMight as well give it a shot!\u201d He rose to his feet, drawing upon his cultivation base, although not in a way to defend himself.</p><br/><p>Hundreds of thousands of lightning bolts swirled into a massive storm than then pierced into his cell and appeared right in front of him. Just as it was about to smash into him, he roared, opened his mouth, and sucked in a breath!</p><br/><p>The old man was initially stunned, but then began to laugh in mocking fashion.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnother fool who thinks he can consume the lightning. Looking to die, huh? Years ago, I called myself the Lightning Ancestor, and was the only rogue cultivator demigod in the north. But not even I dared to try to consume lightning bolts. Over all the years that I\u2019ve been here, I've seen a lot of-- uh\u2026 what?\u201d All of a sudden, the old man\u2019s eyes bulged so wide that they nearly dropped out of his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cFreaking\u2026 w-w-what\u2026 what are you doing?!?!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

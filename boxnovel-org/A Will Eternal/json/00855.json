At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but compare Mistress Red-Dust with the female savages of this matriarchal tribe.</p><br/><p>When he did that\u2026 he suddenly felt blessed.</p><br/><p>Of course, he didn\u2019t show that on his face. Instead, his compassion grew more obvious. And thus, he took Song Que and Master God-Diviner, and left the tribe.</p><br/><p>By means of medicinal pills, Bai Xiaochun helped Master God-Diviner remove the restrictive spell that had been placed on him, and helped him recover from his injured and weakened state. Gradually, the color returned to his face, and more importantly, excitement filled his heart because of his escape from calamity.</p><br/><p>It was as if new life had been breathed into him. He was in a wonderful mood, to the point where the sky even seemed bluer than normal, and the sunshine brighter. Everything was going well. However\u2026 that good mood only lasted for a few hours\u2026. After the group of three was a short distance away from the matriarchal tribe, Bai Xiaochun began to talk.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster God-Diviner, you really ended up in a rough situation! Ai. Before running into you, I thought that Que\u2019er had it worst. Who would have thought that you\u2026?\u201d As he sighed, Song Que snorted coldly in his heart, convinced that Bai Xiaochun was preparing to show off to Master God-Diviner.</p><br/><p>And that was exactly right. However, even after the hours which had passed, it was to Bai Xiaochun\u2019s irritation that Master God-Diviner didn\u2019t ask any questions about how he had fared in the Wildlands. His heart itched with the sensation of having his exploits unlauded, and he was starting to get jumpy in the hopes that Master God-Diviner would make some inquiries.</p><br/><p>A strange expression appeared on Master God-Diviner\u2019s face. It had been many years since he had been around Bai Xiaochun, but he knew him well. Furthermore, although he hadn\u2019t looked closely at the cultivation bases of Bai Xiaochun and Song Que earlier, when he did now, he was shocked at their progress. Then he thought about all of the events which had played out back in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect and the Great Wall, and at that point, he decided to change the subject.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, don\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019ll recover fine after I do a bit of cultivation.\u201d With that, he laughed heartily and rotated his cultivation base a bit.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was less than pleased at Master God-Diviner\u2019s complete lack of loyalty. All Bai Xiaochun wanted was to show off a bit, and yet the man wasn\u2019t cooperating at all. That made him suddenly think about Xu Baocai. Xu Baocai would definitely have cooperated!</p><br/><p>Song Que, on the other hand, was very pleased with how Bai Xiaochun was reacting. Time passed, and the three of them got closer and closer to the Deadmire.</p><br/><p>Eventually, when they were only a day away, Master God-Diviner, who still had not given Bai Xiaochun any chances to revel in glory, finally couldn\u2019t hold back from asking a certain question.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm\u2026 where exactly are we going?\u201d</p><br/><p>The question caused Song Que\u2019s heart to thump, and he was just about to jump in to provide the answer when Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes lit up. Leaping to his feet, he loudly said, \u201cWe're going to the Deadmire! That's the way back to the River-Defying Sect. Have you heard of the Deadmire? It's super dangerous! Devas won\u2019t even step inside a single pace, let alone Nascent Soul experts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Deadmire?\u201d Master God-Diviner said, his eyes widening. He had indeed heard of the Deadmire, and knew that what Bai Xiaochun had said was no exaggeration. According to what he had heard, not even demigods would dare to set foot inside!</p><br/><p>It was a forbidden region where life did not exist!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t we just go to the Great Wall\u2026?\u201d Master God-Diviner asked, swallowing hard. Although he had divined that he would be saved, he hadn\u2019t come up with any information regarding what would happen afterward. After escaping the greatest calamity of his entire life, he couldn\u2019t help but worry about his fate.</p><br/><p>Off to the side, Song Que sighed. He knew\u2026 that nobody would be able to stop Bai Xiaochun from showing off now. And he was right. As soon as the second question left Master God-Diviner\u2019s mouth, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes began to shine even more brightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! So you <em>have</em> heard of it! Alright, Master God-Diviner, listen up while I explain!\u201d Feeling very pleased with himself, he slapped his bag of holding to produce a command medallion.</p><br/><p>At this point, Master God-Diviner\u2019s eyes went a bit blank as he realized that he had given Bai Xiaochun the opportunity he had been looking for\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee this? With this command medallion, we can get through the Deadmire easily and safely!\u201d Bai Xiaochun waved the command medallion in front of Master God-Diviner\u2019s face, his eyebrows jumping up and down with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know what you\u2019re wondering. What kind of command medallion is this? And how did I get it? Well, it\u2019s a long story, but we have plenty of time. I\u2019ll explain everything in detail. It all started back when we were teleported here into the Wildlands\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun spent most of the following day recounting his adventures in great detail, putting special emphasis on the status and position he had attained.</p><br/><p>At first, Master God-Diviner sighed in regret. However, by the time it got to the part where Bai Xiaochun kidnapped the demigod Giant Ghost King, his eyes nearly popped out of his skull. And eventually, he came to realize that the Giant Ghost King kidnapping was like nothing compared to the rest of the story!</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you just say\u2026 that you kidnapped all of the chosen in the Wildlands?!?! And the Giant Ghost King gave you Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s hand in marriage!?</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026 you actually became the inspections commissioner of the Arch-Emperor Dynasty? And performed countless shakedowns?!?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou helped the Grand Heavenmaster enact a Proclamation of Universal Grace? You\u2019re an earthly necromancer?!?!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2026. Heavens! You\u2019re not kidding about this, are you? Your apprentice is the Hell-Emperor?!?!?!\u201d Master God-Diviner was thoroughly shaken, and could hardly believe what he was hearing. The story was so unbelievable it was almost like a fairy tale.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was very pleased with the look in Master God-Diviner\u2019s eyes. At this point, he finally felt he could leave the Wildlands without any regret in his heart.</p><br/><p>However, he also decided it would be better to err on the side of modesty.</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, I did okay. Actually, I wasn\u2019t even trying very hard.\u201d Swishing his sleeve, he stuck his chin up and said, \u201cYou know I can reduce most things to ashes with the swish of a sleeve. It\u2019s not the first time.\u201d</p><br/><p>To Master God-Diviner, it felt like thunder crashing in his ears, and the truth was, he didn\u2019t really believe it. But\u2026 then he noticed the unsightly expression on Song Que\u2019s face, and how he wasn\u2019t saying anything at all. At that point, Master God-Diviner\u2019s heart was struck by great waves of shock. That was especially true considering the final part of the story regarding Bai Xiaochun\u2019s apprentice being the Hell-Emperor.</p><br/><p>It was to Master God-Diviner's grief and shock that he realized the cruel truth: Bai Xiaochun really did rock all creation wherever he went!</p><br/><p>In the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, he formed a powerful underworld organization!</p><br/><p>At the Great Wall, he fought his way to the coveted rank of major general!</p><br/><p>And in the Wildlands, he shockingly ended up as the Master of the Hell-Emperor!</p><br/><p>Master God-Diviner almost couldn\u2019t wrap his mind around it all. Even just one of the things Bai Xiaochun had done would be enough to shake anyone to the core, let alone all of them together.</p><br/><p>It was roughly evening when the group of three, including the dazed Master God-Diviner, arrived at the location where the Heavenspan River region\u2019s northern and eastern Great Walls had once met. This was the entrance to\u2026 a land devoid of life!</p><br/><p>It was actually a towering and winding mountain range that, upon being entered\u2026 led to a location no one had ever been to. The Deadmire!</p><br/><p>As soon as they caught sight of the mountains, Bai Xiaochun patted his bag of holding, confident that the gravekeeper had been telling the truth. Gritting his teeth, he flew into the mountains!</p><br/><p>Song Que took a deep breath. He didn\u2019t particularly feel like going into the Deadmire, but knew he had no choice. The Great Wall had collapsed, and the Celestial had sealed the area, making passage back to the Heavenspan region that way impossible.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t go through the Deadmire, it would be impossible to say how long they would have to wait to get home. Eyes flickering with determination, Song Que followed Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Master God-Diviner shook off his daze, and as he did, his eyes were filled with awe and veneration. To him, Bai Xiaochun actually seemed like a god. As of this moment, he was far more confident in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s ability to traverse the Deadmire than Song Que was, and therefore, it was without hesitation that he followed along!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

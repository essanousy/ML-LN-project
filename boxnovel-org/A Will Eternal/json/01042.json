But these were the Eternal Immortal Domains, and therefore, the mighty energy fluctuations did little to the surrounding landscape, much less the roiling Eternal Sea.</p><br/><p>Compared to the huge lizard, Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King were like tiny bugs.</p><br/><p>As the intense energy of the lizard got closer and closer, the Giant Ghost King\u2019s heart began to race as he sensed his cultivation base beginning to grow unstable.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of ship is that?!?!\u201d he said, his scalp tingling in shock. At that point, Bai Xiaochun waved his hand, causing a moon-shaped flash of light to emerge from his bag of holding. It was his moonflower, the same one which had appeared during his fight with Daoist Heavenspan.</p><br/><p>After spending the better part of the past year in recovery, the moonflower was mostly back to normal. Furthermore, the aura of its home, and the familiar spiritual energy of heaven and earth here, ensured that it was bursting with excitement. Directed by Bai Xiaochun, the moonflower shot toward the Giant Ghost King and coiled protectively around him, defending him against the pressure from the bone galleon to some degree.</p><br/><p>When the Giant Ghost King saw the moonflower, his eyes went wide, especially considering that it emanated fluctuations equivalent to the great circle of the Demigod Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is that\u2026? Fudge, the great circle of the Demigod Realm?! It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s stronger than me!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The added boost from the moonflower helped the Giant Ghost King speed up, and together with Bai Xiaochun, he flew deeper into the Eternal Sea.</p><br/><p>As the two of them sped along, black flames suddenly rose up in the eyes of the bone lizard that made it seem intelligent to a certain degree. At the same time, Ghostmother performed an incantation gesture, causing the lizard\u2019s mouth to open and emit a howl in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Along with the howl came black flames that also bore down on Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>It was a raging sea of fire, its heat so intense that it seemed it could melt anything that got in its way!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression flickered at the terrifying power he sensed in the sea of flames. Without any hesitation, he spun, clenched his hand into a fist, and unleashed a punch!</p><br/><p>The power of his fleshly body erupted, and numerous shockwaves rolled out as his fist made contact with the sea of flames.</p><br/><p>A deafening boom filled the air as the sea of flames suddenly lurched to a halt as surely as if it were a person who had been grabbed by the throat!</p><br/><p>Ghostmother snorted coldly, sending another command to the bone lizard. Another howl erupted from its mouth, accompanied by a second sea of flames. However, this one was vastly more powerful than the last, and it immediately destroyed the tempest that had been created by Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fist strike. Then, it coalesced into the shape of an enormous, fiery ghost face, which lunged forward ravenously.</p><br/><p>It was at this point that the seven demigod cultivators closed in like seven shooting stars. In the blink of an eye, they were right on top of Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King.</p><br/><p>Three of them performed incantation gestures to summon huge, flaming birds that let out ear-piercing shrieks. The birds merged with the demigods, giving them additional speed that they used to attack the Giant Ghost King.</p><br/><p>An unsightly expression could be seen on the Giant Ghost King\u2019s face as he fell back and waved his hand, sending a mist of ghosts out to defend himself. At the same time, the moonflower held nothing back to aid him.</p><br/><p>Already, a major battle was underway right over the Eternal Sea!</p><br/><p>As the fiery ghost face closed in, Bai Xiaochun used the power of the Live Forever Codex to fuel his Cloud Lightning Forefather Transformation. Roaring, he transformed to a height of more than 300 meters. Looking like the forefather of all humanity, the original Arch-Ancestor, he leaped forward, throwing his arms out wide as he slammed into the ghost face.</p><br/><p>The ghost face howled in response, and yet, was powerless to defend itself, and shattered into innumerable black sparks that fell down to the Eternal Sea below.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo wonder the gravekeeper picked him,\u201d Ghostmother thought, looking down coldly at Bai Xiaochun. \u201cAnd he was able to defeat Daoist Heavenspan too. He must have plenty of trump cards at his disposal!\u201d Instead of impulsively rushing into the fighting herself, she waited on the deck of the bone galleon.</p><br/><p>During the months in which she had been hunting down Heavenspan cultivators, she had collected quite a few clues that gave her a fairly good understanding of the final, spectacular battle between Bai Xiaochun and Daoist Heavenspan.</p><br/><p>She was still completely and utterly confident that, since she was in the early Celestial Realm, she was superior to Bai Xiaochun. And yet, she still maintained caution. Her bone lizard was the envy of the other celestials in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, and therefore, she relied on it to carry out the initial attack on Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Chuckling coldly, she performed another incantation gesture, causing yet another black sea of flames to erupt out. Within it was a nine-meter column of light that shot directly toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>And yet, things weren\u2019t over yet. Ghostmother now performed an incantation gesture with her left hand, causing a magical symbol to appear there. At that point, the two ghost flags on the deck of the battleship began to wave, and the ghost faces emerged, joining the sea of flames in the attack.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s expression was unsightly to the extreme. He had known all along that Ghostmother would not be easy to deal with. Her bone lizard and its seas of flame contained terrifying destructive power, and only three bursts of it had already filled the area with a deadly miasma.</p><br/><p>Although Bai Xiaochun had shocking powers of regeneration, the way the miasma constantly ate away at him caused him to frown.</p><br/><p>Then there was the beam of light, which he could instantly tell was too powerful for him to face directly.</p><br/><p>And last were the two ghost faces. Although they didn\u2019t match up to the laughing-crying ghost face, they still radiated the power of the quasi-celestial level, and were obviously very intelligent.</p><br/><p>\u201cGhostmother must already know about my fight with Daoist Heavenspan. That\u2019s why she's being so careful. She wants me to use my trump cards early on\u2026. However, I can\u2019t do that this close to the borders of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty\u2026.\u201d Gritting his teeth, he faced the beam of light, the sea of flames, and the ghost face, and clenched his hand into a fist. Instantly, a black vortex sprang up around it.</p><br/><p>Then, rumbling sounds echoed out as a shadowy emperor appeared, radiating domineering energy left and right!</p><br/><p>\u201cI've never fought a true celestial before. Let\u2019s see how far away I actually am from the Mahayana Realm!\u201d His eyes were completely bloodshot as wild energy fluctuations erupted from his fist!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

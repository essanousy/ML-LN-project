Their faces were as ashen as death, including one young woman who was the very same person Bai Xiaochun had encountered on his first day in the clan. Her expression was a mask of despairing terror.</p><br/><p>Everyone in the entire clan was now looking at the stone gate!</p><br/><p>As the entrance to the ancestral land opened, the clan chief bellowed and entered. At the same time, Bai Xiaochun shot toward the same location, taking the twelve-colored sea of fire with him.</p><br/><p>The heat from the flame caused the clan chief\u2019s face to flicker; he could sense how threatening it was, and yet, nothing could suppress the madness in his heart.</p><br/><p>He had just watched his beloved son be cut down, and had simultaneously witnessed someone he viewed as trash, Bai Hao, rise to prominence. Bai Hao had trampled upon everything that was dear and important to the clan chief, and therefore... it was literally impossible to describe how enraged and insane he was. He wanted to kill someone, that person being Bai Hao, and as such, he drew upon the full, explosive power of his cultivation base, using the battle prowess of the mid Nascent Soul stage to become something like a sharp sword that stabbed toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie, you unfilial bastard!!\u201d The clan chief stabbed directly into the twelve-colored flame. However, before he could get very far, Bai Xiaochun waved his hand, causing the devastating power of the flame to push the clan chief to one side.</p><br/><p>As the intense rumbling sounds echoed out, Bai Xiaochun took a deep breath and ignored the clan chief. Instead, he accelerated, causing everything around him to slow down.</p><br/><p>He was moving with speed that was impossible to describe. The clan chief had been shoved out of his way, and now, Bai Xiaochun blurred past him, instantly appearing... at the stone gate, where he emerged out into the Bai Clan!</p><br/><p>The moment he was out in the open, the twelve-colored flame roiled out in all directions, causing the sky to turn bright red, and filling the area with pressure and energy that left the members of the Bai Clan gasping.</p><br/><p>Never before had they seen anything this unbelievable. Not only was the flame itself shocking, but the fact that Bai Xiaochun was right there in the middle of it was even more astonishing. He looked like the overlord of all fire!</p><br/><p>All eyes were on Bai Xiaochun as he appeared out in the middle of the clan. As he did, the seven or eight clan elders who were from the direct bloodline all glared at him with killing intent, and then began to move in his direction.</p><br/><p>Of course, they feared the twelve-colored sea of fire, so at the moment, their only goal was to surround and capture him.</p><br/><p>And yet, it didn\u2019t matter how quickly they moved, they couldn\u2019t match the speed of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s left hand, within which suddenly appeared eight jade slips. He instantly crushed the first of those jade slips, which caused the hundreds of murdersoul spikes he had planted throughout the clan to simultaneously detonate in dramatic fashion.</p><br/><p>Explosions rocked hundreds of locations in the clan, causing the defensive spell formation, the strongest spell formation in the entire clan, to ripple and distort. Then, cracks began to spread out across its surface.</p><br/><p>The grand spell formation... was about to shatter!!</p><br/><p>Next, Bai Xiaochun crushed the rest of the jade slips, which instantly caused the power of teleportation to rise up around him. Shockingly, those jade slips were all teleportation talismans!</p><br/><p>All of this happened in the time it takes a spark to fly off of a piece of flint; the grand spell formation began to fall apart, and the power of teleportation filled the area. However, even as Bai Xiaochun began to fade away, the clan elders chuckled coldly and sent their Nascent Soul divine sense out, locking the air down and nullifying the power of the teleportation talismans!</p><br/><p>Nullifying teleportations was actually a common tactic, and considering that these were all Nascent Soul experts, it wasn\u2019t at all difficult for them to cause spatial chaos.</p><br/><p>As soon as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s teleportation power was interfered with, his eyes widened, and his heart began to pound. However, he had planned for something like this. Without the slightest hesitation, he threw his head back and roared. Even as the Nascent Soul clan elders charged from one direction, and the clan chief charged toward him from within the ancestral land, he took a step forward.</p><br/><p>With that step, he used the secret magic of the Undying Hex, causing his body to blur, ignoring the spatial chaos caused by the Nascent Soul cultivators.</p><br/><p>The faces of the direct bloodline elders and the clan chief all fell dramatically. The type of spatial distortion being used by Bai Xiaochun was something they couldn\u2019t do anything about, especially considering that he was currently surrounded by a twelve-colored sea of fire that made him completely unapproachable.</p><br/><p>However, just in the moment when it seemed Bai Xiaochun would teleport away, a cold snort echoed out from the catacombs beneath the clan. It was none other than the deva patriarch surrounded by the seven candles! His eyes were currently glowing brightly as he made a grasping gesture, causing the air outside in the clan to distort as a powerful will appeared. It was a will that surpassed the will of the heavens, and took the form of a huge hand that began to close around Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere!\u201d</p><br/><p>The hand locked everything around Bai Xiaochun down, and although it didn't completely interrupt his Undying Hex secret magic, it did slow it down significantly.</p><br/><p>Instantly, the faces of the direct bloodline clan elders and the clan chief went wild with joy.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe patriarch is making a move!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to die beyond the shadow of a doubt, Bai Hao!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face fell, and yet, he had also been prepared for something like this to happen. Eyes shining with cold light, he shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re exactly who I've been waiting for!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Even as the words left his mouth, he moved his hand, closing his fingers into a fist that forced the sea of fire to converge on his palm and take the shape of a twelve-colored flame.</p><br/><p>As the sea of fire began to shine with dazzling light, it destabilized, and then suddenly erupted with an intense roaring sound.</p><br/><p>Sensations of deadly crisis erupted within the direct bloodline clan elders and the clan chief. Before any of them could react, the sea of fire collapsed, causing deafening rumbling sounds to echo out!</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUMBLE!</p><br/><p>Twelve-colored flame roiled out for hundreds of meters in all directions, enveloping everything in its path. The clan elders and the clan chief backed up with utmost urgency, but the hand of the deva patriarch didn\u2019t, and within the blink of an eye, made contact with the flame.</p><br/><p>The resulting boom rose into the highest heavens!</p><br/><p>The air in the area collapsed, and the sea of fire vanished. The deva patriarch\u2019s illusory hand survived, but was clearly in bad shape as it continued to close in around Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>However, Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t afraid of a weakened deva-level divine ability. Suddenly, three ghost images appeared as his three clones stepped out and shot toward the hand.</p><br/><p>Howling, they used all the power at their disposal to fight back!</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>As soon as his wood clone touched the hand, blood sprayed out of his mouth, and he transformed into a beam of green light that shot back into Bai Xiaochun. However, the hand had been slowed, and was even dimmer than before.</p><br/><p>BOOM!!</p><br/><p>His water clone was next. He slammed into the hand, resulting in most of his body being destroyed. And yet, the hand stopped for a moment, and grew even dimmer!</p><br/><p>Lastly was his fire clone. Instead of simply defending, he took the initiative to attack with all his power.</p><br/><p>BOOM!!!</p><br/><p>Blood sprayed out of the fire clone\u2019s mouth as he fell back. However, the huge hand had been damaged three times in a row, and was now little more than an outline. By the time it hit Bai Xiaochun\u2019s true self, all that happened was that he coughed up a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>After wiping the blood off of his lips, he threw his head back and laughed uproariously.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you can do, deva?!?!\u201d As his words rang out... he began to fade away. Clearly, he was only moments away from piercing through the air and vanishing!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Junior Patriarch, I'm leaving too. If we all stick around here, we\u2019ll never solve the problem of being hungry. Look, why don\u2019t you--\u201d</p><br/><p>At the sudden realization that everyone was apparently planning to go their own way, Bai Xiaochun shot to his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go, guys! You\u2019re my Dao protectors! I brought you here with me! What am I supposed to do if you all leave...?\u201d What was especially terrifying was the realization that the spirit stones the sect had given him were almost all gone. The fact that everyone was leaving at that point was what hurt the most.</p><br/><p>\u201cI brought you here with me! You\u2019re supposed to take care of me....\u201d Despite his protestations, Song Que simply snorted coldly, then turned and left. His plan was to go on some missions to earn the resources he needed to take care of himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cQue\u2019er....\u201d Bai Xiaochun called after him. However, Song Que didn\u2019t even look over his shoulder. As for Master God-Diviner, he was getting ready to leave too, but Bai Xiaochun reached out and grabbed his arm.</p><br/><p>\u201cMaster God-Diviner,\u201d he said piteously, \u201cI won\u2019t call you Master Snortsnort anymore, okay? Don\u2019t go....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Patriarch, I don\u2019t have any other choice. Before coming here, none of us had any idea that merely staying alive in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect would be so difficult. I think I\u2019ll go start performing some divinations to get some food to eat....\u201d Although his words were chosen well, inside, he was furious, and at the same time, couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how much he missed the River-Defying Sect. Shaking himself out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s grip, he left the spirit abode and was gone in a flash.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you people!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said angrily. As far as he was concerned, Song Que and Master God-Diviner were being completely unreasonable. If they had gone out on their own earlier, it might have been tolerable, but instead, they waited until he ran out of spirit stones to abandon him.</p><br/><p>Even as Bai Xiaochun stood there fuming, Chen Manyao sighed and stood up. Looking over at Bai Xiaochun, she said, \u201cThis is my fault for not getting complete information. Junior Patriarch, I'm going to go look for some friends of mine. If destiny will have it, we\u2019ll meet again in the rainbow district.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without giving Bai Xiaochun a chance to respond, she flew out of the spirit abode.</p><br/><p>Chen Manyao\u2019s sudden departure pushed Bai Xiaochun toward the brink of madness. After all, she had come to him to ask to join the party, and now here she was just throwing him to the wayside. Thankfully, he could console himself with the fact that Xu Baocai and Big Fatty Zhang were staying behind.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Fine, if they want to go, let them go. At least Eldest Brother and Little Treasure have some loyalty!\u201d Looking over at them, he slapped his chest and said, \u201cLook you two, don't worry, I\u2019ll--\u201d</p><br/><p>However, that was when Xu Baocai rose awkwardly to his feet. \u201cJunior Patriarch, I--\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey what are you doing? Sit back down!\u201d Heart pounding, Bai Xiaochun was just getting ready to physically block Xu Baocai\u2019s path, when he noticed the look of determination in his eyes, as well as the tears.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Patriarch,\u201d he pled, \u201clet me go, please. I... I don't want to die of starvation! Look at me! I'm the weakest of all of us, and I'm already skin and bones! If things keep going like this, I\u2019m going to be the first one to die!</p><br/><p>\u201cShow me mercy, I beg of you! Let me go!</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease, Junior Patriarch....\u201d He even started tugging at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s sleeve.</p><br/><p>The anger faded from Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face, and he sighed. \u201cAlright, everyone has the right to pick their own path. Leave if you want!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMany thanks, Junior Patriarch!!\u201d Eyes filled with gratitude, Xu Baocai fled the spirit abode.</p><br/><p>As soon as he was outside, he caught sight of Master God-Diviner off in the distance. The two of them exchanged a glance, then joined together and headed off into the city, chuckling.</p><br/><p>Looking quite proud of himself, Master God-Diviner produced a chunk of spirit meat from his bag of holding and started munching on it as he said, \u201cSong Que has pretty high ambitions and isn\u2019t very flexible. I bet he really did think that he was in a bad position. We\u2019re different though. Finally, we're free from the clutches of evil!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Baocai hesitated for a moment, then produced a similar chunk of spirit meat. After taking a bite, he said, \u201cAre you sure this is a good idea though? After all, we\u2019re still technically Dao protectors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Clearly, the two of them had quite a collection of resources built up. After all, for the past several days, all of the food they\u2019d been eating had been provided by Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Master God-Diviner hesitated for a moment. After a bit of thought, he said, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do about that. If we had stayed back there, we would still have gone hungry eventually anyway, what with the junior patriarch\u2019s way of handling things. Don\u2019t worry, let\u2019s take care of ourselves first, and then we can meet back up with him when we get to the rainbow district.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a bit more chatting regarding their plans, the two of them headed off into the city to find their own place to stay.</p><br/><p>As of this point, the only people left in the spirit abode were Bai Xiaochun and Big Fatty Zhang. Big Fatty Zhang looked at Bai Xiaochun standing there in anger, then sighed and closed his eyes to meditate.</p><br/><p>Despite Bai Xiaochun\u2019s rage, there was nothing he could do about the situation. At least he had Big Fatty Zhang there to accompany him. However, the next day, not even Big Fatty Zhang could take it any longer. When evening fell, he walked over to Bai Xiaochun and said, \u201cNinth Fatty....\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun instantly started to get nervous. \u201cEldest Brother, are you--\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNinth Fatty, it\u2019s not that your Eldest Brother doesn\u2019t care about you. If things keep going like this, I\u2019m gonna die. I\u2019ll go out to perform some spirit enhancements. Don\u2019t worry, Ninth Fatty, after I get some money built up, I\u2019ll come back and take care of you!\u201d Big Fatty Zhang had clearly made his mind up, and Bai Xiaochun didn't say anything to try to change his mind.</p><br/><p>Big Fatty Zhang clapped Bai Xiaochun on the shoulder, then took a deep breath, his eyes gleaming as if he had accepted a holy mission. With that, he walked out of the spirit abode....</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was the only person left. As the sun slowly sank down over the horizon, he stood outside the door looking more lonesome than ever. Finally, he let out a long sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cGone. They've all gone....\u201d Crestfallen, he walked back into the spirit abode and sat down, his hunger growing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do? I'm so hungry!\u201d Considering that night was falling, he finally went out and used some of his dwindling spirit stone savings to buy some more spirit food. Then he looked around at all the red-robed disciples hurrying here and there on various missions.</p><br/><p>Although some of the missions were dangerous, considering that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation base was in the Gold Core level, they wouldn\u2019t pose any threat to him. However, the rewards for accomplishing such missions were small.</p><br/><p>Based on his calculations, doing missions to survive would require him to do them almost all day every day. That was mostly because the high level of his cultivation base meant that the drain on his body was even more noticeable.</p><br/><p>And of course, the missions with bigger rewards were the ones that were more dangerous.</p><br/><p>Despite putting some thought to it, he couldn\u2019t come up with any good ideas. Sighing, he went back to his spirit abode. Back inside, the little turtle finally woke up and stuck his head out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s bag of holding. He looked at Bai Xiaochun suspiciously, clearly wondering why he had been asleep so long. However, Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t in any mood to pay attention to him. Seeing how he was being ignored, the turtle\u2019s suspicions faded, and he disappeared back into the bag of holding.</p><br/><p>A few more days passed. Bai Xiaochun went out into the city a few times to try to get inspiration for what to do. He completely suppressed his cultivation base, ensuring that no fluctuations whatsoever emerged from him, which also reduced the drain on his body.</p><br/><p>However, no matter how many ideas he came up with, he found that there were already people in the city using those methods to earn merit points. Trying to compete with them would be pointless. He even tried to find some unique missions at the Missions Office suited to his style, but there were simply too many disciples there looking for missions.</p><br/><p>By this point, he knew exactly why all of the people he had seen in the city were always thin and in a hurry, and also had such strange cultivation bases. The pressure weighing down on them on a daily basis created something like an instinct. Because of the interference of the spiritual power, it was impossible to see who was powerful and who was weak.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that a majestic Gold Core cultivator like me is actually going to starve to death!!\u201d he lamented. He was getting to the point that he was so hungry he couldn\u2019t take it. His bag of holding was now completely devoid of spirit stones, and he was almost out of food. Soon, he would have nothing left to eat other than spirit plants.</p><br/><p>Of course, he had plenty of those, because he was always equipped with numerous ingredients with which to concoct medicine. However, even if he sold them all, the merit points they would earn would vanish just as quickly as his spirit stones.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t keep going on like this, or I'm going to die! This Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect is just too wicked! I can\u2019t believe they treat their disciples so harshly! I'm a Gold Core expert! I'm an important political hostage! Don\u2019t they even care that I\u2019m starving to death!?!?\u201d Depressed, he even considered resorting to theft. However, the punishment for theft in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect was so severe that he quickly abandoned such thoughts.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, I\u2019m out of options. I guess I\u2019m going to have to use my best skill to solve this problem. I'm... I'm going to concoct medicine!\u201d</p><br/><p>--</p><br/><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Deathblade.<strong> Chinese language consultant:</strong> ASI a.k.a.

He wasn\u2019t sure exactly what to think about imposter Nightcrypt. On the one hand, he felt a bit sorry for him. However, having taken over his identity, he had to deal with the possibility that he might have some sort of relationship with any female disciples he ran into. If they were pretty, he might even think about acknowledging their affections.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, none of the female disciples who would willingly hand medicinal pills over to Nightcrypt were very good-looking at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good thing nobody knows who I really am. Otherwise my true reputation might be irreparably stained.\u201d Sighing, he decided that in the future, he would do his best to stay indoors.</p><br/><p>With that, he began to practice cultivation. Normally speaking, he wouldn't work so hard at cultivation, but the benefits of working with the Undying Heavenly King in this place were too good to not take advantage of. He knew that he had an unprecedented opportunity here, and it couldn\u2019t be abandoned.</p><br/><p>After some thought, he even tried to use the Undying Live Forever Technique to produce a drop of true Undying Blood. Unfortunately, Undying Blood came from the final volume, and at this point, all he could do was absorb blood qi from the area. It was impossible to form it into Undying Blood at this point.</p><br/><p>Even still, he was very excited at the prospects laid out in front of him. He also surreptitiously cultivated the Violet Qi Heavenspan Incantation, continuing to melt the Heavenspan River water that was in his spiritual sea.</p><br/><p>His true cultivation base was making constant progress. Furthermore, his Heavenspan Dharma Eye, which was hidden by the powers of the mask, was also becoming more powerful.</p><br/><p>What he anticipated most, though, was the Mountain Shaking Bash.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter reaching the power of ten mammoths, I can form the Berserk Ghost Body. Then I\u2019ll have completed the first level of the Undying Heavenly King!\u201d As he continued to work with the Undying Heavenly King volume and absorb blood qi, he felt his power growing, and it filled his heart with anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn a few days, I should have the power of two of those primeval mammoths. I'm already getting close to the power of ten! And I'm only on the back of the hand. Once I get onto one of the fingers, I should progress even more quickly!\u201d In his excitement, he thought about how the five mountain peaks of the Blood Stream Sect all had blood waterfalls. Presumably, if he practiced cultivation near a blood waterfall, his progress would be incredible.</p><br/><p>Sighing, he couldn\u2019t stop thinking about how the Blood Stream Sect really was his own personal Holy Land.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t abandoned his work with protomagnetic power and the Human Controlling Grand Magic. Although he hadn\u2019t performed any experiments recently, he had spent a lot of time thinking about and analyzing the subject.</p><br/><p>A month flew by.</p><br/><p>During that time, he never left his immortal's cave. However, he was able to observe the area outside, and frequently saw Blood Stream Sect disciples fighting each other. At one point, he even saw a disciple get killed not too far away from his immortal's cave.</p><br/><p>If that had happened in the Spirit Stream Sect, it would have been a huge deal. But in the Blood Stream Sect, it didn\u2019t cause much of a commotion. However, he did hear from someone passing by that the person who had killed the other disciple had been summarily executed. After all, the Blood Stream Sect allowed fighting, but not killing, and they strictly enforced their rules. Anyone who crossed the line would meet a brutal end.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s like they\u2019re raising scorpions....\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought. Although the Blood Stream Sect seemed chaotic and without rules, the truth was that there was an order to it.</p><br/><p>A few more days passed, and word was passed down that an arrangement had been made for those who failed in the Foundation Establishment Holy Lands. Just as the disciple had said in the meeting, they would have a chance to join a trial by fire to reach Foundation Establishment.</p><br/><p>To qualify for the trial by fire, they had to accomplish a mission set forth by the sect. Each person received a different mission, and Bai Xiaochun\u2019s was to go to Corpse Peak and refine a corpse!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun found the nature of the mission somewhat revolting. However, despite the fact that the mere idea of working with corpses was disgusting, he couldn\u2019t change the task. If he wanted to eventually get to that relic of eternal indestructibility, he would have to grit his teeth and accept the mission.</p><br/><p>That was the only way he could get into the trial by fire, get the Foundation Establishment Pill, and \u201creach\u201d Foundation Establishment. Then he could choose to become a Dharma protector on Middle Peak.</p><br/><p>On his way to the Blood Stream Sect, he had often thought about showing up as an Earthstring Foundation Establishment expert. Although some of the disciples who escaped from the Fallen Sword World might have seen Nightcrypt be killed, there were ways to explain how he was now alive. After all, everyone had life-saving magics. However, if he showed up with an Earthstring Foundation Establishment cultivation base, that would be a different matter. Despite the chaos in the Fallen Sword World toward the end, everyone had been paying very close attention to the earthstring energy and who was absorbing it.</p><br/><p>Returning to the sect as an Earthstring Foundation Establishment cultivator would have been too suspicious, so in the end, he abandoned the idea.</p><br/><p>The next day at sunrise, Bai Xiaochun left his immortal's cave in high spirits. Carrying the mission jade slip with him, he headed toward Corpse Peak. It was only with that jade slip that he could actually enter Corpse Peak.</p><br/><p>There were lots of corpse refineries on Corpse Peak, even some at the base of the mountain.</p><br/><p>That was exactly where Bai Xiaochun needed to go to accept his assigned mission. Even from a distance, he could see the corpse refinery that was his destination. It was a huge building, cylindrical and pitch black. Noxious black smoke belched out of the top of the building to rise up into the sky.</p><br/><p>There were numerous entrances and exits to the building, with Inner Sect disciples going in and out of them constantly. Grave expressions could be seen on the faces of the disciples who left the building, and their skin was pale, as if they hadn\u2019t seen the light of day in years. They were people who, unlike Bai Xiaochun, had taken the initiative to accept corpse-refining missions from the sect for the purposes of cultivation and study.</p><br/><p>As he walked up to the corpse refinery, he suddenly caught sight of someone familiar. It was Xu Xiaoshan, who stood there at the main gate leading to the refinery, his hands clasped behind his back. His cultivation base emanated the fluctuations of Earthstring Foundation Establishment, and he had three grim-looking bodyguards standing behind him as he reprimanded several of the Inner Sect disciples. [1. Bai Xiaochun befriended Xu Xiaoshan in chapter 152]</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know how much I paid to buy this corpse refinery from the sect, fools?</p><br/><p>\u201cThis place is mine! I had to sell all of my other properties to afford it. If I don\u2019t make enough profit to buy paper talismans, you people are going to be sorry!</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe you destroyed one of my corpses! It might have been nothing more than an ordinary corpse, but it was still worth something. I'm warning you, the lot of you had better pay me back, otherwise I\u2019ll turn you into corpses to be refined!\u201d The Inner Sect disciples were trembling, their faces pale as they immediately admitted their failures. Finally, Xu Xiaoshan waved his hand in irritation to dismiss them.</p><br/><p>A dark expression on his face, he glanced around the area and caught sight of Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing here? You can\u2019t just come and go as you please around here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun took a moment to compose himself. If Xu Xiaoshan had dared to talk to him in such a way in the Fallen Sword Abyss, he would have made short work of him. But now, all he did was wave his right hand, sending the mission jade slip flying toward him.</p><br/><p>Xu Xiaoshan frowned as he examined the jade slip. Then he looked back at Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember you. You were there when we were all fighting Bai Xiaochun. So, you made it out alive after all!\u201d His expression softened a bit. He had mixed feelings about everything that had happened in the Fallen Sword Abyss. He still admired Bai Xiaochun from the Spirit Stream Sect, and when he thought about how they had fought and conned each other, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy is definitely the jewel of the Spirit Stream Sect now,\u201d he thought, shaking his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cAlright, come on inside. Considering we're both veterans of the Fallen Sword Abyss, I\u2019ll give you a few tips about corpse refining.\u201d As Xu Xiaoshan led the way, Bai Xiaochun put a sinister expression onto his face and followed.</p><br/><p>Before long, they were in one of the private rooms inside the corpse refinery, which was usually referred to as a corpse cave.</p><br/><p>The cylindrical chamber wasn't very large. Nine oil lamps emanated a mysterious light that nevertheless failed to dispel the grim darkness. In the middle of the room was a deep cistern.</p><br/><p>The water was the color of blood, and looked bizarre and fantastic. Floating there in the water was a dead person!</p><br/><p>The corpse belonged to a burly man with a vicious expression on his face. He didn\u2019t look like a kind person in any way, and there was a fatal wound on his forehead. The skin around the wound had withered significantly, transforming into a pattern that resembled a plum blossom.</p><br/><p>Xu Xiaoshan wasn\u2019t familiar with all of the corpses in all of the corpse caves, but as soon as he saw this one, he whispered, \u201cThis guy got killed by that shrew Xuemei. The fact that he died fighting her indicates that he must have had an extraordinary cultivation base when he was alive.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun peered over at the corpse, and the mark on its forehead. Immediately, his heart went cold.</p><br/><p>\u201cObviously, on Corpse Peak, we focus on corpses,\u201d Xu Xiaoshan continued. \u201cGenerally speaking, the corpses start out ordinary and slowly advance through the levels until they reach the pinnacle. The levels are as follows: pallid zombie, shadow zombie, flying ghoul, grand lich!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour mission is to get this corpse to grow white hair. Then it will turn from an ordinary corpse into a pallid zombie!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe method to do so is explained in this jade slip. Considering you\u2019re in the tenth level of Qi Condensation, and have been around for awhile, you\u2019ve probably heard a bit about how it works. Use your cultivation base to catalyze the blood cistern, and then sink the corpse down inside. Of course, there are a lot of other details you have to master.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you work quickly, you can accomplish the task in half a year.\u201d With that, he handed Bai Xiaochun two jade slips. One of them contained information about the corpse refining methods, and the other could be used to control the corpse itself. Then, he turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun didn't want to waste that much time, though. Looking over at the corpse, he asked, \u201cIs there any way to get it to go faster?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Xiaoshan chuckled coldly. \u201cFaster? Of course! If you give the corpse enough spirit medicine, then naturally the process will go faster. In fact, if you're good enough, maybe you could make a Nine Serenities Blood Pill. With one of those, you could finish within ten days. Plus, the corpse would be a grand lich, about as powerful as a patriarch!</p><br/><p>\u201cI forgot that you can actually do a bit of medicine concocting. Maybe you should give it a shot.\u201d He chuckled again. Blood Stream Sect disciples usually spent their time fighting, and most viewed medicine concocting as a waste of time. Xu Xiaoshan flicked his sleeve and left Bai Xiaochun alone in the corpse cave.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked down thoughtfully at the corpse floating in the cistern, and soon, his eyes lit up.</p><br/><p>\u201cThey didn't like me concocting pills in the Spirit Stream Sect, but now I\u2019m in the Blood Stream Sect. I can finally do some pill concocting again....\u201d Becoming a grand apothecary really was proving to be a big headache. He sighed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

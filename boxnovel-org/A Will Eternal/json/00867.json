His enthusiasm even seemed to give him an extra burst of power, and yet, he knew how to refrain from being impulsive. The black sea of flames beneath his feet roared to life, surrounding him as he backed away from the fighting.</p><br/><p>At the same time, Patriarch Dao River performed an incantation gesture with his right hand, causing the sword qi around him to converge into the shape of an illusory greatsword, which thrummed with the will of the heavens as it slashed toward Bruiser!</p><br/><p>Patriarch Dao River didn\u2019t deign to pay any attention to Bai Xiaochun, nor the violet beam of light that shot out from his third eye. The man simply waved his sleeve, sending a portion of sword qi out to intercept it.</p><br/><p>However, the instant the sword qi touched the violet light, the sword qi shattered, completely incapable of standing up to the violet light. Shocked, Patriarch Dao River tried to back up, but couldn\u2019t avoid the light. It latched onto him, and instantly took control of his body.</p><br/><p>His face fell, and his heart began to pound as Bai Xiaochun blurred to a stop\u2026 right in front of Bruiser!</p><br/><p>Bruiser let out an excited howl, unable to prevent the joy from burning in his eyes. Bai Xiaochun was essentially Bruiser\u2019s father, someone who could solve any problems!</p><br/><p>Bruiser depended on Bai Xiaochun in the way that only relatives could!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun immediately let out a shout, shoving his right fist out toward the greatsword. When Patriarch Dao River saw that, he immediately relaxed a bit, and his eyes began to shine with coldness.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis violet light is strange, but this kid is too young and inexperienced. I can\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t take the opportunity to try to injure me. For him to make contact with my incisive sword qi is simply courting--\u201d However, before he could even finish his inner monologue, his eyes bulged as surely as if he had seen a ghost.</p><br/><p>When the sword qi in which he had placed so much confidence struck Bai Xiaochun\u2019s fist, a popping sound could be heard, and the sword qi shattered!</p><br/><p>It couldn\u2019t have collapsed more surely if it had encountered a metal wall. As for Bai Xiaochun, he wasn't harmed at all as the remnants of the sword qi scattered in all directions.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Dao River shivered and gasped. The fact that Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t harmed at all by power comparable to the will of the heavens was shocking, to say the least.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re a deva too!!\u201d he blurted. When the people in the area heard that, they were immediately shaken, and looked over with disbelieving eyes. As for the River-Defying Sect disciples, their excitement began to mount.</p><br/><p>Inside the Blood Ancestor, Patriarch Spirit Stream and Patriarch Blood Stream were both delightedly shocked, as was the monkey. In contrast, Patriarch Starry River and Patriarch Polarity River were both shaken, and their killing intent grew more pronounced.</p><br/><p>\u201cHave a death wish?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun growled, his eyes completely bloodshot because of all the wounds and scars he could see on Bruiser, especially that vicious neck wound. Howling in rage, he shot toward Patriarch Dao River.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Dao River\u2019s heart sank. However, he was a deva. It didn\u2019t matter that he was only in the Mortal-Dao level, he was still proud and arrogant. Therefore, he performed an incantation gesture with both hands, causing more streams of sword qi to erupt out. Numerous greatswords appeared, fully 100,000 of them, which then descended onto Bai Xiaochun like rain.</p><br/><p>Any one of those swords could seriously injure a Nascent Soul cultivator. They contained Patriarch Dao River\u2019s will, which surpassed that of the heavens, and also contained a huge convergence of the energy of heaven and earth. His goal was obviously to kill Bai Xiaochun as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Patriarchs Starry River and Polarity River began to rush over to help cut this cocky Bai Xiaochun down to size!</p><br/><p>As the two other patriarchs took to motion, Patriarch Dao River\u2019s 100,000 greatswords bore down on Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiaochun, he strode forward, unleashing the explosive fleshly body power of the great circle of the Undying Bones! With that power, he utilized\u2026 the Mountain Shaking Bash!!</p><br/><p>It was an incredible level of energy that caused heaven to shake and the earth to rumble. He shot forward with blinding speed, looking very much like a vicious beast from primordial times.</p><br/><p>The air shattered around him as he moved, and to the shock of Patriarch Dao River, he was right in front of him before the rain of swords could even land!</p><br/><p>A boom rang out, and blood sprayed from Patriarch Dao River\u2019s mouth. He tried to fall back, but before he could, Bai Xiaochun took advantage of the momentum he had built up to reach out with this thumb and index finger. Black light flashed, along with a powerful gravitational force.</p><br/><p>It was none other than\u2026 the Throat Crushing Grasp!</p><br/><p>A tremor passed through the retreating patriarch, and his eyes lit with terror as Bai Xiaochun closed in on his neck with lightning-like speed.</p><br/><p>It was a critical moment, and Patriarch Dao River had no time to ponder what to do. It wasn\u2019t that he had never fought with other devas before; it was that he had never encountered someone as shockingly fast as Bai Xiaochun. He seemed brutal, as though he had veins of steel that made him willing to die fighting with his enemy. It was a madness that seemed bereft of any and all reason. And yet, at the same time, there was something crafty and intelligent within his killing intent, something that was like battle instinct!</p><br/><p>The massive waves of shock that battered at Patriarch Dao River\u2019s mind caused him to gasp loudly. Patriarchs Starry River and Polarity River had no time to offer backup. Roaring, Patriarch Dao River sent the 100,000 greatswords swirling through the air to try to block Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>As the rain of swords closed in, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered, and he completely ignored them! Instead, he dashed forward, reached out, and grabbed the patriarch\u2019s right arm. Then, he squeezed down!</p><br/><p>The shocking power of the Throat Crushing Grasp caused cracking sounds to fill the air as the deva\u2019s arm was ripped to shreds! His entire arm was completely destroyed!</p><br/><p>A shrill scream escaped his lips, and his face turned ashen. Madness lit up his eyes, and yet, within that madness was shock; this was the most powerful enemy he had encountered since becoming a deva!</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, he had no desire to fight Bai Xiaochun one-on-one. Taking a deep breath, he burned longevity to power a secret magic that propelled him backward at incredible speed.</p><br/><p>However, in the moment that he took to motion, Bai Xiaochun unhesitatingly utilized his Undying Hex. Everything in the world suddenly slowed down, with the exception of himself. Then, he burst into motion as he chased after the fleeing Patriarch Dao River!</p><br/><p>What everyone else saw was Bai Xiaochun seemingly moving faster than sound as he pursued the patriarch!</p><br/><p>He caught up in the briefest of moments, whereupon he clenched his hand into a fist and then punched out with deva-level fleshly body power, adding in energy from his cultivation base.</p><br/><p>Blood sprayed out of the deva\u2019s mouth as his chest caved in. His life force was fading rapidly, and his expression was one of complete terror. He immediately began to contemplate other ways to flee.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, he could clearly sense\u2026 the shadow of death!!</p><br/><p>Patriarchs Starry River and Polarity River were urgently rushing over, but Bai Xiaochun had attacked with such unbelievable speed that they still hadn't arrived. Unfortunately, they were very close. Realizing that, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered, and a tremendous burst of frigid qi appeared, filling everything within a 3,000-meter area!</p><br/><p>It was like a frigid lake, or\u2026 a frigid domain! Furthermore, within that domain\u2026 appeared nine projections of Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>They shot like lightning toward Patriarch Dao River, and before he could do anything, pierced through him multiple times, provoking a bloodcurdling scream!</p><br/><p>Booms rang out as the patriarch\u2019s head flew through the air, and the rest of his body exploded. He remained in existence only in nascent divinity form, utilizing a secret magic and other life-saving magical items to evade destruction. Flickering weakly, and screaming in terror the entire time, he flew away, leaving behind the shattered remnants of his fleshly body.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The more he pondered how amazing the bow was, the more excited he got, and at the same time, realized he had put on too good of an act earlier. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t have ended up scaring his lucky star away. \u00a0[1]\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cI probably shouldn\u2019t call him Mr. Gorilla in the future. What a pity this labyrinth is so big. Most likely I won\u2019t run into him again.\u201d Sighing, he realized that he already missed Zhou Yixing.</p><br/><p>A moment later, he looked back down at the fire soul arrow with its elevenfold spirit enhancement. The arrow only continued to leave him more shaken, especially with the way it seemed to flicker back and forth between illusory and corporeal. The longer he looked at it, the more he felt like it was tugging at his own soul.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs the arrow itself extraordinary, or... or is it the elevenfold spirit enhancement that\u2019s made it so incredible?!\u201d Taking a deep breath, he thought back to the Heavenhorn Sword back in the River-Defying Sect, with its tenfold spirit enhancement. How might that sword change if it had an elevenfold enhancement? Presumably, it would be even more incredible than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat an awesome arrow,\u201d he thought, quickly putting the arrow into his bag of holding. Patting his bag contentedly, he mused that he really had profited well by coming into the labyrinth.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmmmphh. I bet nobody in this labyrinth is richer than me, not even that deva. I've got stuff in my bag of holding that would shock even him!\u201d Although he was quite proud of himself, he also couldn\u2019t forget all of the ordeals from the past several days, and the bizarre things that had occurred. That left him feeling a bit stiff, and drove away any feelings of pride. He even had to remind himself that he mustn\u2019t allow himself to grow lax in his caution.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo amount of riches is worth more than my poor little life!\u201d Shaking his head, he looked around cautiously before proceeding forward.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, in a tunnel not too far away from Bai Xiaochun, starlight swirled, and Zhou Yixing stepped out into the open, coughing up a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>By this point, the star sigil on his forehead was visibly cracked, and looked like it might collapse at any moment. Zhou Yixing felt like weeping about it, although he currently had no tears to shed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all your fault, Bai Xiaochun!!\u201d he raged as he stood there trembling and ashen-faced. \u201cYou took my nine-colored flame and my fire soul arrow. Damn you, Bai Xiaochun!! If it wasn\u2019t for you, I never would have even come here. Damn you and damn this labyrinth!!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Zhou Yixing felt like he was hovering on the verge of going insane. As of this moment, he only had one teleportation left before his star sigil was destroyed for good.</p><br/><p>Before entering the labyrinth, he couldn\u2019t have possibly guessed that it would be so dangerous, and that he would have to rely on the power of his star sigil so many times. By now, he completely regretted his decision.</p><br/><p>\u201cI absolutely, positively must not run into any of those bizarre entities.... And I definitely have to avoid Bai Xiaochun.... I can\u2019t believe my fire soul arrow didn\u2019t kill him. He\u2019s completely inhuman!\u201d Sighing, he began to creep forward, mind focused on a single thing: finding the exit, leaving, and never coming back. As for Bai Xiaochun... he had already made a decision. After he got back home, he would ask his entire family to track him down and kill him.</p><br/><p>As Zhou Yixing was resolving to avoid Bai Xiaochun at all costs, Bai Xiaochun was proceeding through the labyrinth, feeling dizzy from how all the walls looked exactly the same.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is that exit...?\u201d he thought anxiously. \u201cThis is crazy! I\u2019m totally turned around. Alright, whatever. I\u2019ll just count this intersection as my starting point!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Taking a deep breath, he took out a jade slip and then continued with his previous custom of sticking to the right. This time, however, he tried to take measured, uniform steps. At the same time, he began to trace out his path in the jade slip. It took patience, but he stuck with it. Whenever he reached intersections, he would pick the right-hand side. Gradually, an outline of his route began to take shape in the jade slip.</p><br/><p>A few more days went by. By this point, he had been in the labyrinth for nearly a month.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, he had plenty of spirit alcohol, which helped him keep his cultivation base and battle prowess sufficiently powered. However, he would still run into occasional situations in which he needed to draw upon spirit energy, and after a few more months passed, he began to run low on spirit alcohol.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s anxiety continued to build, and he started to lose track of time. One day, he suddenly saw movement up ahead of him in the corridor.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201d he said loudly, pulling out his Eternal Parasol.</p><br/><p>However, whoever it was up ahead completely ignored him and kept moving. Heart pounding, Bai Xiaochun was about to start backing away when he suddenly saw clearly who it was up ahead of him, and his jaw dropped.</p><br/><p>It was one of the cultivators from the Great Wall, someone he recognized. However, to his shock, he realized that the man\u2019s eyes were completely blank, and his face was slack and expressionless....</p><br/><p>His cultivation base seemed to have slipped back down into Foundation Establishment, and even more strange was the fact that he wasn\u2019t really walking! His feet dragged on the ground, and although he wasn\u2019t floating through the air, it almost seemed like he was being pushed along from behind.</p><br/><p>The man didn\u2019t seem to notice Bai Xiaochun, who stood there wondering exactly what was going on. He thought about taking the initiative to attack him, but then hesitated and decided not to inadvertently provoke him. Instead, he simply stepped to the side and watched him closely as he passed by.</p><br/><p>The entire time, the man didn\u2019t stop or even look at him. He just walked on by. That was when Bai Xiaochun\u2019s gaze fell upon the man\u2019s back, and suddenly, he felt all the hair on his body stand up on end.</p><br/><p>\u201cWh-wh... wha... what is that?!\u201d Backing up, his face drained of blood as he looked at what was sticking to the man\u2019s back. It was... a life-size person made of paper!!</p><br/><p>The paper person had arms, legs, and a head with a lifelike face! It was stuck to the cultivator\u2019s back as if it had always been a part of him, and yet, Bai Xiaochun could tell that life force and cultivation base power was flowing constantly from the cultivator into the paper person.</p><br/><p>The paper person\u2019s eyes were closed, but Bai Xiaochun could clearly see that its expression, and also its facial features, were slowly coming to resemble the cultivator it was stuck to.</p><br/><p>The bizarreness of the spectacle caused Bai Xiaochun to shiver in fear, and even place his hand over his mouth from the horror. Worried that he might attract the attention of the paper person, he simply watched the cultivator trundle off into the distance. Then he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat the hell is this place...?\u201d he thought. Whether it was the red hats, the blood-soaked buns, or this paper person, everything gave him a feeling of terror.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the paper person seemed like something that couldn\u2019t be fought against using the cultivation base, but rather, something that affected the soul directly.</p><br/><p>After everything which had occurred so far, Bai Xiaochun was feeling very jumpy. Not daring to continue in the direction he had been heading, he picked a new path and continued to try to keep track of his progress. However, despite his vigilance, he soon realized that there were five people up ahead. Two were Great Wall cultivators, two were soul cultivators, and there was even a savage giant. Furthermore, all of them were trudging along just like the cultivator he had seen earlier.</p><br/><p>Because they were walking away from him, and thus had their backs to him, he could see that there were paper people stuck to all of them....</p><br/><p>Sucking in a quiet breath, he began to back up, and then picked another direction. However, to his shock, it wasn\u2019t long before he ran into a group of ten cultivators, all of whom had paper people stuck to their backs....</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit, what\u2019s going on?\u201d Bai Xiaochun anxiously picked a new path to follow, and after a bit of time passed and he didn't see any paper people, he finally breathed a sigh of relief. The next day, as he was walking along, he suddenly stopped in place when he realized that someone was heading toward him at top speed from up ahead.</p><br/><p>It was a soul cultivator, and as soon as the man caught sight of him, his expression turned grim. After sizing Bai Xiaochun up to get a sense of his power, he snorted coldly and continued to fly through the air at top speed...</p><br/><p>Originally, Bai Xiaochun had been happy to find that the man\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t blank like all the other people he had seen recently, and was about to call out a greeting. However, when the man flew past him, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes went wide.</p><br/><p>There on the soul cultivator\u2019s back was a paper person! Clearly, the man had no idea the paper person was there. A moment later, the paper person\u2019s eyes opened and it looked at Bai Xiaochun with an odd smile. Then it raised a finger to its lips and pursed its lips as if to say <em>sshhh</em>....</p><br/><p>Apparently, it was telling Bai Xiaochun that it was involved in a game of hide-and-seek, and that he shouldn\u2019t say anything....</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was so scared that his face went completely ashen. Goosebumps broke out all over him, and he even began to sweat. Worried about some misunderstanding with the paper person, he nodded, and even slapped his chest to emphasize that he wouldn't speak up....</p><br/><p>The paper person seemed to understand, and nodded in satisfaction before closing its eyes again.</p><br/><p>After the soul cultivator disappeared into the distance, Bai Xiaochun wiped the sweat from his brow.</p><br/><p>\u201cThese paper people must be able to sneak up on you without you ever realizing it....\u201d Nervous, he suddenly looked over his shoulder.</p><br/><p><span class=\"footnote\" id=\"footnote_1\">[1] Don\u2019t forget the \u2018star\u2019 wordplay involved with Zhou Yixing</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

After all, this Grandmaster Bai was a terrestrial necromancer, the most powerful necromancer Li Feng had ever met.</p><br/><p>The benefits of being a follower of a person like that defied description, and Li Feng knew that if he didn\u2019t seize this opportunity, he would regret it for the rest of his life. Aware that he had to do something to make himself valuable, he quickly cried, \u201cWait for me, Grandmaster Bai! I can be of a lot of use. For example, when you need souls, I can go looking for them for you. I can also--\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun paused midstride. After all, the things that Li Feng was saying made sense.</p><br/><p>As for Zhou Yixing, his heart was starting to pound with anger. Back before Bai Xiaochun had proved to be a terrestrial necromancer, he had felt that being his follower was somewhat of an insult. But now things were completely different; as far as he was concerned, Bai Xiaochun was almost like a deva.</p><br/><p>Zhou Yixing had done a lot of boot-licking to try to get Li Feng kicked away, only to have him shamelessly offer to do the same things that he himself was responsible for.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can do that too!\u201d he shouted, worried that Bai Xiaochun would agree.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun blinked a few times, but maintained his calm. He could tell that these two viewed each other as competition, and the truth was, he was actually pleased by that. Without saying anything, he continued along.</p><br/><p>Feeling a bit better, Zhou Yixing glared over at Li Feng and pondered how he would stomp him to death if his cultivation base were unsealed....</p><br/><p>Li Feng couldn\u2019t just sit around and let Zhou Yixing act like this. Turning anxiously toward Bai Xiaochun, he raised his voice and said, \u201cGrandmaster Bai, I... I know a place where you can get a huge amount of souls!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo do I!\u201d Zhou Yixing shouted immediately. \u201cI know lots of places like that!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can concoct soul medicine for you, Grandmaster!\u201d Li Feng said. \u201cI'm at the peak of the master necromancer rank, so I can make plenty of soul medicine to keep you safe, your majesty!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can concoct soul medicine too!\u201d Zhou Yixing said through gritted teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re pushing things too far, Zhou Yixing! I know a place where you can get Heavenspan River water! That stuff is incredibly valuable! Even a single drop can get you tons and tons of soul medicine! Can you match that, Zhou Yixing?!\u201d Li Feng shouted.</p><br/><p>\u201cI....\u201d If Zhou Yixing were back home, he could definitely do that, but here, there was no way....</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes brightened. He had been aware that Heavenspan River water was rare in the Wildlands, and that it was valuable, but he had never really put much thought into exactly how valuable it would be....</p><br/><p>Seeing that Zhou Yixing appeared to be at a loss for words, Li Feng started to get excited, and immediately began to list out all his selling points in the hopes that he could get Bai Xiaochun\u2019s attention.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cI know somewhere you can get a deva soul!</p><br/><p>\u201cI can gather all kinds of information from the area!</p><br/><p>\u201cI can--\u201d</p><br/><p>Eyes bloodshot, Zhou Yixing was just about to offer a retort when Bai Xiaochun suddenly stopped and turned around.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Then, Zhou Yixing\u2019s heart began to pound as he realized that Bai Xiaochun was staring at Li Feng.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you just say that you know the location of a deva soul?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bursting with excitement at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s reaction, Li Feng immediately clasped hands and bowed deeply.</p><br/><p>\u201cGrandmaster Bai, your humble servant absolutely has some information about a deva soul. According to the rumors, the Giant Ghost King himself has one. In addition to him, each of the three great necromancer clans within Giant Ghost City territory also has one!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun frowned. From what he could tell, this information might as well be a complete fabrication.</p><br/><p>Zhou Yixing was delighted to see Bai Xiaochun frowning, and decided that he had to counter attack. \u201cHmph. The Giant Ghost King is a demigod expert. How could you possibly just take a deva soul from him?! And as for what you said about the necromancer clans, that\u2019s pure speculation!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Li Feng stared at him coldly for a moment, then chuckled. Putting a very respectful expression onto his face, he looked at Bai Xiaochun and said, \u201cHow could I possibly do anything to deceive Grandmaster Bai? Obviously, the deva soul possessed by the exalted Giant Ghost King is not something to go after. As for the necromancer clans, there are two who I can't say for certain have a deva soul. But one of them does. I\u2019d stake my life on that fact!</p><br/><p>\u201cI was once a vassal in that very clan, and during one of their ceremonies, I had the honor of seeing that deva soul with my own eyes. It bore the semblance of sandy soil, and instantly caused incredible pressure to weigh down in the entire area!\u201d As soon as Bai Xiaochun heard Li Feng\u2019s complete description, his eyes sparkled.</p><br/><p>Deva souls were precious treasures in the Wildlands just like they were in the lands of Heavenspan. They were the type of thing that few people could ever lay eyes on, and as such, few people knew what they would look like. However, Li Feng\u2019s description matched the description exactly.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf he\u2019s telling the truth, then that means he saw an earth-type deva soul. I already have fire, wood, and water.... I'm just missing metal and earth!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart was palpitating in eagerness.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhich clan are you talking about?\u201d Bai Xiaochun asked, his eyes sparkling.</p><br/><p>Li Feng hesitated for a moment, but considering that his chance to be Bai Xiaochun\u2019s follower was at stake, he finally said, \u201cThe Bai Clan, on the east outskirts of the city!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. The clan Li Feng had just mentioned sounded very familiar, and when he realized why, his jaw dropped....</p><br/><p>\u201cThe east outskirts of the city\u2026\u201d he thought. \u201cThree great necromancer clans... the Bai Clan.... Isn\u2019t that the clan Bai Hao came from?\u201d Such thoughts got his heart pounding. \u201cBut a clan like that, a great clan attached to Giant Ghost City... they must have a deva patriarch!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun licked his lips, and yet, was still hesitating. However, he absolutely had to get more deva souls, and considering that he was already masquerading as Bai Hao, it would probably make things easier.</p><br/><p>As he hesitated, the nervous Li Feng began to give more information about the Bai Clan. As far as he was concerned, even offending the Bai Clan would be worth it if he could be Bai Xiaochun\u2019s follower.</p><br/><p>Although he had served at the Bai Clan as a vassal, he had never noticed Bai Hao during that time. After all, Bai Hao was only in early Foundation Establishment, and wasn\u2019t considered an outstanding member of the clan. It would only be natural for Li Feng, a master necromancer, to ignore him.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind spun as he considered the matter for a long moment. Finally, he gritted his teeth and thought, \u201cI might not succeed in the end, but I should at least give it a shot. After all, I do have my demigod pagoda.... Even if my identity gets exposed, I shouldn\u2019t be in too much danger.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>At the same time, his anger toward Mistress Red-Dust smoldered. After all, if it weren\u2019t for her, he wouldn\u2019t need to get deva souls to step into the Nascent Soul stage.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all the fault of that shrew Mistress Red-Dust. Once I\u2019m awesome enough, I\u2019ll definitely teach her a lesson! And the same with Chen Hetian!\u201d Finally, he made his decision, and formally agreed to let Li Feng be his follower. With that, the three of them flew off in the direction of the Bai Clan.</p><br/><p>Along the way, Bai Xiaochun reviewed the bone slips he had found in Bai Hao\u2019s bag of holding, and also thought about the circumstances surrounding Bai Hao\u2019s death. Obviously, returning to the clan as Bai Hao would probably cause something of a stir.</p><br/><p>\u201cVery well, Bai Hao. If I get a chance, I\u2019ll figure out who\u2019s responsible for your death and get revenge!\u201d</p><br/><p>A few days later, they were closing in on the Bai Clan. Obviously, it wouldn\u2019t do to take Li Feng and Zhou Yixing with him, so at a certain point he stopped and arranged for them to stay in the vicinity and work on their cultivation, ready to come the instant he called for them.</p><br/><p>He dropped his cultivation base from the great circle of Core Formation down to where Bai Hao\u2019s had been, in early Foundation Establishment, and also flew a bit slower than before, doing everything he could to make himself look like Bai Hao should. He even put a taciturn expression onto his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Hao was a bastard son, so the clan probably doesn\u2019t care about him very much....\u201d It only made sense to him that Bai Hao wouldn\u2019t look very happy to come back to the clan after almost being killed.</p><br/><p>This area was considered the outskirts of Giant Ghost City, and all of it was controlled by the Bai Clan. It was a huge area, populated to the point where it was essentially a huge city.</p><br/><p>The city was violet, and almost looked like it had been imprinted into the earth itself from above. The city wall was formed by statues of dragonsnakes, which formed together to make four huge gates, the entrances to the clan!</p><br/><p>There was clearly a spell formation at work, which emanated terrifying pressure that both filled the Bai Clan and made it stand out among the lands that surrounded it.</p><br/><p>As soon as Bai Xiaochun entered the vicinity of the city, he felt eyes on him from all directions, although no one looked at him for too long.</p><br/><p>As for the power of the spell formation, it caused his heart to tremble. \u201cThe Bai Clan... definitely has a deva patriarch!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

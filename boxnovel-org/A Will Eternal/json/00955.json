The woman was not middle-aged, but neither was she young. However, she was very beautiful, albeit grimly frightening. Of the three men, two were older, and one was middle-aged. The latter was very handsome, with sword-like eyebrows and eyes that glittered like stars. Bai Xiaochun had seen quite a few handsome male cultivators in his time, but had to admit that none of them could compare to this man in terms of good looks.</p><br/><p>In fact, it left him feeling a little prickly. This middle-aged cultivator was just <em>too</em> handsome. Plus, he had a very high cultivation base. Considering how his eyes glittered, he was clearly the type who female cultivators would find incredibly attractive.</p><br/><p>By this point, the cultivators from the west and south, including Master Thousand-Ghost and Guru Spirit Immortal, had all backed away from the eastern cultivators.</p><br/><p>Zhao Tianjiao and Bai Lin both had nervous expressions on their face. As for Song Que, he wasn\u2019t quite sure how to feel. Although he was nervous, he was also itching to see what Bai Xiaochun would do.</p><br/><p>After all, it seemed like an irresolvable situation. The northern devas probably wouldn't dare to actually kill Bai Xiaochun, but it seemed unlikely that they would hold back from unleashing their fury on him.</p><br/><p>Song Que was right in his assessment. The twin Master Cloud Lightnings had sent messages on their way back, which led to the northern devas immediately coming to cause problems for Bai Xiaochun upon his arrival.</p><br/><p>The twin Master Cloud Lightnings chuckled coldly, their eyes flickering with icy light. \u201cHmph! Maybe we can\u2019t handle him alone, but with everyone together, it should be easy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun suddenly felt the pressure building up. Although he was in a despondent mood, this sudden development with the devas caused his heart to begin to pound. Without the twin Master Cloud Lightnings, the Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect had four devas. However, if the twin Master Cloud Lightnings were counted\u2026.</p><br/><p>Then Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t sure if that meant they had six devas or five\u2026. Either way, he would be completely dominated. And that wasn\u2019t even mentioning the fact that there was a demigod in that crystal coffin up above.</p><br/><p>To have four enormous deva faces staring down at him caused him to groan inwardly. In fact, if the twin Master Cloud Lightnings weren\u2019t present, he would definitely look around in confusion and ask who Bai Xiaochun was\u2026.</p><br/><p>But now, he had no choice but to take a deep breath and stare back with bloodshot eyes.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm a mighty and majestic deva!\u201d he thought. \u201cEven if my bones get broken and my blood gets spilled, I can\u2019t let myself look scared!\u201d Heart thrumming with madness, he stepped forward, looked up at the faces and\u2026 slipped his arm around Du Lingfei\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>Du Lingfei had already been trying to think of a way to resolve the situation, but before she could even do anything, Bai Xiaochun stepped forward and put his arm around her.</p><br/><p>Shocked, she looked over. To any observer, Bai Xiaochun would look impressive to the extreme, the type of person who looked down condescendingly on all creation\u2026. Then, in front of all of the cultivators from the north, west, and south, and as the eastern cultivators looked on nervously to see how things would play out, Bai Xiaochun leaned over and kissed Du Lingfei loudly on the cheek\u2026.</p><br/><p>Song Que\u2019s eyes went blank with shock, and the twin Master Cloud Lightnings frowned. The northern devas looked on in shock\u2026 especially the handsome cultivator, whose eyes began to burn with anger.</p><br/><p>\u201cWifey,\u201d Bai Xiaochun said loudly, \u201csince our dad, the exalted Celestial, is gone, that leaves it up to us to patrol the north. Oh, I seem to remember that you have an Elder Brother here, right? Could you put in a good word for me with him? Actually, since we\u2019re already here in the north, we should probably go offer some formal greetings!\u201d</p><br/><p>Song Que gasped out loud. Zhao Tianjiao and Bai Lin stared with eyes as wide as saucers. As for Master Thousand-Ghost and Guru Spirit Immortal, they looked on with expressions of complete disbelief.</p><br/><p>Although the twin Master Cloud Lightnings had been aware of the general situation, they could never have guessed that Bai Xiaochun would so shamelessly bank on his tenuous connection to the demigod patriarch.</p><br/><p>The other northern devas were clearly hesitating. The truth was that even they were scared of Du Lingfei. At the same time, they were profoundly struck by how shameless Bai Xiaochun was!</p><br/><p>\u201cA mighty and majestic deva who seeks help from a woman! What kind of a clown is this guy?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis Bai Xiaochun is exactly like the rumors say he is! He\u2019s treacherous, crafty, and has no sense of shame!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun couldn't care less what the crowd was thinking, and even gave a proud harrumph. As far as he was concerned, only an idiot would start a fight in a situation like this.</p><br/><p>Du Lingfei was feeling very out of sorts. Face scarlet, she glared over at Bai Xiaochun, opened her mouth, and was about to say something when an enraged shout interrupted her from above.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet your filthy hands off of her, Bai Xiaochun!!\u201d It was none other than the handsome, middle-aged deva, who became a bright beam of light that shot down toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>He had a mid Deva Realm cultivation base, and drew fully upon it, becoming a destructive meteor that bore down on Bai Xiaochun in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was a bit surprised by this handsome cultivator\u2019s outburst, but there was no time to ponder the situation. Without any hesitation, he clenched his left hand into a fist and punched out into the air toward the man.</p><br/><p>A rumbling boom could be heard, and Bai Xiaochun fell back a few paces, as did the handsome cultivator. At the same time, a murderous aura sprang up from Du Lingfei, and she shouted, \u201cWhat do you think you're doing, Feng Chen!?\u201d</p><br/><p>Pointing angrily at Bai Xiaochun, Feng Chen said, \u201cLingfei, I can\u2019t believe this cretin would dare to sully you in my presence! I'm going to kill him!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was more than a little surprised at how this handsome Feng Chen addressed Du Lingfei. Blinking a few times, he looked at Du Lingfei and said, \u201cYou two know each other?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before Du Lingfei could reply, Feng Chen blurred into motion, attacking Bai Xiaochun yet again. At the same time, the other devas began to move in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun gasped at the sensation of so much killing intent directed at him. There were four devas coming at him from all directions, making escape impossible. No matter which way he dodged, he would be facing a dangerous attack. At this point, cracking sounds filled the air as he roared and drew upon the Living Mountain Incantation!</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, he used the Mountain Shaking Bash, the Undying Hex, and a quintuple-power Undying Emperor\u2019s Fist!</p><br/><p>The frigid coldness in the area suddenly grew more intense. The four northern devas were clearly surprised by this shocking fist strike, and yet none of them backed up. Instead, they continued on with full force to meet it.</p><br/><p>A huge boom rang out, and Bai Xiaochun staggered backward. At the same time, the twin Master Cloud Lightnings leaped into the fray. Now there were six devas working together. As they closed in, they sealed off the spiritual power in the area, making it more difficult to utilize divine abilities.</p><br/><p>At this point, Bai Xiaochun let out a shout as he got ready to crush one of his drops of Undying Blood. After all, he had no other options at his disposal; these people were being complete bullies, leaving him with only his Godkiller technique, which he couldn't control very well!</p><br/><p>\u201cCultivators from the other three river branches,\u201d he said, \u201cback up immediately!\u201d It was a critical moment in which Bai Xiaochun was just about to use the Godkiller. Only a few breaths\u2019 worth of time had passed since the northern devas made their move, and already, it was a dangerous situation.</p><br/><p>At this point, Du Lingfei looked up at the crystal coffin and spoke in a loud voice, \u201cElder Brother Zhou, is this how you treat your Junior Sister when she brings people for a visit?! According to the rules my father set for the trial by fire, deaths would be unavoidable. Don\u2019t tell me the north plans to use governmental authority to avenge private grudges?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant Du Lingfei finished speaking, laughter rang out from the crystal coffin. Then, the sky flashed with bright colors as a young man appeared out of thin air. He waved his hand, and although it didn\u2019t seem like he exerted any power to do so, massive force exploded in the air between Bai Xiaochun and the other devas!</p><br/><p>The six northerners\u2019 divine abilities were instantly suppressed, and a gentle force shoved them backward. Things didn\u2019t go as smoothly for Bai Xiaochun, though. His divine abilities were forcefully crushed, and a powerful force slammed into him.</p><br/><p>He grunted, coughing up a mouthful of blood as he staggered backward several steps. Gasping for breath, he looked up with bloodshot eyes at the young man hovering up above, radiating demigod fluctuations.</p><br/><p>A very grim expression overtook Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face. Were it not for his unusually strong fleshly body, the blow from just now would have seriously injured him.</p><br/><p>The young man glanced at Bai Xiaochun, then shifted his gaze to Du Lingfei, toward whom he smiled and said, \u201cLittle Junior Sister, do you really need to talk to your Fourth Elder Brother like that? Well, I guess I shouldn\u2019t get into any bickering. Men, activate the teleportation portal and send these cultivators back home to the other three river branches!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, elders from the Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect activated the teleportation portal, causing rumbling sounds to fill the sect. Master Thousand-Ghost and Guru Spirit Immortal offered respectful greetings to the demigod patriarch, and then led their subordinates to the teleportation portal. Within moments, they vanished.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun suppressed his rage, and led his own people toward the teleportation portal, surrounded by the sarcastic gazes and cold comments of the northern cultivators, as well as the naked killing intent of the devas.</p><br/><p>However\u2026 it was in that moment that intense fluctuations which surpassed the demigod\u2019s suddenly descended onto the Nine Heavens Cloud Lightning Sect. The demigod\u2019s face fell, and even Du Lingfei looked surprised. Bai Xiaochun and the easterners looked up to see an enormous magical symbol descending from the sky. At a certain point, the symbol shattered, and a solemn voice echoed out in all directions!</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun is hereby appointed as a special guard to the emissary. He will assist Heavenspan Emissary Du Lingfei\u2026 in an inspection tour of the north!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

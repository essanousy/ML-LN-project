Then, unable to maintain control of her mind and body, she lapsed into unconsciousness.</p><br/><p>Red Dust Violet Road!</p><br/><p>Even Mistress Red-Dust could only utilize this technique by overdrawing on her deva cultivation base and also draining her longevity. As the final words left her mouth, and she was beginning to collapse, red light shot out from her finger, becoming a red smoke that instantly enveloped Gongsun Wan\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Gongsun Wan\u2019er shrank down and down, dragged by the chains until she was inside of the tiny city!</p><br/><p>To any observer, that city would be the size of a hand, but to Gongsun Wan\u2019er, it now looked like any ordinary city. In fact, as she looked, a horse cart sped by, sending dust roiling up to cover everything in sight.</p><br/><p>This was none other than\u2026 Red Dust Violet Road!</p><br/><p>It was a city that was both illusory and corporeal, and was in reality\u2026 a shocking sealing magic!</p><br/><p>Anyone sealed in that city would be locked inside of an illusion from which they could not escape. In fact, even if they managed to break free from the city, they wouldn\u2019t find themselves free, but rather, outside of the city in another world!</p><br/><p>As the dust from the passing horse cart filled Gongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s vision, she calmly looked up into the sky at the gigantic forms of Bai Xiaochun and Mistress Red-Dust. Then she smiled.</p><br/><p>Despite the fact that Bai Xiaochun had been protected by his mask, when he had attacked just now, she\u2026 had sensed his true aura!</p><br/><p>\u201cSweetie\u2026.\u201d she said with an odd smile. Then she began to chuckle, the sound of which floated out of the city to fill the area.</p><br/><p>The sound of the chuckling filled Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart with dread. Obviously, even the powerful sealing magic at work could not contain Gongsun Wan\u2019er for very long. Furthermore, with his own current battle prowess, he was obviously nowhere near a match for her.</p><br/><p>Therefore, it was without the slightest hesitation that he picked Mistress Red-Dust up into his arms and shot away with blinding speed.</p><br/><p>As he disappeared, Gongsun Wan\u2019er was back in the tiny city, about to be covered over by dust. And yet, she was still chuckling. As she did, she extended her right hand, performed an incantation gesture, and waved her finger.</p><br/><p>In response, the burly Lei Shan, who had remained unmoving at the bottom of the nearby crater this entire time, suddenly opened his eyes, which were expressionless and dark. Then, he rose to his feet!</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as he flew up into the air, the massive wound in his chest rapidly healing. Then, he looked in the direction of the fleeing Bai Xiaochun, his face expressionless</p><br/><p>\u201cBring him back to me!\u201d Gongsun Wan\u2019er said from within the city, even as the dust settled down onto her. At that point, with her voice still echoing out into the world, it was for the first time that her eyes turned blank.</p><br/><p>She was now completely immersed within the sealing of the Red Dust Violet Road technique!</p><br/><p>Outside of the city, Lei Shan\u2019s eyes flickered with dark light as he unhesitatingly drew upon all the power he could muster to shoot after Bai Xiaochun with lightning-like speed!</p><br/><p>A piercing whistling sound filled the air as he flew along, and the air around him even distorted! Several thousand kilometers ahead of him, Bai Xiaochun gasped for breath as he sped along, carrying the unconscious Mistress Red-Dust on his back.</p><br/><p>Afterimages spread out behind him as he pierced through the air.</p><br/><p>At one point, he pulled out a transmission jade slip and tried to send a message to the Giant Ghost King. However, the entire area was still locked down by some unknown technique employed by Gongsun Wan\u2019er.</p><br/><p>Even as he huffed and puffed, he could feel Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s lithe, supple body suddenly turn stiff. At that point, he realized that she had regained consciousness.</p><br/><p>When Mistress Red-Dust awoke to find herself laying on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s back, it felt very strange. Struggling a bit to speak, she said, \u201cPut me down. I don\u2019t need your help!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up!\u201d he said angrily. \u201cThis is all your fault. I told you I had a bad feeling. Don\u2019t waste my time, woman! You don\u2019t need my help? Can you even stand on your own?!?!\u201d With that, he reached back and spanked her on the rear end\u2026.</p><br/><p>In his dismay and anxiety, the feeling of his hand bouncing off of her caused a strange heat to rise up inside of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!!\u201d Zhou Zimo spat. Considering how weak and anxious she was, the fact that Bai Xiaochun had berated her and then struck her rear end caused anger to burn in her heart. However, she was so weak that she could barely breathe, so the spike of emotion actually caused her to pass out again, whereupon she lay motionless on his back.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph. If it weren\u2019t for the sake of my old pal Giant Ghost, do you really think I would have saved you? You\u2019re always looking at me like you want to kill me, you know. What, do I owe you money or something?!\u201d With another cold snort, he ignored Mistress Red-Dust and focused on speeding along as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>By this point, he had already detected Lei Shan following him a few thousand kilometers back. Bai Xiaochun had mixed feelings about Lei Shan. He knew that he was obviously dead, and had been transformed into something like his own corpse troopers.</p><br/><p>And corpse troopers were virtually impossible to kill!!</p><br/><p>Unless one was vastly more powerful than a corpse trooper, and could literally rip it to pieces and transform it to ash, it would be impossible to wipe out.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh, Lei Shan. We tangled once when you were alive. Now, even after you\u2019re dead, you still want to keep at it\u2026. I guess my only option is to pick up some extra speed!\u201d Sighing, he slapped his bag of holding to produce a heavenly airship, and then began to head in the direction of Giant Ghost City!</p><br/><p>As soon as he leaped onto the deck, he tossed Mistress Red-Dust off to the side and then poured all his cultivation base power into the airship. It immediately began to glow with bright light, and then shot forward with speed that vastly surpassed the speed he himself was capable of.</p><br/><p>However, even as Bai Xiaochun accelerated, Lei Shan threw his head back and let out a shocking howl. Suddenly, he burst into flames, and then picked up speed at an alarming rate. In the blink of an eye, he was moving far faster than the heavenly airship, a bright beam of light that bore down right onto Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>With every moment that passed, he got closer! 1,000 kilometers. 750 kilometers. 500 kilometers. 250 kilometers. In a flash, he was only about 50 kilometers away!</p><br/><p>The sight caused Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes to turn as wide as saucers. Gulping, he muttered, \u201cWhat kind of medicine did this guy take!? I can\u2019t believe he\u2019s so fast!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s nervousness mounted, Mistress Red-Dust woke up again and looked over at him with mixed emotions in her eyes. Then she noticed Lei Shan closing in on them, whereupon her eyes shone with decisive light.</p><br/><p>\u201cGet this heavenly airship going faster, Bai Hao! With enough speed, you won't have to worry at all about that puppet!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShut the hell up, would you!?\u201d Bai Xiaochun shouted back in frustration. Mistress Red-Dust\u2019s bossy tone was really getting on his nerves. At this point, he was the one who had saved her, and yet she still dared to toss around orders like she was in charge.</p><br/><p>It left him feeling far from pleased.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou!!\u201d she said, glaring daggers. By this point, she had actually realized that her tone of voice wasn't completely appropriate, and yet considering how proud she was, there was no way she would admit it openly.</p><br/><p>Before she could say anything else, Lei Shan burst forward with another flash of speed, putting him\u2026 right above the airship!!</p><br/><p>There, he shoved his right hand down!</p><br/><p>Instantly, a massive force erupted out from him, becoming a blast of wind that descended onto the airship.</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew the hell off!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun shouted. By now, his veins of steel were pulsing, and his murderous aura seethed. Clenching his right hand into a fist, he leapt up into the air and punched!</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds spread out that could shake heaven and earth. The wind attack collapsed, and Bai Xiaochun, who hadn\u2019t even slowed down a bit, continued onward toward Lei Shan!</p><br/><p>As for Lei Shan, his eyes flickered with black light as he shot downward, slicing his hand in a deadly attack toward Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

His expression flickered as he realized that boundless life force was flowing through him.</p><br/><p>This life force conformed with his Undying Live Forever Technique, and therefore, met no obstacle within him. It almost seemed like it belonged with his cultivation base, and as a result, it only took a brief moment for his withered and nearly destroyed body to be almost completely healed.</p><br/><p>During the process, his fleshly body power skyrocketed. In the blink of an eye, he went from Qi Condensation to Foundation Establishment, and then Core Formation!!</p><br/><p>As it happened, his Undying Skin, Undying Heavenly King, and Undying Tendons\u2026 all recovered completely. Furthermore, Bai Xiaochun could sense that this version of the Undying Codex was somehow different than what he had cultivated before!</p><br/><p>It was\u2026 stronger! The life force was more vibrant, and its energy was the type that could shake heaven and earth!</p><br/><p>Were it not for his previous experiences, it would have been difficult to detect. But considering how many years he had cultivated the Undying Codex, the sensation of fusing with this new energy left him completely shocked!</p><br/><p>If his previous mastery of the Undying Skin had led to him to a level of one hundred percent of his possible battle prowess, then after recovering now, it had increased\u2026 to one hundred and fifty percent!!</p><br/><p>It was a terrifying upgrade which would make him vastly more powerful than anyone in the same cultivation level as himself. It could only be described as heaven-defying!</p><br/><p>And it all came from the two skeletons which had turned into ash, and then become a consummate Undying Live Forever Pill!</p><br/><p>Apparently\u2026 this amazing pill was not just helping him recover his fleshly body and life force. It was also refining him in an incredible way. Now, his fleshly body power didn\u2019t just match someone who had the pure blood of the Arch-Emperors, it surpassed it!</p><br/><p>Cracking sounds echoed out as his Undying Tendons solidified, and he rose rapidly through the levels of the Undying Bones. Within mere moments\u2026 he had reached the great circle!</p><br/><p>He looked almost completely recovered. His hair was now back, long and full, and instead of being skinny and emaciated, he thrummed with vitality.</p><br/><p>The cracks on his skin were gone, and furthermore, he glowed with golden light. Anyone who could see him in this moment would definitely be shaken by the holy air that he exuded.</p><br/><p>At this point, he passed from the Undying Bones into the Undying Blood level!</p><br/><p>More cracking sounds echoed out as his blood once again transformed into Undying Blood. That in turn aided in his regeneration, making it speed up even more.</p><br/><p>The entire third level of the city around him was stained the color of blood, mixed within which was a tinge of gold!</p><br/><p>After about ten breaths of time passed, his veins were completely filled with Undying Blood, and a tremor passed through him. As of this moment, the sensation of fleshly body power that existed within him surpassed anything from before!</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUMBLE!!</p><br/><p>Early Demigod realm. Mid realm. Late realm\u2026. Great circle!!</p><br/><p>As the cracking sounds continued, his battle prowess rose higher and higher, to degrees difficult to even imagine.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun couldn\u2019t be absolutely sure, but he was fairly certain that, despite the fact that he currently had no cultivation base, his fleshly body power\u2026 was far, far higher than it had been before!</p><br/><p>The last time he had reached the great circle of the Undying Codex, he had only become a demigod in fleshly body, and only the early realm at that. But now\u2026. things were completely different! It came very close to being the same as the difference between heaven and earth!</p><br/><p>Although he could feel the pressure of the world weighing down on him, it wasn\u2019t very shocking at all. Furthermore, he felt like, if he wanted to, he could will himself to grow to incredible physical height!</p><br/><p>He could become as large\u2026 as the original Blood Ancestor!</p><br/><p>This was the true Undying Codex!</p><br/><p>This was what the descendants of the original Arch-Emperor had cultivated, a technique which gave them the power to prop up heaven and earth!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was even fairly certain\u2026 that he was now stronger than the Blood Ancestor himself!! Normally speaking, these developments would have elated him. However, at this moment, his heart was as cold as ice. The death of Bai Hao had filled him with pain that couldn\u2019t possibly be wiped away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThings aren\u2019t over yet!\u201d the gravekeeper said softly. \u201cAfter the Undying Codex is\u2026 the Live Forever Codex!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even as the words left his mouth, Bai Xiaochun spasmed. Although the medicinal pill had been eighty percent absorbed, there was still twenty percent left, which contained energy that did not belong to the Undying Codex. And now\u2026 that power erupted!</p><br/><p>It was the energy of the Live Forever Codex!</p><br/><p>As that power spread through him, Bai Xiaochun realized that it was familiar. A twinge of pain stabbed through him, the source being that scrap of power from the Live Forever Codex!</p><br/><p>\u201cBoo\u2026.\u201d he murmured. The life force from the Live Forever Codex poured into the scrap of energy inside of him, which then began to grow.</p><br/><p>Within only a few breaths of time, the Live Forever power caused his energy passageways to thrum, and his cultivation base to rise to the Foundation Establishment level!</p><br/><p>This type of Foundation Establishment surpassed his previous Heaven-Dao Foundation Establishment. This was\u2026 Live Forever Foundation Establishment!</p><br/><p>The moment he reached the level of Live Forever Foundation Establishment, he sensed\u2026 the five seals of the human body!</p><br/><p>A boom echoed out, and the first seal was destroyed!</p><br/><p>At that point, the remaining twenty percent of the power of the medicinal pill continued to flow through him, propelling him toward a Live Forever Core!</p><br/><p>\u201cListen well, Bai Xiaochun!\u201d the gravekeeper said as he passed his cultivation base, life force and everything about himself into Bai Xiaochun. Thanks to the power of the magical item that was Arch-Emperor City, he was able to continue to push Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation base higher, even beyond what the energy of the medicinal pill could do.</p><br/><p>Then, his voice echoed with focus and determination as he spoke his last words.</p><br/><p>\u201cI know you have many questions. And I know you hate me. Furthermore, you are surely curious\u2026 why I didn\u2019t just comply with the Celestial, and let him leave this world!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe reason is that\u2026 this world\u2026 actually has no Worldgate!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe so-called Worldgate\u2026 is nothing more than a fabrication I invented specifically for the Celestial!!!\u201d His words echoed out like peals of heavenly thunder into Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cWHAT?!?!\u201d Despite the fact that his cultivation base was rising rapidly, his mind was in complete chaos.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there was a Worldgate,\u201d the gravekeeper continued, \u201cI would have opened it long ago, and let the Celestial leave. There would have been no need for this complicated plan of mine!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe whole reason for all of this is because there is no Worldgate!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt is entirely possible for the living beings in this world to leave it. In fact\u2026 there are actually two ways!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe first would be for someone with the blood of the Arch-Emperors to cultivate the Undying Live Forever Technique all the way to the Mahayana Realm, and become a celestial. The world net which binds this world would not be able to resist a true celestial, and would collapse!</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, what would also collapse in that scenario\u2026 would be the entire world in which we live! All of the mountains and rivers, all of heaven and earth!</p><br/><p>\u201cAt that time, the celestial-level Arch-Emperor would gather up all of the living beings from the destroyed world, all of his people\u2026 and bring them with him as he left!</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the wider world outside, the Arch-Emperor Dynasty would then continue to prosper!\u201d The gravekeeper spoke quickly, ensuring that his words battered at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind without stop.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, they were finally revealing\u2026 a profound and tightly-kept secret!!</p><br/><p>It was in this moment that Bai Xiaochun\u2019s cultivation base broke through from the Live Forever Foundation Establishment level. At that point, something new appeared within him. It was\u2026 a Live Forever Core!</p><br/><p>As his Live Forever Core took shape, the second of the seals appeared, and was destroyed!</p><br/><p>It was also in that moment that the power of the medicinal pill began to falter. Clearly, it could not push him to the level of a Live Forever Nascent Soul!</p><br/><p>Therefore, it was now the gravekeeper\u2019s cultivation base that erupted with power and continued to bolster the power within him that could live forever!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

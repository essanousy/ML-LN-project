It looked back three times, seemingly reluctant to leave. Bai Xiaochun sighed, musing about the goodness of his deeds.</p><br/><p>During the following half month, he continued to go out into the Beast Conservatory and return with specially selected beasts. The Beastbirth Flower would swallow them up, and when they emerged, they looked drunk with pleasure, and would make their way off into the distance on unsteady legs.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun kept his selection very limited, choosing only from two hundred of the most special beasts.</p><br/><p>He wanted the flower to give birth to the ultimate battle beast, and therefore, he selected either the strongest or the largest of the beasts in the jungle.</p><br/><p>Eventually, all of the beasts which had offered contributions began to gather outside of the spell formation. Whenever Bai Xiaochun appeared, they would howl at the tops of their lungs, as if to ask for another chance.</p><br/><p>\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Bai Xiaochun replied firmly. \u201cOne contribution is enough. I don\u2019t want to harm you!\u201d Eventually, Bai Xiaochun brought the huge pangolin over to contribute, and that was when he realized he'd run out of good beasts to chose from.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he was well aware that the blooming period of the Beastbirth Flower didn't last for very long. Eventually, it would give birth to whatever was inside, no matter what it was. That was when he started to get nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis won\u2019t do. These beasts aren't enough to create the ultimate battle beast.\u201d Having reached this point in his train of thoughts, Bai Xiaochun left the Beast Conservatory to take a walk through the north bank. After observing all of the animals, he had come to be quite familiar with the disciples\u2019 battle beasts. He even knew which ones had the greatest potential for future growth, and which ones were the strongest.</p><br/><p>\u201cI remember one female Outer Sect disciple who had a peacock. It had great potential. That peacock should do nicely, shouldn\u2019t it?\u201d He quickly hurried over to the residence of that very female disciple.</p><br/><p>After waiting outside for a while, the young woman approached. She was quite well-known in the Outer Sect, and was very beautiful. As soon as she neared, Bai Xiaochun put a warm smile onto his face, and tactfully offered some merit points if she would allow her peacock to make an important contribution. Although he didn\u2019t mention the Beastbirth Flower itself, he did explain other matters in detail.</p><br/><p>Worried that she would reject the offer, he decided to add in one more bit of explanation.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon't worry. The contribution itself won\u2019t hurt the beast. You know, afterward, all of the beasts who've done it have looked drunk with pleasure. They all want a second round, as a matter of fact, but I was worried it would harm their vital energy, so I refused.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female disciple\u2019s expression slowly went blank. Although she wasn\u2019t exactly sure what he meant by \u201ccontribution,\u201d after hearing his further explanation, her eyes went wide with fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou... you pervert!\u201d she huffed. A bit tongue-tied, she stamped her foot and walked off.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s jaw dropped, and he felt a bit wronged.</p><br/><p>\u201cI just wanted to borrow your peacock! If you don\u2019t agree, that\u2019s fine, but there\u2019s no need to start cursing me. Bai Xiaochun is no pervert!\u201d Feeling a bit down, he went to the next person on his list. During the following days, he visited over a hundred disciples, and yet, not a single one agreed. In fact, many of them looked at him with very odd expressions.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun sighed and decided that since everyone was refusing, he might as well forget the idea. Having no other option, he would have to settle for second best and try out some of the other beasts in the Beast Conservatory.</p><br/><p>However, just when he was about to give up, something like a wind blew through the sect. Numerous disciples looked over at Bai Xiaochun with strange expressions on their faces, and began to whisper amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you hear? Bai Xiaochun has a very unique hobby....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFor the past few days, he's been going around asking to borrow battle beasts from people. He talks about some sort of contribution, and if you don't know what that means, well, come here, I\u2019ll explain it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so that\u2019s what it means! Heavens! I can\u2019t believe that Bai Xiaochun uses the beasts for.... Heavens! Is it really true?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rumors began to fly completely spontaneously. Apparently, after the north bank disciples realized they couldn\u2019t do anything about Bai Xiaochun, their malice toward him had gradually transformed into intrigue. As such, it only took a few days for everyone to have caught wind of the rumors.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know why Bai Xiaochun came to the north bank? It\u2019s the beasts! He has a special sort of love for them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow I get it! No wonder he made that Aphrodisiac Pill. It all makes sense now. He needed it for himself to begin with....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cChosen always have their eccentric hobbies. I'm just curious as to whether he prefers female beasts or male beasts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re wondering about something like that! Shh... keep your voice down. Look, I think I know the answer to your question....\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun heard the rumors, he was dumbstruck. The most extreme thing to happen was one evening at dusk when he happened to catch sight of a female disciple with a blue-eyed black cat. A bit curious, he looked over, whereupon the female disciple screamed at the top of her lungs and ran off at top speed.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun almost couldn\u2019t believe it all, and felt very wronged. He tried to explain things to people, and although they seemed to understand, the rumors only raged hotter.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat a bunch of bullies!\u201d he fumed. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy for me, Bai Xiaochun, to come to the north bank, completely impoverished. I minded my own business and tried not to offend anyone. I walked around with my tail between my legs, and yet, you people push things this far!? Slanderers!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eyes bloodshot, he gnashed his teeth.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going overboard, people! If all you\u2019re going to do is slander me, then I\u2019ll go get the beasts myself!\u201d Even as he burned with rage, he suddenly felt a wind blowing against his back. Looking over his shoulder, he didn't see anyone, but did notice a tree off to the side which was swaying back and forth.</p><br/><p>Next, a black blur sped toward him, openings its mouth to bite at his belly... the ferocious jaws instantly began to snap shut with terrifying power.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Bai Xiaochun was in the tenth level of Qi Condensation. Furthermore, after awakening from his deep enlightenment, his senses had become heightened. As such, he recognized what was happening and quickly fell back.</p><br/><p>Even as he did, a mouthful of razor-sharp teeth smashed onto the air a little more than a meter in front of him. The power of the bite was such that even the sound of it was shocking. It seemed to be filled with hatred.</p><br/><p>The black blur was none other than the Nightstalker Beast, the huge black dog. It was currently nighttime, which meant that it was much faster than it was during the day. Seeing that its second attempt to ambush Bai Xiaochun had failed, the dog quickly turned to flee.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou again!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, scalp numb, sweat dripping down his neck. He felt chills running up his spine; if he had been even a bit slower to react, then the dog would surely have bitten him.</p><br/><p>When he thought of what might have resulted, he shivered. He couldn\u2019t bet his life on his Undying Live Forever Technique....</p><br/><p>\u201cDamned black dog! It almost put an end to an entire Prestige clan!!\u201d He glared in fury as the dog ran off into the distance.</p><br/><p>\u201cIntolerable bullying!\u201d he raged. \u201cIf the north bank disciples want to bully me, that's one matter, but now a big dog is trying to do the same thing?! Last time I felt sorry for you, but this time, you\u2019re not getting off the hook!\u201d With that, wings sprouted from his back, and he flickered into motion.</p><br/><p>One man, one dog, they raced through the north bank at incredible speed.</p><br/><p>The dog was also very fast, and was very familiar with the area. Bai Xiaochun chased after it for almost an hour, until the sky was completely dark. He never was able to catch up, and yet his fury was not abated. The fact that he had been ambushed, and then completely left in the dust by the perpetrator, made him more angry than ever.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, the big black dog occupied the number two slot on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s list of hatreds. The number three spot was held by Elder Zhou\u2019s phoenix, and the number one spot... belonged to the abnormally stealthy talking rabbit. Nothing could ever take that first place spot away from the rabbit.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll chase you to the ends of the earth if I have to!\u201d Silver light flickered around him as the Undying Live Forever Technique was unleashed to its maximum effect, and his wings fluttered with protomagnetic power. In that moment, his speed instantly doubled.</p><br/><p>He transformed into a series of afterimages that quickly closed in toward the dog. In that moment, the dog silently attempted to duck into a cave, but before it could, Bai Xiaochun was there, reaching out toward it.</p><br/><p>As the hand neared, the black dog's eyes turned crimson, and it madly turned its head. Unexpectedly, it was completely disregarding its own safety to lunge toward Bai Xiaochun\u2019s belly and take out a bite.</p><br/><p>The dog had failed in its ambush before, so there was no need to even wonder if it could succeed when Bai Xiaochun was enraged and chasing after it. Before the dog\u2019s jaws could even bite down, a gurgling sound could be heard as Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand clamped down onto its throat.</p><br/><p>His hand was like an iron vice that completely prevented the black dog from escaping.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! Now we're going to see how awesome you are!\u201d Gritting his teeth, he headed back to the Beast Conservatory, and soon arrived at the honor guard station. After thinking for a moment about how to punish the dog, he suddenly looked over at the Beastbirth Flower.</p><br/><p>His heart twitched, and he chuckled darkly. With that, he tossed the dog toward the Beastbirth Flower, which swallowed it up in an instant.</p><br/><p>Two hours later, the flower opened, and the big black dog crawled out. Although its eyes shone with hatred and madness, there was something else in them as well. Before another moment could pass, it lunged at Bai Xiaochun, who grabbed it and threw it back into the flower.</p><br/><p>Another two hours passed, and the dog appeared again, just as maddened as before. Bai Xiaochun threw it back into the flower.</p><br/><p>After four times, the dog emerged, legs wobbly. It flopped onto the ground, panting.</p><br/><p>\u201cScared now?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, snorting coldly. \u201cProvoke me again, and I\u2019ll--\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could even finish, the black dog looked up at him and tried its best to reach out and bite him. Enraged, Bai Xiaochun grabbed the dog and threw it back into the Beastbirth Flower for another go. After five more times, it made a total of nine.</p><br/><p>After nine times, the dog was gaunt and listless. Seeing that, Bai Xiaochun picked it up, and it let out a miserable howl. Bai Xiaochun felt bad.</p><br/><p>\u201cNow do you understand what you have to be afraid of? Just don't provoke me any more. I had no choice but to do what I did in the Chosen battles.\u201d With this admonishment, he tossed the big black dog out of the honor guard station. The dog used what little energy it had left to flee off into the distance. When it got far enough, though, it turned to look back, and seemed like it was savoring sweet memories....</p><br/>\n</div>"}

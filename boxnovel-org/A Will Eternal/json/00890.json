Chen Hetian, Li Xiandao and Bai Zhentian had tossed out bait, but Bai Xiaochun had acted with incomparable decisiveness, disregarding the divine abilities they had sent against him to strike down Patriarch Starry River!</p><br/><p>The three remaining devas were shocked to the core. However, all of them were veterans of many battles, and therefore, it was without the slightest hesitation that they poured even more power into their divine abilities and magical techniques. The innumerable vicious faces that made up Chen Hetian\u2019s blood-colored fist shrieked ferociously as the fist grew larger and larger.</p><br/><p>The lightning net of ten thousand layers sliced through the air as it shot toward Bai Xiaochun, locking down all avenues of escape!</p><br/><p>And the cosmic chessboard grew more corporeal than ever. The celestial soldiers and generals attacked with mountain-toppling, sea-draining force.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was being assaulted with deadly force on all fronts and from all directions!</p><br/><p>The three devas had to admit that they had been careless earlier. Never could they have imagined that, before, Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t actually a deva, their carelessness would lead to both Patriarch Starry River and Patriarch Dao River perishing. It was a heavy blow to their self-confidence.</p><br/><p>Having reached this point in the battle, they felt they had no choice other than to push things to the extreme. If they killed Bai Xiaochun in the process, then at worst, they would lose some prestige in the process of explaining away the situation.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t come out on top, then not only would they have lost their deva subordinates, but they would also lose massive amounts of face, not to mention that they would have to deal with the future ramifications of having Bai Xiaochun alive and well in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect.</p><br/><p>After all\u2026 if they came out on the bottom, Patriarch Steel Veins would surely use that fact to his advantage.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we\u2019d known this guy would be so hard to deal with\u2026 we wouldn\u2019t have come!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, <em>if you ride a tiger, it's hard to get off</em>. Therefore, Chen Hetian, Li Xiandao and Bai Zhentian had no choice but to grit their teeth and intensify the power of their attacks. Since they had already committed some offenses\u2026 then they absolutely had to kill this opponent of theirs! That was the only way to resolve the situation!</p><br/><p>Deafening booms filled heaven and earth as Bai Xiaochun turned in place. There was no time for him to harvest Patriarch Starry River\u2019s soul in the face of this deadly attack!</p><br/><p>Although he was a Heaven-Dao deva, his opponents were three cultivators in the mid Deva Realm. There was no room for carelessness. A stern and awe-inspiring gleam could be seen in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes; as of this moment, he wasn\u2019t thinking about his actions at all. He was acting on pure instinct. He took a step forward, waving his hand to summon frigid qi, and within it, nine frigid projections.</p><br/><p>When the nine projections collided with the divine abilities of Chen Hetian, Li Xiandao and Bai Zhentian, they collapsed. And yet, cracks appeared on the blood-colored fist, the lightning net began to unravel, and the cosmic chessboard began to fall apart.</p><br/><p>That wasn\u2019t enough to stop the attacks moving against him, and yet, it had slowed them down, giving Bai Xiaochun time for his next move. Blurring into motion, he performed another incantation gesture with both hands, causing deva power to erupt out.</p><br/><p>\u201cViolet Qi Cauldron Summoning!\u201d he shouted. Instantly, violet light filled the sky as a gigantic violet cauldron appeared. In the blink of an eye, it transformed from illusory into corporeal!</p><br/><p>The truth was that it wasn\u2019t actually a violet cauldron. It was more than a hundred cauldrons, overlapping to create a glowing violet shield.</p><br/><p>The instant the shield formed, Chen Hetian\u2019s blood-colored fist arrived, along with the lightning net and the chessboard.</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOOM!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun shivered as his one hundred violet cauldrons collapsed one by one, causing intense fluctuations to roll out in waves. As he fell back, he resorted to the Living Mountain Incantation, as well as nine more frigid projections.</p><br/><p>More cracks than ever covered the surface of Chen Hetian\u2019s blood-colored fist, and one of the fingers was already collapsing into pieces. The lightning net was in similarly bad shape, and had only about 7,000 layers left. As for the cosmic chessboard, the five celestial soldiers were almost completely destroyed, and the heavenly generals were close behind.</p><br/><p>However, the three divine abilities looked just as impressive to anyone observing the fight from the outside, and seemed to be on the verge of wiping Bai Xiaochun out of existence!</p><br/><p>Before he had become a deva, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to hold out, not even by drawing upon every last technique he was capable of. Even his Undying Emperor\u2019s Fist wouldn\u2019t have been enough to save him.</p><br/><p>But now, things were different. Eyes flashing with strange light, he threw his hands first up, and then down.</p><br/><p>\u201cWaterswamp Kingdom!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A howl as if from another world erupted out, filling all creation. At the same time, water vapor roiled about, filling everything in sight!!</p><br/><p>The area involved was vastly larger than anything which had been seen before when the Waterswamp Kingdom was unleashed. The sky went dim, and winds screamed as curved mountains rose up. The mountains soon became claws, which grew larger and larger\u2026 until an enormous hand was visible!</p><br/><p>The scaled, pitch-black hand descended toward the divine abilities of Chen Hetian, Li Xiandao and Bai Zhentian, smashing into them, and causing the devas\u2019 faces to fall.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is this?!?!\u201d they shouted in alarm. Before they could react, the huge clawed hand smashed into the divine abilities.</p><br/><p>Three more fingers on the blood-colored fist were destroyed, leaving behind only a single finger. Even the palm was completely shattered!!</p><br/><p>Massive ripping and tearing sounds could be heard from the 7,000 layers of the lightning net as almost all of them were destroyed. Only 2,000 remained! Nearly eighty percent of the troops atop the chessboard were transformed into ash, and the chessboard itself was badly damaged.</p><br/><p>Although all of this takes a bit of time to describe, it happened with incredible abruptness. In the blink of an eye, the clawed hand was gone, and the three divine abilities were drastically reduced. Although none of them had been completely destroyed, they were significantly weakened, and as they bore down on Bai Xiaochun, he didn\u2019t do anything to evade them. Instead, he reached out with his right hand.</p><br/><p>A massive wind erupted out, slamming into the remaining finger from the blood-colored fist. When that happened, a tremor passed through Bai Xiaochun. Then the wind touched the lightning net, and he breathed in heavily, and took a step back. Lastly, he looked up as the wind smashed into the chessboard and its forces.</p><br/><p>Massive booms could be heard as the fist collapsed, the net shattered, and the chessboard exploded. Blood oozed out of the corners of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mouth as he staggered backward several steps. However, he wasn't significantly injured. He had mastered the Undying Bones, and as such, his eyes shone radiantly. His energy surged, causing all creation to tremble as an enormous, illusory version of his face appeared up above, and looked down menacingly at Chen Hetian, Li Xiandao and Bai Zhentian.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you\u2019ve got? Alright. Now it\u2019s my turn!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

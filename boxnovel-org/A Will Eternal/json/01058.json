He then prepared to speak, but before he could, he shivered, and a searing heat rose up inside of him that caused white mist to build up in the area.</p><br/><p>\u201cAn immortal fish!\u201d he exclaimed. He quickly settled down cross-legged to begin doing breathing exercises.</p><br/><p>After the Giant Ghost King experienced such success, Bai Xiaochun waited for a long moment to see if something similar would happen with himself. However, no heat appeared inside of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? It worked for the Giant Ghost King. Why not me?\u201d Then he looked around, and realized that there were a lot of bones around that they hadn\u2019t eaten. After randomly picking up a few, he crunched them up in his mouth and swallowed them, which was exactly when the warm current began to flow through him.</p><br/><p>Delighted, he closed his eyes. Soon, the warmth turned into something like a huge wave that pushed his Live Forever Codex further toward completion.</p><br/><p>Suppressing his excitement, he focused on the energy in his body. Time passed. Soon, roughly six hours had gone by since Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King began meditating.</p><br/><p>At that point, the Giant Ghost King opened his eyes, threw his head back and laughed uproariously. In that short six hours, the Giant Ghost King had made significant progress toward the late Demigod Realm.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad we only had one,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I could eat fish like that more often, I could reach the great circle in no time!\u201d</p><br/><p>At that point, Bai Xiaochun also opened his eyes, and they glittered with bright light.</p><br/><p>Although he hadn\u2019t made as much progress as the Giant Ghost King, that was because he was already further past him in general. Even still, the little bit of progress he had experienced was very exciting.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to break through to become a celestial, then he needed to reach the great circle of the Live Forever Codex. Unfortunately, he was still some distance away from that level. And unfortunately, the Live Forever Codex differed from the Undying Codex in that he had not actually personally cultivated it. It had been consecrated upon him.</p><br/><p>Although he had developed the divine abilities of the technique all the way to creating his Live Forever Lamp, the truth was that he still didn\u2019t really understand how to actually cultivate the technique.</p><br/><p>After the gravekeeper consecrated him, he came to the Eternal Immortal Domains and achieved a bit of progress. But it was slow to the point of being almost nothing. At the moment, his Live Forever Codex had reached the point where it was holding him back. He was basically at a major bottleneck.</p><br/><p>Based on what he could tell, if he practiced ordinary cultivation with the spiritual energy in Saint-Emperor City, then he couldn\u2019t achieve in ten years or more what he had just achieved by eating half of a heavenly dragonfish.</p><br/><p>Considering that, it was almost impossible to calculate how long it would take him to break out of the Demigod Realm by ordinary cultivation alone!</p><br/><p>His original plan had been to acquire some special medicinal pills or something similar. But now, looking around at the handful of fish bones that were left over, he realized that a new path had just been opened up.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne fish is worth at least fifteen years of cultivation!!\u201d All of a sudden, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes began to shine as brightly as a mouse that hadn\u2019t eaten for several years. \u201cIf I could get enough of those fish\u2026 breaking through this bottleneck would be super easy! I could become a celestial very soon!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was already getting very excited. For one thing, he would have much more longevity and life force after becoming a celestial, and for another, he would have his Daoseed, which meant he could be resurrected if he died. All of a sudden, he had the desire to reach the absolute pinnacle of this strange new world he was in. And it all came down to the heavenly dragonfish.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need fish!!\u201d He immediately began to look around and grab up all fish bones he could see. However, the Giant Ghost King seemed to have come to the same conclusion as him, and lunged to interfere!</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, Giant Ghost King, the Saint-Emperor gave me this fish as a reward. Don\u2019t you dare fight me over it!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes widened into a glare.</p><br/><p>\u201cLike hell! I'm your father-in-law, fool! Haven\u2019t you heard of filial piety!?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Bai Xiaochun furiously resorted to a trump card. \u201cThis is one of <em>my</em> leftovers! I actually licked it already!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh yeah? Well I licked all the other ones you already ate! We\u2019re related anyway, so it doesn\u2019t matter!\u201d Not willing to be outdone, the Giant Ghost King leaned forward and spat toward the fish bones on the ground\u2026.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because of some divine ability that he cultivated, but that one bit of spittle somehow managed to spread out and cover all of the bones\u2026.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun stood there, stunned at the Giant Ghost King\u2019s despicable and yet devastating tactics. Although he had to admit that the man was definitely thicker-skinned and a much better schemer than himself, that didn\u2019t explain how he was able to spit out so much saliva in one shot\u2026.</p><br/><p>As he stood there hesitating, the Giant Ghost King waved his sleeve, collecting all of the fish bones up and depositing them into his bag of holding. With that, he smiled complacently.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too inexperienced to fight with me, kid.\u201d With that, he laughed heartily.</p><br/><p>Dumbfounded, Bai Xiaochun sighed and was about to say something when both he and the Giant Ghost King realized that someone was approaching the blessed land. A moment later, they heard someone speaking outside.</p><br/><p>\u201cDuke Heavenspan, it's Chen Su, here for a visit.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first official visit Bai Xiaochun had received in Saint-Emperor City, and shockingly, the visitor was a celestial! Not only was Bai Xiaochun curious to see who it was, he also didn\u2019t want to cause any offenses, so he hurried over, waving his hand to open the main gate. Revealed outside was an old man with gray hair.</p><br/><p>He wore a long, blue robe, and bore the demeanor of a transcendent being. Smiling faintly, he clasped hands in formal greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was wondering why the birds were singing so happily earlier!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said. \u201cIt was because an honored guest was on his way! I never imagined it would be you, Fellow Daoist Chen! Please, come in!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s broad smile and clearly spoken words made him seem completely different than he had moments ago, struggling with the Giant Ghost King over fish bones.</p><br/><p>Chen Su laughed heartily at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s pleasing words. Nodding, he stepped into the blessed land.</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghost King was also curious about this visitor. Neither he nor Bai Xiaochun were cultivators of the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, and were considered foreigners. Although they both had official government positions, based on the information he had gathered earlier, he knew that most of the other government officials viewed them with a certain measure of contempt.</p><br/><p>And yet, almost overnight, someone had come to pay their respects. Furthermore, Chen Su was one of the four kings of the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, someone with a rank similar to Gu Tianjun. Shocked, the Giant Ghost King quickly clasped hands in a greeting of his own.</p><br/><p>Chen Su nodded at the Giant Ghost King, but then ignored him. After looking around the courtyard, he made some small talk with Bai Xiaochun, until finally clearing his throat.</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoist Bai, where is the heavenly dragonfish that His Majesty rewarded you with?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavenly dragonfish?\u201d Bai Xiaochun had been curious about the nature of the visit, so when Chen Su brought up the heavenly dragonfish, he was a bit taken aback.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, the heavenly dragonfish,\u201d Chen Su replied warmly. \u201cIf you\u2019d be willing to part with it, Fellow Daoist Bai, I\u2019d love to take it in trade.\u201d Chen Su, despite being a celestial, actually had no heavenly dragonfish. After all, they were considered the personal property of the Saint-Emperor, and were rarely given out as rewards. In fact, throughout all history, only a few hundred had ever been distributed.</p><br/><p>Each one was considered beyond priceless, and they were commonly referred to as national treasures, which was no exaggeration. In the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, people would pay astronomical prices to acquire even one. One of the main reasons for that was that their blood could be used as an immortal ingredient to concoct immortal pills.</p><br/><p>Chen Su was convinced that his proposal would not be rejected. Bai Xiaochun was a newcomer to the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, and wouldn't want to offend a celestial over a fish.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun hesitated for a moment, then said, \u201cUh\u2026 sorry, Fellow Daoist Chen, you\u2019re a bit late. I ate it already.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chen Su heard Bai Xiaochun\u2019s response, his eyes nearly popped out of his skull.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you just say\u2026 you ate it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun blinked a few times and then nodded. \u201cYep. Ate it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As far as Chen Su was concerned, Bai Xiaochun was obviously making up excuses. Voice cold, he said, \u201cCome on, Fellow Daoist Bai. Don\u2019t treat me like I\u2019m three years old or something. If you don\u2019t wish to part with it, just say so directly. Heavenly dragonfish are national treasures, and precious beyond imagination. Nobody who acquired one would ever possibly eat it! The best thing to do is keep it in a pond and extract its blood occasionally!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he flicked his sleeve as if to leave.</p><br/><p>At this point, Bai Xiaochun sighed and gave the Giant Ghost King a look. The Giant Ghost King, despite not really wanting to, produced some fish bones from his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cSee these fishbones, Fellow Daoist Chen\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Chen Su looked back and saw the bones, his eyes went wide. When he opened his mouth to speak....</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Countless mountain peaks crumbled, and numerous plains caved in. The entire world seemed to be breaking apart!</p><br/><p>The energy at play here seemed to be more than the world could handle, to the point where even the sky began to crack into pieces. All living beings were overwhelmed by the sensation that they were experiencing an apocalypse.</p><br/><p>Cities trembled, and sects were shaken. Living creatures everywhere sensed that the end was nigh!</p><br/><p>Cultivators from both the Wildlands and the Heavenspan region all sensed the same thing\u2026 that the world was dying around them\u2026.</p><br/><p>Unless someone or something intervened, it wouldn\u2019t be very long\u2026 before the world cracked to pieces!</p><br/><p>It actually had nothing to do with Bai Xiaochun himself. The process began\u2026 in the moment that the gravekeeper died!</p><br/><p>As everyone in the world looked around in astonishment, Bai Xiaochun sped through the Wildlands toward Heavenspan Island, his energy skyrocketing the entire way\u2026.</p><br/><p>There almost seemed to be no end in sight, as though the hatred and anger in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart would continue to push his energy higher and higher no matter what happened!</p><br/><p>Soon, he was in the Deadmire. There were no longer any restrictive spells locking the area down or protecting it, and as such, it was also beginning to fill with crevices and rifts\u2026.</p><br/><p>Heaven and earth were changing. The end of days had come! Bai Xiaochun could tell that beyond the shadow of a doubt!</p><br/><p>The hatred and anger in his heart manifested as a virtually undispellable murderous aura. His killing intent toward the Celestial burned with the ultimate madness.</p><br/><p>He yelled at the top of his lungs as he shot through the air, his eyes crimson with rage. He had never been like this before in his life, so consumed with hatred that it didn\u2019t even occur to him to be scared of death. He didn't care about his desire to live forever. The only things he could think about\u2026 were Du Lingfei\u2019s bitter tears, and how Bai Hao had kowtowed to him before passing away\u2026.</p><br/><p>Those two images were like sharp knives that stabbed through his heart all the way into his soul!</p><br/><p>He was truly insane!</p><br/><p>\u201cDaoist Heavenspan!!\u201d It was as if Bai Xiaochun had been reborn out of death, and none of his happiness had been passed on to the new version of him. The only thing that had been passed on\u2026 was his desire to kill the Celestial!</p><br/><p>He demanded blood. The blood of the Celestial!!</p><br/><p>Never could he forget the look in Du Lingfei\u2019s eyes when the Celestial pushed her head toward his. She hadn\u2019t wanted to hurt him, but had been given no choice. He could never forget how Bai Hao had burned himself into nothing to save him. Bai Xiaochun wanted to cry, but at the moment, there were no tears. Rage and enmity had burned them away, turning him into a being that sought only vengeance!</p><br/><p>Although he had been driven into madness, he still possessed all his faculties. He knew that the Celestial was incredibly powerful, and that although he himself had reached the great circle of the Undying Live Forever Technique, he would probably die if he fought him.</p><br/><p>Unless he achieved a cultivation base breakthrough, and truly stepped into the Mahayana Realm\u2026 he wouldn\u2019t have the battle prowess to crush the Celestial!</p><br/><p>But that didn\u2019t reduce his killing intent by even an iota. After all\u2026 he still had a trump card at his disposal, that being the world treasure of the north. Normally speaking, he wouldn\u2019t use it, considering the heavy price that would be paid to do so. But now, the world was already crumbling around him\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have other tools at my disposal as well\u2026 other than the world treasure of the north!\u201d Even as Bai Xiaochun burst out of the Deadmire and entered the lands of Heavenspan, his mind spun with numerous ideas and plans.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Undying Codex has five secret magics. As for the Live Forever Codex\u2026 it also has five powerful divine abilities. However, they\u2019re manifested in a different way. Once someone has mastered the entire Live Forever Codex, then the magic will take shape according to their personal Dao!\u201d Within Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mind floated five divine abilities that he had created after mastering the Live Forever Codex, divine abilities which were powerful enough to destroy anything in creation!</p><br/><p>Each person who cultivated the Live Forever Codex would produce different divine abilities. As for Bai Xiaochun\u2019s, they were an amalgamation of his subconscious mind, and the Daoist magics that he had cultivated in his life. And he was confident that\u2026 by combining them with the fleshly body power provided by the Undying Codex, they would make him far more formidable than anyone who had mastered a single one of the codices!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd I also have\u2026 my moonflower!\u201d Eyes shining as he pierced through the air, he suddenly waved his finger in the direction of the north, and sent a stream of divine sense in that very direction!</p><br/><p>\u201cMoonflower, baby!\u201d</p><br/><p>In response to his call, countless moonflowers suddenly burst into the air from the jungles and ravines in the north.</p><br/><p>They became like a cloud of dandelion seeds that streamed high up into the sky\u2026.</p><br/><p>From what he could tell, there were millions upon millions of them, filling the sky as they swirled together into the shape of an enormous moon.</p><br/><p>At a certain point, they vanished\u2026 to appear right next to Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>Seemingly delighted, the moonflowers swirled around Bai Xiaochun, each and every one of them radiating a sense of familiarity and love. For the first time, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s freezing heart warmed slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cMoonflower, baby, are you willing\u2026 to help me fight!?\u201d The response from the massive collection of moonflowers was a burst of fearless battle spirit!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun smiled in response. However, his eyes were fixed on Heavenspan Island, and they were as cold as ice. Without the slightest hesitation or anxiety, he suddenly summoned his turtle-wok!</p><br/><p>In response to the calling of his will, the millions upon millions of dandelion seeds began to converge together, eventually transforming into a single seed, which shot toward the turtle-wok!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun had already made the decision that, in order to make his moonflower stronger\u2026 he would bless it with a spirit enhancement!</p><br/><p>Although he couldn\u2019t conjure a twenty-two-colored flame, considering the level of his cultivation base, producing a twenty-one-colored flame was nothing difficult!</p><br/><p>He waved his hand, causing countless vengeful souls to stream toward him. As they did, he started with a one-colored flame, and conjured all the way up to a twenty-colored flame, using them to push the moonflower all the way to a twentyfold spirit enhancement. Then he conjured a twenty-one-colored flame!!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment to throw that flame into the turtle-wok. Instantly, rumbling sounds echoed out, and bright light began to shine out of the lines on the wok. Gradually\u2026 the design of the spirit enhancement appeared on the moonflower!</p><br/><p>Its aura was now vastly different than before. As its energy surged, it began to grow larger and larger, until it was a 30,000-meter-tall, shocking flower\u2026.</p><br/><p>Even more astonishing was the fact that it radiated the aura of the great circle of the Demigod Realm!</p><br/><p>However, it still seemed to view him just as lovingly as before. Accelerating, he had the moonflower shrink down, and then tossed it in his bag of holding. Soon\u2026 he was flying over the Heavenspan Sea!</p><br/><p>Cracks could be heard as rifts were torn open into the air, none of which showed any signs of closing back up!</p><br/><p>As he passed over the sea, the nearby water froze up\u2026. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s explosive aura was reaching a pinnacle!</p><br/><p>And his eyes were completely fixed on Heavenspan Island!</p><br/><p>As he closed in, he could see the Blood Ancestor, his entire body wreathed in flames, going all out to deliver a shocking fist strike. When the blow landed, a huge vortex sprang up, and the Blood Ancestor began to fade away.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re finally here, Bai Xiaochun! My mission is accomplished\u2026. Help me\u2026 to take care\u2026 of her\u2026.\u201d The Blood Ancestor threw his head back and laughed uproariously. He had given his life to lock down the Celestial, and therefore a gleam of contentment could be seen in his eyes as he looked in the direction of the north, and then faded out of existence\u2026.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t specify who he wanted Bai Xiaochun to take care of. He was sure that Bai Xiaochun already knew.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun nodded at the Blood Ancestor as he faded away. Then, he fixed his bloodshot, livid gaze\u2026 at the Celestial, who hovered in the air above the island!</p><br/><p>\u201cDaoist Heavenspan!\u201d he said, the words crackling like heavenly thunder!</p><br/><p>Heaven and earth crumbled around them!</p><br/><p>The most breathtaking battle of all time was about to begin!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

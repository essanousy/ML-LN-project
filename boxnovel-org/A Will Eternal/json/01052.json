Years ago, the Saint-Emperor Dynasty was almost completely crushed. However, once the Saint-Emperor made his breakthrough, the Vile-Emperor had no choice but to back down!</p><br/><p>\u201cNo one really knows how powerful archaeans really are. The two emperors have never fought each other directly. The only thing we know for sure is that they are strong enough to resurrect celestials!\u201d Gongsun Wan\u2019er looked at Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King, aware of how shocking her words must be to people who had never heard any of this information before.</p><br/><p>And she was right. Bai Xiaochun was panting, and the Giant Ghost King felt like he was being struck with waves of shock. Only now were they coming to understand how truly powerful the two imperial dynasties were. What they had seen so far was only the tip of the iceberg.</p><br/><p>\u201cAny demigod cultivator who breaks through and becomes a celestial must form a Daoseed and then deliver part of it to the Dao palace of the imperial dynasty they serve. Then, if that celestial dies, the archaean emperor can use that Daoseed to perform the resurrection!\u201d Gongsun Wan\u2019er paused for a moment to give Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King a moment to digest everything she had said up to this point. </p><br/><p>Then she continued, \u201cDiscounting the emperors, who normally do not take action, the celestials have the greatest battle prowess in the Eternal Lands!</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, resurrecting a celestial does not come without a price. Not only is it very draining to the archaean, but the resurrected celestial will forever be weaker than before!</p><br/><p>\u201cBecause of that, celestials will do anything in their power to avoid perishing.\u201d At this point, Gongsun Wan\u2019er stopped talking for a moment to think. There were more things to say that she could hold back, but they weren\u2019t exactly secrets. And once Bai Xiaochun and the Giant Ghost King got to the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, they would eventually learn of them.</p><br/><p>Therefore, there was little reason for her to not tell them.</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for my true self, even if you or the Saint-Emperor killed her, she would still come back to life. However, in order to keep the status quo, and to maintain the good will of the other celestials in the dynasty, the Vile-Emperor will almost certainly work out a deal to get her back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were shining by this point. Not only had he learned much more about how to become a celestial, but he now also knew much more about the shocking nature of the two emperors. However, after hearing the talk about resurrection, he had another suspicion that was even stronger than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Daoist Heavenspan dead or not!?\u201d Back when the Heavenspan Realm had been destroyed, Daoist Heavenspan\u2019s body exploded, and something that looked like a seed had flown out. \u201cHe was only a quasi-celestial. He couldn\u2019t have formed a Daoseed, could he\u2026?\u201d </p><br/><p>He also thought about how, after arriving in the Eternal Immortal Domains, he was able to use the Greatsword of the North without any limitations, and yet, the sword had no true master.</p><br/><p>Eventually, he put such thoughts to the side and looked back at Gongsun Wan\u2019er. He didn\u2019t care too much about whether or not she was given back to the Vile-Emperor. He needed her to use as his blood tribute. He had long since guessed that there were reasons he hadn\u2019t understood that prompted her to give herself up to him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s after the Archaean Realm?\u201d he asked.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the Archaean Realm?\u201d Gongsun Wan\u2019er smiled, her eyes shining with what appeared to be anticipation.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the Archaean Realm is\u2026 the Sovereign Realm!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUp to now, there have only ever been three sovereigns in our lands. They all existed at the same time, and were the forefathers of all humanity!</p><br/><p>\u201cPresumably, you already know about them. After all, the myths and legends that we all talk about in the Eternal Lands are true!\u201d Sighing, she looked up into the sky.</p><br/><p>The Giant Ghost King silently did the same, peering up at the huge face and two enormous hands!</p><br/><p>Every time the Giant Ghost King and Bai Xiaochun looked up at the strange sky overhead, their hearts and minds trembled.</p><br/><p>\u201cNot even I am sure about how to break out of the Archaean Realm and into the Sovereign Realm. Only the two emperors have any clue about that.\u201d With that, she shifted her gaze to the Eternal Sea.</p><br/><p>Down below, a mist could be seen on the surface of the sea, and beneath it, an enormous shape.</p><br/><p>That shape\u2026 was the landmass that existed in the very middle of the Eternal Sea.</p><br/><p>Perhaps \u2018island\u2019 was the best word to describe it. It was a holy location in the Eternal Lands, the place from which all people had originated!</p><br/><p>In the past, three enormous statues had existed there!</p><br/><p>After dying, the sovereigns became huge statues!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked over to where one of those statues had recently stood. The only thing visible there now was a huge footprint.</p><br/><p>Back when the Arch-Sovereign had been standing, Bai Xiaochun had lived inside his body, which was the Heavenspan Realm.</p><br/><p>No one spoke as the bone lizard battleship shot through the mists.</p><br/><p>Eventually, they were past the island and speeding along over the waves of the Eternal Sea. At that point, Bai Xiaochun murmured a single word.</p><br/><p>\u201cSovereign\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of the trip was made in silence. The Giant Ghost King was thinking about the Wildlands, Bai Xiaochun reminisced about the River-Defying Sect, and Gongsun Wan\u2019er was filled with endless sighs.</p><br/><p>After all, she was the focus of the current situation, and the closer she got to the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, the more worried she got, although she didn\u2019t let it show.</p><br/><p>Eventually, they were closing in on the immortal domain belonging to the Saint-Emperor Dynasty. At that point, Bai Xiaochun rose to his feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re almost there. Gongsun Wan\u2019er, please don\u2019t take offense\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gongsun Wan\u2019er frowned slightly and nodded. She had known all along that she would be sealed eventually, not to harm her, but to send the right message, and also to make sure that she was eventually traded back to the Vile-Emperor.</p><br/><p>Smiling at Bai Xiaochun flirtatiously, she said, \u201cBe gentle, sweetie\u2026 don\u2019t make it hurt.\u201d </p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart trembled in response, and the Giant Ghost King began to pant.</p><br/><p>Looking at her, Bai Xiaochun muttered a few words under his breath, then quickly performed an incantation gesture to send an invisible sealing mark into Gongsun Wan\u2019er. After being restricted, her energy faded slightly, and she sat down, ashen-faced and gasping for breath.</p><br/><p>And yet, her pitiful state only made her look more attractive.</p><br/><p>Not daring to lay eyes on her, Bai Xiaochun kept his eyes focused on the distant immortal domain.</p><br/><p>As the land mass grew larger and larger, he shivered inwardly, and then narrowed his eyes. He had just sensed a powerful aura up ahead, something explosive and dangerous, like an unsheathed sword!</p><br/><p>In response to it, the sky vibrated, and a screaming wind kicked up, causing the waves on the Eternal Sea to rise to incredible heights. At the same time, a beam of sword qi shot out from the immortal domain!</p><br/><p>It was fully 30,000 meters across, and powerful enough to crush anything in its path. As it closed in, the bone lizard shivered, and its eyes began to shine brightly.</p><br/><p>The air around the battleship was instantly sealed, causing intense pressure to weigh down that seemed capable of reducing anything and everything beneath it to a bloody paste!</p><br/><p>A serious expression appeared on the Giant Ghost King\u2019s face, and blood began to ooze out of his mouth. Gongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s expression flickered, and Bai Xiaochun looked out, his heart pounding. A moment later, the sword qi resolved into the shape of a handsome, middle-aged man in a white robe, with long white hair!</p><br/><p>It was with ice-cold eyes that he studied the battleship in front of him!</p><br/><p>That gaze was as explosive as heavenly lightning!</p><br/><p>In response to his presence, the sky shuddered, and the Eternal Sea went still. As for the bone lizard, it didn't dare to keep flying, and immediately came to a halt.</p><br/><p>\u201cGu Tianjun!\u201d Gongsun Wan\u2019er said. She no longer looked cute and charming. Instead, her eyes shone with mysterious light, but at the same time, terror!</p><br/><p>The white-robed, white-haired Gu Tianjun looked at Gongsun Wan\u2019er, and then at Bai Xiaochun. Voice utterly calm, he said, \u201cDelivery accepted. Now, please leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>Rage immediately rose up in the Giant Ghost King\u2019s heart, and Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickered with cold light. The pressure weighing down on them, and the words which had just been spoken, crossed the bottom line for the both of them! Gu Tianjun had come\u2026 with ill intentions!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

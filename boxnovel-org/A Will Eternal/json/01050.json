It was such a shocking event that in both the Vile-Emperor Dynasty and the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, it reached the point where everyone had heard about it. It only took a few days for the entire world to be affected.</p><br/><p>Among those who heard of it were the scattered refugees from the Heavenspan Realm. In response, eyes went wide, and gasps could be heard. And for the first time, hope blazed within their hearts!</p><br/><p>\u201cBai Xiaochun!\u201d In one huge huge city in a prefecture in the Saint-Emperor Dynasty was an old man in an ordinary-looking robe. He was eating in a restaurant, listening to people talking about a Vile-Emperor Dynasty celestial being kidnapped. Although he didn\u2019t react visibly, inside, he was bursting with excitement.</p><br/><p>He looked down to prevent his eyes from shining too brightly, and raised a jug of alcohol to his lips to keep himself from laughing out loud.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was the right thing to pay special attention to him all those years ago. I\u2019m waiting for you here in the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, Bai Xiaochun!\u201d That old man was none other than\u2026 the Grand Heavenmaster from Arch-Emperor City!</p><br/><p>Both because of his demigod cultivation base, and his profound ability to scheme and plot, he had managed to keep his identity secret, and was completely safe. From the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, he had been keeping his eye on both of the imperial dynasties that ruled the world.</p><br/><p>There were others throughout the Saint-Emperor Dynasty who, much like the Grand Heavenmaster, heard about what had occurred. For example, in another of the immortal domains, in a small county, was Zhou Yixing. Nowadays, he spent much of his time bowing and scraping. By relying on his skills in spirit enhancement, he had managed to build up a small accumulation of spirit stones in his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>After all, he wasn\u2019t the Grand Heavenmaster, and couldn\u2019t keep his identity a secret. Therefore, he had chosen to simply take advantage of the so-called benevolence of the people of the Saint-Emperor Dynasty to somehow earn a living.</p><br/><p>But now, the news he was hearing had him far more excited than the spirit stones he had saved up.</p><br/><p>\u201cMilord really knows how to live. If he hides, he hides, but when he makes a scene\u2026 he does something monumental!\u201d</p><br/><p>All of a sudden, Zhou Yixing couldn\u2019t wait to build a solid foundation for himself, and then eventually earn his own glory here in the Eternal Lands.</p><br/><p>\u201cNobody here can perform spirit enhancements\u2026. I'm going to become a person of virtue and prestige in this place. I'm going to become a grandmaster that nobody will ever dare to offend!\u201d Taking a deep breath, he strode forward with a bit more confidence, as though his new dream gave him the courage to stand a bit straighter.</p><br/><p>In another prefecture quite a distance away from Zhou Yixing was a luxurious courtyard residence. There stood Master God-Diviner, his hands clasped behind his back as he looked up into the sky, a dispirited expression on his face.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy am I always down on my luck\u2026?\u201d he thought. \u201cI can't believe that it was like this in the Wildlands\u2026 and here too! I wish I could be like you, Bai Xiaochun, and go around kidnapping celestials. I don\u2019t want this life of luxury\u2026.\u201d Even as he sighed regretfully, a flirtatious voice drifted out from the room behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing out there, honey?\u201d</p><br/><p>Master God-Diviner sighed. Although he looked frustrated, he was actually feeling quite pleased with himself as he turned and entered the room\u2026.</p><br/><p>The Heavenspan cultivators who had been teleported into the Saint-Emperor Dynasty had it better off than those who ended up in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty. In one of the immortal domains controlled by the latter, in a certain mountainous valley, Patriarch Spirit Stream and Li Qinghou were recovering from a recent battle. They were both weak and wounded, but their eyes shone with excitement.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s him for sure!\u201d Li Qinghou said, looking particularly stirred up. \u201cThat\u2019s my Xiaochun! Kidnapped Celestial Ghostmother from the Vile-Emperor Dynasty!\u201d</p><br/><p>Patriarch Spirit Stream began to laugh uproariously, and at long last, his eyes flickered with hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou head to the Saint-Emperor Dynasty, Qinghou,\u201d Patriarch Spirit Stream said, \u201cI\u2019ll take care of things here.\u201d However, even as he finished speaking, he began coughing, and blood oozed out of the corner of his mouth.</p><br/><p>Li Qinghou shook his head. Looking anxiously at Patriarch Spirit Stream, he said, \u201cXiaochun can take care of himself. He\u2019s doing this to give people hope! We need to hurry up and find as many people as we can!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWith Big Fatty Zhang to help me, I\u2019ll be fine,\u201d Patriarch Spirit Stream said, his eyes shining with determination. \u201cThe Vile-Emperor Dynasty people are definitely going to be worked up into a frenzy because of Xiaochun. Now is the perfect time to strike! I'm the patriarch of the River-Defying Sect! Even here in the Eternal Lands, that hasn\u2019t changed. Our home is gone, but our sect still lives on! It\u2019s my job to find all of our scattered disciples and bring them together!\u201d</p><br/><p>Somewhere else in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty, in a wilderness area, a bedraggled Song Que was fighting a desperate battle with a local cultivator. After getting the upper hand, he broke the man\u2019s neck, and then sagged in place, gasping for breath.</p><br/><p>Wiping some blood off his chin, he looked around at the corpses piled up around him, his murderous aura seething. When he thought about the news he had just learned from the group that now lay dead at his feet, he smiled. Of course, deep within that smile was a bit of a stubborn obstinance.</p><br/><p>\u201cWherever Bai Xiaochun goes, he always gets famous\u2026. The Blood Stream Sect, the River-Defying Sect, the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect, the Wildlands\u2026 and now here in the Eternal Lands. Even in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty! Well, I still have a chance to catch up. I can make my own place in this world!\u201d Song Que actually liked how things worked in the Vile-Emperor Dynasty. He enjoyed the fighting and the struggling, and liked how everything usually boiled down to a live-or-die battle!</p><br/><p>\u201cOther than people from the Heavenspan Realm\u2026 I\u2019ll kill anybody I see!\u201d Taking a deep breath, he prepared to move on, but before he did, he turned to look in a different direction.</p><br/><p>Off in the distance was a person he knew, the daughter of the Giant Ghost King and also Bai Xiaochun\u2019s Daoist partner, Mistress Red-Dust. Just like him, she had chosen the path of slaughter and struggle!</p><br/><p>As a deva, she had made even more of a scene than him, and had killed even more enemies.</p><br/><p>\u201cSooner or later, I\u2019ll be a deva too!\u201d Adjusting his black robe, he turned and sped off into the night.</p><br/><p>In the direction he had just looked, some distance away, was a temple to the Eternal Mother, located high in the wild mountains. Mistress Red-Dust sat there cross-legged, drinking a medicinal liquid that looked almost like blood. A handful of Vile-Emperor Dynasty cultivators surrounded her, kowtowing in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen the cultivators from the nearby city come, I could simply escape, and leave you all dead behind me. Or I could protect you. You know which choice to make.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm running low on life force elixir. Go get me some more immediately. If you can\u2019t find any, bring me life force from your apprentices!\u201d She spoke in a voice as cold as the coldest winter wind, causing the cultivators in her presence to shiver. After voicing their assent to her demands, they hurried away, eyes bloodshot. Their only hopes to stay alive rested in their ability to please this she-devil.</p><br/><p>The Vile-Emperor Dynasty was huge, and evil sects such as theirs existed everywhere. To have one wiped out wouldn\u2019t cause too many waves.</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s more of a villain than us!\u201d Her methods left even cultivators such as these nearly weeping.</p><br/><p>After they left, Mistress Red-Dust took a deep breath and then looked down at her belly. When she did, all of her coldness vanished, to be replaced by warmth and hope.</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where the hell that crappy dad of yours is now, but don't worry, mother will take good care of you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Out over the Eternal Sea, Bai Xiaochun sat on the bone lizard battleship. Suddenly, he sneezed.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs someone else cursing me now?\u201d Sighing, he looked over at Gongsun Wan\u2019er.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, are you saying that Big Fatty Zhang is in Vile-Emperor City, and that people are calling him Grandmaster Zhang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Gongsun Wan\u2019er said with a smile. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of detailed information in Ghostmother\u2019s memories about Big Fatty Zhang. After arriving in Vile-Emperor City and revealing his skills in spirit enhancement, he caused a huge stir. Even the Vile-Emperor was shaken. Back then, the Arch-Sovereign\u2019s body hadn\u2019t shattered, and therefore, Big Fatty Zhang quickly became extremely important. Supposedly, he actually performed a spirit enhancement on Vile-Emperor City itself.</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter the Arch-Sovereign's body shattered, the people of Heavenspan emerged into an abyss of suffering. But by that time, Big Fatty Zhang had already established himself and acquired a significant standing.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry about Hou Xiaomei. Ghostmother did indeed take her as an apprentice. For some reason, she showed particular talent when it came to the Dao of ghosts. In fact, Ghostmother began to groom her to accept the legacy of her unique Daoist magic. She really took a liking to her, so she definitely won\u2019t use her to threaten you.</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, you won\u2019t be able to see her any time soon. She\u2019s currently practicing secluded cultivation in Ghostmother\u2019s immortal's cave in Vile-Emperor City. She\u2019s preparing to break through to the Deva Realm!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

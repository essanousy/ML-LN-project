Snorting coldly, he sent the nine projections of himself down to the battlefield below.</p><br/><p>Wherever they went, they cut down their enemies with impunity. The Nascent Soul cultivators were especially targeted, and it only took a short time for roughly ten to be slaughtered.</p><br/><p>That was the limit of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s frigid domain when in the great circle of the Nascent Soul stage. He could create multiple powerful projections, but they could only last for so long.</p><br/><p>And yet, it had only taken a few short breaths of time for him to cut down more than a dozen Nascent Soul experts on the battlefield below, and also destroy Patriarch Dao River\u2019s fleshly body, leaving him fleeing in nascent divinity form.</p><br/><p>Everyone felt as shaken as if they had been struck by numerous bolts of lightning.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is impossible!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch, this\u2026 how\u2026 how could this be happening?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the level of his cultivation base? It only took a few breaths of time for him to cut down multiple Nascent Soul experts, and even defeat a deva!!\u201d The cultivators from the three sects were completely astonished, and were trembling in disbelieving fear. To see Bai Xiaochun handily defeat the deva patriarch from the Dao River Court, who then ran away like a stray dog, left them on the verge of collapsing mentally.</p><br/><p>That was especially true of the cultivators from the Dao River Court, who were the most terrified of all.</p><br/><p>In the past, Bai Xiaochun had marked all of the chosen from these three sects with turtle marks. Now, he had them shaking in terror, hardly able to believe what they were seeing\u2026. The fact that their patriarch had almost been killed, and fled in bedraggled fashion, proved that\u2026 Bai Xiaochun was now unimaginably powerful!</p><br/><p>The morale of the three sects\u2019 cultivators was dropping rapidly. In contrast, the cultivators of the River-Defying Sect began to cheer at the tops of their lungs.</p><br/><p>They simply couldn\u2019t control their excitement. The River-Defying Sect had been under great pressure for too long. For years, they had been bullied by the other three sects, even when disciples went out for training. The friction had become so bad that some disciples had been killed in the resulting conflicts.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the River-Defying Sect just wasn\u2019t strong enough. For the sake of the bigger picture, in the hopes of preventing things from escalating too quickly, and especially to avoid giving the three sects an excuse to attack, they had simply endured.</p><br/><p>But despite how they had endured, the three sects had managed to get tacit approval from the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect to exterminate the River-Defying Sect. And therefore, the hatred the River-Defying Sect disciples felt toward the three sects had reached an unimaginable degree. They simply couldn\u2019t exist under the same sky together.</p><br/><p>Now, a mighty deva patriarch had been beaten and sent running. It was so exciting that the River-Defying Sect disciples couldn\u2019t contain themselves. Most important was Bai Xiaochun. He was the spirit and heart of the River-Defying Sect; he had even come up with the name of the sect! He was their pride and joy, someone who truly deserved to be referred to as a consummate chosen!</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Grandfather Bai!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Grandfather Bai!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSect Grandfather Bai!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was hard to say who called it out first, but soon everyone in the River-Defying Sect was shouting the same thing, creating sound waves that rolled out in all directions.</p><br/><p>Song Junwan was completely swept up in the excitement. To see Bai Xiaochun standing right here in front of her was like a dream that caused tears of joy to well up in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Shangguan Tianyou said nothing. He looked exhausted, and had mixed emotions in his eyes. However, many years had passed, and he had changed. He was no longer the type to be easily excited.</p><br/><p>Beihan Lie\u2019s hands were clenched into fists as he glared hatefully at the disciples of the three sects. A corpse lay nearby, the corpse of a black dog\u2026. Shortly before Bai Xiaochun had arrived, that black dog had fought to the death to protect him.</p><br/><p>Within the sect headquarters, Patriarch Blood Stream was inside the Blood Ancestor, trembling with excitement. Even he had been despairing moments ago, but now, he suddenly found himself thinking about what Bai Xiaochun had looked like as Nightcrypt all those years ago on Middle Peak.</p><br/><p>The rabbit stood on the Blood Ancestor\u2019s head, looking at Bai Xiaochun, muttering in a voice too low for anyone to hear.</p><br/><p>Patriarch Spirit Stream, Zheng Yuandong, and the monkey were all looking at the hope of the sect!</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is the miracle I was talking about!\u201d the monkey murmured, his eyes shining with brilliant light.</p><br/><p>As the River-Defying Sect brimmed with excitement, Bai Xiaochun looked over at the destroyed fleshly body of Patriarch Dao River, and at his fleeing nascent divinity. Then he turned to look at Patriarchs Starry River and Polarity River, who were so shaken by the defeat of the other deva that they didn\u2019t dare to continue their advance.</p><br/><p>Because they were devas, and understood the Deva Realm well, they were more flustered than anyone else.</p><br/><p>They knew that although Patriarch Dao River had only been in the early Deva Realm, the techniques he used made him the strongest of all of them. And yet, he had been defeated within a few breaths of time by Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>They could tell that, were it not for the fact that the chaos of the battlefield prevented Bai Xiaochun from giving chase, Patriarch Dao River would have a hard time escaping with his life!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun could kill devas! It was a realization that shook the two remaining patriarchs to the core. Because devas could supplant heavenly will, the spiritual power they had access to, as well as their magical techniques and divine abilities, all contained the might of creation. They were like gods to all lower cultivators, and were beings that were virtually impossible to kill.</p><br/><p>Only someone who was also in the early Deva Realm would have a chance at beating someone like that. Furthermore, it would be difficult to end the fight with a kill. Therefore, what they had just seen play out in front of them seemed almost impossible. As Bai Xiaochun looked over at them, they both unleashed the power of their cultivation bases.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don't we stop fighting for today, Bai Xiaochun\u2026?\u201d Patriarch Starry River said.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe only made a move because the River-Defying Sect had no deva,\u201d Patriarch Polarity River added in. \u201cBut seeing that you do, well, I guess this was all a big misunderstanding\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Neither of them wanted to keep on fighting. The truth was that they weren\u2019t confident in being able to handle the terrifying Bai Xiaochun. Therefore, they both tried to play on his concern for the River-Defying Sect to end things.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t just think about yourself, Bai Xiaochun. You have to consider the other disciples of the River-Defying Sect. They\u2019ve been fighting for a long time as it is. There really isn\u2019t a need for any more fighting and killing\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Our three sects still have the advantage. If we keep going, it won\u2019t benefit the River-Defying Sect. Besides, your people are all exhausted. If they keep going now, there will surely be more injuries and deaths. You have to think of your fellow disciples!\u201d</p><br/><p>As Bai Xiaochun hovered there looking at them coldly, Patriarch Spirit Stream looked up from within the sect headquarters and shouted, \u201cIf we don\u2019t crush the enemy, how could things be over!? Can the blood of the River-Defying Sect be spilt so casually? This place\u2026 is not one they can blithely intrude upon, and then just waltz away!\u201d</p><br/><p>The eyes of the other disciples turned crimson, and they began to shout in rage.</p><br/><p>\u201cPatriarch, do something! We\u2019re all willing to keep fighting!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey invaded our River-Defying Sect, now they have to pay the price. In blood!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the shouting grew more intense, the army from the three sects began to tremble. At the moment, they had no desire to fight at all, and in fact, began to edge away.</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun saw what was happening, his killing intent began to burn with even more intensity. Then, rumbling sounds echoed out as he shot toward the two remaining devas. Although he wasn\u2019t a fan of killing, he knew that it was just as Patriarch Spirit Stream had said. These people had attacked the River-Defying Sect, and they had to pay the price!</p><br/><p>Taking the fleshly body away from one measly deva was not enough!</p><br/><p>Patriarchs Starry River and Polarity River felt their hearts pounding in their chests. Their faces fell as they realized\u2026 that they could not avoid this fight!</p><br/><p>Considering that, they took solace in the fact that, although they might not be able to defeat Bai Xiaochun if they fought him one-on-one, they could still join forces. Eyes flashing with determination, they unleashed their most powerful divine abilities!</p><br/><p>Heaven and earth shook violently as countless heavenly bodies materialized around Patriarch Starry River.</p><br/><p>As for Patriarch Polarity River, he knew he was facing a formidable opponent. A devilish will erupted around him as he summoned a massive devil projection with 1,000 arms!</p><br/><p>Then, both of them charged toward Bai Xiaochun in attack!</p><br/><p>A grand battle of devas was about to begin!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

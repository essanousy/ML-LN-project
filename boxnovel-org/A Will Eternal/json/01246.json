Therefore, that focus and will could only unleash a fraction of its original battle prowess.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, the Immortal World was now nothing but ruins. Therefore, the Worldly Daoist currently only possessed about twenty percent of his true strength!</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if my true self had come here years in the past, I still wouldn\u2019t have been able to remain in the presence of this corpse for long\u2026 nor could I have touched it!\u201d In fact, he didn\u2019t even dare to step onto the ship itself.</p><br/><p>If he did, he would most certainly be destroyed in body and soul!</p><br/><p>This corpse was so incredibly strong that it defied imagination. It had such an incredible level of power that it was astonishing to think how strong this person must have been when he was alive!</p><br/><p>That was what the Worldly Daoist\u2019s tenacious will was considering at the moment. Although there were still many things he didn\u2019t understand, one thing was for certain: he had settled one suspicion long held in his heart.</p><br/><p>The will of death that suffused the corpse allowed him to identify its Dao!</p><br/><p>It was the Dao of death, and also\u2026 a Dao of apocalyptic extermination!</p><br/><p>It was a Dao in which\u2026 in the very end, only one person existed, desolate, cold, and selfish to the extreme. It was a Dao in which success meant the destruction of the starry sky, the eradication of all life, and the end of all creation!</p><br/><p>As the surrounding corrosive mists ate away at the sovereign will which held Bai Xiaochun in its grip, it was possible to see countless evil ghosts flitting to and fro, just waiting to rip the flesh off of his bones and consume him entirely.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Dao of this unknown, supremely powerful entity\u2026 is also\u2026 the Mortal Renegade\u2019s Dao?\u201d The Worldly Daoist\u2019s questions were mostly answered after being able to see this corpse, and identify its Dao.</p><br/><p>\u201cYears ago, the Mortal Renegade entered this place, and should have died. Instead, he acquired some astonishing good fortune\u2026. It seems\u2026 he must have touched the corpse.\u201d The sovereign will that surrounded Bai Xiaochun\u2019s body was almost gone, which meant that he would soon be exposed to the cloudy mists.</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd yet\u2026 who could kill an expert as powerful as this?!\u201d The Worldly Daoist looked down quietly at the corpse for a moment longer, continuing to sense the towering will of death that it emanated. And yet, he could find no further answers. And he also knew\u2026 that he never would.</p><br/><p>The stream of tenacious focus that had occupied Bai Xiaochun's body was about to slip away into nothing.</p><br/><p>At that point, his thoughts would no longer exist. In the past, his divine soul and fleshly body had been killed, and right now, the only thing that had returned was a bit of his mind.</p><br/><p>Sighing, he turned and walked away from the ship, and out of the valley and its clouds\u2026.</p><br/><p>As he left, his voice echoed behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cMortal Renegade, are you\u2026 still you? If you are\u2026 then did you become the successor of the corpse in that ship\u2026?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy does it seem to me\u2026 that the corpse died, but his Dao lived on, and was reborn because of karma?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside the valley, Bai Xiaochi remained still, staring at the swirling clouds, waiting for the most important person in his existence to appear again. Mixed emotions filled his heart; on the one hand, he wanted to see his old master, the returned Worldly Daoist, Immortal Imperator. On the other hand, he didn\u2019t want to see Bai Xiaochun hurt because of it.</p><br/><p>The words the Worldly Daoist had spoken through Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mouth moments ago had softened his heart, but at the same time, had caused profound emotions to rise up in him.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t have to wait for long before a figure strode out of the clouds. At first, Bai Xiaochi couldn\u2019t quite see who it was, causing his heart to pound with anxiety.</p><br/><p>But soon, he could see clearly; it was none other than Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>\u201cMilord!\u201d Bai Xiaochi exclaimed, hurrying forward, nervous, unsure of whether this person was the Worldly Daoist or not.</p><br/><p>Upon emerging from the clouds, his eyes were closed, and he stood there quietly for a long time. Not daring to say anything, Bai Xiaochi simply stood there.</p><br/><p>Enough time passed for an incense stick to burn, and the sovereign will began to fade away. Only a tiny bit remained, although it still pulsed with domineering, supreme power!</p><br/><p>Winds still swirled through the area, and the void trembled. As far as Bai Xiaochi could remember, the aura he was sensing was exactly the same as that of his former master, the Worldly Daoist!</p><br/><p>Before Bai Xiaochi could do anything, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes opened. They seemed profoundly ancient, as though they were looking out from countless years into the past. It was almost as if he had been reborn!</p><br/><p>Also within that ancientness was grief for the loss of home, family, friends, and loved ones. It was a sorrow abundant in helplessness and confusion.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, Bai Xiaochi was absolutely certain that the person in front of him wasn\u2019t Bai Xiaochun, but rather, his former master. Excited, he dropped to his knees to kowtow, tears dripping down his nose onto the ground.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s hand reached out to tousle Bai Xiaochi\u2019s hair.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Xiao Chi,\u201d he said gently, \u201ccrying again, are we?\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>When he heard that, Bai Xiaochi started to weep, and crawled forward to hug Bai Xiaochun\u2019s leg, just the way a child would his father\u2019s.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t cry, Xiao Chi.\u201d A warm smile appeared on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face. \u201cYou\u2019ve done great, kid. I know it wasn\u2019t easy for you through the years\u2026. But you know, you could do better\u2026. Deep down, this Bai Xiaochun is a simple and honest person. A true warrior, bursting with righteousness. He is imposing, elegant, stately, and far more talented than me. It seems a rare hero has truly arisen, a rarely seen <em>chosen!\u201d</em> Somewhere in the middle of his speech, Bai Xiaochi stopped crying, seemingly a bit startled by the Worldly Daoist\u2019s assessment of Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>\u201cMilord, this Bai Xiaochun, he--\u201d Before Bai Xiaochi could go one, he was interrupted.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad he wasn\u2019t alive back in my day, otherwise I probably would never have become a sovereign. However, had he been there at that time, it\u2019s highly likely things would have ended differently!\u201d It was possible to see Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes flickering with reminiscence, and the grief about him was nearly palpable.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochi had been about to interject, but when he saw that level of sadness, he held back. However, he simply couldn\u2019t understand why the Immortal Imperator would have such an impression of Bai Xiaochun. Then he started to wonder if perhaps the Bai Xiaochun he had seen was simply the non-heroic version?</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to leave, but before I do, I have one final mission for you\u2026.\u201d Taking a deep breath, Bai Xiaochun cast a very serious gaze at Bai Xiaochi.</p><br/><p>The spirit automaton\u2019s face suddenly grew very earnest, as though he couldn\u2019t wait to hear what this new mission was.</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember my words: from now on, you must always obey Bai Xiaochun. Don\u2019t ever trick him! Listen carefully to everything he has to say, and do everything he asks. Whatever orders he gives you, you must view as importantly as if they came from me. When he asks you to do things, you do them, to the fullest extent possible. When he wants something, you help him get it. Trust him. Come to his aid when others bully him. Being with him is the greatest good fortune you could ever come across, Xiao Chi!</p><br/><p>\u201cAlso, do your best to make him happy, which will in turn make you happy! Rejoice with him, grieve with him. When he is not happy, join him in his sorrow. Very well, Xiao Chi. This is my last mission to you. Will you accept it!?\u201d By the time he finished speaking, his tone of voice was completely strict and somber.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochi was somewhat stunned, and if it weren\u2019t for the aura that he could clearly sense, he would suspect that these words hadn\u2019t actually been uttered by the Worldly Daoist.</p><br/><p>Looking at the serious glint in his master\u2019s eyes, he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cYes, sir!\u201d</p><br/><p>The serious look on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face vanished, to be replaced by pure warmth. Once again tousling Bai Xiaochi\u2019s hair, he offered a few more parting words of encouragement, then closed his eyes. Bai Xiaochi looked on, heart twinging with pain as he knew that this would be the last time he ever saw his master.</p><br/><p>After Bai Xiaochun closed his eyes, the tension built for a moment, only to be broken when Bai Xiaochun opened his eyes again.</p><br/><p>Seemingly a bit worried about Bai Xiaochi\u2019s sincerity, he said, \u201cAlthough I\u2019m leaving, I\u2019ll come back occasionally to look over you\u2026.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>As Bai Xiaochi looked on, stunned, Bai Xiaochun cleared his throat and closed his eyes again\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

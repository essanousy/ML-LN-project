He emerged from the stone turtle\u2019s left eye, whereupon the medallion shone with a soft light that protected him from the black waters of the moat.</p><br/><p>Before long he was out of the moat, and basking in the afternoon sunlight. Giant Ghost City was bustling like usual, with a good number of people about even on the streets near the moat.</p><br/><p>The splash of the water as he emerged attracted the attention of quite a few nearby soul cultivators, and as soon as they laid eyes on him, they realized where he must have just come from.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s from Devil Penitentiary....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDevil Penitentiary....\u201d</p><br/><p>Virtually all soul cultivators in Giant Ghost City were terrified of Devil Penitentiary, so as soon as they saw Bai Xiaochun, they lowered their voices and averted their gazes.</p><br/><p>There even happened to be some city guards on patrol nearby, and as soon as they saw him and realized who he was, they simply pretended to have not noticed him, and hurried away.</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, I never realized people from Devil Penitentiary have such a high standing!\u201d Although he had heard some rumors before about how people viewed Devil Penitentiary, to experience it firsthand as a prison guard was very different.</p><br/><p>\u201cI guess becoming a guard really was a good thing!\u201d Clearing his throat, he began to make his way down the street, simultaneously sending a message to Zhou Yixing to come meet up. Then he began to look around for somewhere to buy vengeful souls.</p><br/><p>Zhou Yixing actually wasn\u2019t very far away, but since flight was prohibited within the city limits, he was forced to hurry along on foot toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>As Bai Xiaochun waited for Zhou Yixing to find him, he walked along and took note of several shops that sold vengeful souls. Some were large and luxurious, while others were smaller and more specialized. However, after asking around a bit, he was saddened to find that all of the shops were running very low on supply. In fact, none of them were actually selling vengeful souls, only buying them.</p><br/><p>After checking seven or eight shops and finding that it was the same with all of them, Bai Xiaochun started to get nervous. After all, he had come out with the specific purpose of buying some souls.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why do all the shops that specialize in selling vengeful souls not even have any souls to sell?\u201d With that, he headed to another street, where he checked in with another seven or eight shops. To his shock, he found that it was the same with all of them.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Finally, in one of the larger shops, he grabbed a salesperson by the arm and asked, \u201cHow come none of you have any souls for sale? What\u2019s the deal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d the salesman replied with a glare. \u201cWe\u2019re out of stock! What are you grabbing me for? What, are you gonna try to take <em>my\u00a0</em>soul or something?\u201d</p><br/><p>This salesman had worked in Giant Ghost City for many years, and had come to have quite an eye for customers. He could tell by looking at Bai Xiaochun, and also from the way he asked his question, that he was a new arrival. Completely uninterested in dealing with a newcomer, the salesman gave him another glare and then prepared to rebuke him a bit more.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Irritated by the man\u2019s attitude, Bai Xiaochun thought about how the city guards had reacted upon seeing him fly out of the moat earlier, and quickly pulled out his Devil Penitentiary prison guard\u2019s command medallion.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you have the guts to say that again?!\u201d he asked angrily, holding the medallion right in front of the man\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>At first, the salesperson seemed irritated, but when he realized that a Devil Penitentiary command medallion was being flashed in his face, he gasped. Scalp tingling madly, he shivered, and then plastered a huge smile onto his face.</p><br/><p>Considering that he had been in Giant Ghost City for many years, he obviously knew that people from Devil Penitentiary were among those who should never be offended. Devil Penitentiary was a place that even ghosts and gods were afraid of. The guards there were known to be vicious fiends, not to mention the inquisitors, who were brutal and cruel to the extreme.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cPlease forgive me, exalted one! The truth is that none of the shops in Giant Ghost City have souls right now. We\u2019re completely sold out....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSold out?\u201d Bai Xiaochun said with a frown, his anger beginning to fade.</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. The three great clans have been hoarding souls recently, presumably because of the matter of the Hell-Emperor\u2019s successor.... If you have an urgent need, exalted one, we do have a few random souls here at the shop, just not very many.\u201d Clasping hands nervously, the salesman hurried behind the counter and into the back of the shop to gather a few of the random souls that were available. Clearly, he didn\u2019t want to offend this person from Devil Penitentiary, and just wanted him to be on his way as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow domineering!\u201d Bai Xiaochun thought. \u201cI can\u2019t believe they bought all the souls just because of some Hell-Emperor successor thing.\u201d Never could he have imagined that the as-yet distant matter of the Hell-Emperor\u2019s successor would already start to negatively influence him.</p><br/><p>Considering that flame conjuring would require more and more souls, the fact that Giant Ghost City was almost completely sold out could make things very troublesome.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat am I supposed to do now? The three great clans are way out of line here! I guess I should have cleaned out the Bai Clan even more than I did.\u201d Sighing, he realized he had to rest all of his hopes on Zhou Yixing, and whatever vengeful souls he had managed to get his hands on with the information Bai Xiaochun had sent him from the interrogated prisoners.</p><br/><p>Even as Bai Xiaochun was pondering the situation, the salesman returned from the back of the shop with a soulhoarding pagoda in hand. Bowing and scraping, he said, \u201cExalted one, here are about 100,000 souls. It's really everything we have left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun scanned the soulhoarding pagoda, and confirmed that it contained far from the amount he was looking for. However, it was better than nothing. Nodding his head, he was just about to pay for the souls when a bored-sounding voice echoed out from the entrance of the shop.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take those souls.\u201d Two young men strolled into the shop, dressed in expensive clothing that seemed to be woven from spirit silk. Their robes glittered like magical treasures, and if one looked closely enough, it would be possible to see designs on them indicating that they had received sevenfold spirit enhancements.</p><br/><p>In the Wildlands, spirit enhancements were more common, but the success rates were the same as back in the lands of Heavenspan. The higher the level of the spirit enhancement, the more likely it was that it would fail.</p><br/><p>A failure would lead to the complete destruction of the item and the ingredients, and that meant that any item which had numerous spirit enhancements represented heaven-defying good luck.</p><br/><p>Both of the young men were in the great circle of Foundation Establishment, and from their magical clothing, it was easy to tell that they were no ordinary cultivators. They were flanked by eight middle-aged soul cultivators, most of whom were in Foundation Establishment. However, two of them clearly had Core Formation cultivation bases!</p><br/><p>Considering that the entire group of eight carried themselves like servants, it made the two young men stand out in even more grand fashion.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun eyed the clothing on the two young men, and could hear the stifled gasps coming from the other people in the shop. A look appeared on the salesman\u2019s face that seemed even more polite than the look he had given Bai Xiaochun earlier. Rushing over, he said, \u201cWell met, Prince Chen, Prince Cai.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGive me those souls,\u201d said one of the young men, the one whom the salesman had addressed as Prince Cai. Although the young man had spoken in a relatively calm voice, from the look in his eye, he clearly viewed himself to be vastly superior to Bai Xiaochun. One of his servants immediately stepped forward with a bag of holding to take the soulhoarding pagoda.</p><br/><p>Of course, there was no way Bai Xiaochun would simply agree to that.</p><br/><p>\u201cSlow down, there,\u201d he said angrily. \u201c<em>I'm</em> buying those souls!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two young men looked at him coldly, and could quickly see that he had a Core Formation cultivation base. However, they didn't seem to care about that, nor did they notice that he was Bai Hao from the Bai Clan.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll pay double,\u201d Prince Cai said. With that, he and Prince Chen simply turned and walked out, clearly bored.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was already feeling quite humiliated, especially considering that the salesman had just glanced at him out of the corner of his eye, clearly delighted to be able to watch this scene play out. Anger rising, Bai Xiaochun took a step forward and loudly declared, \u201cI\u2019ll pay triple!\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside, Prince Cai didn\u2019t even turn around before replying, \u201cI\u2019ll pay ten times the original price!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>These two young men were direct bloodline clan members of the Chen and Cai Clan, and were responsible for coming to clear out the souls of the various shops in Giant Ghost City. Although 100,000 wasn\u2019t a very large number when it came to souls, their clan elders\u2019 instructions had been very clear. They had to get as many souls as possible!</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was getting angrier. To him, it felt as if someone had slapped him across the face with a pile of money! Just when he was about to continue speaking, his transmission jade slip in his bag of holding began to vibrate. After scanning it with some divine sense, he heard an anxious message from Zhou Yixing.</p><br/><p>\u201cMilord, I'm just east of the teleportation portal! Someone\u2019s trying to kill me and steal all the souls I got for you. Help!!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

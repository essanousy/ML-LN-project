Why Did You Stop Talking?</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>As Xuemei investigated Nightcrypt's background, a rumor began to spread through the Blood Stream Sect. Supposedly, after getting medicinal pills from Nightcrypt, the blood master of Corpse Peak had immediately gone into secluded meditation, and still hadn\u2019t emerged. However, powerful ripples had begun to emanate from Corpse Peak\u2019s Blood Master Temple.</p><br/><p>Quite a few people noticed those fluctuations, especially the blood masters from Lesser Marsh Peak and Nameless Peak. All three of the current blood masters were relatively evenly matched, but now it seemed as if the Corpse Peak blood master was experiencing a breakthrough.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t likely that he would reach Gold Core, but to Corpse Peak, a breakthrough in corpse refining techniques would lead to a rapid and significant increase in battle prowess.</p><br/><p>Because of that, the blood masters of Lesser Marsh Peak and Nameless Peak started to get nervous. A few days later, the grand elder of Lesser Marsh Peak shot through the air in a beam of light to appear outside of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s immortal's cave.</p><br/><p>He was a tall and well-built man, with a mighty look and a powerful aura of qi and blood. As a body refinement cultivator, he almost seemed like a mountain standing there, emanating powerful pressure. Even his voice was deep and resounding as he said, \u201cIt\u2019s me, Grand Elder Han Chundong of Lesser Marsh Peak. Junior Brother Nightcrypt, are you home?\u201d</p><br/><p>The blood trees outside Bai Xiaochun\u2019s immortal's cave were trembling, but didn\u2019t dare to flee. No matter how scared they were of outsiders, Nightcrypt was far more terrifying. All they could do was grit their teeth and remain in place, glaring at the Lesser Marsh Peak grand elder.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was currently meditating in his immortal's cave. He had been a bit surprised when he sensed the grand elder\u2019s arrival moments ago. However, he could already guess why he might be here. After a moment of silence, he waved his right hand, causing the cave door to open. Then he ordered the blood trees to clear a path.</p><br/><p>The Lesser Marsh Peak grand elder strode into the courtyard outside Bai Xiaochun\u2019s immortal's cave, even as Bai Xiaochun emerged. As soon as they saw each other, the grand elder laughed heartily and clasped hands in formal greeting.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt, the moment you stepped off of the Blood Precipice back then, I knew that you were destined for extraordinary things. It's too bad you chose to go to Middle Peak. I would have loved for you to have come to Lesser Marsh Peak.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun smiled, although considering that he was wearing the mask, it was a very sinister and cold smile. Clasping hands, he said, \u201cGrand elder, your presence brings honor to my humble dwelling. Please, come in!\u201d</p><br/><p>Abandoning any other formalities, the grand elder followed as Bai Xiaochun led the way into the immortal's cave. Once inside, they sat down across from each other, and the grand elder said, \u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt, you have an extraordinary cultivation base, and shocking latent talent. You prepared long and hard, and then made an incredible rise to the top. Middle Peak is truly blessed to have you, Junior Brother Nightcrypt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Bai Xiaochun was very pleased to hear such words, he maintained a somber expression, and didn\u2019t even respond to the grand elder's words.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven more amazing is that the patriarchs have taken a liking to you. There are virtually no limits to what you can accomplish in the future, Junior Brother Nightcrypt....\u201d The grand elder sighed, and then went on to talk about the war between the Profound and Pill Stream Sects, as well as various other Blood Stream Sect matters, both big and small. He also used a variety of different methods to heap praise upon Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>From his facial expression, Bai Xiaochun didn't seem to be very impressed, but he was actually savoring the moment. He felt very proud to be the subject of such flattery. Occasionally he nodded, occasionally he shook his head, and occasionally he laughed heartily.</p><br/><p>After about an hour passed, the grand elder apparently felt Bai Xiaochun had been sufficiently warmed up. He was just about to launch into the true reason for his visit, when he suddenly realized that Bai Xiaochun was looking at him with an encouraging gleam in his eyes. He hesitated for a moment, then launched into another round of praise.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt, you are a man of striking appearance and talent, like a mighty dragon among men....</p><br/><p>\u201cIn fact, you can count on one hand the number of people in the Blood Stream Sect who can compare to you in terms of reputation....\u201d After enough time had passed for an incense stick to burn, the grand elder's mouth was starting to dry up. At this point, he figured it was probably time to move on to more important matters. However, a quick look at Bai Xiaochun confirmed that he seemed to be completely immersed in the sensation of being praised.</p><br/><p>The grand elder hesitated for a moment. However, he had come here to ask for help, and therefore, he gritted his teeth and wracked his brain to come up with new methods of offering praise. Another hour passed, and the grand elder finally ran out of words. However, Bai Xiaochun seemed more caught up in the moment than ever.</p><br/><p>\u201cEee? Why did you stop talking?\u201d He looked over curiously at the grand elder.</p><br/><p>Lesser Marsh Peak\u2019s grand elder was taken aback, but he gritted his teeth and forced out a few more sentences. In the end, he sighed at the realization that Nightcrypt was profoundly enigmatic, and definitely could never be viewed as an ordinary cultivator. Finally, he clasped hands and bowed.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt, you are truly brilliant and stupendous. I deeply admire you. Truly. Since that\u2019s the case, I won\u2019t beat around the bush anymore. The reason I've come here today is because I'm simply incapable of allowing injustice in the world. Junior Brother Nightcrypt, your Dao of medicine is shocking. However, despite the fact that you concocted medicine for Corpse Peak, the conscienceless Corpse Peak cultivators not only refused to be thankful, they actually chose to hate you!\u201d</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun thought back to the things that had happened in the past, his expression turned grim, and he let out a cold harrumph.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe grand elder and blood master of Corpse Peak are the worst of them all,\u201d the grand elder continued, eyes smoldering with righteous indignation. \u201cYou actually went to concoct medicine for them personally, but they repaid you by venting their anger on you. Completely preposterous! However, you can rest at ease about the matter, Junior Brother Nightcrypt. The blood master of Lesser Marsh Peak has already petitioned to the sect to publically clear your name!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun shook his head and sighed. \u201cI offer you profound thanks, grand elder. And the same goes to the blood master. However, the matter has ended. Besides, I actually learned quite a bit from that event.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt, there\u2019s no need to be so polite. You reached Inverse Blood Ancestral Awakening, and are exceptionally talented in body refinement. You have a berserk ghost defense! You\u2019re like family to us on Lesser Marsh Peak!\u201d The grand elder laughed loudly. \u201cCorpse Peak doesn\u2019t know the difference between good and bad, so we might as well just ignore them. However, considering that we\u2019re basically family, how about this: Junior Brother Nightcrypt, why don\u2019t you concoct some spirit medicine for Lesser Marsh Peak? I guarantee that even if you destroy the mountain, the blood master and I won\u2019t even frown in response!\u201d The grand elder even slapped his chest to emphasize his honesty.</p><br/><p>\u201cUm....\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, feeling a bit hesitant.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Junior Brother Nightcrypt, I know the protocol.\u201d He pulled a bag of holding out from his robe and placed it down in front of Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>After picking it up and looking inside, Bai Xiaochun found a large quantity of medicinal plants and a sizeable collection of spirit stones. Feeling very pleased, he was about to agree, when suddenly his expression flickered. The grand elder of Lesser Marsh Peak also frowned, and the two of them looked out of the immortal's cave.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt, are you home? It\u2019s me, Grand Elder Geng Qiankun of Nameless Peak.\u201d The grand elder of Nameless Peak, the dwarf, was right outside. His expression was the same as ever, but inwardly he was very nervous. For quite some time, both he and the blood master of Nameless Peak had wavered back and forth about Bai Xiaochun\u2019s pill concocting.</p><br/><p>However, after hearing that the grand elder of Lesser Marsh Peak had shown upon on Middle Peak, they knew that they couldn\u2019t just sit around and do nothing. That was especially true of the Nameless Peak blood master. Therefore, he sent the grand elder hurrying over, worried the whole time about whether or not he could convince Nightcrypt to concoct medicine for Nameless Peak.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun blinked a few times, then rose to his feet and went out to receive the grand elder from Nameless Peak and lead him inside.</p><br/><p>As soon as the grand elder from Nameless Peak entered, he saw Han Chundong. When their eyes met, they blazed with a competitive flare.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt,\u201d the dwarf said, \u201cI'm not the kind of person to waste words. If you concoct a special tier-4 spirit medicine for Nameless Peak, then we will double whatever Lesser Marsh Peak has offered you. Our only condition is that you concoct medicine for us first!\u201d The dwarf spoke in a very domineering fashion. However, before Bai Xiaochun could respond, Han Chundong snorted and shot to his feet, radiating a murderous aura.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt, that bag of holding only contains the initial deposit! If you concoct medicine for us first, then we\u2019ll give you full access to our secret body refinement techniques. You can even cultivate the secret magic of Lesser Marsh Peak!\u201d The grand elder from Lesser Marsh Peak gritted his teeth. He wasn\u2019t sure how much free time Bai Xiaochun had, but he knew that it often took many days for him to concoct medicine. Considering that war was looming, he was desperate to get this medicine concocted.</p><br/><p>Because of that, he would do everything he could to make sure the blood master from his mountain peak was first in line.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was moved. The truth was that he did want to do some research into Lesser Marsh Peak\u2019s body refinement techniques. After all, they seemed connected to the Undying Codex.</p><br/><p>Off to the side, the dwarf seemed shocked by the other grand elder\u2019s words. However, as soon as he saw the expression on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s face, he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt, Nameless Peak has prepared a gargoyle just for you! We can teach you Nameless Peak\u2019s gargoyle refining magics!\u201d In response to his words, Han Chundong glared at him angrily.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was quivering in eagerness. The gargoyle magics of Nameless Peak were top secret, and cultivators from outside of that mountain peak had to spend a huge amount of merit points to study them.</p><br/><p>Their incredible value was difficult to put into words.</p><br/><p>Han Chundong looked at Bai Xiaochun and said, \u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt, the best rule to follow is <em>first come first served</em>. Lesser Marsh Peak was the first to come here to request medicine concocting, so please take that into careful consideration!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dwarf looked over and said, \u201cJunior Brother Nightcrypt, Nameless Peak is willing to double their offer!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun rubbed his forehead, then looked back and forth between the two. Chuckling, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s true. <em>First come first served</em> is the most fair. I\u2019ll start at Lesser Marsh Peak. I hope that grand elder and blood master from Nameless Peak won\u2019t take offense. Also, there\u2019s no need to offer double. I understand that both of you are here to represent your respective blood masters. How about this: I\u2019ll promise that no matter who I concoct medicine for, I\u2019ll get it done before the war starts. For both of you! I guarantee it!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two grand elders were visibly moved. The truth was that neither of them wanted to get into a bidding war. Seeing how smoothly Bai Xiaochun had handled the situation, the felt even better about him than before. Nodding, they proceeded to chat a bit longer before clasping hands and leaving.</p><br/><p>After seeing them off, Bai Xiaochun returned to his immortal's cave and sat down cross-legged. After a moment of thought, he chuckled to himself.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have the emerald zombie from Corpse Peak, and I've gotten the grand elder from Middle Peak to fall for me. If I get a gargoyle from Nameless Peak and cultivate body refinement on Lesser Marsh Peak, then I\u2019ll be more important in the Blood Stream Sect than ever. I\u2019ll be similar to a bloodstreak elder. By the time Song Junwan becomes blood master, I\u2019ll be far more likely to snag the spot of grand elder for myself!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

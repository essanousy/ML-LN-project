Scared me half to death.\u201d Bai Xiaochun flicked his sleeve in distaste. Although a special sealing mark was needed to get into those 27 special spell formations, he could simply do so with his Undying Hex....</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I can get through the Great Wall\u2019s spell formation, then there\u2019s no need to even mention some little teleportation formations.\u201d Sticking his chin up, he looked down at the dead Lu Shiyou and felt very proud of coming out on top in this battle of wits.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can only blame your lack of insight into my abilities!\u201d With that, he strutted out of the cell.</p><br/><p>Although the death of Lu Shiyou caused some complications, it wasn\u2019t anything the guards of Cellblock B couldn\u2019t take care of. After giving the deputy warden the information regarding the man\u2019s loot stash, the fact that he was dead didn\u2019t really matter.</p><br/><p>Of course, the guards weren\u2019t stupid. They realized that Bai Xiaochun must have uncovered some other secret, and had been forced to silence Lu Shiyou. However, when Bai Xiaochun proposed forgetting about the thirty percent cut that was owed to him, the guards felt much better.</p><br/><p>After all, the official rules allowed for the possibility of inquisitors coming across secret information. As long as the inquisitor was well-liked by everyone else, it usually wouldn\u2019t cause a problem.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s way of handling the situation not only forestalled any questions, but also left everyone involved feeling pleased. With a few parting words, Bai Xiaochun left and headed back to Cellblock D, in very high spirits. He even decided to contact Zhou Yixing. Earlier, Li Xu had put Devil Penitentiary on complete lockdown, and any attempts to communicate with the outside had been fruitless.</p><br/><p>But now, his communication went through. Bai Xiaochun quickly relayed a portion of the information about the spell formations, and told Zhou Yixing to go confirm its validity. The next day, he got word back.</p><br/><p>Zhou Yixing sounded completely incredulous as he said, \u201cThe spell formations were all there, milord!! Each and every location was really strange, and in fact, impossible to see into. Not even divine sense would work. In fact, I couldn\u2019t actually see any evidence of spell formations. If you hadn\u2019t told me of the exact locations, I would never have been able to find them.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>When Bai Xiaochun heard that, he breathed a sigh of relief, and then excitedly clenched his hands into fists.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo it really is true! Hahaha! With those teleportation formations, I have a much better chance of getting away!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe three great clans and the Giant Ghost King are currently at each other\u2019s throats... once the chaos breaks out, I definitely won\u2019t wait around for the Bai Clan to come looking for me. I\u2019ll get out of Devil Penitentiary and then make my way to freedom!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Bai Xiaochun began to wait patiently. Another half a month went by. Although there were many people in the city who knew that the rebellion was coming, when it actually happened, it still came as a shock!</p><br/><p>The first astonishing development occurred, not within the three great clans, but rather... in the form of a huge, illusory axe that appeared in the sky above Giant Ghost City!</p><br/><p>It was fully 30,000 meters tall, and radiated shocking energy. The instant it appeared, it sliced down through the air toward the huge giant ghost statue in the middle of the city.</p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds filled heaven and earth, and at the same time, a roar of rage erupted from the royal palace at the head of the statue.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow dare you, Nine Serenities King!!\u201d Even as the voice echoed out, the illusory image of a giant ghost appeared in the air, which snarled viciously as it unleashed a fist strike to meet the incoming axe!</p><br/><p>As the two bore down on each other, indescribable power rippled out in all directions, casting all creation into chaos and even ripping the air apart!!</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm only doing this to repay a debt, Giant Ghost King! You\u2019re on your own now.\u201d Laughter accompanied the axe as it descended, along with intense rumbling sounds. Then, the axe and the giant ghost met....</p><br/><p>Booming rumbles filled the air!</p><br/><p>A massive sound that surpassed heavenly thunder rippled out with the power to destroy the heavens and crush the earth. A huge shockwave spread out, crushing everything in its path and even ripping rifts open in the sky.</p><br/><p>Giant Ghost City was instantly thrown into chaos as countless people looked up to see what was happening. The sight that met their eyes was the shadowy incarnation of a giant ghost being completely destroyed by the huge axe!!</p><br/><p>\u201cTh-this... this....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! The Giant Ghost King... can\u2019t even fight back!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is impossible!!\u201d</p><br/><p>To the utter shock of countless onlookers, the huge axe ripped through the illusory giant ghost, and then proceeded onward toward Giant Ghost City. Thankfully, that was when a shimmering shield of light sprang up, which was none other than the city\u2019s grand spell formation.</p><br/><p>Next, an ear-splitting boom spread out, causing cracks to appear all over the spell formation shield. The shield held, and the axe faded away, but then, more laughter rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you really are in your decay period, Giant Ghost King! Well, whether or not you survive this calamity has nothing to with me. Farewell!\u201d The mad laughter then slowly faded away into nothing.</p><br/><p>Everyone who had witnessed this scene was completely shaken, and suddenly realized that... the rebellion was taking place on this very day!</p><br/><p>It was at that point that six beams of light suddenly shot into the air above the city. Within those beams of light were the six of the ten heavenly marquises that ruled Giant Ghost City. Those marquises each controlled one of the ten armies stationed in the city. As for the remaining four heavenly marquises, they did nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cToday is the day you meet your end, Giant Ghost King!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDie, Giant Ghost King!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Of the six heavenly marquises, none were devas, but some of them were half a step into the Deva Realm. Their combined attack on the royal palace instantly caused Giant Ghost City to tremble, and yet, that was when a roar of rage erupted from one of the statue\u2019s hands. Duke Deathcrier appeared, his expression grim as he released a shout as cold as midwinter snow, filled with the power of his deva cultivation base.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat gall!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>However, even as Duke Deathcrier flew out to intercept the six heavenly marquises, a sigh could be heard from the giant ghost statue\u2019s other hand.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Deathcrier,\u201d said a sad voice, \u201cI know we\u2019ve been friends for years, but... now we\u2019re enemies!\u201d A blurry figure suddenly appeared on the statue's other hand.</p><br/><p>It was none other than... one of Giant Ghost City\u2019s five dukes... Duke Netherworld!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re also betraying his highness the king, Netherworld?!?!\u201d Killing intent instantly appeared in Duke Deathcrier\u2019s eyes as he shifted targets.</p><br/><p>It was in this moment that the three great clans burst into action.</p><br/><p>Three shocking beams of light rose up into the air, which then shot toward the giant ghost statue. Within those beams of light were the three deva patriarchs of the three clans.</p><br/><p>The reason why the three patriarchs hadn\u2019t made a move until now was because they were waiting for the exploratory attack made by the Nine Serenities King. Now that they were convinced that the Giant Ghost King was weak, they were eager to attack.</p><br/><p>The three of them shot through the air at shocking speed, joining the six heavenly marquises to attack the royal palace!</p><br/><p>All of this was merely a prelude to the chaos to come. Of the ten marquises, six had turned traitor. Of the five dukes, four were rebelling. It was a situation the likes of which did not occur often in the Wildlands.</p><br/><p>In fact, it was an extremely rare development. That was especially true considering... they were fighting against a king! They were... trying to kill a demigod!!</p><br/><p>\u201cYour secret is out, Giant Ghost King! The technique you cultivate has a fatal flaw, and although we couldn\u2019t calculate the specific date of your decay period, it\u2019s now obvious that you\u2019re in the middle of it! It\u2019s time for you to die!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI've been waiting for this day for a long time, Giant Ghost King! Today, you will be killed beyond the shadow of a doubt!!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>The three deva patriarchs shot like sharp blades through the air, leaving streaks of light behind them as they slammed into the giant ghost statue.</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOMMM!</p><br/><p>The giant ghost statue simply couldn\u2019t withstand the force of the blow. Cracks spread out across its surface, and the royal palace began to collapse. As the rubble and dust spread out, a tall, muscular man appeared, wearing a violet robe embroidered with a serpentine dragon, and a kingly crown.</p><br/><p>He appeared to be middle-aged, and was somehow threatening without being angry. He also radiated an aura that was completely shocking. He was none other than... the Giant Ghost King!</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you\u2019ve finally made your move....\u201d he said as he floated up into the air, looking around at the three deva patriarchs and the six heavenly marquises. He didn\u2019t seem nervous at all, and in fact, was even smiling. Furthermore, that smile seemed to contain... a profound level of self-confidence!</p><br/><p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t sure exactly who among you would be joining this rebellion, so I was waiting for you to make the first move before wiping you out. Now, the moment has arrived\u2026 and unfortunately for you people, I'm not done playing my little game.\u201d From the Giant Ghost King\u2019s statement, it was obvious how confident he was, and it caused the three deva patriarchs\u2019 faces to flicker.</p><br/><p>However, there was no going back now. Gritting their teeth, they began to perform incantation gestures.</p><br/><p>\u201cWood Dimension: Killing Seal!!\u201d they roared in unison. Instantly, a huge vortex sprang into being, filled with countless souls!</p><br/><p>All of them were wood-type souls, and as they descended, they began to explode, creating something like a huge sealing mark that covered all of Giant Ghost City and filled it with the power of the element of wood!</p><br/><p>As soon as the energy rolling off of the Giant Ghost King encountered that wood-type power, it melted as quickly as a snowflake fallen into boiling water!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

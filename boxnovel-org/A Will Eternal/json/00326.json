It was now burned down into their minds, into their very souls, and would be there for all eternity!</p><br/><p>As the hand settled onto the surface of the ground, the rest of the arm shot out from beneath the surface of the water!</p><br/><p>The river surged with powerful waves that sent even the Profound Stream Division\u2019s 210,000-meter Heavenspan Battleship rocking back and forth. As for the Pill Stream Division\u2019s battleship, the patriarchs had to intervene to keep it stable.</p><br/><p>The minds of all onlookers were left blank as they stared at the enormous arm sticking up out of the Heavenspan River.</p><br/><p>Amidst the silence which prevailed, the two beams of light continued to shoot up into the sky. Intense rumbling sounds were accompanied by flashes of multi-colored light, as well as a powerful wind. Then, everyone could sense an indescribably powerful energy radiating out as the hand shoved down.</p><br/><p>Something like an island appeared in the middle of the Heavenspan River, which was actually a head that slowly rose up from the surface of the water!</p><br/><p>By now, even the 300,000-meter long Heavenspan Battleship was affected by the surging waves. All three of the huge battleships were being pushed away down the river, causing gasps to ring out among the onlookers.</p><br/><p>Even Gongsun Wan\u2019er\u2019s eyes were wide, and an extremely rare expression of shock could be seen on her face.</p><br/><p>Slowly, the head rose up, revealing two eyes that would leave anyone who saw them completely shaken to the core. Next, a nose became visible, and then the lips. Finally, a roar shot out from the mouth, a roar which could shake the heavens.</p><br/><p>The sounds filling heaven and earth exceeded thunder. The Blood Ancestor\u2019s hand continued to push down as, next, his neck was revealed!</p><br/><p>Before anyone could even react, the Heavenspan River virtually exploded, sending 300-meter-tall waves rolling out as another hand stretched out from the water and planted itself onto the opposite bank.</p><br/><p>The ground quaked as crevices opened up and portions of the land completely collapsed. Beneath the hand of the Blood Ancestor, the seemingly rock-hard earth became as soft as putty.</p><br/><p>Now that both hands were firmly planted, everything was cast into shadow as an unforgettably enormous figure slowly rose to a standing position above the Heavenspan River.</p><br/><p>The head, the neck, the shoulders, and the chest rose up to an unimaginable height. 300 meters. 3,000 meters. 30,000 meters. Soon, the portion of the Blood Ancestor which rose up above the river reached a height of tens upon tens of thousands of meters.</p><br/><p>His broad shoulders were almost as wide as the Heavenspan River itself. Every scrap of muscle on his body radiated terrifying pressure, and his waist was so narrow that it almost formed a triangle with his shoulders....</p><br/><p>Although everything beneath his waist was below the surface of the river, anyone who possessed the ability to do so would be able to see that the Blood Ancestor\u2019s feet were already planted on the river bottom!</p><br/><p>To cultivators, the Heavenspan River was profoundly deep, but to the Blood Ancestor, that was not the case!</p><br/><p>Although it was the Blood Ancestor who was standing up, Bai Xiaochun was now the Blood Ancestor\u2019s soul, and its entire body was under his control. As he looked out of the Blood Ancestor\u2019s eyes, heaven and earth seemed much smaller. To him, the mountains were nothing more than playthings, and the mighty river below him was like a stream.</p><br/><p>The mightiest of trees were like grass, and the cultivators were like tiny ants.</p><br/><p>The feeling was difficult to describe. As he lifted his gaze, he felt as if he could reach up and pluck the heavenly bodies out of the sky. His heart swelled, and after a moment, he couldn\u2019t help but throw his head back and let loose a long cry!</p><br/><p>That cry shook the highest heavens, and filled the entire continent. Birds and beasts trembled in terror, and the waters of the Heavenspan River surged. The huge golden crocodile which lay beneath its surface looked up, and even it appeared to be shaken.</p><br/><p>There were other enormous beasts who were similarly terrified, and left shaking.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood Ancestor!\u201d murmured founding patriarch Frigidsect. His scalp was tingling, and he was shaking visibly. Next to him, Li Zimo, Patriarch Ironwood, and the other patriarchs were similarly ashen-faced and incredulous.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it actually moved....\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNow <em>that\u00a0</em>is how to make an impression. The Blood Stream Division is going to use the body of the Blood Ancestor to move upriver!!\u201d Patriarch Crimsonsoul was struck speechless, and the other Nascent Soul Daoist masters from the Profound Stream Division were all completely taken aback.</p><br/><p>It was even more the case with the Pill Stream Division. All eyes were focused on that towering figure which blotted out even the sun!</p><br/><p>If even the patriarchs were reacting in such a way, there was little need to mention the Gold Core and Foundation Establishment experts. All cultivators from all four divisions were shaken and excited. Of course, most excited of all were the cultivators from the Blood Stream Division. All of them dropped to their knees to kowtow to the Blood Ancestor, calling out at the tops of their lungs.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Blood Ancestor!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGreetings, Blood Ancestor!!\u201d The words echoed out throughout the lands in shocking fashion!</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, aboard the Spirit Stream Division\u2019s Heavenspan Battleship, Gongsun Wan\u2019er was looking at the Blood Ancestor with a strange expression on her face. She seemed confused, and was frowning; apparently, she was trying to recall something, but was having trouble doing so.</p><br/><p>Then she saw the Blood Ancestor\u2019s eyes, and she felt as if she were looking at Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes. At that point, a mysterious light rose up in her own gaze.</p><br/><p>There was another woman who had a very strange expression on her face, an expression of both reverence and fear, as well as a level of incredulity that surpassed virtually everyone else present.</p><br/><p>That young woman was in the Pill Stream Division. She was so beautiful as to cause almost any male to lose control around her... Chen Manyao.</p><br/><p>There was another shadowy figure that no one else detected, not even Bai Xiaochun. In the moment that he took full control of the Blood Ancestor, that figure appeared high up in the sky.</p><br/><p>He wore a long black robe, and it was impossible to make out his facial features. However, he was clearly very old, and was permeated with an aura of death.</p><br/><p>He was looking at the Blood Ancestor with mixed emotions, including reminiscence.</p><br/><p>If Bai Xiaochun had been able to see him, he would have recognized him immediately. That old man was the same man he had run into in the nameless mountains, the person who had saved his life. The gravekeeper!!</p><br/><p>After a moment, the gravekeeper sighed, and then vanished without a trace....</p><br/><p>As the Blood Ancestor rose to his feet, massive amounts of Heavenspan River water flowed off of him, pouring down like rain toward the surface of the earth. The patriarchs gasped and immediately drove the water away from the cultivators of their various divisions. After all, that water was so powerful it could instantly melt many of the weaker cultivators upon contact.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun looked back down at the area around him. He was still not quite used to the new sensations he was feeling. However, after seeing that his disturbance of the Heavenspan River water hadn\u2019t hurt anyone, he breathed a sigh of relief. As of this moment, he realized that his own body was actively benefiting from having seized control of the Blood Ancestor, and was slowly growing more powerful.</p><br/><p>His Asura Body was improving!</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s too bad the Blood Ancestor is dead. I can control his body, but can\u2019t unleash the true power he was capable of in life. Even the fleshly body power I can unleash is only a small portion of his true potential.\u201d After taking some more time to analyze his connection to the Blood Ancestor, he had a better idea of the situation.</p><br/><p>Even the small portion of power he controlled was enough that a single fist strike on his part was more than a Nascent Soul patriarch could withstand!</p><br/><p>After a bit more contemplation, he sensed the thoughts and fluctuations of the other Blood Stream Division cultivators inside the Blood Ancestor. He could even sense the divine sense of arch-patriarch Master Godwind. With that, he stretched out the hand that had once been the headquarters of the Blood Stream Sect, and placed it back down onto the ground.</p><br/><p>When he spoke, his voice caused all the lands to shake.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlood Stream Division, to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>The excited Blood Stream Division disciples excitedly flew forward toward the opening in the hand. After they were all safely inside of the Blood Ancestor, Bai Xiaochun lifted the hand back up, and then pointed up the river.</p><br/><p>\u201cArmy of the River-Defying Sect, let us begin our march!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As his thunderous voice boomed, Bai Xiaochun sent one of the Blood Ancestor\u2019s legs forward, and he began to walk up the river!</p><br/><p>Spirit Stream Division founding patriarch Frigidsect took a deep breath and then waved his hand, sending the Spirit Stream Division into action. The 300,000-meter Heavenspan Battleship erupted with shocking power as it began to slice through the water after the Blood Ancestor.</p><br/><p>The Profound Stream Division and the Pill Stream Division similarly sent their battleships into motion. Soon, they were all following along, traveling up the Heavenspan River toward the Middle Reaches!</p><br/><p>The sun was beginning to set. A huge giant was in the lead, followed by three enormous battleships. As they proceeded up the river, the heavens shook and the lands quaked. It was a majestic sight!</p><br/><p>All beasts who inhabited the Heavenspan River were completely incapable of hindering their path, and did nothing but flee from them.</p><br/><p><em><strong>End of Book 2</strong></em></p><br/>\n</div>"}

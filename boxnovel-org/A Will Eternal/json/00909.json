What\u2019s going on?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Who did that? I was in the middle of cultivation, and nearly experienced energy deviation!!\u201d Countless angry curses filled the air, and dozens of cultivators actually flew up into the air angrily to determine what was happening.</p><br/><p>However, when they realized that the noise came from the blue rainbow, their eyes went wide with shock, and they flew back down to where they came from\u2026.</p><br/><p>The boom came when ten pill furnaces exploded, and startled Bai Xiaochun so badly that he immediately sent out some divine sense to see if anyone was going to come berate him. He even instinctively began to come up with an explanation.</p><br/><p>However, after a long moment passed\u2026 the clamor in the sect died down\u2026. Nobody came looking for him. The people who did fly up into the air only looked in his direction, then went back to where they had come from.</p><br/><p>Only at that point did he finally realize what was happening.</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! I was just being too jumpy, that\u2019s all. I forgot that nobody in the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect can tell me what to do!\u201d Feeling quite emboldened, he went back to concocting medicine.</p><br/><p>A few days later, another boom rocked the sect. To most disciples, an occasional explosion like that wasn\u2019t anything to get upset about.</p><br/><p>However, the booms continued every few days. On one particular day, there were eight in a row. Soon, the disciples on the rainbow were starting to go crazy.</p><br/><p>It only made sense for them to react in such a way. The sect was usually a quiet place, like a celestial paradise. But now, startling explosions were interrupting them all the time, making it almost impossible to focus on cultivation.</p><br/><p>Normally speaking, a person in the sect who did such a thing would be attacked and likely killed. But\u2026 the noise was coming from the blue rainbow. Soon, people began to ask around, and found that Patriarch Bai was concocting medicine.</p><br/><p>Therefore, nobody dared to complain openly.</p><br/><p>If the only thing they had to deal with were booms, it might have been possible to get used to the situation. But two days later, smoke began to drift out, smoke that caused tears to well up in the eyes of everyone it touched.</p><br/><p>\u201cAgggghhhhh! What kind of medicinal pill is Patriarch Bai concocting!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo. No! I can\u2019t take this!!\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just the ordinary disciples who were affected. Li Xiandao and Bai Zhentian were included, and yet, neither of them dared to interfere.</p><br/><p>If they couldn\u2019t do anything about what was happening, then there was no need to even mention the lower-ranking disciples. All they could do was stare up resentfully at the blue rainbow.</p><br/><p>Of course, Bai Xiaochun was too thoroughly engrossed in his work to have any idea that all of that was happening. His face was gaunt, but filled with excitement as he worked to make every type of pill he could think of that had something to do with life force. As he became more familiar with the various formulas, his skill in the Dao of medicine increased.</p><br/><p>He made all varieties of pills, and eventually started to get bored with life force pills. As his confidence grew, he came to the conclusion that he had turned over a new leaf in his pill concocting ability.</p><br/><p>\u201cI need to make\u2026 a treasured pill that can counteract the effects of the Aphrodisiac Pill!\u201d He had already been ensnared twice with Aphrodisiac Pills, and although he had to admit that he had actually enjoyed the results, it was still quite a loss of face.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmmphh. How ridiculous that other people would use my own medicinal pill against me! That won\u2019t do!</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm going to make a new pill that I\u2019ll call the\u2026 Turn Off Pill!\u201d The more he thought about it, the more pleased he was with the idea. Furthermore, the name of the pill couldn\u2019t have been better.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt's definitely a good name!\u201d Feeling supremely proud of himself, he started concocting!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know what\u2019s a real turn off? Those uncaring fruits! They\u2019re disgusting! Only by adding that type of fruit into the formula can I truly quench the fire which burns deep inside one\u2019s heart!\u201d Slowly but surely, a medicine formula was forming in his mind. After settling on an initial direction, he decided to run some tests. He started with thirty medicinal pills.</p><br/><p>He was so engrossed in his work that he forgot to eat or sleep, and watched over the pill furnaces constantly for three whole days. Soon, the pills inside the furnaces were beginning to form. Unfortunately, just as the process seemed on the verge of concluding, one of the pill furnaces suddenly showed signs of instability.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun quickly placed sealing marks on it, only to find that a second, a third, and a fourth furnace were similarly destabilizing. Before he could do anything about it, all thirty pill furnaces were teetering on the verge of exploding!</p><br/><p>\u201cNot good!\u201d Bai Xiaochun slapped down more sealing marks, and sent his divine sense out to try to keep any danger to a minimum. Actually, because there was no one in the sect who could tell him what to do, he had kindly decided that, as a sect patriarch, he should manage himself.</p><br/><p>However, when the pill furnaces exploded, a black smoke erupted out that not even he could control. It completely negated his divine sense! Thankfully, there wasn\u2019t much of the smoke, and all it did was cover part of the blue rainbow.</p><br/><p>One of the affected areas, though, was where the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Superstars trials were held\u2026. Quite a few disciples were there, and before any of them could react, the smoke had covered them.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun anxiously looked over to see what was going to happen. However, the smoke simply faded away, and the disciples looked around with quizzical expressions on their faces. As for Bai Xiaochun, he initially stared in shock, and then breathed a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait, nothing happened? Well, no harm no foul.\u201d Rubbing his nose a bit, he continued to watch until he was sure nothing bad had resulted. Then he started thinking about why he might have failed, and decided to try a different approach, this time with a hundred pill furnaces.</p><br/><p>Worried about the lower-ranking disciples who had been hit by the smoke, he sent his divine sense out and prepared to react protectively at the slightest sign of danger.</p><br/><p>Three more days passed, and soon, the second batch of pills was nearing completion. Up to this point, no unusual behavior had cropped up among the disciples from earlier.</p><br/><p>However, it was on the night of the third day that some strange things started to happen\u2026.</p><br/><p>The Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect was a huge sect with many disciples, so it was only natural for many of them to get together as Daoist partners. Among those disciples who had been at the Starry Sky Dao Polarity Sect trial, those who had no Daoist partners weren\u2019t affected at all, except that they were less interested in romantic relationships than before.</p><br/><p>However, those who did have Daoist partners, whether they were men or women, found that, as the sun set on their immortal's caves\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cJunior Sister, we\u2019re just not suited for each other. From now on, you do your thing, and I\u2019ll do mine. Let\u2019s break up!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cElder Brother, why are there so many good-looking people in the world, but so few interesting souls? From now on, stay away from me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm sorry, but we're just not meant for each other. My destiny is to pursue the great Dao! What\u2019s the point of romantic relationships? Don\u2019t even bring the subject up again!\u201d</p><br/><p>Quite a few people were taken aback by the breakup scenes going on. And of course, Bai Xiaochun noticed almost right away, and his heart began to pound.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait a second, that's not right!\u201d All of a sudden, he had a very bad feeling. After all, the primary ingredient in his Turn Off Pill was uncaring fruit. Using that in combination with some other medicinal plants he knew of, he had hoped to create a medicinal pill that would counteract the Aphrodisiac Pill. And Aphrodisiac Pills affected a person first physically, and then mentally.</p><br/><p>Therefore, his plan for the Turn Off Pill had been to affect a person mentally first, and after that, to cleanse them physically. The current situation went totally beyond what he had imagined would happen.</p><br/><p>And of course, it caused worry to gnaw at his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wanted a Turn Off Pill, not a Breakup Pill\u2026. I can\u2019t just let this happen. I have to do something!\u201d With that, he settled his mind. After all, considering that only a few people had been affected three days ago, the situation shouldn\u2019t be very hard to remedy.</p><br/><p>However, even as he made his decision about what to do, cracking sounds reached his ears, and his face fell as he looked at the one hundred pill furnaces, which had all reached the critical moment of the concocting process. Ten of those hundred pill furnaces had cracks spreading out over their surfaces.</p><br/><p>\u201cNoooo\u2026.\u201d he screamed, rushing forward to try to contain the situation\u2026.</p><br/><p>BOOOOOOOOOOM!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

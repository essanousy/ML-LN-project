The ground around Bai Xiaochun shattered, and many objects in the area exploded.</p><br/><p>Even Bai Xiaochun was badly shaken, and found himself staggering backward several steps from the force of the sound.</p><br/><p>His face flickered as he looked up and saw a young man flying through the air toward him. He had long, wild hair, and his eyes burned red with killing intent as he closed in.</p><br/><p>Although his speed couldn\u2019t be counted for much within the Gold Core stage, it was vastly beyond anything Foundation Establishment cultivators were capable of. The majestic sight caused Foundation Establishment cultivators from both sides of the conflict in the jungle to be completely shaken.</p><br/><p>Soon, alarmed cries could be heard. \u201cA Gold Core cultivator!!\u201d</p><br/><p>The River-Defying Sect had dispatched people to lock down all of the enemy Gold Core experts, to prevent them from attacking the Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><br/><p>And yet, for some unknown reason, a Gold Core cultivator had suddenly appeared right here, and was bearing down on Bai Xiaochun with murderous intentions. Some distance behind him was one of the River-Defying Sect\u2019s Gold Core cultivators, who was racing to block his path.</p><br/><p>However, even as the River-Defying Sect Gold Core elder was about to intercept the young man from the Sky River Court, the young man waved his hand, sending a green beam of light shooting backward. Moments later, a huge skybanyan treant emerged from the light!</p><br/><p>The skybanyan treant was the young man\u2019s battle weapon, something that he normally would care for just as much as his own life. However, after summoning the battle weapon, the young man cried out in a frantic voice, \u201cBuy me ten breaths of time, even if you have to pay for it with your life!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A tremor ran through the skybanyan treant, but it didn\u2019t hesitate for even a moment. Energy surging, it shot forward and blocked the Gold Core elder from the River-Defying Sect!</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s murderous aura surged sky-high as he shot toward Bai Xiaochun, his eyes so bloodshot they were almost bleeding. He had only been in the Gold Core stage for about half a year, but he was completely and utterly confident that he would only need ten breaths of time to kill a Foundation Establishment cultivator!</p><br/><p>The sight of the young woman\u2019s severed head tumbling off to the side moments ago had filled him with intense pain. She had been his Daoist partner, his Junior Sister, and he had already sworn an oath to himself that he would personally kill the one responsible for her death.</p><br/><p>\u201cDie!!\u201d he howled, smashing his hand toward Bai Xiaochun. The wave of his hand was backed by an early Gold Core cultivation base, causing a black palm to appear that screamed through the air toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>It radiated a terrifying aura that no Foundation Establishment cultivator could possibly stand up against, and even caused the air to distort as it sped along.</p><br/><p>In the face of such a murderous aura, Bai Xiaochun immediately began to fall back, his pupils constricting. A sense of deadly crisis overtook him, causing his flesh and blood to scream that he was in incredible danger!</p><br/><p>There was no time to contemplate the situation, and he knew that he couldn\u2019t rely on someone to intervene. Although people would come to rescue him eventually, he would have to hold out until that moment.</p><br/><p>There was only one thought running through his mind at the moment....</p><br/><p>\u201cI can't die here. If I want to stay alive, then I have to fight!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun sped backward rapidly, performing a double-handed incantation gesture that summoned three huge violet cauldrons, along with numerous spirit enhanced flying swords, all of which flew to block the enormous hand.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Those three cauldrons could be considered astonishingly powerful in the Foundation Establishment stage, but the hand summoned by the Gold Core young man completely destroyed them one after another. As for the spirit enhanced flying swords, as soon as the hand touched them, they began to fall apart.</p><br/><p>The hand destroyed them all like a hammer crushing ice cubes, then proceeded on toward Bai Xiaochun!</p><br/><p>Intense rumbling sounds could be heard. Blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mouth, and his entire body flickered with gold light as his Undying Skin erupted with power to defend against an early Gold Core attack. Although he was sent tumbling backward, he was not killed!</p><br/><p>The killing intent in the young man\u2019s eyes grew stronger. Without uttering a single word, he advanced, viciously waving his sleeve to summon a black wind. The black wind quickly transformed into a black dragon, which let out a powerful roar as it shot toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>There was no time for thought or planning. Roaring, Bai Xiaochun opened his Heavenspan Dharma Eye, causing violet light to erupt out. At the same time, his little wooden sword appeared, shining with the dazzling silver light that came from multiple spirit enhancements. Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t just defending himself, he was fighting back!</p><br/><p>When the power of the Heavenspan Dharma Eye locked onto the black dragon, the dragon roared and began to struggle. Although intense pain stabbed through the eye into Bai Xiaochun, he continued to unleash its power until the black dragon began to show signs of imminent destruction.</p><br/><p>Lips twisted into a sneer, the young man said, \u201cCan the light of a tiny firefly dare to contend with the glory of the shining moon?!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he advanced again. At the same time, rumbling sounds could be heard as the black dragon began to grow larger, sloughing off the effects of the Heavenspan Dharma eye. Bai Xiaochun coughed up some blood, and blood even began to ooze out of his third eye.</p><br/><p>The little wooden sword continued to speed through the air, and when it hit the black dragon, a booming sound could be heard. The Gold Core young man's eyes then went wide as he saw the sword pass completely through the dragon.</p><br/><p>However, it was merely a stab wound. The difference in cultivation base between Bai Xiaochun and the young man was too vast. Without even a pause, the black dragon roared and headed toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>The dragon hadn\u2019t even touched him, and yet his entire body was wracked with pain. Even his bones felt like they were creaking, and his qi and blood were in chaos. Madness began to rise up in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Off in the distance, he could see several beams of light racing urgently toward him; clearly, those were the patriarchs coming to rescue him....</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, they were too far off. If he couldn\u2019t continue to hang on for a little bit longer, the patriarchs wouldn\u2019t be able to help him. Although he feared death, he was also aware that such fear would do him no good right now!</p><br/><p>\u201cAsura Body!\u201d he roared. His Undying Gold Skin was operating at full power, causing golden light to shine out from him in all directions. At the same time, the manifestation of the second volume of the Undying Codex, the Asura Body, appeared. Instantly, his fleshly body power rocketed up as he prepared to face the incoming black dragon.</p><br/><p>A huge boom filled the air when the dragon slammed into his chest. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and the dragon collapsed into numerous strands of black mist. Bai Xiaochun\u2019s body trembled on the verge of collapse as he was thrown backward. Even as he did, a shout of rage could be heard from the young man, who burst through the remnants of the black dragon toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye, the young man\u2019s palm was bearing down on Bai Xiaochun\u2019s chest!</p><br/><p>In the moment before it struck, enraged shouts could be heard from the patriarchs. Heaven and earth shook violently, and the Gold Core youth began to tremble. However, he ignored everything around them, gritting his teeth as he shoved his palm forward.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re dead!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madness could be seen in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes as well. He knew that there was no way he could avoid this blow. Therefore, he raised his right hand, and black light shimmered from his thumb and index finger as he sent the Throat Crushing Grasp toward the young man!</p><br/><p>But then, rumbling echoed out as the young man grabbed Bai Xiaochun\u2019s right hand with his left and twisted it to the side. Cracking sounds could be heard as bones were broken, and pain surged through Bai Xiaochun. An expression of madness twisted his face; clearly, he was about to do something completely outrageous. Even as his right arm was wrenched to the side, and a palm strike was about to land on his chest, he used the Mountain Shaking Bash!</p><br/><p>It was a case of <em>even if I die, I'm going to make sure you feel some pain!</em></p><br/><p>Rumbling sounds could be heard as the Mountain Shaking Bash was unleashed, and Bai Xiaochun shot forward. He couldn\u2019t prevent his hand from being crushed, nor could he block the incoming palm strike. So, he chose to simply body-slam the Gold Core youth!</p><br/><p>Even as the destructive palm strike slammed into his chest, a black glow could be seen as the turtle-wok appeared to defend him. Blood sprayed out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mouth; he had been injured, but not killed!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s all you've got?!\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, smiling even as blood oozed out of his mouth. His vision was blurred, and he could barely move. Since that was the case, he decided that he might as well use what little energy he had left to force his nine spiritual seas to merge together!</p><br/><p>If he did that, he would reach the Gold Core stage!</p><br/><p>Normally, such an act would be preceded by much preparation, but as of this moment, Bai Xiaochun was going to attempt to force it to happen!</p><br/><p>As for his Gold Core opponent, after being hit by the Mountain Shaking Bash, he was flung backward, and coughed up a huge mouthful of blood. Then he looked over at Bai Xiaochun with complete disbelief and shock.</p><br/><p>\u201cA Foundation Establishment cultivator can actually hurt me? And that wok, it actually blocked my extermination strike?!\u201d The young man\u2019s killing intent grew stronger than ever when he realized that Bai Xiaochun was still not dead. Madness gleamed in his eyes, and he gritted his teeth. Despite the fact that people were only moments away from intervening and rescuing his target, he drew upon the full power of his Gold Core cultivation base and shot toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Considering that Bai Xiaochun was so grievously wounded, he was sure that one final attack would be enough to kill him!</p><br/><p>This was his last chance to kill Bai Xiaochun before he himself was killed!</p><br/><p>\u201cI might die, but you're going to die first!\u201d he roared, picking up speed!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

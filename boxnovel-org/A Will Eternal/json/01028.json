The mountains which were falling because of Daoist Heavenspan\u2019s magic transformed into ash.</p><br/><p>Deafening cracking sounds erupted out from the entire broken landmass, spreading out to fill the world.</p><br/><p>Crevices spread up and down the length of the parched Heavenspan River, stretching all the way to the Wildlands!</p><br/><p>Then the lands of the north began to tilt, sending a multitude of rocks and rubble crumbling down. The place where the northern lands of Heavenspan connected to the Wildlands broke, and then\u2026 began to rise high into the air.</p><br/><p>As this happened, everyone in the world was able to see it, and they gasped in shock. Despite how their life force was flowing away from them, this was still one of the most shocking images they had ever seen in their entire lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! What\u2026 what is that?!?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that\u2026 the northern Heavenspan region?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the landmass that was the northern Heavenspan region rose up, it began to shine with brilliant blue light. Anyone who looked closely would be able to see countless crevices appearing in the land, from which the blue light spilled. Simultaneously, any living beings who remained in the north vanished, taken away into the interior of the world treasure. As the moments passed, the earth and soil began to crumble and fall down, until\u2026 an enormous sword was revealed!</p><br/><p>This was\u2026 the world treasure, the Greatsword of the North!</p><br/><p>The bright blue greatsword cast its light throughout the dying world around it, and illuminated the crumbling sky, causing indescribable pressure to radiate out in all directions.</p><br/><p>Now that it had truly become a world treasure, it was possible to see a huge face on the surface of the sword. It was the Frigid Matriarch, clearly awake, her eyes shining with grief as she looked in the direction where the Blood Ancestor had burned to death. She appeared to be murmuring something in a voice that only she could hear. And then, a moment later, the enormous sword turned into a blue streak that shot toward\u2026 the Heavenspan Sea!</p><br/><p>Considering how large it was, it took only a brief movement for it to appear right above the sea. However, along the way, it shrank down rapidly until it was just large enough\u2026 for Bai Xiaochun to grab it by the hilt!</p><br/><p>As soon as Bai Xiaochun grabbed the world treasure of the north, his cultivation base surged, and he began to radiate unprecedented dignity. Eyes harsh and cold, he turned to the red vortex held by Daoist Heavenspan, and\u2026. violently slashed at it with his sword!!</p><br/><p><em>\u201cDIE!\u201d</em></p><br/><p>The sword became a glittering blue streak. At the same time, a projection of the full-sized sword appeared, rumbling directly toward Daoist Heavenspan.</p><br/><p>The sensation of deadly crisis that Daoist Heavenspan felt couldn\u2019t have been greater. Although he had been aware of the existence of the Greatsword of the North, he could never have imagined that it would be this powerful.</p><br/><p>He was still in the middle of trying to absorb the lives of everyone in the world, but now was not the time to worry about how the job wasn't finished. Without any hesitation, he sent the full power of his cultivation base into the vortex, causing it to rapidly increase in size.</p><br/><p>Battle prowess that was very close to the level of a true celestial raged as Daoist Heavenspan let out a shout. Then he thrust out his right hand, sending the vortex flying to meet the Greatsword of the North.</p><br/><p>Time seemed to slow down. The withering heavens, the wasting earth, the minds of all living things\u2026 they all slowed. Slowly but surely, the spinning vortex and the Greatsword of the North approached each other\u2026 and then made contact.</p><br/><p>Then, a massive, deafening, ear-splitting boom rang out, the volume of which surpassed anything that anyone had ever heard in all of history\u2026. The Greatsword of the North slashed into the vortex, sending out fluctuations that surpassed the quasi-celestial level, and reached the point of a true celestial!!</p><br/><p>If you likened this world to a paper model, then the fluctuations of the true Celestial Realm were like flames that would engulf it!</p><br/><p>The crumpled heavens couldn\u2019t sustain the force anymore, and a massive rift opened up. Then a second rift appeared, and a third. More and more appeared, until there were eight in total, ensuring that the sky above\u2026 had been torn into nine parts!!</p><br/><p>It was possible to see through those rifts into what lay beyond\u2026 a strange world\u2026.</p><br/><p>An aura that did not belong to the Heavenspan Realm then began to seep in through the rifts and spread about.</p><br/><p>As that was happening, the lands were equally shaken. Intense rumbling sounds filled the Heavenspan Realm, including the Wildlands, as the ground was ripped into ten parts.</p><br/><p>As of this moment, the Heavenspan Realm\u2026 had nine heavens and ten earths!</p><br/><p>The entire world was being torn to pieces!</p><br/><p>The living beings throughout the realm were trembling, their gazes blank as the world was destroyed around them. Indescribable terror filled them from the destructive fluctuations they felt.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, the Greatsword of the North finished slashing through the vortex, which was powerless to fight back, and in the end, exploded!</p><br/><p>When Daoist Heavenspan was hit by the devastating blow, it was like an enormous mountain had slammed into him. Blood sprayed out of his mouth, and his hair whipped about in wild fashion as he was flung away. Blue light was reflected in his eyes as he dodged to the side, and yet, his efforts couldn\u2019t prevent his right arm from disappearing in a haze of blood!</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible!!\u201d he screamed, blood splattering his lips and chin. He simply couldn\u2019t accept how powerful Bai Xiaochun was, and how majestic the Live Forever Lamp had been. Worse was that his top apprentice of years past had finished forging the Greatsword of the North, a fact that drove him into further madness.</p><br/><p>Although he had recently come to be certain that his top apprentice hadn\u2019t really died, and had also known of the supposed world treasure, he hadn\u2019t particularly cared. After all, he knew of one important fact. A demigod\u2026 could not unleash the full might of a world treasure!</p><br/><p>However, the shocking sword energy which had just been released was almost impossible to believe.</p><br/><p>\u201cImpossible. This is impossible!!\u201d Trembling in terror, he suddenly thought back to a point he had overlooked\u2026. Backing up, he said, \u201cThe laughing-crying ghost face\u2019s true form!! Dammit, it must have been him!!\u201d</p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiaochun, he was just as blood-spattered as Daoist Heavenspan. It didn\u2019t matter how strong his powers of regeneration were, they couldn\u2019t immediately heal him from the backlash of using the Greatsword of the North, which contained true celestial fluctuations.</p><br/><p>The injuries were inconsequential. Nor did he care that his consciousness was fading. He bit his tongue to maintain clarity, and then, bursting with killing intent and a murderous aura, hefted the Greatsword of the North and transformed into a bright beam of light that shot directly toward Daoist Heavenspan.</p><br/><p>\u201cTime to die, Daoist Heavenspan!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if the heavens were being destroyed and the earth was being decimated, his killing intent had not lessened.</p><br/><p>Daoist Heavenspan\u2019s anxiety skyrocketed as he saw Bai Xiaochun using every last bit of energy in this final attack. The blue beam of light which descended upon him was not the type he could fully avoid. Pupils constricting, he dodged to the side, only to have his left leg wiped out of existence.</p><br/><p>The pain caused a wild shriek to erupt from his lips, and yet the maddened Bai Xiaochun didn\u2019t slow down at all. Taking advantage of having gained the upper hand, he attacked again.</p><br/><p>The look in Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes made even the powerful Daoist Heavenspan shiver in fear.</p><br/><p>\u201cDu Lingfei isn\u2019t dead!\u201d he shouted in a thunderous voice. Although it was a shocking revelation to Bai Xiaochun, he was so maddened that he didn\u2019t slow down for even a moment.</p><br/><p>Seeing that his tactic had failed, Daoist Heavenspan gritted his teeth and self-detonated. Massive force erupted from his battered body, and a glowing ball emerged, a mass of magical symbols that almost looked like a seed. Moving with incredible speed, it shot away from Bai Xiaochun and headed up into the crumbling sky.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun wasn\u2019t willing to just let the Celestial destroy his own fleshly body for a burst of speed to escape. Coughing up blood, and his injuries worsening with every moment that passed, he shot off in pursuit. Unfortunately, Daoist Heavenspan achieved a final burst of speed\u2026 and massive rumbling sounds could be heard from the sky as the nine pieces which now made it up\u2026 crumbled into nothing!</p><br/><p>The heavens were destroyed!</p><br/><p>A massive shockwave spread out in all directions. Bai Xiaochun had been struggling just to keep his injuries in check, and was unable to evade the force. As it hit him, his mind began to spin, and he began to tumble through the air, completely out of control.</p><br/><p>Even as his consciousness began to fade, he jerked his eyes in the direction of Daoist Heavenspan, only to see him being overwhelmed by the shockwave. It was impossible to tell if he survived or died\u2026.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun wanted to see for himself, but couldn\u2019t control his own body. Slowly but surely, he began to lose consciousness. The last thing he saw was\u2026</p><br/><p>As the heavens were destroyed\u2026 a massive black hole sprang into being high above. Intense gravitational force erupted out, which rapidly transformed into teleportation power. That power descended into the Heavenspan Realm and reached out to all of the living beings within it. In the blink of an eye, they vanished, to reappear in random locations in the world beyond, although Bai Xiaochun had no way to know that.</p><br/><p>Everyone from the River-Defying Sect. Everyone from the Wildlands. Every person from the Heavenspan Realm was teleported away\u2026.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were completely bloodshot as the heavens were destroyed and the earth decimated. In his bitter blankness, he thought back to everything that had happened, and wondered if it was all real. It didn\u2019t seem like it.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy home\u2026 is no more\u2026.\u201d he murmured. The future seemed like a blank as he slowly descended toward unconsciousness. He fell through the air, and the light of teleportation wrapped around him\u2026. Then he vanished.</p><br/><p>In the last moment before he passed out, he heard a cacophony of voices ringing out from the world beyond the heavens. Some were excited. Some sounded greedy. Some seemed profoundly sinister.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt broke open! The Arch-Sovereign\u2019s body broke open!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHahaha! We've been waiting a long time for the people from that world to come out! Quick, notify the Vile-Emperor! The people of the Arch-Emperor Dynasty are going to be teleported to all sorts of random locations in the Eternal Lands! There\u2019s no time to waste! Enslave all of them!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! The Saint-Emperor is obviously going to covet the bloodline of the Arch-Emperor Dynasty, the sanctimonious bastard. But he won\u2019t be able to outdo us! Once our Vile-Emperor Dynasty enslaves everyone from the Arch-Emperor Dynasty, then the people of the Saint-Emperor Dynasty are done for! It's a good thing we went to war over the issue of setting up teleportation formations all over the body of the Arch-Sovereign!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf the three sovereigns, he was the last to blow! Sure took long enough! Originally, everything was supposed to be split three ways, but it\u2019s way too late for that now. The people from the Arch-Emperor\u2019s world are destined to be the slaves of the Vile-Emperor Dynasty!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFellow Daoists from the Arch-Emperor\u2019s world. We are from the Saint-Emperor Dynasty! We\u2019re here to help you! Join us in resisting the Vile-Emperor Dynasty! Remember, we are the Saint-Emperor Dynasty. Come look for us!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Saint-Emperor Dynasty is the only force in the Eternal Lands that can resist the Vile-Emperor Dynasty! Fellow Daoists from the world of the Arch-Emperor, and especially the reigning Arch-Emperor, you really have no choice! Join the Saint-Emperor Dynasty!!\u201d</p><br/><p>**</p><br/><p>In the Eternal Lands, there were five immortal domains, as well as a misty sea. Within that sea was an enormous, ancient statue, which seemed capable of propping up the very heavens. Suddenly, a massive boom erupted from that statue, to fill all of the Eternal Lands as\u2026.</p><br/><p>The statue collapsed!</p><br/><p><strong><em>End of book 6: The Strongest Deva</em></strong></p><br/>\n</div>"}

A moment later, he rose to his feet, his eyes blazing as he looked around at the crowd.</p><br/><p>Prince Ur-Demon and Reverend Devourer did the same. Their eyes were filled with boundless madness and hatred, to the point where it seemed likely that, if they found out who was responsible for their plight, they would unleash insane rage.</p><br/><p>The two months of torment they had experienced had frequently left them wishing they could die. At the same time, they had come to the conclusion that there was only one explanation for what had occurred: someone had been targeting them specifically.</p><br/><p>They weren\u2019t sure how the deed had been done, but they were sure someone was behind it.</p><br/><p>The shocked onlookers could see that something strange was going on, and began to consider what it might be. At the same time, Bai Xiaochun was feeling a bit guilty, and was marveling at how powerful these three must be to have endured what they had.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can't let them find out it was me. Otherwise they\u2019ll definitely go crazy.\u201d Having reached this point in his train of thought, he looked around quickly, and began to imitate the expressions on some of the other cultivators\u2019 faces.</p><br/><p>But then\u2026.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was definitely you, Bai Xiaochun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun whipped his head around to find Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a glaring at him with bright red eyes.</p><br/><p>His heart leaped with fear, but he simply frowned.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat exactly do you mean?!\u201d he said, slowly rising to his feet, and trying to look confused. Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a took a step forward, but Prince Ur-Demon quickly reached out to block his path.</p><br/><p>Prince Ur-Demon looked closely at Bai Xiaochun for a moment, then looked around at the crowd.</p><br/><p>\u201cLadies and gentlemen, presumably all of you experienced some strange situations in this trial by fire. For example, in the trial that only had nine stairs, there was a moment when one hundred stairs appeared. And in another, one puppet became ten, or even a hundred!</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you all. We three celestials joined forces to get past the eighteenth and nineteenth levels. But in the twentieth level, we faced an unending horde of minotaur monsters. That might have been something we could accept, but then we found that we couldn\u2019t perform teleportations. Fine, maybe we could accept that too. But after four hours passed, we were unable to leave. We were stuck in there all this time, up until a few moments ago!</p><br/><p>\u201cClearly, something very abnormal is going on, something that should never have happened!</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, anomalies are always possible, but there shouldn\u2019t have been more than one such strange occurrence!\u201d Everyone was shaken by what they were hearing, especially Gu Tianjun and Sima Yunhua.</p><br/><p>It was definitely true that a lot of strange things had occurred within the past few months. Although everyone had suspected something strange was going on, no one had any proof, nor any way to provide an explanation.</p><br/><p>Now that Prince Ur-Demon was speaking things aloud, people began to occasionally glance over at Bai Xiaochun, who simply blinked and tried to maintain a serious, suspicious expression on his face.</p><br/><p>As for Prince Ur-Demon, he was virtually staring at Bai Xiaochun the entire time, his eyes flickering with hatred.</p><br/><p>\u201cI suspect that someone in our midst somehow became the owner of the damaged fan. In fact, that person has likely already secretly passed the twentieth level!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is the only explanation, the only way that someone could target all of us, <em>and</em> keep us three celestials trapped in the twentieth level!\u201d</p><br/><p>As everyone looked on in stunned silence, Gu Tianjun shivered and suddenly said, \u201cThe person most likely to be responsible is Bai Xiaochun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t be certain if Fellow Daoist Bai is the one responsible,\u201d Sima Yunhua added coldly. \u201cHowever, it wasn\u2019t very long ago that Fellow Daoist Gu and I joined him in attempting to pass the eighteenth level. Once inside, the sand giants completely ignored him!\u201d At this point, many in the crowd began fanning out, as if to surround Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was very nervous, and knew that if he wasn\u2019t very careful, he could make a deadly mistake. Taking a deep breath, he tried to look furious as he shouted, \u201cThis is all because I'm from the Heavenspan Realm, isn\u2019t it? It's because I\u2019m the only celestial from the lands of Heavenspan!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two laid a deadly trap for me in the eighteenth level! And did you forget how the sand giants also ignored you, Sima Yunhua? It wasn\u2019t just me!</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for you, Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a, <em>you</em> were the one targeting <em>me</em>, from the very beginning! That makes me the perfect person to frame!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think I passed the twentieth level already!? Well everyone can see the standings, and look, I never got past the seventeenth level!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was just beginning to add some more when Reverend Devourer narrowed his eyes and cut in.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll all know very soon whether or not it was you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe time limit is almost up, and soon everyone will find out who the new owner of the fan is! Then everything will be made clear!\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone else in the crowd seemed to agree with Reverend Devourer.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was feeling very nervous, but couldn\u2019t think of anything to do. Not only was he surrounded here, but people would surely continue to be angry with him once they were back in the Saint Emperor Dynasty.</p><br/><p>He actually didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with the damaged fan now, but now that everyone had their divine sense back, his hands were tied.</p><br/><p>As Bai Xiaochun stood there nervously, Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a\u2019s eyes glittered with killing intent, and Sima Yunhua chuckled coldly. A moment later, the fan began to vibrate, and a force of expulsion appeared, pushing the group out of the main square of the damaged fan.</p><br/><p>As they were propelled in the direction of the Eternal Immortal Domains, the Saint-Emperor and the Vile-Emperor appeared. Although they were there to escort their people home, they also took advantage of the moment to try to get to the fan, which now seemed unprotected.</p><br/><p>However, it was in that very moment that the fan tipped to the side and then flew off of the hand of the enormous sovereign. Instead of heading toward any given person, it began to sail off into the darkness of the void.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun breathed a sigh of relief, but at the same time was a bit shocked. Based on everything that had happened, he had assumed the fan would come to him.</p><br/><p>Of course, he didn\u2019t let his surprise show.</p><br/><p>After all, the Vile-Emperor and Saint-Emperor were speeding off into the distance, using unknown techniques to try to reach the fan and enter it.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun was nervous, but because of the presence of the two emperors, and also how everyone was suspicious of him, he didn't dare to try to reach out and connect with the fan. Feeling very frustrated, he glanced at Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a, Prince Ur-Demon, and Reverend Devourer, and then settled his gaze onto Gu Tianjun and Sima Yunhua.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you people see that?!?!\u201d he said, almost shouting. \u201cFirst of all, I didn\u2019t perform any incantation gestures. Second of all, I didn\u2019t use any divine sense. Third of all, I didn\u2019t even move a muscle. That fan\u2026 didn't even move in my direction!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person who tampered with the trial by fire was obviously not me! And I clearly didn\u2019t get past the twentieth level, much less become the new owner of the fan!</p><br/><p>\u201cI met with the same misfortune as all of you. Obviously, I\u2019m not the one to blame!</p><br/><p>\u201cSomeone used you, Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a!!</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd you misjudged the situation, Prince Ur-Demon!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you, Reverend Devourer? Why haven\u2019t you said anything yet? And then there\u2019s you, Sima Yunhua. Things aren\u2019t settled between the two of us!\u201d</p><br/><p>His words were met with silence. None of the celestials could offer a single retort.</p><br/><p>Everyone looked in the direction of the disappearing fan. Although Bai Xiaochun hadn\u2019t directly mentioned either the Saint-Emperor or the Vile-Emperor, based on what he had said, and what was happening now\u2026 people had come to their own conclusions about the matter.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, there was no way to confirm the theory. Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a said nothing. He simply turned and left. Mixed emotions could be seen in Prince Ur-Demon\u2019s eyes, and Reverend Devourer\u2019s face was extremely grim as the two of them left.</p><br/><p>Sima Yunhua and Gu Tianjun exchanged a glance, then sighed inwardly. Shaking their heads, they left. Before long, everyone was taking advantage of the magical light left behind by the two emperors to return home to the dynastic capital cities in the Eternal Immortal Domains.</p><br/><p>After returning to Saint-Emperor City, Bai Xiaochun finally breathed a true sigh of relief. The crisis had passed. However, the matter of who controlled the fan had him feeling very anxious.</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come it didn\u2019t come to me? Is it because I didn\u2019t call out to it?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

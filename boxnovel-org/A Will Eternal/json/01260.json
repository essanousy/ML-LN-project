Right now, the only thing Bai Xiaochun could see was the bloodline sealing strip, which looked like dozens of mountain ranges lined up next to each other. In fact, it would have been difficult to even identify it were it not for the strong aura of the Arch-Ancestor\u2019s bloodline that it contained, which formed a resonance with him.</p><br/><p>Upon entering the sealing strip, his vision blurred for a moment. When it cleared, he looked around to find himself in a dark area that was actually\u2026 one of the Mortal Renegade\u2019s energy passageways!</p><br/><p>It was not a natural energy passageway, but rather, one that had been forcibly created back when the three Eternal Sons sealed the Mortal Renegade!</p><br/><p>It was large, almost like an entire world, but at the moment, it was completely and utterly silent. As soon as Bai Xiaochun took form inside, he began to glow with blood-colored light!</p><br/><p>As the light swirled around him, it became a spinning vortex with him at the center!</p><br/><p>The energy passageway was withered, but as soon as the blood-colored light touched it, it perked up. At the same time, the resonance he felt grew stronger, as though he were actually the foundation of the passageway!</p><br/><p>As of that moment, Bai Xiaochun realized what he had to do to restore the power of the sealing strip!</p><br/><p>\u201cI have to become the foundation of the seal. To repair it, I have to allow the power of my bloodline to awaken its strength. I need to go to the Mortal Renegade\u2019s dantian region\u2026. By the time I reach that point, the sealing strip will be completely repaired!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I perish along the way, the process will end in failure. And if I leave early, the result will be the same!\u201d Sighing, he knew that there was no backing out. He gritted his teeth and then began to fly through the energy passageway, sending blood-colored light shining out in all directions.</p><br/><p>The sooner he got to the dantian region, the sooner the sealing mark would be repaired. Therefore, he pushed forward with all the speed he could muster!</p><br/><p>The Saint-Emperor was doing the same thing in another energy passageway, speeding along and emanating light that represented the bloodline of the Saint-Ancestor.</p><br/><p>Back outside in the Eternal Immortal Domains, there were people who could see the sealing strips on the Mortal Renegade, and noticed the bright lights that had begun to move down them!</p><br/><p>At the same time, the struggling Mortal Renegade was already being forced to settle down into inactivity. Unfortunately, the process was not one that could be finished so quickly and smoothly; as Bai Xiaochun sped through the energy passageway, his eyes suddenly widened.</p><br/><p>The space up ahead of him had begun to twist and distort as several shadowy shapes materialized. There were cultivators and beasts alike, tens upon tens of thousands of them. None of them had any life force, only auras of death, and they all looked as vicious as could be imagined.</p><br/><p>When they laid eyes on Bai Xiaochun, it was as if they were seeing their greatest archenemy. Howling, they began to charge toward him in attack.</p><br/><p>Some were in the Nascent Soul stage, while others were on the same level as celestials, a whole cloud of powerful foes.</p><br/><p>However, none of them possessed archaean battle prowess. Therefore, Bai Xiaochun didn't even stop. Resorting to the Mountain Shaking Bash, he became like a shooting star that crushed everything in his path.</p><br/><p>Rumbling booms could be heard as he smashed through the shadowy specters, carving out a path through them in only the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>However, even after being destroyed, the shadowy specters formed back together, and stopped at nothing to try to block his path. If that were all there were to it, it might not be a big deal, but with every moment that passed, more specters appeared.</p><br/><p>Soon, there were too many to count, and even the mighty Bai Xiaochun was starting to slow down due to the time and effort needed to kill them.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit!\u201d he growled. Quickly performing an incantation gesture, he waved his finger to summon a Live Forever Lamp. As the power of his cultivation base then spread out, the surrounding specters also turned into Live Forever Lamps. As they burned, he burst forward in an attempt to pass them.</p><br/><p>As he tried to break through, the shadowy specters began to shout at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t escape, Mortal Renegade!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm gonna kill you, Mortal Renegade!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if I die, I\u2019ll make you pay, Mortal Renegade!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>At the same time, more and more specters appeared to bolster their numbers.</p><br/><p>By now, Bai Xiaochun could guess who these shadowy specters were. They were people the Mortal Renegade had killed in the past, and now that he was sealed, he couldn\u2019t do anything to prevent them from appearing. Although they didn\u2019t have the same battle prowess as when they were alive, they were still eternally indestructible.</p><br/><p>As more and more appeared, Bai Xiaochun\u2019s anxiety mounted. Unleashing the power of his archaean cultivation base, he summoned a tempest around him, then charged forward, mowing down anyone who got in his path.</p><br/><p>Occasionally he would use the Mountain Shaking Bash, and occasionally his Live Forever Lamp. Eventually, he performed an incantation gesture and unleashed his Sutra of the Former. Countless magical symbols appeared, sealing the shadowy specters!</p><br/><p>Unable to free themselves from the sea of magical symbols, the shadowy specters struggled in vain as Bai Xiaochun shot past them. Not looking back, he proceeded forward as quickly as possible.</p><br/><p>As he flew onward, he summoned hosts of lightning bolts which would instantly crush any shadowy specters he encountered.</p><br/><p>And thus, he made his way along the energy passageway.</p><br/><p>The Saint-Emperor had also encountered similar shadowy specters. His methods were different than Bai Xiaochun, but he was also a powerful archaean, and was able to maintain top speed. His moon sigil sent beams of moonlight out in front of him, carving a path as he proceeded along, shining with blood-colored light!</p><br/><p>Occasionally, he would summon lotus flowers, which would instantly crush the hosts of shadowy specters that surrounded him.</p><br/><p>The Saint-Emperor was not holding anything back. Now that the Vile-Emperor had been unmasked as a clone, and the huge sovereign was on the verge of waking up, he knew that a deadly crisis was brewing. Everything he had said to Bai Xiaochun had been completely and utterly true.</p><br/><p>Many eyes in the Eternal Immortal Domains were focused on the two sealing strips on the Mortal Renegade. Of course, the light representing the Saint-Emperor had been brighter to begin with, and was more-so now. And the Saint-Emperor was also much closer to the dantian region, being nearly halfway there!</p><br/><p>The sealing strip from the Arch-Ancestor had been reduced by eighty percent, and although Bai Xiaochun was successfully repairing it, it was still far behind the other one.</p><br/><p>Everyone was watching nervously, including the Grand Heavenmaster and other people who were close to Bai Xiaochun. Solemn, shaken expressions could be seen everywhere.</p><br/><p>This development had been too sudden, and yet, that was what had given Bai Xiaochun and the Saint-Emperor this one chance to repair the sealing strips. After all, if the imposter Vile-Emperor hadn\u2019t been killed, then his plan would have continued smoothly, and the Eternal Immortal Domains would have soon faced a deadly, apocalyptic catastrophe!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

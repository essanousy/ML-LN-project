As he closed in, he stretched out his left leg and tapped his big toe on Chen Yunshan. A deafening boom echoed out, as well as a miserable shriek from Chen Yunshan as he was sent flying. At the same time, golden strands appeared on the surface of his body, apparently some sort of restrictive spell that was boring into Chen Yunshan and sealing his flesh and blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou think a bit too much of yourself! One of my toes can send you flying!\u201d Bai Xiaochun\u2019s left shoe had exploded, revealing the fact that his big toe was flickering with golden light. Brushing off his robe, he produced a new shoe, put it on, then continued to flee.</p><br/><p>Behind him, the enraged cultivators of the Starry River Court helped the trembling Chen Yunshan to his feet. Even as he coughed up a mouthful of blood, he realized that his cultivation base had been sealed, making it completely impossible for him to use it at all. Eyes flaring with madness, he howled, \u201cFellow Daoists from the Starry River Court, set up the formation and kill this guy. Fellow Daoists from the Polarity River Court and Dao River Court, if we don\u2019t join forces and cut him down, how can we ever live down the humiliation of this day!?!?\u201d</p><br/><p>The cultivators of the Starry River Court exchanged glances and then nodded. Unleashing the power of their cultivation bases, they called upon the same stream of starlight they had used to deal with the defensive spells earlier, sending it shooting toward Bai Xiaochun with incredible speed.</p><br/><p>As that happened, the group from the Polarity River Court looked at each other, then howled, sending devil qi surging out to form a gigantic head.</p><br/><p>The vicious-looking head let out a fierce howl, causing intense pressure to weigh down all around it as it shot after Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>The cultivators from the Dao River Court weren\u2019t any more willing to let the situation drop. If they did, they could only imagine what would happen upon returning to their sect: they wouldn\u2019t even be able to look anyone else in the eye! Moments later, intense rumbling sounds echoed out as the illusory giant appeared again.</p><br/><p>Howling, the giant began to charge toward Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>From a distance, it was possible to see a stream of starlight, a gigantic head, and an enormous giant, all three of them deadly divine abilities, closing in on Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s scalp was tingling so hard it felt like it might explode.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys are really serious, aren\u2019t you?! I can\u2019t believe... you\u2019re actually using spell formations against me!!\u201d By this point, his Undying Live Forever Technique was in full operation, and he was flying along as fast as his Heaven-Dao Gold Core could push him.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the combined divine abilities of the three sects were even faster than that. Moments later, intense rumbling sounds could be heard as the stream of starlight appeared in front of him.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun trembled, and blood oozed out of the corners of his mouth. Before he could do anything else, though, the huge head closed in, spitting out a blast of frigid devil qi that surrounded him, making it almost impossible to move, and freezing the blood that spilled out of his mouth. Before he could recover, the giant unleashed a fist strike onto him.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>Frozen blood shot out of Bai Xiaochun\u2019s mouth as he was flung backward, his hair in wild disarray and his eyes completely bloodshot. As he flew through the air, he slapped his bag of holding, producing a fistful of medicinal pills with he hurled into the air behind him.</p><br/><p>Those medicinal pills contained all sorts of strange properties, and as soon as they exploded, they immediately caused problems for all the pursuing cultivators. Bai Xiaochun continued to flee, so nervous that he was bordering on madness.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Why hasn\u2019t the teleportation started!? Patriarchs, I'm about to lose my poor little life!!\u201d Tears welled up in his eyes as he watched the cultivators of the three sects building up another volley of divine abilities.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you scared of?\u201d the little turtle said disdainfully. \u201cI'm still here! Just throw me at them. They\u2019re just using some lame Dharma Idols and magical projections, that\u2019s all. Lord Turtle has destroyed so many of those kinds of things that he can\u2019t even remember how many.\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun threw his head back and roared, \u201cYou people push things too far!!\u201d</p><br/><p>A murderous aura erupted out from him as he reached his hand back and then hurled the little turtle out as hard as he could.</p><br/><p>BOOM!</p><br/><p>The little turtle instantly appeared in front of the Dao River Court\u2019s giant, which could do nothing to stop him. In the blink of an eye, he had pierced through the giant and was heading toward the Dao River Court cultivators who were operating it.</p><br/><p>This time, the little turtle struck a female disciple. She was the type of person who radiated an extraordinary air, and despite her killing aura, she was quite beautiful. But then, an enormous smacking sound rang out as the little turtle hit her right in the middle of the face.</p><br/><p>Tears leaked out of her eyes from the pain, and she let out an agonized shriek. Then, she realized that everyone was looking over at her with odd looks on their faces. Heart pounding, she pulled a mirror out of her bag of holding, and when she looked at herself, she screamed in bloodcurdling fashion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI'm gonna kill you, Bai Xiaochun!!!\u201d she raved, her hair flying about in disarray. Without any hesitation, she shot after Bai Xiaochun as fast as she could. Unfortunately, he was far too quick and agile.</p><br/><p>The young woman\u2019s impulsive action instantly affected the other cultivators who were operating the giant.</p><br/><p>As for Bai Xiaochun, considering how effective this tactic was, he quickly grabbed the little turtle and threw him out again.</p><br/><p>RUUUUUUUUUUMBLE!</p><br/><p>Then, Bai Xiaochun went crazy, constantly tossing out the little turtle to fight back against the magical techniques and divine abilities.</p><br/><p>Before long, more than half of his pursuers had little turtle marks on their faces, chests, waists, stomachs, and even some... on their rear ends.</p><br/><p>The mark of the little turtle was actually a very terrifying thing; even if he hit their clothing, the mark would pass through and end up on their skin. The marks even glowed, as if they were worried that people might not notice them.</p><br/><p>Not even thick clothes or powerful magical defenses were capable of stopping the little turtle marks from glowing brightly. There was one young female disciple who got hit on the chest, and nearly collapsed when everyone looked over to see her and the glowing turtle mark there....</p><br/><p>People used all sorts of defensive magical items when the little turtle closed in, but they were all useless. The terrifying little turtle was causing everyone in the battle to go crazy.</p><br/><p>The divine abilities and magical techniques they were unleashing were influenced by their surging emotions, or perhaps by the turtle marks. In any case, they eventually just faded away.</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s too many of you for me to beat in a fight, but I can sure embarrass you guys to death!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was shocked, and initially felt that the little turtle was being too vicious. However, as soon as he thought about how these people were trying to kill him, he angrily yelled, \u201cLittle turtle, are you sure those marks of yours can\u2019t be erased?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon't worry,\u201d the little turtle said proudly, \u201cnot even a demigod could erase them!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, Bai Xiaochun glanced back at the cultivators who had no marks on them, seemingly itching to get at them.</p><br/><p>\u201cGreat! They were the ones who pushed things too far, so they can\u2019t blame me for this!\u201d Gritting his teeth, he hurled the little turtle out again, sending him flying toward one of the unstruck cultivators.</p><br/><p>Those unmarked cultivators were currently hesitating a bit. However, they had convinced themselves that the marks couldn\u2019t possibly be indelible. In their minds, they would certainly be able to find a way to deal with them after returning to the sect. Even if they couldn\u2019t, surely someone from the elder generation would be able to help them. Therefore, it was with burning rage that they continued to chase after Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Booms rang out continuously as all of them were branded with the mark of the little turtle. Furthermore, all of their powerful divine abilities and magical techniques were faltering. The stream of starlight collapsed, followed by the huge head. Then the Dao River Court\u2019s giant fell into pieces.</p><br/><p>The only thing chasing Bai Xiaochun now was a mob of enraged cultivators, all of whom had turtle marks on them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI swear to the heavens, I'm gonna kill you, Bai Xiaochun!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! If I don\u2019t kill you today, I'm not surnamed Liu!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s powerful fleshly body was being pushed to its limit. He was coughing up blood and covered with wounds, and yet, his counterattacks were incisive and penetrating.</p><br/><p>Whether it was his own attacks, or the little turtle marks, he had pushed everyone to the absolute limits of fury.</p><br/><p>Thankfully, it was in that moment that teleportation power began to fill the legacy zone.</p><br/><p>Beams of teleportation light began to rise up, and the mob of pursuers suddenly stopped in place. If they didn\u2019t enter those teleportation lights before the time limit was reached, they would lose their chance to leave, and not even their sects would be able to do anything to save them. As of this moment, they had to abandon any hopes of killing Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>Having been forced to give up, they stared at Bai Xiaochun with such murderous glares that it seemed they were trying to cut him to pieces with their eyes.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun breathed a huge sigh of relief as he leaped into one of the teleportation lights. Looking over his shoulder, it was with great pride that he looked at the little turtle marks glittering on all of his opponents.</p><br/><p>\u201cHmph! You guys are the ones who pissed me off! When I attack, I frighten even myself!\u201d</p><br/><p>The little turtle looked at the crowd of enemies and seemed completely satisfied. He even appeared to be sighing. From the look of it, he was more proud of himself than Bai Xiaochun was.</p><br/><p>--</p><br/><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Deathblade.<strong> Chinese language consultant:</strong> ASI a.k.a.

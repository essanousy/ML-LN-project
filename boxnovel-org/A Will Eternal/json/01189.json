The fact that he had no idea whether the two of them were even alive caused a fire to begin to burn hot within his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiaochun,\u201d Patriarch Spirit Stream said, \u201cit seems likely the Vile-Prince has his eye on your physical body. Since he failed in his attempt to get it, he came up with two plans. One was to extract our blood, the other was to seize Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo, and use your unborn children to harvest both their blood and vital yang energy. It's all for the purposes of extracting the secrets locked within your bloodline!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun\u2019s eyes were crimson as he threw his head back and let out a heaven-shaking, earth-shattering roar. Suddenly, he was filled with a reckless rage that surpassed anything from before!</p><br/><p>These were his Daoist partners and his children!!</p><br/><p>The fact that the Vile-Prince wanted to use them for such nefarious purposes was pushing Bai Xiaochun into an insane level of rage, the type that could stain all creation with blood!</p><br/><p>Even the most fearful and cowardly person would be unable to accept such a situation, and would be driven into a violent rage!!</p><br/><p>However, he had not completely lost all sense of reason. He knew that if he went to save Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo, he might not come out of the situation alive. He had feared death his entire life, and usually chose to take the safe route, not the dangerous one.</p><br/><p>But right now\u2026 he didn\u2019t care. Even if he faced mountains of daggers and seas of flames, he would still go. He <em>had</em> to go. Even if he died!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal about dying anyway!!\u201d Such sentiments had never existed within Bai Xiaochun\u2019s heart before, but right now, they dominated his mind!</p><br/><p>Despite his frenzied state, he looked over at the tens of thousands of Heavenspan Realm cultivators, aware that if he left them here alone, they would be in danger. And if he took them with him in the Greatsword of the North, and he ended up perishing, then they would meet the same fate. Although he might be willing to throw his life away, he couldn\u2019t force the same fate on them.</p><br/><p>He had few options. Without any hesitation, he performed an incantation gesture and pointed out at the sword. It vibrated, and then released a gravitational force that grabbed all of the Heavenspan Realm cultivators, even Li Qinghou and Patriarch Spirit Stream, and sucked them inside!</p><br/><p>Next, Bai Xiaochun waved his hand, sending the Greatsword of the North streaking off into the distance in a beam of light. He had thought of sending them to the damaged fan. But he knew that, despite being the owner of the fan, he couldn\u2019t send that many people into it.</p><br/><p>\u201cGongsun Wan\u2019er, I, Bai Xiaochun\u2026 beg that you do me a favor. Take my people, and this sword, and deliver them\u2026 to the Grand Heavenmaster!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Some distance away, Gongsun Wan\u2019er materialized out of thin air, mixed emotions visible on her face. She had come much earlier, and had been considering whether to help Bai Xiaochun or not. In the end, she didn\u2019t need to.</p><br/><p>The fact that he had spoken her name aloud indicated that he knew she had come. Even as she watched in silence, he turned and became a blur of light, shooting back toward Vile-Emperor City like a meteor!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2026 trusts me that much\u2026?\u201d she thought. Turning, she blurred into motion as she went after the Greatsword of the North. She knew that Bai Xiaochun was entrusting her with the lives of tens of thousands of his people. And she also knew that she couldn\u2019t stop him from doing what he was setting out to do. It all left her feeling very shaken.</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, Bai Xiaochun moved with shocking speed toward the bone dragon that was Vile-Emperor City.</p><br/><p>Getting rid of the Greatsword of the North reduced his battle prowess to a certain degree, but he knew that he had no other choice. It was the only way to keep the people who had called him the Arch-Ancestor safe. It was the only way\u2026 to be able to fight a bloody battle to the death without any distractions!</p><br/><p>\u201cIf I don\u2019t kill you this day, Vile-Prince, then I don\u2019t deserve to call myself human!!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>Die. DIE! DIE!!!\u00a0</em></p><br/><p>The murderous aura which surrounded Bai Xiaochun propelled him forward like a destructive shooting star.</p><br/><p>The wind screamed and the lands quaked. The air, unable to sustain such force, cracked and shattered. The cultivators in Vile-Emperor City who could see what was happening were absolutely shocked, and felt like they were being crushed by the pressure. They even felt the Willpower inside of them stirring!</p><br/><p>Devas, demigods, and celestials all gasped in shock, especially those in the embassy.</p><br/><p>All of Vile-Emperor City seemed cloaked with a suffocating pressure as countless eyes looked at Bai Xiaochun streaking through the air!</p><br/><p>As for his destination, it was very obvious. He was heading to\u2026 Vile-Prince Mansion!!</p><br/><p>He looked like a vicious blade slicing through the air toward the Vile-Prince!</p><br/><p>Within Vile-Prince Mansion, all of the Vile-Prince\u2019s subordinates were shaking in fear. Meanwhile, the Vile-Prince was in a private chamber, a crazed expression on his face as he looked at the spell formation set up in front of him.</p><br/><p>\u201cLet's see how long you can last, you puny animals!\u201d</p><br/><p>The spell formation resembled a yin-yang symbol, with Song Junwan and Zhou Zimo sealed within it, their eyes closed. Both of them were trembling, their faces ashen and twisted by expressions of pain. Black smoke curled around them, stabbing into them to extract the blood and essences of both them and their unborn children!</p><br/><p>Thankfully, Song Junwan had a totemic tattoo on her forearm, which surrounded both her and Zhou Zimo with a violet, protective shield of light. Closer inspection would reveal that the totem tattoo depicted\u2026 Bruiser!</p><br/><p>The spell formation was set up on a blood-colored altar, which was none other than the source of the black smoke.</p><br/><p>In response to the incantation gestures performed by the Vile-Prince, the spell formation rotated constantly. At a certain point, the Vile-Prince suddenly looked up and pulled out a transmission jade slip.</p><br/><p>\u201cDammit! Can\u2019t anybody stop him?! You want to kill me, Bai Xiaochun? You\u2019re just asking to be cut down! Let\u2019s see who\u2019s faster, you or me. I\u2019m so close to succeeding!\u201d Face twisting with rage, he sent a message to his father. After a long moment passed in which he got no response, he got flustered, and started sending messages to the celestials in the city.</p><br/><p>He made all sorts of promises of incredible compensation in order to get their help, and when he finally got a response, he breathed a sigh of relief. Still worried though, he ordered the demigods under his command to intercept Bai Xiaochun.</p><br/><p>The experts in Vile-Prince Mansion had no choice but to brace themselves and fly out into the open. By this point, Bai Xiaochun had reached the heart of Vile-Emperor City, and was closing in rapidly.</p><br/><p>Before the Vile-Prince\u2019s minions could reach him though, the celestials who had responded to his promised rewards arrived. Daoist Heavenspan, Prince Ur-Demon, Reverend Devourer, and Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a all appeared.</p><br/><p>The first thing they did was try to convince Bai Xiaochun to stop.\u00a0</p><br/><p>\u201cBack down, Bai Xiaochun!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Vile-Emperor is coming out of seclusion at any moment, Bai Xiaochun. Wake up! We can work things out, there\u2019s no reason for all of this!\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>On any other occasion, Bai Xiaochun might have agreed to a compromise. But right now, his eyes were bloodshot, and his murderous aura raged to unheard-of levels. Never before in his life had he been this dead set on killing people.</p><br/><p>\u201cAll of you\u2026 get the hell out of my way!!\u201d He didn\u2019t waste time with words. He immediately resorted to the Mountain Shaking Bash, adding in raw fleshly body power and energy from his cultivation base. He even used the Undying Hex and his Godkiller technique.</p><br/><p>A boom could be heard as he slammed into Prince Ur-Demon and Daoist Heavenspan. Blood sprayed out of both of their mouths as they were sent tumbling to the side. As for Reverend Devourer and Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a, although they were still leery about the situation, they still tried to block Bai Xiaochun\u2019s path.</p><br/><p>More booms rang out as Bai Xiaochun himself coughed up blood, his chest completely caved in. However, he didn\u2019t seem to care. Laughing with madness, he grabbed Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a and violently headbutted him.</p><br/><p>As Celestial Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a coughed up blood, he realized that Bai Xiaochun was opening his mouth as if to bite a chunk out of his face. Without any hesitation, Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a paid a heavy price to flee using a secret magic.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s really gone insane!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Meanwhile, as Bai Xiaochun was tangled up with the celestials, the Vile-Prince\u2019s minions were flying out to meet a different intruder!</p><br/><p>He wore black robes that matched his swirling black hair, and wielded a long spear. Although he was clearly a deva, he was obviously powerful enough to fight with demigods!</p><br/><p>He was none other than Song Que!</p><br/><p>After glancing up at the battle being fought between the celestials, he turned toward Vile-Prince Mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cQue\u2019er is here to rescue you, Aunt Junwan!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

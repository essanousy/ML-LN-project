The truth was that, even back in that spectacular battle in the Wildlands, everything had gone according to the gravekeeper\u2019s plans!</p><br/><p>\u201cHe really set everything up perfectly!!\u201d Bai Xiaochun knew that the gravekeeper had actually hoped to kill the Celestial during that battle. Now, it seemed obvious\u2026 that the gravekeeper\u2019s killing intent was showing through in this backup plan!</p><br/><p>This situation with the bone galleon had only unfolded because of the original failure to put an end to the Celestial!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why he gave me his command medallion. It was to keep me safe as I passed through the Deadmire, but also\u2026 to make sure I wasn\u2019t killed during the final phase of this plan with the Celestial!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was completely shocked, and simply couldn\u2019t imagine what kind of mind could come up with such a convoluted and meticulous plan!</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Celestial\u2026 is definitely going to lose again!\u201d After all of these realizations, Bai Xiaochun was feeling more and more uneasy. He didn't care about the Celestial, and was fairly certain that the man would be able to keep Du Lingfei safe. What Bai Xiaochun was worried about was Hou Xiaomei.</p><br/><p>\u201cBack when I saw Hou Xiaomei on Heavenspan Island, I don't think she had been possessed. But the next day\u2026 that strange, sinister aura I sensed was no illusion!</p><br/><p>\u201cJust now, there were definitely soul fluctuations inside of her body, which means she hasn\u2019t been completely consumed\u2026. The only way to save her is to get her soul out of that body!\u201d Unfortunately, it was to his bitterness that he realized that his current cultivation base wasn\u2019t high enough for him to participate in the fight.</p><br/><p>Even the shockwaves from the fighting were too destructive for him to handle. Vision swimming, he stumbled up the staircase, leaving deck 3. At the top of the stairs, he looked around and found that he was on deck 2!</p><br/><p>He almost turned to head back down the stairs. However, based on the fluctuations coming from the fighting down there, he knew that he couldn\u2019t go back. Even as he stood there trying to decide what to do, the twin Master Cloud Lightnings stumbled out of the staircase, followed by Guru Spirit Immortal. As for the other Nascent Soul cultivators who had entered the bedchamber during the fighting, most had been killed by the destructive shockwaves of the battle.</p><br/><p>The Celestial had placed Du Lingfei and her group into his bag of holding, keeping them safe.</p><br/><p>Deck 2 was just like Bai Xiaochun remembered it. The rocking chair was there, slowly moving back and forth, with the two corpses kneeling in front of it in their strange, partially-fused state. Everything else was rife with sinister frigid qi.</p><br/><p>But there was something different about the situation this time. Bai Xiaochun was no longer in the Nascent Soul stage. After glancing at the scene, he sent his divine sense out and onto the rocking chair. In that instant, it stopped moving.</p><br/><p>He took a step closer.</p><br/><p>Last time, he had been very interested in the two corpses, and had been almost fatally attracted to the auras of the Undying Codex and the Live Forever Codex which remained on them.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, at that time, he had not possessed a deva cultivation base, and had been virtually overwhelmed by fear and a sensation of crisis. As a result, he had eventually just fled for his life.</p><br/><p>But this time, things were different. He was well aware that he would most likely not get a third chance to observe this scene, and therefore, he needed to take advantage of the moment.</p><br/><p>Without any more hesitation, he hurried over toward the rocking chair. As for the twin Master Cloud Lightnings and Guru Spirit Immortal, they reacted differently. This was their first time here, so as soon as they stepped out into the room, they looked around in shock.</p><br/><p>By the time they noticed Bai Xiaochun, he had already reached the skeletons and grabbed ahold of them. In that moment, his expression flickered.</p><br/><p>The moment he touched the skeletons, he could sense the Undying Blood inside of him suddenly surge to life. At the same time, a majestic sensation of qi and blood erupted from the golden corpse which had cultivated the Undying Codex. That aura immediately rushed into his hand, and a moment later, he had another drop of Undying Blood inside of him!!</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t have been more shocked by what happened. However, now was not the time to think about practicing cultivation. Therefore, he suppressed his surprise and quickly put the two corpses into his bag of holding.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat was that you just grabbed, Bai Xiaochun!?\u201d Guru Spirit Immortal said, his eyes glittering. Despite the fact that they were in a moment of critical danger, the old man still could not suppress his greed.</p><br/><p>As for the twin Master Cloud Lightnings, if they hadn\u2019t already come to know a bit about Bai Xiaochun\u2019s background, they would have reacted the same way. But right now, with the Celestial only one deck below, they didn\u2019t dare.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun completely ignored Guru Spirit Immortal. After putting the corpses into his bag of holding, he shot toward the next staircase. Last time, he had been unable to return to deck 1, but now that he had a deva cultivation base, he was able to identify the method to do so.</p><br/><p>However, even as he began to move, Guru Spirit Immortal stepped over to block his way.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe\u2019re all devas here, Bai Xiaochun! Since we all arrived at the same time, we should split any treasure evenly! You think you can just take it all for yourself?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cScrew the hell off!\u201d Bai Xiaochun was worried about Hou Xiaomei, and was also privy to many other secrets that no one else was aware of. Therefore, he had no patience to deal with an irritating old man like this.</p><br/><p>He immediately utilized his Mountain Shaking Bash, shooting forward with incredible speed, and simultaneously unleashing shocking pressure. Guru Spirit Immortal\u2019s face fell, and he quickly dodged to the side.</p><br/><p>With that, Bai Xiaochun passed him and sped up the staircase.</p><br/><p>The twin Master Cloud Lightnings followed behind, and Guru Spirit Immortal did as well, with various expressions flashing across his face.</p><br/><p>In almost the exact same instant that Bai Xiaochun stepped onto deck 1, deck 2 exploded, sending wood splinters flying around in all directions. At the same time, the fight between the Celestial, Gongsun Wan\u2019er, and Ghostmother spilled over into the former location of deck 2.</p><br/><p>Deck 1 looked just like it had before, without the slightest change. The fascinating, life-like mural could still be seen on the bulkheads. Of course, Bai Xiaochun had already looked at it in the past. Therefore, he barely glanced at it before rushing toward the next set of stairs, which led up to the main deck.</p><br/><p>As soon as the twin Master Cloud Lightnings and Guru Spirit Immortal reached deck 1 though, they were immediately drawn into the mural.</p><br/><p>Bai Xiaochun ignored them. In the blink of an eye, he was in the cabin above deck 1, and then\u2026 out on the main deck of the bone galleon!</p><br/><p>The sky was murky and dim, and the ship was surrounded by a sea of bones. There were three flags visible, with three enigmatic ghost faces on them, rippling despite the lack of any wind\u2026. Because of everything he had seen, because of the pressure weighing down on him, and because of the aura of the Deadmire that he recognized, the final, last bit of hesitation in him disappeared.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe really are back in the Deadmire\u2026.\u201d he murmured. Even as he looked around, the twin Master Cloud Lightnings and Guru Spirit Immortal stumbled out onto the deck, coughing up mouthfuls of blood.</p><br/><p>Moments later, three other figures burst out onto the main deck!</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t escape, Ghostmother!\u201d Gongsun Wan\u2019er shrieked. \u201cI <em>will</em> consume you!!\u201d As she shot toward Ghostmother, the expressionless Celestial also advanced. Between the two of them, they continued to shove Ghostmother backward across the battlefield!</p><br/><p>Moments later, the handful of lucky cultivators who had survived the trial by fire began to emerge. When they found themselves on the main deck, and saw the fight going on in the air above them, they trembled with shock, and some even cried out loud in alarm.</p><br/><p>\u201cHeavens! That\u2019s\u2026 that's the Celestial!!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2026 where are we?!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe exit led to a ship? How is that possible?!?! What is this place? Are we even still in the lands of Heavenspan\u2026?\u201d Bai Lin and Zhao Tianjiao were present, although they were badly injured, and were being held up by Big Fatty Zhang.</p><br/><p>The only one who didn't react with complete surprise was Song Que\u2026. Trembling, he looked around in disbelief, and then glanced over at Bai Xiaochun for confirmation.</p><br/><p>\u201cWe're in the Deadmire.\u201d Bai Xiaochun said, his mood dropping rapidly with every moment that passed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

On a hot summer day like this even he himself wouldn\u2019t accept not taking a shower to wash off the sweat that they had accumulated during the day.</p><br/><p>As soon as they entered their dormitory room, Qin Xu habitually laid down onto his own bed and started playing on his phone. He guessed that Jiang Yang was probably feeling very complicated inside. He didn\u2019t want to use his body to wash up, but he also didn\u2019t want to get the other guy to help him wash up; while debating over these two options, Jiang Yang would undoubtedly head to the bathroom first.</p><br/><p>As always, Qin Xu understood Jiang Yang very well.</p><br/><p>When Xiao Yuxin finished washing up, Jiang Yang picked up his clothes and headed into the bathroom with a face of bravado. Because his mind was filled with thoughts, he didn\u2019t notice Xiao Yuxin\u2019s strange look as he looked in Qin Xu\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin\u2019s first reaction after seeing \u201cJiang Yang\u201d lying on Qin Xu\u2019s bed was surprise but very quickly he recalled the scene he saw in the bathroom last time. In addition to that, they\u2019ve been getting along pretty well these days so\u2026\u2026This seemed quite normal?</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin dried his hair and unconsciously found his eyes moving over to \u201cJiang Yang\u2019s\u201d direction.</p><br/><p>Being watched like that, Qin Xu naturally noticed it. He looked up and asked: \u201cNeed something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin was surprised. He reflexively shook his head and then quickly nodded his head. His lips moved slightly and with hesitation he asked: \u201cJiang Yang you\u2026.do you like Qin Xu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu heard this and suddenly became spirited. Finally, someone else also had the same thoughts as him. He threw down his phone and asked with a look of anticipation: \u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin panicked a little, \u201cIt\u2019s just that, didn\u2019t you hate him before? But now you\u2019re with him pretty much all the time and you guys act very close. Once, I couldn\u2019t sleep and I saw you peeking at him from your bed and even help cover him with his blanket\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd then?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin was confused: \u201cWhat and then?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBesides these, anything else?</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no\u2026..\u201d Xiao Yuxin was confused. Why is he reacting so strangely? It was as if he wanted him to present solid evidence of him liking Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>The arm supporting Qin Xu loosened and he once again fell back into his bed. He was disappointed that he didn\u2019t manage to hear about something he didn\u2019t already know about.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin looked on and couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cYou really like him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Although Xiao Yuxin was afraid of angering him, but as his friend, he felt the need to speak out, \u201cBut, both you and Qin Xu are men. And he often provokes and quarrels with you. He even likes Wu Tong from class three, you\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>He said this hesitantly but the meaning behind his words were clear. He was basically saying that since they were both men, and because Qin Xu doesn\u2019t get along with him and even has someone he likes, he probably didn\u2019t have a chance.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu shrugged and said indifferently: \u201cWho says that he likes Wu Tong? That is something that happened eight hundred years ago. Also, do you think that Qin Xu is not good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin was startled. Although he felt that Qin Xu is a cold person and difficult to get along with, he naturally wouldn\u2019t speak bad of something behind their backs. He could only respond dryly: \u201cNo\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s shameless narcissism was stimulated by this. He started relentlessly showering himself with compliments, \u201cThat\u2019s right, Qin Xu is really good. Not only is he handsome, he also has a good physique, have good grades, is good at playing basketball and fighting, and he treats his friends very well. Although he may have not dated before, he is definitely someone who is loyal and devoted. Once he decides on someone, it would be difficult to change his mind\u2026.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>He chattered on non-stop. Since he was talking about himself, he naturally knew himself best and boasted effortlessly.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin listened to his chatter and thought \u2014 There\u2019s no point trying to change his mind now. Jiang Yang has completely fallen. He likes Qin Xu to the point of no return.</p><br/><p>He originally wanted to talk it out with Jiang Yang firstly because he was worried that it would affect his studies and secondly because he felt like it was impossible for them and Jiang Yang would get hurt. But seeing how things are now, it looks like he can no longer be saved. He could only hope that Qin Xu would also see him the same way.</p><br/><p>However, based on his current observations, it looked like Qin Xu also had a good impression of Jiang Yang. It will have to be left up to their own devices if they wanted this relationship to be successful. Xiao Yuxin sighed and deeply related with a fathers\u2019 sorrow.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang quickly washed up and came out, and Qin Xu promptly went inside. He was even given a warning glance on his way in, but Qin Xu wasn\u2019t afraid. He was certain that Jiang Yang would not follow him into the bathroom. He washed up as per usual and when he walked out he saw Jiang Yang sitting on his bed playing on his phone. An inexplicable urge to tease him surged inside and he smirked while saying: \u201cHmm\u2026. I suddenly noticed that my physique is pretty good. I even have a four pack\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>He lifted his shirt up and narcissistically touched his stomach. The moment Jiang Yang saw this, he instantly leapt up and rushed over to stop him. While pulling his shirt back down he said through gritted teeth: \u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu looked at him innocently: \u201cI\u2019m just complimenting you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was in such a rush that he had almost flown over to stop him. He practically restrained him with a hug and, with his arms around Qin Xu\u2019s waist, he didn\u2019t feel anything strange. After all, for him that was his own body and he was solely concerned about stopping Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin who had not left yet, was once again forced to witness this intimate scene between them and felt very complicated inside. He immediately packed his things up and very carefully closed the door behind him. He thought, yeah, maybe he was overthinking things. They might have already started dating in secret, so he should just silently send them his blessings.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu who was suddenly clung onto by Jiang Yang pretended to act helpless while a smug smile rested on the corner of his lips. He obviously saw Xiao Yuxin quietly leaving while looking at them with a look of understanding. Qin Xu thought, it couldn\u2019t be helped that others would misunderstand. Who told Jiang Yang to do something that is so easy to cause a misunderstanding? He is also very troubled.</p><br/><p>Despite thinking this, his actions were honest, and a vague smile rested on his face.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu teased: \u201cHow long do you plan to hug me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang heard these words and found it a little strange. He quickly retracted his hand and straightened himself up while giving him a wary glare, \u201cWhat do you mean hug you? That\u2019s my body.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s true. I touched the wrong person.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then pulled up Jiang Yang\u2019s shirt to reveal his firm six-pack with a smirk on his face, \u201cAs expected of the body I created.\u201d</p><br/><p>That itchy sensation instantly made Jiang Yang feel uncomfortable. Who on earth would touch someone else like that in broad daylight?! He couldn\u2019t help but feel goose bumps forming all over his body. He subconsciously wanted to swat away Qin Xu\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu however responded by raising his eyebrows and answered naturally: \u201cI\u2019m touching my own body. Why should you care?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, it sounded rather reasonable. He really was not in the position to care about what others do to their own bodies. Jiang Yang heard those words and was temporarily stunned. The hand that he had raised to swat away Qin Xu\u2019s hand also froze mid-air. He reluctantly said: \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a few muscles? What\u2019s so good about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu replied calmly: \u201cOf course its good. Don\u2019t you already know that I\u2019m pretty narcissistic?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d For a moment, he didn\u2019t know how to refute that.</p><br/><p>Despite considering things on the biological level and understanding that Qin Xu was just touching his own body, the person who is controlling his body now is him. Jiang Yang frowned and proceeded to grab onto Qin Xu\u2019s hand wanting to push it away. Unfortunately, Qin Xu had already expected this and responded by stretching his foot out to trip him over. Losing his balance, Jiang Yang fell backwards and collapsed onto Qin Xu\u2019s bed. Even if the thin mattress is soft, the boards under it is hard. With a fall like that, he naturally felt some pain on the back of his head and his back.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang who was pressed onto the bed by him and in pain complained angrily: \u201cWhy did you trip me? If you want to harm yourself, you could just tell me and I can help you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu hooked his lips up into a smile: \u201cI\u2019m doing you. Last time you said that you wanted to fuck me. I shouldn\u2019t always be on the receiving end, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang rolled his eyes. He had seen boys pressing each other down saying things like I\u2019ll do you and the like plenty of times before. His first reaction to this was that Qin Xu was just doing this on a whim and is just joking around.</p><br/><p>But the handsome face in front of him was a face that he is most familiar with. Seeing this, he couldn\u2019t help but feel as if he was being pressed down by himself. Jiang Yang subconsciously stared into Qin Xu\u2019s eyes. After exchanging souls, the easiest way for them to distinguish the two was through their gazes. Seeing a hint of provocation flash through those deep and dark eyes of his, it was obvious that the person inside is Qin Xu, the person he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to throw a punch at.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang suppressed the urge inside and reminded himself: This is your face. Your body. You shouldn\u2019t damage it.</p><br/><p>He then raised his hand and planned to use his strength to push the other person away.</p><br/><p>But it just happened that Huang Shao returned at this moment. Opening the door to the dormitory, he was instantly exposed to this passionate scene on the bed. His two eyes shone: \u201cHey, how can you to play without me? Threesome, threesome!\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that he was about to rush over, Jiang yang instantly pushed Qin Xu aside and sat up. Somehow, with this action Qin Xu ended up in his arms while sitting onto his lap. It had to be said that he was a little heavy.</p><br/><p>And so, Huang Shao missed his aim and fell onto the bed while hitting his nose. He wailed pitifully: \u201cYou two are too much~\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu who was suddenly pulled into Jiang Yang\u2019s embrace was also surprised. Returning to his senses, he saw Huang Shao\u2019s state and purposely looped his hands around Jiang Yang\u2019s neck while chuckling: \u201cWhy should we let you bother us when we\u2019re having fun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao was even more upset: \u201cXiao Yang Yang, didn\u2019t you say that you loved me the most? You changed your heart\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang heard this and couldn\u2019t help but karate-chop the top of Huang Shao\u2019s head, \u201cWhat nonsense are you going on about? Hurry up and go shower!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao saw that he was just hit by Qin Xu and his eyes widened in shock. He looked at the two as if he was someone who was just cheated on and had caught them red-handed. He wiped away his non-existent tears and left \u2018dejectedly\u2019. While showering, he sang energetically and did not sound like someone who had just been heart-broken.</p><br/><p>Inside the room, Jiang Yang and Qin Xu both had a dark expression.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang shivered and pushed the person in his lap away while rubbing the goose bumps that had formed on his arms.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu watched him do this from the side while laughing silently.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

In situations like this, Qin Xu would usually break the silence by saying something that would anger Jiang Yang and the two would then start bickering with each other non-stop. However, Qin Xu at this moment was still immersed in the kiss that had just taken place and had not yet returned to his senses.</p><br/><p>The two walked on and both were preoccupied thinking about different things.</p><br/><p>Not far ahead, Jiang Yang suddenly heard a soft meow. He looked over and saw a thin orange kitten hiding behind a flower bed meowing at him while staring at the bag in his hands with its round eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but stop his steps and walk over. Qin Xu next to him saw him stop and also followed behind him.</p><br/><p>The two tall teenagers then proceeded to bend down next to the flower bed and looked a little pitiful from behind. Jiang Yang gently reached out and the small kitten warily retreated backwards. But it was attracted by the sweet smell coming from the cake in his bag, so it didn\u2019t retreat too far.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang gently touched the kitten\u2019s furry head. He obviously didn\u2019t dare to give it the cake as there was chocolate in it, but the kitten clearly looked hungry.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang pursed his lips and wondered if there was a store nearby that sells cat food. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t live in this area, so he wasn\u2019t very familiar with the stores.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu crouched down next to him with his shoulder occasionally brushing up against Jiang Yang\u2019s as he also wanted to reach out to play with the kitten. The kitten however showed a stronger resistance to him. Baring its teeth, it even revealed its claws to demonstrate that it would lash out if he came any closer. Qin Xu was upset. He originally thought that if he reached out behind jiang Yang, he would be able to caress the kittens head, but they had received vastly different treatments.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll go buy cat food. You can wait here for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu said this and, without waiting for Jiang Yang\u2019s reply, he turned to leave. Leaving only Jiang Yang and the kitten, the two looked at each other in surprise.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the kitten took advantage of when Jiang Yang is surprised and leapt over to Jiang Yang\u2019s bag. Jiang Yang managed to react quickly and pried it off his bag. He held the kitten back using his finger and no matter how much the kitten struggled, its short legs couldn\u2019t reach.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang educated it with sincerity: \u201cYou can\u2019t eat it. If you eat it you\u2019ll get sick. Be good.\u201d</p><br/><p>If Qin Xu was here, he definitely wouldn\u2019t say those words but since Qin Xu isn\u2019t here, it didn\u2019t matter.</p><br/><p>\u201cSister is this cat yours?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, a clear male voice travelled over. Jiang Yang turned his head to look and saw that it was a man around his age. With a buzz cut, thick eyebrows and round eyes, he supported his hands on his knees and half bent down to watch him play with the cat.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jiang Yang, as a steel straight man, didn\u2019t even consider the fact that he could be picked up and merely thought that the other party was interested in the cat.</p><br/><p>\u201cI see. You probably want to feed it right? I also like cats, but stray cats aren\u2019t usually very close to people. You can buy it some Whiskas. Cats love to eat those.\u201d The man bent down next to him and explained patiently.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang nodded with a rather cold expression to demonstrate that he was listening, but he didn\u2019t talk much. After all, he is a stranger.</p><br/><p>The man felt that the sisters\u2019 attitude is a little cold, but he naturally wouldn\u2019t give up so easily. He spoke up and continued: \u201cDo you need me to help you buy it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang frowned, and he had some doubts inside. He looked over at him, \u201c\u2026.Are you a Whiskas salesman?\u201d</p><br/><p>Man: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The air suddenly turned quiet and the man felt a little embarrassed. He shook his head quickly: \u201cOf course not. I just know where to buy it. If you want to buy it, I can tell you where it is. I have absolutely no relationship with them and I\u2019m not a salesman!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang watched him deny it so fervently and realised that he had probably misunderstood. He nodded his head, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Oh. It\u2019s okay, someone\u2019s buying cat food already.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man heard this and groaned a little inside. With some hesitation he asked: \u201cYour boyfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was even more confused. He felt that this person is strangely jumping from topic to topic without any logic behind it. He shook his head and coldly denied, \u201cI don\u2019t have a boyfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man breathed a sigh of relief but just as he wanted to say something, he was suddenly pulled back by his collar and he fell onto the ground pitifully.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat damned Qin Xu. The moment I get a hold of you\u2026..Fuck, who is this?\u201d A tall, unpleasant looking man said through gritted teeth after seeing the face of the man on the floor and turned to look at his brother behind him, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you saw Qin Xu with his girlfriend? Who is this? Are you blind?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who came over purely to flirt with Jiang Yang was stunned. He saw that the man who had tossed him to the ground not only had tattoos on his arm, he also had dyed hair. All that was missing was the word \u2018thug\u2019 written on his face. No matter how he looked at it, it was obvious that he wasn\u2019t someone he should mess with. Behind him were three suspicious subordinates. The man had not encountered something like this and could only timidly say: \u201cYou probably saw wrong\u2026..I\u2019m not called Qin Xu.\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the subordinates insisted, \u201cI didn\u2019t see wrong. It really was Qin Xu. See, this girl was with Qin Xu earlier. It only took me a few minutes to bring you over, but I didn\u2019t realise that he would run off so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man sitting on the ground blinked a few times. Did he just try to flirt with a thug boss\u2019s girl? And the opposing gang is here to find trouble?! The man let his own imaginations go wild and proceeded to scare himself.</p><br/><p>The leading tattooed man glared fiercely at Jiang Yang: \u201cQin Xu\u2019s girlfriend? That guy is dating? Just right, tell me where he is now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang squatted on the floor and pried the cat away from his cake. With a look of indifference, he stood up and didn\u2019t look scared at all. Rather than answering their questions, he returned with a question from his end: \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The tattooed man replied impatiently, \u201cWhat does that have to do with you? You should just answer my question and stop wasting my time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who tried to pick up Jiang Yang was a little scared, but he couldn\u2019t just leave a girl behind in such a situation. He looked around him and shuffled over to Jiang Yang wanting to cover him as he tried to placate the others: \u201cThe person you are looking for is Qin Xu. Why do you need to trouble a girl? You\u2019ll scare her\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The tattooed man was in a very bad mood because he ended up finding two people who had nothing to do with Qin Xu. With a snort he asked, \u201cWho are you? Qin Xu\u2019s friend? You want to be a hero?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man immediately shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m just a passer-by but\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The tattooed man didn\u2019t have the patience to listen to him further and just proceeded to push him away. He grabbed onto Jiang Yang\u2019s arm and pulled him over, \u201cSince you\u2019re his girlfriend then if you suddenly disappear, Qin Xu would naturally try to find you. One of you stay here and bring him over when he returns.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who wanted to help couldn\u2019t defeat those four experienced gangsters. He could only watch the girl get taken away before him. The man gritted his teeth and frowned as he pretended to walk away before quickly calling the police.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was pulled into a small alley and several men stood beside him to prevent him from running away.</p><br/><p>The tattooed man who appeared to be the head of the gang pulled out a cigarette from his pocket and lit it before taking a drag and spitting out the smoke. Jiang Yang stood next to him and couldn\u2019t help but frown at the suffocating smell.</p><br/><p>The subordinates on the side looked at Jiang Yang. In the dark alley, Jiang Yang\u2019s clear and beautiful face, thin waist and long legs looked even more conspicuous. As if it glowed, his appearance attracted their attention.</p><br/><p>One of the subordinates laughed and wanted to touch Jiang Yang\u2019s face, \u201cQin Xu\u2019s taste is pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before his hand could make contact, a loud and painful slap was heard. The subordinate was angry but when he looked over at the perpetrator he saw that it was his own boss and he didn\u2019t dare say anything.</p><br/><p>The tattooed man threw away the cigarette butt and extinguished it with his foot. He coldly looked over at his subordinate. Although he didn\u2019t say anything, it was clear that he was warning him not to go too far.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang raised his eyebrows in surprise. At the same time, he couldn\u2019t help but raise his hand to fan away the smoke in front of his nose. The alley was narrow and, because of that, the air circulation was poor. Jiang Yang felt stuffy and wanted to turn and walk out the alley. They were looking for Qin Xu and it had nothing to do with him so why should he wait idiotically for him here? He had already calmly explained that he\u2019s not Qin Xu\u2019s girlfriend but what can he do if the other party wouldn\u2019t listen?</p><br/><p>As soon as he moved, the tattooed man grabbed onto his wrist and threatened him in a cold voice: \u201cHe\u2019s not here yet so you can\u2019t leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>He gripped strongly, and Jiang Yang felt the pain to his very bones. What was more important however was that the moment he grabbed Jiang Yang\u2019s hand, the cake had flown out and smashed against the corner of the wall. Without even needing to check, it was obvious that the cake was ruined.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s expression suddenly went dark as he looked at the bag on the ground. He had spent 100 yuan to buy those cakes and there was even the first-place prize cake in there. He had originally wanted to enjoy it slowly at Qin Xu\u2019s place after dinner tonight but now\u2026\u2026It\u2019s! All! Gone!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t make any sound and, with his lips pursed tight, the surrounding atmosphere suddenly changed. The men around him had a bad feeling. They couldn\u2019t help but feel like they had ruined something important to the girl and wondered if they should apologise\u2026..?</p><br/><p>However, they then shook off that thought. An apology is impossible. They didn\u2019t want to ruin their image.</p><br/><p>And so \u2014\u2014\u2014- \u201cIsn\u2019t it just a few cakes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t it just a few cakes?</p><br/><p>The moment Jiang Yang heard those words, he found it completely unacceptable. Today was already a bad day for him and he was in a bad mood because of that. The only thing that would be able to comfort him were those delicious cakes but now they\u2019re ruined. And the person they were looking for is Qin Xu so why must he be the one to suffer?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s mentality collapsed and all the anger that he had accumulated throughout the day immediately erupted. He turned around and started throwing out his fists, raising his legs to kick and throwing them over his shoulder\u2026\u2026\u2026He had exploded so suddenly, the men were taken by surprise and was caught off guard. Not to mention, they had a preconceived impression that he was just a weak and harmless little girl so when Jiang Yang went crazy, they were completely stunned and could only react a few seconds later. Unfortunately, that time delay was just enough for Jiang Yang to overwhelm them.</p><br/><p>And so, when the subordinate returned with Qin Xu, he arrived at the scene of his comrades groaning on the ground and the \u201cweak and fragile girl\u201d standing in the middle of the alley looking at them with a cold expression. For a second, he couldn\u2019t help but suspect that a god had just descended from the heavens.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu had raced over anxiously but when he saw this scene, he was shocked for a few seconds before the corners of his lips twitched and he laughed. He didn\u2019t know whether he should he happy or disappointed.</p><br/><p>In any case, he raised his fist and proceeded to bring down the subordinate that had brought him over.</p><br/><p>By the time the police arrived, they only saw a few thugs who had already been beaten black and blue lying in the alleyway. They couldn\u2019t help but look over at the informant, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that they dragged a girl over to the alley? Where is she? What happened here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man who had called the police was also stunned\u2026..That\u2019s right. Where did she go?</p><br/><p>After leaving the alley, Qin Xu carried a bag of cat food in his hand and felt a little guilty inside: \u201cDo you want to buy the cakes again? It\u2019s my fault so I\u2019ll pay for it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang coldly refused: \u201cNo need.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, although he was unluckily dragged into Qin Xu\u2019s mess, he felt a lot more refreshed after beating those thugs up. Qin Xu however didn\u2019t know this so when he heard him refuse his offer to get cakes, he couldn\u2019t help but be worried inside.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu awkwardly apologised and tried to explain, \u201cThose people earlier were from my middle school days. They lost to me in a fight and wasn\u2019t willing to accept it so they\u2019re always looking for me for another fight. But now I don\u2019t fight much. My mum may be pretty easy-going, but she obviously doesn\u2019t allow things like this\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang listened to him trying to explain and tilted his head in suspicion. What on earth did he want to say? Because his mum doesn\u2019t like it, he\u2019s not fighting anymore?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to say after saying all that? So what if you fight?\u201d Jiang Yang interrupted him and asked straightforwardly.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat is\u2026\u2026\u201d Qin Xu furrowed his brows. He also didn\u2019t know why he wanted to explain. He just felt a little guilty and was worried that Jiang Yang was unhappy and would have a bad impression of him. But actually\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang sneered, \u201cYou don\u2019t fight much? Then who is that person I\u2019m fighting with almost every day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201cUh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was momentarily at loss for words.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang added: \u201cDon\u2019t forget how we met in first year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had fought the moment they met, and it was a classic example of getting to know each other through their fists. Afterwards, because they had to deal with the instructor, they represented the school in the basketball competition together. For boys to get along, it was actually very easy. You just needed to meet at least one of the three criteria\u2019s; basketball, games or fights, and they just happened to meet all three.</p><br/><p>Even Jiang Yang had to admit that this was the case. \u201cSo what if you fight? There are some things that can only be solved with fists. Although I don\u2019t want to say it, you and I are quite similar in some respects. Why don\u2019t you want to admit that you fight often?\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, Qin Xu\u2019s lips curved up and a smile spread through his face. He was in an especially good mood after hearing him say that they were quite similar.</p><br/><p>They took the taxi to his complex and it was Jiang Yang\u2019s second time going to Qin Xu\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>If he doesn\u2019t go out, then he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about other people recognising him. Jiang Yang sat on the sofa with bare feet and started to play games on his phone. He had already decided that lunch and dinner would be takeaway food.</p><br/><p>When Jiang Yang opened the door, he had just returned from being immersed in his game and had forgotten that he still had the appearance of a girl. He boldly opened the door and leaned against the door frame lazily as he checked with the delivery brother the correct order.</p><br/><p>The delivery brother had arrived while sweating buckets from the heat and was a little annoyed. However, he didn\u2019t expect to see a pale, long legged beauty opening the door when he arrived. His eyes brightened up and he felt his mood improve greatly. Even the tone that he used to speak with had softened down significantly.</p><br/><p>\u201cOne garlic shrimp rice, one roast duck rice and two cans of coke. Is this the correct order?\u201d The little brother asked.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang nodded and reached out to take it. The delivery brother however didn\u2019t turn to leave. Instead, he smiled and said enthusiastically: \u201cBeautiful girl if it tastes good, please give us a five-star rating. You are welcome to order from us again.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, a tall figure appeared behind the beautiful girl and he proceeded to naturally and affectionately reach out to hold the girl\u2019s shoulders. In a deep, magnetic voice he asked: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me to go get the takeaway?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without even needing to think, Jiang Yang gave him a look, \u201cDoes it matter who gets it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course, it does.\u201d Qin Xu looked down at the person in his arms affectionately. He then looked up at the little brother and the look in his eyes instantly changed into one that was dark and filled with warning. The little brother saw this and felt his back go cold. He couldn\u2019t help but feel scared.</p><br/><p>The delivery brother quickly said: \u201cThen I\u2019ll be going now. I wish you an enjoyable meal!\u201d</p><br/><p>After turning around to leave, he muttered in dissatisfaction; What are you glaring at me for? Laozi has a girlfriend okay? I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to flip that dog food of yours!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was satisfied by his performance and pulled Jiang Yang back into the house. Because his movements were so natural, Jiang Yang didn\u2019t find anything wrong with it and was too preoccupied with his thoughts on the food in the bag.</p><br/><p>The two sat on the rug with their legs crossed and were too lazy to pull out the dining table. They huddled around the coffee table and began to eat. By the time they were almost done, Qin Xu picked up his phone and prepared to give it a rating.</p><br/><p>The taste of the food was okay, so he gave it a middle score and when he reached the question asking about how the delivery brother was, out of habit his finger moved over to the five-star rating. With the bright yellow stars shining before him, Qin Xu pursed his lips a little. His finger gently tapped at the screen again as he deliberately removed a star.</p><br/><p>When he was done with this, Qin Xu looked up at Jiang Yang who sat opposite him. Seeing that he didn\u2019t notice his actions, he naturally returned the screen back to the main menu and acted as if he had not done anything.</p><br/><p>In the evening, Jiang Yang sat on the living room sofa holding the remote control while watching a variety show on TV. Just as he was enjoying the show and laughing along with the jokes, he looked up and saw Qin Xu come out of the bathroom after showering. Clean and refreshed, there were even small beads of water still hanging from his body. The most important thing was \u2014\u2014\u2014- He\u2019s! Not! Wearing! Clothes!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang saw this scene with his own eyes and was almost choked to death by his own saliva.</p><br/><p>\u201cPut your clothes on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at the exposed wheat-coloured skin and his smooth and powerful muscles. It was basically the perfect figure that a man would yearn for; wide shoulders, narrow waist and long legs, but Jiang Yang wasn\u2019t in the mood to appreciate it. He was more scared and uncomfortable at the sight than anything.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu shrugged indifferently, \u201cI am wearing something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yes, just a pair of underpants.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang restrained himself and stressed in a low growl: \u201c\u2026\u2026..I am referring to clothes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu casually walked over to the sofa and planted his butt down next to Jiang Yang: \u201cWhy should I be so careful at home? This is what I find most comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was speechless. What he said was fine but, \u201cDid you forget that there\u2019s a guest here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat guest? With our relationship, we can disregard all those rules. You can also do whatever you want.\u201d Qin Xu answered naturally and even gave Jiang Yang a look that looked like he was saying that if he also wanted to do the same, he is welcome to.</p><br/><p>Come on, let\u2019s do it. There\u2019s still a lot of time~</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He supported his forehead and found the situation a little unbearable. However, this is indeed Qin Xu\u2019s home so, even if he was concerned by those behaviours of his, he could only choose to endure. And so, he tried his hardest to move his attention back to the variety show on TV. They had just reached a funny game section but for some reason he no longer found it interesting. Instead, Jiang Yang could clearly feel the heat and moisture coming from the figure next to him.</p><br/><p>He thought that perhaps he was sitting a little too close to Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>He subconsciously shuffled across a few inches, but Qin Xu supported his arm on the back of the sofa, lifted his ass, and planted it back down such that he was once again sitting very close to Jiang Yang. Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but feel uncomfortable to the point that the hair on his back stood up. Fuck! What is going on?!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but explode inside.</p><br/><p>When he wanted to say something, Qin Xu seemingly guessed that he was touching his bottom line and no longer leaned any further in Jiang Yang\u2019s direction. Instead, he stood up with a grin on his face and then sighed: \u201cOkay, okay. I\u2019ll go put some clothes on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026???\u201d</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t putting on clothes something that he should be doing normally? Why is he acting as if he\u2019s only doing it to placate me?! Is this guy crazy?!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang watched his figure disappear into his bedroom and complained internally. It had to be said though, the moment Qin Xu left, the uncomfortable feeling Jiang Yang had been feeling until now had dissipated. He even unconsciously breathed a sigh of relief; he could now finally return his attention back to the TV.</p><br/><p>However, this relief of his didn\u2019t last very long. When Qin Xu returned from his bedroom, he breezily said something, as if he had just remembered it.</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I almost forgot to tell you. The blankets in the guest room were taken by the auntie to get washed so there aren\u2019t any other places for you to sleep. If you don\u2019t mind, you can share a bed with me tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d I mind! I mind a lot!</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI forgot. It\u2019s not a big deal anyway.\u201d Qin Xu shrugged indifferently. And then as if he suddenly remembered he let out a long sound of realisation, \u201cI almost forgot. You\u2019re a girl now so you don\u2019t want to sleep with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Do you want to die?!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was angered by this and he immediately flew over towards Qin Xu and pushed him down onto the ground. Qin Xu fell backwards from the momentum and his head collided with the ground with a dull sound. With his eyes closed, he laid on the ground motionless.</p><br/><p>Did he faint?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang froze. He didn\u2019t expect him to be so fragile and to fall with just one blow. Jiang Yang sat on Qin Xu\u2019s waist a little dazed and didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you really faint?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was still slightly suspicious, so he leaned down and moved his face closer to Qin Xu. He examined his face carefully; looks pretty calm, his eyes didn\u2019t seem to move under his eyelids, and his face looked pretty relaxed. It looks like he really did faint.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang hesitated for a few seconds before standing up and moving over to his side. He then looked down at him for a few more seconds. After pondering for a moment, he decided to drag him over to the sofa. He rubbed his hand over the back of Qin Xu\u2019s head to see how serious the impact was and if a lump had formed.</p><br/><p>When his fingers found the lump, Jiang Yang pursed his lips and felt a little guilty. He knelt by the sofa and looked at Qin Xu for a while before getting up to find the first aid kit in the living room. At this moment, he had his back facing the sofa, so he didn\u2019t see the figure on the sofa sneakily open his eyes to look at him and smirk.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang found the first aid kid and hurriedly turned back around. Qin Xu had already closed his eyes again and continued to play the role of a fainted person.</p><br/><p>The first aid box was opened, and Jiang Yang pulled out some cotton balls and a bottle of safflower oil. Dying the cotton balls with the red oil, he rubbed the cotton ball over the lump on the back of Qin Xu\u2019s head. After a few rounds, Jiang Yang felt that it was probably enough and stopped. He then proceeded to pack the first aid kit back up and dispose of the garbage.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the person on the sofa let out a vague noise. He slowly blinked a few times to adapt to the bright lights and he looked over at Jiang Yang with a blank look, \u201cWho are you? I\u2026\u2026Who am I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Is this a Korean drama? How can a bump in the head can cause you to lose your memory? Are you made from porcelain? Like this, am I supposed to be responsible for you for the rest of my life?!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at the \u201camnesiac\u201d patient in front of him with confusion and for a moment he was at loss. After the incident last time, Jiang Yang naturally wouldn\u2019t impulsively make the same mistake of saying that he is his daddy. Instead, he furrowed his brows and deliberately tried to probe Qin Xu out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you forget everything? Do you still remember that your name is dog?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, Jiang Yang watched Qin Xu\u2019s reaction carefully. Qin Xu on the other hand did his best to keep his face taunt and employed his best acting skills to continue to look innocent and confused, \u201cMy name? I don\u2019t remember\u2026.. Also, my head hurts\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The \u201cinnocent\u201d Qin Xu raised his hand to touch his head, but Jiang Yang quickly grabbed onto his wrist, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt. It\u2019s just your imagination.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that so\u2026\u2026\u201d Qin Xu slowly answered and seemingly believed Jiang Yang. He then yawned childishly, \u201cI\u2019m sleepy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, then go to sleep.\u201d Jiang Yang responded coldly. He obviously wouldn\u2019t believe something as absurd as amnesia.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere should I sleep? That room?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not going to sleep with me? I\u2019m scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang swept a look over to Qin Xu and was a little at awe. To act like he had lost his memories, he was even able to say something like that without feeling disgusted. If it was Jiang Yang, he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to say something like that. Sure enough, is it because his skin is not thick enough?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang gritted his teeth and hesitated over whether he should play along with Qin Xu. Two seconds later, he gave up. With his arms crossed in front of his chest, he said tauntingly: \u201cCall me brother first.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had originally wanted Qin Xu to feel uncomfortable, but he didn\u2019t expect Qin Xu to answer without any hesitation: \u201cBrother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d Suddenly he found it boring.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but roll his eyes and walk over to the bedroom. On his way, he even kicked Qin Xu lightly: \u201cAlright. Stop acting. If you continue, I\u2019ll want to vomit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu blinked a few times and his expression changed from a look of innocence to a teasing grin, \u201cIs my acting that bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s good, very good. You\u2019re almost about to reach the heavens like that. Do you find it funny teasing me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d Qin Xu didn\u2019t even need to think.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d The veins on Jiang Yang\u2019s forehead throbbed.</p><br/><p>The two entered the bedroom one after another and Jiang Yang was too lazy to say too much. He said directly: \u201cToday I helped you out so when you sleep tonight be good and don\u2019t roll over.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was only one bed and the two had to sleep together. Jiang Yang thought back to Qin Xu\u2019s actions in the past and felt that it was necessary to give him a warning to settle down.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu showed a look of distress. Supporting his chin, he said: \u201cBut I have a habit of holding things when I sleep. I can\u2019t control myself when I\u2019m sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201cI don\u2019t care. If you can\u2019t control yourself, I\u2019ll kick you off the bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu chuckled and didn\u2019t feel threatened by his glare. Instead, he spread his arms apart, gracefully fell onto the bed backwards and said: \u201cThat\u2019s right. Since you helped me, I should repay you. Come on baby!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Jiang Yang\u2019s mouth twitched, and he couldn\u2019t look at him straight. He ruthlessly slapped him aside, turned off the lights and laid down. With a cold voice he said: \u201cShut up and sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was disappointed that his passionate declaration to entrust his body to Jiang Yang was ignored so easily but he could only obediently lay down onto the bed and turn to face Jiang Yang.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had his eyes closed but he could not be considered to be calm. There was no sign of him about to fall asleep and he couldn\u2019t help but think back to the incident that happened today during the competition where their lips had accidentally made contact. Even now that soft sensation was vivid in his mind and he could still feel the faint residual warmth on his lips.</p><br/><p>So annoying.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was very irritated, and he consequently wasn\u2019t sleepy at all. He wanted to scream and kick at the sky but because he couldn\u2019t do that he was even more annoyed. The reason why he was so anxious to fall asleep was so that he didn\u2019t need to see Qin Xu\u2019s face. Ever since the kiss, he felt extremely uncomfortable. Whenever he sees that culprits face, he had the urge to beat him up but despite beating him up he didn\u2019t feel any sense of satisfaction. Seeing his face made him irritated and so he decided to just turn the lights off and sleep.</p><br/><p>He stared at the ceiling in daze for an unknown period of time before his consciously slowly slipped away and he fell into deep sleep.</p><br/><p>When he opened his eyes, Jiang Yang felt that something was wrong. He looked down and saw that there was another hand over his chest. The person who should be sleeping next to him was supporting his chin with his hand and looking at him with a look of amusement. His finger even made small circles and playfully pinched\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Without even thinking Jiang Yang\u2026\u2026\u2026raised his leg and ruthlessly sent out a kick. With a loud thud, Qin Xu rolled off the bed. He groaned while rubbing his head and climbed back up only to see Jiang Yang sitting cross-legged on the bed glaring at him.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the sky had already brightened up and the sunlight peeked through the curtains into the room. The room could be considered to be well illuminated so Jiang Yang could clearly see Qin Xu\u2019s expression.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t feel guilty at all and apologised without a hint of sincerity, \u201cI was just a little curious and wanted to know if you really have a chest. Unfortunately, you already changed back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang heard those words and looked down at his skin. It no longer was pale and had restored back to his light-wheat coloured skin. He subconsciously let out a sigh of relief, but he quickly caught himself the next second. What is he feeling relieved for? He should still be angry okay?!</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck you! Go die!\u201d</p><br/><p>A fist flew over and Qin Xu flexibly avoided it. With a cheeky smile he said: \u201cWe\u2019re all men here, so it\u2019s not a big deal touching each other\u2019s chest. I felt your pectoral muscles; your figure is pretty good. Do you exercise regularly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang naturally didn\u2019t answer him. He just leapt over and started chasing him around while hitting him.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu fled and ran while constantly looking back to check where Jiang Yang was. Throwing back at him a radiant smile, Jiang Yang was even more irated by this. He instantly quickened his pace and managed to grab a hold of Qin Xu\u2019s collar. He pulled him back in his direction while stretching the loose T-shirt. A large part of Qin Xu\u2019s back was exposed and, with the shirt collar tightening around his throat at the front, Qin Xu couldn\u2019t help but be pulled backwards. Jiang Yang took this opportunity to push him onto the ground and the two started scuffling around on the ground to the point that you could no longer tell who was on the top and who was on the bottom.</p><br/><p>Just as they fought passionately, a knocking sound was heard from the front porch and a stranger\u2019s voice could be heard, \u201cCan you not be so noisy so early in the morning?! It\u2019s only six!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and Qin Xu\u2019s movements stopped, and they instantly fell quiet.</p><br/><p>The neighbour seems to have misunderstood something\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>The air around them was both quiet and strange for a moment.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang returned to his senses and pulled at Qin Xu\u2019s collar. Through gritted teeth he said: \u201cWere you having fun earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was now being pressed down and could only blink his eyes a few times and pretend to look harmless, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I was wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was stunned for a moment. He didn\u2019t expect him to be so amiable so suddenly and felt strange inside despite getting an apology. This was particularly so when he looked at the pair of dark, deep eyes that started back at him with sincerity. Jiang Yang pursed his lips and pushed away those strange feelings in his heart before smiling darkly: \u201cDid you think that an apology is enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he said this, he proceeded to throw a punch at Qin Xu\u2019s handsome face. He then patted his hands while standing up and chicly returned to the bed to lie down.</p><br/><p>In fact, Jiang Yang had controlled his strength and he didn\u2019t deliver a strong blow. Qin Xu laughed for a bit before pretentiously clutching his cheek and acting as if he was going to die from the pain. He pitifully climbed onto the bed but he was soon met with Jiang Yang\u2019s cold eyes, \u201cGet lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu felt wronged: \u201cThis is my bed\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang showed no mercy, and just continued to stare at him expressionlessly with no signs of wanting to back down.</p><br/><p>As for Qin Xu, with the speed of lightning he flew over and held onto Jiang Yang. He shamelessly nuzzled up against him and said: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not going. We\u2019ve already kissed so sharing a bed isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d A scene that Jiang Yang didn\u2019t want to recall flashed through his mind and he suddenly had the urge to beat Qin Xu up until he loses his memory.</p><br/><p>He was already feeling strange from that but in the next second Jiang Yang realised that things could still get worse. At his thigh, he suddenly felt something hard\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cFuck!\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but curse out. Compared to his explosive reaction, Qin Xu\u2019s reaction could be considered to be a lot calmer. With his ears slightly red, he scratched his head, \u201cAll men are like this in the morning\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, he even hooked his hand around Jiang Yang and poked his front a few times while jokingly adding: \u201cYou\u2019re like this too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s scalp instantly went numb and, as if he was suddenly zapped, he quickly shrank away before exploding: \u201cAre you fucking out of your mind?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was just joking around and didn\u2019t expect him to react so violently. With some embarrassment, he rubbed his nose and said in a small voice: \u201cI didn\u2019t know that you minded. Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s heart was beating at a very fast pace and, like this, he could no longer go back to sleep. He decisively turned over to get out of the bed and left for the bathroom without a word.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu sat cross-legged on the bed watching him. Despite originally feeling a little unhappy after being yelled at, the moment he saw Jiang Yang\u2019s red ears and his gradually reddening neck, he couldn\u2019t help but curl his lips up into a smile. His mood had improved significantly, and he even felt very pleased. He raised his head while scratching his face and, after thinking about something, he let out a low chuckle.</p><br/><p>Soon afterwards, Qin Xu also jumped off his bed. He gently whistled a cheerful tune as he made his way into the bathroom and stopped next to Jiang Yang who stood before the sink. While they brushed their teeth together, their eyes occasionally made contact through the mirror. Seeing this, Qin Xu pulled a few faces, but it was all ignored by Jiang Yang. After spitting out the foam, Qin Xu once again stretched his arm out past Jiang Yang\u2019s shoulder to reach for his towel on the rack. As he grabbed for it, he deliberately leaned in and made it seem like he was holding Jiang Yang in his embrace.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt very uncomfortable. He could feel Qin Xu\u2019s breath on the back of his neck and he couldn\u2019t help but stiffen up and shuffle over to the side.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu noticed this and deliberately acted calm as he retracted his hand but, at an angle where Jiang Yang could not see his face, he secretly smiled.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>It felt like school had just started yesterday but time had flown by and, in a blink of an eye, the semester break was here. The student\u2019s impression of semester breaks could be said to be very complicated. Despite being able to get red envelopes during new year\u2019s, before that they would need to tackle the dreaded final exams.</p><br/><p>Study slags busily tried to cram last minute while top students did they best trying to figure out how they could get as many marks as they could. In an instant, the learning atmosphere at the school was at its peak.</p><br/><p>However, they would still go to the school store to buy food to replenish their energy in between classes.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu stood up and naturally bowed his head down to ask Jiang Yang next to him, \u201cWhat do you want to eat? I\u2019ll buy for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t even think and replied: \u201cSame as you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled and proceeded to walk out of the classroom with Xie Zhe and the others. Not long after he returned, Huang Shao followed the scent of food and came over. Seeing that Qin Xu had bought food for Jiang Yang, he chewed on dried seaweed and commented: \u201cYour relationship is really good now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang noticed the sly look in his eyes and wasn\u2019t happy to see it. In one movement, he shoved food into his mouth to block it up and subconsciously retorted: \u201cGood your ass.\u201d</p><br/><p>If he was told this a few times, Jiang Yang could just ignore them and treat it as them seeing wrong but after it was mentioned multiple times, he slowly realised \u2014\u2013 Am I really close with Qin Xu? Good relationship? Is it all because of the system?</p><br/><p>If it was him in the past, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to deny it but now, hearing the other people mention it, he couldn\u2019t help but hesitate first before denying it unnaturally. The tone used to deny it also didn\u2019t sound very convincing.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang mulled over this as he reached over to take out a pocky stick and casually start chewing on it.</p><br/><p>Chocolate flavoured. So sweet.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

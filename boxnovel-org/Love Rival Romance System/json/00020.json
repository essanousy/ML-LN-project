Without even sparing a glance in his direction, it walked forward elegantly and with posse.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was very curious and reached out wanting to touch it. The little white cat shrank its body and very agilely avoided his hands. Qin Xu persisted and continued to reach out. The little white cat tensed its body and looked at him vigilantly ready to attack at any moment. It let out a high-pitched scream and bared its sharp teeth while lashing out preparing to bite his hand. Qin Xu didn\u2019t panic and instead laughed. He toyed around with the cat quite happily.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked on helplessly and then looked back across the street. He asked: \u201cThey\u2019re gone. Are you going to continue following them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu stretched his fingers over to the cat and tried to scratch its neck while avoiding its claws. He absentmindedly responded: \u201cNot following.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was a little surprised. He stood next to him and watched him tease the cat.</p><br/><p>After a moment of teasing and unsuccessfully catching his hand, the cat seemingly got bored and turned away. Qin Xu shrugged his shoulders, stood up, and put his hands behind his head while concludingly saying, \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Jiang Yang was suspicious. After being tricked once, he didn\u2019t trust his words completely the second time.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s eyes met with his suspecting gaze. He chuckled as he hooked his arms around his shoulder, \u201cReally. Let\u2019s go. Daddy will buy you your oranges now. Don\u2019t be so angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The blue veins on Jiang Yang\u2019s forehead protruded out. He shook his shoulders wanting to shake off his arms but Qin Xu only gripped onto him harder and clung ummovingly onto him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang tried a few more times and, seeing that it had no effect, he could only give up. He turned around to ask: \u201cWhat do you plan to do? Give up? Are you upset?\u201d</p><br/><p>He said those words partially to mock him and also partially to demonstrate concern.</p><br/><p>He could feel Qin Xu\u2019s arm on his shoulder stiffen for a moment. Qin Xu looked down at the floor and kicked a stray stone away. Watching it fly a short distance ahead, he casually answered: \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken. How can I not be upset? I\u2019m upset to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing his childish behaviour, he didn\u2019t take his exaggerated words to heart. Jiang Yang knew that he only had some good feelings towards her and is probably feeling a little sad but could not be considered too extreme.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Qin Xu asked in return.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s mood was even calmer, \u201cI had some good feelings towards her because she helped my sister before so it\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu rolled his eyes, \u201cAnd yet you still try to sabotage me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang snorted: \u201cI don\u2019t like seeing your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu said emotionally: \u201cThat\u2019s too much. If you didn\u2019t get in my way then I might have already gotten together with Wu Tong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang instantly shot him down: \u201cThat\u2019s impossible. The two of you are complete opposites. It\u2019s almost like beauty and the beast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Beast? Hearing his looks criticised, Qin Xu felt very unhappy. He quickly shoved his face before Jiang Yang\u2019s wanting him to take a closer look, \u201cDo I look like a beast?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Jiang Yang slapped away the face that almost touched his nose. With a look of indifference, he explained: \u201cNot appearance-wise. I\u2019m saying that you two don\u2019t belong in the same world. She is a good student and you are a slacker who smokes, fights \u2013 everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu pouted. He then thought of something and, with his chin resting on Jiang Yang\u2019s shoulder, he stared across at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang at this moment wanted to use all his strength to push him away but his actions were interrupted by is sudden words \u2014 \u201cBased on what you said, you think that I am not worthy of such a good girl. Since you are similar to me, are you actually saying that to yourself? Low on self-esteem?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s hand that had moved to push his arm away stopped mid-air. He looked at him in disbelief, \u201cLow on self-esteem? Me? Are you really okay in your head?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu directly ignored his denial and proceeded to lift his hand to his head and ruffle it up. He smiled while saying coaxingly: \u201cDon\u2019t be sad. In daddy\u2019s opinion, you are very good. Although you have a bad temper, curse a lot and like to get angry every day, you still have some cute parts. If I were Wu Tong, I would definitely choose you. You have to be confident. There\u2019s still plenty of fish in the sea~\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was annoyed to the point that his face became red with anger. He forcefully pushed Qin Xu away but Qin Xu was like mud \u2013 he quickly slipped away and looped his hand around his shoulder again from his other side. He even continued to tease him: \u201cYour face is nice, wide shoulders, narrow waist, long legs and even a perky butt. You really shouldn\u2019t feel so inferior~\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said those words, his eyes even moved over to his ass and gave it a deep look.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang instantly exploded, \u201cWhat are you looking at!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu chuckled, \u201cWhat are you blushing for? I didn\u2019t even touch it. Don\u2019t be so shy~\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was even further enraged. Without a thought, he threw a punch and, as expected, it was blocked. This time, he took the opportunity to move behind Qin Xu and hooked his strong arm around his neck from behind. With a firm grip, he leaned in and said beside his ear threateningly: \u201cI dare you to continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the deadly threat said beside his ear and with his neck also being pressed down onto to the point that he had some difficulty breathing, Qin Xu naturally knew that he shouldn\u2019t continue teasing him. He instantly accepted his wrongdoings and asked for mercy, \u201cI won\u2019t say it, I won\u2019t say it. I was just joking. You\u2019re not blushing. You are the manliest man ever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang snorted coldly. He hadn\u2019t even applied much strength and this guy already started begging for mercy. What a loser. After hooking his arm around his neck for a while longer, he eventually loosed his grip and prepared to let go.</p><br/><p>But what he didn\u2019t expect was that Qin Xu was waiting for this exact moment.</p><br/><p>As soon as he relaxed his grip, Qin Xu instantly seized the chance and turned around to grab his collar and pushed him up against the wall behind them. He then pushed his knee in between his legs and, in an instant, all his limbs were restrained. Bending his head down, he smiled down at him with his eye bright.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was surprised for a moment. He stared up at him expressionlessly and said with slight contempt, \u201cLet go.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Qin Xu laughed: \u201cBeg me. If you listen to me, this daddy here will buy you oranges to eat~\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang gritted his teeth. Looks like he couldn\u2019t out of this anymore. Seeing that he was the one who mentioned it first, he regretted it to the point that even his intestines turned green. If he could go back in time, he swore that he would definitely not mention oranges.</p><br/><p>Unlike Qin Xu who can change his attitude at any time, Jiang Yang is too stubborn and reluctant to swallow his pride to beg the other party. He would much rather continue struggling while he is pressed against the wall. With their eyes meeting, he displayed no signs of giving up.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu naturally also knew about this. After pressing him down and teasing him for a while, he released his grip and flicked his earlobe, \u201cYou really don\u2019t like to lose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang glared at him and wanted slap his hand away, but Qin Xu quickly dodged his attack after flicking his ear. Missing his hand, he could only rub his ears impatiently and send him a kick.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu once again dodged his attack by jumping back and threw him a smile, \u201cAren\u2019t you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at him coldly and proceeded to stride ahead and walk past him. He no longer wanted to give him anymore of his time.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu is taller than him and his legs were also longer. From behind, in just a few steps, he quickly caught up. He walked next to him while asking jokingly: \u201cAngry? Xiao Yang Yang~\u201d</p><br/><p>Being called this by Huang Shao already made Jiang Yang feel disgusted and now that he heard it coming from his mouth, the effect of it naturally increased several folds. Goosebumps appeared all over his body and his scalp went numb. Jiang Yang glared at him: \u201cDon\u2019t call me that. Get lost!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Qin Xu tilted his head. His dark and deep eyes sparkled with curiosity. \u201cIs this the loving nickname that only Huang Shao can call you by? Speaking of which, is get lost a swear word? Do I need to tell your sister about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang pursed his lips tightly. He pushed away that annoying smiling face while saying through gritted teeth: \u201cLeave!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was pushed away but he wasn\u2019t angry. Instead, he smiled even more brilliantly. Raising a hand and resting it on his shoulder he responded: \u201cOkay~ Let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two teenagers continued to bicker as they walked side by side down the road towards the sunset and the shadows that fell behind them gradually grew longer and longer.</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong></p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: This person is too annoying!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: How? I\u2019m only like this to you. Do you want to take a look at my fragile heart? =3=</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang coldly and indifferently cut your heart with a knife,</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: Sob sob sob~ QAQ</p><br/>\n</div>"}

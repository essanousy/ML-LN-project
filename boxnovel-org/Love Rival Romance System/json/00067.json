I\u2019ll help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>This naturally was a good opportunity for the boys to show them their good side.</p><br/><p>As for Wu Tong and He Shuo, it was a different scenario. With his tall and strong build, He Shuo had a troubled look on his face while he scratched his head. He said in a small voice: \u201cI also can\u2019t\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tong smiled very gently and held onto his hand, \u201cI can. I\u2019ll teach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Shuo\u2019s face blushed red as he cutely nodded his head in agreement.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu watched the two standing close together and snorted internally. What a strong stench of love in the air.</p><br/><p>He then decisively turned around and hooked his arm around Jiang Yang\u2019s shoulder. He acted pitiful and said: \u201cI also can\u2019t. You have to help me later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang gave him a look, \u201cWhat help do you need? You\u2019ll learn how to do it very quickly on your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu thickened his skin and continued to look over at him, \u201cBut I really can\u2019t. Not possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had a look of disdain, but he still took Qin Xu\u2019s hand and helped guide him around while they skated.</p><br/><p>There was a moment in the middle of it when Jiang Yang heard a cry of surprise from next to him and this was followed by the feeling of someone grabbing tightly onto his waist. Jiang Yang almost lost his balance and nearly fell backwards from this impact but was held tightly in that person\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cScared me to death. I almost fell.\u201d The words \u2018scared\u2019 came out of Qin Xu\u2019s mouth, but there was an obvious smile in his eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked down at Qin Xu\u2019s skates and could tell that he had just skilfully stopped right in front of him. He could tell that this bastard could not only skate, he was even better than he is himself. Thinking this, Jiang Yang felt like he was just being teased and was instantly angry. He angrily threw off his hands and, no longer wanting to care for him, he proceeded to skate away.</p><br/><p>But Qin Xu refused to let go. Jiang Yang managed to escape from his arms several times, but Qin Xu\u2019s movements were fluid and he easily moved back to Jiang Yang\u2019s side and even reached out to hold his hand.</p><br/><p>With his hand grabbed onto so suddenly and the obvious body temperature transmitted to his palms, it was impossible to ignore.</p><br/><p>For a moment, Jiang Yang inexplicably felt his heart beat increase. Before he had the chance to think about this, he reflexively reacted by throwing off Qin Xu\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t manage to control his strength well and Qin Xu was pushed backwards by the force. Seeing him almost fall backwards onto the ground, Jiang Yang reached out without a thought to once again grab onto his hand and pull the other person back. With one person pulling and supporting the other, it looked like they were in the middle of a waltz.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had reacted with subconscious panic but when he looked back up, his eyes were met with Qin Xu\u2019s eyes that had a hint of a smile. There wasn\u2019t any indication of fear from the fall earlier so Jiang Yang instantly realised the he was once again played with.</p><br/><p>This time, in addition to feeling angry, there was also some inexplicable panic and irritation inside. Because of this, his tone was quite rude as he glared at Qin Xu and said seriously, \u201cYou think this is funny?! Will you still be able to laugh after you fall and get cut by the blades?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu seemingly didn\u2019t expect him to get so angry. After being stunned for a moment, he proceeded to laugh amicably and once again stuck onto Jiang Yang while holding onto his hand, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I was wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing it spoken with a spoiled child\u2019s tone, Jiang Yang would normally just let him off like before but for some reason, this time his expression remained cold. He didn\u2019t want to waste any more energy on Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang said faintly: \u201cI don\u2019t want to skate. Going to take a break.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then with a couple of smooth steps, he skated over to the rinks exit and walked over to the rest area before sitting down.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu naturally followed and stuck firmly behind him. He wasn\u2019t upset about being suddenly yelled at. On the contrary, he was actually quite happy. He didn\u2019t immediately realise it earlier but after a moment of consideration he realised why Jiang Yang reacted so strongly. To put it bluntly, Jiang Yang was worried about him but as someone who is extremely proud, he couldn\u2019t express his concern properly.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong took He Shuo around the ice rink and, while teasing his cute junior brother, he also noticed the situation on their side. Seeing them leaving for the rest area and Qin Xu following behind Jiang Yang while saying something that managed to bring a smile to his face, he couldn\u2019t help but express: \u201cThese to really\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He Shuo leaned against the railing next to him and looked over in the direction that he is looking at and couldn\u2019t help but pout: \u201cWho are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tong heard the tone of dissatisfaction in his voice and turned over to meet his tensed expression. He laughed and said: \u201cI\u2019m looking at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Shuo was instantly embarrassed. His eyes were stained with sparkling colours appearing very dazzling and beautiful, and his ears were red.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he was in a good mood to skate and even reached out to hold Wu Tong\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the time was almost up, the group slowly started to leave the rink and change their shoes before heading over to the amusement park entrance.</p><br/><p>When Wu Tong walked out, he saw Jiang Yang standing under a tree outside the entrance to the ice-skating rink waiting for the others. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh meaningfully. Jiang Yang who saw this felt uncomfortable and frowned, \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang knew his secret, so Wu Tong naturally didn\u2019t need to continue acting. He just said straightforwardly, \u201cNothing. I just thought that you two are so silly and cute. Before, you both mistakenly thought that you liked me but it\u2019s not too late to correct it back now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liking Wu Tong was a black history of his that Jiang Yang didn\u2019t want to admit to but what did he mean but correcting it back? Jiang Yang furrowed his brows in confusion.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong continued with a smile: \u201cBefore, you were love rivals but how does it feel now that you two are together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang noticed something wasn\u2019t right, \u201cTogether? What are you talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tong as a matter of factly said: \u201cYou and Qin Xu of course\u2026.Wait. Don\u2019t tell me you two aren\u2019t official yet? Not official yet already so clingy?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, a familiar expression formed on his face. Ah, so greasy.</p><br/><p>But right now, that wasn\u2019t important.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s expression suddenly became complex. There were many things that had happened recently that he couldn\u2019t explain but, after hearing Wu Tong\u2019s words, he started to think over it carefully. In fact, he had not been unaware of it the whole time. It was just that he had subconsciously avoided it. The obviously burning gazes from Qin Xu\u2019s eyes that often flashed brightly were not the type of look one would give their ordinary friends. Furthermore, he is also very clingy.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was a little shocked. He said in a soft voice, \u201cYou think that, Qin Xu and I\u2026..are a couple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tong returned with a question: \u201cOtherwise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was stunned.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the classmates who had fallen behind finally came out while chattering and laughing. The moment Qin Xu came out, he looked left and right, and his eyes naturally brightened the moment it found Jiang Yang. Without any hesitation, he strode over to where he is.</p><br/><p>His figure was tall and straight, and on his face was a radiant smile.</p><br/><p>This type of person, no matter where he is, is very eye-catching but he didn\u2019t pay attention to the gazes from the on-lookers and only cared about going over to Jiang Yang. It was as if he only had Jiang Yang in his eyes. He smiled very happily as he grabbed onto Jiang Yang\u2019s and walked next to him</p><br/><p>As for Jiang Yang, all he could see was Qin Xu\u2019s extremely intimate gestures. Acting spoiled, he moved closer and rested his chin onto Jiang Yang\u2019s shoulder and said a few things in a lazy manner. Despite the words spoken being rather mundane, his mood seemed especially good.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt his ear itch from his breath and it unconsciously started to turn red but wasn\u2019t because he was embarrassed. It was just a natural physical reaction.</p><br/><p>He suddenly had a strong realisation that something wasn\u2019t right with the way they interacted with each other. It was too intimate, and they would very often hug and cling. What was surprising was that he had even grown accustomed to it and felt that it was normal.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at the classmates around them. Not one of them found it strange for the two to be in such an intimate position. It was as if it was completely normal.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu softly whinged: \u201cThere\u2019s still some time left and it\u2019s boring standing around like this. Let\u2019s take a few photos.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he didn\u2019t wait for Jiang Yang to agree and had already handed his phone over to one of their classmates asking them to help them take a photo.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu ran back and pushed Jiang Yang over to stand under the iconic symbol for the amusement park. With one hand around his shoulder and the other hand displaying a victory sign, his smile was brighter than the sun itself.</p><br/><p>The classmate pressed the button a few times and then signalled an okay with his fingers. Then, like a diligent photographer he directed the two: \u201cChange your pose and we\u2019ll take a few more. Make a heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now this posture is something that has been very popular amongst social media. Without even needing to think, Qin Xu reached out and squeezed his two fingers together for form a small heart.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t like taking photos and for a moment didn\u2019t respond until Qin Xu patted him on the shoulder. He subconsciously squeezed his two fingers together and accidently made the giving money hand gesture.</p><br/><p>Both Qin Xu and the classmate taking the photo laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled in a very pleased manner as he grabbed onto Jiang Yang clumsy little hand and corrected his gesture before saying: \u201cIt\u2019s like this baby.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was spoken like he was coaxing a little child.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was a little annoyed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang pursed his lips and, throwing his hands off, he turned around wanting to leave.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu saw this and immediately cursed internally. He could tell that he had once again said something wrong and triggered the other person, but he didn\u2019t regret calling Jiang Yang that. Instead, he felt particularly sweet and pleased inside. Moreover, Jiang Yang\u2019s angry look is very cute.</p><br/><p>Qin (with the eyes of a lover) Xu seemingly had a powerful filter in his eyes. No matter what he did, Jiang Yang always looked very good to him and he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to fight back if someone said otherwise.</p><br/><p>He hobbled over to Jiang Yang and tried to placate him with a smile. He said a bunch of nice things and even from time to time threw out a few cheesy lines that made Jiang Yang feel his scalp go numb. A little helpless, he reluctantly walked back to take the rest of the photos so that he could finally make Qin Xu shut up.</p><br/><p>When the classmate returned his phone back, Qin Xu happily held onto his phone and swiped through the photos one by one. Jiang Yang also looked at it briefly when he noticed\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>The two were both wearing their school uniforms and, when it was taken with several classmates, it looked like a group uniform but when it was just the two together smiling at the camera it looked like a couple outfit.</p><br/><p>Couple outfit.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, Jiang Yang felt inexplicably guilty and a little complex inside. His heart also seemingly skipped a beat.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was complimenting him, and he got scolded instead. And so, he vented his frustrations on the system, \u201cSee that? That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying that your tasks are useless. You should give it up. You are not suitable for this. You need to rely on your sincerity when you are trying to become friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>He had already started so he did all that he could to try to discourage that stupid system of his.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it looked like the system didn\u2019t notice his intentions at all and only felt that his host this time is hard to deal with \u2013 one of the worse that it\u2019s ever had!</p><br/><p>The system strived its best to maintain its cool: \u201cThe task is completed. Congratulations.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was dissatisfied: \u201cNo rewards with completion but punishments if failure to complete it. Isn\u2019t this too unfair?\u201d</p><br/><p>The system\u2019s response was also filled with nonsense: \u201cFriendship. Isn\u2019t that the best reward that you can get? It is more precious than priceless treasure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu who is used to speaking nonsense with his own mouth found himself covered in goose bumps with his sudden exposure to nonsensical talk from someone else.</p><br/><p>He commented insincerely. \u201cWhat you said really makes sense. I beeeep\u2014\u2014-\u201d</p><br/><p>Following that was a series of curses that were censored out. Qin Xu was momentarily amazed. He didn\u2019t expect that the system would also have such a function.</p><br/><p>The system said faintly: \u201cSwearing is wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026..\u201d Retributions always came fast, and Qin Xu finally experienced the grievances Jiang Yang had suffered through.</p><br/><p>Time had passed unknowingly and soon it was the end of class. Based on his calculations, Qin Xu estimated that he still had about twenty minutes until he could talk and decided that he should use this time to concentrate on playing his game on his phone. He was thankful that the teacher didn\u2019t ask him to answer a question otherwise he could only cough a few times and write an explanation on his workbook to explain that he had a cold and couldn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>The system suddenly spoke up: \u201cRandom task: Please share the biscuit with Jiang Yang. Time limit of one minute. If you fail, the voice change penalty will be extended to 24 hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Again.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was cursed internally as he bit onto a Pocky stick but, to avoid that voice potentially ruining his handsome image, he pushed his bag of Pocky over to Jiang Yang\u2019s side and indicated for him to take some.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang glanced at him. With his gaze gradually becoming filled with more confusion, he shook his head, \u201cNo thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>But because of the time limit, Qin Xu didn\u2019t give him the opportunity to refuse. Without a word he pulled one out and forcefully stuffed it into Jiang Yang\u2019s mouth. Jiang Yang was not prepared for it and could only stare at him dumbfoundedly with the Pocky in his mouth.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Qin Xu lifted the corners of his lips and smiled as if he was saying \u2018You\u2019re welcome\u2019.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was speechless but since the biscuit was already in his mouth he could only accept it. Without using his hands, he chewed onto the Pocky stick and, little by little, it became shorter and shorter. That appearance of his looked like a little hamster gnawing on melon seeds.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, it was pretty cute.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu watched him and thought this.</p><br/><p>In fact, Qin Xu\u2019s opinion of the system is similar to that of Jiang Yang\u2019s. Their degree of resentment towards the tasks wasn\u2019t very intense. Compared to that, they were more annoyed at the fact that they were commanded around to complete the tasks. They preferred being able to act on their own without the need to be directed around.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was forcefully fed the biscuit but since his taste is similar to Qin Xu\u2019s, he naturally didn\u2019t hate it. He just felt that something was wrong with Qin Xu and was momentarily making fun of him. He glanced at him momentarily before going back to what he was doing.</p><br/><p>Until the bell indicating the start of class rang, Jiang Yang remained expressionless and ignored him. After harassing him several times and even getting a scolding after passing him a paper note, Qin Xu couldn\u2019t help but suspect that Jiang Yang was annoyed at him and wasn\u2019t in a good mood. In the past, he would deliberately provoke Jiang Yang and, since he did it out of his own will, he didn\u2019t mind but this time it was because of the system and he felt extremely wronged. Thinking for a while, he decided to try and explain his situation.</p><br/><p>On a paper note he wrote \u2014- You might not believe this, but I was forced to do those things earlier. I\u2019m starting to doubt science.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at those two sentences that had no context behind it and couldn\u2019t understand what he was trying to say.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu gritted his teeth and decided to write system onto the paper but, despite clearly being able to write properly earlier, he suddenly felt as if he was manipulated by a mysterious force and instead drew a series of scribbles. It was extremely strange. He frowned and proceeded to write something else only to find that he had returned to normal.</p><br/><p>To think that there are actually restrictions like this!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang saw that he was scribbling on the paper and felt certain that he was just joking around. He laughed at himself for temporarily suspecting that he knew something and proceeded to look back at the blackboard.</p><br/><p>However, no less than a minute later, a fluffy head moved over to him and whispered: \u201c\u2026..The system forced me to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s eyes widened, and he quickly turned to look at him only to see Qin Xu\u2019s equally surprised face. Qin Xu didn\u2019t expect to find that that he could actually say it.</p><br/><p>But, almost at the same time Jiang Yang also noticed his strange voice. After a moment of daze, he tried to best to suppress his laugh and asked, \u201cYou, what happened to your voice?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he asked this, Qin Xu became very annoyed. He muttered: \u201cIt\u2019s all because of that stupid system\u2026.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>The two leaned towards each other and quietly conversed but the teacher on the podium naturally isn\u2019t blind. He immediately smiled and pointed out Jiang Yang and then Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou two, come up and answer these two questions.\u201d</p><br/><p>He swept a look of warning at the two whose faces were close to the point that it almost touched. They instantly shrank back and obediently walked up to the podium to pick up the chalk.</p><br/><p>There were three questions on the board, so the teacher also randomly picked out a girl. It just happened that the girl was someone who had a crush of Jiang Yang and many of the fellow students who knew about this giggled when they saw this.</p><br/><p>The girl was originally quite calm but the moment she heard her classmates\u2019 giggles, she couldn\u2019t help but feel a little shy. She walked up to the podium slowly and stood next to Jiang Yang before picking up a piece of chalk. Turning her head, she could see the side profile of the handsome young man. The corner of her lips curved up as she looked down in embarrassment.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was also laughing and was doing his best to suppress it. After hearing that arrogant guy\u2019s voice change so dramatically and discovering the fact that he may also know something about the system, he felt very excited. He couldn\u2019t wait till he could finally clear things up.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu stood next to him and naturally could see that he was trying to suppress his laughter. He also knew that he was laughing at him, but he couldn\u2019t speak and felt extremely wronged. He could only stubbornly use his eyes to glare at him. The moment Jiang Yang remembered that voice of his, he didn\u2019t find his glare ferocious at all. Instead, all he could think about was Minions and their cute antics.</p><br/><p>The teacher who watched from one side could no longer restrain himself: \u201cThat\u2019s enough you two. Stop looking at each other so lovingly at the podium!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of the students sitting on the first row said with a small voice: \u201cTeacher, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re using that phrase correctly\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong>Teacher: Of course, I know that. I deliberately said that to tease those two! Qin Xu &amp; Jiang Yang: \u2026\u2026Should we tell the teacher that he is actually right?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

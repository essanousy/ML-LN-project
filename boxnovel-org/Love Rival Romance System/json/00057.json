After going through all the procedures, they sat in the waiting area playing on their phones.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu picked out a few of his favourite photos, typed a sentence and then sent it to his friends. His words were filled with bragging.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t take long for his friends to like and respond.</p><br/><p>\u201cXu brother, how can you do this? You didn\u2019t even invite me!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere did you go? Thailand?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, you\u2019re not blind! Xu brother is favouring hoes before bros. Now that he has a wife, he has completely forgotten about us brothers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFFF Inquisition! Let\u2019s release the seal and let out the hell of fire!\u201d</p><br/><p><em>(KKnotes: Reference to the anime Baka to Test. https://bakatotest.fandom.com/wiki/FFF_Inquisition)</em></p><br/><p>\u201cWhat does the above mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s nothing. It\u2019s just the reaction of those who don\u2019t like to eat dog food wuwuwu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those loser friends of his sent out many complaints under his post. There was even someone who would said that he would buy tickets and join them soon. Seeing this, Qin Xu responded: \u201cI\u2019m waiting for the return flight now. Didn\u2019t want you guys to bother the two of us so I didn\u2019t post anything until now.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you guys see that? Qin brother is clearly discarding us!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo shit! I\u2019m not blind!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Aren\u2019t they on their way back? We must prepare them a big gift!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t think that us single men have no dignity. Even if laozi starves to death, I won\u2019t eat your dog food!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang returned from the bathroom and saw Qin Xu looking down at his phone with a very wretched smile on his face. Seeing this, the corners of his lips couldn\u2019t help but twitch and he also noticed that there weren\u2019t any vacant seats around him.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu looked up and immediately patted his thigh enthusiastically: \u201cCome, sit here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had long become accustomed to Qin Xu\u2019s habit of randomly spouting flirtatious and teasing words. He just rolled his eyes and used his foot to lightly kick the back of his foot to get him to move over and make room for him. The seats at the airports were spacious. Even if one person sat on it, they would still have plenty of room. Jiang Yang advantage of this and squeezed into the space next to Qin Xu before taking out his phone to play games.</p><br/><p>Now that Jiang Yang had returned, Qin Xu was no longer interested in his phone. With his eyes drawn over in Jiang Yang\u2019s direction, he lazily leaned over and rested his chin onto Jiang Yang\u2019s shoulder and watched him play his game.</p><br/><p>Sitting opposite them was a young girl chatting with best-friends on WeChat. The moment she looked up and saw two handsome boys in front of her, her eyes instantly lit up and she quickly typed the words: \u201cI just saw two super handsome brothers! Lucky to the MAX!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her best-friend was naturally interested. She asked excitedly for the girl to show her.</p><br/><p>The girl secretly raised her phone and wanted to take a sneak-shot but unfortunately, she didn\u2019t have the talent paparazzi reporters had. Her expression was too unnatural, and she was acting too nervous, so she was immediately noticed by Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu could feel someone\u2019s gaze coming from the seats opposite them and subconsciously looked over. He noticed the girl\u2019s little movements but didn\u2019t get angry. Instead, his lips hooked up into a smile and he silently shook his head. He then continued to stick to Jiang Yang and intimately said a few words. The warm breath could be felt on Jiang Yang\u2019s neck and ear making him feel an uncontrollable itching sensation. Jiang Yang trembled slightly and made a mistake in the game causing the enemy to deliver a fatal blow to his character. His blood drained instantly, and the character turned into a corpse on the floor that other players would occasionally step over.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang irately shook his shoulder, \u201cFuck. You made me die!\u201d</p><br/><p>After he said this, he angrily turned his back over to Qin Xu. Their seat just happened to be the seat at the very end so with Jiang Yang turning around both his legs are now under the arm rest and his long legs hung from the edge of the chair. With pursed lips and a look of dissatisfaction, he directly ignored Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu rubbed his nose and understood that he was on the losing end, but he didn\u2019t like Jiang Yang ignoring him. He thickened his skin and shuffled over to obediently apologise and act cute.</p><br/><p>With the two leaning so close to each other, the scene looked extremely intimate and pleasant.</p><br/><p>The girl sitting opposite them was secretly watching them and couldn\u2019t help but blush. She felt that the handsome brother earlier wasn\u2019t actually smiling at her and was just in a good mood because of the other handsome brother sitting next to him. Seeing him look at the other brother with such warm and endearing eyes, their relationship is so good\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>The girl couldn\u2019t help but sigh emotionally.</p><br/><p>When the plane finally descended, and they saw the familiar scenery, they felt like they had returned. No matter how beautiful and how much fun it was overseas, they would sooner or later start missing the food back at home.</p><br/><p>When they got off the plane they immediately called a ride. They then collected their luggage and headed directly to the car park to find the driver.</p><br/><p>After half an hour, they were to go back to their own homes.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu looked over at Jiang Yang. The school break is different from when they had classes and they would not be able to see each other every day. Thinking this, he felt that attending class was no longer that annoying. Thinking that they would soon separate, Qin Xu felt a little disappointed and was unwilling to part. He thought this even though he had spent more than a week alone with Jiang Yang. It appears that this experience had actually made him greedier.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu sighed: \u201cI wish school would hurry up and start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was a little tired after the flight and sat lazily in the back seat. He glanced over at him, \u201cAre you crazy?\u201d Who would actually wish for the break to finish?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled and didn\u2019t respond. Instead he raised his hand over to the Jiang Yang\u2019s neck and gently pushed him over to his side, \u201cTired? I\u2019ll lend you my shoulder to lean on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang indeed was quite sleepy. He didn\u2019t worry about being polite and proceeded to lean on his shoulder while yawning. His eyes slowly blinked a few times before it gently closed, \u201cWake me when we\u2019re there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk.\u201d Qin Xu replied with a smile.</p><br/><p>The scenery outside the car window continued to speed past but Qin Xu didn\u2019t want to get home so quickly. He preferred if they went slower and it would be even better if they encountered more red lights.</p><br/><p>But in the end their destination still got closer and closer. Qin Xu had wanted to wait until the car had stopped to wake Jiang Yang but before they arrived, Jiang Yang seemingly became aware of it and woke up in a daze. He rubbed his eyes a few times, looked out the window and saw that they were almost there so he proceeded to sit up while yawning.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu could still feel the remnants of Jiang Yang\u2019s body heat and weight on his shoulder as a hint of disappointment flitted through his eyes. He felt that Jiang Yang had woken up too early.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang sensed the burning gaze from the person next to him and subconsciously looked over. He rubbed the corners of his mouth and was only able to breath a sigh of relief when he confirmed that he had not drooled. He then asked calmly: \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu however just shook his head and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang thought that he was acting strange and looked at him for a few more seconds before soon throwing it to the back of his mind and proceeding to look back out the window and yawning again. Once he\u2019s home, the first thing that he\u2019s going to do is to sleep.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The winter break was originally quite short. Only a few days after they had returned from their trip, it was time for school to start. Seeing their classmates again, they had the complex feeling of both familiarity and unfamiliarity. However, with just a few words, they easily caught up with the happenings over the break.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang sat quietly in his seat while eating snacks. Compared to the others, he and his desk partner didn\u2019t have that sense of distance between them caused by the winter break. They had gone travelling together and even played games with each other everyday after that, so they were pretty much constantly in contact. The next time they saw each other, they were all too familiar with each other, so they didn\u2019t need to ask each other what they had done over the break.</p><br/><p>Moreover, with the presence of the system that would from time to time appear and give them tasks to go and hang out with each other, they couldn\u2019t refuse getting into contact with each other. Jiang Yang occasionally found it a little strange how Qin Xu seems to get very frequent but also very trivial tasks. It was even several times more often than the tasks he would receive. Fortunately, he had grown accustomed to it.</p><br/><p>Today they would go out together to buy clothes, tomorrow they would go watch a movie together and then have dinner outside\u2026.and so, Jiang Yang really didn\u2019t feel like he hadn\u2019t seen Qin Xu for a long time and instead felt that he had seen him too often to the point that it annoyed him.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu returned from filling up the water bottles and returned with two bottles in his hands. Of the two, one of it was obviously Jiang Yang\u2019s. He placed it down at the corner of his desk and, seeing his soft, dark hair through the corner of his eyes, he couldn\u2019t resist the urge to reach over and ruffle it a bit.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked up at him but didn\u2019t give his thanks. Instead he found things suspicious. He suddenly leaned over such that his face was very close to Qin Xu\u2019s and assessed his expression carefully while asking suspiciously: \u201cOne who is unaccountably solicitous is hiding evil intentions. Did you do something bad? Or is your brain broken?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu didn\u2019t expect him to come over so suddenly and couldn\u2019t help but shocked for a moment. He then calmed himself down and deliberately acted nonchalant while shaking his head, \u201cNo. I just did it because I was doing mine anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then pretended to be sleepy and laid on his desk. He buried his face inside his arms while trying to conceal his rapidly reddening face and rising temperature. He gritted his teeth and complained to himself in a small voice: \u201cFuck! How can you suddenly come up so close to me?! That\u2019 s cheating! Scared me to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Usually, Qin Xu would be able shamelessly stick to Jiang Yang and do all kinds of intimate actions to Jiang Yang while still being able to talk to him normally. But, if Jiang Yang was to suddenly get up close to him when he\u2019s unprepared, he couldn\u2019t help but panic slightly and be unable to be calm.</p><br/><p>His heart pounded extremely rapidly in his chest and the blood rushed around to his limbs like crazy. He could even fell the pounding at his scalp and he felt like he would sooner or later explode from all the blood rush.</p><br/><p>He waited for a long time before he managed to calm himself down.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu once again acted clingy. Like he was holding him in his embrace, he hooked his arm around Jiang Yang\u2019s shoulder and watched him play his games. He would even occasionally pick up the chocolate sticks next to him and bring it over to Jiang Yang\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was concentrating on his game when he felt that there was something to eat by his mouth. He naturally opened his mouth and bit onto it. The chocolate stick hung outside his mouth and slowly shortened little by little as he chewed onto it. In an instant, he was done, and Qin Xu would hand over another one.</p><br/><p>One feeding and one eating, the scene looked extremely pleasant.</p><br/><p>The other classmates watched on and no longer found that scene strange. They just thought \u2014\u2014 With the winter break, it looks like their relationship had gotten even better.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

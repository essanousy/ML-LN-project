If he wanted to be late, then so be it. He wouldn\u2019t care if he has trouble trying to find the classroom by himself later.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang threw off Qin Xu\u2019s arm and headed over to the balcony to do his laundry.</p><br/><p>The spoiled child who was reluctant to shower earlier quickly froze up. He looked over at Jiang Yang with wide eyes and quickly attached himself to him while asking cautiously: \u201cAre you angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang ignored him and did not respond.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu immediately revealed a bitter expression. He started panicking: \u201cYou\u2019re really angry\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>That pitiful appearance and those red eyes\u2026It looked like he would start crying the next second.</p><br/><p>When Jiang Yang saw this, he could feel a headache coming. Why didn\u2019t he realise that Qin Xu had a hidden cry-baby attribute before? It really drove him crazy!</p><br/><p>As Jiang Yang looked at him, tears started welling in his eyes. It was as if he would soon start crying a river.</p><br/><p>\u201cStop.\u201d Jiang Yang said in a cold voice.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu immediately pursed his mouth tightly. He stared with his eyes wide open as he tried to hold back his tears. This look of restraint only made him look even more pitiful and Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but feel like the villain.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu pouted and looked at him pitifully. Tears swirled around in his eyes but, because he was afraid that Jiang Yang would be annoyed by it, he did his best to suppress it. He said cautiously: \u201cI\u2019ll go shower so can you not be angry at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t agree, it looked like he would be stared at like that for the rest of his life. Jiang Yang felt uncomfortable being started at and could only stiffly nod his head.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu finally broke into a smile. Wiping away his tears, he picked up his clothes and obediently went into the bathroom to take a shower.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang stood before the sink and looked down at the water basin in front of him as he let out a sigh of relief. He felt that the present Qin Xu was scarier than before. He couldn\u2019t yell at him or fight him and if he got angry, he would cry! He really didn\u2019t know how to deal with this!</p><br/><p>Returning back to the dormitory room after washing his clothes, Huang Shao excitedly came over and asked: \u201cXiao Yang Yang, what happened between you and Qin Xu? Why is he acting so strange? Did he lose a bet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang immediately recalled the reason for Qin Xu\u2019s change; the failed task. Could his tone-deafness be the cause? Qin Xu also didn\u2019t teach him well and only yelled at him so he also has partial responsibility for it okay?!</p><br/><p>He frowned unhappily and suddenly patted Huang Shao\u2019s shoulder. He picked up his phone and said: \u201cLet\u2019s play a few games.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao had not played games with him for many days and he was naturally very eager.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang immediately casted several moves and mercilessly killed his character over and over again.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang smiled and asked: \u201cAre you still curious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that deep and meaningful smile, that terrible look, Huang Shao who saw this couldn\u2019t help but feel the hairs on his back stand. He quickly shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t want to know. I don\u2019t want to know at all. Even if you force me, I definitely won\u2019t listen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was speechless. Who was the one who wanted to know earlier?</p><br/><p>After playing a few games, his mood had improved.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao quickly left the room and left Jiang Yang alone to wait for Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>When he came out of the bathroom, he came out in a rush and had not even put on his top. Holding onto his waistband and with his hair still dripping wet, he rushed out and breathed a sigh of relief when he saw that Jiang Yang was still there.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang saw this appearance of his and irately said: \u201cPut on your shirt. Dry your hair.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d Qin Xu nodded his head and clumsily put his head through his shirt. The water on his hair couldn\u2019t help but make his shirt wet.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t watch this any longer. He took a deep breath and said: \u201cWhere\u2019s your towel?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu pointed to the washbasin in the sink on the balcony where a towel dripping with water laid.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang sighed internally. No longer able to hold himself back, he knocked onto Qin Xu\u2019s head and then angrily headed over to grab his towel. After squeezing it dry, he threw it over Qin Xu\u2019s head and roughly dried his hair. Very quickly, his hair was half dry, but it had also become a bird\u2019s nest.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu wasn\u2019t angry at all and, instead, he was quite happy. He smiled at Jiang Yang and revealed a small canine. It was a silly and cute expression and he looked completely harmless.</p><br/><p>\u201cThank you~\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s expression stiffened and all the annoyance inside him disappeared in an instant. Feeling very uncomfortable, he subconsciously looked away. He pretentiously coughed a few times and said with a cold expression: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be late. If you don\u2019t hurry up, I\u2019ll head off first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu heard this and immediately panicked. He ran over to his wardrobe to find his socks and then hurriedly wore his shoes. As he tied his shoelaces, he was afraid that Jiang Yang would leave him behind so he constantly looked up to check.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt helpless, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you. Wear your shoes properly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..Oh.\u201d Qin Xu responded but he still couldn\u2019t help but sneak glances at him. Despite trying make his actions a small as possible, it was still very obvious. He would have to be blind if he didn\u2019t notice it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang shook his head and a small smile form on his lips without he himself even noticing.</p><br/><p>Leaving the dormitory, Qin Xu once again became very clingy and his hand quietly reached out to grab onto Jiang Yang\u2019s shirt.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt the movement, looked back at him and stared silently.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu quickly held his breath and in anxious manner, he looked back at him with doe-like black eyes. It was as if he was afraid of being rejected.</p><br/><p>A moment later.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang expressionlessly turned back and continued moving along as if nothing had happened. He directly ignored Qin Xu\u2019s little actions.</p><br/><p>On the way to the teaching building, the sky had already darkened so the path was illuminated by several street lamps. The two walked along it together in the dimly lit environment. If they walked closely together, it wouldn\u2019t be obvious that Qin Xu was holding onto his short so Jiang Yang just chose to let it go after a moment of hesitation.</p><br/><p>But as they neared the teaching building and stepped into the bright moonlit field, there were still several students hanging around the stairs in front of the building. Jiang Yang didn\u2019t hesitate to pry off Qin Xu\u2019s hand and, ignoring his sad expression, he ruthlessly continued walking ahead to class.</p><br/><p>Qin (pitiful) Xu could only sigh and follow him closely from behind.</p><br/><p>Evening self-study class.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was fortunate that they came to class late because as soon as they arrived, the class bell rang and there wasn\u2019t a chance for anyone to go up to Qin Xu to talk. Like this, they were able to avoid exposing Qin Xu\u2019s amnesia. It\u2019s just that after losing his memory, Qin Xu had become difficult to deal with. Normally he would just concentrate on his homework or play on his phone but tonight he enthusiastically tried to find excuses to talk to Jiang Yang. From time to time he would use his elbow to nudge Jiang Yang and then pass small paper notes over with nonsensical questions written inside.</p><br/><p>The already irritated Jiang Yang lost his patience. He grabbed Qin Xu\u2019s shirt collar and pulled it towards him. Glaring at him coldly, he gave a word of warning: \u201cDon\u2019t bother me. Otherwise I\u2019ll beat you up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was suddenly pulled over and, with such a big movement like that, the chair he sat on also scrapped against the ground creating a harsh scraping sound. For a moment, the whole class heard this sound and turned around to look at the source.</p><br/><p>They all took a deep breath in \u2014\u2014- Your mum. Don\u2019t tell me they\u2019re about to start a fight?</p><br/><p>What they didn\u2019t know, however, was that the moment Jiang Yang said those threats, Qin Xu\u2019s tears instantly started flowing out. With his eyes all red, he looked extremely pitiful. This scared the life out of Jiang Yang and all the anger inside him was scared away.</p><br/><p>Fuck.</p><br/><p>Because this look of his couldn\u2019t be seen by the others, Jiang Yang instinctively pushed his head down and forced him onto the table. He didn\u2019t control his strength well and ended up slamming his head. The other students saw this and grimaced. Although they didn\u2019t know how Qin Xu was, they could tell that it must\u2019ve been very painful from the sound alone.</p><br/><p>As for the culprit, Jiang Yang felt his eyebrows twitch from guilt. With a dark expression, he glared at the classmates who quickly turned back and resumed working on their homework.</p><br/><p>Like this, Jiang Yang finally had the opportunity to check on Qin Xu. He hesitated for a second and reached out to pat him on the shoulder. He whispered: \u201c\u2026\u2026Hey, you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu had long started sobbing wordlessly in his arms with his body shuddering with every breath.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang sighed helplessly. His hand stiffened mid-air and, while licking his lips, he uncomfortably patted him on the shoulder while apologizing awkwardly: \u201cLook up. Let me take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>After becoming silent for two seconds, Qin Xu slowly lifted his head from within his arms. His forehead had turned red and his eyes were filled with tears. It was as if it was just washed with water and that clear, child-like appearance of his made people seeing it unable to deliver a blow. But the fact is, Jiang Yang did just that and it wasn\u2019t exactly a light blow. Luckily, Qin Xu is quite sturdy, so his forehead only became red and a bump did not form.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang thought that he was crying from the pain, but Qin Xu was actually upset about Jiang Yang disliking him, treating him coldly and even hitting him. Thinking this, he felt particularly wronged and tears continuously flowed out.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang naturally did not know how to coax another person. He patted him a few times and slowly retracted his hands. He then pulled out two candies out and said stiffly: \u201cDon\u2019t cry. Is it okay if I apologise?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu tightened his lips, looked up at him with a clear pair of dark eyes adn then reached out to take the two toffees. Like a small animal storing their winter food, he buried himself back into his arms. His arms moved slightly, and Jiang Yang guessed that he was probably opening the candy wrapping.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he accepted it, Jiang Yang thought that it was probably a good sign and that his mood had recovered.</p><br/><p>But as it turned out, Jiang Yang\u2019s thoughts were too na\u00efve, too simple. How could something as simple as two toffees be able to placate a spoiled child like this?</p><br/><p>Just as he breathed a sigh of relief, a small note was pushed over to his side. The words written on it were of the familiar, elegant handwriting but the words\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cCan I sleep with you tonight?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang inside: \u201c\u2026\u2026..?!!!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

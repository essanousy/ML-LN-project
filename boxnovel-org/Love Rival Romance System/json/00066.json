At this moment Huang Shao was extremely dense and didn\u2019t think that anything was wrong. He awkwardly laughed and said something to boost his own courage: \u201cIt\u2019s actually not that scary. These are just some fake probs haha\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he noticed that Director Wang was not paying any attention to him, he even thought that he was still angry from being dragged into this by Huang Shao. He quickly conceded and admitted to his mistake, \u201cSorry Director Wang. I couldn\u2019t find a partner, so I had no choice but to drag you in. It\u2019ll be over very soon. It won\u2019t take much time.\u201d</p><br/><p>But the person next to him remained silent.</p><br/><p>Their surrounding was too dark, and Huang Shao couldn\u2019t see the director\u2019s expression clearly. He lifted his phone and used the light to shine over. When he saw the directors pale and grim expression he asked, \u201c\u2026\u2026.Director?\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh no. Looks like he\u2019s really angry.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao worried over whether he would be punished with another reflection essay as he continued forward with a guilty conscience. He did so to show the director his determination not to waste his time.</p><br/><p>On the ground in the corner was a severed limb. With one glance, you would have thought that it was just a prop used to help generate the creepy mood in the building so Huang Shao didn\u2019t pay it much attention. He carefully walked around it and continued ahead.</p><br/><p>Behind him, Director Wang followed mechanically as if he had lost his soul. Suddenly, the arm moved and grabbed onto his ankle.</p><br/><p>\u201cAhhhhhhhh!!!! Gho-ghost!!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao was scared to death by the sudden scream. He turned his head around with disbelief and saw that it had actually come from Director Wang.</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector\u2026\u2026you\u2019re afraid of ghosts?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao was both shocked and confused. He stood stunned for a long time before thinking that he should do something. He tore off the hand at his ankle and patted the director\u2019s shoulder in reassurance while also in a complicated mood: \u201cDirector, this is all fake.\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Wang however was still immersed in his own world and didn\u2019t process any of what he had said.</p><br/><p>At this moment, another \u2018ghost\u2019 appeared from the corner. His whole body was covered with dirt and blood as well as grotesque scars.</p><br/><p>Director Wang was even more terrified. He retreated back in such a fast motion that the hand holding his phone used to illuminate his path lost its grip. The beam of light bounced from wall to wall as the phone fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>The \u2018ghost\u2019 agilely took two steps forward and bent down to pick up the phone on the ground. Under the illumination from the phones light, he revealed a pale and ghastly smile along with a sharp laughter that made those hearing it feel their hair rise.</p><br/><p>He waved the phone to indicate his desire to return the phone back but how could the director have the guts?</p><br/><p>The \u2018ghost\u2019 is a staff after all and his job was to scare the guests so even while returning a phone, he should maintain his scary demeanour. Thinking this, he bent down his body and swayed his body around like a ghost while he moved closer to the director.</p><br/><p>The director hurriedly waved his hand, \u201cI don\u2019t want it! Shoo! Shoo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ghost: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d A look of helplessness.jpg</p><br/><p>The \u2018ghost\u2019 tried to move forward several times but seeing that the guest was extremely terrified, he could only silently put the phone back onto the floor. He then swayed a few times and slowly drifted back into the darkness.</p><br/><p>There wasn\u2019t much that could be said about the remainder of their journey through the haunted house. Throughout the whole way, the director constantly screamed in fear. That rough screaming voice of his made some \u2018ghosts\u2019 cover their ears in agony while complaining \u2014\u2014- I think you\u2019re the scary one instead!</p><br/><p>Huang Shao originally had thought that the director was extremely brave and had never expected this reaction from him. Rather than saying that he has the trump card, Huang Shao\u2019s original fear level of 60% had been raised to 120% because of this partner of his. When the female ghost in the red dress climbed out, he was even scared to tears!</p><br/><p>This haunted house is really worthy of its name. Every team that had entered it was scared to death.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and Qin Xu were naturally not exempt from this.</p><br/><p>It was just that these two liked to act tough and were pretty good at acting. Clearly trembling to the point that their legs quivered as they looked down the dark corridor, they stubbornly maintained a taunt expression and acted indifferent. They were determined not to lose to the other party as they felt that it would be too embarrassing.</p><br/><p>With this determination, the two walked in with a look filled with bravery and confidence. Unfortunately, their faces were slapped no less than five minutes after they entered.</p><br/><p>From around the corner, a \u2018ghost\u2019 suddenly jumped out and scared them to death.</p><br/><p>It rushed over towards them and, unprepared for this, the two didn\u2019t know where to run.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and Qin Xu, in perfect coordination, proceeded to run in the same direction. In their panicked state, they tripped over each other\u2019s foot and even brought the \u2018ghost\u2019 down along with them. Together, they fumbled around all over the ground.</p><br/><p>Luckily, the staff had experienced all sorts of situations during his time working in the haunted house so, only after a short moment of daze, he quickly got up and resumed playing his role.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was still on the ground and had no chance to escape. He could only quickly wave his hand, \u201cGo! Don\u2019t come over!\u201d</p><br/><p>It could be said that it was very pathetic.</p><br/><p>Mr Ghost rushed over and grabbed onto Jiang Yang\u2019s sleeve. With such realistic costume makeup, it was even more terrifying seeing the ghost from up close. Jiang Yang felt the hairs on his scalp rise and desperately tried to escape. Like a snake shedding its skin, he quickly turned his body around and slipped out of his jacket.</p><br/><p>The \u2018ghost\u2019 holding the loose jacket in its hand: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d After the phone earlier, now it\u2019s a jacket? Today has been very fruitful.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and Qin Xu were too busy running away and naturally didn\u2019t see Mr Ghost\u2019s distressed sigh.</p><br/><p>They clung onto each other\u2019s hands tightly and slowly advanced forward. Suddenly, they could hear the sound of a baby crying. It was a very miserable cry too.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu licked his lips and felt his scalp go numb, \u201cWhy are they playing a baby crying. It\u2019s too scary okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was also shaking but the moment he heard those words, he rolled his eyes. Nonsense. They\u2019re obviously using it because it is scary. How can it be considered a haunted house if it\u2019s not scary?</p><br/><p>After walking further down, Qin Xu felt his muscles tire from being tensed up the entire time. He didn\u2019t know what terrible things were awaiting them ahead and, for a moment, he didn\u2019t want to proceed.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yang Yang, let\u2019s take a break.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he said this, Jiang Yang had already proceeded to sit down while gasping for air. He had clearly not done much exercise but beads of sweat coated his forehead.</p><br/><p>Sitting with his legs spread open on the ground and his hands resting on his knees, he roughly wiped away the sweat from his forehead. After throwing away his jacket, he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little cold when the wind blew past.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou regret this right?\u201d Qin Xu turned his head over and laughed at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang rudely glanced at him, \u201cWhat is there to regret? You should speak for yourself. Terrified.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not terrified?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAt least I\u2019m better than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu snorted very obviously in disapproval.</p><br/><p>They wanted to sit on the ground and continue chatting comfortably while they caught their breath but how can the \u2018ghosts\u2019 let them do as they wanted? Each team had a limited time, so they shouldn\u2019t stay in the haunted house for too long.</p><br/><p>The ghost from further up ahead no longer waited for the two to reach his location and took the initiative to come over and scare them first. With strong ferocity and wretched expression, it started running over to them.</p><br/><p>How could Jiang Yang and them just sit there? They obviously made a dash for it! While running, they would occasionally glance back to check whether the ghost was still chasing after them. Like this, they ran like crazy for a very long time and the ghost still didn\u2019t\u2019 fucking stop chasing after them!</p><br/><p>\u201cThat ghost is way too dedicated! He\u2019s still chasing us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu complained that he was tired, but he didn\u2019t dare to stop. While gasping for air, he heard the footsteps behind him slow down. He guessed that the ghost might have reached the end of the section that he is responsible for and will probably stop chasing them, so he also started slowly down. Unfortunately, as if he was suddenly stimulated, the next second the ghost started another fierce chase.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d Running to the point that he almost wanted to vomit blood.</p><br/><p>Finally, the ghost behind them was gone and the two could move on at a normal speed. They bypassed the severed hand prop and continued walking for a while before Qin Xu suddenly cursed: \u201cFuck, why aren\u2019t we at the exit yet? Did we go the wrong way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was too lazy to talk. He just rolled his eyes and thought, don\u2019t jinx it.</p><br/><p>But the next second.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt a tug at his shirt and subconsciously looked back to find himself facing a disfigured face at a very close distance. It even fucking revealed a polite smile?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang almost couldn\u2019t control his hand and wanted to punch it but Qin Xu managed to pull him back away from the ghost with a look of vigilance.</p><br/><p>But the ghost didn\u2019t have any intention to approach them. Instead, it reached it\u2019s hand out and pointed to the passage on the other side.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe wants us to go there?\u201d Jiang Yang frowned and asked.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201cProbably, but I don\u2019t really trust him. Who knows whether or not they have a trap set up for us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that the two didn\u2019t have any intention to move, it again pointed it\u2019s finger to the passage.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026.I think we should trust him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang nodded.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu stuck to Jiang Yang and together they walked a head. When he looked back, he saw the ghost waving his hand politely to say goodbye. Your mum, Qin Xu quickly faced forward again, that scene was just too shocking.</p><br/><p>And then, they encountered the female ghost in the red dress that climbed out of the cabinet.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu shouted with fear and anger: \u201cI told you that ghost was deceiving us!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang trembled and his heart beat extremely fast. Unfortunately, there is only one set path through the haunted house and they wouldn\u2019t be able to reach the exit unless they went through all the obstacles.</p><br/><p>The ghost in the red dress laughed crazily as she rushed over towards them. Because the corridor was so narrow, they didn\u2019t have anywhere to hide and could only watch her get closer and closer with their own eyes. Qin Xu covered his face and embarrassingly cried: \u201cNo, I\u2019m about to go crazy! Do you want to make me wet myself?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The female ghost suddenly stopped and snorted. It wasn\u2019t the laughter that you would hear from the recorded sound effects and it was instead a normal laugh from the staff. After snickering for a moment, she gently floated away.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026..She was laughing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang nodded: \u201cYes. Laughing at how pathetic you are.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu didn\u2019t want to lose: \u201cYou\u2019re not much better than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>And so, for the remainder of the way Qin Xu held tightly onto Jiang Yang\u2019s waist. Jiang Yang wanted to throw his hands off, but he very shamelessly said: \u201cI\u2019m very scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, the last ghost chased them out the exit. When they finally saw the light, it was like they felt alive again. They leaned against the wall while catching their breath and internally swore that if they decided to go to a haunted house again, they will be considered a dog.</p><br/><p>Under the tree stood the other people who had exited the attraction before them, and they clearly looked no better than them. Everyone of them was also chased out of the building.</p><br/><p>Everyone gathered to discuss their experiences and, when they discovered that the others also had similar experiences, they felt a little better about themselves. Luckily, it wasn\u2019t just them that was scared.</p><br/><p>What was interesting was that Tang Ling Ling and Huang Shao\u2019s group actually ran into each other when they were halfway through the building. They had thought that they had encountered a ghost and screamed loudly for a moment before realising that the voice sounded a little familiar. After looking carefully, Huang Shao that guy who was already scared to the point of tears by the female ghost earlier was crying like a baby and even had snot flowing out from his nose. He complained: \u201cWho told you not to be in a team with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite clearly being terrified, the moment she saw Huang Shao Tang Ling Ling didn\u2019t know whether to cry or laugh.</p><br/><p>As for the whole endeavour, the only person who could do it without a change in his expression was the master, Wu Tong. He pretended to be scared only so that he could use that opportunity to get closer to He Shuo. Although the others may not be able to tell, Jiang Yang and Qin Xu could tell with one look that he wasn\u2019t scared at all. Otherwise, how could he calm back down so quickly?</p><br/><p>After personally seeing how terrifying the haunted house is, they looked over at Wu Tong who could go through it without a change in his expression and couldn\u2019t help but complain \u2014\u2013 He\u2019s a devil. A devil.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

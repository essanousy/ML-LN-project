You and me? Hehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu pretended to act upset: \u201cWhat? What era is it now, yet you still discriminate against homosexuality? You don\u2019t support freedom of love?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang frowned and subconsciously refuted: \u201cOf course that\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how can you speak of the class leader that way? He is being open-minded.\u201d Qin Xu explained sensibly, \u201cThink about all the same sex couples overseas and think about Wu Tong and the junior brother. Doesn\u2019t it seem pretty normal?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWell\u2026\u2026\u201d Why does he feel like he is falling into a trap?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt that something was off but seeing Qin Xu\u2019s serious expression and hearing his persuasive words, he temporarily found himself agreeing with him and become unable to refute it.</p><br/><p>Before he was able to fall into thought, Qin Xu had already shifted the topic. He said to Xiao Yuxin: \u201cClass leader you should go. Jiang Yang\u2019s shirt is wet, so I will accompany him back to the dormitory to change.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he was done saying that he turned and left. Since Jiang Yang had a distance limit with him, although he didn\u2019t know how far the limit is, he didn\u2019t want the earlier incident to happen again, so he quickly followed behind him. This left Xiao Yuxin standing there alone in daze \u2014\u2014 Shirt is wet? Why is it wet? Why do you need to accompany him back to the dormitory to change clothes?</p><br/><p>Qin Yuxin couldn\u2019t help but internally cry out those three consecutive questions. He originally didn\u2019t think much of it but now he had uncontrollably imagined a variety of situations.</p><br/><p>They returned to the dormitory and, because it was also pretty late, he decided to also wash up. After washing up, he walked out while drying his hair and picked up his phone that he had left on Xiao Yuxin\u2019s bed. His slender fingers swiped over the screen and he didn\u2019t notice Qin Xu looking at him with interest from the bed opposite him. As if he was trying to test something, he deliberately moved and increased the distance between himself and Jiang Yang. This action of his was also done particularly fast.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang instantly felt a pulling force behind him. Like a spring, the further you pull, the more force you create. In a blink of an eye, like a magnet, Jiang Yang was pulled into Qin Xu\u2019s arms and he fell into his lap.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu however very naturally reached out and looped his arms around Jiang Yang\u2019s waist.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was stunned. Feeling the warmth behind him, he suddenly felt his scalp go numb. Without even thinking, he wanted to jump off but before his butt could leave a few inches, he was pulled back by a pair of arms around his waist.</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d A voice travelled over the top of his head. Qin Xu seemed to be in a pretty good mood?</p><br/><p>He continued: \u201cI\u2019ve figured out how it works.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Jiang Yang\u2019s attention had shifted over, he loosened his grip and made Jiang Yang sit on his bed. He then slowly retreated away from Jiang Yang. As the distance between them widened, the force pulling them also increased. After about three steps, Jiang Yang had already involuntarily stood up and walked over to him.</p><br/><p>At this moment Qin Xu took a step forward and actively shortened the distance between them. Even though there was still some force there between them, with some effort, Jiang Yang was able to stand firm and regain his balance.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you feel it? It\u2019s like a game turned into reality.\u201d Qin Xu\u2019s eyes were sparkling. Under the lights, it looked particularly dazzling.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the only person who saw this didn\u2019t respond very enthusiastically. He looked at him with dead-fish eyes and asked: \u201cYou think this is funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu temporarily had a bad feeling and his back went cold. Although he didn\u2019t know what he was going to do next, he subconsciously said: \u201cCalm down\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then watched Jiang Yang quickly take a few steps backwards and consequently he felt a strong force pulling him from his chest. He was forced to fly forward towards Jiang Yang\u2019s outreached arms, as if flying straight into a trap. Without hesitation, Jiang Yang used one hand to grab onto his shoulder and the other reached for his neck. With a dark smile: \u201cIs it funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang stood against the wall and against the sunlight. With his face half concealed with shadows, there was a threatening air around him. Using the limitations set by the punishment from the systems, he managed to take advantage of it and capture the other person.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu blinked and couldn\u2019t help but find him a little handsome</p><br/><p>Qin Xu laughed awkwardly: \u201cHaha. Don\u2019t you feel like one of those villains in cartoons? The ones that would raise their hand and say under my command, let the doors to hell open\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>He tilted his head and chuckled slightly in attempt to placate him</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang remained silent and did not respond. He only continued to stare at him.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2026..So pitiful. It\u2019s so scary when it\u2019s so quiet. Can\u2019t you just respond a little? Master, you\u2019re a little scary.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you loosen your grip? I\u2019m about to die from suffocation.\u201d Qin Xu grabbed onto Jiang Yang\u2019s wrist and smiled as he tried to pull it off his neck.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang did not respond. He felt that he didn\u2019t use much strength, but he still unconsciously loosened his grip. With a cold scoff: \u201cServes you right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu naturally felt his grip loosening and his lips unconsciously curved up. He laughed, and, without a warning, he reached out to tickle Jiang Yang\u2019s waist. He wanted to use the chance when Jiang Yang is distracted to escape and move back, preferably far enough for him to take advantage of the magnetic force between them.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Yang reacted very quickly and didn\u2019t let him succeed. He leaned forward and started attacking him at close range using both his hands and feet. The moment the distance shortened, when they were almost touching chest to chest, the force between them was almost non-existent.</p><br/><p>They fought very brutally.</p><br/><p>System number 1 lamented: \u201cThis punishment is for the sake of improving their relationship. With them like this\u2026\u2026should we try to placate them?\u201d</p><br/><p>System number 2 responded very indifferently: \u201cWhat are you afraid of? They\u2019re just communicating through their fists. Isn\u2019t fighting is a small step towards friendship?\u201d</p><br/><p>System number 1: \u201cIs that so\u2026\u2026\u201d It was still confused.</p><br/><p>When Huang Shao and Xiao Yuxin returned, they came onto the scene of the two wrestling around and subconsciously wanted to stop them. However before they went ahead, they noticed that something wasn\u2019t right. The two weren\u2019t fighting with all their might and were actually just playing around.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang noticed them through the corner of his eyes and pushed Qin Xu away in disdain: \u201cGo shower.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d After being in contact with me for so long, you\u2019re only complaining that I\u2019m dirty now?! Explode into a pufferfish!</p><br/><p>However, now that their roommates had returned, it wasn\u2019t good to continue fighting. He picked up his bathing supplies and sent a glance in Jiang Yang\u2019s direction. Jiang Yang understood the meaning behind it in less than a second and proceeded to pick up his phone and walk over to the balcony to avoid being to far away from Qin Xu in the bathroom.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao looked at them strangely but didn\u2019t say anything. However, he couldn\u2019t help but sneak glances at them several times.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang leaned against the railing as he concentrated on playing his game and didn\u2019t pay attention to anything else. He suddenly felt a pull, and this was followed by a splat sound coming from the bathroom. It sounded like the sound of someone slapping their hand onto something. Jiang Yang frowned and walked over to knock onto the door: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Come closer to me. I nearly fell to my death.\u201d</p><br/><p>While he was washing up he suddenly felt a force and slipped. Luckily, he reacted quickly and managed to regain his balance.</p><br/><p>Although he really wanted to complain about the system\u2019s ruthlessness, at this moment Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><br/><p>From the other side of the door, Qin Xu naturally heard it as well. He asked in an annoyed tone: \u201cYou\u2019re laughing?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang openly lied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI heard it!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you say I did, then I guess I did.\u201d Jiang Yang responded nonchalantly as if he was trying to placate a spoiled child.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Just you wait!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang raised his eyebrows, \u201cI see. Then I better leave not to avoid getting hit.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu could imagine the embarrassing state he would be exposed in if he did that: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.Don\u2019t leave!\u201d</p><br/><p>In the room, Huang Shao chewed on a biscuit as his eyes constantly moved over to the balcony. He shuffled over to Xiao Yuxin\u2019s side and whispered secretively: \u201cXiao Xin, don\u2019t you think that those two are a little strange?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin looked up from his book and sighed. He felt particularly uncomfortable unable to speak out his thoughts but, for the sake of his friend, he strictly kept his mouth closed. He could only pat Huang Shao\u2019s shoulder and say with a heavy tone: \u201cYou\u2019ll understand when the time comes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d What is this?! Why does he suddenly feel like he just asked his parents how babies are made?!</p><br/><p>Because they couldn\u2019t be too far away from each other, Jiang Yang and Qin Xu went to the cafeteria together for dinner. Jiang Yang naturally was too lazy to give him too much attention. Pursing his lips and expressionlessly, he walked ahead. But even if he didn\u2019t want to talk, it didn\u2019t mean that Qin Xu would stay quiet and not joke around.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu walked next to him and, with a grin, he looped his arm around Jiang Yang\u2019s shoulder, \u201cWhat do you plan to eat Xiao Yang Yang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that name, Jiang Yang felt his scalp go numb and he felt particularly uncomfortable. He couldn\u2019t help but turn back to give him a look. He couldn\u2019t understand how he could call someone like that without feeling disgusted. Wanting to shake his arms off, Jiang Yang shook his shoulders, but Qin Xu was like gum; the moment his arm falls off, it would soon stick back on.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang answered vaguely: \u201cDon\u2019t know. I\u2019ll decide when I get there\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hesitated for a moment and, not wanting to be the only one feeling uncomfortable, he retaliated and called back, \u201cXiao Xu Xu.\u201d Yup, with this his arms felt numb and goose bumps formed all over it.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu raised his eyebrows and was only a little surprised. He then laughed very naturally and rubbed his chin with great interest, \u201cHey, it\u2019s surprisingly not bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>His ability to peak nonsense was amazing! Jiang Yang frowned. It was a futile attempt and he only ended up disgusting himself!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu saw Jiang Yang\u2019s annoyed expression and couldn\u2019t help but bow his head down and snicker. Hearing himself being called in such a cheesy manner, he obviously wouldn\u2019t not have any reaction. However, after stiffening for a moment, he thought that it sounded somewhat nice?</p><br/><p>For the sake of convenience, after the two entered the cafeteria they lined up in the same line for braised fish. Jiang Yang swiped his card and didn\u2019t leave straight away. He stood by and waited somewhat cautiously. He ensured that he didn\u2019t stand too far away from Qin Xu to avoid being forced to fall onto Qin Xu. Getting himself dirty was one thing but it was more frustrating being unable to have the braised fish. Because of Qin Xu he didn\u2019t manage to have it earlier this year but this time he wouldn\u2019t let the same thing happen again.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu also carried his tray and swiped his card. They then went together to get their utensils. Jiang Yang walked at the front and grabbed two of each to avoid wasting time. He turned back and said to him: \u201cI got yours too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was stunned for a moment before his lips curved up into a smile. He placed his hand on Jiang Yang\u2019s shoulders and stretched a finger out to point while slightly brushing against his chin, \u201cThere are seats there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps because he was too hungry or perhaps he was afraid of spilling his soup if he tried to shake off his hand, Jiang Yang didn\u2019t mind Qin Xu\u2019s intimacy this time. Without a word, he walked in the direction pointed out by Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>The two sat down to eat and just when Jiang Yang wanted to enjoy his food in peace, the person sitting opposite him didn\u2019t have the intention to let him do so.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu bit onto his chopsticks and eat a piece of the fragrant braised fish. He suddenly spoke up: \u201cActually, with us getting along like this, it\u2019s not bad?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s response was an eyeroll. Getting alone? Did this guy forget that they had just had a fight earlier in the dormitory?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu also added: \u201cI think we can become good friends. I find you pretty pleasing to the eye. Really. Anyway, we both don\u2019t want to be controlled by the system. Why don\u2019t we try a few things from our end and do our best to accept each other? Like this, the system might disappear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu frowned as he felt a little conflicted: \u201cIsn\u2019t this what the system wanted?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m saying that we should just give it a try. We could do what we want instead of being forced by the system. Until now, all the system has been doing is restricting our actions. They can\u2019t control our thoughts and our feelings. If I like you then I like you. The same applies if I hate you. There won\u2019t be any changes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang mulled over this for a while and felt that it sounded reasonable, but because he had always opposed him, he naturally wouldn\u2019t agree to his suggestion so easily. He wanted to say something but when he looked up he was met with Qin Xu\u2019s sparkling eyes and momentarily was at loss for words.</p><br/><p>This was something Qin Xu had done intentionally; pretending to act all innocent and harmless. After the amnesia punishment he had learnt of a new method to deal with Jiang Yang. Although it was fun when they fought and bickered, it actually wasn\u2019t a bad idea changing his approach every now and then.</p><br/><p>Also\u2026\u2026..Jiang Yang\u2019s stunned look is very cute.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

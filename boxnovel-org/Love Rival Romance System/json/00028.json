Although it may have sounded strange to the others, as if they were doing something that couldn\u2019t be mentioned, it was something that they had to do. How could Jiang Yang have the courage to go to the other persons place alone and pretend to be him? He wouldn\u2019t even know which room is his and where everything is placed. Not knowing such things, he would definitely be exposed within minutes.</p><br/><p>In the end they decided to go to Qin Xu\u2019s place. Jiang Yang prepared an excuse in advance and asked Qin Xu to give his parents a call to explain that he would stay at his classmates place this weekend and would not go home.</p><br/><p>Father Jiang and mother Jiang both trusted their son and very quickly agreed. They asked if they should speak to the other parents or bring a gift to show appreciation but with Jiang Yang\u2019s urge Qin Xu said: \u201cMum don\u2019t worry. I\u2019m just going to Qin Xu\u2019s place to play. If we\u2019re too formal, it\u2019ll only make them uncomfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing Qin Xu\u2019s name, father Jiang and mother Jiang thought it sounded familiar but momentarily couldn\u2019t recall where. In fact, they had heard their daughter Jiang Yuan mention his name when she shared various gossip about her school over dinner. She casually mentioned that her brother is a famous character at school and, together with another male student, they are referred to as the school idols. Unfortunately, their relationship wasn\u2019t too good.</p><br/><p>To avoid Huang Shao gossiping about it after finding out them living together for the weekend, they even purposely swapped with the students on duty today and allowed Huang Shao, Xie Zhe and the others to head home first.</p><br/><p>After a simple clean, they packed up and prepared to head home together.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang subconsciously grabbed his own bike, but Qin Xu threw him his keys while saying: \u201cThere are still classmates at school. You should use mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thinking that it was reasonable, Jiang Yang went over to the other bike. Qin Xu\u2019s bike wasn\u2019t hard to find. The most eye-catching one is naturally his; a red and gold bike with flame patterns on the side.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang stepped onto the pedal and accelerated for a moment while enjoying the breeze. It is in a man\u2019s nature to love cars. Unfortunately, they are still underaged and could not drive and could only ride bicycles. With a good and expensive bicycle like this, Jiang Yang felt the wind whistling past his ears and felt very exhilarated.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu led the way and they entered the gates to a complex. Jiang Yang cleared his face from expressions and brought Qin Xu, the original resident, in as a visitor.</p><br/><p>They locked up their bikes and walked in.</p><br/><p>A notification sound rang from Qin Xu\u2019s pocket and Qin Xu proceeded to pull his phone out. He glanced at the screen and, as if he had just recalled something, he looked back at Jiang Yang with bright eyes.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Suddenly, he had a bad premonition.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang leaned back, dodging his look of expectation and raised his alertness. It definitely wasn\u2019t something good.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Qin Xu smiled and said: \u201cLet\u2019s have a quick discussion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang resolutely shook his head: \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu ignored this. He stepped up and looped his hand across his shoulder enthusiastically: \u201cI haven\u2019t finished. It\u2019s actually very simple, a very small thing. Someone as domineering as you should be able to get through it in a blink of an eye.\u201d</p><br/><p>He stretched out two fingers and tried to convince him, \u201cThis is something I had made an appointment for since a while ago and it must be done tomorrow. It\u2019s just getting a couple of piercings; very quick. I already have the earrings prepared.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang heard this and immediately frowned. He mercilessly rejected him, \u201cNo. Impossible. Not negotiable.\u201d</p><br/><p>On his face was a disdainful expression. It was clear that he was wondering why a man would want to get something as sissy as earrings.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu didn\u2019t agree with this. There are plenty of men in the world who wear earrings like Beckham and McGrady. How are they sissy? With earrings, they became even more handsome and sexy!</p><br/><p>He casually listed a long list of names and sounded very persuasive. Jiang Yang looked at the pictures and had to admit that it really did look manly and not girly. But\u2026.Jiang Yang continued to shake his head resolutely.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Qin Xu as dissatisfied.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201cIf you want to get a piercing you can go ahead and do it when we get our bodies back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu however said: \u201cThat shop is run by my brother\u2019s friend. The earrings are all designed and made by him and a piercing doesn\u2019t hurt. I only managed to get my brother to buy me a pair after convincing him for a long time. If I miss this chance, I might not be able to do it in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang scoffed, \u201cWhat does that have to do with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu made a bitter expression and looked up at him pitifully but Jiang Yang remained expressionless and continued walking ahead.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy love for you is limitless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, deafening loud music started playing and Jiang Yang who was not prepared for it was surprised to the point that he missed a step and fell forwards. Thinking that he would definitely fall flat onto his face, he squeezed his eyes shut but he felt himself falling onto a solid chest.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked up and saw Qin Xu\u2019s smiling face, \u201cYou okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu saw that he was about to fall and before his brain could think, his body had already moved over to catch him. Unfortunately, he reacted a second to slow and ended up falling onto his butt, acting like a cushion.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Jiang Yang was dazed for a moment, but he quickly recovered his expression back into a frown. He silently climbed up, patted the dirt off his palms and reached out while saying faintly: \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu reached out without any hesitation and grabbed onto his hand. He stood up but, because of inertia, his body leaned forward and he his face almost fell onto Jiang Yang\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>From not far away, a dancing aunt apologised for scaring everyone and said that it was because she didn\u2019t adjust the volume properly. She saw two young men on the ground and quickly asked: \u201cChild, did you break anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu looked over and shook his head coldly. He then turned back to Jiang Yang and said with a smile: \u201cSince I saved you, rather than entrusting yourself to me, why don\u2019t you help me get that piercing? What do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at him and said with a helpless look, \u201cOn a biological level, it could be said that I saved you. My body is on the bottom acting as the cushion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu hooked his arm over his shoulders. His dark eyes sparkled as if there were crystals inside and he continued to insist, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say that. Since you you\u2019re not willing, then you can entrust yourself to me and I will reluctantly accept.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang rolled his eyes: \u201cGet lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet a piercing or entrust yourself to me. You choose one.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t choose any of it.\u201d Jiang Yang didn\u2019t fall for it and resolutely refused. He even looked at him with a slight look of disgust, \u201cDon\u2019t use my face to make such a wretched expression.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu heard but didn\u2019t listen. He immediately placed his hands under his chin and blinked shamelessly while acting cute. Since it wasn\u2019t his own face, he didn\u2019t feel any pressure doing this. He even wanted to take photos of it. \u201cPlease~\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t look straight at him and wanted to slap his face aside.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu guessed his thoughts and reminded him: \u201cThis is your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>He reduced the strength in the hand that he had already stretched out and lightly patted his face.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu felt proud. He even sidled up to him and used his palm to rub his face while blinking.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d He really didn\u2019t want to see this. He refused to admit that this idiot here was someone he had hated with all his guts before.</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong>Qin Xu: Calling mother-in-law CHECK \u221a We\u2019re progressing so quickly =v= Hurry and praise me, praise me~</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/love-rival-romance-system-chapter-27-press-down\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 27 - Press Down\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/love-rival-romance-system-chapter-29-ear-piercing\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 29 - Ear Piercing\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"474748\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

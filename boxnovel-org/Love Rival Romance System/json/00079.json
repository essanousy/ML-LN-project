He even asked him to teach him how he managed to snag such a beautiful goddess. If they\u2019re friends, he should teach him some tricks. As a single dog, he was almost going to die from jealousy.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong is a beauty. There is no doubt about it. Anyone who see\u2019s him couldn\u2019t help but be amazed by his pale skin, beautiful features, stunning figure and gentle personality.</p><br/><p>He Shuo likes his girlfriend a lot. Even after being together for two years, he would still feel helpless from time to time. He even felt that he was not worthy of her and that she is too good for him.</p><br/><p>His roommate asked him how he managed to get together with Wu Tong and he started to get lost in his thoughts.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t he who had pursed Wu Tong. It was Wu Tong who confessed to him first. After saying this, not only his roommate, even he couldn\u2019t understand it. There were obviously others who were more handsome, and better than him so why did Wu Tong choose him?</p><br/><p>He Shuo is about one metre ninety tall and has a muscular body. On top of that, he had a very manly appearance and a buzz cut. In anyone\u2019s eyes, he looks like a manly man that even gangsters would deliberatly move away from when he walks down the street. But, in reality, he isn\u2019t so strong. It was in fact the opposite. Perhaps it was because he grew up in a single-parent family, he had a delicate and sensitive heart and he is particularly concerned about people\u2019s impression of him.</p><br/><p>Since he was a child, he watched his mother raise him up while putting in all kinds of blood, sweat and tears. He felt particularly distressed for his mother and wished that would grow up soon and start earning money so that he could take care of his mother instead. It was also because he felt bad for his mother that he decided that if he had a girlfriend in the future, he would definitely treat her well and not make her sad.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what his future girlfriend would be like, but he didn\u2019t expect it to be someone as beautiful and great as Wu Tong. Wu Tong was beautiful to the point that he was a little overwhelmed. It was his first relationship and he was still immature, so he relied heavily on Wu Tong to guide him though. Despite being a man, his girlfriend would be the one deciding on where they should go for their date and how they should progress their relationship. Thinking about how useless he is, he hung his head in disappointment. He clearly wanted to protect his girlfriend and allow her to be carefree and happy.</p><br/><p>Once, he couldn\u2019t help but ask Wu Tong what he felt about being with him. Wu Tong didn\u2019t hesitate to smile radiantly and say: \u201cI\u2019m very happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Shuo was a little confused but after that it was as if Wu Tong noticed something and he had given He Shuo the authority to decide where they should go next and plan out their dates.</p><br/><p>Therefore, He Shuo felt deeply responsible. He carefully researched about dating sites, activities and food to create an intricate plan. He even asked for his friends\u2019 opinion. After seeing it, the friend immediately wacked his head, \u201cAre you dumb? With you writing so much, do you think your girlfriend is someone as tough and manly as you? Do you want to make her walk until her leg breaks?\u201d</p><br/><p>His friend angrily deleted and altered his date plan and did his best to make the itinerary more reasonable. The places that they were going were also not too far, at most it would be just a few stops away by subway.</p><br/><p>After it was done, He Shuo looked at his plans that had the majority deleted with a look of pity: \u201cThose are places that I wanted to go with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>His friend couldn\u2019t help but scold, \u201cYou can go next time. Do you think you\u2019re only going out on a date once?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Shuo scratched his head and a silly smile formed on his face. He looked up with enthusiasm. \u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d</p><br/><p>Friend: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Sure enough, love makes people stupid. But he also wants a chance to become stupid!</p><br/><p>Under his friends\u2019 guidance, the date that He Shuo had prepared for was completed successfully. Before they parted, He Shuo even asked nervously if Wu Tong was happy.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong turned to look at him with a gentle smile, \u201cHappy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, He shuo was even more happy. He smiled very happily and waved his hand before preparing to turn and leave. But at this moment, something flashed before He Shuo\u2019s eyes and he felt a soft and warm, cotton-like sensation on his lips. His mind went blank and he only realised that it was Wu Tong\u2019s lips after they separated. His face instantly flushed red and he stood dazed on the spot.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong seemingly found his reaction funny. The curve of his smile became bigger and he even licked his lips while saying: \u201cWith this, I\u2019m even happier today.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Shuo: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d He was shocked to the point that he was at loss for words. He finally returned to his senses when Wu Tong figure had already disappeared into the distance. Even his first kiss was something done because his girlfriend took the initiative!</p><br/><p>Thinking this, he wanted to bang his head on the wall and then beat himself up.</p><br/><p>Their emotional progression was very smooth and stable. Compared to other couples, it could be said that it is particularly good. They rarely had arguments and every day was simply dripping with honey.</p><br/><p>But this didn\u2019t mean that they have no troubles.</p><br/><p>He Shuo\u2019s biggest concern was that his girlfriend is just too good. When he said this, it made others feel hatred for him for showing off his love but He Shuo really meant it. Sometimes, he could sense that Wu Tong was hiding something from him and just doing his best to act like the image he had established of himself.</p><br/><p>He understood that people will change in front of the person that they like and that they would deliberately show their best sides. It was a good attitude but, after getting along over time, he didn\u2019t want his girlfriend to act all the time. He felt that they should reveal some bad habits and he could just tolerate it. Afterall, he felt that his girlfriend is tolerating a lot more things about him. It wasn\u2019t fair like this.</p><br/><p>Although he thought this inside, he never said it to Wu Tong.</p><br/><p>Perhaps somewhere deep inside, the more he worried, the timider he had become.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but be worried. If Wu Tong isn\u2019t willing to tell him, is it because it was something that he couldn\u2019t accept? Thinking this, he didn\u2019t dare to ask and even tried to escape from it.</p><br/><p>Later, He Shuo went to find Wu Tong without telling him in advance. He inadvertently ran into him chatting with his friend. Looking at that scene, he was definitely acting very differently compared to when he was with He Shuo.</p><br/><p>Relaxed and lazy,</p><br/><p>Wu Tong rested his elbow on the railing and leaned back with a cigarette held between his fingers. He took a drag and slowly spat it out. The smoke lingered around, blurring his face. He wasn\u2019t gentle like how he was when he was around He Shuo. He had a rather cold expression. With one look, you could tell that this was his true unmasked self.</p><br/><p>Xu Jun stood next to him also smoking a cigarette. His actions were a little rougher than Wu Tong\u2019s. He tapped off some ash into an empty box next to him and then asked nonchalantly: \u201cYou\u2019ve been together for so long and you still opened it up to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tong raised his eyes and just continued to concentrate on smoking. He ignored him and didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>Xu Jun didn\u2019t care about him trying to hide from the truth. He reminded as a friend, \u201cYou can\u2019t always hide it from him. It\u2019s unfair for He Shuo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know.\u201d Wu Tong answered impatiently. He appeared quite reluctant to talk about this matter.</p><br/><p>He Shuo was a little surprised. His mind was a mess. Xu Jun just mentioned me? What did he mean that it\u2019s unfair to hide it from me? Don\u2019t tell me Wu Tong is cheating and hasn\u2019t thought of a way to break up with him?</p><br/><p>Before he had the chance to think about it anymore, he had already subconsciously stepped out and walked into Wu Tong\u2019s line of sight.</p><br/><p>When Wu Tong heard his movement, he looked over and a hint of panic, confusion and surprise flashed through his eyes. He didn\u2019t expect him to be here. He quickly hid the cigarette behind him.</p><br/><p>Xu Jun was also surprised but seeing that spineless reaction of Wu Tong\u2019s he shrugged his shoulder and said with interest: \u201cI\u2019ll leave first.\u201d He then turned around and left.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong was frustrated to death. He madly tried to figure out when He Shuo had arrived and what he had overheard. They didn\u2019t say what he was hiding from him earlier did they?</p><br/><p>He Shuo saw his face constantly changing. The usually soft and gently expression had become filled with panic. He Shuo pursed his lips and only spoke up after a long time: \u201cYou\u2019re hiding something from me.\u201d</p><br/><p>His straightforwardness stunned Wu Tong. But it was also a fact that could not be denied so he could only nod his head in affirmation.</p><br/><p>He Shuo: \u201cCan you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tong paused and shook his head.</p><br/><p>He Shuo laughed at himself and then turned to leave.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong chased after him, \u201cAre you angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Shuo\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change. He slowly pried off Wu Tong\u2019s hand that was holding onto his and said faintly: \u201cWe should both calm down a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time, he really left. The moment he turned away, he saw Wu Tong\u2019s sad expression. He found it a little funny. Clearly he\u2019s the one hiding things from him so what is he upset about?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that they should calm down, He Shuo didn\u2019t meet with Wu Tong again. When others asked, he would say that they\u2019re busy and didn\u2019t have time to date.</p><br/><p>But in the end, they didn\u2019t break up. It was just a cold war. At least, it was a unilateral cold war on He Shuo\u2019s end. On WeChat, messages from Wu Tong quickly built up. All the messages were filled with placating words and the tone was filled with a hint of humbleness. He Shuo didn\u2019t reply but he read each of them seriously. The more Wu Tong tried to placate him, the more his heart sank. What on earth is he hiding from him? Acting like this, if it is because she has another man, she should just clearly cut him off. What kind of man would happily accept being cheated on?!</p><br/><p>Others didn\u2019t know their situation and only know that their relationship is good and very lovey-dovey. But when this happened, they already had an outing organised. The organiser saw that they\u2019re a couple, so he arranged them a room together. Because he didn\u2019t have the time to pay attention to anything else, He Shuo only found out about this on the day and it was too late to change. They came in order to participate in the light festival. There were people everywhere and hotels have long been booked out.</p><br/><p>When the organiser saw that his expression didn\u2019t look right and asked nervously, afraid that it would trouble the other person, He Shuo said that it was nothing. He thought, it\u2019s a twin room anyway and it wasn\u2019t just one bed. He could just bear with it and get through one night of awkwardness.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, it was just as he had thought. In the evening, there were crowds everywhere and the light festival was extraordinarily lively. When Wu Tong stood next to him, he still subconsciously wanted to protect her from getting hit by the crowd. He Shuo was a little surprised by those natural actions of his but he continued to maintain a calm expression while he protected her. There\u2019s no need to let Wu Tong get hurt just because of a small conflict between them.</p><br/><p>He clearly didn\u2019t know what kind of unspeakable secret his girlfriend is hiding from him, but he still stubbornly protected her. He Shuo felt that he really is stupid.</p><br/><p>When they returned to the hotel, Wu Tong opened his mouth several times wanting to talk to him but after they left the group, He Shuo naturally increased the distance between them and didn\u2019t give her any attention. After several failed attempts, he seemingly accepted defeat and remained quiet.</p><br/><p>For an entire night, they didn\u2019t speak a word.</p><br/><p>The next morning, when He Shuo opened his eyes, his mind was still not completely awake. He looked blankly around the room as he slowly remembered where he was. Suddenly, a large patch of snow-white skin, a beautiful arc of the back and a slender waist came into view\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Wu Tong was changing clothes!</p><br/><p>When He Shuo realised this, his heart leapt. In an instant, he wanted to look away but the second before he could do that, Wu Tong had slowly turned around and he saw a flat front.</p><br/><p>He Shuo had forgotten to look away and was shocked by the unbelievable scene.</p><br/><p>Short hair, flat chest, smooth and prominent muscles and below his waist\u2026..</p><br/><p>This was a man who looked exactly like Wu Tong.</p><br/><p>He Shuo laid in bed and was caught off-guard when their gazes met.</p><br/><p>Without even needing to think, he knew that it would be impossible for a man and woman to look exactly the same with not a hint of difference. Even if they were twins, they would look different. There was only one explanation for this man standing before him.</p><br/><p>The air went stagnant for a few seconds.</p><br/><p>He Shuo: \u201cYou\u2019re a man?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man nodded.</p><br/><p>He Shuo: \u201cThis was what you were hiding from me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man again nodded.</p><br/><p>He Shuo released the tight grip of his blankets and got out of bed with a cold expression. He washed up, changed and then left the room. Throughout the whole process, he didn\u2019t give a single glance in Wu Tong\u2019s direction. Wu Tong also didn\u2019t chase after him or ask him to stay.</p><br/><p>After a long period of time, the two didn\u2019t meet. He Shuo\u2019s dense roommate also noticed that something was wrong. He asked: \u201cWhat happened between you and your girlfriend? A fight?\u201d</p><br/><p>The roommate wanted to ease his mood and joked: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me the other person discovered your bad skills and you ended up hurting her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Another person smacked him: \u201cHow can that be? Our He Shuo is a good child. How can he do that to his girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guy\u2019s should stop talking about those things. It\u2019s his business so he will deal with it himself. But He Shuo, seeing you acting like this, it\u2019s obvious you still have feelings for her. Why don\u2019t you talk to her to clear things up? You\u2019ll be the one regretting it in the future. I\u2019m giving you this advice as a brother. You can see as you fit.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, He Shuo really didn\u2019t know what to do.</p><br/><p>In the past he really loved her, but now he is troubled.</p><br/><p>To be honest, when he found out that Wu Tong\u2019s secret wasn\u2019t the fact that she had another guy, a part of him was elated. Even he was surprised by this reaction of his and he later scolded himself for being stupid. Your girlfriend just turned into a boyfriend. This is a huge problem okay?! What are you feeling elated for?!</p><br/><p>After they left the hotel, He Shuo only received three messages from Wu Tong. Compared to the previous messages from before, these messages were more concise, upset and desperate.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Shuo, are you angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to break up with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t break up okay? Please.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if it wasn\u2019t a voice message, He Shuo could tell how desperate he was through those words.</p><br/><p>As for the thing about Wu Tong being a man, in fact, He Shuo didn\u2019t really care about that. What he was more concerned about was why Wu Tong would deceive him. He hated being lied to. But really, if Wu Tong and he were both men, if you asked him whether he would be willing to continue being together, he wouldn\u2019t be able to answer immediately. His decision would depend on what he cared more about. Wu Tong was special to him. He had already surpassed everything and all he cared about was the person called Wu Tong. But he was deceived from the very beginning and he was shocked by this discovery, so he didn\u2019t know how to face Wu Tong. Like this, he kept dragging things out and he never sent back a reply.</p><br/><p>This kind of negative emotion enveloped him and, seeing this, his roommates complained about him acting like life no longer had any meaning. They even started discussing about the difference between a man and a woman after breaking up. With He Shuo acting like an empty shell, Wu Tong\u2019s side would probably start off with a storm of crying, but she would soon recover from the sadness and continue on with life. They said this trying to convince He Shuo to cheer up.</p><br/><p>But He Shuo maintained this state until one day he received a call. Through the phone, he heard Xu Jun\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, he\u2019s drunk. Keeps calling your name. So annoying. I\u2019m leaving him here so you should hurry and come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>After leaving the address, he didn\u2019t give the other party a chance to refuse and immediately hung up.</p><br/><p>After hesitating for a while, He Shuo still went.</p><br/><p>When he arrived, he saw Wu Tong wearing men\u2019s attiure and looking stunning, but he laid sprawled pathetically across the table. His consciousness wasn\u2019t clear, and his face was flushed red from the alcohol. He looked like a poor and innocent puppy that was abandoned by its master.</p><br/><p>He Shuo picked the man up and carried him out. Because he didn\u2019t know where Wu Tong\u2019s place was and he couldn\u2019t find Xu Jun, he could only bring him over to a nearby hotel. Xu Jun who sat in the corner quietly observing them saw him take the other person away and scoffed. After a few more drinks, he felt bored drinking by himself and also left.</p><br/><p>What was fortunate was that despite being drunk, Wu Tong could still be considered rather well-behaved. He didn\u2019t act crazy and only mumbled incoherently. He Shuo leaned in to try and decipher his words and realised that he was constantly repeating and apologising.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Shuo, I\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He Shuo pursed his lips. He opened the room to the hotel room, dragged the other person inside and threw him onto the bed with much difficulty. Although Wu Tong was a little shorter than him but, as someone who is one metre eighty, he was not light. In addition, he was drunk and didn\u2019t know to cooperate, so it made the task very difficult.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong clung onto him like a koala, unwilling to let go. He continued to protest vaguely when the other person tried to pry him off. The warm alcohol filled breath could be felt on his neck and this made He Shuo stiffen up. His neck felt itchy and the places where Wu Tong touched felt hot. His heart pounded helplessly fast.</p><br/><p>After a moment of distraction, He Shuo didn\u2019t know what happened but the next second, he found himself being pressed down onto the soft bed. On top of him was a warm body that was covered in the smell of alcohol.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong\u2019s face was very close to his. It was also at this moment that He Shuo realised that the other person had already sobered up significantly and had taken this opportunity push him down.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to kiss you.\u201d Wu Tong\u2019s voice was low and hoarse. Within those words were strong desire and emotions. He took the risk and very straightforwardly expressed his thoughts. The next second, his tone softened down and became humbler. Without a lack of confidence, \u201cI beg you. Okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>He Shuo looked at him and didn\u2019t speak. And then, he didn\u2019t know what came over him \u2013 perhaps it was because of the sadness in his eyes making him feel bad, he lifted his head up and kissed Wu Tong\u2019s lips.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong stiffened up at this before responding vigorously by sucking his lips. It was so fierce that it was as if he wanted to absorb He Shuo into him.</p><br/><p>An unknown amount of time passed, and their lips finally parted. Wu Tong lightly pressed onto his lips and asked carefully: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Have you forgiven me?\u201d</p><br/><p>There seemed to be a hint of trembling in his voice that made He Shuo feel uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>He Shuo looked at him seriously and said, \u201cYes, I like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because I like you, I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re a man or a woman.</p><br/><p>He Shuo had decided. Before, he didn\u2019t think over things properly. Even if he is not a girlfriend, he likes him so they can still be together. He could still pamper him the same and he didn\u2019t need to think too much about it.</p><br/><p>He wants to spoil Wu Tong. Later he would realise that he would end up being spoiled more instead.</p><br/><p>The two insecure boys cuddled closely together and unexpectedly found it quite fitting.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

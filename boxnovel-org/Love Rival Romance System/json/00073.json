He grabbed the child and examined his face carefully. He saw that his eyes indeed resembled Jiang Yang\u2019s, it was just that his face was still child-like, and his features had not completely developed, \u201cYou\u2019re called Jiang Yang, then is your father called Jiang Jian Hua and your mum Liang Ying?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little boy\u2019s eyes widened, and he was even more shocked: \u201cHow did you know?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Sure enough, this is Jiang Yang as a child.</p><br/><p>After Qin Xu was surprised, his mood improved. He finally met someone he was familiar with and his heart calmed down. It was then filled with curiosity. This is Jiang Yang. He was already so cute at a young age, all soft and tender. He couldn\u2019t help but want to pinch those chubby cheeks of his a few times.</p><br/><p>As he thought this, he immediately put it into action. He not only pinched that soft face of his, he even ruffled his hair with a satisfied and happy smile.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Yang was completely stunned. His face blushed red and a humiliated expression slowly formed on his face. For a boy, it was extremely humiliating having his face pinched and head rubbed! So angry!</p><br/><p>The other child who ran over to find little Jiang Yang watched the tall and strong Qin Xu smile like that while messing with his friend was suddenly scared to tears. \u201cWuwuwu, someone\u2019s bullying Jiang Yang. What to do\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The other child was also panicking, \u201cLet\u2019s get our mummy and daddy. No, we should find the police uncle\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, they were just six or seven-year-old children. With one look, they knew that the other person was someone that they couldn\u2019t deal with. The disparity between them was almost like a novice player going up against a full levelled final boss! They were both nervous and scared and couldn\u2019t calm down at all.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu didn\u2019t think that just touching little Jiang Yang\u2019s face would terrify the little children to that extend. He felt like he had done something wrong and he proceeded to fumble around and coax them: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, I\u2019m not a bad person\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The teary-eyed children started crying even more fiercely, \u201cThis is what bad guys always said on TV! Bad people won\u2019t ever admit that they are bad uwaaaaa!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>If it was just that, then it wasn\u2019t anything major but even little Jiang Yang looked at him with vigilance. In a hurry, he suddenly remembered a trick that he could use to placate them. From his pocket he pulled out a coin and showed it to the children: \u201cLook, what\u2019s this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The children glanced over at him while busy crying and pouted. Isn\u2019t it just a coin?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled and then clenched his fist. With his other hand, he waved around over it like he was casting some magic. He muttered a few words and then opened his hands again, \u201cLook.\u201d</p><br/><p>The palm of his hand was empty.</p><br/><p>The children suddenly widen their eyes in surprise and momentarily forgot to cry. Their small faces were filled with shock, where did the coin go?</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Yang was also extremely curious. In disbelief, he reached his small hands and searched his hands and pockets to see if it was hidden in there.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu grabbed onto his small, warm hands and said: \u201cIt tickles. Wait, I\u2019ll pull it up for you.</p><br/><p>Then, under little Jiang Yang\u2019s fervent gaze, he rolled up his sleeves to reveal his slender and muscular forearm. The coin however was nowhere to be seen.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was confused. In a childish voice he asked: \u201cWhere did you hide the coin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled: \u201cI don\u2019t know, it disappeared. Let me find it\u2026..Ah, wait.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he bent down with bright eyes and stared at little Jiang Yang. This made little Jiang Yang a little surprised and nervous. He unconsciously clenched his little fist, \u201cWh-what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s fingers brushed past his hair like he was looking for something. He said: \u201cI found it, it\u2019s here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Yang watched him take out the coin from his hair and suddenly became very excited. His pair of bright eyes stared at Qin Xu and his expression was filled with amazement. Those burning hot eyes of his made Qin Xu feel a little embarrassed. This was nothing but a little trick used to tease little children with.</p><br/><p>But the children were completely fooled by him. They looked at him as if he was someone amazing and was filled with worship. The vigilance that they had earlier was instantly gone and they started saying sweetly, \u201cBrother, please teach us.\u201d</p><br/><p>But something like magic was something that would no longer be fun if you revealed its secrets. He had also finally managed to find something that he could use to coax the children with so if he reveals this last hand of his, what else could he use?</p><br/><p>And so, Qin Xu pretended to be conflicted, \u201cBut this\u2026..isn\u2019t something that I can teach anybody.\u201d</p><br/><p>The children\u2019s\u2019 bright eyes didn\u2019t have a trace of frustration. Instead, they felt that this was something extremely precious and their desire to learn was even stronger, \u201cThen what should we do for you to teach us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu mulled over this and he deliberately squinted his eyes with a look of complication. He whispered in a mysterious voice: \u201cThis kind of thing is very important. I can only pass it onto people who are close to me. Others can\u2019t know about it\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>This attitude of his made the other children follow suit and also lower their voices. This made them look even more adorable. \u201cI promise I won\u2019t tell other people so can you teach me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu dragged out a sound and looked conflicted, \u201cBut I\u2019m not close to you. Not familiar with you at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The children were stunned. He said that they would need to be close to him so that he could teach them but what should they do to become close to him? The little radish heads huddled together and started discussing but what they said still reached Qin Xu\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>\u201cTo be close means that the relationship is good, like mummy and daddy? But I have mummy and daddy, that brother can\u2019t take their place.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut I really want to learn. Can we just let him for one day and then ask for mummy and daddy back the next day?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t want your parents? I\u2019ll tell aunty and uncle!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cN-no. It\u2019s just for one day. They\u2019re still my mummy and daddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>After discussing for a long time, the little radish heads still couldn\u2019t reach a proper conclusion. Their little faces were filled with conflict as they said to Qin Xu: \u201cWe can\u2019t bear losing mummy and daddy. Is there another way?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was about to be rendered to tears by little Jiang Yang\u2019s cuteness. He found it really fun teasing these children, \u201cApart from your mummy and daddy, there is another person who will be close to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho? Grandma and grandpa?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s not wrong but I was referring to someone other than them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho else is there?\u201d The children were confuddled.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour future wives.\u201d Qin Xu laughed.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026.Wife?\u201d The children were a little confused. They wrinkled their brows in thought, \u201cSo, if you\u2019re my wife then you\u2019ll teach me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu laughed: \u201cIn theory, yes. But I\u2019m a man so I will be marrying a wife in the future and I will only teach that person.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little radish heads were very disappointed, and they pouted their lips in dissatisfaction. One even complained quietly: \u201cSigh, why am I a boy.\u201d He had only said that he wanted to change gender because he really wanted to learn the magic trick and didn\u2019t really mean it. He would soon forget that he had even said it the next day.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu said: \u201cAlthough I can\u2019t teach you, I can still perform a few for you. If you manage to find the trick to it, then I won\u2019t even need to teach you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After this, the little radish heads were once again very spirited. This was particularly the case for little Jiang Yang. He looked at Qin Xu with a burning gaze that was about to bore right through him.</p><br/><p>But, no matter how big or round his eyes were, he could only exclaim in surprise and admiration. He couldn\u2019t figure out the secret the magic trick, but he didn\u2019t regret it at all. He just thought that this big brother is too amazing. He would also from time to time be his little assistant and this only made him very happy. When he touched Qin Xu\u2019s forearm with his little hands, he found that it was surprisingly hard.</p><br/><p>The other two children heard his cry of surprise and also moved to poke at Qin Xu\u2019s arms with curiosity. They then touched their own forearms. It was very different. They asked: \u201cBig brother, why is your hand so hard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201cThis is muscle. It proves that the body is strong. In the future you will exercise more, and you\u2019ll also have it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The children, including Jiang Yang, were envious.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s eyes met with Jiang Yang\u2019s gaze and he couldn\u2019t help but be in a good mood. On a whim he reached out and held him under his armpits before lifting him up into the air and throwing him up and down. The weightless feeling initially made little Jiang Yang surprised but, after experiencing it for a while, he found it fun and started laughing cheerfully. While laughing he revealed his small teeth and even a lovely dimple at the corner of his mouth.</p><br/><p>Really is too cute.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu played with him like this and didn\u2019t feel tired at all. His heart was filled with indescribable emotions as he watched little Jiang Yang laugh.</p><br/><p>Little Jiang Yang played very happily and had forgotten about his other little friends. The other friends however were envious, so they also grabbed onto Qin Xu\u2019s leg crying out that they also wanted a turn.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the children started competing. Little Jiang Yang was playing very happily and naturally didn\u2019t want to stop. The moment he saw Qin Xu moving to put him down, he immediately hooked his two chubby hands around his neck and his pair of short legs moved to wrap around Qin Xu. His legs were unfortunately too short, so he could just hang from Qin Xu\u2019s neck like a koala.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu didn\u2019t expect him to be like this. After a moment of being stunned, he laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>The other two children grabbed onto Qin Xu\u2019s pants and looked up to complain that little Jiang Yang is acting embarrassing and that it\u2019s now their turn. Little Jiang Yang refused and said that he wanted to play a little longer.</p><br/><p>Generally speaking, the children should be treated fairly, and everyone should take turns and play for the same amount of time but who is Qin Xu? He is obviously biased towards Jiang Yang. And so, he did as Jiang Yang said and played with him for a while. He then picked up the other children and lifted them up a few times half-heartedly before finally letting them down.</p><br/><p>Everyone had a great time, but they remembered that they still had to go home so they could only reluctantly wave goodbye. As for whether they could find the big brother again to play? Qin Xu understood the situation very well and he thought that it wasn\u2019t good to lie to a child, so he didn\u2019t directly agree and only said that he didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>When the little radish heads reluctantly parted, Qin Xu wandered around the street bored. He thought that he is very strange; after transmigrating he didn\u2019t panic at all. At this moment, a sound suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need to panic. This is something us systems have arranged. You will be going back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu heard the system\u2019s mechanical sound and felt a little nostalgic. After all, he hadn\u2019t heard from it for a long time, \u201cThis is a task? Is there a time limit?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot a task. You can just do as you want. When things are over, you will go back. It won\u2019t take much time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing that it was about to end, Qin Xu was even more calm, \u201cThen do I need to find a place to stay tonight? I don\u2019t have much cash, so I might need to sleep on the streets.\u201d</p><br/><p>System: \u201cNo need. It\u2019ll only be one to two hours.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was curious: \u201cWhat is it? Does it have something to do with Jiang Yang?\u201d</p><br/><p>System: \u201cI can\u2019t tell you directly, but I can give you a hint. This has something to do with why Jiang Yang is afraid of the dark.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu heard this and couldn\u2019t help but frown. This is ten years ago, and Jiang Yang is still young. If it is something to do with his fear of the dark, then something bad must\u2019ve happened.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, He immediately turned and ran back to the park he was at earlier. His first thought was to find Jiang Yang and protect him from any harm. At the same time, he tried to elicit more information out of the system, but it only said that it had happened in the past and he would not be able to change what had already happened.</p><br/><p>The system is an artificial intelligence. It has no feelings, so it could remain rational and calm. It said, isn\u2019t the future Jiang Yang fine? You don\u2019t need to worry.</p><br/><p>But how would Qin Xu remain calm when he knows that Jiang Yang is going to meet a bad predicament? Even if he knew that he may be in danger, he still wanted to do his best to minimise the danger. That\u2019s the person that he likes, how could he be willing to let him get hurt!</p><br/><p>The system fell silent. After becoming silent for a moment, it proceeded to point out Jiang Yang\u2019s location.</p><br/><p>On the other side, after little Jiang Yang parted from his friends, he didn\u2019t immediately go home. Using the remaining change in his pockets, he ran off to buy snacks from a nearby store. Because the owner of the store closest to home was familiar with his parents, he would quickly be exposed if he went there so he deliberately walked further on to another store.</p><br/><p>Even so, he didn\u2019t go to far from home. Little Jiang Yang was only in grade 1 and had never thought that he would be in any danger. He happily thought about what he could spend his pocket money on when he suddenly felt someone pull him over. A stranger suddenly grabbed his hands and, using the opportunity when he is too shocked to react, he picked him up and walked in another direction.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang panicked. He didn\u2019t know what to do and could only struggle while shouting: \u201cWho are you? Let me go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The man however pretended to be familiar with him and said: \u201cDon\u2019t make trouble. There are already enough toys at home.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

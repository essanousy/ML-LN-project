He immediately strode over and shouted: \u201cWhat are you guys doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The boys naturally dispersed and moved back to their respective places. The teacher didn\u2019t manage to work out what was happening and could only give them a warning before walking away.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang walked back to the metal seats with a cold expression. When he sat down, Qin Xu who had his head buried in his arms looked up and revealed his red eyes, and weak and pitiful appearance. Jiang Yang saw this and felt even more dissatisfied. In an annoyed tone he asked: \u201cDoes it hurt that much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu with his red-rimmed eyes nodded. Although he was no longer crying, he still looked very pitiful. It made the anger inside Jiang Yang disperse. He wanted to knock him on the head but recalling the fact that he was just hit in the head, he restrained himself and just pinched his cheeks while scolding him: \u201cIf anyone is bullying you are you just going to cry? You have to fight back so that the others know that you are not easy to bully, understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu had his cheeks pinched and his words were slightly muffled as he did his best to try and explain himself: \u201cIt hurt too much. I couldn\u2019t help it. You said I shouldn\u2019t let others see me cry so I wanted to dry my tears first and then fight him, but you helped me fight him before I could.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he reached the end of that sentence, he couldn\u2019t help but curve his eyes and smile very happily. He even leaned forward and hugged Jiang Yang.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had completely frozen from the shock. It took him a while before he could return to his senses and roughly push Qin Xu away. For some reason, there was a strange feeling inside him that he couldn\u2019t describe. He stood up and suddenly walked away from the court. Without a thought, Qin Xu also followed behind him. His voice was still a little hoarse from crying earlier as he asked: \u201cWhere are you going? I\u2019m coming too.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, class had not yet ended, and the teacher must blow the whistle to signal the end of class, but this isn\u2019t the first time for Jiang Yang to do this.</p><br/><p>The direction they went in allowed them to pass by the small school store. The aroma of sausages and fish balls floated over and lured Qin Xu\u2019s stomach. He couldn\u2019t help but look over in that direction.</p><br/><p>He reached out to hold onto Jiang Yang, but Jiang Yang unexpectedly had a very big reaction and immediately threw Qin Xu off. Qin Xu was surprised, and felt a little wronged.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked back and realised that he wanted to get some snacks. He breathed a sigh of relief and said: \u201cIf you want it, go and get it yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu however didn\u2019t show any intent to move. He looked at him and stubbornly said: \u201cCome with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang rolled his eyes: \u201cIsn\u2019t it just buying something?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu pouted and said bitterly: \u201cMy head hurts, I feel a little dizzy\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang heard this and glanced at the place that was hit by the basketball. It had swollen up into a small lump and for it to heal it would take at least ten days. Thinking this, Jiang Yang\u2019s impatience faded. He pursed his lips and headed over to the school store without a word.</p><br/><p>When they came out, Qin Xu was holding onto a sausage. Jiang Yang walked ahead expressionlessly with his hands in his pockets. Before he could take more than two steps, his arm was pulled back and for a moment the warmth from that hand attacked him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang frowned and looked over as Qin Xu smiled innocently at him and brought the fragrant sausage in front of him offering him to take a bite.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d He really feels like he is taking a child around. Very exhausting.</p><br/><p>He thought this was bad but as it turns out, the worst was yet to come.</p><br/><p>As they walked on, they ran into Wu Tong and his junior brother. The moment their gazes met, Wu Tong\u2019s line of sight fell meaningfully at their intertwined hands. Jiang Yang subconsciously wanted to let go but Qin Xu held onto him firmly. As soon as he realised that he had the intention to throw his hands off, he even increased the strength of his hold.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt at loss for words and couldn\u2019t explain himself out of this situation. Forget it, he might as well just act natural.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong walked over, and a soft smile appeared on his lips. If it was before, Jiang Yang probably would have thought that the smile of the female goddess is gorgeous but after seeing Wu Tong\u2019s other side, he is no longer that na\u00efve. He only curved up his lips in response.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou guys finally\u2026\u201d Wu Tong\u2019s voice was very soft, but it was spoken with some tacit meaning.</p><br/><p>The corners of Jiang Yang\u2019s lips twitched. He wanted to ask, what are you on about?</p><br/><p>They two looked at each other like this for a while. Qin Xu saw this and felt unhappy. He immediately expressed this through his actions. He pulled Jiang Yang behind him and stood between them to block their line of sight. He glared over at Wu Tong coldly and used his eyes to warn him not to get too close with Jiang Yang.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was not prepared to be pulled back and was temporarily stunned. Before he could react and ask him what he\u2019s doing, he heard Qin Xu yell out a phrase, like a beast whose territory had just been violated, \u201cHe\u2019s mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>The next second, Qin Xu even looked back at him and whisper: \u201cFather, I don\u2019t like her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Inexplicably, the moment Qin Xu said those words, he imagined himself in a scenario involving a son not approving his divorced fathers\u2019 new wife\u2026\u2026What the hell?!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang sighed. He looked up and once again met Wu Tong\u2019s ambiguous gaze before quickly nodding his head in greeting and dragging Qin Xu off. What he didn\u2019t realise was that this move of his made Wu Tong misunderstand that he had acknowledged their relationship. Of course, Jiang Yang didn\u2019t know what relationship Wu Tong thought he had with Qin Xu!</p><br/><p>Qin (spoiled child) Xu was dragged upstairs by Jiang (father) Yang. Seeing that Jiang Yang didn\u2019t pay much attention to the girl and just left, his mood had improved significantly. He finished off his sausage and then used his teeth to tear open a chip packet. He tipped it back and started to eat the chips with loud crunching noises.</p><br/><p>When the afternoon classes had ended, Jiang Yang and the others had dinner and then returned to the dormitory to take a shower. Qin Xu continued to stick to him throughout and again whinged that he didn\u2019t want to take a shower unless Jiang Yang played a few rounds of the game with him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at the time and saw that it was almost six. Not wanting to miss Qin Xu\u2019s expression when he recovers, he just smiled like a kind, wise father and said: \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled with much satisfaction and very excitedly teamed up with him.</p><br/><p>After finishing the first round, an electronic sound suddenly appeared in his mind: \u201cThe punishment is over.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked up at Qin Xu and saw that he had suddenly stiffened up and his expression was very awkward. Even the character that he was controlling in the game had stopped moving. He threw down his phone and quickly said: \u201cI\u2019ll go shower!\u201d</p><br/><p>He then randomly grabbed his clothes and rushed into the bathroom as if he was escaping from a ghost.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang froze for a moment before the corners of his lips lifted up and a big smile formed on his face. Huang Shao saw this and couldn\u2019t help but feel the hairs on his back stand. He asked: \u201cJiang Yang, what are you thinking about that\u2019s making you smile so grotesquely?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang did not answer. He just threw Qin Xu\u2019s phone over to get him to help Qin Xu play. On the screen were countless curses from his teammates for suddenly going offline Going offline during the middle of a game is something that is very damaging to teammates and could result into all kinds of anger and hatred. Qin Xu naturally is not someone who would do this, but he was so scared out of his wits today that he immediately turned around and ran. It looks like this shameful incident will be deeply engraved into his memories for life.</p><br/><p>Thinking this, Jiang Yang felt very satisfied. It looks like its time to settle the accounts.</p><br/><p>And so, when Qin Xu was done with showering, he walked out of the bathroom hesitantly. While drying his wet hair, he scanned around the room and hoped to see Jiang Yang absent but the moment he saw that the room was empty, in addition to breathing a sigh of relief, he somehow felt a little disappointed. It probably is the same feeling a child feels when his father gets annoyed and leaves him behind.</p><br/><p>Just as he bowed his head in slight disappointment, a taunting voice rang out.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu turned his head around sharply. Sure enough, Jiang Yang stood there leaning against the wall. With his arms crossed in front of him, a mocking smile formed on his face. He said bluntly: \u201cI still haven\u2019t settled the accounts with you so how can I be willing to go ahead without you my son~\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s expression was filled with black lines. He suddenly didn\u2019t want to see him anymore. He roughly dried his hair and then tried to shirk his responsibility: \u201cSettle what account? If not for that damned system, why would I be like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was still clear minded. He logically retorted: \u201cThe system only made you lose your memory, it didn\u2019t take away your intelligence. That must be your hidden nature, right? Crying day in and day out, I was almost turned crazy by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those memories were still fresh in his mind and even if he wanted to forget it, he couldn\u2019t erase it from his memory. He felt very embarrassed and he himself also wanted to know why he would become like that after losing his memory. It was as if his psychological age had regressed!</p><br/><p>After making fun of Qin Xu, Jiang Yang finally revealed his true intentions. He waved his phone around and smiled: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to admit it? I have evidence here. Who would\u2019ve known that Qin school idol actually has a side like this to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside that phone of his naturally were the photos Jiang Yang had taken of his adorable son this morning.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu also couldn\u2019t accept this black history of his. He instantly reached out to grab it while complaining that Jiang Yang has no conscience: \u201cYou have the nerve to say that? Facing someone so simple and innocent like that, you actually shamelessly did something like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang agilely dodged and raised his eyebrows, \u201cHey, you really dare to say that? Don\u2019t you feel embarrassed complimenting yourself like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201cI\u2019m just speaking the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang pursed his lips and hid his phone behind his back. Qin Xu wanted to steal it, so he naturally followed it and ended up looping his arms around him like he is holding him in his embrace. He had just taken a shower and, without wearing a shirt, he directly attached himself to Jiang Yang.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt very uncomfortable in this sudden intimate position and immediately frowned with disgust. He quickly reached out to pull his arms off. Unfortunately, Qin Xu was no herbivore. With his fast reflexes, he noticed his momentarily distracted state and soon managed to press his hand that was still holding onto the phone against the wall. He looked down at Jiang Yang with a smirk and, somehow, they ended up in a kabe-don position.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang originally wanted to continue provoking him, but he found himself pressed up against the wall and trapped between the wall and his exposed chest. Seeing that firm, wheat-coloured skin at such a such a close distance, he felt his eyes sting and couldn\u2019t help but feel unhappy. His hand that\u2019s pressed onto the wall could not move and his other hand was busy holding down Qin Xu\u2019s other hand and pushing it away. With both his hands busy, he naturally would be using his legs.</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, he threw a kick. The moment the kick landed, he could hear a soft groan from above him and he quickly followed this with a punch in his abdomen. As he did this, he also agilely twisted his body and escaped from his hold. He shoved his phone back into his pocket and smiled at Qin Xu: \u201cDon\u2019t mess with me or I\u2019ll send those photos to the whole class.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu rubbed his sore abdomen with a frown, but he still managed to laugh: \u201cThat small body of yours is very flexible. Have you trained it before?\u201d</p><br/><p>For once, Jiang Yang didn\u2019t get angry. He just responded with a smile: \u201cThat\u2019s right. I practiced the arts of how to disable Qin Xu and the art of how to kill Qin Xu with just my foot.\u201d</p><br/><p>The smile disappeared from Qin Xu\u2019s face, \u201cYou even trained specially to deal with me. I am really flattered.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s right my son, I will always pamper you~\u201d Jiang Yang laughed as he waved his hand and walked out of the dormitory room.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

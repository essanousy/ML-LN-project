In addition to his anger towards Xiao Yuxin, there was also something else that annoyed him. What irritated him was that damned system. It would release tasks from time to time that he had no choice but to complete. It was as if it was one of those special family superiors that he could only obey without a word. Things like you should get along with this person or treat that person well or learn more from him; hearing this he couldn\u2019t help but feel disgusted.</p><br/><p>Something similar to this had also happened in the past. On the surface Jiang Yang obediently nodded and said that he understood but, in fact, he secretly did not do any of those things that were requested. But right now, this \u201cparent\u201d of his is not human and he couldn\u2019t get rid of it.</p><br/><p>Annoyed, Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but scribble randomly in his book.</p><br/><p>At night when they\u2019re sleeping in the dormitory, because he was had been awakened by the system for several nights, Jiang Yang had actually formed a biological clock inside. Around the time when the system would normally wake him up he automatically woke up and rolled over. Looking over at the bottom bunk of the bed next to him he saw that Qin Xu that guy had once again kicked off his blankets in his sleep and even had one of his legs pressing onto that pile of blankets.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang yawned. Since the system didn\u2019t assign him a task this time he obviously didn\u2019t want to deal with him. He pulled back his blankets, turned around to face the wall and continued to sleep very comfortably.</p><br/><p>Waking up the next day, Jiang Yang had slept very well. He washed up with great enthusiasm and when he headed out he inadvertently saw that Qin Xu was still sleeping while holding onto his blanket. Inside he silently spat: Are you a pig? You really can sleep.</p><br/><p>In fact, shortly after he left Qin Xu woke up. His face was particularly unsightly. He didn\u2019t sleep well last night and was awakened by the cold several times throughout the night. His head still felt a little heavy and he looked up at the upper bunk of the bed next to his with dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>After helping cover him up for the past few nights, why didn\u2019t he help last night?! Caused him to almost freeze to death! If he actually ends up catching a cold then it\u2019s definitely that guys\u2019 \u2013 Jiang Yang\u2019s fault!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu had not completely awakened and didn\u2019t realise how unreasonable those thoughts of his were. He was acting like a child who had been pampered until now suddenly finding out that the other party didn\u2019t love him enough and was throwing a tantrum.</p><br/><p>With a dark face, Qin Xu washed up quickly. He wore his shoes and headed to the classroom wanting to catch up on his sleep. But he didn\u2019t expect that on the rare occasion where he went to class earlier he would witness such an unbelievable scene.</p><br/><p>He lazily climbed up the stairs and walked along the corridor to his classroom. With one foot through the classroom door he looked up and saw \u2014\u2014- His beloved desk partner currently sneaking a bag of black things into his desk.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was instantly stunned. Like he was suddenly electrocuted, he instantly sobered up and a few crazy thoughts appeared in his mind.</p><br/><p>The breakfast in my desk over the past few days were from Jiang Yang? Not from a girl with a crush on me? Why?! Doesn\u2019t he hate me?! Was it just my misunderstanding this whole time?!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu continued to be dazed. Like he was in a dream, he felt light and fluttery. It was a very incredible feeling.</p><br/><p>Only after a long time was he was able to calm his emotions down.</p><br/><p>\u201cXu brother, so early?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was Xie Zhe\u2019s voice. He came over and patted Qin Xu\u2019s shoulder. He was quite surprised and at first he even thought he was mistaken but it really turned out to be Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>After sending out his greetings, he saw that Qin Xu had no reaction. Xie Zhe very quickly remembered that he usually would be in a bad mood after waking up so he timidly retracted his hands while getting ready to slip away.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Qin Xu suddenly asked: \u201cYou said before that the breakfast left in my desk is from a girl with a crush on me right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe was confused and wondered why he would suddenly ask this but he decided to answer his question first: \u201cOf course otherwise who else could it be? Why would they buy you breakfast for no reason?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at Qin Xu waiting for him to ask him the next question but Qin Xu only pursed his mouth and returned to his seat. Xie Zhe was speechless. What is this? Is he showing off how many admirers he has?</p><br/><p>This time, Qin Xu sat down but did not ignore Jiang Yang. Instead, he took the initiative to speak, \u201cJiang Yang, what did you have for breakfast?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang frowned and looked at him strangely. He looked at him like he was looking at a mental patient who had forgotten to take his medications. He answered coldly: \u201cSteamed vermicelli roll.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu very naturally pulled out the bag of glutinous rice with chicken from his desk. Just now, Jiang Yang had stuffed that bag into his seat. He then casually said: \u201cToday is glutinous rice with chicken. I like this the most.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jian Yang calmly responded with an \u2018Oh\u2019 and continued acting indifferent. He wanted to roll his eyes. What does that have to do with him?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu continued asking: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you eat glutinous rice with chicken?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang impatiently responded: \u201cI had it yesterday.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu figured that that was probably the case. Their preferences were very similar and Jiang Yang also liked to eat glutinous rice with chicken. However, possibly because he is afraid of being found out, he would deliberately buy two different ones. But why? Why would Jiang Yang suddenly want to buy him breakfast? This both surprised him and made him curious. Like a cat constantly clawing at his heart, he really wanted to know.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu then proceeded to peel open the lotus leaf and actually ate the glutinous rice with chicken. The aromatic smell spread through the classroom and was very enticing.</p><br/><p>This time, it was Jiang Yang\u2019s turn to be surprised. Doesn\u2019t he reject it every time? Why is he suddenly eating it today?</p><br/><p>The task assigned by the system was for him to buy him breakfast. It wasn\u2019t very strict; as long as he successfully delivered it to Jiang Yang, even if he doesn\u2019t eat it, it would be considered as successfully completing the task. Jiang Yang didn\u2019t care if he throws it away or gives it to someone else. What\u2019s more, if Qin Xu threw it away it would actually reduce the burden in his heart.</p><br/><p>But today, Qin Xu who didn\u2019t normally accept things from his secret admirers actually ate it. It was too strange. Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but glance at him from the corner of his eyes a few more times as if he doubted what he was seeing.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu obviously sensed his gaze and deliberately ate with gusto while probing out his reaction. For some reason, despite being in bad mood after waking up, his mood had improved significantly after entering the classroom and seeing a warm breakfast prepared for him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang poked at his book with his pen a few times and finally couldn\u2019t resist asking: \u201cWhy did you eat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu acted natural: \u201cThis is someone\u2019s heartfelt goodwill. How can I reject it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d It\u2019s just a task! There was no heartfelt goodwill!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu also seemingly noticed that there were too many issues with what he had just said and added, \u201cI like today\u2019s glutinous rice with chicken.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.Oh.\u201d</p><br/><p>After coldly responding, he turned away and slightly regretted asking that question. What does it have to do with him whether he eats it or not? What was the point of asking?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu on the other hand continued to eat while pondering over something in his mind.</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong>Qin Xu: Aiya, it looks like Jiang Yang likes me but is too embarrassed. Looks like I should take the initiative~</p><br/><p>The like in this case is not that type of like. Qin Xu had not thought that far and just figured that Jiang Yang probably wanted to reconcile and felt extremely happy inside.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

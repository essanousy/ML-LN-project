He packed it into a box before putting it into a gift bag and handed it over.</p><br/><p>Finally, the arduous ear-piercing journey had come to an end. Jiang Yang\u2019s eyes were red and his earlobes were also red. With a cold expression, he walked out the store. From the beginning to the end, he had not spoken a word to Qin Xu. Qin Xu peeked at him from the side and couldn\u2019t help but admit that despite the expression being quite unhappy, he looked very handsome and felt very satisfied with the idea of getting his ears pierced.</p><br/><p>On the way back, they sat at the back of the car and both were a little absent-minded. Qin Xu unconsciously rubbed his fingers along the handle of the bag while he mulled over something when his phone started ringing. He reflexively answered the phone and hung up after a few short responses.</p><br/><p>By the time he returned to his senses, he became a little stunned. The calm expression on his face faded and, no longer as complacent as earlier, he turned towards Jiang Yang with a guilty conscience and nudged Jiang Yang\u2019s shoulder.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at him coldly.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled stiffly, \u201cEarlier, I received a call from your mother. She said that your uncle brought over chicken. She made soup and wanted you to go home to have some\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang instantly grabbed onto his hand and the veins on both his hands and forehead appeared to protrude in anger. With a look of fury, he asked, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say so earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>He may be able to guide Qin Xu through the ordeal, but that guy is stupid to the point that he wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he couldn\u2019t handle it.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s wrist hurt, and he guiltily rubbed his nose. Afraid that he would end up getting beaten to death, he didn\u2019t dare say that he was too preoccupied recalling Jiang Yang\u2019s tearful appearance earlier. Although Jiang Yang wasn\u2019t very polite, this was a normal interaction between the two boys and this made Qin Xu felt a little happy inside.</p><br/><p>He handed the phone over and said good-heartedly, \u201cCall back?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment, Jiang Yang was barely able to calm himself down. He understood his mother\u2019s personality well. Although she loves her children dearly, she would also sometimes be very strict and surprisingly harsh. If you don\u2019t listen to her, you would find yourself faced with cold violence. For example \u2014\u2014- I told you that the milk tea is made from milk powder and the pearls are plastic. It\u2019s bad for your body so you can\u2019t drink it. You still want to drink? Then I\u2019m not going to make dinner tonight. Let\u2019s see what you do now.</p><br/><p>So for something like Mother Jiang\u2019s highly respected chicken soup, unless you have a good excuse, if you don\u2019t go home to have some then you would be considered as being unfilial and disrespectful. Afterwards, you wait for your death.</p><br/><p>Mother Jiang is just that domineering.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t take the phone and just threw away Qin Xu\u2019s hand. He held his forehead, \u201cForget it. I\u2019ll go back with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo back? Back to your place?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Qin Xu wondered. Wasn\u2019t he afraid of being exposed?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense. If you ask any more questions, you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had a look of impatience. After informing the driver the new address, he supported his chin and pondered over what he should do. Qin Xu watched him mull over things in silence and felt extremely curious. He didn\u2019t have any aversion at the idea of going to Jiang Yang\u2019s place, instead he felt slightly expectant?</p><br/><p>The driver at the front overhead their conversation and didn\u2019t find things strange. He just thought that youngsters nowadays talk to each other very strangely. It was just like his child back at home. When talking about his mum to him he wouldn\u2019t say \u2018mum\u2019. Instead he would say, \u2018your wife.\u2019. The driver even thought that Jiang Yang and Qin Xu must be close cousins.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at Jiang Yang\u2019s place, Qin Xu followed Jiang Yang\u2019s instructions and immediately introduced \u2018Qin Xu\u2019.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang said with a polite smile: \u201cHello Aunty.\u201d At the same time, he felt particularly awkward inside.</p><br/><p>Mother Jiang saw the unexpected guest and welcomed him in enthusiastically. She had always been very hospitable. She turned her head around and reprimanded her son for not notifying her in advance, especially since he had stayed overnight at that classmates place the day before. She asked: \u201cDid Ah Yang trouble you last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang instantly shook his head.</p><br/><p>Mother Jiang smiled and said: \u201cThat\u2019s good. Come, lets go at eat. The chicken soup should be ready now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yuan sat on the side chewing on dried squid and, seeing her brother bring in the rumoured school idol that he didn\u2019t get along with, her eyes suddenly lit up. It was as if she anticipated some juicy gossip. It\u2019s no wonder the girls in her class constantly commented that it was like they were in a TV drama and that they were extremely handsome. The names of those two boys were naturally mentioned as the girls gossiped but, having grown up together with her brother, Jiang Yang had long become accustomed to his handsome face and felt nothing of it. However, the first time she saw Qin Xu she was amazed by his appearance. He practically looked like a celebrity who would soon debut.</p><br/><p>With Qin Xu\u2019s identity, Jiang Yang entered his own home. Although he intentionally controlled himself and acted like it was his first time here, it was a place that he could walk around with his eyes closed so if you looked closely enough, you would notice that something is off. With his mind filled with worry for Qin Xu he would give him a few pointers when no one else is paying attention.</p><br/><p>Because of this, Jiang Yuan who watched from the side found it a little strange. This classmate of brothers, why does it seem like he\u2019s familiar with our place? If I remembered correctly, this is the first time he visited?</p><br/><p>Everyone sat down at the dining table and Jiang Yang sat next to Qin Xu. Because they didn\u2019t know that there would be a guest, all the dishes today were home-cooked meals that the Jiang family loved; shredded chicken, sweet and sour pork, stir fried carrots with meat, stir fried fungus with meat and grilled squid.</p><br/><p>Mother Jiang smiled and placed a piece of chicken into Jiang Yang\u2019s bowl: \u201cQin Xu, feel free to grab what you like. Don\u2019t be too polite and eat more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang nodded and said: \u201cThank you Aunty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Next to him the real guest had to act as if he is familiar with the family and could only silently eat his own food. Fortunately, Qin Xu\u2019s ability to adapt is strong and he quickly adapted to the new environment.</p><br/><p>After eating for a while, Jiang Yuan suddenly pouted and said: \u201cBrother, why aren\u2019t you eating the carrots? Is it because you noticed that it was made by me so you\u2019re not eating it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Jiang looked over and noticed that \u201cJiang Yang\u201d really hadn\u2019t picked up the carrots. She quickly said: \u201cIt\u2019s pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, grabbing a large bunch with her chopsticks, she placed it all into Qin Xu\u2019s bowl. Qin Xu smelled the unique smell of carrots and couldn\u2019t help but frown, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang heard this and soon remembered that this guy had always avoided carrots in first year and even said that carrots had a peculiar taste that he disliked. Jiang Yang however likes carrots. Wouldn\u2019t it be strange if he suddenly said that he didn\u2019t like it?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang quickly held him down and forced a smile: \u201cJiang Yang, don\u2019t you love carrots?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

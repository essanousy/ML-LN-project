Wait, I\u2019m going to send him a screenshot.\u201d</p><br/><p>And so, Huang Shao who was enjoying his weekend lazily at home suddenly received a message in the group chat \u2014- \u201cLook, even an elementary school student is better than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao immediately replied with a crying expression. The figure knelt onto the ground while using a handkerchief to wipe its tears, \u201cYou\u2019re too much! How can abandon me and go find another person to play with? I can\u2019t live anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, a bunch of comments followed from the other members in the group chat.</p><br/><p>\u201cGo divorce.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c+1\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll prepare the champagne to celebrate Jiang Yang finally leaving this unfortunate life.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet\u2019s hold a single\u2019s celebration party for Jiang Yang! Cheers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCheers!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSong linked: Happy break up\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI have the playlist prepared for the singles party [smirk]\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu saw messages appearing non-stop on his phone screen and selected it to check what the commotion was all about. The moment he entered the chat, he saw Huang Shao complaining that the others are too heartless. Qin Xu laughed and, after thinking for a moment, moved his fingers to send out a message.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat single life? The official wife is here. Where did that cheap mistress come from? Bring him outside and execute him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The group fell silent for a second and then the screen was instantly covered with laughter.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe majesty is here, who dares to be so presumptuous!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Huang, you\u2019re so bold. You actually dare to climb into the dragon\u2019s bed!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cRemember the marriage ceremony by the Da Ming lake?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c[Image]\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c[Image]\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is evidence of the wedding.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was at this moment that Huang Shao realised that he was not the only one in the group who likes to be dramatic and he quickly started crying out that its unfair with so many people against one.</p><br/><p>After mucking around for a while, then continued to play few more rounds. Jiang Yang saw that it was about time to leave and notified Qin Xu about it.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu however did not say goodbye. Instead, he pointed in a direction: \u201cYour place is in that direction, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang nodded.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu curved his lips up and smiled: \u201cThen we are going in the same direction. I have to drop these two guys off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang naturally had no reason to refuse but for a moment he felt a strange feeling emerge from inside him. They were clearly deadly enemies not long ago but now they\u2019ve reached a point that they can harmoniously head back home together. Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but shiver. The beautiful image of the two brothers walking down the street with arms across each other\u2019s shoulders that suddenly appeared in his mind made his scalp go numb.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu tilted his head and asked: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang shook his head as if nothing had happened, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then calmly took the lead and started heading off. The small poodle followed him cheerfully from behind with his small legs pattering along excitedly.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu rolled his eyes at his own dog in annoyance. If anyone else saw this, they would automatically assume that Jiang Yang is the owner. But\u2026..forget it. At least this stupid dog is acting stupid to the right person.</p><br/><p>They walked along and, after turning the corner, an aromatic scent drifted over. Several street stalls sat by the road while the boss busily prepared the food. The rich aroma drifted along with the evening wind and, the moment it reached their nose, their mouths couldn\u2019t help but water.</p><br/><p>The small child next to Qin Xu blinked a few times and swallowed before tugging at Qin Xu\u2019s hand: \u201cI\u2019m tired from walking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu immediately understood the hidden intentions behind those words. He acted dense and said: \u201cOh, then do you want me to carry you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Hao shook his head and then asked straightforwardly: \u201cUncle, did you hear that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu raised his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>Qin Hao with wide and innocent eyes said: \u201cThe sound of my stomach.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu continued to act confused, \u201cReally? I don\u2019t hear anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Hao pouted and sighed bitterly, \u201cThat\u2019s understandable. Only smart people can hear it. It can\u2019t be helped that uncle is stupid.\u201d Speaking in a such a serious manner, even the adults listening to his words would believe it. That is, of course, if he stops drooling while looking at the street stalls.</p><br/><p>The moment he finished saying this, he was immediately rewarded with a knock in the head from Qin Xu. He looked down and asked faintly: \u201cDo you still want to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Hao didn\u2019t care about the pain on his head and proceeded to quickly embrace Qin Xu\u2019s thigh while exclaiming: \u201cEat, eat, eat! Uncle you are the handsomest, the best!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d This little rascal really will do anything to be able to eat.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang, with the small poodle hanging on his pant leg, watched the whole process and secretly laughed. Internally he ridculed \u2014- With an uncle like that, it\u2019s not surprising that his nephew is like this too.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Qin Xu\u2019s eyes moved over to him. Without even needing to say anything, Jiang Yang understood what he wanted to say. The three people plus one dog tacitly moved to find a place to seat and they waved to the owner: \u201cThree bowls of seafood noodles please.\u201d</p><br/><p>The hard-at-work boss looked up for a second from what he was doing and deftly answered: \u201cGot it!\u201d</p><br/><p>By the time they got the little rascal and dog to settle down, the freshly made noodles have already been served up on their table. Inside the foil bowl were slender, crystal-clear strands of vermicelli which is coated with fragrant clams, mushrooms and garnished with green onion and coriander. A layer of red chilli oil floated on the surface. Without even needing to have a taste, you could already feel the chilli sensation on your tongue.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu randomly extracted three pairs of bamboo chopsticks from the container and passed it over to Jiang Yang and the little rascal. They removed the plastic covering from it and started to concentrate on eating. Food of course should be enjoyed while they are still hot.</p><br/><p>The clam meat was delicious and fresh with a smooth and chewy texture while the soup is adequately spicy to pair with the noodles. Using the chopsticks to pick it up, the moment it enters your mouth it was very refreshing.</p><br/><p>Not long afterwards, a thin layer of sweat formed across their foreheads. With the cool evening wind blowing past, it just happened to help with cooling them down. On the plate next to them, a small mountain of clam shells formed. Every time they finished a clam and used their chopsticks to add it onto the pile, it would make a soft clattering sound.</p><br/><p>As Qin Hao ate, he deliberately passed his clam shells over to Qin Xu\u2019s pile. Forming a large tower, he chuckled while revealing his canine: \u201cYou ate all that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s response was naturally a big eye roll.</p><br/><p>When he was halfway through the noodles, Jiang Yang inadvertently looked up and noticed that the boss and the stall had disappeared.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was shocked. He looked at the noodles in front of him and back at where the street stall used to be. His heart quickly went cold \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 A ghost shop?!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu used his chopsticks and slurped up some noodles. Seeing that his expression didn\u2019t look too good, he deliberately smirked and teased: \u201cDid you see a ghost?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Where\u2019s the boss?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu had his mouth filled with food and his cheeks were round like dumplings. He vaguely answered: \u201cProbably running away from the officials.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was stunned. He looked around him and saw that all the other street stalls by the roadside had also disappeared without a trace.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked around at the street that only consisted of the table they were sitting at and felt very strange. Anyway, he felt helpless and had the urge to laugh, \u201cLuckily we already paid for the food. Otherwise it would be a loss for the boss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu remembered something and suddenly laughed, \u201cSpeaking of that, there was one time when I bought pancakes and, just as I paid for it, the officers came. The boss packed up his cart and ran and even yelled at me telling me to follow him and he will make it for me up ahead. I chased after him for at least 800 metres and was both hungry and tired. It really isn\u2019t easy running a business.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang stifled a laugh and raised his eyebrow, \u201cLooks like you\u2019re quite experienced.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. There are only a few barbeque restaurants and street stand near my place, so I have pretty much been to all of them.\u201d Qin Xu raised his chin and seemingly looked proud.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was amused by this, but he soon remembered that Qin Xu\u2019s parents are usually not at home, so it was natural for him to have takeaways often. Last time he had mentioned that he could cook but Jiang Yang was certain that even if he can, he was probably too lazy to. Thinking this, Jiang Yang\u2019s smiled stiffened for a moment, but he quickly deliberately bent his lips into a smile and acted as if nothing had happened, \u201cThen you should do a ranking for the food there. Recommend me a few and I\u2019ll check them out next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou have asked the right person.\u201d Without even needing to think, Qin Xu fluidly started speaking. He started talking about which stores tasted more authentic, what their signature dishes were and what he liked personally.</p><br/><p>They chatted as they ate, and another half an hour passed. It was only when the small Qin Hao who sat on the side started rubbing his eyes while yawning did they stop. The walked until a fork in the road and prepared to part ways.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu had both a little child and a dog with him. Unfortunately, a certain poodle isn\u2019t very cooperative, and it held onto Jiang Yang\u2019s pant leg unwilling to let go. Qin Xu pulled at it for a long time but was unsuccessful. Qin Xu was annoyed by this dumb dog and just threw his leash over, \u201cFine, I don\u2019t want you anymore. You can go home with your new dad.\u201d</p><br/><p>The poodle froze for a moment and then, as if it understood Qin Xu\u2019s words, its tail wagged even harder and it proceeded to hug onto Jiang Yang\u2019s leg while barking. It seemingly looked like it was crying out \u201cYay!\u201d.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu scoffed at the sight of this.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang smiled awkwardly.</p><br/><p>Although he said this, Qin Xu obviously wouldn\u2019t really throw the dog away. After all, he still had to bring the dog back to complete his task. And so, he stepped forward and heartlessly pulled its claws off before proceeding to hold the dog under his arms. He looked at Jiang Yang, smiled and said goodbye before leaving with large strides.</p><br/><p>The poodle whined pitifully as if they had just taken away his favourite toy. For a moment, Qin Xu suspected that he had accidentally bought a dog demon instead.</p><br/><p>On Sunday morning, Jiang Yang was awakened by the system. He glanced at the clock and saw that it was only 8am and proceeded to close his eyes and go back to sleep. Less than two minutes later, another notification from the system sounded in his head. The system said: \u201cRandom task: Please have breakfast with Qin Xu. Time limit is thirty minutes. If you fail to do so, there will be a punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t want to get up. He vaguely heard the words spoken by the system, rolled over and muttered a few incoherent words before continuing to sleep. After ten minutes had passed, the system again sent a reminder: \u201cYou\u2019re really not doing the task? Today\u2019s punishment is one that you won\u2019t like. Don\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t warn you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang frowned. In a confused state, he only reacted a few seconds later. He asked slowly: \u201cWhat punishment?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCrossdressing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had his face half sunken into his pillow and was sleeping very comfortably. He opened his eyes and only realised that something was wrong a minute later. He furrowed his brows and suspected that he had heard wrong, \u201cWhat did you just say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The system didn\u2019t notice his shock and disbelief and patiently explained: \u201cCrossdressing. Just like that classmate Wu Tong of yours. A trap. Do you understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s eyes widened, and he quickly let out a curse as he immediately jumped off his bed. Cursing endlessly inside, his hands moved around at a fast speed. He messily changed his clothes and cried out: \u201cI would rather die than wear a dress. If I fail, I will do my best to kill you!\u201d</p><br/><p>The system replied a little awkwardly: \u201cYou actually had enough time for it but you wouldn\u2019t wake up\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cUncle, it\u2019s only eight right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang continued to curse at the system as he rushed into the bathroom to wash up. With a toothbrush dangling from his mouth and the corners of his lips covered in foam, he suddenly cried out and ran into his bedroom. He picked up the phone and called Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>Pick up! Pick up! Why are you not picking up?!</p><br/><p>On Qin Xu\u2019s end he couldn\u2019t feel any sense of urgency. He slowly picked up the phone when the ring tone was about to stop and with a hoarse and half-asleep voice he answered gruffly: \u201cI\u2019m sleeping. If it\u2019s nothing important, don\u2019t bother me. Hanging up now\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou dare hang up?!\u201d Jiang Yang roared.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu paused for a moment. That pause sounded like it lasted for eternity. Seemingly in a better mood now, his sexy magnetic voice even carried a tone of laughter, \u201cXiao Yang Yang, why are you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t have the time to joke around with him. He answered in the fastest and most concise manner possible: \u201cBreakfast together. Task. Get up! Now! Immediately!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu hummed vaguely and rolled around in his bed a few times before answering, \u201cOk, I\u2019ll get up.\u201d</p><br/><p>He hung up and Jiang Yang once again washed up ferociously while continuously keeping an eye on the time. Because he had neglected the task when it was initially announced, he had missed ten minutes, so time appeared to fly by even faster than usual.</p><br/><p>There was only ten minutes left.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had already reached the porch and was ready to leave. At this moment, he remembered that he had not set a location for him to meet with Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>He once again pulled out his phone and called over. The phone this time rang for more than half a minute and Jiang Yang suddenly had a bed feeling. Sure enough, when the call connected, Qin Xu\u2019s voice that carried over was still vague and filled with drowsiness. It was clear that he had not woken up yet!</p><br/><p>The voice that would easily move the hearts of numerous girls didn\u2019t have such an effect on Jiang Yang. Hearing that voice, Jiang Yang instead had the urge to reach through the phone and beat him up until he wakes up.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re still not up?! Are you a pig? Why are you sleeping so much?!\u201d Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but yell out.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu replied innocently, \u201cIt\u2019s only eight o\u2019clock and it\u2019s the weekend. I normally sleep until twelve.\u201d</p><br/><p>Sleeping until noon and waking up normally on weekends was something that Jiang Yang could relate with. Unfortunately, the situation right now is different, and they had already wasted half the time. It was definitely not enough time for him to head over to Qin Xu\u2019s place so the two must head out and meet in the middle to make it on time.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother, where are you going so early in the morning?\u201d Jiang Yuan was woken up by Jiang Yang\u2019s yells and she stood outside her bedroom in her pyjamas while yawning.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang stifled his anger and calmly replied: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You can continue sleeping.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yuan squinted her eyes and sleepily replied okay before turning back to her room.</p><br/><p>Watching her go back inside, Jiang Yang also understood that getting angry was pointless. He supressed his anger and continued speaking to Qin Xu: \u201cThere\u2019s no time. I know you want to sleep but didn\u2019t we already agree that we\u2019re going to help each other out? Get up immediately and I\u2019ll do my best to cooperate next time you have a task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu sat up and glanced at his phone. With a hint of smile in his eyes he asked, \u201cSo you\u2019re saying that if I help you this time, you will fulfil a request of mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang wondered, when did he say something like that?</p><br/><p>But because there wasn\u2019t much time, Jiang Yang no longer cared and just casually accepted: \u201cThat\u2019s right, as long as it is something I am capable of doing. I\u2019m heading off now and I\u2019ll buy breakfast on the way to your place. How long will you take?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was now completely awake and for once, he was not in a bad mood. In a pretty good mood he grunted, \u201cRemember your words. I just need five minutes to get ready. I\u2019ll share my location with you later.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>They cleanly hung up. Qin Xu hummed a small tune as he walked into the bathroom. Although the tune was slow paced, his hands moved very quickly. Jiang Yang on the other hand called for a taxi and grabbed two bags of bread and milk as he waited for the taxi to come. He quickly hopped onto the car and directed it to Qin Xu\u2019s place.</p><br/><p>Along the way, Jiang Yang kept looking at his phone to check the time and Qin Xu\u2019s location. He couldn\u2019t help but urge the driver, \u201cCan you drive any faster?\u201d</p><br/><p>After asking this several times, the driver found it a little strange, \u201cI\u2019m about to get a speeding ticket at this rate. Handsome, where are you going in such a hurry? You just happened to leave at peak hour when everyone is heading to work.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t want to answer but he soon changed his mind. He quickly made a sad and anxious expression, \u201cMy girlfriend wants to break up with me and she gave me a time limit. There\u2019s only five minutes left. If I don\u2019t make it on time, I\u2019ll regret this for the rest of my life! So please master, please drive as fast as you can!\u201d</p><br/><p>The uncle was surprised and couldn\u2019t help but nod his head. Internally, he felt rather nostalgic: Ah, young love.</p><br/><p>A variety of expressions flashed through the uncles face as he reminisced about his past. He gritted his teeth and solemnly said: \u201cDon\u2019t worry handsome. I won\u2019t let you break up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The uncle then stepped onto the gas pedal and the car sped up. The speedometer hand lifted up and stopped just on the verge of speeding.</p><br/><p>Because of inertia, Jiang Yang was thrown back into his seat. Although he suspected the uncle probably imagined a whole bunch of ridiculous scenarios and wanted to do his best to help him, Jiang Yang decided that it was best if he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>With the uncles\u2019 enthusiasm, Jiang Yang managed to arrive a little earlier than expected. Qin Xu had arrived a minute earlier and was already waiting for Jiang Yang at the predetermined location.</p><br/><p>When the driver stopped, Qin Xu who was leaning on the railing by the side of the road yawned and saw Jiang Yang climb out. He raised his hand and waved to direct his attention.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang immediately got off the taxi. When he closed the door, he gave the uncle his thanks.</p><br/><p>The uncle was not happy. He couldn\u2019t help but feel like he was cheated. Pointing at Qin Xu he asked: \u201cThis is the girlfriend that wanted to break up with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had a complicated expression and he didn\u2019t know how to explain his situation. Qin Xu heard the words girlfriend when he walked over and vaguely guessed what had happened. He laughed and reached over to hold Jiang Yang\u2019s waist while acknowledging, \u201cThat\u2019s right. I am his \u2018girl\u2019 friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>That low pitched voice was obviously a male voice, yet he deliberately emphasised the word \u2018girl\u2019.</p><br/><p>The uncle looked at them in confusion for a while and, perhaps because he had imagined more scenarios in his mind, he suddenly was no longer angry. Instead, he shook his head while sighing: \u201cI\u2019m getting old. It\u2019s you youngsters\u2019 era now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he prepared to drive off, he again looked up and said sincerely: \u201cYour future paths will be more difficult compared to the others. You should accept and be more tolerant of each other and don\u2019t get into arguments so easily. This uncle here gives you his blessings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, the car sped off. Like its owner, it drove off without leaving a trace behind.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment of confusion, Jiang Yang finally realised what the driver was referring to. His face flushed with embarrassment and he quickly elbowed Qin Xu, \u201cWhat nonsense are you spouting?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu agilely dodged his attack and then shrugged with a smile on his face, \u201cWhat nonsense? You\u2019re the one who said it first. Instead of thanking me, you actually try to hit me? But I have to say, that uncle\u2019s words are very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang snorted coldly. He didn\u2019t have the time to bicker with him. He pushed the plastic bag over to him and said irritably: \u201cHurry and eat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu received it and then pulled him to one side with a smile. He then pulled out a carton of milk out and placed it in Jiang Yang\u2019s hand, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say that we need to eat it together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang pursed his lips and pulled off the straw. He intended to rip the plastic wrapping off the straw and then piercing the carton to take a drink.</p><br/><p>But at this moment, a mechanical sound appeared in his mind.</p><br/><p>\u201cTask failed. Now starting the punishment: Crossdress for one day and don\u2019t let anyone else find out your real identity. Also, please don\u2019t worry, no-one will notice the moment you change.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang bowed his head down and cursed reflexively.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu turned over to look at him. He was very glad that he had not yet taken a drink of the milk or he would have spat it all out. Jiang Yang who stood next to him had suddenly changed without a warning.</p><br/><p>The short hedgehog-like hair had turned into dark shoulder length hair. It was silky and smooth and there was even a half-up bun with a few strands of black hair falling past his cheeks. He wore a long black and white oversized t-shirt giving it a boyfriend style feel and below the shirt was a pair of long, straight legs. Despite the sharp looking eyes and irritated expression, you couldn\u2019t help but think that he is an amazing beauty.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang noticed the strange look coming from him and immediately glared back. With a harsh tone he threatened: \u201cWhat are you looking at?!\u201d</p><br/><p>That aggressive tone of his made it seem as if he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to make the other party blind if he continued to stare. Qin Xu however wasn\u2019t angry nor scared. Instead, he was both surprised and curious. He noticed that even his voice had changed into a magnetic husky voice.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu looked on and his heart started beating very fast. He quickly looked away as he tried to hide his hot ears. Along with his racing heart, his palms were sweaty, his mind went blank and he could feel his whole body get warmer and warmer.</p><br/><p>At this moment, he suddenly realised that if Jiang Yang was a woman, he probably would have liked him\u2026.not only that, he would have fallen for him deeply.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Jiang Yang didn\u2019t have the ability to read other peoples\u2019 minds and consequently he didn\u2019t know what Qin Xu was thinking. He only saw that his eyes suddenly brightened for a moment and subconsciously though that he was laughing at him and was very unhappy.</p><br/><p>The task had already been deemed to have been failed and he naturally wasn\u2019t in the mood to have breakfast. With a humph, he turned around and wanted to leave.</p><br/><p>When Qin Xu finally returned to his senses, before he could think of anything his hand had already reached out to grab onto Jiang Yang\u2019s wrist to stop him.</p><br/><p>Although the system had made changes to Jiang Yang\u2019s appearance, his actual being wasn\u2019t modified. When he grabbed onto Jiang Yang, what he grabbed onto wasn\u2019t a girls soft and slender wrist. Instead it was the hand that he had come into contact with often when they fought; muscular, firm and strong. When he came into contact with this familiar sensation, Qin Xu inexplicably breathed a sigh of relief and was glad that it was still the Jiang Yang that he knew.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was grabbed onto and his conditional reflex was to counterattack. He grabbed onto Qin Xu\u2019s forearm and, at the same time, used his strength to pull his arm out of his grip. With a sweeping move, his legs aimed for Qin Xu\u2019s knees.</p><br/><p>That set of actions was something Qin Xu had dealt with many times. Normally he would be able to easily counteract that attack of his but, because he was temporarily distracted, Jiang Yang\u2019s attack this time managed to connect. Jiang Yang frowned in dissatisfaction at his momentary distraction, \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled as he leaned back to dodge another blow. Using the opportunity in between his attacks, he looped his hand around Jiang Yang\u2019s waist and once again stopped him, \u201cBe careful you don\u2019t expose yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang glared back: \u201cI have pants on!\u201d</p><br/><p>But the moment he finished saying that, he felt even more infuriated. Perhaps it was because he had threatened the system earlier but the cross-dressing punishment didn\u2019t force him into wearing a dress. However, he had shorts on that basically disappeared under his shirt, so it looked no different from wearing a dress. At the very least, this would be the case to onlookers despite he himself knowing that he has pants on. The system once again stepped on the edge of his bottom line and Jiang Yang felt the urge to bust its ass.</p><br/><p>Explaining something as embarrassing as this, he would much rather not say anything!</p><br/><p>Sure enough, as soon as he finished saying that, Qin Xu subconsciously looked down past his long t-shirt. Jiang Yang immediately threw a fist over.</p><br/><p>They ignored the look of bystanders and threw blows back at forth. The onlookers couldn\u2019t help but whisper: \u201cA lovers fight? They\u2019re so good looking.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWow, that sister is so handsome!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s a sister? Looks pretty domineering.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook carefully. She has a chest.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe clothes are just loose. Look from the side, the side!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t see it. I don\u2019t care. I believe that its two brothers. What a good-looking pair.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang vaguely heard the soft whispers of the onlookers and couldn\u2019t help but frown. He hated being watched and commented about. Qin Xu saw this and easily guessed that was going through Jiang Yang\u2019s mind. He didn\u2019t mind it himself but since Jiang Yang doesn\u2019t like it then\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Qin Xu suddenly came up from behind Jiang Yang and, with his arms around his waist, lifted him up. He then realised \u2014\u2014\u2013 Jiang Yang is too tall and his feet dragged on the ground. It wouldn\u2019t be easy to walk like this.</p><br/><p>Comic books are all a big lie! Clearly it looked so easy carrying someone with one hand!</p><br/><p>And so, Qin Xu opted for the next option. He placed the person down and then quickly bent down to carry Jiang Yang over his shoulder. He even used his palm to support his back to avoid him falling off.</p><br/><p>The onlookers around them exclaimed in amazement.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d His face was filled with confusion after suddenly being carried like a bag of rice.</p><br/><p>After a stunned moment, he immediately started to struggle. In such a situation, if he used his fists to hit him it would be too girly and something that is commonly seen on TV dramas. Jiang Yang endured this urge and used his feet to kick while roaring out: \u201cAre you fucking crazy?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled innocently and grabbed onto his ankle with one hand, \u201cI\u2019m helping you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang became even more annoyed: \u201cYou think I\u2019m blind?! I don\u2019t see it at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also can\u2019t help it. You won\u2019t calm down to listen to me, so I could only do this.\u201d Qin Xu continued to answer seriously. It was just that the tone of his voice sounded like he was bullshitting, \u201cIf I don\u2019t lug you over my shoulder, did you want me to princess carry you? I think I might be beaten to death if I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang scoffed coldly and the meaning behind it is self-evident.</p><br/><p>\u201cEarlier, you intended to go home? But with your current appearance, how are you going to explain it to your acquaintances?\u201d Qin Xu said slowly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s movements stopped. He was too preoccupied with his anger and hadn\u2019t thought that far. At this moment, he realised that he was being too impulsive and the last place he should be going to was his own home.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu felt him stop moving and laughed: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll take you in. As many days as you need.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang replied in disdain: \u201cI\u2019ll be like this for just a day. I can just go to a hotel.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu asked: \u201cDid you bring your ID with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang again stiffened and was at lost for words. He didn\u2019t have the habit of taking his ID with him.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201cCome to my place. Who knows if another task will be sent out today. Wasn\u2019t it because we were to far away that we couldn\u2019t complete this one on time?\u201d</p><br/><p>What he said made sense and Jiang Yang also had to agree so he didn\u2019t say anything and just patted his back. With a faint voice he said: \u201cLet me down first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu said: \u201cThen promise that you won\u2019t run or hit me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang snorted and nodded somewhat unwillingly, \u201cOkay\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Qin Xu held onto him, bent down, and let him back down onto the ground. Because of his earlier struggles, Jiang Yang\u2019s shirt was loose and wrinkled, his cheeks blushed faintly, and his forehead was covered in a thin layer of sweat. The semi-wet black hair stuck onto his face, adding to his sexiness.</p><br/><p>The loose t-shirt revealed his slender neck and delicate collarbone. There was also the vague presence of a chest that seemingly disappeared and appeared each time you looked at it. Qin Xu recalled that when he held Jiang Yang earlier, he didn\u2019t feel a soft sensation on his back but earlier he was also too preoccupied with stabilising him and didn\u2019t pay it much attention.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu couldn\u2019t help but be curious. He asked: \u201cDid your chest change as well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang saw his look of eagerness and the veins on his forehead throbbed with anger. Forgetting about his earlier promise not to hit him, he threw a punch at Qin Xu\u2019s stomach and warned through gritted teeth: \u201cIf you dare touch it, I will kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Qin Xu dodged his attack on time and it had only brushed his sides. He didn\u2019t pay it much attention and just nodded understandingly: \u201cOkay I won\u2019t touch\u2026.But what haven\u2019t I touched on your body? There\u2019s no need to be embarrassed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Embarrassed your big uncle!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang roared this out internally. He felt that the system really was not reliable. Based on what damned data does it say that they would have a large likelihood of developing everlasting friendship? It\u2019s absolutely impossible! If he could manage not to beat him to death, then it already is an amazing feat for him!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang gritted his teeth and swore. Even if he swallowed his phone or lost all his rare game items, he would not be Qin Xu\u2019s friend!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu saw that Jiang Yang was about to explode in anger and immediately tried to placate him: \u201cSorry, I said too much. Don\u2019t be angry. Calm down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was fun to fight with Jiang Yang from time to time, it wasn\u2019t good to fight every time they saw each other. He still hoped that they could get along well and be able to sit down and talk every now and then.</p><br/><p>And so, Qin Xu recalled the words he had said this morning. He extended his index finger and reminded him, \u201cJiang Yang, didn\u2019t you say this morning that you would help with any request of mine? Then can you try and control yourself and fight less with me? It doesn\u2019t have to be no fighting completely but at least don\u2019t hit me every time you see me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo way.\u201d Jiang Yang cleanly rejected it while rolling his eyes, \u201cThe task had failed so it doesn\u2019t count. Also, it was something you said. I didn\u2019t mean it that way when I said it. As for fights\u2026\u2026. I have never been someone who would just casually beat another person up. It\u2019s because you are in deserving of a beating. If you could control your cheap mouth and middle-school mentality then I probably won\u2019t beat you to death, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he reached the end of his words, Jiang Yang curved up his lips and revealed a both threatening and polite smile.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Don\u2019t speak of it. He really can\u2019t control it!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang probably guessed that Qin Xu couldn\u2019t do it. He gave him a look and didn\u2019t say much but Qin Xu could tell based on his expression. Qin Xu pitifully rubbed his stomach. They had not had breakfast yet and he was hungry.</p><br/><p>And so, under Qin Xu\u2019s insistence, they sat at the nearest breakfast shop. Afraid of running into acquaintances, Jiang Yang didn\u2019t want to stay outside. Qin Xu patted his shoulder reassuringly while smiling and saying: \u201cBe at ease. How can it be that coincidental? After eating, we\u2019ll head back home.\u201d</p><br/><p>What he didn\u2019t realise was that those words immediately raised flag. Can\u2019t be that coincidental? The god will show you his capabilities!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was very hungry, and he proceeded to order multiple things. This included beef noodles, glutinous rice with chicken, xiao long bao, soy milk and fried oil sticks. Jiang Yang was still filled with anger, so he only ordered vermicelli noodles. Qin Xu wanted to ridicule him for his small appetite but the moment he opened his mouth, he was immediately glared at. He could only close his mouth obediently and stare at his face in silence.</p><br/><p>Because of the system, the mildly wheat coloured skin that he had painstakingly achieved had, in just one night, turned into a delicate and pale skin that seemingly glowed in the sun. Last time when Qin Xu went to his house, he had unintentionally come across some of his past photos and his skin now looked almost like the skin he had back then. It was pale and smooth, and Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but think that it\u2019s too feminine looking.</p><br/><p>There was a saying that paleness can cover ugliness. With Jiang Yang\u2019s changes, Qin Xu didn\u2019t pay attention to whether he had become prettier or not. Instead, he felt that that face of his was of his liking. Unfortunately, after becoming paler, Jiang Yang\u2019s glares no longer looked as threatening as it used to. Even if he rolled his eyes, Qin Xu couldn\u2019t help but find it rather soft and gentle.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was still lost in his thoughts when his face as suddenly pushed aside by a palm.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me.\u201d Jiang Yang warned domineeringly.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu saw him act like a haughty queen and couldn\u2019t help but laugh. As if he suddenly remembered something, he then said seriously: \u201cI was just looking because you have something on your face.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because he had said this quite seriously, Jiang Yang believed his words and reached out to rub his face, \u201cWhat\u2019s on my face?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGood looking\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026..\u201d Crazy bastard.</p><br/><p>He looked down and turned his attention to his phone and didn\u2019t bother giving any attention to the crazy idiot before him. However, that someone was like gum and naturally wouldn\u2019t give up so easily. His mouth started chattering on nonstop and cheesy lines flowed out continuously.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you hurting me like this?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang told himself not to give him any attention. He knew that if he gave him an inch, then he would definitely try to take a mile. Despite this, he couldn\u2019t control his mouth: \u201cDo I even need a reason? I don\u2019t like the look of you. Not only will I hurt you, I\u2019ll beat you until you can\u2019t move half your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu directly ignored his words and continued to look at him affectionately, \u201cI love you so much that it hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Goosebumps quickly formed on his arms. He couldn\u2019t help but be disgusted.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu wanted to continue but Jiang Yang glared at him with disgust, \u201cShut your mouth!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu however didn\u2019t take his threatening warning to heart. He responded even more enthusiastically while looking at him with bright eyes, \u201cEven if I shut my mouth, it\u2019s pointless. My love for you will pour out through my eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026.Go away.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGo away where? I have nowhere to go inside your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly felt tired. After consecutive cheesy attacks, his temper had calmed down. Jiang Yang asked with helplessness: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you think? Since you\u2019re going to beat me up anyway, I thought that I might as well make the most of my time before I go to heaven.\u201d Qin Xu laughed and answered seriously.</p><br/><p>This logic. I\u2019ll give it full marks.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu not only spouted cheesy lines, he also made lots of small movements. He rested his chin in his palms and reached out to hold Jiang Yang\u2019s hand on the table. Inserting his fingers one by one, he eventually formed the embarrassing interlocked handhold. At the same time, he looked at Jiang Yang with a smile and said, \u201cI like you.\u201d</p><br/><p>That smile of his was clean and handsome and, seemingly coated in honey, a thick sweet smell exuded from it causing the on-lookers to feel a little dizzy from the sweetness.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s body shivered for a moment and he only reacted after their hand was interlocked for a few seconds. Like he was zapped by electricity, he instantly retracted his hands and complained uncomfortable, \u201cYou\u2019re crazy.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the waiter had just brought their food over and both heard and saw what was going on. He couldn\u2019t help but smile. Inside he thought; he is only here to work. Why is he suddenly being force fed such sweet dog food? And to think that he\u2019s eating it quite happily!</p><br/><p>The waiter pretended to be calm as he placed the dishes on the table and, as he straightened himself back up, he sneaked a glance at the couple before turning to leave. The little brother is so handsome and flirty, and the little sister is so proud, so cute! I want to pack them up and take them home!!!!</p><br/><p>Despite the waiter\u2019s calm exterior, internally fireworks were exploding.</p><br/><p>Unaware of what was happening, one continued to tease the other while the other continued to respond with disgust. Despite all this, the two managed to finish their meal with relish.</p><br/><p>After paying the bill, they didn\u2019t walk too far from the breakfast shop when they ran into an acquaintance.</p><br/><p>Less than ten steps away.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong was holding onto He Shuo\u2019s hand as he looked at them with surprise.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang panicked. Without much thought, he looked over at Qin Xu and sent him a glare. You jinxed it!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d Feeling super guilty.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

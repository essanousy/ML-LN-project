Normally, even half a minute would make a huge difference so despite five minutes sounding very short, it was actually quite a deadly hit to them. By the time they had reached the cafeteria, they had completely missed the best timing and was forced to join in the peak hour chaos.</p><br/><p>In the cafeteria were crowds of people. Qin Xu and Xie Zhe grabbed their food and while carrying their plate over, they couldn\u2019t find a seat.</p><br/><p>While looking around, Huang Shao who sat to one side waved enthusiastically at them, \u201cXu brother, Xie Zhe, over here.\u201d</p><br/><p>His table just happened to have two spare seats.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang heard those words from Huang Shao who sat next to him and subconsciously looked over. The moment his eyes met with Qin Xu\u2019s, he frowned. He didn\u2019t want to sit share the table with him. Of the two seats that were free one was next to him and the other was diagonally opposite him. He wouldn\u2019t see him if he lowered his head but he would see his face when he raises his head consequently ruining his appetite.</p><br/><p>But he also had no reason to prevent the other person from sitting. Because of the incident earlier, Huang Shao had decided that their relationship had improved and thought it was natural for them to eat together. Huang Shao is a natural optimist. Despite always being cheery, he cared greatly about his brothers. Seeing that there in a chance in improving their relationship, he obviously wanted to give them a push.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu obviously noticed the reluctance on Jiang Yang\u2019s face but when was he someone who is considerate? Jiang Yang was not happy and, seeing this, it only made him happy. Without a thought, he walked towards the table with large strides and bluntly sat down next to Jiang Yang. He smiled and said: \u201cWhat a coincidence desk partner.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang coldly snorted in response.</p><br/><p>As for Xie Zhe, he naturally sat in the seat diagonally opposite to Jiang Yang and was coincidentally opposite Xiao Yuxin. Putting down his plate, he smiled while squinting his pair of peach eyes while warmly sending him a greeting, \u201cLittle class leader~\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin responded vaguely before continuing to stuff his food down. His posture made him look like he was trying to bury his head into the plate and didn\u2019t have any desire to make eye contact with Xie Zhe.</p><br/><p>Since the last incident where he was dragged into Xie Zhe\u2019s arms, Xie Zhe couldn\u2019t help like he had just discovered something very interesting. When he had nothing to do, he would love to tease him and render him nervous to the point of not knowing what to do. This also resulted in Xiao Yuxin desperately trying to hide from him whenever he sees him, like a mouse hiding from a cat. Unfortunately this only made him even more enthusiastic. He no longer flirted with girls and, instead, he spend most of the day playing around with Xiao Yuxin. This move of Xie Zhe\u2019s didn\u2019t raise anyone\u2019s suspicions and onlookers even joined in a few times dissolving the barrier between the class leader and the other classmates.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Despite being embarrassed, Xiao Yuxin was also grateful to Xie Zhe. He comforted himself internally; Xie Zhe is only displaying interest in him on a whim. After a while, he wouldn\u2019t be like this. Although he thought this, he would still panic whenever he sees him. Therefore, even his act of eating slowed down, as if his appetite was gone.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao saw this and asked: \u201cXiao Xin, what\u2019s wrong? There\u2019s still a lot of meat left.\u201d</p><br/><p>He bit onto his chopsticks and stared keenly at the chicken wings in Xiao Yuxin\u2019s plate.</p><br/><p>Saying this, everyone\u2019s gaze naturally moved to him. Xiao Yuxin felt a little embarrassed and said awkwardly: \u201cThe weather is too hot. I don\u2019t have the appetite.\u201d</p><br/><p>His excuse was justified. In September, the sun is very strong and only the third year classrooms had air conditioning. After staying in a sultry classroom and getting baked by the heat, it was natural for their appetite to be affected.</p><br/><p>But not everyone was like this. There will always be people who are unaffected.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao is a classic example of this. He bit onto his chopsticks and sighed, \u201cNo appetite. When will I be like you? I always have an appetite but I want to lose weight, slim down and even get a wide shoulder and long legs~\u201d</p><br/><p>He unhappily shoved a spoonful of rice into his mouth and grabbed the chicken wing in Xiao Yuxin\u2019s plate. Eating with gusto he commented: \u201cDon\u2019t waste it. I\u2019ll help you eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin &amp; the others: \u201c\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe shook his head. With a smile on his lips, he suddenly passed a few pork ribs from his plate over to Xiao Yuxin\u2019s and said: \u201cEven if you don\u2019t have the appetite, you should eat. Otherwise you won\u2019t have the energy for the afternoon classes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Suddenly seeing him acting all serious and unlike his usual playful manner, and even displaying concern for him, Xiao Yuxin was surprised. He didn\u2019t know how to react and only stare at him dumbfoundedly with his dark eyes round like saucers.</p><br/><p>That appearance of his was pretty cute.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe thought this and couldn\u2019t help but reach out and rub his head, \u201cEat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin returned to his senses and was flustered. He looked down at the aromatic sauce coated pork ribs and inexplicably found it quite appetising. He hurriedly picked up a piece and placed it in his mouth.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao watched this and couldn\u2019t help but comment: \u201cXie Zhe, why do I feel that you look like you are feeding a pet?</p><br/><p>He was only saying this casually but Xiao Yuxin who heard this choked on his food and turned to the side while coughing.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe advised him to be more careful before turning back to Huang Shao: \u201cIt\u2019s just as you have said. Earlier you stole food from my pet and even ate it quite happily?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xiao Yuxin coughed even harder. His face reddened and internally he complained: Although it was nice that Xie Zhe is speaking up for him, he\u2019s not helping the situation at all!</p><br/><p>While the situation over there is filled with laughter and as warm as spring, Jiang Yang\u2019s side was in a completely different state.</p><br/><p>With miles of ice and snow, it was like the area around them had frozen solid.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and Qin Xu quietly and expressionlessly ate their own lunch from their plates. Despite sitting so close, they didn\u2019t talk. No matter how you look at it, it was very strange.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Huang Shao wanted to help but every time he tried to start a conversation, he only received a cold response. In the end he could only turn his head and join the other two. He thought; the problems between these two will probably have to be dealt with by themselves. If things went wrong, he might end up in the crossfire and he was afraid that he would not be able to withstand it.</p><br/><p>But in fact, only the two parties themselves knew what they were thinking.</p><br/><p>Halfway through the meal, a tall figure passed their table. Qin Xu sat on the outermost side of the table and was the first to be noticed.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong saw him and with her mouth curling up slightly, a soft, beautiful smile formed on her face. Her voice was low, like the sound of a guitar strummed, and said: \u201cQin Xu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu heard this and looked up. For a moment he was surprised but he soon smiled and responded, \u201cYou\u2019re done?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tong raised the plate in her hands and nodded.</p><br/><p>The two chatted happily and looked like lovely couple. Jiang Yang frowned slightly and suddenly placed down his chopsticks. He lightly stated: \u201cI\u2019m done.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the conversation suddenly interrupted, Wu Tong was slightly surprised but she soon recovered back her gorgeous smile, \u201cThen let\u2019s go together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang nodded. When he looked at her, his mood recovered slightly. He stood up and they walked to the side of the cafeteria side by side.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao watched on silently. He thought that Qin Xu would also follow them but only found him remaining in his seat with no inclination to move while quietly watching the two figures leaving. Huang Shao felt very disappointed. He found it very interesting watching the two compete with each other over Wu Tong and it was better than when they treated each other coldly. He really didn\u2019t understand whether they had a good relationship or a bad relationship.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao was not the only one disappointed. Wu Tong also secretly sighed. Wondering why she hadn\u2019t heard Qin Xu\u2019s voice, she took the opportunity when they turned a corner to look back in his direction only to see him looking in their direction \u2013 straight at the side profile of Jiang Yang.</p><br/><p>Wu Tong\u2019s corners of her lips gradually raised, and soon, it had spread across her face reaching her eyes. Her smile this time was brighter and more radiant than ever.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was thinking about some things and when he looked over, he saw that she was smiling very happily. Curious, he asked: \u201cDid you remember something that made you happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tong looked over at him and nodded: \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong>At the table Huang Shao, the only steel straight man, shivered as cold dog food slapped his face\u2026.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

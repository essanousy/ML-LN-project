It was an obvious reaction since everyone would be able to out for a day to play. On the spring trip, they didn\u2019t need have any classes and even had the opportunity to play so how can they not be excited? Even if they had to take the mid-semester exam before that, everyone didn\u2019t think much of it and just anticipated eagerly for the trip.</p><br/><p>They were also in their second year of high school, so this would be the last time their class would go out on a trip. Once they entered their third year, they no longer would have the time to play. Thinking this, all the students chose to attend and not one of them were absent.</p><br/><p>Perhaps because the trip was right after their exams, it felt like a reward for them and the students studied for their exams with even more motivation. However, they would also occasionally be distracted as they thought about what snacks they should bring on the trip and prearrange who they would sit next to on the way there and back.</p><br/><p>Soon, the midsemester exams ended and it was the day before the spring trip. During the evening self-study session, everyone was very jittery.</p><br/><p>The class teacher notified the students of the time of departure tomorrow and things that they should be on the look out for. Seeing the students chattering, he shook his head and suddenly thought of something with a smile, \u201cSince you don\u2019t have any homework, you\u2019re all free tonight. Why don\u2019t we go to the shops to buy the things that you will need for tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>The whole class was stunned for a moment before they raised their hands and cheering. Their teacher is the best!</p><br/><p>The things that they would need tomorrow naturally referred to snacks. Today was already Thursday and, by now, all the snacks that they had brought on Monday had already been demolished so they didn\u2019t have enough for the trip.</p><br/><p>The teacher stood on the podium and clapped his hands: \u201cOkay, everyone be quiet and get ready. We will leave in five minutes. Don\u2019t talk when we go downstairs, or you will disturb the other students.\u201d</p><br/><p>The student\u2019s eyes shone brightly with excitement. Their raised their hand and said: \u201cTeacher can I go back to the dormitory to get something?\u201d</p><br/><p>The class teacher understood them very well, \u201cWhat are you going to get? With the exams over, you guys definitely brought your phones to class to play so you don\u2019t need to go back to get money.\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone snickered tacitly. As they headed downstairs, despite the prior warning not to speak, they couldn\u2019t help but whisper to each other, \u201cHey, with the other students still in class, I suddenly feel that we\u2019re so fortunate.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah heehee.\u201d The student next to them nodded their head in agreement.</p><br/><p>There was a supermarket not far from the school. Although it was smaller than then the major shopping malls, it still consisted of three storeys, so it was enough for the students to shop around.</p><br/><p>Going shopping wasn\u2019t something new for them but it was different for them to be able to go shopping as a whole class so there was an unspeakable amount of happiness amongst them.</p><br/><p>The class teacher notified them of the time that they should get back together at the entrance and the students slowly started scattering around. Despite this, he would occasionally spot a familiar blue and white uniform moving around here and there.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and the others stayed together and pushed a trolley that they used to hold the snacks that they picked up.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao was is very talkative. He could easily spill out words from his mouth nonstop and he would occasionally run off to grab something that he liked to eat or eat some food samples. He returned with a dumpling food sample and handed a piece over to each of them. He blew onto it and took a bite before grinning, \u201cKimchi flavoured. It\u2019s surprisingly pretty good. Should we buy a bag?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201cWhat are you going to use to cook it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cFrying pan?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going to get the pan from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao scratched his head and chuckled.</p><br/><p>It was clearly the time when they should be self-studying in class and, now that they were outside shopping for snacks, he became overly excited. As soon as Huang Shao saw something that he liked to eat, he would run off again.</p><br/><p>Several people left, and this left Jiang Yang and Qin Xu pushing the shopping cart while moving forward slowly. When travelling, Jiang Yang preferred to pack light and he didn\u2019t usually bring many snacks, so he didn\u2019t have much to buy.</p><br/><p>They walked through an aisle with fridges that had various drinks displayed. Qin Xu spotted something familiar and bent down to pick it up. He turned around and smiled at Jiang Yang: \u201cYour favourite yogurt. They\u2019re selling this pack for 28. Do you want it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang heard the word yogurt and turned around with his eyes bright. He then quickly restored his expression and deliberately acted calm as he picked up two packs, \u201cIs that so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu suppressed his laughter: \u201cWe don\u2019t have fridges, so it would have to be eaten soon. Can you finish it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang glared over at him and answered seriously, \u201cThere\u2019s only six cartons. How can I not finish it? It\u2019s more likely that it won\u2019t be enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without even thinking he knew that the others would definitely take it when they returned. It would be considered a good outcome if he managed to have two of them.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was in a good mood, \u201cDid you also include my share?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang shook his head coldly, \u201cNo. It\u2019s all for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eating all those cold things, aren\u2019t you afraid of getting a stomachache?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShare me one carton.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot giving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu held onto Jiang Yang and buried his face into the crook of is neck in a very clingy manner that others seeing it couldn\u2019t help but look away. Jiang Yang had grown used to this and didn\u2019t find it uncomfortable. The other classmates had also seen this often and just thought that their relationship had improved a lot.</p><br/><p>When it was time for the students to return, the students gathered up at the entrance of the shops and chattered rowdily on their way back.</p><br/><p>The next day, everyone went to the classroom and the class leader found out about the car license number for the bus before guiding the students down to find it. Before they boarded the bus the teacher in charge yelled: \u201cClass leaders should count the number of people and make sure you don\u2019t miss anyone. Everyone, line up to board to bus. If you have any problems, make sure you come and find me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Based on the class numbers, the boys allowed the girls to board the bus first. There were even some who enthusiastically stood next to the bus door and raised their hand like a train conductor directing the girls to board the bus one by one.</p><br/><p>The excitement on this side was witnessed by the liberal arts class from not far away. They couldn\u2019t help but whisper in envy: \u201cThe girls in the science classes are so lucky.\u201d</p><br/><p>The liberal arts boys weren\u2019t willing to admit defeat, \u201cWe can also do that.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl nodded, that\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>And then with her little friends they linked hands and formed an arch and allowed several boys to enjoy this treatment as they boarded the bus.</p><br/><p>Boy: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Over at class five, the girls have all boarded and now the boys were boarding one by one.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang got on and, before he could have a good look at which seats are vacant, he saw Qin Xu sitting at the very back smiling brightly and waving his hand at him. The seat next to him just happened to be empty and it was clear that it was left for him.</p><br/><p>After a moment of hesitation, Jiang Yang didn\u2019t say anything and proceeded to walk over naturally and sit down next to him.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled as he looked over at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t say anything, but his expression unconsciously softened a little.</p><br/><p>After all the students boarded, the bus driver started the car and directed it out the school gates. The students plastered themselves up against the windows and looked out in anticipation for this school trip.</p><br/><p>However, this excitement wasn\u2019t maintained very long. Because the ride would take more than an hour, they needed to find something to keep them entertained. Things like playing games of listening to music are some good options. There were even students who had already pulled out their snacks to eat.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want some?\u201d</p><br/><p>With this question a box of biscuits and a bag of chips were passed around from the front to the back in a circle. If there were some left it would be returned back to the owner and others would be gone by the time it was halfway around.</p><br/><p>Half an hour later, they couldn\u2019t help but feel bored.</p><br/><p>Someone shouted and suggested: \u201cWhy don\u2019t we sing?\u201d</p><br/><p>This obviously should be consulted with the teacher. The class leader asked, and the class teacher seemingly didn\u2019t even need to think before nodding his head in agreement. He just said that they should make sure they support themselves well when they\u2019re standing.</p><br/><p>The bus driver heard this and looked back through the rearview mirror. He said enthusiastically: \u201cI have a microphone here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just right.</p><br/><p>The classmates who were good at singing were pushed to the front of the bus. They stood in the aisle with their back against the railing. One hand held onto the back of the chair for support and the other held the microphone. Their signing voice spread through the bus and several students even started singing along. The atmosphere very quickly started to heat up and it was filled with vigour.</p><br/><p>After a few songs, there as a period where no one was going up to sing. Huang Shao started to shout: \u201cXiao Yang Yang go!\u201d</p><br/><p>He even happily picked out a difficult love song for him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026..\u201d If you want me to die just say so. You don\u2019t need to do it in such a roundabout way.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu naturally could tell what he was thinking. He couldn\u2019t help but burst out laughing. Jiang Yang, with his deliberate look of calmness, heard the laughter coming from beside him and elbowed him without a thought.</p><br/><p>After groaning softly in pain, Qin Xu smiled again and said: \u201cI\u2019ll sing instead for Xiao Yang Yang.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, he really stood up. With a hint of a smile in his eyes, he patted Jiang Yang\u2019s thighs to indicate for him to make way. Qin Xu sat on the seat next to the window and, as he left his seat, he would naturally get very close to Jiang Yang. Their thighs touched, and the body heat travelled through the thin school uniform fabric. It attacked him so suddenly that he couldn\u2019t ignore it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang for some reason shrank backwards like he was trying to escape. He was afraid of getting too close to that scorching hot body.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s popularity in the class was naturally quite high. He is tall and slender, and even had a good figure. He walked along the aisle to the front of the bus and all the classmates uniformly started to applaud loudly. They only stopped when he picked up the microphone.</p><br/><p>Starting from the first word, the curve at the corner of Qin Xu\u2019s mouth didn\u2019t fall and he continued to sing with a faint hint of a smile on his face. His expression was warm and gentle to the point that it wasn\u2019t difficult for the listeners to be cheesed to death.</p><br/><p>The young man\u2019s low and husky voice had a touch of youthfulness within as well as a hint of sexiness. It was complicated and subtle, but it definitely was pleasing to the ears. Several unconsciously closed their eyes and swayed their heads along with the music.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang sat at the back row and watched him from there. Although there clearly was a bit of distance between him and Qin Xu, when he looked at Qin Xu\u2019s eyes he didn\u2019t feel the distance at all. It was as if he was standing right in front of him looking at him with his eyes bright and dazzling like stars on a night sky. It made him\u2026\u2026at loss.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know if it was just his imagination, but Jiang Yang felt his heart pounding furiously in his chest. He glanced over before quickly looking back down to look away from Qin Xu\u2019s gaze and pretended to naturally pick up a chocolate stick to eat. He shoved it into his mouth and lazily chewed onto it. But as he ate the biscuit, he unconsciously recalled some events that happened in the past with Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>\u201cI really really, really really, really really want to be together with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe person who loves you the most is me but how can you bear to make me sad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLike this, I am conquered by you and you have cut off all my means of escape.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want to use this lifetime to love you. From now on, you will be filled with happiness. Forever love, forever love, forever love.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last \u2018love\u2019 was dragged, and it lingered in the air for a while. There was a hard to describe feeling hidden within and the class teacher couldn\u2019t help but look back a few times to see if this song was sung by Qin Xu for a special someone.</p><br/><p>Young love, this was an issue that the class teacher dared not to take too lightly. It wasn\u2019t something that was to be feared of, but the children are still young, and the class teacher was worried that they couldn\u2019t manage it well and end up having it affect their studies.</p><br/><p>But the class teacher was destined to be unable to find her. This was because that someone wasn\u2019t a \u2018her\u2019 but a \u2018him\u2019.</p><br/><p>That \u2018him\u2019 was even awkwardly looking down pretending to concentrate on eating his snacks and acted unconcerned about Qin Xu\u2019s singing. He would look up occasionally while pretending to be indifferent.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu finished singing and walked back with a smile on his face. He got closer and closer to Jiang Yang until he stopped right in front to him. With one hand on the back of the seat in front of him he leaned down and used his dark eyes to stare fixatedly at Jiang Yang. He didn\u2019t say anything but there were lots of words concealed in his gaze.</p><br/><p>Because they were too close, Qin Xu\u2019s shadow covered over Jiang Yang. Unable to escape from it, his breathing became shallow and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little pressured. Jiang Yang moved his line sight away and shrank back while pretending to act impatient: \u201cHurry up and get in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s lips curved as he continued to look at Jiang Yang but Jiang Yang had bowed his head, so he could only see the top of his head and his hair whorl, \u201cOkay. I\u2019ll go in now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was clearly normal dialogue but why did it sound a little dirty?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

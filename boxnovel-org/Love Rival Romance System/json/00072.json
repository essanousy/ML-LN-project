At this moment, everyone was in a good mood. After all, they didn\u2019t need to do their homework and could go back and play on their phones.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang however was an outlier. He wasn\u2019t happy and was instead a bit ashamed. Earlier in class, he didn\u2019t know what came over him, but he actually bit Qin Xu. Qin Xu at that time only stared at him wordlessly but that only made things scarier. Jiang Yang preferred it if Qin Xu would retaliate right then and there instead.</p><br/><p>They returned to the dormitory and took turns to wash up. When Jiang Yang wanted to return to his bed, he walked past Qin Xu and found his wrist suddenly grabbed onto. Qin Xu looked at him with a grin: \u201cLet\u2019s play a few games.\u201d</p><br/><p>And then he pulled the other person over to sit onto his bed. What he had meant by playing games wasn\u2019t where the two played games together. Instead, it was just Jiang Yang playing and Qin Xu watching from the side.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang held the phone in his hand and Qin Xu sat behind him with his arms around his waist and chin on his shoulder. He was like a very spoiled large dog, but he was also very restless.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt awkward. He struggled a few times in his arms and asked him to let go as it was distracting him.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201cHow can that be? Aren\u2019t you playing pretty well now? Also, you bit me earlier and I still haven\u2019t settled that account with you yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he said this, Jiang Yang felt a little guilty. Truthfully, he regretted doing it but if he was to be put in the same situation again, he would probably still do it. Who let this guy hold onto him like that? And it was even in the classroom!</p><br/><p>But really, don\u2019t they get touchy and feely quite often in class? It was just that before, he had not unveiled the truth, so Jiang Yang could convince himself that it was normal for boys to interact with each other like that. Now that he had a realisation, he couldn\u2019t help but feel guilty about what he had been doing in class all this time.</p><br/><p>Although it was obvious, there was someone who is mentally very tough. To put it very bluntly, his is just thick skinned. With him acting so natural and straightforwardly, it conversely made things appear normal.</p><br/><p>Like right now, Qin Xu held him in his arms. Just below his eyes was the side profile of the person that he likes, handsome and beautiful. No matter how long he looked at it, he didn\u2019t get bored. Also, that pale and round earlobe of his had a pinkish tinge to it making it appear particularly small and cute. For a moment he couldn\u2019t hold himself back and he proceeded to open his mouth and suck onto it.</p><br/><p>The sudden sensation shocked Jiang Yang\u2019s entire being. His fingertips went soft and he almost threw the phone onto the ground!</p><br/><p>Like he was shocked by electricity, Jiang Yang violently exploded in Qin Xu\u2019s arms. He used one hand to cover his bright red ear and on his face was a mixture of anger and shame, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..You!!!\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to curse him out, but he also couldn\u2019t say it!</p><br/><p>The culprit Qin Xu was being glared at, but he didn\u2019t look guilty at all. Instead, he curved his lips into a smile and licked his lips with a seemingly satisfied expression.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026.Fuck, that pervert!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s mind went blank. After his anger dissipated, he looked at his roguish expression and felt his scalp go numb.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang quickly looked around the room. When he saw that the other roommates were busy playing on their phones and didn\u2019t pay attention to them, he was able to breath a sigh of relief. He lowered his voice and gave a word of warning, \u201cDon\u2019t take this too far!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was warning him not to be too arrogant and to remember that they\u2019re at school.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu understood what he was saying but when he looked over at him, he couldn\u2019t help but put on an aggrieved and wrong expression, \u201cI have already restrained myself a lot\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before, he liked him, but was afraid of making it too obvious and scaring the other person away. But now, their relationship had been confirmed and he was just too happy.</p><br/><p>When he\u2019s together with the person that he likes, he wanted to announce it to the whole world. How could he hold back and just keep it inside? Rather than doing so to show off his love, he wanted to do it mainly due to his possessive desire. He wanted to say arrogantly; this person is mine, don\u2019t even think about it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at that expression of his and decided that it was a waste of effort to say anything else. He could only pretend to be calm while taking a step back to avoid his passionate gaze, \u201cIt\u2019s about time to go sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmmmm.\u201d Qin Xu obediently nodded. Of course, he knew it was time for bed. He then said with a grin, \u201cThen can you sleep with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>That soft and husky voice carried a hint of sexiness and temptation.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was almost seduced into nodding his head and agreeing. He then quickly returned to his senses and shook his head. What is he doing?! Of course, he can\u2019t!</p><br/><p>He then quickly threw out a sentence of \u2018I\u2019m going back\u2019 before quickly climbing up the ladder and getting into his bed. By the time he was able to sit down properly, his heart was still beat very quickly. He looked down at his phone and saw that his character had long been killed off by the enemy. It was all Qin Xu that bastard\u2019s fault.</p><br/><p>After the lights turned off.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang as always played on his phone but this time he wasn\u2019t completely immersed. Sometimes he couldn\u2019t help but look over at Qin Xu\u2019s side. Although he couldn\u2019t see the other person in the dark and could only see his faint figure, he still wanted to take a look as it helped with putting him in a good mood.</p><br/><p>His phone vibrated, and notifications constantly appeared on the screen with Qin Xu\u2019s name written at the top.</p><br/><p>He selected it open and took a look.</p><br/><p>\u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWant to hug.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLonely, can\u2019t sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I do, I like you too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang muttered to himself in a small voice. \u201cEven double texting, he\u2019s too old to be acting cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then snorted.</p><br/><p>And then he sent out two words \u201cGet lost.\u201d <em>(</em><em>KKnotes:</em><em></em><em>: Gun Gun \u2013 Also a name of a panda)</em></p><br/><p>Qin Xu then actually sent him a picture of Gun Gun. With black and white fluffy hair, it looked like a rice dumpling. It really was a super cute national treasure.</p><br/><p>\u201cI was clearly talking to you so why are you suddenly asking for Gun Gun? Tell me, do you like him more than me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t suppress his laugh. He typed a word, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu immediately responded with wails and sent over a pitiful crying emoticon. He said: \u201cSo upset, so sad. I must hold Jiang Yang to sleep so that I will feel better.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang very \u2018coldly and ruthlessly\u2019 refused, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, Jiang Yang gently pulled up the blankets around him and waited for Qin Xu to reply. But after waiting for half a minute, he didn\u2019t get a response and the chat window didn\u2019t indicate that the other party was typing something. This made Jiang Yang wonder if he had accidentally hurt Qin Xu\u2019s fragile little heart after ruthlessly turning him down. He supported himself up and wanted to look out over the railing to Qin Xu\u2019s side but, before he could stick his head out, a figure suddenly appeared at the top of his stairs, surprising him.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu came uninvited and smiled very happily while saying stubbornly: \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m still coming.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then arrogantly climbed onto Jiang Yang\u2019s bed and very agilely burrowed himself into his blankets giving him no opportunity to refuse. Jiang Yang however originally didn\u2019t have any intention to kick him out. He had only said no earlier to tease him.</p><br/><p>And so, when Qin Xu rolled over, hugged onto Jiang Yang and nuzzled against his neck, he only snorted lightly and didn\u2019t push him away. Like this, the two leaned against each other intimately, closed their eyes and slept. Their hearts were sweet like they had just eaten a large pot of honey but what they didn\u2019t expect was that they would have a very strange dream.</p><br/><p>While they slept, the two systems quietly communicated.</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, I failed my first assignment, didn\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBased on the original goal of turning them into friends, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWuwu, why is it like this? I clearly followed the manual.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHuman emotions are very complicated. There will always be unexpected accidents.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen how many systems have encountered something like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026..As far as I know, none.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWaaahhhhh!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. The superiors still think that you did pretty well, so you can just transfer to another department. For you, it might actually be more suitable.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been fired?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, and the other department is more difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen will the salary be higher?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d That was a fast change.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSenior, when do we leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSoon. There\u2019s still one more task for them to understand each other better. Humans have always regretted that they hadn\u2019t met the person that they liked earlier and would always want to be part of their life in the past. Of course, this kind of thing is impossible, but we can help out a little as a system.\u201d</p><br/><p>In his dream, Qin Xu arrived at a point in Jiang Yang\u2019s childhood. But of course, he didn\u2019t notice anything wrong with it at the beginning. He didn\u2019t even realise that he was in a dream since everything looked so realistic.</p><br/><p>When he saw a small street stand selling a very nostalgic snack that he often ate as a child, he impulsively walked over wanting to buy some to eat. He grabbed two bags and walked over to the boss with his phone in his hand and asked naturally: \u201cBoss, where\u2019s the QR code?\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss was confused: \u201cWhat\u2019s QR code?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was even more confused. He answered as a matter of factly: \u201cThe WeChat QR code. Otherwise how will I pay you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Boss: \u201cYoung man, what are you talking about? You obviously pay me with money. Those bags are two bucks. If you don\u2019t have money, you can\u2019t buy it. We don\u2019t accept anything else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu furrowed his brows, \u201cBoss, you don\u2019t use WeChat? There aren\u2019t many people carrying cash around with them these days. You\u2019re losing business like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss was impatient: \u201cAre you deliberately messing with me? If you\u2019re not buying anything, leave. Don\u2019t bother me running my business.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu felt very wronged. Although he would always bring around some money with him in case of an emergency, he had already grown accustomed to using his phone to pay as it was more convenient. At this moment, his eyes inadvertently moved to the wall on the side and saw the calendar hanging on it. The date however was very strange, \u201cBoss, why are you still using a calendar from ten years ago\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wait.</p><br/><p>The moment those words left his mouth, the feeling that something wasn\u2019t right got stronger and stronger. When he heard the boss mutter irately that things like; he must be crazy, what does he mean ten years ago, its clearly this year\u2019s calendar and that he should go see a doctor, Qin Xu slowly made a bold guess.</p><br/><p>He looked down at his own hand and then ran over to a glass window. He saw that he was still his usual appearance and had not changed. The only thing that had changed was where he was. When he ran out and walked down the street, he became even more certain. He usually read novels and, in a situation like this, he immediately realised \u2014 He had travelled ten years to the past!</p><br/><p>But isn\u2019t this violating the rules of time and space? At this moment, there probably is two of him existing, unless he is in a parallel world? Also, he\u2019s very satisfied with his current life okay? He didn\u2019t want to be reborn so why is he sudden thrown into the past? He had only just gotten together with the person he likes!!! Wait\u2026..What happened after I confirmed my relationship with Xiao Yang Yang? Did I die?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu supported his chin and frowned in thought while he slowly walked down the street. The more he thought about it, the unhappier he got.</p><br/><p>This was until he suddenly felt something hit his leg. He subconsciously looked down and saw a small, round face looking up at him. Because he had just bumped his nose, his eyes were a little red, like he would start crying the next second.</p><br/><p>\u201cI can\u2019t cry.\u201d The little boy innocently reminded himself with a clenched fist that he should be a strong man. It had to be said, he looked quite cute like that.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu couldn\u2019t restrain himself and accidentally laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>When the little boy heard it, he looked over at him with a dissatisfied glare. It was unfortunate that he was small and cute, like a beautiful porcelain doll, so he didn\u2019t appear threatening at all. His angry look only made people think, wow so cute.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Qin Xu wasn\u2019t affected by it, the little boy was even more angry, but he was in the wrong for running into the other person, so he could only pout and reluctantly give his apologies before turning around and walking away.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu also originally didn\u2019t want to spare him any more attention but at this moment two other children ran over while shouting: \u201cJiang Yang, are you okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu suddenly froze. He then quickly reached out and grabbed the collar of the child in front of him. That action was like he was holding onto a kitten by the scruff of its neck. All that was missing was him lifting the child up.</p><br/><p>The little boy\u2019s eyes widened with shock. He looked back at the big bad man behind him and his little face was filled with complaints. It was like he was saying \u2014- \u201cLet go of me!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

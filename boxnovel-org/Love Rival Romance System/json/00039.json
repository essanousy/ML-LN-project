Most students would just buy their breakfast and then take off. There were also students who would rather use that time to sleep a little more instead and head straight to the classroom when class starts. To fill their stomach, they would go to the school store in between class to buy bread.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and Qin Xu sat opposite each other as they ate their rice noodles. Jiang Yang very excitedly pulled out his phone to take photos and even from time to time asked him to make certain poses.</p><br/><p>\u201cBlink and act cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAct like a cat.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCup your face with your hands and smile.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cPick your nose and make a silly face.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Qin Xu did everything Jiang Yang asked him to do and very soon, he had taken a bunch of cute and ugly photos. Jiang Yang happily placed his phone back into his pocket. Imaging how funny it would be when he shows it to Qin Xu after he recovers, he patted Qin Xu\u2019s head affectionately: \u201cGood boy~\u201d</p><br/><p>The innocent Qin Xu smiled happily.</p><br/><p>After finishing their breakfast, they headed to the teaching building. Qin Xu once again cautiously tried to hold Jiang Yang\u2019s hand but because he was afraid that Jiang Yang would get angry, he could only carefully touch it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was in a good mood so the moment he felt his fingers being touched, he thought Qin Xu wanted something. He turned around and asked: \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu saw that he wasn\u2019t angry and was satisfied. He thought that Jiang Yang wouldn\u2019t be disgusted if he held his hand and proceeded to bravely grab on. It just happened that at this moment another student turned the corner around the stairs above them and Jiang Yang moved to the side to make way for them. This resulted in Qin Xu missing his hand and grabbing onto thin air.</p><br/><p>The student who came downstairs happened to be Xie Zhe who wanted to go to the school store. Seeing that it was an acquaintance, he smiled and greeted them: \u201cXu brother, Jiang Yang, morning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMorning.\u201d Jiang Yang replied faintly.</p><br/><p>As for Qin Xu, because he had interrupted his earlier endeavour to hold Jiang Yang\u2019s hands, he only looked on at him with a cold and unhappy expression. For a moment, he no longer had that childish smile on his face and his temperament had completely changed into one that was similar to his persona prior to his memory loss; as if he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to beat someone up if they angered him. Being glared at like that, Xie Zhe reflexively assumed that Qin Xu was still in a bad mood from getting up early in the morning and quickly slipped away, \u201cI\u2019ll head off first. Bye bye.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the culprit gone, Qin Xu reverted back to his earlier pitiful appearance. He shuffled up to Jiang Yang\u2019s side and grabbed onto his hand. In a soft and spoiled voice, he called out his name. \u201cJiang Yang\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the usual arrogant voice soften into one like those of a child\u2019s\u2019, Jiang Yang felt his head hurt. For a moment he forgot to throw his hands off and said exasperatingly: \u201cWhat do you want now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was satisfied that he managed to hold onto his hand and he said with a small smile, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but wonder why there was so much change in his personality.</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Jiang Yang was also too lazy to pay him any attention and continued to walk towards the classroom. When he entered the classroom, he finally realised that they were still holding hands. He frowned and quickly let go before walking over to his desk. For once, he didn\u2019t get angry. It was probably because he realised that it was useless getting angry and that he should wait until he recovers to settle the account.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was thrown off and he felt a little wronged. But because they had already reached the classroom, he didn\u2019t feel too upset. He shuffled over, sat down next to Jiang Yang and pulled out a few snacks to eat.</p><br/><p>On this day, Jiang Yang had already prepared Qin Xu and himself well to prevent his amnesia from being exposed. He had already advised Qin Xu to pay attention in class, not to talk or play little tricks, be a good student and not to call him father or cry.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, his words were very effective. Qin Xu didn\u2019t bother him during class and just pulled out his phone to play games. Jiang Yang watched him through the corner of his eyes but luckily the teacher only came over to tell him to put his phone back. Basically, everything went smoothly.</p><br/><p>The morning passed smoothly and there were only a few hours left in the afternoon. Very soon, Qin Xu would be back to normal. Jiang Yang could finally see the light in front of him now that everything was coming to an end. During this time, he had managed to train his patience. In fact, apart from his clinginess, the currently Qin Xu is not too bad and actually quite obedient. When Jiang Yang thought this, he didn\u2019t realise that his temperament had improved significantly after dealing with Qin Xu version 502.</p><br/><p>Afternoon physical education class.</p><br/><p>The boys naturally played basketball. Hearing that it was group activities, Jiang Yang immediately frowned and was worried. He deliberately slowed down his pace as they headed to the gymnasium to join Qin Xu at the back and Qin Xu deliberately quickened his steps to meet him. Unexpectedly, there was an understanding between the two.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang asked: \u201cYou haven\u2019t forgotten how to play basketball right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu replied with confidence: \u201cI play very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d That narcissistic side of him has not changed.</p><br/><p>On the court, Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but check Qin Xu\u2019s situation. Seeing that there wasn\u2019t anything strange going on, he smoothly took two steps forward and dunked into the hoop. That action of his was very fluid and handsome, and several girls who watched on couldn\u2019t help but chatter amongst themselves in amazement.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang released a breath and inexplicably felt a little sad. It was probably the same feeling as the father realising that his child had grown up and no longer needed him.</p><br/><p>The next second, because of these strange emotions of his, Jiang Yang felt goose bumps appear on his arms and he couldn\u2019t help but shiver. After playing a game, Jiang Yang waved his hand and said that he wanted to take a break and moved to sit down on the metal seats on the side.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he\u2019s no longer playing, Qin Xu also threw down the ball and moved to sit down next to him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang sat casually in his seat with his legs spread apart and one of it rested on the step below. He had on hand resting lazily on his knees and the other supported his chin as he watched the other hot-blooded youths running around the court.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu walked over and sat down but he didn\u2019t watch the classmates on the court and, instead, he watched Jiang Yang next to him.</p><br/><p>The summer wind blew softly over them but, although it wasn\u2019t very cool, it is still better than nothing. They just happened to sit in the shadow casted by the building behind them and it was a good resting spot away from the sun.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang saw him come over and asked: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you playing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled radiantly while revealing his canines: \u201cDon\u2019t want to anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those sparkling eyes of his looked as if there were stars hidden within. It temporarily made Jiang Yang at loss for words. He had a feeling that Qin Xu only said half of his reason the other half being \u2014 Because you\u2019re not there. Jiang Yang laughed and shook his head. It looks like after being clung onto so much, he had also started getting crazy thoughts.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang continued to knock onto his knees as he watched the others play.</p><br/><p>After a while, when Jiang Yang was distracted, he suddenly heard a small cry of \u2018be careful\u2019. He looked over only to see a black shadow rush over and hit Qin Xu directly on his head. With a dull sound, the basketball fell to the ground and rolled to one side.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu gritted his teeth and held onto his head. His eyes were red, and tears looked like there were ready to flow out.</p><br/><p>With a ball flying over at such a fast speed, it would naturally be very painful. Qin Xu is also someone who is afraid of pain.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang saw that he was crying, and his eyes suddenly turned cold while is expression became very ugly.</p><br/><p>From another court, two boys from another class ran over to collect the ball. Clearly, one of them had thrown the ball.</p><br/><p>In such a situation if they had manners they would come over to apologise. The method of apologising would also be different. Some would realise that they had injured another person and, feeling bad, they would rush over apologising profusely while asking if they\u2019re ok. Others would just think that it was not unusual for the ball to hit another person and would just casually throw out an apology before picking up the ball and walking off.</p><br/><p>They happened to be of the latter group,</p><br/><p>One ran over and casually said \u201cmy bad\u201d before heading over in the balls\u2019 direction.</p><br/><p>Another boy said: \u201cIt looks like it hit him pretty hard. That classmate still hasn\u2019t lifted his head. Is he crying?\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy shrugged indifferently, \u201cIt\u2019s just being hit by a ball. How painful can that be for a man like him?\u201d</p><br/><p>They were still a few metres away from the ball when they suddenly saw a figure agilely pass them and pick up the ball. The figure looked up at them expressionlessly with a cold look in his eyes.</p><br/><p>The corner of Jiang Yang\u2019s mouth twitched as he repeated his words. It was spoken very lightly but they couldn\u2019t help but feel that it was spoken very coldly: \u201cIt\u2019s just being hit by a ball. How painful can that be?\u201d</p><br/><p>A smile gradually grew on that cold face of his and it slowly morphed into a sneer: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give it a try?\u201d</p><br/><p>He twisted his wrist and the muscles on his arms tightened as he mercilessly threw the ball at the boy.</p><br/><p>The boy didn\u2019t expect him to do this and he wasn\u2019t able to dodge in time. The moment his head was hit by the ball, the vision before him turned black and his head felt like it was being smashed. He couldn\u2019t help but yell out in anger: \u201cAre you motherfucking crazy?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang who was yelled at just stood on the metal steps and smiled softly. There was a smile on his face but it was clear from his eyes that he was on the verge of exploding in anger. Jiang Yang asked: \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being stared at like that by Jiang Yang, the boy felt the hair on his back stand up. His companion also tugged his arm and coaxed him: \u201cIt was originally our fault. And he\u2019s also Jiang Yang\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy gritted his teeth and gave Jiang Yang a death glare. He picked up the ball and just wanted to go back.</p><br/><p>But Jiang Yang\u2019s temper isn\u2019t something to joke about. He said in a dark voice: \u201cDid I say you can go? Apologise.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy was angered to the point that his face went red. His head was also still throbbing from the pain. He roared out: \u201cDon\u2019t take it too far!\u201d</p><br/><p>The other boys from class five also witnessed this scene and stood on Jiang Yang\u2019s side. They very loyally yelled back: \u201cWhat is too far? Do you not have any manners? Not apologising after hitting someone and even yelling at them? What happened to your morals? Was it all eaten by the dogs?\u201d</p><br/><p>About twenty boys surrounded them and the two suddenly appeared very weak. As their classmates, the other students from the other court also walked over and someone spoke up to try and settle things down: \u201cIt\u2019s just a small thing. He has already apologised, and Jiang Yang has already smashed him with the ball. Like this, it should be settled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang unfortunately was not someone who could be reasoned like this. If he didn\u2019t like something then he would just let it go and take a step back but to him, when something is wrong, it\u2019s wrong. If they don\u2019t acknowledge their mistake, then he would beat them until they do. His philosophy in life is just this simple and crude.</p><br/><p>And so, he said: \u201cApologised? But why do I feel like he wants to fight? It doesn\u2019t matter. I. am. Happy. To.\u201d</p><br/><p>Each word was spoken with emphasis and enveloped with strong anger. Those who heard it felt a chill down their spine.</p><br/><p>The faces of the students in the other class turned ugly but, truthfully speaking, they were the ones who were in the wrong.</p><br/><p>At this moment, someone suddenly spoke up: \u201cThe teacher is coming.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He shook his head and was instantly met with an extremely familiar handsome face. In Qin Xu\u2019s eyes was a hint of a smile.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao\u2019s voice travelled over from in front of him: \u201cXiao Yang Yang, you\u2019re awake? Just in time, we\u2019ve arrived~\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was flustered and, like he was shocked by electricity, he quickly sat back up and increased the distance between himself and Qin Xu. The thoughts in his mind was \u2014\u2014\u2014 Huuuhh? I fell asleep? When did I fall asleep? Why am I leaning on Qin Xu\u2019s shoulder? Did I sleep to the point that I became stupid?!</p><br/><p>He wanted to act like nothing had happened and tried to maintain a calm expression, but the other person obviously didn\u2019t want to cooperate.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu deliberately moved to massage his shoulder as he said: \u201cDid you sleep well? My shoulder is all numb.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao heard this and immediately added: \u201cXu brother didn\u2019t let me wake you up earlier. When you leaned on his shoulder, he didn\u2019t move at all. I couldn\u2019t help but feel moved! What a good husband!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corners of Jiang Yang\u2019s lips twitched, and he couldn\u2019t help but feel a little guilty. He unnaturally looked over at Qin Xu, \u201c\u2026\u2026..Sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu shrugged and smiled refreshingly, \u201cWhy are you apologising? You don\u2019t need to. I thought it was pretty good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Good? What pretty good? You\u2019re happy that your shoulders are numb?</p><br/><p>Huang Shao was a little confused. Jiang Yang was even more confused.</p><br/><p>Of course, what they didn\u2019t know was that Qin Xu had deliberately moved the sleeping Jiang Yang so that he slept on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>The teacher distributed out the tickets and reminded the students of the time that they should gather up. The students picked up a map of the amusement park each and started to go around freely.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t think much and just went along with Qin Xu. It was so natural that even he didn\u2019t react to it himself.</p><br/><p>The two most popular rollercoaster rides were naturally the first thing that they wanted to try. When they entered the amusement park, the lines for it weren\u2019t short but if they hesitated now, the line would only get longer. Perhaps it was also fortunate for them that the amusement park wasn\u2019t too crowded to the point of suffocation today. For the popular rides, they only needed to line up for about half an hour and there were even some that almost didn\u2019t need to be queued up for.</p><br/><p>They went on few rides in succession and enjoyed the thrill of weightlessness. When they got off, they still felt like they were floating and their heart beat very rapidly. They also felt especially refreshed after screaming and venting out everything inside them.</p><br/><p>After they had lunch, they sat on the wooden benches in the resting area and the group of people started to discuss what they should do next. They had already gone on the rides that they wanted to, and the remaining rides were a little weak and they all seemed similar.</p><br/><p>At this moment Huang Shao suggested, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to the haunted house!\u201d</p><br/><p>The air around them suddenly went quiet.</p><br/><p>The moment Huang Shaos words were spoken, everyone very tacitly fell silent. After two seconds, perhaps because they were embarrassed, someone spoke up and agreed.</p><br/><p>The group of people really did end up heading towards the direction of the haunted house.</p><br/><p>On the way there, Huang Shao continued to chatter on: \u201cIt says here that there is a limit to the number of people entering the haunted house each time. They must be in pairs for them to have the most immersive experience. It looks like this haunted house is pretty famous. Xiao Yang Yang, since it\u2019s pairs, I think it\u2019s better if we distribute the strengths evenly. You have been grouped with Qin brother for the whole morning so pair up with me for the haunted house. I\u2019m relying on you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang rolled his eyes in disdain: \u201cWhy are you playing if you\u2019re scared?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s exciting. Form a team with me okay?\u201d Huang Shao shoved his face over in front of Jiang Yang\u2019s face and cheekily smiled while sucking up to him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had no words. He subconsciously looked over at Qin Xu only to find him also looking over at him. Jiang Yang then turned his eyes away and nodded his head as he quickly agreed with Huang Shao\u2019s request.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao cried out \u2018yay\u2019 and continued to walk next to Jiang Yang while looking at the map, \u201cThe haunted house should take about twenty minutes. What should we do after that? Speaking of which, I heard that this haunted house is the holy place for couples to break up. Because it is dark, the scary atmosphere is generated very well, and the staff there also work very hard to scare people so many couples get scared and would run off while leaving the other behind. But that reaction is understandable. Even if their girlfriend is caught by the ghosts, they probably wouldn\u2019t have the courage to save her, so they would have no choice but to break up after coming out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao shook his head as he clicked his tongue and didn\u2019t notice Jiang Yang\u2019s stern expression that had been slowly getting worse and worse. The words that echoed in his mind were \u2014\u2014\u2013 very dark, very scary, shocking.</p><br/><p>And so, Jiang Yang decisively said: \u201cI thought about it but I think I\u2019ll form a pair with Qin Xu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao: \u201c\u2026..Huuh?!!!\u201d Why? What did I do wrong? Why are you doing this to me? Didn\u2019t we agree to be each other\u2019s guardian angels?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was cold and indifferent. He firmly refused.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao started wailing pathetically: \u201cDon\u2019t. Xiao Yang Yang please don\u2019t be so impulsive. Please seriously reconsider it one more time. I will let you grab me and hold onto me as much as you like in the haunted house. We should go through difficulties together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang maintained a look of seriousness as if he was reconsidering before saying: \u201cI considered it seriously \u2014\u2014\u2014 I still decided to pair up with Qin Xu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao\u2026\u2026\u2026throwing a tantrum on the floor in tears! Feeling wronged! Explode into a puffer fist! I\u2019m a pitiful boy that no one loves! Wuuuuuuu!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu walked next to Jiang Yang and turned his head slightly as he secretly smiled. He has happy to the point of no return.</p><br/><p>Before they even reached the entrance to the haunted house they could hear the eerie music and the occasional sharp scream, so they didn\u2019t have to worry about going to the wrong place. Black fog floated out the entrance of the haunted house and the signs indicating its location were all designed to try to scare you.</p><br/><p>The colour of the entire building was dark and dull, and eeriness emanated from all corners of the building. Strange objects were placed at the queuing area along with a signage with warnings written with a blood effect. Above their heads was a small screen playing scenes of the former tourists getting scared making those who had not gone through it yet feel nervous and fearful.</p><br/><p>The line for the haunted house was short and consistently changed. Unlike the other attractions where they eagerly looked forward to it and wished for the line to move faster, the haunted house made several of them feel hesitant and conflicted. After queuing for a few minutes, it was soon their turn. They looked at the dark entrance to the building and had the urge to flee.</p><br/><p>The group of them came here and coincidentally ran into several girls from their grade. Huang Shao saw Tang Ling Ling and his eyes brightened up. He wanted to form a pair with her but was rejected because Tang Ling Ling had already agreed beforehand to pair up with Zhang Wei.</p><br/><p>The eventual pairings were \u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang, Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe, Xiao Yuxin.</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling, Zhang Wei.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao\u2026\u2026Director Wang.</p><br/><p>That\u2019s right. It\u2019s that director Wang. Huang Shao had forcefully pulled him over with courage that came out of nowhere. In fact, it wasn\u2019t like he couldn\u2019t find someone to partner up with. Zhang Wei\u2019s ex-boyfriend Chen Ming Jie also couldn\u2019t find a partner but Huang Shao looked at him and dismissed the other party as being too timid and unreliable. He decided that he should find a strong partner and so he dragged over the expressionless and stern director Wang. With his constantly dark expression, Huang Shao was certain that the ghosts would be terrified instead.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao felt that he was just too smart.</p><br/><p>Director Wang had a look of confusion. As the teacher in charge of the spring trip, he followed the students here not to play but to ensure their safety. If an incident were to occur, he would need to respond to it immediately. This was the same for the other teachers.</p><br/><p>However, Huang Shao was too powerful. He had the ability to divert the other persons attention and make them forget their initial intentions for coming. It was like he could make the enemies intelligence fall to one that is on par with his and then strike while the iron is hot to defeat him.</p><br/><p>Before he realised what was happening, director Wang was dragged into the haunted house. The staff at the entrance even revealed a soothing and gentle smile while reminding him: \u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not that scary. Even if it is scary, please make sure you don\u2019t hit the staff.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why would he hit the staff for no reason? He would only do it if he is provoked! Hearing those words, you just couldn\u2019t help but have a bad feeling okay?!</p><br/><p>The first to go in was Tang Ling Ling and Zhang Wei. Because Zhang Wei said that she was scared of these things, she decided that short pain is better than long pain. She found it torturing waiting in the line and decided to just get it over and done with first. Tang Ling Ling said that if she\u2019s scared then she doesn\u2019t need to do it, but Zhang Wei\u2019s answer was \u2014\u2014 We\u2019ve already come this far.</p><br/><p>Yes, they had already come this far. If they didn\u2019t experience the specialty of this amusement park; the haunted house, it would be a pity. Human nature is also very strange. They\u2019re clearly scared but they still wanted to give it a try. The more afraid they were, the more curious they became. It was a wonderful cycle of self-torture.</p><br/><p>The inside of the haunted house was very dark, and they could only use a flash light to guide their way. They walked in and found it quite cold. From around them cold and eerie wind blew and there was a strange rotten smell that reached their nose. They couldn\u2019t tell what it was, but they were certain that it wasn\u2019t a good smell.</p><br/><p>The light shone over, and they could see an old and rusty metal shelf with several glass jars placed on it. Inside the jars were different body organs such as eyeballs, hands and the like. On the walls were bloody red writing and a bloody hand print that slid down the wall and slowly faded before it reached the floor. It was as if they had only half way through writing something before they were cut off. The blood red writing said \u2014\u2013 Save me.</p><br/><p>The moment Zhang Wei entered, she was already in distress. She clung tightly onto Tang Ling Ling\u2019s arms and would be scared at every small sound she heard. The moment she saw the body parts in the jars she was almost scared crazy!</p><br/><p>It had only been five minutes since they\u2019ve started!</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling was helpless, \u201cIf you\u2019re like this, it\u2019s hard to walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhang Wei clung onto her tightly and they shuffled forward very slowly.</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling dragged the heavy weight hanging from her arms and walked ahead with great difficulty. When she managed to calm the other person down and she willingly took a step forward herself, a ghost suddenly appeared from around the corner. Zhang Wei was scared and immediately started crying. Her tears rolled down uncontrollably and she cried very pitifully while hiccupping every now and then\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>\u201cAh!!!! Wuuuuuuu\u2026.. I want to go back. Hick. I can\u2019t do this anymore\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d She suddenly sent a blaming look over to the staff who was dressed as a ghost standing not far from them. He was dressed in bloody clothes and even held a severed arm in his hands.</p><br/><p>Staff: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d Suddenly he felt helpless.</p><br/><p>Perhaps because this \u2018ghost\u2019 was still young and had only recently started this job, he seemingly didn\u2019t know what to do. He subconsciously walked over and awkwardly tried to comfort the guest that he had scared to tears.</p><br/><p>Zhang Wei looked up and the first thing she saw was the bloody hand. She let out a series of screams as she scrambled backwards before crouching down onto the floor covering her face while crying. She was also hiccupping very badly with her shoulders shuddering with every breath.</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d I wasn\u2019t scared to death by the ghost, but I was almost scared to death by you.</p><br/><p>She reached out and wanted to pat the ghost\u2019s shoulders but, seeing the blood on his shoulders, she silently retracted her hand. She said calmly: \u201cYou should go hide first otherwise she would be too scared to move forward.\u201d</p><br/><p>The young \u2018ghost\u2019 saw her huddling into a ball and could only aggrievedly walk away.</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling walked over and tried to help support her up only to find that it was quite difficult.</p><br/><p>Zhang Wei with a bitter expression: \u201cMy legs went soft\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d I must\u2019ve been crazy when I agreed to come here with you!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

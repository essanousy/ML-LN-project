He was worried that something may have gone wrong and would result in him failing the task. The punishment this time was too harsh and the task was just a matter of becoming his desk partner; Jiang Yang could just choose to ignore him when they\u2019re sitting together.</p><br/><p>After seeing the two names together, Jiang Yang was able to silently breathe a sigh of relief and slightly relax his taut face.</p><br/><p>As the other students looked for their own names, Huang Shao lazily returned back to the classroom and saw the commotion in the classroom through the window. He leaned onto the edge of the window and looked towards Jiang Yang: \u201cAre we still desk partners?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang shook his head.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao immediately put on a bitter face and acted miserable: \u201cHow can the teacher be so cruel and separate us? This won\u2019t do, I\u2019ll go and talk to the teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he said this, he had already turned around and ran off. Jiang Yang froze. He was afraid that he would end up running to the teacher and say something that would reveal his lies. Worried, he instantly singlehandedly supported himself with the table and jumped out the window into the corridor outside and prepared to chase after him.</p><br/><p>But only after a few steps he saw Huang Shao that bastard returning with a radiant smile.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s eyes were filled with confusion: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao clutched his chest and said shyly: \u201cOh no, I can feel my heart beating. Can you hear it? It\u2019ll be good if I\u2019m partners with Xu Chun. I just saw her smile, it was super cute~\u201d</p><br/><p>Xu Chun is the general committee member in their class. Her personality is soft and introverted, and she doesn\u2019t smile much.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao often had his heart in his sleeves and like a mantra, he would fall in love several times a day. Hearing this, Jiang Yang could only roll his eyes and karate chop the top of his head, \u201cWake up. Stop day dreaming.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao held his head and following him back to the classroom pitifully. Looking at the chart, he saw Jiang Yang\u2019s name and his eyes widened in surprise: \u201cFuck! Jiang Yang, why are you together with Qin Xu?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The whole class: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words were spoken very well. Although everyone understood that he was actually saying; \u2018Your mum, why did the teacher put you two together?\u2019 but just hearing his words, it could easily be understood okay?!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was made speechless. He then noticed a few students talking quietly to each other. The content of their conversations were basically the same as what Huang Shao had said and that is; why is the teacher putting those two together? They would already have disputes despite being seated so far away. Now that they are together wouldn\u2019t there be wars every single day?</p><br/><p>Hearing those words, Jiang Yang felt a little complicated inside. Had he always been perceived by his classmates as such an impatient bomb that would explode anytime, anywhere? He had already planned everything out. In the future he would ignore Qin Xu and act like he didn\u2019t have a desk partner. If he doesn\u2019t provoke him then the well water will not mix with the river water and they would both be fine.</p><br/><p>Although this seemed obvious, the other students knew Jiang Yang better than he himself. It couldn\u2019t be said that Jiang Yang had a bad temper. If you don\u2019t step on his bottom line then he would naturally not explode but Qin Xu is different. Every time Jiang Yang\u2019s eyes meets his, all his patience disappears and he would lash out instantly.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Jiang Yang listened and subconsciously looked towards Qin Xu\u2019s direction only to see him sitting there lazily with his arm resting on the back of his chair and looking in his direction. Just looking at his eyes it was obvious that he had heard everything.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t understand what the meaning behind Qin Xu\u2019s gaze was but the moment their eyes met he felt an inexplicable sense of guilt. He purposely moved his eyes away and broke eye contact.</p><br/><p>The other classmates saw this and immediately had the same thoughts: See? That\u2019s how it is.</p><br/><p>After half an hour everyone had moved according to the new seating plan and greeted the students sitting around them.</p><br/><p>During the first evening class following the change in seating plan, Jiang Yang and Qin Xu only looked at each other once and did not talk to each other throughout the whole class. In the end everything was able to pass smoothly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang breathed a sigh of relief and thought that if things continued like this, then everything would be okay. At present, Jiang Yang could be considered to have gotten used to the existence of the system. With the fact that Qin Xu is asleep and would not know about it, he had also begrudgingly accepted the task of helping cover Qin Xu with his blanket which appeared for the past few nights. Apart from these slight changes, his life continued as usual.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang who thought this quickly slapped himself back to his senses. The next day when he went to buy breakfast at the cafeteria the system suddenly spoke up: \u201cRandom task: Please help Qin Xu buy breakfast. Time limit is half an hour. If you fail there will be a punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang stood in front of the window and almost snapped his meal card in half when he heard this. This damned system!</p><br/><p>His face darkened but it was useless getting angry. He could only dully say: \u201cAunty, can I have one more?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the Aunty handed the last bag of cheese bread to him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang took this and walked quickly back to the classroom. He took the opportunity when there weren\u2019t many people around and shoved it into Qin Xu\u2019s desk.</p><br/><p>With a guilty conscience his actions were very sneaky but he managed to successfully complete this task.</p><br/><p>When Qin Xu returned back to classroom and sat down beside him lazily, Jiang Yang\u2019s was still a little nervous. He was worried that he would notice something and find out but Qin Xu only laid down onto his desk and went to sleep without sparing him a glance.</p><br/><p>When the morning study session ended, Qin Xu reached into his table to find his meal card and was preparing to head down to the canteen. Reaching in, he found a bag of bread still emitting the wondrous scent of cheese.</p><br/><p>He asked: \u201cWho did this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The surrounding students heard this and just looked at each other. No one spoke up to reveal themselves.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe walked over to Qin Xu and sat on the seat in front of him while grinning: \u201cIt must be from one of the girls with a crush on you. A love breakfast. You haven\u2019t eaten yet right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu never accepted things like this. He frowned and placed it aside, \u201cI\u2019m not eating it. You should help me find out who left it here and give it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe shrugged indifferently, \u201cThey did it so secretly, how can I find out their identity so easily? Even the students who came to class first didn\u2019t see it. Otherwise you can check the monitoring system?\u201d</p><br/><p>Checking the monitoring system. This was naturally something that Qin Xu couldn\u2019t do. For something like this there is no need to waste his effort. He just coldly shook his head.</p><br/><p>During this conversation, Jiang Yang was eavesdropping while feeling very nervous. At the end he was able to breathe a sigh of relief.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Xie Zhe knew that Qin Xu wouldn\u2019t eat it but if he threw it out and if it was discovered by the girl then she would be very hurt. He just laughed, \u201cSince you\u2019re not eating then give it to me. I like to eat this but when I got there I was too late and it was all sold out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu nodded, \u201cGive me milk in exchange.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe: \u201cYou really are something. I don\u2019t have milk with me. Why don\u2019t I accompany you to go and buy it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl in the aisle across from them heard their conversation, took out a carton of milk from her table and hesitantly handed it over, \u201cThat\u2026..Qin Xu if you don\u2019t mind I have one here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled and said: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl was disappointed and she could only retract her hands, \u201c\u2026\u2026..Oh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe looked at them meaningfully. He then suddenly pressed down onto the table and moved closer to him while saying: \u201cXu brother. Seeing that we are brothers, I won\u2019t tell the others. There is something that I have been wanting to ask you for a long time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu only slightly raised his eyes, \u201cAsk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe smiled: \u201cTruthfully\u2014\u2013 You actually don\u2019t like girls?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change and he only casually responded back: \u201cThat\u2019s right, looks like you found out. I have always liked you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe waved his hand while laughing: \u201cPlease don\u2019t. I won\u2019t be able to accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong></p><br/><p>Jiang Yang (indifferent): Oh so you like Xie Zhe \ud83d\ude42</p><br/><p>Qin Xu (Erkang hand): Let me explain!</p><br/><p>Huang Shao (victory pose): Once again I am a good wingman. Yay ~(^v^)V</p><br/>\n</div>"}

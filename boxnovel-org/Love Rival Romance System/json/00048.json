All that was lacking were a few words \u2014- I choose you, Pikachu!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu felt complicated after being forced into the situation and even being forcefully assigned the cry baby attribute, but he still managed to complete his task very well. He managed to elicit out the reason for their breakup.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu roughly summed it up for Jiang Yang. Chen Ming Jie was just helping Liu Ya Chun out as a classmate and didn\u2019t have anything else going on with her. However, his girlfriend Zhang Wei couldn\u2019t accept this. She said that he\u2019s too dense and doesn\u2019t realise that that girl didn\u2019t have such pure intentions. She demanded that he maintained his distance from Liu Ya Chun but Chen Ming Jie thought that she was just making a big deal out of nothing and was annoyed that his girlfriend doesn\u2019t trust him. Like this, the two argued back and forth and Zhang Wei proposed that they break up out of frustration thus resulting in his sorrowful wails last night.</p><br/><p>After hearing this and seeing Chen Ming Jie\u2019s expression, Jiang Yang felt even more helpless. So they should go find Zhang Wei to figure things out? Why did a third person get involved in this?!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang massaged his temples, \u201cHave you had a good talk with your girlfriend? Or were you both just too stubborn and just think that the other person is in the wrong? As your girlfriend, she is feeling insecure. Don\u2019t you think that you might be in the wrong somewhere?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Ming Jie pondered over this. His expression appeared very conflicted and he didn\u2019t seem to be able to think of a reason for her insecurity, \u201cI told her that I can maintain a distance from Liu Ya Chun but, as a classmate, sometimes there are times where I can\u2019t help but need to help out\u2026.she said that I\u2019m not the only male student in the class\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He said this slowly and towards the end his voice started getting softer. He couldn\u2019t accept this relationship ending but he also couldn\u2019t understand why it ended.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t like to go around in circles and just said straightforwardly: \u201cGo find that Zhang Wei and tell her directly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Ming Jie: \u201c\u2026..Eh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang said this and turned to leave. It looked like he was ready to go find her and Chen Ming Jie just dumbfoundedly followed behind him. He still had an evil impression of Jiang Yang and was worried that he would hurt his girlfriend\u2026\u2026ex-girlfriend.</p><br/><p>When they managed to find her, they saw her holding hands with Tang Ling Ling. Turns out, they were friends. Jiang Yang recalled that he did indeed see her come to his class a few times to find Tang Ling Ling but he never knew what her name was.</p><br/><p>The two girls were originally chatting cheerfully as they returned from the bathroom but the moment they ran in to Chen Ming Jie in the hallway, Zhang Wei\u2019s expression immediately became cold and she looked away. Even Tang Ling Ling didn\u2019t have a good expression and a hint of hatred was evident.</p><br/><p>And so, the initial plan to try and talk things out failed. Zhang Wei didn\u2019t want to talk to Chen Ming Jie at all.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the bell indicating the start of class rang and they could only return to their respective classes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang also managed to get more details on what had happened through Tang Ling Ling.</p><br/><p>As she explained what happened, Tang Ling Ling\u2019s expression was very unamused because she felt indignant for her friend Zhang Wei, \u201cYou guy\u2019s are really too dense. How can you not see something so obvious? Liu Ya Chun may look all sweet and innocent but she\u2019s actually a green tea bitch. She clearly knows that Chen Ming Jie has a girlfriend, but she still goes and finds him everyday to ask him for help with moving her desk or to help her out with a question. If this isn\u2019t deliberate, then what is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd she is really good with her words. Once, at the cafeteria, she couldn\u2019t open the can for her bibimbap sauce and Zhang Wei kind-heartedly helped her out. She made comments like you\u2019re so amazing, so strong, you can do everything by yourself without needing others to help you out and that on the other hand she\u2019s too weak and frail and wouldn\u2019t be able to even hurt a fly. Saying things like how she is so manly, Zhang Wei was too angry to eat, and she just turned and left. The other students all saw this too. If it was me, I would also be too angry to eat, and I would even smash that tray on her head.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSeveral times, Zhang Wei asked Chen Ming Jie to stay away from her and the result? Liu Ya Chun ran over to Chen Ming Jie to apologise saying \u2014\u2013 She must have misunderstood us, I\u2019ll go and explain it to her. I actually just want to be good friends with her, but it looks like she doesn\u2019t really like me. Explain? Bullshit! She clearly intends to anger Zhang Wei to death! The key point though, is that Chen Ming Jie is too stupid. Is he blind? Or is his head filled with paste instead?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Jiang Yang could feel a headache coming. To think that it would be this complicated?! Are you sure this is a school life story and not a drama about scheming courtesans?!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt extremely regretful. He was so regretful that even his intestines turned green. He definitely did not want to be involved in this chaos. If it was a guy then he could just sort things out by giving him a beating but it just happened to be the opposite. He felt extremely tired.</p><br/><p>He was annoyed and wanted to just walk away from the situation but the moment his eyes met with Qin Xu\u2019s, the words \u2018give up\u2019 couldn\u2019t leave his mouth. And so, he could only stubbornly keep his mouth closed and not say a word.</p><br/><p>At the cafeteria during lunch time, Jiang Yang, Qin Xu, Huang Shao, Tang Ling Ling and Zhang Wei coincidentally sat at the same table. Because Zhang Wei had just broken up, as her friend, Tang Ling Ling accompanied her to help her with getting over her grief. It just happened that Jiang Yang and the others we\u2019re involved with this and Huang Shao and Tang Ling Ling also happened to be childhood friends. When he saw that they couldn\u2019t find any seats, he waved them over and allowed them to join their table.</p><br/><p>The dining table at the cafeteria is one of those long metal benches and if they shuffled down, they could make space for them. Tang Ling Ling and Zhang Wei sat on the ends facing each other and Huang Shao and Jiang Yang sat next to them respectively. Next to Jiang Yang was Qin Xu. Because Zhang Wei is from a different class, they were not very close, and she could only chat with Tang Ling Ling but because the master of socialising, Huang Shao was there, it wasn\u2019t awkward at all. He could pull out countless interesting topics to talk about non-stop and this allowed the whole table to be enveloped in a rather good atmosphere. Now that Jiang Yang and Qin Xu had gotten closer, it was much easier creating a warm environment.</p><br/><p>They sat at the table chatting while having their lunch and it didn\u2019t take long for someone else to come over and stop in front of Zhang Wei. With a gentle voice she asked: \u201cHuh? Zhang Wei why aren\u2019t you eating with Chen Ming Jie?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person who asked this just happened to be a sweet and innocent looking girl with hair just past her shoulders.</p><br/><p>As soon as she saw her, Zhang Wei\u2019s expression turned into disgust. She replied with a tone of impatience: \u201cWhy do you care so fucking much about who I\u2019m having lunch with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and Qin Xu who didn\u2019t know her easily guessed that the girl must be Liu Ya Chun.</p><br/><p>She frowned slightly and appeared to be upset. She bit onto her lower lip and said gently: \u201cGirls shouldn\u2019t swear so easily. It\u2019s not good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling heard her speaking in a soft and slow manner, to the point that it almost sounded greasy, and replied in annoyance: \u201cCan\u2019t you fucking speak properly? After doing those things, you dare act so fake? Can you please just leave? You\u2019re ruining my appetite!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ya Chun\u2019s eyes turned red and she quickly lowered her head. Along with Tang Ling Ling\u2019s bad attitude towards her, anyone who witnesses this scene would think that she was just bullied.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang poked at his food with his chopsticks and was even more annoyed than Tang Ling Ling. He obviously just wanted to eat and sleep in peace!</p><br/><p>After a moment of hesitation, he spoke up and looked up at the girl standing at the end of the table, \u201cAre you Liu Ya Chun?\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl sniffled a little and looked up at Jiang Yang\u2019s handsome face with tear filled eyes before gently nodding her head, \u201cYes, you are\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment she said those words, Tang Ling Ling immediately scoffed. She did not believe that Liu Ya Chun would not know about Jiang Yang. To be more accurate, almost everyone in the school knows about him, even the first years who have only been here for only half an year!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang calmly replied: \u201cI\u2019m Jiang Yang. I wanted to ask, do you like Chen Ming Jie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ya Chun turned red and immediately denied this, \u201cOf course not, we\u2019re just friends!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu watched her look at Jiang Yang while blushing and denying any romantic inclinations with Chen Ming Jie and couldn\u2019t help but associate this scene with the scenes he had seen on those popular teenage dramas on TV. The male lead would have a misunderstanding and get jealous, the female lead would try to explain and then their relationship with start progressing afterwards. Qin Xu frowned and suddenly felt unhappy. He reached out to Jiang Yang\u2019s plate and grabbed a piece of his meat, temporarily drawing Jiang Yang\u2019s attention. Despite being glared at, he wasn\u2019t scared at all. Under Jiang Yang\u2019s wondrous gaze, he stuffed the meat into his mouth.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was unhappy and naturally wanted to retaliate. He grabbed a bigger piece of meat from Qin Xu\u2019s plate and, in an instant, they started fighting over their food. This left Liu Ya Chun hanging on the side to dry. She stood there awkwardly with her face red and, after biting on her lip for a while, she forced out a smile and said: \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else then I\u2019ll go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWait.\u201d Jiang Yang suddenly called out and stopped her. With a calm and cold tone, he continued, \u201cSince you don\u2019t like him, then can you please stay away from him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he said this, everyone at the table fell silent. Liu Ya Chun\u2019s expression also stiffened in surprise.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had always had poor EQ and he didn\u2019t know how to give someone face. At this moment, all he thought was that it was quite simple. Since Liu Ya Chun doesn\u2019t like him, then the third party could just be removed, and the problem would be instantly resolved. The couple could then have a good talk with each other and if they want to get back together or break up, it is their choice. Like this, they can make a clean decision and he would no longer need to suffer through those tears.</p><br/><p>Liu Ya Chun tried to maintain a weak smile as she replied bitterly: \u201cThat is just Zhang Wei\u2019s misunderstanding. Chen Ming Jie and I are just classmates. Why do you all think that I am in the wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang nodded: \u201cYou are not wrong with getting along with him but what can you do when he has a girlfriend? As someone of the opposite gender, isn\u2019t it natural that you should keep a distance from him to avoid any unnecessary misunderstandings? Like this, it\u2019s good for you and for them.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI was just occasionally asking him to help me out with a few questions that I couldn\u2019t answer\u2026\u2026\u201d Liu Ya Chun tried to explain with tears. The tears lingered at her eyelashes as her eyelids trembled slightly making her whole demeanour appear even more pitiful.</p><br/><p>However, Jiang Yang was not moved by this at all, \u201cAs far as I know, his grades aren\u2019t particularly good. Apart from him, I\u2019m sure there are others you can ask?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Yang felt very refreshed seeing this and added: \u201cI recall that the top student in your class is a girl. Her results are much better than Chen Ming Jie\u2019s so why don\u2019t you ask her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ya Chun: \u201cShe\u2019s busy\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling retorted: \u201cAre you saying that the other person is too cold and wouldn\u2019t want to help you? Also, do you think that Chen Ming Jie is not busy? You\u2019re taking up all his time for dating!\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ya Chun\u2019s shoulders trembled, \u201cI didn\u2019t mean it that way, don\u2019t misunderstand\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Finally, seemingly finding the situation to unbearable, she covered her face and ran out the cafeteria. Several students who didn\u2019t know the details as to what had happened looked on with interest.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao sighed and shrugged, \u201cSo, did we just all join together and make a girl cry? All of us against her alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling coldly snorted: \u201cI don\u2019t care what others think.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao shook his head, \u201cLing Ling, you shouldn\u2019t speak like that. Didn\u2019t you see Liu Ya Chun crying so pitifully? Your words were too harsh, so others will think that you were bullying her. You should learn from her a little, aren\u2019t tears a women\u2019s greatest weapon\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish speaking, Tang Ling Ting suddenly smashed her plate and stood up imposingly. She glared and Huang Shao and said: \u201cYou want me to learn from her? Fine then, we\u2019re over!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao watched her stomp out the cafeteria with a shocked expression. Even Zhang Wei who was pulled along by her looked back at him and gave him a dirty look: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned around to Jiang Yang and the others and they conversed silently through their eyes.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao \u2014\u2014\u2014 What did I do to offend her?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang &amp; Qin Xu \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013 You\u2019re finished.</p><br/><p>After fussing around for half a day, the group didn\u2019t manage to solve the sleeping problem and even made Tang Ling Ling and Huang Shao\u2019s relationship fall apart. Every time they met, the other would turn their head away with no intention of wanting to see him. Despite being enemies, Jiang Yang and Qin Xu would argue and fight to vent their anger so seeing this cold war going on, they couldn\u2019t help but find it rather scary.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao initially thought that he didn\u2019t do anything wrong. He was just joking around and teasing Tang Ling Ling the way he had always been. With her temper being like those of a boy\u2019s, she would easily be the one who suffers in the end, particularly when she is up against a girl like Liu Ya Chun so he wanted to draw her attention to her weaknesses.</p><br/><p>But later, he gradually realised that Tang Ling Ling was truly angry. Since young, Tang Ling Ling had always hated being the one who is protected. During their elementary performance, she even competed with the boys for the role of the prince. Recalling that performance at that time, Huang Shao couldn\u2019t help but want to laugh\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>Forget it, maybe he should just\u2026..apologise? But an apology is naturally impossible. Huang Shao is too proud to admit his mistakes so, instead, he went to the school store to buy Tang Ling Ling\u2019s favourite snacks and gave it to her to silently give her as his apology instead. Unfortunately, Tang Ling Ling simply refused it and, as if she was righteous government worker, she resisted the bribe.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao sighed and could only silently retrieve the snacks and eat them himself. With the potato chips in his left hand and shrimp chips in his right hand, he crunched on them unhappily.</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d Explode into a pufferfish! Does this guy have any sincerity? Shouldn\u2019t he try it a few more times and after a couple more refusals, she could reluctantly accept it?! Why isn\u2019t he doing this properly?!</p><br/><p>But unfortunately, Huang Shao just happened to be this type of steel straight man. If she said that she doesn\u2019t want it, then he thought that she really didn\u2019t want it and could only eat it himself to avoid wasting food. And so, this reconciliation plan of his failed and his relationship with Tang Ling Ling continued to be stagnant. Even when the teacher assigned them group work, they would allocate each other tasks and at the very end put it together without a word.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao sighed and continuously tried to think of ways to mend their relationship, but he couldn\u2019t figure out any effective countermeasures. He then accidentally came across a scene he had often seen in TV dramas. It was like he had just uncovered a national secret but in a school setting, and not as extravagant.</p><br/><p>He returned from the school store and suddenly had the urge to urinate. He couldn\u2019t wait until he could go upstairs and couldn\u2019t wait for Jiang Yang and Qin Xu. He proceeded down the corridor to the closest bathroom to solve his problem. But before he could walk in, he heard someone whispering. With his tendency to find gossip, how could he let this go?</p><br/><p>And so, he threw away the idea of going to the bathroom and secretly hid in the corner listening in. As he listened to them talk, he couldn\u2019t help but find one of the voices very familiar, so he looked out to check who it was.</p><br/><p>Standing behind the wall just happened to be Liu Ya Chun and her good friend.</p><br/><p>Liu Ya Chun stood next to the wall and she used her nails to impatiently scratch at it. In her voice was viciousness that he had never heard before: \u201cThey broke up on their own will, what does that have to do with me? To even run over and blame me and speak bad of me in front of others. That\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her friend said: \u201cThat\u2019s right. Just because her relationship isn\u2019t going well, she\u2019s pushing the blame onto someone else. If she really likes him then she wouldn\u2019t misunderstand him so easily. In the end, it\u2019s all because they don\u2019t trust each other enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Ya Chun\u2019s expression was no longer innocent and pitiful. Instead, she gnashed her teach and vented her anger by stomping on the weeds in the corner. She mercilessly pulled the weeds out as she cursed violently: \u201cDamn them! Damn them! Those two stupid women how dare they curse at me! Fuck! They should just go die!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her friend hurriedly held her down and reminded her with a whisper: \u201cCalm down. If you\u2019re too loud, you\u2019ll attract attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>After fiercely cursing out, Liu Ya Chun felt slightly better, but she still remained cold and disdainful, \u201cThis location is very remote. No one will come.\u201d Although she said this, she still lowered her voice.</p><br/><p>\u201cApart from that Zhang Wei, I didn\u2019t even do anything to that Tang Ling Ling so why is she targeting me. Such manly girl like her, how can there be boys who would like her? She\u2019s so nosy, it\u2019s disgusting. I can\u2019t let this go.\u201d Liu Ya Chun picked at her nails while her expression looked particularly wretched.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to find someone to help you get revenge? Find Jiang Yang and Qin Xu to explain? But I heard that they seem to like Wu Tong. She is childhood friends with that Huang Shao so maybe you can give that a try.\u201d He friend understood her well and carried the conversation on.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao who hid in the corner stiffened. He had just sent a message calling Jiang Yang and Qin Xu over to join him in watching this good show unfold and he suddenly heard his name?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and Qin Xu had just arrived and didn\u2019t understand what was happening. They raised their eyebrows at him \u2014 Did you call us over to show us the fact that someone is interested in you?</p><br/><p>Huang Shao quickly waved his hand in denial and pointed to the girls behind the wall to indicate to them to continue listening to what they have to say.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat guy?\u201d Liu Ya Chun pursed her lips, \u201cI don\u2019t like him. But, seeing Tang Ling Ling like that, I\u2019m sure even a guy like him won\u2019t want her. She\u2019s dark skinned, flat chested and even poorly proportioned. How pitiful. Why should I fight against someone as pitiful as her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just from her voice, you could imagine her saying this in a very condescending manner. It was as if she was the queen or something.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao heard this and exploded. He couldn\u2019t restrain himself \u2014 What do you mean a guy like me? What\u2019s wrong with Laozi?! I can\u2019t bear this!</p><br/><p>He was angered to the point that he had lost all reason and he no longer hid himself. He directly jumped out from his hiding spot and confronted them before Jiang Yang and Qin Xu could stop him.</p><br/><p>\u201cClassmate, you don\u2019t like a guy like me?\u201d Huang Shao revealed a twisted smile. \u201cDid you think that I would be interested in you? Ah? With that flat face, thick waist and stumpy legs? Who do you think you will go well with? Jiang Yang or Qin Xu? Stop dreaming and look at yourself in the mirror. Although they may be just a little more handsome than me, do you think they would be interested in someone I am not interested in? What a joke.\u201d</p><br/><p>From the moment Huang Shao jumped out, Liu Ya Chun\u2019s expression immediately changed. After a moment of panic and shock, she tried to cover things up but, after hearing the words from his mouth, her face twisted into a wretched expression and she could no longer remain calm.</p><br/><p>After firing out a series of insults, Huang Shao could feel his anger gradually diminishing. He fiercely stepped forward with an unpleasant expression on his face and half squinted at the person before him.</p><br/><p>He said with a cold voice: \u201cAs a girl you have a very cheap mouth. Be careful you might get beaten to death.\u201d</p><br/><p>It had to be said that Liu Ya Chun was terrified. Her whole body shook uncontrollably.</p><br/><p>However, Huang Shao didn\u2019t care. He threw out a threatening warning and turned around preparing to leave. After a few steps, he seemingly remembered something and looked back at Liu Ya Chun with a radiant smile, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Earlier you said that no-one will want her? \u2014-I want.\u201d</p><br/><p><em>(KKnotes: Ok I just have to add here that when I read that line, I actually squealed. I SHIP!)</em></p><br/><p>And then he walked off without looking back. In his actions, clear resentment and dislike towards Liu Ya Chun was evident. Liu Ya Chun on the other hand was angered to the point that her face went pale.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and Qin Xu who watched the wonderful drama unfold before them also turned to head upstairs. Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but express, \u201cThat Huang Shao really is something. It would have been great if Tang Ling Ling saw this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled and waved his phone, \u201cShe already heard it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was surprised. This guy\u2019s fast. Amazing.</p><br/><p>Although he didn\u2019t say it out loud, his thoughts were evident just by his expression. Qin Xu very naturally accepted his praise and nodded his head in affirmation.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d This guy is still as shameless as ever.</p><br/><p>Before returning to the classroom, they also made a detour to class nine to find Chen Ming Jie. They patted his shoulder with a heavy heart and said: \u201cIn your case, you shouldn\u2019t be dealing with love. Study hard every day and get into a good university. There\u2019s only 531 days left until the college entrance examinations. You should cherish it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Ming Jie was confused and he couldn\u2019t understand what they were saying. But because he was still a little scared of Jiang Yang, he could only nod obediently.</p><br/><p>On the way back to class, they also bumped into Liu Ya Chun and her friend who was on their way back to class. The other party was lost in thought for a moment but still managed to maintain a small smile on her face when she saw them.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that Jiang Yang and Qin Xu had already seen her other side. Suddenly encountering her, they couldn\u2019t help but feel a little awkward. They reflexively looked away and acted like they didn\u2019t see her as they headed to their classroom leaving Liu Ya Chun standing in the corridor with an unsightly expression.</p><br/><p>The situation this time was a mess, but it was also an experience that they could learn from. Later, they heard that Chen Ming Jie and Zhang Wei still did not get back together. Because of what had happened, Zhang Wei felt strongly that men were unreliable and a waste of time. She devoted herself completely to her studies and very quickly threw away any thoughts of having a boyfriend. As for Chen Ming Jie, he was in low spirits for a long period of time. Eventually, he realised that studying was the only thing he could do and so he also buried himself in his books.</p><br/><p>With this farce coming to an end, the result could be said to be quite good as there were now two more students who are diligently studying. If the teachers knew about this, they would be very pleased.</p><br/><p>As for Jiang Yang and Qin Xu, after finishing their speech with Chen Ming Jie, the system notified them that their punishment was over and the two no longer needed to stick together.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was stunned for a moment and momentarily felt a little complicated inside. He then quickly recovered. Of course, he should be happy. At least he could now go to the toilet in peace.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu heard the notice from the system and stopped his steps. After becoming lost in his thoughts for a moment, he quickly caught up to Jiang Yang and looped his arm around his shoulder while chuckling: \u201cGoing to the toilet? Let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang glanced at him helplessly but, perhaps it was because he had gotten used to the intimacy, he didn\u2019t shake him off.</p><br/><p>Afterwards.</p><br/><p>Class five continued as usual and Huang Shao and Tang Ling Ling also returned to their typical bickering fights. Tang Ling Ling continued to be a cheerful and outgoing girl while Huang Shao maintained his usual optimistic demeanour.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>The bell indicating the start of class rang. It was time for self-study and everyone was still rowdy. They temporarily calmed down as they got ready to study, read novels, or play games but at this moment the classroom door opened, and a teacher walked in. With authority, he announced that they would be having math lessons now and all their dreams were instantly shattered. The students below mourned for the loss of their self-study class.</p><br/><p>The students were sad, and their eyes were filled with resentment \u2014 Math teacher, you\u2019re so cold. So ruthless. So unreasonable!</p><br/><p>The math teacher remained calm \u2014\u2013 I\u2019m not listening. Not listening. Open your books now.</p><br/><p>The students naturally couldn\u2019t defeat the experienced teacher and could only dejectedly listen to him. But as young and lively adolescents, they couldn\u2019t help but start whispering to each other and fiddling around.</p><br/><p>After the math teacher gave out two warnings, he patted the table and yelled out: \u201cWhy do I hear noises every time I speak!\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao raised his hand and answered: \u201cTeacher, if you don\u2019t make a sound when you\u2019re speaking then how can we learn?\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacher choked and almost saw red with anger. He was tempted to crush the chalk and say \u2014- Fine then. Since you\u2019re so great, why don\u2019t you teach the class. But the teacher maintained his reason and only answered with irritation: \u201cHuang Shao, you come up and do this question.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao walked over, picked up the chalk and stood in front of the board for a while as he scratched his head. He then honestly said: \u201cTeacher, I don\u2019t know how to do it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The teacher sighed, \u201cThen pay attention to class and stop disturbing the others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao nodded his head obediently, \u201cOkay teacher.\u201d</p><br/><p>On his way back to his seat, he also reminded the other students, \u201cEveryone don\u2019t be noisy and pay attention to class. The teacher is getting tired from yelling at us so much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, the teacher couldn\u2019t say anything. He could only stand at the podium and express that he is very tired.</p><br/><p>The other students gloated at his misfortune while silently feeling distressed for the teacher for encountering someone like Huang Shao.</p><br/><p>Not only that, Huang Shao was also the typical representation of a worm in class that would transform into a dragon after class. The moment the bell rang, he instantly leapt out of his chair and bounced around everywhere. When he returned, he would often clutch his chest and say to Jiang Yang: \u201cOh no, this is the feeling of falling in love!\u201d. It would happen whenever he encounters a good-looking female student.</p><br/><p>When he finds out that the other party has a boyfriend, he would be heart-broken for one second and cry pitifully while hugging onto Jiang Yang\u2019s thighs. If this happened in the past, Qin Xu would just ignore his antics but now he couldn\u2019t help but find it dissatisfying. He kicked Huang Shao aside and lied: \u201cThe class teacher is looking for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao cried out in anguish before reluctantly heading over to the school office. In between classes, he once again came over to find Jiang Yang to report Qin Xu. He said things like; Qin Xu that devious guy cheated me and that he\u2019s jealous that I have a good relationship with you.</p><br/><p>Although he said those words jokingly, those words were not a lie. Jiang Yang and him could be considered as having grown up together. From sixth year of elementary school until now, they have maintained their relationship for 5 years. With Jiang Yang\u2019s bad temper, for him to be able to endure someone as frivolous as Huang Shao for so long, it could be said to be true love.</p><br/><p>It was the same this time as well. After Huang Shao\u2019s miserable begging, Jiang Yang promised that he would help him level up. Afterwards, Huang Shao even specially took screenshots of their team winning and sent it to his groups of dog friends to show off his achievements.</p><br/><p>\u201cI am getting closer and closer to the king\u2019s road HAHAHAHA [Hand on waist laughing.jpg]\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDespise [Picking nose]\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMiddle finger.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Yang is your true love. Don\u2019t try and cheat me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c+10086.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao swiped through the conversation filled with insults directed at him and wasn\u2019t affected at all. He continued to show off and very quickly typed a few more words \u2014\u2014\u2013 You guys are just jealous. Laozi and Jiang God shared the same pants growing up. Laozi has someone to carry me and you guys don\u2019t LOLOL.</p><br/><p>\u201cI have never seen such a brazen person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..Excuse me, please leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEr Huang, please continue. My forty-metre sword is ready to cut you down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu looked at the lively group chat that endlessly moved up his screen and felt dissatisfied. He wanted to grab Jiang Yang by his shoulders and shake him while yelling, how can you do this to me? Am I not important to you anymore?! We\u2019re clearly\u2026\u2026he paused for a moment. After thinking for a long time, he added \u2014-We\u2019re clearly friends!!!</p><br/><p>And so, filled with jealousy, Qin Xu\u2019s finger moved a few times and the chat interface on Huang Shao\u2019s end suddenly stopped moving. The gray words at the bottom said \u2014\u2013 You have been kicked out of the group chat.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..Meow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Weekend.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang stayed at home eating and drinking while unscrupulously playing games. With skilful operations, he cleanly dealt damage to two enemies within a few seconds. His speed was so fast that the other party didn\u2019t have the time to realise that they had died until their body had already gone cold. Once again, he won, and this time he was even named the MVP. He smiled smugly and was proud that he was such a king-player.</p><br/><p>Just as he intended to start another game, mother Jiang\u2019s voice travelled into his room from outside: \u201cLook at you, every time you come back, all you do is hide in your room playing games. Your body is about to be destroyed. Go outside and walk around for a bit. And help me buy a bottle of soy sauce.\u201d</p><br/><p>Soy sauce? What a joke. He\u2019s the invincible king-player. He\u2019s not afraid of anything and you dare ask him to go get soy sauce?</p><br/><p>Mother Jiang again yelled: \u201cYou\u2019re still not moving? Get going!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang silently placed down his phone and felt a little wronged, \u201c\u2026..Oh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he may be the invincible king, he still couldn\u2019t go against something as terrifying as his mother. He listened to her words obediently and went outside with his phone. He was even looked at by mother Jiang sternly: \u201cWhy are you bringing your phone? Don\u2019t go and find a place just to play games.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026.I\u2019m just using it to pay for the soy sauce. Not playing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother Jiang: \u201cA true man is true to their words, otherwise they\u2019re a dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d I\u2019ve already been called a dog so many times.</p><br/><p>The king-player who was driven out of the house, wearing a T-shirt and shorts, walked down the road bleakly.</p><br/><p>According to his great mother\u2019s words, he naturally couldn\u2019t go back home too early and should walk around for a bit outdoors, so he wasn\u2019t in a hurry to buy the soy sauce. Instead, he bought a matcha flavoured ice cream cone and walked around while eating it as he looked for a place to sit down and play on his phone before going back.</p><br/><p>He wandered around bored and passed through a small park. On the grass were some elderly people and young children wandering around after dinner and there were also aunties getting ready for their afternoon dance. Several young children sped past him on their skateboards.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang watched them for a while before taking back his gaze. The sound of a dog barking drew his attention and his eyes followed to find the source of the sound. Next to him just happened to be a small bench and a small poodle sat on it with his beady black eyes moving around everywhere in excitement. Its body was covered in dark brown curly fur and if you didn\u2019t look clearly, you would have mistaken it for a toy poodle. Filled with spirit, it had its tongue hanging out of his mouth and it very cheerfully panted.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang found it very cute and couldn\u2019t help but bend over to pet it. The fluffy feel of its fur was very good, and the small poodle also responded very positively. It barked back very excitedly and jumped up onto its pair of short hindlegs.</p><br/><p>Then, Jiang Yang felt a pair of hands fall onto the top of his head and ruffle it up a few times before a low-pitched voice coaxed: \u201cBe good, good boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026..???\u201d</p><br/><p>He subconsciously looked back and was met with a familiar handsome face.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s hand was still on his head and with a fake surprised expression, he continued to rub the top of his head as he said: \u201cJiang Yang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt the hand on the top of his head mischievously ruffling up his hair and immediately swatted his hand away in annoyance. Through gritted teeth he said: \u201cDo I fucking look like a dog?\u201d</p><br/><p>He then sneered as he stuffed the remaining ice cream cone into Qin Xu\u2019s mouth and agilely pushed the other person over onto the bench and retaliated by messing up his hair. With both his hands, he kneaded and ruffed with Qin Xu\u2019s hair and distorted his face into all kinds of funny expressions.</p><br/><p>The two men scuffled around like this and just as they were concentrating on the fight, a little girl walked over with a look of curiosity. She pulled out the lollipop in her mouth and shouted into the distance: \u201cMum, there are two brother\u2019s fighting!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu had only just managed to take out the ice cream cone and returned the gift by stuffing it back into Jiang Yang\u2019s mouth. With a small smile that clearly indicated that he did not have any good intentions, he waved at the little girl and said: \u201cLittle sister, you\u2019re mistaken. This is my boyfriend. I\u2019m am just flirting with him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was stunned by this guys ability to speak nonsense but, with his mouth stuffed with the ice cream cone, he couldn\u2019t speak to clear up the situation. The little girl then yelled out: \u201cMum, it\u2019s okay! The brother says that he\u2019s just flirting with his boyfriend!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was scared to the point that he had almost swallowed the ice cream cone whole. He glared ferociously at Qin Xu and even kicked him aside before turning around and planning to leave. However, just as he lifted his foot to move, he felt a small resistance coming from his leg. Looking down, he saw the little poodle biting on his pant leg holding him back.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unable to get rid of it, Jiang Yang could only bend over to pick up the dog. He intended to force it over to Qin Xu but when he looked up, he saw Qin Xu holding hands with a little boy who looked to be about five or six years old. With a white and tender cheeks, and in a small yellow t-shirt and denim pants, the child stared up at him curiously.</p><br/><p>That face was quite similar to Qin Xu\u2019s. Both of them also had something tied around their wrists which joined them together\u2026..Isn\u2019t that a parent-child rope? (<em>KK: See image below</em>)</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang held onto the poodle and froze for a moment before blurting out: \u201cYour son?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu laughed: \u201cAs such a handsome and charismatic man like me, do you think it\u2019s possible?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang just smiled and replied: \u201cHow can it not be possible? You should be more confident in yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d Hehe. Why should he be confident in something like that?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang managed to leave Qin Xu at loss of words and felt his mood improve. All the dissatisfaction he had earlier when he was treated like a dog by him quickly dissipated. He held the poodle out and planned to hand the dog back to him but just as the poodle got closer to Qin Xu, it started to bark madly. It was as if it had just encountered an enemy and was responding to him with vigilance and very fiercely.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was a little surprised, \u201cIsn\u2019t this your dog?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu nodded and then shrugged his shoulders. It looked like he had become accustomed to this treatment, \u201cBut, I have never been liked by small animals.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t know about this. After a moment of surprise, he ridiculed him: \u201cIt\u2019s probably because animals can differentiate between good and bad. You\u2019re clearly not a good person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu rolled his eyes and, seemingly remembering something, he suddenly leaned forward to the point that his face almost touched Jiang Yang\u2019s: \u201dIf our souls are exchanged again, lets try and see if it still likes you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had gotten too close and his warm breath could be felt on his ears. Jiang Yang subconsciously shrank back to increase the distance between them. He then saw Qin Xu single-handedly pressing down on the poodles\u2019 head in his arms. No matter how angry and how loud it is, its\u2019 short legs could not reach his hand and could only flail around aimlessly in the air.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang saw this and couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the poodle has such intense dislike for Qin Xu, Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t understand why he would take the dog out for a walk.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu naturally pointed to the child next to him, \u201cMy nephew. Relying on him.\u201d</p><br/><p>So to say, the big one is taking the small one out for a walk and the small one is taking the poodle out? It\u2019s something like that?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang laughed and then casually glanced at the time. He decided that he should stay a little longer and sat down to play games with Qin Xu. At this moment, it was time for team battles, so they pulled Qin Xu\u2019s nephew in as well. The three of them sat in a row playing the game while the poodle ran around occasionally licking and sniffing at things around it as it pleased. However, every time it passed Qin Xu, it would have a look of disgust on its face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

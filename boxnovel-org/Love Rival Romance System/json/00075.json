Little Qin Xu could be described to be a little devil. The moment they met, he ran into his arms like a bullet and cried out: \u201cDaddy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was confused. With me so young, how can I have such a big son like you?</p><br/><p>Later he learnt that this little devil was particularly bold and deliberately escaped from the nanny who took care of him. He wandered around happily and, when the police uncles notice him, he would find a nearby friendly-looking person to pretend to be their family and wait until the police uncles walk away to finally admit that he had recognised the wrong person.</p><br/><p>He actually had this little trick up his sleeves.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was slightly shocked, but he had to admit that Qin Xu that guy had beast like instincts that allowed him to accurately distinguish between good and bad people. With this skill of his, this trick was actually quite feasible.</p><br/><p>After discovered that this little devil is pretty assertive and does not need any concern, Jiang Yang turned around and left. But after just a few steps, his expression turned complicated and he turned to look at the little tail following behind him. With a bit of helplessness, \u201cWhy are you following me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The child just grinned and didn\u2019t speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you\u2019re not speaking then I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, as soon as he turned around, the little tail behind him immediately returned to a cold and indifferent expression and casually followed behind him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang stopped. He bent down in front of him, \u201cLittle guy, are you lost?\u201d</p><br/><p>The child immediately shook his head, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>The child said reluctantly: \u201cMy home is in this direction.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang shrugged and then stood up. He strode forward quickly and turned around two corners. The child\u2019s legs are short, so he could only run after him. When he lost Jiang Yang he pouted his mouth and for a moment he was sad.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Jiang Yang appeared out of nowhere and said, \u201cYet you said that you\u2019re not following me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The child ran over and instantly grabbed onto Jiang Yang\u2019s trouser legs.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at his little face and his heart eventually softened. He asked: \u201cWhat is your name? Where do you live? I\u2019ll take you home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Qin Xu\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was shocked. Is he the Qin Xu that he knows? This little bean before him, Qin Xu?</p><br/><p>On the way, he held the little boy\u2019s hand and talked to him until they reached his home. Jiang Yang also didn\u2019t know the reason, but the moment little Qin Xu saw him, he immediately trusted him completely. Because of this, when it was time to part little Qin Xu wasn\u2019t happy about it.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you have to go? Can\u2019t you stay with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I also have to go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen, then\u2026..Then I\u2019ll marry you. You can be my wife and we can live together and play together!\u201d Little Qin Xu was seemingly happy about this idea of his. His face was bright, and he looked over at Jiang Yang expectantly.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He teased, \u201cOnly girls can be wives. I\u2019m a boy so how can you marry me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Little Qin Xu stubbornly shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t care. Mummy said that if I like someone, they should be my wife and I should only like one person. I like you, so you are my wife. I don\u2019t care if you are a boy or girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang laughed for a moment before pursing his lips, \u201cHow can you speak so well at such a young age? You probably have lots of girl friends in class?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could little Qin Xu let his wife misunderstand? He immediately explained: \u201cNo, they are all too immature.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cImmature?\u201d Jiang Yang smiled and flicked his forehead, \u201cYou\u2019re also a still a little boy yet you say that about other children?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that I\u2019m immature. I\u2019m not a three-year-old little child, I\u2019m a seven-year-old big child!\u201d Little Qin Xu seriously refuted.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang smiled, \u201cYes, yes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you are my wife!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang continued to answer perfunctorily, \u201cYes, yes\u2026..wait, no!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou already agreed so you can\u2019t take it back. If you take it back, you\u2019re a puppy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d You act like this and yet you say that you\u2019re not immature.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>When they woke up in the morning, the dormitory began their usual routine of opening their eyes and washing up. During this time, both Jiang Yang and Qin Xu felt a little complicated. After they finished getting ready, they naturally went to the cafeteria for breakfast together.</p><br/><p>On the way, Qin Xu grinned and said: \u201cMy system is gone. I also had a very special dream last night. What about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at him with a relatively cold reaction. But if you looked carefully, you would see that the corner of his lips was slightly raised, \u201cMy system is gone too but I didn\u2019t have a dream.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d Qin Xu was a little in disbelief. He walked forward a few steps and then turned around to face Jiang Yang. While walking backwards he said, \u201cI saw what you were like when you were young. Super soft and cute. I even told him that I like the future you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang snorted and acted like it didn\u2019t concern him but his ears slightly reddened. He still wasn\u2019t used to Qin Xu\u2019s straightforward love talk that would appear from time to time.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu also said, \u201cI also used a magic trick to trick the younger you. I said that I would only teach my wife and you agreed to be my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu grinned, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you believe it? But, I can also be your wife. You should take me in, I\u2019m easy to take care of~\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201cGet lost.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled very greasily: \u201cWhere can I get lost to? Get lost in your heart?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu continued to grin. It was like his mouth was smeared with honey and all the words that came out were sickening sweet. Jiang Yang felt uncomfortable being stared at by him for so long and felt his face heating up.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu naturally also saw this. He hooked his lips up and smiled even more happily.</p><br/><p>After getting together, they no longer had the gap between them and they started getting stuck together almost constantly.</p><br/><p>On the weekend, Jiang Yang would go and stay over at Qin Xu\u2019s place with the excuse to study together but in fact\u2026\u2026.it was naturally a chance for them to act lovey-dovey.</p><br/><p>To avoid feeling guilty, in addition to playing games Jiang Yang would still work on his homework like a good student.</p><br/><p>The two of them sat together at a table completing their homework. Jiang Yang had his head lowered while his pen scratched onto the surface of the page as he solved the questions. He could be described to be working seriously but there was a very immature person, like a child with ADHD, who would restlessly glance over at Jiang Yang and reach out to touch him.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yang Yang, do you want to eat fruit? Biscuits? Are you thirsty?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yang Yang, look at me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHey, you finished a subject. Let\u2019s take a break.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>After a while, Jiang Yang finally exploded. He turned around and glared at him, \u201cBe quiet.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that look of warning, Qin Xu fell silent. Unfortunately, the ferocity behind those words weren\u2019t enough and it didn\u2019t take long for him to once again start playing up.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was a little angry, \u201cI already told you to keep quiet. If you continue to be noisy I\u2019ll\u2026\u2026I\u2019ll kiss you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s eyes suddenly brightened.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026..\u201d What is wrong with me?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang wrinkled his brows in annoyance and wanted to act like he didn\u2019t say anything. He looked down and continued to complete his homework but the person next to him couldn\u2019t calm down. Compared to earlier, the ruckus that he created far surpassed the previous incidents and there was an indescribable excitement hidden in his actions.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang maintained a straight face and acted like he didn\u2019t see anything. He continued to tackle the problem seriously and treat the person next to him like air.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu sprawled over the table with his chin resting in his arms. He tilted his head to look at him and complain with dissatisfaction, \u201cYou\u2019re a liar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t laugh or cry. While holding onto the pen he turned and looked over at his wronged expression. Jiang Yang shook his head and sighed before the corners of his lips formed a soft smile. No matter how hard he tried to keep a straight face, he couldn\u2019t completely conceal the smile. He moved over and leaned down to drop a kiss onto Qin Xu\u2019s lips. It was a very light touch that was gone the moment he felt it.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu blinked in daze. He wasn\u2019t satisfied at all. It\u2019s no better than not kissing! After tasting the sweetness, he wants more okay?!</p><br/><p>\u201cDo your homework. Also, exams are coming soon.\u201d Jiang Yang continued saying this with a steel face and he didn\u2019t pay any attention to his coquettish advances. He said that after finishing their homework, they should review for the exams.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu wasn\u2019t reconciled by the kiss. He continued to harass him in a low voice and Jiang Yang eventually exploded. He smacked his hand on the table with ferocity.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu reflexively dodged backwards and vigilantly guarded himself, \u201cYou can\u2019t hit me. Kisses are a boyfriend\u2019s rights. I\u2019m not in the wrong!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang stalled for a moment before snorting out a laugh. The anger inside him had completely dissipated. He did his best to make a stern expression and say: \u201cIf you keep quiet and don\u2019t disturb me now, when we\u2019re reviewing later, we can kiss based on the situation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was happy. He immediately asked: \u201cWhat type of situation can we kiss?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang glanced over at him, \u201cWe will talk about it after you stay quiet for a while. If not, the agreement is void.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu again asked: \u201cIn addition to a kiss, are there any other benefits? For example\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that meaningful smile of his made Jiang Yang\u2019s scalp numb. He decisively refused, \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu raised his eyebrow, \u201cI haven\u2019t said it yet. How do you know what I was going to say? I just wanted a hug. Where did your thoughts run off to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang glared at him.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu grinned, \u201cHonestly, Xiao Yang Yang did you want to\u2026\u2026\u2026.?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026Get lost. Starting now. If you make noise, the promise earlier doesn\u2019t count.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu immediately shut up. He blinked a few times and made an innocent and harmless expression, but it only made Jiang Yang grit his teeth in annoyance. After getting along with this guy for so long, he understood that the cold and indifferent demeanour that he had initially was all fake. He\u2019s too thick-skinned. He couldn\u2019t believe any of his expressions at all! And Jiang Yang just happened to be bad at dealing with him like this. When he suddenly softens down and pretend to be pitiful and spoiled, he clearly knows that it is a trap, but he would still happily jump in! Jiang Yang really felt speechless at himself.</p><br/><p>With motivation, Qin Xu\u2019s speed sped up to the point that it looked like his hands were flying over his homework. His eyes stared at the papers so passionately that it looked like it would soon ignite into a fire. With so much passion and fighting spirit, if their teacher were to see it he would definitely feel proud. But if the teacher found out that he was only like that so that he could kiss his boyfriend the teacher would definitely vomit blood \u2014\u2014\u2014 It\u2019s the young people\u2019s world now. I\u2019m old now.</p><br/><p>When it was finally time for them to review, Qin Xu was filled with expectations. He looked over at Jiang Yang with doe-like eyes. The light that flashed inside it was almost blinding.</p><br/><p>What he was most curious about was obviously the rules. What should he do to get more kisses? He thought this inside and started thinking of various plans. Jiang Yang however didn\u2019t tell him. He just smiled and said: \u201cI\u2019m not saying. It\u2019ll depend on your performance.\u201d</p><br/><p>That was very mean of him. Doesn\u2019t that just mean that he would make the decision himself? But Qin Xu wasn\u2019t too disappointed. The advantage of this was that Jiang Yang would take the initiative himself to kiss him. If he didn\u2019t think that it was enough, he could whinge and complain for more so it\u2019s not a big deal. Also, the fact that he doesn\u2019t know about the rules made it rather exciting.</p><br/><p>Of course, the most important thing was that Qin Xu knows that Jiang Yang is like him. Both are lively and energetic young men so how could he mistreat him?</p><br/><p>At the beginning of the session, Jiang Yang asked questions and Qin Xu answered.</p><br/><p>It started with questions that were easy to answer and Qin Xu was filled with confidence. He thought that he probably would get as many rewards as the number of questions he got correct. But only after five questions, the questions started becoming very specific. They just happened to be the type of questionsthat Qin Xu wasn\u2019t particularly strong at answering. He mulled over it for a while and, under the pressure of Jiang Yang\u2019s count down, Qin Xu managed to throw out the correct answer. He smiled particularly brightly and looked over to Jiang Yang while blinking a few times like a big dog begging to be rewarded.</p><br/><p>But Jiang Yang just pursed his lips and seemingly appeared unhappy. He threw out another question that was even more difficult. Qin Xu stalled for a moment. He had just successfully completed a question, but he didn\u2019t get a reward and instead he deliberately gave him one that was more difficult? He lowered his head in disappointment. This question was one that he really didn\u2019t know the answer to. He racked his brains as Jiang Yang started counting down and could only dejectedly throw out a random answer that he knew was incorrect.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, Jiang Yang shook his head and said coldly: \u201cWrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu pouted and was little annoyed. He felt that Jiang Yang didn\u2019t want him to be rewarded so he deliberately made things difficult for him. The rules were also set by Jiang Yang and he didn\u2019t want to tell him. He was being very bad.</p><br/><p>Then, the \u2018bad guy\u2019 that was being cursed out internally by Qin Xu bent his head down while his hand rested on his shoulder and gave him a kiss on his lips.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is your punishment.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the kiss, Jiang Yang slowly retreated and calmly sat back down. He even unconsciously licked his lips.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was stunned. He looked at him dumbfoundedly. He didn\u2019t expect him to suddenly kiss him. When the other person had already moved back, he was filled with regrets. He should have grabbed that person and deep kissed him. But he still managed to get the reward. Qin Xu instantly let go of his anger and just grinned happily: \u201cIsn\u2019t this a reward?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang almost couldn\u2019t keep his face straight. The fingers in front of him twitched slightly revealing his inner state that is completely different to his external indifferent expression. He stressed with a calm expression: \u201cOne wrong answer and you get punished with a kiss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smirked, \u201cThen that must be the sweetest punishment I have ever seen. I\u2019m so troubled.\u201d</p><br/><p>For the next question, Qin Xu could answer it, but he deliberately said, \u201cAh, so hard. I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang again bowed his head down and kissed him. He then added: \u201cI almost forgot to say, if you get more than three wrong, I\u2019ll be sleeping in the guest room tonight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026!!!\u201d What is this? Why didn\u2019t you say so earlier! He only has one chance left?!</p><br/><p>In an instant, Qin Xu became nervous. He felt that the remaining questions were demons that wanted to render him dead! For a moment, Qin Xu was aggrieved. That miserable appearance of his made others seeing it also feel bad.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked away and secretly laughed.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

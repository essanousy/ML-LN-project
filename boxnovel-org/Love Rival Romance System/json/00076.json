His eyes were burning every minute and his entire body was tensed. It was as if every question was a mountain obstructing him from acting lovey-dovey with Jiang Yang and he had a strong desire to destroy it!</p><br/><p>After answering another question incorrectly, Qin Xu no longer had any more chances to make a mistake. But it wasn\u2019t just himself that was nervous, even Jiang Yang was influenced by the atmosphere and was feeling nervous. He thought about whether he should change the questions into simpler ones, but the exams were coming up and it would only make him feel guilty if he did so. In the end, he just asked the questions that he already prepared and quietly left out the last question.</p><br/><p>In the end, Qin Xu racked his brains trying to answer the questions that he wasn\u2019t good at and managed to answer correctly. Not only he breathed a sigh of relief, even Jiang Yang subconsciously relaxed.</p><br/><p>It was now Qin Xu\u2019s turn to test Jiang Yang. It also just happened to be the subject that he wasn\u2019t good at \u2013 physics.</p><br/><p>Before they had even started, Qin Xu began thinking up little plans, \u201cYour punishment was pretty good. I think I should do it too.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang shook his head, \u201cThat is my rule. You can\u2019t use it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStingy.\u201d Qin Xu pouted. But he also knew that Jiang Yang wouldn\u2019t be willing so he\u2026..leaned forward and brought his face closer and closer to Jiang Yang\u2019s. He said slowly: \u201cThen I will make my own punishment. If you get one wrong, I\u2019ll kiss you. If you get two wrong, I\u2019ll press you down to sleep. If you get three wrong\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little by little he moved closer and spoke with a domineering tone. His breath could be felt on Jiang Yang\u2019s face, making him very uncomfortable. Jiang Yang didn\u2019t think much, and his hand moved first. In one movement, he covered Qin Xu\u2019s mouth and he gave him a glare warning him not to take things too far.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s mouth may be blocked but his eyes remained energetic. He blinked innocently a few times and then shamelessly stuck out his hand to lick Jiang Yang\u2019s palm.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt the warm and wet sensation on his hand and his entire body trembled. He retracted his hand like he was zapped by electricity and even hid it behind his back rubbing it uneasily.</p><br/><p>For a moment, it was all quiet.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang quickly stood up and walked to the bathroom. Qin Xu behind him complained pitifully that he\u2019s abandoning him. Jiang Yang rolled his eyes. It\u2019ll be weird if he didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>In the quiet and enclosed bathroom, Jiang Yang looked down at his slightly wet palm. He unconsciously imagined Qin Xu\u2019s bright red tongue licking over the surface of his palm. Although he didn\u2019t see it happen with his won eyes, what he had imagined was a lot more erotic than what had actually happened.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at his hand. His ears uncontrollable became redder and redder to the point that it looked like it was about to bleed. But this wasn\u2019t important. What was important was that something came over him and he actually lowered his head down to lick his slightly wet palm. When he realised what he was doing, his entire body stiffened up. He then hurriedly rushed over to the faucet to wash off all the evidence.</p><br/><p>When he came out, Qin Xu sprawled over the table waiting for him. He deliberately pretended to be upset about Jiang Yang\u2019s heartlessness but because of what he had done earlier in the bathroom, Jiang Yang felt a little guilty. He looked away and said: \u201cBe more serious. Do you want to do well in the exams?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu very keenly noticed that something wasn\u2019t right. It was like a wife quickly catching onto the fact that the husband had been hiding from her. He narrowed both eyes and moved over to his side before sniffing him. These actions made Jiang Yang inexplicably nervous.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you feeling guilty? Don\u2019t tell me\u2026\u2026..you did something that you shouldn\u2019t have in the bathroom?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s heart fell. He panicked a little.</p><br/><p>And then Qin Xu continued while rubbing his chin and frowning, \u201cThat\u2019s not right. It was only five minutes. Too fast. Your endurance shouldn\u2019t be that bad\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the rest of it, Jiang Yang naturally understood what he was talking about. He immediately threw out a kick and scolded him: \u201cWhat the hell are you thinking?!\u201d</p><br/><p>And so, Qin Xu was once again beaten up. But he was asking for it, so he didn\u2019t need to be pitied.</p><br/><p>After the sweet review session, Qin Xu went to the kitchen to cook. He had been the one responsible for cooking ever since that one-time Qin Xu insisted to cook for Jiang Yang. Jiang Yang who was ready to mock his cooking took a bite and was very surprised. He had to admit that it tasted pretty good.</p><br/><p>And so, when Qin Xu cooked, Jiang Yang was quite expectant. After only playing a round of games on his phone, he could no longer resist the smell coming from the kitchen. He ran over to give him a hand by doing things like washing the vegetables and taste-testing. As for the chef Qin Xu, he watched Jiang Yang wander around him and felt like the owner feeding a proud cat. It could be said that both parties were greatly satisfied.</p><br/><p>After dinner, they cut up some fruit and the two sat in the living room playing on their phones and watching TV.</p><br/><p>After a while, Qin Xu suddenly came across a page discussing how one can determine how much the other person likes you. All you needed to do was to maintain your gaze with theirs for ten seconds. If they kissed you then it would mean that they really like you. Seeing this, Qin Xu was eager to give it a try. He placed down his phone, patted Jiang Yang and waited for him to look over. When he did he just kept silent and stared at him while looking forward to Jiang Yang\u2019s reaction.</p><br/><p>As for Jiang Yang, he subconsciously turned around only to see the other person staring at him stupidly. With that pair of dark, watery eyes that was filled with desire, he looked like a big dog begging for food. And so, Jiang Yang was confused. After hesitating for a moment, he shoved the strawberry that he was preparing to eat himself into Qin Xu\u2019s mouth. At the same time he guessed that he probably wanted to eat that\u2026\u2026..</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d So angry! But the strawberry is really sweet and delicious.</p><br/><p>He then continued to stare at Jiang Yang and waited to be fed again.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang rolled his eyes and fed him another two before getting frustrated and asking if he had hands. Qin Xu who had hands then picked up the plate of strawberry to prevent Jiang Yang from reaching it and proceeded to feed Jiang Yang. Jiang Yang pursed his lips unwilling to cooperate, but he still opened his mouth to eat it as he passed it over.</p><br/><p>\u201cLast one. Here.\u201d Qin Xu said.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang instinctively responded by opening his mouth but when he turned around, he saw Qin Xu put the strawberry in his own mouth and look over at Jiang Yang with a meaningful look.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Your thoughts are completely written on your face. How can I not understand!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang rolled his eyes. He didn\u2019t want to pay him any attention, but he could see the challenging look in Qin Xu\u2019s eyes. It was as if he was asking if he was too afraid to try. Jiang Yang\u2019s competitiveness surged and so he flew forward to bite off the other half of the strawberry.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang naturally only planned to bite off the strawberry and then leave but how could Qin Xu let him do as he pleased? He was waiting for this moment.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu pressed his head down from the back and used this opportunity to deepen the kiss. The strawberry was soft, and, in an instant, it was crushed between their lips and teeth. Some didn\u2019t end up in their mouths and the juiced flowed down the corner of their mouths making it several times more erotic.</p><br/><p>At the end of the kiss, the two had already tumbled around the sofa as if they had just had a fight. They gasped for air and their eyes met. Seeing the other persons messy clothes, they couldn\u2019t help but laugh.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because before they had become official, Jiang Yang and Qin Xu had a very tacit and familiar relationship so, after it was official, almost no transition was needed. Things like going out on a date was also very natural for them.</p><br/><p>If they didn\u2019t want to play games, they would go out to watch a movie together. They bought the tickets and the popcorn and coke and waited in the waiting area. Qin Xu lazily picked up a couple of popcorn to eat and casually passed them over to Jiang Yang\u2019s side as well. Jiang Yang was busy playing games and just opened his mouth to eat it without much thought. His tongue accidentally touched the tip of Qin Xu\u2019s finger as he did so.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu grinned and then proceeded to pick up more popcorn. He then \u2018accidentally\u2019 licked his own finger.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang originally suspected that he might have accidentally licked his finger but when he turned around to look, he was met with Qin Xu\u2019s nonchalant expression, so he thought that he might\u2019ve over thought things. He then turned back, and his eyes met with a young girl sitting diagonally opposite them. The other party seemingly didn\u2019t expect their gazes to meet and panicked a little.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t care. Instead, he smiled naturally and generously. The girl\u2019s eyelids fluttered, and she became shy seeing the handsome brother smiling at her.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you looking at? Don\u2019t look.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu noticed this and very immaturely moved over to behind him. He leaned onto Jiang Yang and lowered his line of sight forcing him to look back down at his phone.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang hooked up his lips and tilted his head to look at him, \u201cJealous?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang laughed and let out a low chuckle. He admitted to it too quickly. It made it no longer fun to tease him.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu wasn\u2019t happy that he was laughing at him. He reached his hand out to hold on to Jiang Yang\u2019s chin and gently scratched it like he was scratching the head of a small animal. Jiang Yang complained that it was itchy and then proceeded to turn his head away. That action of his made him look like he was the owner of an exceedingly proud cat.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s eyes flashed brightly, and he felt even more eager to touch him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang continued to hide from his hands. When he heard the announcement, he had a expression of relief. He picked up the popcorn and said: \u201cTime to go in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu pouted with a look of disappointment.</p><br/><p>Entering the movie theatre, Qin Xu did not necessarily settle down. When the movie had not reached the climax yet, Qin Xu would grab onto Jiang Yang\u2019s hand and gently squeeze it before moving on to playing with his fingers. The then would slowly insert his own fingers between Jiang Yang\u2019s fingers and form an interlocked hand-hold.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was played around by him until he almost lost his temper. He looked at him with both a helpless and disapproved look but in the end, he didn\u2019t say anything and just allowed him to do as he pleased. It was like when a cat owner constantly tries to grab onto the cat\u2019s paw. After the cat pushed the owner away several times, he still continued to grab for it, so the cat could only give up.</p><br/><p>When the movie was over, they also strolled down the street and bought some snacks. Jiang Yang even accompanied Qin Xu to buy earrings.</p><br/><p>Seeing the dazzling array of styles, it wasn\u2019t easy for them to pick.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled and moved closer to Jiang Yang\u2019s side. He then asked him to pick one for him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang raised his eyebrow, \u201cYou sure?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu nodded his head fervently. His eyes were filled with trust in Jiang Yang.</p><br/><p>And so, Jiang Yang very evilly picked out pair of cherry shaped earrings. It was very feminine and pink and it instantly increased Qin Xu\u2019s charm when he wore it.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu not only bought that pair of earrings, he also deliberately wore it to their class reunion later. When the others noticed, they were very surprised. In fact, Qin Xu wearing those earrings didn\u2019t make him ugly, it just contradicted with his looks. The key point was\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014</p><br/><p>\u201cWoooow! Xu brother, why are you wearing such a girly earring? Spill it, did your girlfriend buy it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu deliberately fell silent for a while before solemnly nodding: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>That act of showing off his love could be said to be a very hateful act towards single dogs. He was already able to leave single life, yet he even deliberately showed it off. That is just too much.</p><br/><p>His friends pestered him unrelentingly asking him to fess up, but Qin Xu only smiled and kept his mouth shut refusing to tell them anything. Very occasionally, he would look over at Jiang Yang and his gaze would soften considerably.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026</p><br/><p>High school life could be said to pass by both very quickly and very slowly. From their second year, they quickly rose to third year and they officially reached the stage where they frantically prepared for the college entrance examination. Time passed by at a very strange pace. In an instant, they had grown up and turned eighteen. They attended their coming-of-age ceremony and instantly realised that they are adults now.</p><br/><p>On this day, everyone wore the formal school uniform as the school wished for them to dress more formally.</p><br/><p>In such an atmosphere, the students could tell that something was different. They listened to the speeches said on the stage with sincerity and then it was followed by a meeting about the college entrance examination where they encouraged the students to toughen up and persevere for the next few months.</p><br/><p>At the end of May, there were only a few more days left until the college entrance examination. The school held its customary shouting event and every year at this time, the first and second years would shout out their messages to the third years in the opposite building. Every floor was filled with students as they prepared to should out encouragement and blessings to the senior brothers and sisters preparing for the exam.</p><br/><p>May your dreams come true. May your future be smooth sailing.</p><br/><p>The third years were in a state of heightened anxiety at this stage and it was an event that allowed to them relax a little and have some fun. Their feelings were very complex, after working hard for so long, the exam that would decide their future is now just around the corner. They were excited, expectant, nervous, scared\u2026..all kinds of complicated emotions could be felt.</p><br/><p>The junior brothers and sisters not only shouted at them, they also shout back and responded. It was just that the contents would slowly go off topic and at the very end, it made people want to take advantage of it. They were probably not going to see some of the classmates anymore or they would find it difficult catching up in the future, so they prepared themselves to say one last thing to the classmate that they had good feelings for.</p><br/><p>Someone started and shouted out \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \u201cXXX, I want to go the same university as you. I like you!\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant, things turned lively. The students started cheering and whistling.</p><br/><p>Next, more and more people started to shout things out as well. Things like professing their love to their loved ones or crushes, making a promise to their future self, making a wish for the upcoming college entrance examination\u2026.Many, many cries came from their energetic and youthful hearts.</p><br/><p>This kind of unorganised, large-scaled event naturally isn\u2019t supported by the school. The teachers would usually just turn a blind eye to it and just make sure the students don\u2019t get hurt from getting trampled over. They would ask the teachers o patrol around and encourage the students to go back to class.</p><br/><p>The usually stern director heard the students confess and his expression instantly changed. He warned then in advance while shouting at the students to return to class: \u201cIf you have time to do these useless things, you should use it to complete a few more questions. It is the most crucial time for you now and every second counts!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDirector Wang! I love you!\u201d</p><br/><p>This confession that came out of nowhere surprised the director as he was scolding the students. He stood there stunned and didn\u2019t know what expression to have. He even forgot to continue scolding the students.</p><br/><p>All the third-year students looked over at the director and suddenly had a non-verbal tacit understanding. They revealed a bright smile and used their hands to project their voice: \u201cDirector Wang, thank you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Director Wang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The usual stern face was suddenly filled with discomfort. He quickly said that they should focus on getting good grades in the exam before revealing a serious expression that no longer looked imposing and asked the students to return to class.</p><br/><p>On June 7<sup>th</sup>, the college entrance examinations had begun.</p><br/><p>The weather was starting to warm up but, to provide the students with a good examining environment, every test room had air conditioners. Like this, they ensured that the heat would not affect the student\u2019s performance and those who are afraid of the cold would bring along a thin jacket just in case.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because they had done so many mini exams prior to the actual examination, they had grown slightly numb to it and was no longer feeling panicked. They just treated it like their usual exams and completed each subject one by one.</p><br/><p>When they were done with the final subject and walked out the examination centre, they had a sense of unreality\u2026\u2026.. Just like that, it\u2019s over?</p><br/><p>Although the college entrance examination was over, there were still many things that had to be done including collecting their student reports, participating in the farewell parties and the like.</p><br/><p>The students remained at school and filled their papers out with all sorts of trivial details. Someone suggested something, and they started secretly conspiring a small surprise.</p><br/><p>At that moment, the class teacher stood on the podium explaining what they should do after the exam and what they should look out for. Suddenly, several knocks on the door were heard.</p><br/><p>The class teacher stopped talking and thought that it was another teacher looking for him. Without thinking, he walked over to open to the door, but he was surprised to see a giant brown bear mascot hiding behind the door. It suddenly jumped out and excitedly waved its hand in greeting.</p><br/><p>The class teacher\u2026\u2026was so surprised he took a step back.</p><br/><p>The classmates warmly applauded, and the entire classroom was filled with joyful and mischevious laughter.</p><br/><p>The brown bear stood in front of the teacher and started dancing freely. With its bulky body, it leapt and jumped and looked surprisingly cute. In the middle, the bear even threw out little pink flower petals over the class teacher. It ended its performance with a bow that was intended to look gentlemanly, but it looked cute instead with it\u2019s plushie-like appearance. The brown bear then handed the class teacher a stalk of rose.</p><br/><p>The class teacher was stunned. He hesitantly accepted the rose but just as he reached out, the brown bear mischievously retracted its hands. It even arrogantly placed a hand on its waist and reached out wanting to shake hands with the teacher.</p><br/><p>The teacher couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He reached out and cooperated.</p><br/><p>This time, the brown bear really did deliver the rose into the teacher\u2019s hands. With wide spread arms, it warmly hugged the teacher. The teacher laughed very gently and hugged the bear back. He even patted it a few times on the head.</p><br/><p>When the hug was over, the naughty bear again started to jump around, attracting the student\u2019s applause. When the little surprise event ended, the brown bear could no longer stand the heat, so it took off the head and revealed a handsome face inside. On his forehead was a fine layer of sweat but he smiled very splendidly.</p><br/><p>It was just what you would expect from a teenager, lively and refreshing.</p><br/><p>The class teacher stood at the podium and looked over at the familiar faces below. He smiled slightly: \u201cOnce you\u2019re out of this door, you will be prospective university students. Over these three years, I have watched you slowly grow up. Every single one of you are amazing in your own ways and you are the best student\u2019s that I have ever hand. I wish you all the best in the future and may your dreams come true!\u201d</p><br/><p>They applauded enthusiastically, and many students\u2019 eyes reddened.</p><br/><p>Over the three years the teacher said many times \u2013 You are the worst students I have ever had.</p><br/><p>But when they graduated, the teacher was left with reluctance and grief \u2013 You are the best students I\u2019ve ever taught.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

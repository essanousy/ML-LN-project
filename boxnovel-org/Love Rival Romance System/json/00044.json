The exams were not conducted in their usual classrooms. Instead, all the students were randomly arranged into different examination rooms.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao and Jiang Yang just happened to be allocated to the same room. When he went over to find Jiang Yang, Jiang Yang was still acting like an anxious father. He constantly reminded Qin Xu: \u201cRemember to answer the questions seriously.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao found this amusing, \u201cWhy do I feel that you are more concerned about his results than he is himself? Let\u2019s go, the other students have already left.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was pulled away by Huang Shao but, after a few steps, he didn\u2019t forget to send Qin Xu a warning glare.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu shrugged: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. You should as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then raised his hand and threw something over.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang saw something fly over and instinctively caught it. When he looked down, he saw that it was actually a chocolate bar.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao raised his eyebrows: \u201cHey, it isn\u2019t Valentine\u2019s Day today though?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang rolled his eyes and said with irritation: \u201cToday is April Fool\u2019s Day, your day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao smiled and held out his hand: \u201cSince it\u2019s my day, where\u2019s my gift?\u201d</p><br/><p>This guy is shameless to the point of no return. Jiang Yang was speechless.</p><br/><p>With bright eyes, Huang Shao looked at\u2026\u2026\u2026the chocolate bar in his hands.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t hesitate to tear open the wrapping. Opening his mouth, a clear crunch was heard, and he turned to smile at Huang Shao. This was all done with one fluid motion.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Explode into a puffer fish!</p><br/><p>The midsemester exam went on for two days and soon it was over. As they did the exam, the teachers also corrected the papers, so the results came out very quickly. The moment it was released, some were elated while others were disappointed.</p><br/><p>When the class teacher announced the results, as usual, he announced how the overall class went in comparison with other classes first. This was then followed by which subject was the best and which was the worst. After saying all this, he naturally moved on to announcing the more prominent individuals including those who improved the most and the opposite.</p><br/><p>The class teacher looked towards Jiang Yang and Qin Xu and said with a smile: \u201cIn addition, I would like to praise Jiang Yang and Qin Xu. Their results have improved significantly and it goes to show that it really helps when students help each other out. The other students should learn from them. Huang Shao, the English teacher told me that you regressed again this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>He deliberately placed Huang Shao\u2019s name together with Jiang Yang and Qin Xu because he knew that they got along well and wanted to use this as a chance to stimulate Huang Shao. Look at them, they\u2019re studying so hard and yet you\u2019re still playing around.</p><br/><p>In this regard, Jiang Yang and Qin Xu could only say: \u201cHehe.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao then grabbed onto their legs and fake cried, \u201cWhat happened to agreeing be study slags together? How can you so heartlessly abandon me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and Qin Xu grimaced. They couldn\u2019t tell him the reason behind their hard work recently and could only respond with a cold scoff: \u201cWho agreed to that? I love studying. Studying makes me happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other students watched on and laughed. They patted his shoulder, \u201cXiao Huang, the college entrance examination is not far away. You should start working hard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao didn\u2019t change his expression and continued to whine: \u201cYou bunch of traitors. There\u2019s still more than a year left. The happy high school life has only just begun!\u201d</p><br/><p>After the midsemester exams, it was time for the sports festival.</p><br/><p>The students didn\u2019t have class for two days, so they were naturally very excited. They got ready to passionately embrace their youth.</p><br/><p>At the opening ceremony, coloured smoke was set off decorating the clear blue sky. With this, the festive mood was ignited.</p><br/><p>The competitions also kicked off.</p><br/><p>Each class had an allocated place on the sports field. They moved their chairs down from their classrooms and formed a crowd surrounding the field in the centre. However, there weren\u2019t many people there. Most of them had ran into the centre of the field to prepare for the races or to cheer for the others.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe next race is the second year mens 1.5km. Please check in at the registrations desk. The next race is the second year mens 1.5km. Please check in at the registrations desk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The loudspeaker transmitted this across the field.</p><br/><p>At one corner of the racetracks, there were chairs scattered around and a sign with Year 2 (5) was placed before them</p><br/><p>In the very last row, a tall and handsome figure leaned back lazily in his chair with his long legs resting on the chair before him. On his face laid a comic book and only his chin and his slender neck was exposed. Under the warm autumn sun, he slept very comfortably.</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Yang! It\u2019s time for the mens 1.5km!\u201d A bright male voice rang out and warmly reminded.</p><br/><p>At this time, the man reached up and moved the comic book from his face. He glanced through the corner of his eyes and asked: \u201cIt\u2019s your turn?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang stood to the side warming up. He gave him a perfunctory answer, but his expression didn\u2019t look too good and there was a hint of impatience on his face.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu knew the reason for this and could only quietly laugh. As if it had nothing to do with him, he once again placed the book on his face and prepared to go back to sleep. It\u2019s a wonder how he could sleep in such a rowdy environment.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang heard his laugh and angrily kicked his chair leg. With that strong kick, the chair shook, and Qin Xu also shook to the point that the comic book had fallen from his face. Fortunately, his reaction was fast, and he quickly reached out to steady himself.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu chuckled: \u201cWhy did you kick me? It\u2019s not my fault you\u2019re doing the 1.5km.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI hate the look of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere\u2019s someone who would hate the look of someone as handsome as me? They must be ill. Should get it treated.\u201d Qin Xu pretentiously acted surprised and then jokingly gave him a word of advice.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was speechless. This guy is really the cheekiest person he has ever seen.</p><br/><p>However, he had only said two words and Jiang Yang had already walked off in irritation. He strode over to the centre of the field revealing his striking strong and lively back view.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu leaned back and continued to use lazily the comic book to block the sun on his face. When he opened his eyes again, he was awakened by the cheers around him. In fact, he actually had not fallen asleep. He threw the book onto the chair next to him and blinked a few times. When he sobered up, he remained sitting there for a moment lost in thought. As if he suddenly made a decision, he suddenly stood up and walked towards the field.</p><br/><p>At this moment, there was the fire of the starting gun.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang started running. The main focus of long-distance running is not speed but perseverance. From the start, one should run at a stable and constant space to conserve energy and when they\u2019re on their final lap, they should seize the opportunity and sprint with all their might.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu stood to one side and looked back at the familiar figure on the race track that was getting closer and closer.</p><br/><p>As Jiang Yang approached him, Qin Xu also lifted his foot and started to run with him.</p><br/><p>Only after running for a while did Jiang Yang notice that there was another person running next to him. With surprise, he raised his eyebrows and could help but whisper: \u201cAnother task?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Qin Xu also got a system, every time a task was announced, the two would need to work together to complete it and so the two were usually notified at the same time. But this time, Jiang Yang didn\u2019t hear anything from the system.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu stalled for a moment and even he himself found it a little strange. After frowning in thought for a moment, he smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang found that pause of his suspicious, but he was still in the middle of the competition and didn\u2019t want to be distracted. Therefore, he only said those two words and went back to concentrating on the running.</p><br/><p>Long-distance running tests one\u2019s willpower. When you reach the end, you would reach an exhausted, heart racing and throat burning state. With every breath, your chest would burst with pain and your legs would start feeling as heavy as lead. Every step forward would feel heavy and it is an overall difficult feat.</p><br/><p>At this moment, having someone accompany you running is very helpful. With someone by your side constantly cheering for you and reminding you the fact that the end is near, the athlete themselves would feel energised.</p><br/><p>However, a classmate would usually just run with you for a short period of time; at most half a circle. It is extremely rare to find someone who would run the whole way with you like Qin Xu. For someone to go to this extent to help another person out, how deep must their relationship be?</p><br/><p>The other classmates who saw Qin Xu running along with Jiang Yang were even more surprised: \u201cAren\u2019t they enemies? Why is Qin Xu helping him? Does he have some other intentions in mind? Did he want to stress Jiang Yang out while he\u2019s competing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at that. Do you see Jiang Yang\u2019s face? It looks like he wants to kill someone. Even his speed is slowing down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Another classmate rolled his eyes: \u201cWhat nonsense are you on about? He has almost completed the full 1.5km. Even if he doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s about to die, do you expect him to still look lively? Have been living in a cave? Didn\u2019t you know that they have reconciled?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat? Reconciled?! No way?!\u201d</p><br/><p>The comments made by the shocked onlookers were half correct. Jiang Yang really had an expression that looked like he wanted to kill someone. After almost running the whole way, he felt extremely agonising and could only rely on his own perseverance to continue pushing himself forward. The only thing was, the person he wanted to kill wasn\u2019t Qin Xu \u2014- It was Huang Shao who had signed him up for the race.</p><br/><p>Thinking that his current misfortune was all thanks to Huang Shao, he really wanted to beat Huang Shao up to vent his anger.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao, who had no idea what Jiang Yang was thinking, excitedly cheered for him from the sidelines.</p><br/><p>In the final sprint, Jiang Yang gritted his teeth and pushed himself forward. He passed the only figure in front of him, crossed the finish line and, out of energy, he leaned onto Huang Shao who waited at the finish line to catch his breath.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao smiled very happily: \u201cMaster, you\u2019re amazing. You beat the athletics student and broke the record!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s response was a pat on his shoulder and a dark smile that revealed his teeth: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, it\u2019s all thanks to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao saw this and felt his back go cold: \u201cWhat does that have to do with me? Jiang brother you are the best. You\u2019re invincible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang continued smiling: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like that. It was all because of your support that I was able to make it to the end.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He shrank back his neck, and as if he\u2019s a small eunuch who was about to lose his life, his guilty conscience forced him try and placate Jiang Yang. He supported Jiang Yang, \u201cYang brother, you worked hard. Do you want some water?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, just as Huang Shao\u2019s hand reached over to Jiang Yang\u2019s waist to support him, someone else moved faster. He reached out and pulled Jiang Yang into his embrace and made Jiang Yang lean onto his shoulder.</p><br/><p>With cold, dark eyes, Qin Xu stared at Huang Shao\u2019s hands and said: \u201cHe can\u2019t drink water now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao found his hands suddenly empty and was a little confused. When he looked up and saw Qin Xu\u2019s gaze he was temporarily frightened. What is this? Did he do something to anger Xu brother?! He can\u2019t handle being glared at by both of them!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu, who had just finished running, had not yet completely recovered and his breathing was still a little short. He explicably held onto Jiang Yang and had no intention to let go. Jiang Yang found himself suddenly pulled into another person\u2019s embrace and was a little surprised. He thought back the when Qin Xu ran with him and couldn\u2019t help but suspect that it was again the work of the system. Thinking this, he no longer found things strange and instead very arrogantly leaned back and used Qin Xu as support.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu felt this, and his mood improved. His lips curved up and he said to Huang Shao: \u201cWe will head back first.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, he turned and walked away. His hand naturally looped around Jiang Yang\u2019s waist and Huang Shao who saw this couldn\u2019t help but feel very confused. He felt that his IQ was too low, and he couldn\u2019t understand what was going on.</p><br/><p>Back at the seats, Jiang Yang planted himself down onto a chair and rested his arms onto his knees with his legs spread open. After the strenuous exercise, his face was flushed and beads of sweat rolled down his forehead. He pulled his shirt up and used it to wipe away the sweat.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu unintentionally saw the thin waist that was exposed. He threw a packet of tissues over and walked away.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang thought the he had completed the task and left so he didn\u2019t pay him any attention. He picked up the packet of tissues by his feet, ripped it open and used one to wipe away his sweat before resting on the chair. When he turned around, he saw Qin Xu come back with his comic book and use it to fan him. His sweat-soaked hair moved with the breeze. Although the wind wasn\u2019t too strong, it was better than nothing.</p><br/><p>Not long after, Jiang Yang felt a burst of coldness on his face. He subconsciously looked over and his eyes met with Qin Xu\u2019s grin and then at the iced red tea in his hands.</p><br/><p>He was stunned for a moment and immdiately didn\u2019t reach out to accept it. Qin Xu directly pushed it into his hands and asked: \u201cHave you recovered?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was still wondering, he had just finished running and specially went to the school store to buy him a drink?</p><br/><p>Unable to recover his senses, he absent-mindedly gave his thanks but didn\u2019t proceed to open the bottle to drink.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu saw this and suddenly grabbed the bottle from his hands.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026.???\u201d Why are you giving it to me and then taking it back?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu twisted open the cap and then handed the bottle back to him. He then naturally turned the lid over and shrugged: \u201cThank you for your patronage.\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t \u2018you get another bottle\u2019.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang breathed a sigh of relief and the strange feeling in his heart slowly dissipated. What was that weird illusion of being treated as if he\u2019s Qin Xu\u2019s girlfriend?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

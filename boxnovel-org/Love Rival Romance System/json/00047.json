He hesitated for a moment and said: \u201cIt\u2019s just for the night. Can\u2019t you just exchange beds with Xiao Yuxin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu naturally had an excuse prepared. He explained eloquently, \u201cOf course I can\u2019t do that. There is still a lot of distance between the top and bottom bunk so there will still be some tension force. Like this, it is almost certain that I won\u2019t be able to sleep well. Also, the quality of the beds at school isn\u2019t good. If it collapses, then wouldn\u2019t we be a goner? I\u2019m also pretty selective with where I sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang frowned while still in thought. Qin Xu also added to further affirm his position: \u201cI am very particular with cleanliness, so I definitely won\u2019t switch beds with anyone. Don\u2019t even think about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang rolled his eyes: \u201cAnd you can sleep in my bed? You must be very particular with cleanliness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu responded seriously: \u201cI\u2019ve already slept there before so I\u2019m grown used to it now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026Hehe.\u201d You may be willing to sleep on my bed but it\u2019s still a question whether or not I\u2019ll let you.</p><br/><p>He thought this internally, but he could only accept Qin Xu\u2019s proposal. It was terrible just thinking that he would not be able to have a good night sleep. He ensured that he warned Qin Xu in advance to sleep without moving around, to not take his blanket and to avoid touching him.</p><br/><p>Hearing those three consecutive restrictions, Qin Xu wasn\u2019t irked. He instead smiled and said: \u201cDon\u2019t you think we\u2019re like those elementary students drawing a separating line on the desks?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026..???\u201d</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t that something that\u2019s usually done between male and female students? And who would go and draw a line on the bed?!</p><br/><p>In any case, Jiang Yang once again emphasised his words: \u201cRemember what I said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu just smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>After brushing his teeth, Qin Xu followed after Jiang Yang and very naturally climbed into Jiang Yang\u2019s bed.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao was very shocked: \u201cYou\u2019re sleeping together again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin could only facepalm. Did you guys give up hiding it after being exposed the first time?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang who was already sitting in his bed groaned a little inside. He wondered if it was better if he waited until everyone else was deep in sleep before going up to bed\u2026\u2026\u2026.No, there\u2019s nothing between them that couldn\u2019t be seen by others so why should he hide it. Also, with that distance limitation, it\u2019s almost certain that one of them would be pulled over so this is something that couldn\u2019t be helped okay?</p><br/><p>And so, Jiang Yang felt that there was no need to try to hide it and said to Huang Shao from above: \u201cThat\u2019s right, do you have a problem with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao was dumbfounded. With him being stared at, he immediately shook his head. If master has said so then he naturally has no problems with it!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu looked at Jiang Yang\u2019s profile and was in a good mood. Despite usually playing his phone until late into the night, today he was particularly keen to go to sleep. He patted Jiang Yang\u2019s shoulder and urged: \u201cTurn of the lights, it\u2019s time to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang glanced at him and reluctantly laid down. Although he had agreed to it, when it finally was the time for it, he couldn\u2019t help but feel awkward. He laid down on the bed and his entire body stiffened up unnaturally.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu felt this and glanced over at his handsome profile through the corner of his eyes. He smiled a little and mischievously turned over to face Jiang Yang. Because the single bed is quite narrow, Jiang Yang could easily feel his breath on his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cSleep on your back.\u201d Jiang Yang requested stiffly.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy?\u201d Qin Xu deliberately blinked innocently a few times, \u201cI\u2019m used to sleeping on my side and it saves space like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s first reaction was to snort coldly. What a liar! If you like to sleep on your side, then who was that person who liked to sleep all spread out on his back?! You think I\u2019m blind?!</p><br/><p>However, even if he knew that Qin Xu is speaking nonsense, he wouldn\u2019t go out of his way to reveal it. He no longer wanted to bring up his dark history of helping cover him with his blanket.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang directly ignored his words. Feeling uncomfortable, he turned over and faced his back to Qin Xu. The only problem was that, with this, his butt would inevitably come into contact with Qin Xu\u2019s thigh and that unspeakable part\u2026..</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d You mum, this is even more frustrating! Can\u2019t sleep!</p><br/><p>On one side was like fire, the other side was like the calm sea with an occasional wave rippling through. Qin Xu hooked up his lips and was in a good mood. It could be said that he wanted Jiang Yang to feel uncomfortable. If he could completely ignore him and sleep well, Qin Xu would feel unhappy instead.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was annoyed to the point that he couldn\u2019t sleep. He did his best to stick close to the wall but the person behind him made things worse by continuing to stick to him.</p><br/><p>From outside, a ghostly wail travelled into the room. Its\u2019 cry sounded extremely sorrowful, to the point that even those listening would weep along\u2026..To put it simply, it is the pain one goes through when a man and a women breaks up. It just happened that his room was close and things that shouldn\u2019t be heard were all heard clearly.</p><br/><p>Just as they thought the boy would calm down and quieten down now that the lights are off, he seemingly recalled something and once again started wailing. What made Jiang Yang explode was that he even started singing sorrowfully! Even with high notes?!</p><br/><p>Finally, Jiang Yang could no longer hold himself back. He suddenly sat up and yelled back: \u201cIsn\u2019t it just breaking up? Why don\u2019t you just get back together with her tomorrow?! What\u2019s the point of crying and keeping everyone else up?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because of Jiang Yang\u2019s aggressiveness, the other party suddenly stopped crying.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had suddenly sat up and Qin Xu was also awakened by this. He let out a yawn and, half slouching on him, he gently patted his back to appease him, \u201cCalm down, calm down. He should be quiet now. Go sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening for a while and hearing that there were no longer any sounds, Jiang Yang calmed back down. He reluctantly laid back down and finally managed to fall asleep.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the poor heartbroken boy was so scared that his soul had escaped out of him.</p><br/><p>He was originally scared from Jiang Yang\u2019s scolding, but his roommates felt the need to add \u2014\u2014- \u201cThat voice sounds like Yang brother. He\u2019s one of the school tyrants and I heard that the moment he explodes, no one can stop him. He would pretty much fight anyone he meets. I heard he sent someone to the hospital and all the gangsters avoid him when they see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s not just that. I also heard that when he went to the bank, he encountered a burglar. In front of a real gun, his expression didn\u2019t change at all and he even dared to confront that person and flip him over his shoulder\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The person next to him nudged him and whispered: \u201cHey, don\u2019t you think that sounds too fake?\u201d</p><br/><p>The roommate replied: \u201cDon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s not paying attention anyway. Isn\u2019t it better to make it sound as scary as you can? Don\u2019t you want to sleep?\u201d</p><br/><p>And so, through the joint efforts of several roommates, they managed to make Jiang Yang out to be a cold and cruel demon king who wouldn\u2019t hesitate to let blood spill. This scared the heartbroken boy so much that he huddled inside him blankets and trembled in fear.</p><br/><p>The roommates looked at each other. Seems like\u2026.they went too far?</p><br/><p>To try and salvage the situation, they patted the cocoon he had made to comfort him: \u201cIt\u2019s actually not that scary. Go sleep. It\u2019ll all be okay when you wake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was heard by the heartbroken boy but there was no persuasiveness in their words. It was as if they were saying \u2014\u2014\u2013 What a pity. Now that you have angered him, you\u2019re soon going to die. You should enjoy your last sleep and prepare to die tomorrow.</p><br/><p>The next day, what was to come still came. Jiang Yang in particular did not sleep well and was in a very bad mood. He asked Huang Shao to inquire around about which unfortunate bastard had just broken up and wanted to find him and talk to him about life.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu laughed: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me you\u2019re going there to beat him up?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s expression wasn\u2019t good. He raised his eyebrow and looked at him strangely: \u201cWhy am I going there to beat him up?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe atmosphere around you just seems to be saying that. And with your temper, it\u2019s not surprising?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t hesitate to deny it: \u201cI don\u2019t even know him so why am I beating him up? Because I have nothing else to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu raised his eyebrows. Based on what he said, does he mean that he would only beat up people he is close to and care more about? Since he beats me up the most, does that mean that he cares about me?</p><br/><p>If the others heard Qin Xu\u2019s thoughts, they would definitely grab onto his shoulders and shake him aggressively \u2014\u2013 Wake up! You\u2019re becoming more and more M! The moment you fall into that pit, you can no longer be saved!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu didn\u2019t know this\u2026\u2026and just felt very pleased inside.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao\u2019s investigative skills were very thorough and soon he managed to figure out who the heartbroken boy was. He even managed to find out the reason for his break up; it is said that his girlfriend was not happy seeing him and another girl get too close. Huang Shao said emotionally: \u201cTo think he was cheating. He had a girlfriend and didn\u2019t cherish her and now he\u2019s crying about it after everything that he did? That\u2019s too much.\u201d</p><br/><p>But, after all, it was just a rumour. Things like rumours is often not very credible with people attempting to embellish it to make it sound more interesting. Taking advantage of the time between classes, Jiang Yang went to find the boy to try and sort out the problem. At the very least, he wanted to make him promise not to be so loud at night to allow him to sleep in peace.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu naturally followed him.</p><br/><p>From outside the door to the class nine classroom, Jiang Yang stopped a male student who was walking out and said: \u201cHelp me get Chen Ming Jie.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, the boy whose shoulder he had patted trembled and stuttered out: \u201cYou- You\u2019re Yang brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang frowned, \u201cYou are Chen Ming Jie?\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Ming Jie nodded his head and looked like he was about to cry. He mumbled sorrowfully: \u201cAre you here to take my life?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026.???\u201d This person is just heartbroken right? He\u2019s not hurt in his head?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu stood to the side and secretly snickered.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang coughed, \u201cI just came over to ask if you need any help. I hope that you can stop being so noisy at night so that I can sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chen Ming Jie squinted his eyes and was a little doubtful. Then he recalled something, and his eyes quickly reddened. Sniffling, he very soon became teary eyed and very upset\u2026\u2026.The shocked Jiang Yang retreated a few steps back and didn\u2019t know what to do. As a man, why are you crying so easily?! Those who don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening will think I\u2019m bullying you!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt a headache coming and is beginning to regret his decision to try help him patch things up. He subconsciously turned to Qin Xu and nudged his arm while saying: \u201cYou deal with this. You have experience.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu who was concentrating on just watching the show from the side: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026???\u201d Experience? What experience?</p><br/><p>The meaning in Jiang Yang\u2019s eyes was obvious.</p><br/><p>You. Crying. Experience.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026.!!!\u201d</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong>Qin Xu: Even If I like you, how can you sabotage my reputation like that?! Unacceptable!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang silently takes out his phone and shows him the photo.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u2026\u2026.I don\u2019t believe it! It\u2019s photoshopped!!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

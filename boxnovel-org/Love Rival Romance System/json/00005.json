The rest of the students looked on fearing that a big war was about to break out.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu blinked coldly, placed one hand onto the edge of the table and leaned closer while looking down at Jiang Yang from above, \u201cYour box is obstructing the path is it not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Being stared down by those deep and dark eyes of his, you couldn\u2019t help but feel pressured.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang subconsciously leaned backwards and wanted to maintain his distance from him but, just as he started to move, he realised that it would make it seem like he is afraid of him so he kept still and did not retreat. Instead, he stiffened his neck and even leaned closer towards him. The two glared at each other fiercely and both had no intention of backing down. It was as if the first to look away would lose.</p><br/><p>Yet at this time, the clueless Huang Shao had just returned from the bathroom and was skipping into the classroom while holding onto his water bottle. Looking over, he saw this scene and didn\u2019t notice the tense and nervous atmosphere in the classroom. He jokingly asked: \u201cHey, what are you guys playing? Do you need to kiss if you lose? That\u2019s a pretty good punishment~~\u201d</p><br/><p>He finished that statement with several tilde waves while wriggling his eyebrows and even exclaimed that he wanted to join in. The other students wanted to give him a word of advice but the flighty youngster had already rushed over and ruined the atmosphere.</p><br/><p>The student who sat next to Jiang Yang on the other side of the aisle also had just returned and cautiously moved in to move his own box out of the way. He even tried to placate the situation: \u201cMy bad. My box is a little on the larger side so I\u2019ll move it to the back of the classroom.\u201d</p><br/><p>With the bulky box moved away, the obstructed path instantly cleared up and Qin Xu no longer had a reason to continue wasting his time with Jiang Yang. Under the watchful eyes of the onlooking students, he coldly glanced at Jiang Yang. With a long stride, he easily stepped over Jiang Yang\u2019s box, headed to the bin at the back of the classroom to throw away his trash before turning back and once again casually stepping over the box on his way back to his seat.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe who was watching the event unfold was chatting with a female classmate sitting in the front seats. Walking over, he patted his shoulder and asked teasingly: \u201cXu brother, you\u2019re so cool even while throwing away garbage~\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu shook him off and replied coldly: \u201cShut up, I want to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then sprawled across his desk and proceeded to ignore the others.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe didn\u2019t mind this. From Qin Xu\u2019s dull tone he could tell that he no longer was in a bad mood due to waking up early and only wanted to catch up on his sleep. In such a situation, even if he asked a few more questions, Qin Xu would not get angry.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are so strange. It\u2019s more convenient going through the back door yet you felt the need to go through the front. Were you deliberately trying to start a fight with Jiang Yang?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cXu brother, what on earth did you do last night? Played games all night?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Just as Xie Zhe thought he wouldn\u2019t get a reply, Qin Xu coldly replied, \u201cSomething absurd.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe heard this but was confused. Is Xu brother cursing in his sleep?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was in a bad mood. He felt like he was played around by someone and the more he thought about it, the more annoyed he became. He also thought that he was a complete idiot to lose sleep over that incident last night. Eventually, he threw the matter aside and decided to focus on catching up on his sleep.</p><br/><p>After the morning class and the morning exercises, Qin Xu was able to recover his spirits and began to make the most of his time to complete his homework. Unfortunately, despite his mood getting better, it was like God had something else in store for him and the ink in his pen suddenly ran out. Frustrated, he shook his pen a few times causing a few ink splots to stain his shirt. This only irritating him even more.</p><br/><p>Qin Wu threw away the pen and looked for his other one only to find that the other one was in an even worse state and had no ink at all. With school just starting, Qin Xu had not yet entered his learning state and was very poorly prepared for class. Helpless, he could only resign and turn around to borrow a pen from Xie Zhe but he realised that that guy had just left for the schools convenience store and would without a doubt start flirting with girls along the way so he would not be back so soon.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu turned around and looked towards the male classmate who sat across the aisle from him. Just as he turned his head back, he inadvertently met Jiang Yang\u2019s gaze. Jiang Yang stood at the back of the classroom and was heading towards his direction. Behind him was the iron door to the classroom. With the door half open, the sunlight peeking through surrounded him and made him look quite dazzling. Qin Xu couldn\u2019t help but squint his eyes as he looked at him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang seemingly didn\u2019t expect to see him suddenly turn around and froze for a moment when their gazes met.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu naturally didn\u2019t think that he was looking for him and consequently didn\u2019t think much about it. He only glanced at him briefly before reaching out to the table next to him, \u201cZeng Yu, can you\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not far away, as if he was suddenly stimulated, Jiang Yang suddenly walked over and placed a pen onto Qin Xu\u2019s desk while saying coldly: \u201cLending it to you, no need to return it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was stunned. He looked up at him with a look of confusion.</p><br/><p>This was a normal response. It wasn\u2019t that long ago when the two glaring at each other but now the other party is suddenly taking the initiative and lending him a pen? Moreover, how did he know that he needed a pen? Could he be watching him the whole time?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201cWhy are you lending me a pen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked down at him with a look of impatience and clearly didn\u2019t look like someone who was enthusiastically helping out a classmate in need. Rather, it looked more like he was threatening him for money. Thinking this, Qin Xu felt that the situation was so ridiculous that he felt a slight urge to laugh.</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you in need of one?\u201d Jiang Yang threw down the pen and retracted his hand. He crossed his arms across his chest and said arrogantly, \u201cUse it or lose it, I don\u2019t care.\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>For Jiang Yang to suddenly run over, it was obviously because it was the system\u2019s task for him to lend Qin Xu a pen. If he failed this task then he would receive a punishment. Isn\u2019t that non-stop nagging earlier enough of a punishment?! What could be worse than that?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu raised his eyebrows, \u201cNot needing to return it, does that mean that you giving the pen to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang originally didn\u2019t want to lend him the pen and obviously didn\u2019t want a pen that was used by him. Just as he wanted to nod in response, the system in his mind sent a reminder: \u201cIt\u2019s called lending a pen. If you lend something, you must receive it back otherwise borrowing something next time would be even more difficult.\u201d</p><br/><p>To even use popular human sayings, this system is quite knowledgeable. The veins in Jiang Yang\u2019s forehead throbbed and he was a little annoyed but he quickly changed his words and said rudely: \u201cWho said that I\u2019m giving it to you? Of course you have to return it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu stared at him with a look of confusion, as if he was looking at a rare animal. That gaze of his caused the hair on Jiang Yang\u2019s back to stand and he roughly added: \u201cWhat are you fucking looking at!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu, however, laughed suddenly and his handsome face became even more charming. Of course, this had no effect for Jiang Yang.</p><br/><p>\u201cNothing. I\u2019ll return it after using it, thanks.\u201d</p><br/><p>He waved the pen in his hands and was in a pretty good mood. Jiang Yang who was able to successfully complete the task also breathed a sigh of relief and headed back to his seat.</p><br/><p>The student sitting in front of Zeng Yu watched this strange scene and quickly turned to ask Zeng Yu: \u201cThose two, did they reconcile?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zeng Yu was also confused, \u201cI don\u2019t think so, they were arguing earlier today\u2026..\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s just an argument, it doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019ve cut off all ties. Jiang Yang sits so far away yet he still came all the way here to give him a pen!\u201d The girl who interjected was not in the same class as them in first year and had only heard that the two had some sort of disagreement through word of mouth. Seeing the scene earlier, she felt that it was probably the usual petty fights boys usually get into and that they would soon reconcile again.</p><br/><p>However, Zeng Yu had been in the same class as them since first year and was very clear about the situation. If that was considered as a small argument then what happened between them was a huge fight, enough for them to hate each other for over a semester.</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong>Based on the current situation, Player Huang Shao\u2019s wingman score is in the lead.

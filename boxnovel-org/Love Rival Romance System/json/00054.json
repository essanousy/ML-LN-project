All the anger that he had accumulated over the last night was suddenly stimulated by that final poke.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was kicked backwards and almost rolled off the bed. Fortunately, he reacted fast and managed to stabilise himself by grabbing onto the edge of the bed.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang sent him a glare and then angrily pulled the covers over his head as he laid back down to catch up on his sleep. Only a part of his dark black hair could be seen sticking out over the sheets.</p><br/><p>Sitting on the edge of the bed, several thoughts crossed through Qin Xu\u2019s mind. He then inexplicably chuckled a few times. In fact, he had already guessed that probably nothing had happened last night but just the thought of Jiang Yang staying behind to take care of him all night made him feel extremely pleased.</p><br/><p>He lightly jumped off the bed and waddled over to the bathroom. After washing up, his head no longer hurt so he excitedly went out to buy breakfast. On his way he even swayed to the rhythm as he hummed the tune of a small love song.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was lazy. Since there are many shops downstairs including breakfast shops, he would usually just go out to buy it. The owner of shop that he frequently visited long became able to recognise him. It wasn\u2019t just because he visited often, he was also handsome and had a pleasant smile.</p><br/><p>The boss saw him ordering a lot and could tell that it wasn\u2019t just for one person. She joked and said: \u201cBuying breakfast for your girlfriend?\u201d</p><br/><p>If he bought more food, it could be just for a friend, but she deliberately said girlfriend to tease him but what she didn\u2019t expect was that the next second, after Qin Xu received the bag, he replied with a bright smile: \u201cThat\u2019s right. Boss you\u2019re really clever.\u201d</p><br/><p>The boss was also surprised. She had just said it jokingly and didn\u2019t expect to hit the mark. Hearing this, she laughed even more joyfully, \u201cThat\u2019s good. Then to congratulate you, I\u2019ll give you two more fried dumplings. It\u2019s just fried so it\u2019s still hot.\u201d As she said this, she immediately started to bag it up.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu happily accepted it and said: \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo need. You come here almost every day, so I feel bad if I don\u2019t give you something. Help me say hi to your girlfriend. To be able to be with you, I\u2019m sure she\u2019s particularly good looking?\u201d With the steam rising up over the boss\u2019s face, her smile appeared even more serene.</p><br/><p>\u201cOf course. Very good looking.\u201d Qin Xu lowered his head and smiled as he thought of something. He then waved at the boss and turned to leave.</p><br/><p>On his way back, Qin Xu was in an even better mood. There was even a small spring in his steps. It was like he was about to start flying.</p><br/><p>He reached his front door, entered the house and threw the keys into the small bowl on top of the shoe cabinet. He then placed the breakfast on the dining table and checked to see if the other person has woken up yet. When he looked in, he saw that the bed was empty, and the blankets were a tangled mess. He heard the sound of water running from the bathroom and saw that Jiang Yang was currently washing his face. As he lifted his head, the water droplets slid down his face to his chin eventually falling onto his collar and wetting a small patch of it. His eyes were indifferent, and his expression was cold, but it looked inexplicably sexy.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu saw this and subconsciously swallowed and he felt his mouth go dry. He quickly looked down and retracted his gaze before trying to act natural and call out: \u201cI bought breakfast. It won\u2019t taste good if it gets cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang responded and soon went and sat down at the dining table.</p><br/><p>The breakfast was very rich and looked very appetizing. Jiang Yang\u2019s bad morning mood even improved slightly as he saw it. He picked up his chopsticks and started off with some milk fritters which was best eaten whilst it\u2019s hot. With its crispy golden skin on the outside and the tender texture inside, the thick taste of milk exploded in his mouth each time he chewed. Its\u2019 flavour was extremely sweet and delicious.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s mood softened down.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu saw this and his eyes curved happily. He took a few mouthfuls of soy milk to try to cover the smile forming at his mouth.</p><br/><p>After they were almost done, Qin Xu suddenly suggested something that he had thought of on his way back.</p><br/><p>\u201cJiang Yang let\u2019s go travelling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang took a sip of soy milk and in the process stained the corners of his mouth. He then looked over confused and subconsciously tilted his head, \u201cWhy\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he paused. As if he had a suddenly realisation, he asked: \u201cTask?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was stunned for a moment but he quickly reacted and nodded hard, \u201cOh\u2026..right. It\u2019s a task.\u201d</p><br/><p>Being able to find such a perfect excuse, he smiled with satisfaction.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang didn\u2019t notice this and just concentrated on sucking up the remaining soy milk until it started gurgling. He had already gotten used to the system releasing tasks randomly and, although the other party is a little annoying, something like traveling wasn\u2019t something that he was averse against.</p><br/><p>\u201cDid it say where we need to go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu stalled for a moment before shaking his head. Smiling happily, he responded: \u201cNo. Where do you want to go? I\u2019m okay with any.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was very interested in the idea of going travelling. He supported his chin and started to think seriously, \u201cSpeaking of winter, things like ice skating or snowboarding sounds pretty good but it\u2019s already cold enough here so it\u2019ll be like hell over there. My down jacket also isn\u2019t thick enough. I wonder if it\u2019s too late to buy it now\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu watched him knit his brows in serious consideration and felt very pleased. He immediately joined in with the planning and every word he spoke was filled with excitement, \u201cIf you\u2019re afraid of the cold then why don\u2019t we go somewhere south like Thailand? If you go now, you could just wear short sleeve and we can do things like swimming at the beach and eating tropical fruits.\u201d</p><br/><p>This sounded pretty good. Jiang Yang imagined the refreshing scene of a sunny beach with blue sky and emerald green water and proceeded to pull up his phone to search Bangkok\u2019s weather. Seeing that the average temperature was thirty degrees and wasn\u2019t too hot, he happily decided.</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s travel to Thailand.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu watched him nod and secretly fist-pumped. He then thought of something and wanted to confirm, \u201cWill it just be the two of us? You won\u2019t call up the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang answered as a matter of factly: \u201cWhy should I call the others. It won\u2019t be convenient if we suddenly get a task. It\u2019s also a pain trying to hide it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was a little stunned. The corner of his mouth then curved up and he revealed a very satisfied smile: \u201cYou\u2019re right!\u201d</p><br/><p>For the next few days the two naturally contacted each other often to plan out their trip.</p><br/><p>On the day of their departure, father Jiang dropped them off at the airport and nagged at them a few times before leaving. Jiang Yang responded to all of them and felt that his father was overreacting. He had travelled before with his family and knew what to do if anything happened. Furthermore, the place they\u2019re going to is a famous tourist location so there\u2019s no need to worry about the language barrier.</p><br/><p>They took their boarding pass, checked in their baggage, went through security check and customs, and headed to the boarding gate where they sat down and\u2026\u2026.played on their phones.</p><br/><p>Because there was still half an hour until boarding time, the two sat next to each other and formed a team in the game. Before they could finish the first game, Huang Shao suddenly called. It just happened to be right at a key moment, so Jiang Yang just resolutely hung up on him.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao no longer tried to call him from his end after that. He probably could guess why he was hung up on and gave up. Jiang Yang called him back after he finished the game. Just as he was about to ask him what he wanted, a mournful cry travelled over.</p><br/><p>\u201cXiao Yang Yang how can you go behind my back to go on a honeymoon with Qin Xu? Speak! Do you still have me in your heart?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201d He massaged his temples. Despite doing his best to try to hide it, how on earth did this guy find out?</p><br/><p>\u201cLook at you. You don\u2019t even have anything to say. You are so heartless doing this to me. While you\u2019re acting lovey-dovey with each other, I\u2019m left all alone here, lonely and desolate\u2026\u2026.\u201d Huang Shao started wailing while accusing Jiang Yang of his lack of conscience.</p><br/><p>No matter how long he has been with Huang Shao, Jiang Yang would never be able to get used to his habit of dramatizing everything. Hearing those words, goose-bumps couldn\u2019t help but form on his arms. Jiang Yang could sense that the other party had no intention to shut up and felt frustrated. He immediately spoke up: \u201cStop. If you still want to get souvenirs, then shut up.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, Huang Shao immediately fell silent. He then cheekily added: \u201cReally? Then I want ten bags of dried durian!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201cThree bags.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao: \u201cThat\u2019s too little! At least five bags!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201cTwo bags.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao: \u201cXiao Yang Yang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201cOne bag.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao was like a balloon that was punctured. In an instant he became discouraged and just said in a disappointed voice: \u201cFine, three bags it is then. Stop reducing it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201cYou should have said so from the start.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Explode into a pufferfish!</p><br/><p>After hanging up, Jiang Yang subconsciously shook his head. Although he had known Huang Shao for many years, he still found that guy a little scary in some certain respects.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked over at Qin Xu sitting next to him and couldn\u2019t help but nod his head in thought. In comparison, he realised that it wasn\u2019t too bad going on a trip with Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was confused. Although he didn\u2019t understand, he was happy to see the look of affirmation in Jiang Yang\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Travelling. In addition to being a form of enjoyment, it can also be quite tiring. This time Jiang Yang and Qin Xu went abroad alone and, to avoid being making the itinerary too packed and rushed, they opted for a more relaxed style. They even gave themselves a day to stay leisurely at the hotel and maybe swim at the beach.</p><br/><p>Since they\u2019re going to the beach, they naturally would be exposed to the sun for a long time and Jiang Yang was happy to do so. After all, after a winter passes, the tan that he had achieved with much difficulty would quickly whiten back several shades. Using Jiang Yuan\u2019s words, it would become white and dazzling to the point that other girls would look on in envy.</p><br/><p>However, what was strange was that before they went to the beach, Qin Xu insisted that he should put on sunscreen.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang still had the typical straight man\u2019s train of thought: \u201cPut what on? A man doesn\u2019t need sunscreen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201cSunscreen is for preventing sunburns. You\u2019re too biased. Look at the skin that you deliberately tried to tan and ask yourself whether or not it hurt when it peeled.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang waved his hand very nonchalantly, \u201cThat little pain is nothing.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

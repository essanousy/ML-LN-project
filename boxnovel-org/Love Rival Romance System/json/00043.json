The location naturally was at the local McDonald\u2019s. If they were hungry they could eat hamburgers or drink coke if they\u2019re thirsty. They even had the cool air conditioning.</p><br/><p>When Jiang Yang explained the question, Qin Xu chewed onto the straw and slowly slipped at it while spinning the pen around in his hand. With a very bored look, he didn\u2019t look like he was paying any attention. Jiang Yang saw this and felt unhappy. He smacked him on his head and said a word of warning: \u201cPay attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu sprawled over the table and felt like he was going to get sick from studying so much. Exhausted he said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to study anymore. I want to go out and play.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang scoffed coldly: \u201cPlay your head. Can you do that with your shitty results?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu rolled his eyes: \u201cDo you think you are qualified to say that? Even if I answer it randomly, I\u2019ll get more of them correct than you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two seemingly pointed out their middle finger at each other at the same time. They pursed their lips and cursed at each other with a cold and indifferent face: \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After they swore at each other, their mood improved significantly and the two tacitly returned to work on the problems. When they were done, they would throw it over to the other person to correct and then they would take turns explaining the question. While they explained they would scold the other party and call them stupid.</p><br/><p>The afternoon passed quickly, and the intense study session was finally over. Under Qin Xu\u2019s strong request to take a break to relax, they left McDonald\u2019s and entered a nearby virtual reality experience hall. They didn\u2019t leave immediately and ended up hanging around for a while.</p><br/><p>Virtual reality technology has been very popular for the past two years. Not only is it used in various fields for greater convenience, it also plays a big role in the entertainment and gaming field. Almost all shopping malls had opened up a place for virtual reality gaming and, to experience it, it only costed a dozen of dollars so it was very popular amongst young people.</p><br/><p>The experience hall in this mall wasn\u2019t big and consisted of just a small area of the mall sectioned off and a few egg-shell shaped seats. The experiencer only needed to sit in those seats and wear a helmet to be able to see the simulated scene and immerse themselves in the environment with all their senses.</p><br/><p>To achieve a good stimulating effect and to maximise enjoyment, the gaming interface is naturally not something calm and boring. Instead, it was games such as a role-playing shooting game against zombies, escaping from a ghost house etc.</p><br/><p>When Jiang Yang and Qin Xu went to play, a young couple happened to be just before them. Not long after the game started, the girl started screaming and waved her hands around as if she was shooing something away. She even accidentally hit her boyfriend in the chest who could only groan out in pain. The girl continued to remain immersed in the game and when she made contact with her boyfriend she thought she could actually touch the ghost and was very surprised: \u201cFuck, is this for real?!\u201d</p><br/><p>Those who were watching on found this very amusing while her boyfriend had a look that looked like it was saying, \u201cI wasn\u2019t scared of the zombies but was scared to death by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and Qin Xu had not played this before and they couldn\u2019t help but laugh: \u201cIs it that scary? Such a scaredy-cat.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two who were clearly scared out of their wits when they had the ghost story telling session laughed at the misfortunes of other people and didn\u2019t feel embarrassed at all. They even acted as if they weren\u2019t terrified of anything as they entered the contraption confidently and wore the helmet.</p><br/><p>From the beginning, there was only darkness and faint glow from the flickering candle. By their ears, eerie background music played and slowly bore into their brains. They couldn\u2019t see much through in their field of view apart from mottled walls and faint blood stains. They could only walk on slowly down the narrow tunnel.</p><br/><p>Without a warning, a pale face with a dark, empty eye sockets and red tears flowing out of it appeared before Qin Xu. It revealed a ghastly smile and it\u2019s bony fingers reached out to grab your legs causing you to have the urge to climb up to escape.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was surprised, and he subconsciously reached out to grab onto Jiang Yang\u2019s hand. At the same time, he shrank back but, seeing that he could not escape from the ghost, he started kicking at it desperately. It could be said that he has a very strong desire to live.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had the helmet on, so he couldn\u2019t see what Qin Xu was doing but, with his hands suddenly grabbed and feeling the movements from next to him, he could make a rough guess. He couldn\u2019t help but laugh and just when he wanted to say a few words to mock him, as if the game had everything timed well, a dark head with black, with glowing red eyes and messy long hair also appeared behind him.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c!!!\u201d Fuck!</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know whether or not it was just is imagination, but his shoulders also felt a little itchy, as if there really was hair moving on it!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang who was scared to the point of almost wetting himself unconsciously grabbed onto Qin Xu\u2019s hand. He gripped onto it tightly, as if it was his only life-saving straw!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu returned to his senses and his lips curved up as he bent his finger and used it to draw a few circles in Jiang Yang\u2019s palm. He huffed: \u201cAnd you dare laugh at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Until the end of the game, the two didn\u2019t release their hands. The moment their helmets were removed, Qin Xu noticed that his hands suddenly became empty. He looked up and saw Jiang Yang jumping off the seat. He looked back and his eyes subconsciously swept over to the hand that hung by his side.</p><br/><p>It was about time for them to go back. They walked down the road side by side until they needed to split up.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201cCan I ask you a question?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at his smiling face and felt that it probably wasn\u2019t anything good. Also, remembering that he had just made fun of him earlier, he directly refused: \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu naturally isn\u2019t so obedient. He continued: \u201cJiang Yang.\u201d</p><br/><p>The set of dark and deep eyes looked firmly at him. Inside, it was as if there were stars sparkling. The corners of his lips lifted, and a gentle smile appeared on his face. He suddenly called out his name seriously, unlike the usual way he called him when he was asking for a fight.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked over at him with some doubts.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled and asked: \u201cHow many people know about those things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat things?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cApart from me, does anyone know that you are afraid of the dark?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang frowned and immediately denied: \u201cI am not afraid of the dark!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOk ok. Night-blindness. Does anyone else know?\u201d Qin Xu quickly changed his words like he was trying to placate a young child.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was annoyed: \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about you thinking that you\u2019re too pale and secretly trying to tan yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang seriously suspected that he was trying to do something. Those smiling eyes of his made him feel very uncomfortable. He snorted: \u201cYou\u2019re annoying!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about the fact that you like to sing while showering but you can\u2019t seem to sing the right notes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang exploded: \u201cQin Xu, do you want to die? If you want to fight, just say it!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu wasn\u2019t afraid at all. Instead, he laughed very happily, \u201cHow can that be? I was just asking out of curiosity. Those must all be your secrets.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang squinted and said threateningly: \u201cWhat do you want? Tell others? If you dare, I\u2019ll beat you up to the point that you can no longer walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu however shook his head. He obediently replied: \u201cI won\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang raised his eyebrows in surprise. He loosened his fist and sneered: \u201cThat\u2019s good then. I still have those photos of yours in my phone. If you do, I\u2019ll bring you down together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu once again became playful. With a meaningful gaze, \u201cXiao Yang Yang, to think that you love me so much that you want to die together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was stunned. He then wanted to beat him up: \u201cFuck you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu already expected this and quickly avoided his blow. He had fought a lot with Jiang Yang, so he is already familiar with his routine. He basically could tell where he would throw his next punch or kick at. He dodged very skilfully and even joked: \u201cSee, you can\u2019t even bear to hit me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang became agitated and his mind went red. He immediately jumped onto Qin Xu\u2019s back and wrapped his arms around his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026What are you doing? Why are you not doing the same as your usual routine\u2026\u2026..\u201d Qin Xu was stunned. Feeling the sudden sense of warmth on his back, he temporarily couldn\u2019t speak properly from the surprise.</p><br/><p>To avoid having Qin Xu throw him off, Jiang Yang even hooked his legs around his waist and forcefully strangled his neck. What he didn\u2019t expect was that Qin Xu only paid attention to the heat that travelled over to his waist and had completely ignored the pain at his neck.</p><br/><p>\u201cTry saying it again. Let\u2019s see if I\u2019ll beat you up.\u201d Jiang Yang continued strangling his neck as he threatened with a sneer.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because Jiang Yang had both his arms wrapped around him, their faces were naturally very close. When he spoke, warm breath could be felt on Qin Xu\u2019s ear and he couldn\u2019t help but shiver and feel uncomfortable. He eventually compromised: \u201cOkay, okay. Master, you are the best. I\u2019m about to be strangled to death by you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was pretty satisfied with this and planned to release his hold and jump off his back. But before he could do this, two hands suddenly appeared on his butt and pushed him up. Like this, Qin Xu walked on with Jiang Yang on his back.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was completely stunned. He even forgot to apply strength to his grip, \u201c\u2026\u2026What are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu smiled: \u201cDid you think that if you could get onto my back so easily, you could get off easily as well? I won\u2019t let you get off.\u201d</p><br/><p>This crazy bastard!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang cursed at him internally and the two hands holding his butt also rendered his scalp to go numb. He didn\u2019t even consider the idea of strangling back to retaliate and just struggled with all his might to get off.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Qin Xu\u2019s hand strength is no weaker than his. When he is determined to hold onto someone, it is not an easy feat to break free. Moreover, this person is also very shameless. Seeing that Jiang Yang is struggling too hard, he even deliberately patted his ass a few times and said: \u201cStop mucking around.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mucking around? Muck your mum\u2014\u2014\u2013</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had thoroughly exploded. Inside, numerous curses rained down. His back went numb and he could feel his hair stand as his whole body stiffened. With a dark expression, he had the urge to tear Qin Xu into pieces.</p><br/><p>The other person was on his back, but Qin Xu remained unafraid of death. He continued to tease: \u201cHey I have to say though, it feels quite nice.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, he even squeezed it a few times.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.Looking for death!\u201d</p><br/><p>That angry outburst of his sounded like countless bombs going off eventually burning the surroundings down into smithereens.</p><br/><p>After this outburst, Jiang Yang also no longer cared about being civil. Lying on Qin Xu\u2019s back, he started delivering a bunch of blows. Even if Qin Xu released his hold to block his attacks he wouldn\u2019t stop. Jiang Yang\u2019s legs were firmly bond around his waist and wouldn\u2019t release its hold. He decided to first vent out his anger.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since I\u2019m already getting beaten for it, I might as well squeeze it a few more times.</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026..Okay, that only made things worse.</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong>Qin Xu: A true example of pain and happiness coming hand in hand \u256e(\u256f\u25bd\u2570)\u256d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

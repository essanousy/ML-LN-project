To take the first step in becoming friends, one must help the other and demonstrate their compassion for their fellow classmate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The systems monotone voice sounded in his head and Jiang Yang\u2019s first reaction to it was the urge to beat it up. Even if the system didn\u2019t say it, he would still do it because that Qin Xu that guy is currently chatting up Wu Tong and planning to get a ride with her umbrella. No matter how you thought about it, a man and a woman sharing an umbrella while walking in the rain was a romantic scene and very effective for improving positive feelings for the other party. Jiang Yang sneered. How could he let him do as he pleased?</p><br/><p>Although it was something that he had intended to do originally, the moment the system said those words, it made it seem as if he was following its instructions. This made Jiang Yang felt a little irked and his expression naturally wasn\u2019t very good. He forcefully pulled Qin Xu over, increasing the distance between him and Wu Tong.</p><br/><p>This sudden move of his surprised Wu Tong slightly but soon her expression returned back to her usual soft smile and said: \u201cJiang Yang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tong\u2019s voice is very unique. Unlike the soft and mellow tone most girls had, she has a naturally husky voice that sounded a little sexy and very comfortable to listen to. It is very memorable and easy to discern.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang smiled back and said vaguely: \u201cWith two people sharing an umbrella, it is easy to get wet. It\u2019s okay for us guys to get wet so you should go first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Tong looked at them for a moment and gently expressed her gratitude. As she was about to step into the rain while holding her umbrella in one hand, she suddenly turned back and said while smiling, \u201cYour relationship is very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once finished, she leisurely walked off and didn\u2019t give them the chance to refute. Those words of Wu Tong\u2019s were not said without reason. Those two, in order to prevent the other party from getting too close to Wu Tong, would often try to interrupt and sabotage the other and eventually end up forced together like today. In front of a girl that they have feelings for, they obviously didn\u2019t want to show their bad side. As a result, in Wu Tong\u2019s eyes, they became close brothers with a very deep bond.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang and Qin Xu looked at each other coldly. Humph, good relationship with him? Am I crazy?</p><br/><p>Although he cursed internally but since he had already said those words earlier, it was inevitable that they would need to share the umbrella. If Wu Tong suddenly looks back and sees that they are not walking together then it would definitely leave a bad impression.</p><br/><p>However a small foldable umbrella could not easily fit two big men underneath. The raindrops quickly slid down the curves of the umbrella and fell from the edges onto their exposed shoulders.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s right shoulder was damp from the rain so he grabbed the handle and pushed it to his direction in dissatisfaction, \u201cMy shoulder is all wet from the rain. There\u2019s so much space on your side.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang gripped tightly onto the handle unwilling to move or care about him. \u201cAre you blind? What space is there? The umbrella is only this big, if you push it my side then I will also get rained on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s face hardened with displeasure. After all, the other person is the owner of the umbrella. If he couldn\u2019t move the umbrella then he could only move himself. He did his best to squeeze closer to the middle and pressed himself up against Jiang Yang to avoid the rain falling from the edge of the umbrella.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was disgusted, \u201cStay away from me. It\u2019s hard to walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu tilted his head as he smirked, \u201cYeah, I think so too. Maybe I should go and find Wu Tong instead. There\u2019s a lot of space next to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not far ahead of them was Wu Tong\u2019s tall and slim figure as she leisurely walked in the rain.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang gritted his teeth and could only restrain himself as he cursed at the other party eight hundred times internally.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he wasn\u2019t retorting, Qin Xu felt that he had got the upper hand this time and felt a little delighted.</p><br/><p>The rain outside the umbrella poured heavily but under the umbrella was bright and sunny. Because of the close proximity of the body temperatures, it even felt a little warm.</p><br/><p>However, the mood of the two men were not good and their expressions were dark.</p><br/><p>Just as Qin Xu squeezed in even more trying to avoid his clothes getting wet from the rain and consequently invading Jiang Yang\u2019s territory, Jiang Yang unhappily raised his chin and pointed it in a particular direction, \u201cJust be content with what you have. Look at the others. \u201c</p><br/><p>Looking in that direction he saw two boys running around in the rain. One of them held an umbrella and the other constantly reached out to grab it. Pulling at the arm, tugging their clothes\u2026almost every method was used. They dodged and chased each other around and seemed to be playing quite\u2026.happily?</p><br/><p>The other students passing by couldn\u2019t help but laugh and look on at the antics of the two idiots.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu squinted. \u201cWhy do they look a little familiar\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang heard this and looked closer. He realised that it really was \u2014\u2014Huang Shao. The other party was also another boy from their class.</p><br/><p>Under the umbrella, Jiang Yang and Qin Xu suddenly looked at each other tacitly and then proceeded to quickly walk away.</p><br/><p>Those two idiots. Pretend that we don\u2019t know them.</p><br/><p>As soon as they reached the cafeteria, they unhesitatingly parted ways. As if they were afraid that the others would misunderstand that they had a good relationship, they even deliberately picked two stalls furthest away from each other so that they would not come into contact at any point. This also resulted in both of them missing out on their favourite braised fish.</p><br/><p>As they looked at the brightly red coloured fish on other students\u2019 plates and was greeted by the alluring smell, their resentment for the other deepened even further. If it wasn\u2019t for that guy wasting his time on the way here then I wouldn\u2019t have missed out on the fish!</p><br/><p>After a rather unpleasant dinner, the students then proceeded to go back to their dormitory to take a shower.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang naturally wouldn\u2019t go and look for Qin Xu so that he would fight with him again for the umbrella. He returned back on his own and couldn\u2019t care less if Qin Xu ends up soaked from the rain on his way back.</p><br/><p>As soon as he stepped into his dormitory room, Jiang Yang lowered his head to open his wet umbrella up and left it in the corner to dry. He stood back up and walked forward and was surprised to see a human figure appear in front of him. Unable to dodge in time, his face crashed against the figure and he unconsciously reach out to try and stabilise himself only to find that his hands had come into contact with firm but supple skin. The next second, a playful and provocative voice sounded above his head.</p><br/><p>\u201cDear classmate, even if you envy it, you shouldn\u2019t be so perverted.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked up and found himself looking into a pair of familiar dark eyes. Those cold and mocking eyes, apart from Qin Xu, who else could it be.</p><br/><p>In an instant, Jiang Yang felt his head hurt. He had almost forgotten, after separating the classes in second year, they had also reassigned the dormitories and he and Qin Xu now shared one room. So to say, what kind of grudge does this school have against him?!</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s face darkened and he quickly retracted his hands as if he was shocked by electricity.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu had returned back to the dormitory earlier than him and, as they were all men, there was obviously nothing to be concerned about. The weather was hot and he couldn\u2019t be bothered wearing his school shirt again after his shower so he walked around exposing his upper half while arrogantly showing off his six pack.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang who had bumped into him earlier had accidentally touched just that.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu continued to annoyingly add: \u201cIf you like it you can touch it a few more times.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang scoffed coldly: \u201cActing as if you\u2019re the only one in the world who has it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu deliberately dragged his words, \u201cOhhh\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 So to say, you have it too?\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he finished speaking, he reached out and quickly pulled at his shirt hem.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang scowled and was fortunately able to successfully guard himself against him and avoid his hands. He stared at the other party coldly.</p><br/><p>There were no hints of apology or embarrassment on Qin Xu\u2019s face. He shrugged his shoulders and laughed gently: \u201cJust kidding. It\u2019s not like I wanted to see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, he confidently turned and walked away. The remnants of his words continued to linger in the air and seemed to ridicule Jiang Yang.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang coldly glanced at Qin Xu who laid in his bed playing on his phone before heading straight to his cabinet to take out his clothes and entered the bathroom to take a shower.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu who was playing a game on his phone suddenly started humming softly. He himself also didn\u2019t know why he was humming.</p><br/><p>In fact, when they were in first year of high school, Qin Xu had a pretty good impression of Jiang Yang and wanted to get along well with him. However, he didn\u2019t expect the situation to turn bad and worsen each time they interacted. Sometimes, Qin Xu also felt that this behaviour of theirs was too childish and wanted to do something to try and save their friendship but Jiang Yang\u2019s attitude towards him was always cold. Every time Qin Xu saw that cold face of his, all his prior intentions to make up would transform into words that would anger him. After this happened several times, even Qin Xu could not be bothered to stick his hot face against his cold ass and decided to just leave things as it is.</p><br/><p>There are a total of four people sharing this dormitory room. In addition to these two incompatible enemies, there was also Huang Shao and Xiao Yuxin. The former is the school slacker, and the latter is schools top student who is constantly in the upper ranks of the year and also their class leader. Although the class leader role had not yet been decided for this year, but as someone who was class leader in first year and additionally having a good reputation in class, his position was pretty much already set.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao\u2019s personality is very outgoing and energetic. The moment he returned, the room instantly became very noisy. With a mop of wet hair, he carried his clothes and prepared to take a quick shower before heading off for evening studies.</p><br/><p>The rain outside wasn\u2019t light and had instead started to pour harder and harder and eventually become a thunderstorm. A few students who had returned late ended up being caught in this downpour and could only run back through it pitifully.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao saw this and laughed without conscience: \u201cThose idiots, so pitiful~\u201d</p><br/><p>The other three members of the dormitory silently retorted internally \u2014 To even have the nerve to mock others. Earlier, you were the one that was acting like an idiot.</p><br/><p>As if he had amnesia, Huang Shao had automatically deleted the memory of his prior antic in the rain. Instead, he expressed deep sorrow and commented sadly: \u201cWith such a heavy rain, after showering I really don\u2019t want to go for evening class.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin who sat on the edge of his bed looked down at his phone and said suddenly: \u201cDon\u2019t need to go to evening class. The teacher just said that it\u2019s cancelled because the rain is too heavy and therefore too dangerous. The power is also out at the teaching building.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, he forwarded the teachers words into the class group chat. Huang Shao suddenly cheered and rushed over to eagerly hug Xiao Yuxin, \u201cOh class leader, I love you to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin was helpless. He straightened up his clothes that had been messed up and opened his mouth planning to say something.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, the dormitory room sank into darkness.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u2026Fuck, is it a blackout?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>After two seconds of silence, Huang Shao turned on the torch function on his phone and said joyfully: \u201cI\u2019ll go shower first. When I\u2019m out let\u2019s tell some ghost stories. The atmosphere is just right, wu~~~wu~~~\u201d</p><br/><p>He deliberately dragged those sounds out and copied the background sounds from horror films as he excitedly headed out of the balcony to the bathroom. On his way there, he even nearly slipped but managed to support himself by holding onto the wall. He boasted about his good reflexes before continuing to fumble his way around.</p><br/><p>The author has something to say:Two young men sharing an umbrella pushing and shoving back and forth.</p><br/><p>School (cross-dressing man) idol looked back and smiled: \u201cAiya, these two people are really interesting~\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

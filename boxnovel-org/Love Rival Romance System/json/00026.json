After all, that is their own body and they couldn\u2019t watch the other person use their own body to do embarrassing things. Incidentally, they became the most well complimented desk partners. When the teacher asked one of them to answer a question, the other would actively whisper hints. When one falls asleep, the other would help keep a look out.</p><br/><p>They didn\u2019t talk much and waited for the end of class to find another chance to discuss things out again. However, at this moment Tang Ling Ling suddenly came over and said to Qin Xu: \u201cJiang Yang, I have something to tell you. Can you come out for a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang instantly became very vigilant. The two of them speaking alone? Qin Xu won\u2019t speak nonsense, right?</p><br/><p>His distrust for Qin Xu was a result of his constant exposure to his shameless side. He had completely forgotten that Qin Xu generally acted cold and indifferent in front of others.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang acted unconcerned and asked: \u201cWhat are you looking for him for?\u201d</p><br/><p>But Tang Ling Ling and Qin Xu almost never spoke. Hearing him suddenly ask her a question, she replied politely: \u201cNothing much.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSince it\u2019s nothing much then can\u2019t you just say it here?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment he said those words, he realised that he had probably said too much as it clearly was none of his business. On any other day, Jiang Yang naturally wouldn\u2019t care but now that it concerned himself, he wanted to be careful.</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling found this strange. She frowned and wanted to say something, but Qin Xu had already stood up and walked out first, \u201cLet\u2019s speak outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling froze for a moment before realising that he was speaking to her and proceeded to quickly follow him out. Internally, she wondered why Jiang Yang\u2019s tone to her today felt particularly cold. Despite them not being very close, they were still friends who have known each other for many years. She mulled over this and unknowingly glanced back to the classroom only to see \u201cQin Xu\u201d sending a glare of warning at \u201cJiang Yang\u201d. She became even more confused, since when did Qin Xu care so much about Jiang Yang?</p><br/><p>In the corridor, Qin Xu leaned lazily against the railing and asked: \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling hesitated for a moment before speaking up: \u201cActually, I\u2019m helping someone else ask. I just thought that your relationship with Qin Xu is good and wanted to ask if he has a girlfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu raised his eyebrows and did not answer. Instead, he focused on the wrong point, \u201cMy relationship with Qin Xu is good?</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s right. Aren\u2019t you two inseparable? Although the two of you may have had some misunderstandings in the past, everyone has recently noticed that you two have reconciled. I have always thought that you two would get along very well, just like how it was at the beginning of first year. With two school idols walking around, it naturally is a feast to the eyes.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the end, she smiled and even included a ridiculing tone.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu heard this and subconsciously nodded as he agreed with her opinion that the two had reconciled. Although he didn\u2019t want to admit it, it was true that the system contributed to this and not himself. Thinking this, he suddenly felt a little unhappy.</p><br/><p>Because Qin Xu didn\u2019t answer her question, Tang Ling Ling asked again.</p><br/><p>This time he absent-mindedly said: \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling released a sigh of relief as she finally managed to help her friend out. Patting him on his shoulder, she wanted to give her thanks but, since he wasn\u2019t actually Jiang Yang, Qin Xu subconsciously dodged her hand and left Tang Ling Ling confused.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Qin Xu saw her natural act of intimacy and couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cHe\u2026..What is my relationship with you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Tang Ling Ling was a little dumbfounded: \u201c\u2026..It\u2019s okay. We\u2019ve been classmates for many years and you are Huang Shao\u2019s friend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu very quickly concluded that they knew each other through Huang Shao. They did not normally interact with each other much and were purely just classmates. Thinking this, the corners of his lips formed a soft curve.</p><br/><p>At this moment Jiang Yang who was peeking through the window couldn\u2019t restrain himself anymore and pretended to act casual while walking over. \u201cJiang Yang, where\u2019s your English book? Let me copy your notes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he said this, his gaze fell onto the two figures. He was worried that Qin Xu would say something stupid to Tang Ling Ling.</p><br/><p>Under Tang Ling Ling\u2019s look of fascination, he dragged Qin Xu away and, seeing that there was no-one around, he whispered: \u201cWhat did you two talk about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu answered straightforwardly: \u201cShe said that our relationship is good and wanted to ask you if I have a girlfriend.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that their relationship is good, Jiang Yang was stunned and momentarily could not react. After a moment, Jiang Yang managed to grasp the main point: \u201cShe probably was helping someone else ask. If that girl came to find you, uh\u2026.I mean me, how do you want me to deal with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without even thinking about it Qin Xu responded, \u201cAct cold and ignore.\u201d</p><br/><p>The way he said this was very smooth and natural. It was obvious that he is very experienced with this.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang pouted internally and secretly complained while externally, he remained expressionless. Raising his eyebrows, he said, \u201cBeg me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that the well-being of Qin Xu\u2019s body was under his control, he could do as he pleased and generate a whole heap of mess for him to deal with once their body is returned. In addition to this, this situation was completely impossible to explain. After all, who would believe something as ridiculous as soul exchange?</p><br/><p>The expression in Jiang Yang\u2019s eyes were clearly filled with provocation. It was as if it was saying \u2014 If you don\u2019t beg me, you\u2019re done for.</p><br/><p>But who is Qin Xu? He wasn\u2019t afraid of anything and instantly pretended to act pitiful while clinging onto Jiang Yang. Revealing a pair of watery black eyes, he said simply: \u201cI\u2019m begging you, please don\u2019t mess with my body.\u201d</p><br/><p>The way he said this was very clever and could easily be misunderstood.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s face instantly darkened, and he thought internally: Fuck, I made the wrong move. It really stung his eyes seeing his own face make an expression like that.</p><br/><p>He pried away his hands with a look of frustration and demanded: \u201cStand up straight.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu continued to act like a noodle and didn\u2019t exert any strength. Instead, he leaned against him lazily and said: \u201cTired.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was completely done with him. It was his own body so how could he be willing to beat him up? He could only grit his teeth and drag that annoying bastard back into the classroom. He couldn\u2019t help but feel like he was taking care of an annoying and spoiled child.</p><br/><p>Baby Qin slowly followed behind him and snickered secretly.</p><br/><p>Soon, Jiang Yang found out who the girl who had been crushing on Qin Xu was. It was the girl who asked him about the relay race this morning. The relay race required two men and two women to participate. That girl was pretty good at sprints so she probably didn\u2019t want to confess and only wanted to be closer to Qin Xu. She probably thought that she might be able to find a chance to talk to him when they practiced for the race.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>She came over and stopped before Jiang Yang\u2019s desk and waited for his eyes to move over to her. But Jiang Yang was not actually Qin Xu and so he subconsciously glanced at his desk partner through the corner of his eyes. Qin Xu was eating Pocky biscuits while supporting his chin lazily and leaning in Jiang Yang\u2019s direction. The moment he saw her come over, he casually said: \u201cYou should participate. We could work together and get first place\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the last of his words fell, Jiang Yang kicked his chair. He was momently surprised and almost lost balance, but he soon recovered himself.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang glared at him. His eyes were saying, why should you decide for me?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu raised his eyebrows and stuffed the remaining Pocky into his mouth. He then grabbed the registration form and quickly wrote their names onto it before returning it back to the girl: \u201cWe will both participate. Now that it\u2019s all decided, you should hurry and hand it in to the sports committee. Do it before this guy changes his mind.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pointed to Jiang Yang in a joking and friendly manner. Just as Jiang Yang wanted to get up and grab the form, he was held down by him and the other end of the pocky that was in Qin Xu\u2019s mouth was broken and stuffed into his mouth. While Jiang Yang remained dazed by that move of his, he said very nonchalantly: \u201cDon\u2019t waste it~\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang snorted with dissatisfaction and coldly broke the Pocky in his mouth in half. He then proceeded to snatch the remaining Pocky on his desk over and ate it: \u201cWho said I\u2019m not eating.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu spread out his right hand and made a \u2018help yourself\u2019 gesture, \u201cPlease do as you please, elder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that he isn\u2019t going to snatch it back and even allowing him to eat it, Jiang Yang felt a little unhappy and didn\u2019t feel the sense of accomplishment that he had expected. After eating two of them, he threw the packet back at him.</p><br/><p>The girl took to registration form but despite Qin Xu clearly signing up to participate, she couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly disappointed. She looked at the four names listed on the relay table with the two newly written names at the end; Jiang Yang, Qin Xu. If Qin Xu wrote his name first, then her name would be right next to Qin Xu\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Yet\u2026\u2026.</p><br/><p>As Qin Xu\u2019s secret admirer, she is naturally familiar with his handwriting and she noticed that those words written on the registration form looked very similar. Although this shouldn\u2019t be the case, she felt very jealous. Jiang Yang could be Qin Xu\u2019s desk partner and even have such a good relationship with him. If Jiang Yang was a girl then she wouldn\u2019t even have the courage to try things out with Qin Xu.</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong>This is the sixth sense of a girl in love. She subconsciously realised that for Qin Xu, Jiang Yang is different~</p><br/>\n</div>"}

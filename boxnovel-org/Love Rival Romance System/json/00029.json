There were even warm yellow decorations in the lounge room adding warmth to the home. Quite unexpectedly, it was rather ordinary.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang changed his shoes at the entrance and looked towards the lounge room while secretly breathing a sigh of relief. He then quickly reacted, why is he surprised that it\u2019s ordinary? What did he expect, alien style?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but laugh at himself.</p><br/><p>He turned back and saw Qin Xu staring at him with interest. He asked curiously: \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang licked his lips and smiled awkwardly, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he asked: \u201cWhere are your parents?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, I forgot to tell you,\u201d Qin Xu casually shrugged. \u201cThey often work outside and sometimes wouldn\u2019t come home for a few weeks. I\u2019m usually here alone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at him with a look of surprise and frowned. He didn\u2019t expect this to be the case.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was used to it and didn\u2019t think much of it. Also, since he is now much older, it could be said that he feels more comfortable being alone. However, seeing the change in Jiang Yang\u2019s eyes, he immediately realised that he could take advantage of it.</p><br/><p>He deliberately released a depressed sigh and said glumly: That\u2019s why I suggested for you to come to my place. It\u2019s almost impossible to be exposed. My place is quiet and almost has no signs of people living here. Sometimes I would wake up at night and just find myself surrounded in darkness and silence. It feels like I was abandoned by the whole world and extremely uncomfortable\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He said this in a low and dull tone. Looking up, he pursed his lips and revealed a small smile, but his eyes still looked empty and sad. Combined with that smile, it conversely made him look even more lonely and pitiful.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang saw this and couldn\u2019t help but keep silent. He didn\u2019t know what he could do to comfort him. He hesitantly raised his hands and patted him on the shoulder before saying dryly: \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll stay with you for the next two days\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu looked down as if he was trying to conceal his grief but, in fact, he was doing his best to hold back his laughter and to hide it from Jiang Yang.</p><br/><p>He continued with a low voice: \u201cThere\u2019s something that I have always wanted to do and that\u2019s to get my ears pierced but I have no one to accompany me\u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>The sad atmosphere stiffened and the hand on his shoulder gradually curled up into a fist. Jiang Yang smiled coldly: \u201cIt was all a pretence wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu raised his teary black eyes and innocently asked, \u201cWhat do you mean a pretence? Everything I said is the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut why do I feel that you are just trying to take advantage of my sympathy?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>\u201cThen it\u2019ll have to be about something true for me to make you feel sympathy for me, I didn\u2019t make them up.\u201d Qin Xu raised his chin and looked calm. He walked into a room and then came out with a small box. Handing it over to Jiang Yang he said, \u201cThis is the earrings that I have preselected. It will definitely look good when I wear it. Take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pushed the opened box in front of him and even if he didn\u2019t want to look, he was forced to. Jiang Yang glanced at the earrings and saw a pair of black irregular geometric shaped earrings with a silver vine-like border wrapping around it. The black stud wasn\u2019t just pure black, it had small glittery spots throughout and looked almost like a starry night sky. It was very unique and dazzling.</p><br/><p>\u201cDoesn\u2019t it look good?\u201d Qin Xu excitedly shared what he liked with Jiang Yang. The moment he became excited, he also began speaking a little faster and his eyes brightened with liveliness.</p><br/><p>He said: \u201cActually, I think that earrings will also suit you. Why don\u2019t we get it pierced together? I\u2019ll help choose a nice pair for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo.\u201d Jiang Yang immediately refused.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu originally said this as part of his strategy to convince him. By establishing an even more unacceptable request, the earlier request would seem insignificant in comparison and in turn appear more acceptable. But the moment those words left his mouth, Qin Xu actually thought that it was a pretty good idea. With Jiang Yang\u2019s handsome face, when paired with a pair of earrings, it would definitely be very attractive. He suddenly had the urge to give it a try.</p><br/><p>Being stared at so intensely made Jiang Yang feel a little creeped out. Qin Xu soon realised that it was useless for him to staring at Jiang Yang since, after all, he is currently in Jiang Yang\u2019s body and only needed to look at his phone to allow him to visualise how it would look.</p><br/><p>Looking at his phone, Qin Xu touched his ears and slowly caressed it. The earlobe is soft and meaty and the and the auricle was pale and beautifully arched. The more he looked at it, the more he felt that it would definitely suit him. He then held up a pair of earrings and compared it assess how it would look.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he is sincerely thinking over it, Jiang Yang panicked. Qin Xu had always been someone who is rather impulsive and would do things without much thought or consideration. This can be both good and bad. At least this was what Jiang Yang thought. Seeing him touch his ears like that, Jiang Yang technically shouldn\u2019t feel anything. But perhaps because that body is his, he couldn\u2019t help but vague feel a slight itching sensation at his ears.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang felt extremely troubled. He pulled down his hand and said in a frustrated tone: \u201cStop touching it. I\u2019m not getting it pierced.\u201d</p><br/><p>The earrings fell and flew to the other end of the room. It made a clear and crisp sound the moment it hit the ground.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>At this moment, the two were sitting on the sofa. Qin Xu clenched his fist, looked at the earring on the floor before turning back to look at Jiang Yang with a dark expression. He stared at him until Jiang Yang felt his back go cold \u2014\u2014 As if he was a prey that had been locked onto.</p><br/><p>For a moment, everything went quiet.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu didn\u2019t go to pick up the earrings and, instead, he suddenly pushed Jiang Yang down and pressed him onto the sofa before he had the chance to retaliate. He firmly restrained Jiang Yang down and bent his face down to almost an inch of a distance away \u2013 almost to the point of kissing.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu grabbed him by his shirt collar and, despite the smile on his face, there was no evidence of it in his eyes. He lowered his voice and said in a threatening tone, \u201cXiao Yang Yang, why are you throwing away my gift for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s expression went stiff, \u201cWhat gift? Isn\u2019t that your earring?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s my favourite pair of earrings. But I just decided that I would give it to you. Tomorrow, I\u2019ll go and get it pieced.\u201d Qin Xu was positioned against the light, casting shadows over his face. It clearly looked like he wasn\u2019t joking.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang moved his lips and for moment almost let slip \u2014 I\u2019ll do it! I\u2019ll fucking get it pierced okay? So stop getting strange ideas about my body!</p><br/><p>He almost blurted that out and caved in.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu sensed his wavering thoughts through his eyes and hooked his lips upwards. He sat up and made the gesture to leave, \u201cSince it\u2019s decided, I\u2019ll go get it pierced.\u201d</p><br/><p>His actions were resolute, and it really looked like he was going to leave now and get it done. Jiang Yang instantly reacted by reaching out and holding him back by his hugging onto his waist. Perhaps because they had exchanged bodies, he felt that since it was his own body, it didn\u2019t matter if he did intimate actions like this. It wasn\u2019t like he was violating anyone.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the doorknob turned and the crisp clicking of heels could be heard. Someone entered, and a female voice rang out.</p><br/><p>The moment Mother Qin returned and looked to the sofa in the lounge room, she saw her son hugging onto a similar aged boy. She asked with a look of confusion: \u201cWhat are you two doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two instantly stiffened.</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong>Qin Xu: Couple earrings [Pouts\u2026..]</p><br/>\n</div>"}

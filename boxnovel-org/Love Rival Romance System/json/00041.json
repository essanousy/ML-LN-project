If they had time, they could even prepare themselves for tomorrows lessons. Although it is said to be used this way, most students would finish their homework and feel like they had completed a huge feat. To reward themselves, they would start reading novels or play games.</p><br/><p>Of course, Qin Xu is not one of those good students. He finished the homework that\u2019s due tomorrow and immediately decided that he was done for the day. He didn\u2019t worry about the rest of his work and started mulling over something else \u2014\u2014\u2014 stealing Jiang Yang\u2019s phone and deleting those photos.</p><br/><p>Although he is narcissistic and felt that he looked quite handsome in those photos, he felt that his amnesiac self is a bit too na\u00efve and innocent looking so it was best to avoid letting others see it.</p><br/><p>And so, while Jiang Yang is sprawled across the table catching up on his sleep, his hand quietly reached over to Jiang Yang\u2019s trouser pockets. He wanted to get a hold of Jiang Yang\u2019s phone without his knowledge but this thief-like, sneaky behaviour of his only made him feel guilty. He would constantly check Jiang Yang\u2019s face as his hands reached over and he subconsciously prepared himself to quickly retract his hands and act like nothing had happened if there were any signs of Jiang Yang waking up.</p><br/><p>The phone was in his trouser pocket and the phone owner is also in a sitting position. Like this, the phone could be said to be stuck to his leg and any movement would be easily detected. It is obviously a very difficult feat to be able to get the phone without him noticing. Qin Xu intended to start with reaching into his pocket and lifting the phone so that it would not touch Jiang Yang and then pulling it out. At this moment, he is very grateful that the school uniform is loose and that there is a lot of room for movement in the pocket.</p><br/><p>At this moment, Qin Xu had already lifted the phone and all he had left was to pull it out. When he thought that everything was going successfully, he didn\u2019t expect Jiang Yang to wake up. He already had a good grip of the phone and, when Jiang Yang suddenly moved, he was scared to the point that he had frozen up. He was afraid of Jiang Yang catching him in the act.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu stared at Jiang Yang for a long time and saw that Jiang Yang only moved a bit to make himself more comfortable before continuing to sleep. Qin Xu had not expected this movement and the hand that was inside Jiang Yang\u2019s pocket accidentally brushed up against his leg.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu naturally did not give up. With his hands all stiffened, he slowly lifted his hands up again. Seeing that Jiang Yang only continued to sleep, he became a little more courageous and started pulling the phone out. When the phone was halfway out of the pocket, Qin Xu\u2019s wrist was suddenly held onto with a tight grip. The palm of the hand made direct contact with his wrist and he could feel the heat transmitted through.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu stiffened up and awkwardly looked up to meet Jiang Yang\u2019s cold gaze.</p><br/><p>At some unknown point in time, Jiang Yang had woken up. From his arms, you could see half his face and his dark and bright eyes stared at Qin Xu. He asked slowly: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, he already knew what he was doing.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was surprised, and his heart skipped a beat. He was almost certain that this bastard was awake the whole time and was just pretending to be asleep! He even waited until he almost got the phone to grab his hand and scare him!</p><br/><p>Qin Xu continued to curse out at Jiang Yang internally but what he didn\u2019t know was that Jiang Yang had to put great effort into pretending to be asleep. He had only opened his eyes in annoyance when he felt an itch sensation coming from his thighs and saw a sneaky figure reaching into his trouser pocket.</p><br/><p>Without even needing to think about it for too long, he knew that it was Qin Xu. He originally wanted to expose him immediately, but he thought for a moment and felt that it wasn\u2019t good enough; he should wait until he is almost successful and let him feel even greater disappointment. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to pretend to be asleep. As he is very ticklish, his thigh muscles contracted many times and he did his best to stop himself from laughing whenever Qin Xu accidentally touched him.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the phone was about the be taken away, he deliberately acted nonchalant and grabbed onto Qin Xu\u2019s hand. With a pursed mouth, he looked at Qin Xu\u2019s cautious expression and felt a great sense of accomplishment.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao who was sitting behind them suddenly joined in and joked: \u201cXiao Xu Xu, you bad bad~</p><br/><p>Qin Xu who was caught red-handed quickly recovered back to his usual calm state. He wanted to retract his hand back, but Jiang Yang continued to hold onto him tightly and displayed no intention to let go. He even deliberately took away the phone with his other hand and casually pressed on it a few times. He smiled and said: \u201cQin Xu classmate, what do you want to do with my phone? Is there something you want in it? Let me take a look first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu saw him click open the photo album and Huang Shao who sat behind them stretched his neck forward to see.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu didn\u2019t want those photos of his to be exposed so he subconsciously reached out to steal the phone. Jiang Yang had already expected this, and his hand quickly avoided his and moved outside of his reach. However, Qin Xu stubbornly continued trying to reach forward and, in the process, his body ended up becoming pressed up Jiang Yang\u2019s and his lips almost touched Jiang Yang\u2019s face. It was just that he paid no attention to this close proximity.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang continued to avoid his reach while Qin Xu continued to move reach forward. With Jiang Yang leaning back even further and Qin Xu pressing on top of him, he eventually lost balance and fell. The abrasion between the chair and the floor made a harsh sound and it was followed by the sound of heavy things falling to the ground.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu pressed down onto Jiang Yang and the two fell to the ground together while still fighting for the phone.</p><br/><p>The other classmates heard the sounds and turned back to look. Huang Shao who was watching on happily reported to the audience: \u201cClass leader, I\u2019m reported these two for disrupting class. Qin Xu is pressing Jiang Yang down and still won\u2019t let go.\u201d</p><br/><p>The noise they made was loud but Xiao Yuxin who sat in front of themhad already noticed that something unusual was going on. Seeing the two rolling around the ground together, as the class leader and also as their roommate, Xiao Yuxin felt extremely helpless. He turned around in his desk and looked down at the two who were still struggling on the ground. His eyebrows shook as he said: \u201cStop fighting. You\u2019re disturbing the other students. If you don\u2019t I\u2019ll have to mark your names down.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this he thought internally; what reason should he write it for? Forcefully feeding their classmates dog food?</p><br/><p>This scene here was extremely familiar. The only difference was that Qin Xu was wearing clothes this time.</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin who knows such a big secret but could not share it with anyone else expresses that he is really tired. You two, control yourselves! If you want to do something, wait until you\u2019re back in the dormitory and roll around in the sheets there. Of course, the premise is that you don\u2019t disrupt my sleep. You will not be able to find a roommate as caring as me!</p><br/><p>Xiao Yuxin looked at them seriously and did his best to maintain an air of authority appropriate for a class leader. Jiang Yang and Qin Xu naturally didn\u2019t want to make their good friend lose face. They glanced at Xiao Yuxin, smiled a little and then glared at each other before reluctantly getting up and returning to their seats. As if nothing had happened, they pretentiously looked through their textbooks.</p><br/><p>Less than two minutes of silence later, the bell signalling the end of class rang. Good, now Jiang Yang and Qin Xu can boldly scuffle with each other for the phone. The other students got up and proceeded to return to their rooms and, in an instant, the classroom became very rowdy like a farmers\u2019 market.</p><br/><p>***</p><br/><p>In the end, Xiao Yuxin did not know what happened between Jiang Yang and Qin Xu\u2019s fight for the phone, but he could tell that their relationship had improved significantly.</p><br/><p>On another day, there was still one more lesson left until morning classes were over.</p><br/><p>During class, Huang Shao waved his phone around excitedly saying that he heard from a student from a different class that a good barbeque shop opened up nearby. He asked if everyone wanted to give it a try and they could make a group order.</p><br/><p>There were many different options available at the school cafeteria but after eating it day in and day out, it was inevitable that you would get sick of it. It wasn\u2019t a bad idea to change things up a little. The boys naturally joined in and a couple of girls who were close with the boys like Tang Ling Ling also made their orders.</p><br/><p>Everyone huddled up and looked through the menu on the phone before ordering what they wanted.</p><br/><p>For convenience, it was all done on one phone. It would allow them to save on delivery feels and also get maximum amount of points. Huang Shao asked them what they wanted to eat and marked it down on his phone.</p><br/><p>When he asked the next girl, she was still undecided, so he proceeded to skip her and move on to the next person.</p><br/><p>\u201cXu brother, what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>The moment Huang Shao said those words, the female student quietly looked in Qin Xu\u2019s direction and bit her lip unconsciously. She appeared to care greatly about what he wanted to eat.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was busy playing on his phone. He didn\u2019t look up and just said casually: \u201cI\u2019ll have whatever Jiang Yang\u2019s having.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao made a noise of acknowledgement and remembered that these two had similar tastes. His finger then moved to add another order of roasted duck and pork ribs.</p><br/><p>The female classmate saw this and whispered: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to get, I\u2019ll get that too then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao was surprised: \u201cDouble order? Can you finish it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The quantity of a double order is quite large, and the price is also 1.5x more expensive. A girl would normally not be able to finish it.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao said this, and the female student was a little stunned. She looked a little embarrassed as she bit her lower lip. She was a little at loss and couldn\u2019t help but feel a little regret and some defiance.</p><br/><p>At this moment Tang Ling Ling spoke up, \u201cHuang Shao, why do you care so much? We\u2019re going to share it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao saw her look and finally understood. He smiled and said indifferently, \u201cI just didn\u2019t want you to waste it. Remember to find me if you can\u2019t finish~\u201d</p><br/><p>After finalising the order, the students did not disperse and continued to gather together to chat.</p><br/><p>The female student who just ordered couldn\u2019t help but glance at Qin Xu and ask: \u201cThat, Qin Xu, you wear glasses?\u201d</p><br/><p>The students around her heard her ask this and looked in Qin Xu\u2019s direction.</p><br/><p>With a handsome side profile, sharp and cold eyebrows that looked like the sharp edges of a sword, a pair of black and gold rimmed glasses rested on his tall nose. It made him look extremely fashionable while also covering up some of the coldness in his eyes. Despite clearly only playing on his phone, the warm sunlight shone through the window panes and lit up his face making him appear even more dazzling and handsome.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao looked over and smiled: \u201cIt\u2019s just a small amount. Xu brother doesn\u2019t normally use it. He would only wear it when he wants to be a little pretentious.\u201d</p><br/><p>The female student mumbled: \u201cLooks very intellectual.\u201d</p><br/><p>She actually wanted to say that it looks very good, but she was too embarrassed to say it directly.</p><br/><p>The female student didn\u2019t say it loudly but the others around her were close enough to hear her. The moment she said those words, someone else sneered.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang ridiculed: \u201cWhat intellectual? You must mean an intellectual scum right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu who was paying attention to the game on his phone finally looked up. He directed his smile at his desk partner and deliberately used his finger to pretentiously push his glasses up, \u201cXiao Yang Yang, don\u2019t you know that intellectual scum is actually a complimentary term? You use this to refer to someone who is extremely proper and elegant to the point that they are just too charming. It\u2019s rare for you to praise me like that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao and the other students: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d What a bunch of nonsense.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Of course, this wasn\u2019t because of Huang Shao. What was about going to happen, will happen.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was treated coldly by Jiang Yang for no reason for two whole days. Despite asking him why, he wouldn\u2019t answer so he naturally couldn\u2019t hold himself back anymore and exploded.</p><br/><p>At this moment, it was convenient that the two of them are desk partners. Qin Xu sat next to him so even if he wanted to hide, it was difficult for him. Jiang Yang had tried to suggest to the teacher the idea of changing seats, but it was Jiang Yang himself who had proposed the idea of them sitting together in the first place so, with this sudden change, the teacher couldn\u2019t help but be concerned. He asked Jiang Yang if they had a fight. He naturally couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to it and wanted to mediate.</p><br/><p>How should Jiang Yang explain? Can he say \u2014\u2013 Oh, it\u2019s because I suddenly found out that Qin Xu likes me and I\u2019m still not sure whether or not I feel the same for him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m gay so I\u2019m deliberately avoiding him.</p><br/><p>Of course, he can\u2019t say that.</p><br/><p>And so, when asked this by the teacher, Jiang Yang randomly made up a reason that didn\u2019t suffice for his reason to change seats and his request was naturally unsuccessful.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang tried to find a classmate to change seats privately. It was normal for students to change seats for a class or two so that they could sit with their friends to play games and the like.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s reason was also quite good. He asked Huang Shao\u2019s desk partner to change seats for a class so that he and Huang Shao could play games. The male classmate also didn\u2019t find anything wrong with it as he was familiar with how game-crazed Huang Shao is.</p><br/><p>When the class bell rang, Qin Xu saw a male classmate walk over holding his textbook and sit next to him. His expression immediately became unsightly. Through gritted teeth he asked, \u201cDid Jiang Yang ask to change seats with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The boy who was glared at felt his back go cold, \u201cYeah\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu\u2019s expression darkened another shade.</p><br/><p>The boy then recalled Qin Xu\u2019s bad reputation and his tendency to be involved in fights. As a good student who had only concentrated on studying, he suddenly felt afraid.</p><br/><p>Although Qin Xu was angry, he wouldn\u2019t vent it on another person. He did his best to maintain a calm expression as he said faintly: \u201cDo not change. You go call him back. Tell him I have something to say to him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The male student who had become a little slow to realise what was going on after all the studying that he had done finally realised that something was wrong. He quickly packed up his things and ran back to his seat to pass on Qin Xu\u2019s words.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang who sat in the seat originally looking down while playing his phone suddenly stiffened. His head moved slightly as if he wanted to turn to look at Qin Xu, but he quickly stopped himself. He looked up at the male student and could tell that he no longer wanted to change seats. He could only cooperate by standing up and move back to his seat.</p><br/><p>Under Qin Xu\u2019s burning and watchful gaze, Jiang Yang slowly sat down. He could then hear him ask almost in an interrogating manner, \u201cJiang Yang, what do you mean by this? Can\u2019t you just say it to me directly if you have any problems? Do you really have to avoid me like this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang heard his angry tone and suddenly wanted to laugh. If it was something that could be clarified so easily, then why would he go through all that trouble?</p><br/><p>Qin Xu felt very wronged. He looked straight at Jiang Yang unblinkingly waiting for his response.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at his straightforward and frank gaze and felt a little envious of his ability to express his thoughts so easily. He seriously thought about it for a moment. After the appearance of the system, Qin Xu had slowly changed over time and it was only after he noticed his feelings that he left behind lots of clues. Although he didn\u2019t know when Qin Xu had started liking him, he was certain that it must have been for a while hence his clingy nature. But why could Qin Xu accept it so quickly after finding out that he liked another boy? Shouldn\u2019t he similarly go through a stage of shock and denial?</p><br/><p>But on the contrary, Qin Xu responded very calmly and accepted it very quickly. Could he have originally been bent? No, he liked Wu Tong before\u2026..wait, isn\u2019t Wu Tong originally a man?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t just him, even he had secretly liked Wu Tong before.</p><br/><p>Since young, the first person he had developed a good feeling towards had turned out to be a cross-dressing master, a well and truly man. Could it be\u2026\u2026.that he was actually a closeted gay?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was shocked by this idea that suddenly appeared in his mind and, for a moment, he couldn\u2019t accept it. Thinking that his sexual orientation had suddenly changed after more than a decade, Jiang Yang felt extremely complicated inside.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu watched Jiang Yang\u2019s expression change around a few times, but Jiang Yang continued to remain silent and didn\u2019t pay him any attention. Qin Xu felt his mood worsen and he no longer wanted to be ignored. He suddenly grabbed Jiang Yang\u2019s wrist to attract his attention, \u201cHey, Jiang Yang you\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Jiang Yang\u2019s reaction was very big. He very roughly threw off his and his ears even inexplicably turned red. He himself didn\u2019t notice that change and Qin Xu, who was too surprised by his strong rejection, also didn\u2019t notice it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang retracted his hand as if he was just shocked by electricity. Met with Qin Xu\u2019s look of confusion, he was a little at loss. His mouth opened and closed as he seemingly had a lot to say but he also didn\u2019t know what to say. He swallowed the words back down and said drily, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You\u2019re overthinking it.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Qin Xu be placated so easily? All the emotions that he had accumulated over the past few days had filled his heart and, like a firecracker that was lit, it was immediately set off.</p><br/><p>How could he not notice Jiang Yang\u2019s acts to hide from him? The moment he was angered, Qin Xu couldn\u2019t control himself. He felt extremely angered and also very wronged. He angrily patted on the desk and said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking too much?! You\u2019re clearly evading me! Do you think I\u2019m blind?!\u201d</p><br/><p>His sudden outburst attracted the attention from the whole class. Seeing that Qin Xu\u2019s expression didn\u2019t seem right as he confronted Jiang Yang, they could tell that things weren\u2019t good. Didn\u2019t these two big brothers already reconcile? After not quarrelling for so long, why did they\u2026\u2026..Huh? Wait. What did Qin Xu say earlier? Why did it sound like a wife\u2019s grievances towards her husband? It\u2019s just my imagination, right? Right?</p><br/><p>The air around them became quiet.</p><br/><p>The classmates were stunned. They instantly started imagining all sorts of things and their expressions were a little complicated.</p><br/><p>The nature of their conflict this time was obviously different from before. Jiang Yang was faced with both Qin Xu\u2019s accusation and the watchful eyes from the onlooking classmates. He suddenly felt both awkward and ashamed. With a hint of panic, he pressed Qin Xu\u2019s head down to block his line of sight and deliberately said calmly: \u201cIt\u2019s nothing. You guys continue with your studies. We won\u2019t disturb you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The classmates hesitantly turned back but they were obviously still a little curious, so they would occasionally glance back a few times.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu looked back up with look of reluctance. Jiang Yang said to him in a small voice, \u201cClass is starting. Don\u2019t make trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu looked at him with a pair of dark, shiny eyes and insisted: \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had clearly wanted to deal with this coldly so that his and Qin Xu\u2019s relationship could slowly return back to those of normal classmates but, like this, Jiang Yang was at loss of what to do.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince you\u2019re not saying the reason then that means that there\u2019s nothing wrong, so you shouldn\u2019t hide from me.\u201d Qin Xu said this with clear intent to reach some sort of resolution.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang was a little frustrated. He scratched his head and thought about it before opening his mouth: \u201cDo you still remember the system?\u201d</p><br/><p>Light flashed through Qin Xu\u2019s eyes as he seemingly thought of something and he felt a little guilty. Jiang Yang however was doing his best to organise his thoughts, so he didn\u2019t notice it. He continued: \u201cIt\u2019s original intention was for us to become friends. We are friends. Friends. Understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu was stunned for a moment. Hearing him saying something in a not-so straightforward manner, he was in daze for a while before he could finally react. Jiang Yang had deliberately placed an emphasis on the word \u2018friend\u2019 and had repeated it twice. Qin Xu fell silent for a while as he seemingly realised something. The light in his eyes gradually dimmed and his face fell.</p><br/><p>He looked down and said with his long lashes blocking the emotions in his eyes: \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had originally thought that he would need to explain for a long time, but he saw Qin Xu suddenly quiet down and turn back to work on his homework dejectedly. In any case, he no longer looked over at Jiang Yang anymore.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026..\u201d Jiang Yang hesitantly reached out and patted his shoulder, \u201cYou really understand?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu let out a sound of affirmation. When he saw Jiang Yang still looking over at him, he turned around and said grimly: \u201cIf you ask again, I won\u2019t be able to guarantee that I won\u2019t bother you. Didn\u2019t you want me to leave you alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026\u2026 That\u2019s true but\u2026..</p><br/><p>Being looked at by Qin Xu like that, Jiang Yang felt a little guilty. It was as if he had just done something wrong. As for Qin Xu, he inexplicably looked like a large dog that was abandoned by its owner. With drooping ears and a pitiful whine, he looked very pitiful.</p><br/><p>He felt even more guilty seeing this.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang silently retracted his hand. He no longer said anything, and he also proceeded to look down to work on his homework.</p><br/><p>And thus, this strange atmosphere was maintained.</p><br/><p>When they had lunch, they didn\u2019t sit together like they had usually. When Qin Xu walked over with his plate of food, despite there clearly being a vacant seat next to Jiang Yang, he deliberately acted like he didn\u2019t see it and moved to sit at another seat further down. He started eating without a word with a gloomy expression.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao saw this and leaned over to Jiang Yang who sat in front of him. With his hand covering his mouth he whispered: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with Qin Xu these days? Why is his expression so bad? Is he heartbroken?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang\u2019s hands that held onto his chopsticks stalled for a moment before he continued to pick up a piece of meat to eat with a look of calmness.</p><br/><p>Usually, when someone around them isn\u2019t acting right, their friends would start joking around and speak nonsense. They obviously didn\u2019t know that he was heartbroken and was just randomly guessing but sometimes they can accidentally guess the truth.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao ate his lunch and couldn\u2019t help but add: \u201cDid you guys have another fight? You should go and talk it out. Xiao Yang Yang, you are too proud. If you continue acting like this, you\u2019ll be disadvantaged. You clearly didn\u2019t mean it that way and you know that you would regret it later so why bother? We\u2019re also about to be in our third year so there\u2019s not much time for us to be together. Make sure you don\u2019t regret it later.\u201d</p><br/><p>He persuaded Jiang Yang very sincerely as a friend and Jiang Yang naturally could hear his concern.</p><br/><p>It was just that the situation this time was special, and it wasn\u2019t convenient telling Huang Shao. Jiang Yang could only think to himself and process those words himself. He then pulled at the corner of his lips and smiled softly, \u201cIt\u2019s not a fight. We\u2019re friends. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang who had explained it with this sentence received a WeChat message from Qin Xu the same night. It was just one sentence.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho\u2019s your friend. I\u2019m not your friend.\u201d</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong>Qin Xu little child: So angry. Who\u2019s your friend?! I don\u2019t want it!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

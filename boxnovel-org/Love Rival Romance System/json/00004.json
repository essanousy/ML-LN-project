He constantly thought back to Jiang Yang\u2019s strange behaviour of covering him with a blanket. Was he worried about him? Concerned? Did he want to be friends again?</p><br/><p>But very quickly, these guesses of his were dismissed. After all, Jiang Yang continued to act extremely unconcerned about him and every time they met his expression would be filled with hatred and disgust.</p><br/><p>With these nonsensical thoughts sloshing around in his mind, by the time he got a little sleepy, it was already morning. After about half an hour, the morning bell rang. As the others got up, Qin Xu turned over, buried his head into his blankets and continued to sleep.</p><br/><p>The result of not sleeping well for a night was a blue-green patch under his eyes. With a dark expression, he walked into the classroom.</p><br/><p>At the entrance he encountered Xie Zhe who had just returned from filling his water bottle. He jokingly asked: \u201cXu brother, what did you do last night? You look like you had too much fun. That\u2019s right, I also helped you fill up your bottle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhe held up two bottles and shook them.</p><br/><p>Qin Xu had not yet recovered from his bad morning mood and didn\u2019t want to talk. His dark eyes looked as if they were shrouded in ice as he coldly nodded his head and turned to walk into the classroom.</p><br/><p>Passing by the blackboard, Huang Shao was twisting his ass and very excitedly playing around with the other students. Seeing someone pass by him, he offhandedly slapped that person on the ass and hollered passionately: \u201cMorning baby!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu halted his steps, turned and half squinted his extremely cold eyes as it locked onto Huang Shao. With no expression on his face and along with his stern demeanour, his actions appeared even more cold, and his gaze piercingly sharp.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to die?\u201d The cold, hoarse voice was filled with suffocating tension.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao who had played with death instantly realised that he had accidentally slapped a tigers butt and raised his hand surrendering, \u201cSorry Xu brother. I really didn\u2019t realise that it was you. I-I thought I was slapping little fatty\u2019s ass.\u201d</p><br/><p>In an instant the warzone spread and Qin Xu\u2019s eyes moved to the pale fatty who stood next to him. The moment his eyes met Qin Xu\u2019s terrifying gaze, he was terrified to the point of shrinking his neck and had the urge to bury his head like an ostrich.</p><br/><p>The white fatty glared at Huang Shao and internally accused him of lacking in loyalty. To think that he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to drag innocent people down with him!</p><br/><p>Luckily Qin Xu had seemingly returned back to his senses and only kicked Huang Shao before turning to head back to his seat.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao hugged his leg and licked his dry lips: \u201cI thought I was going to ascend to heaven just then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Little fatty felt no sympathy for him and just watched him holding his leg jumping around, \u201cI think you mean going to hell.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao aggressively rushed forward and grabbed onto little fatty, \u201cLook at you cursing me. I dare you to say it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Once again, they started messing around.</p><br/><p>They only slowly returned to their seats when the class bell rang. Huang Shao and Jiang Yang shared the same table. He sat on the inside so in order to get in, Jiang Yang would need to stand up to make way. Huang Shao is the classic example of a scar that had forgotten his past pain. Seeing Jiang Yang stand up to make way, he once again felt the urge and slapped Jiang Yang\u2019s ass before very cheerily shouting out: \u201cYoohoo~\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you looking for death?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang reacted by pushing him in aggressively causing Huang Shao to fall into his chair and bang his elbow against the corner of the table sending a strong current of numbness and pain up him arm. He held his arms and moaned, \u201cHey\u2014\u2013that hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang very nonchalantly replied: \u201cKarma.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao wiped away his crocodile tears and wailed: \u201cXiao Yang Yang, you weren\u2019t like this in the past. You\u2019ve changed. You\u2019ve become so heartless now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked at him disgusted. It was as if the longer he looked at him, the more likely his eyes would go blind. \u201cThat\u2019s enough. Don\u2019t call me with such a disgusting name.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao immediately clutched his heart: \u201cHow can I do that? This is my nickname for you to demonstrate my love~\u201d</p><br/><p>He half covered his face and acted shy while blinking his eyes.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang threw a hard slap across his face and told him to get lost otherwise he would beat him up.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao and Jiang Yang had known enough other for many years and he was very clear about his bad temper. Playing around with him and teasing him before reaching the bottom line was okay but once he truly angered him he would be mercilessly beaten black and blue, regardless of their friendship. As such, Huang Shao instantly reverted into an exaggeratedly obedient expression and even reluctantly pulled out the language textbook from his pile of books before proceeding to quietly mutter something.</p><br/><p>\u201cTwo are so similar. Could they actually be long lost brothers?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang glanced over and Huang Shao was started. He instantly shook his head in denial, \u201cNothing. I didn\u2019t say anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang continued to stare at him for a while until Huang Shao felt the hair on his back stand, before he slowly turned back and looked back down at his workbook.</p><br/><p>Not knowing if it was his imagination, Huang Shao listened to him reciting phrases and inexplicably felt like there was a bit of tension in them. Huang Shao breathed a sigh of relief while cursing internally: What pair of school idols? I think it\u2019s more like double devils!\u201d</p><br/><p>Once the morning reading session was over, the students were not allowed to take a break and immediately started attacking their homework.</p><br/><p>Due to last night\u2019s heavy rain, the temporary cancellation of the evening class brought a moment of happiness but the aftereffects of it was very obvious. The homework left by the teacher would naturally not be cancelled because of the rain so it was still due but the due date had been postponed until noon today. Naturally, they would need to find time to work on it, or copy it.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang had already completed the science homework and had the more troublesome English and language homework left. Luckily, he had already had a prior agreement with Xiao Yuxin to borrow his homework. This was the benefit of sharing the same room with the top student.</p><br/><p>Xia Yuxin loves to learn. Even during class time, other than water breaks, he would almost always be stuck to his table and either be doing after-school exercises to consolidate his knowledge from todays\u2019 class, or preparing for the next class. It could be said that he is the classic example of a good student.</p><br/><p>Therefore, even with the temporary cancellation of the evening class, he did not have the same burden of having to complete his homework last minute as he had already finished his homework during class yesterday.</p><br/><p>The top students\u2019 homework is naturally very popular and already had a lot of requests for it. His work would be passed around like vines; once Jiang Yang finishes copying he would lend it to Huang Shao and Xiao Yuxin would lend it to the next classmate.</p><br/><p>As Jiang Yang rushed through the homework quickly copying down the answers, a couple of knocks were heard on his desk. He distractedly glanced over only to see slender fingers with distinct bone outlines forming a gesture to get his attention.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang subconsciously thought that it was the classmate next in line pushing him to hurry up and said without raising his head: \u201cWait, almost done.\u201d</p><br/><p>Less than two seconds later, the other party once again knocked on the table.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked up irritably, \u201cCan\u2019t you be a little more patient? It\u2019s not like I can suddenly finish with you chasing me up like this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as his final words fell, he unexpectedly found himself looking directly at Qin Xu\u2019s handsome face and he instantly reacted to this by changing his expression into a frown, \u201cThe next one is you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu raised the corners of his mouth but there was no sign of smile in his eyes. \u201cWhat next? I\u2019m asking you to make way. Your box is blocking my path.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked down and saw that his box holding his books were placed on the floor beside his table and the student next to him also happened to have his box on the floor as well. With these two large boxes sitting next to each other, the path just happened to be obstructed with no place for others to set their foot down.</p><br/><p>It was indeed their fault but seeing the other party\u2019s almost provocative expression, Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but feel annoyed. Obviously, he didn\u2019t back down and apologise.</p><br/><p>If it was someone else then he would have just moved the box aside but since it is Qin Xu, he couldn\u2019t help but want to start something with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re too old to lift up those jade legs of yours to step over them? Do you even need me to teach you something as simple as that? Or do you want me to carry you over?\u201d</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong>In the face of his provocation, Qin Xu happily replied: \u201cThat\u2019s good, you should carry me over~\u201dJiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Suddenly I have an urge to hit him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

The third years were busy getting ready for their college entrance examination and still had classes on the weekends. They only get two days off each month.</p><br/><p>Some of the students couldn\u2019t help but express: \u201cNext year, it\u2019s our turn. So unfortunate.\u201d</p><br/><p>Other classmates would comment: \u201cWhat are you afraid of? You could just mix in with the first and second years and slip out. If you\u2019re brave enough, you can have a break every day~\u201d</p><br/><p>They would then laugh and continue to head downstairs.</p><br/><p>Most of the students in this high school lived in the same city and wasn\u2019t too far from home. They would choose to go back by bicycle which is both a convenient and chic form of transportation. A group of good friends would band together to form a team and ride down the road with their uniforms billowing with the wind. From time to time they would laugh and chat with the people around them. People who saw them couldn\u2019t help but feel nostalgic as they recall the times when they were also like this in their youth.</p><br/><p>Leaving the school gates, Jiang Yang rode on his bicycle enjoying the breeze. Soon, Huang Shao caught up from behind. He chucked while saying: \u201cXiao Yang Yang, is this shirt washed by Xu brother? Tell me the truth, what happened between you two? Why is he willing to help you wash your clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes were filled with anticipation for gossip.</p><br/><p>However Jiang Yang who heard his words only reacted indifferently. He fake laughed a few times: \u201cYou want to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao nodded his head vigorously.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201cIt\u2019s actually very simple. If you let me beat you up then I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that he would be beaten, Huang Shao shuddered and retracted his neck, \u201cXu brother provoked you again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Again. That word was used very well. The fact that it was said without a thought demonstrated how their bad relationship had become deeply rooted in the hearts of onlookers. The reason why Jiang Yang is not in a good mood, without even needing to think, nine times out of ten would be because of Qin Xu. This was the same for Qin Xu.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang coldly snorted and didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao wanted to probe further but was interrupted by Xiao Yuxin who suddenly appeared out of nowhere and purposely rammed into him with the front of his bicycle. Huang Shao was confused but Xiao Yuxin turned to Jiang Yang and gave him a look of understanding.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d As I said, what on earth do you understand?!</p><br/><p>After Xiao Yuxin accidentally witnessed that scene last night, Jiang Yang couldn\u2019t help but notice the terrifying changes in his eyes. Understanding, appeasement, encouragement and\u2026\u2026sympathy?</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang who didn\u2019t even know where to start explaining things felt even more frustrated.</p><br/><p>After separating from Xiao Yuxin who took a different turn, they continued to ride their bicycles bypassing streets and turning corners. Huang Shao smelt something very aromatic, squinted and rushed ahead to a street stall before turning back and waving his hands, \u201cThere\u2019s octopus balls here. Do you want it?\u201d</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Jiang Yang showed an impatient expression and didn\u2019t respond. He still, however, rode over to the stand and stopped to ask the boss for a box.</p><br/><p>The boss responded quickly and turned over the octopus balls on the stove with skilful movements. The fried octopus balls were then one by one poked and neatly arranged in the carton and toppings were added in the order of sauce, dressing, seaweed powder and bonito flakes. The freshly made octopus balls were golden and fragrant, and the skin was both crisp and tender. It truly enticed the hungry high school students\u2019 stomachs.</p><br/><p>Once it was done, the boss even helpfully gave them two sticks and handed the box over. Naturally, they had already paid for it with the QR code. Like others, the moment Jiang Yang took his box he rested on his bicycle and proceeded to eat by the side of the stall. From the side a stick reached in and bravely took hold of one of his octopus balls.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang turned around to find himself face to face with Huang Shao\u2019s mischievous face that had no hint of guilt. He felt a little speechless: \u201cIt\u2019s not like you don\u2019t have any yourself. Does it taste better when you take it from others?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao extended his thumb up, \u201cBingo! Do you want to try mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Facing the carton that was enthusiastically pushed in front of him, Jiang Yang rolled his eyes and took one.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao wailed: \u201cThat was my biggest one! I wanted to eat that one last!\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang heartlessly laughed: \u201cThen I must be lucky. These were all made using the same mould, your eyes must be very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao complained: \u201cThere were a lot of sauce and seaweed on it~\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang: \u201cI\u2019ll give you one?\u201d</p><br/><p>Huang Shao\u2019s eyes lit up as he passionately nodded his head.</p><br/><p>When the stick reached over, Jiang Yang agilely dodged and shoved the last one into his mouth. He then shook the empty box in his hand. Despite not saying anything, his expression and his actions were very infuriating.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao: \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d He nearly cried!</p><br/><p>Happily finishing off the octopus balls, they rode forward for a while to a local convenience store and bought two cans of chilled coke. Standing by the door, they pulled the tab and drank it.</p><br/><p>A bicycle flashed across the road from them. It was red-gold and very eye-catching. Huang Shao was originally admiring how handsome and how expensive the bicycle is when he realised that the owner of it looked very familiar \u2013 \u201cXu brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Qin Xu who had almost reached the next intersection thought he heard his name and stopped with on foot on the ground. He looked back and very quickly his line of sight found their location.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked on with no expression on his face. Just like the flowers and plants by the road, he didn\u2019t plan to send him his greetings.</p><br/><p>He thought that Qin Xu would also do the same and just turn and leave on his bicycle but, surprisingly, he didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>The moment the young man on the bicycle turned to looked at them, his eyes brightened and, without any hesitation, he waved with a bright smile. His mouth opened and closed as if he was saying something. The warm orange sunset behind him casted a faint warm glow over him softening his looks like caramel melting in the sun. With this kind of effect, his smile looked even more dazzling.</p><div><div></div></div><br/><p>Jiang Yang saw this and his heart suddenly skipped a beat. A strong but strange emotion rose inside him and, as if he had just fallen into a hot spring, his chest felt warm and bubbly. It also felt like he was trapped inside a small space and the emotions that formed inside him continued to swell in his chest making him feel uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>These complicated emotions mixed together and finally formed the emotion of irritation. Grasping tightly onto the can of coke, he soon heard the sound of metal crushing and black liquid flowed out over his hands.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao who saw Qin Xu smiling brightly at them thought he saw wrong. He quickly looked around and searched for the presence of the school idol Qu Tong but it was to no avail. Shocked, he complained internally \u2013 That\u2019s impossible. The school idol isn\u2019t even here so why is the iceberg-like Xu brother suddenly smiling? Who is he smiling at?</p><br/><p>Before he was able to figure out the reason, Huang Shao saw Jiang Yang next to him crushing the can in his hands and looking like he was about to explode in anger. Huang Shao instantly closed his mouth and became as quiet as a chicken.</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang is sudden angry? Who provoked him?</p><br/><p>Just as he thought this, Huang Shao immediately remembered Qin Xu\u2019s radiant smile. That\u2019s right, those two are like fire and water. Jiang Yang obviously wouldn\u2019t take the time to appreciate his smile. On the contrary, if he is well then Jiang Yang would not be happy.</p><br/><p>Huang Shao who believed that he finally understood what was going on spoke up: \u201cCalm down Xiao Yang Yang. You spilled your coke, what a waste.\u201d</p><br/><p>Jiang Yang looked down, frowned and then turned back to head back into the convenience store. He threw the crushed can into the bin before buying a packet of tissues and used it to clean his hands. From the beginning to the end, he didn\u2019t say a word. The atmosphere around him even made the young female clerk scared to the point of not making a sound as she was afraid that he would suddenly lash out. However, she didn\u2019t expect to see him go out again and clean up the coke on the floor before leaving on his bicycle.</p><br/><p><strong>The author has something to say:</strong>It is an exclusive skill to be able to make Jiang Yang explode with one touch. Only Qin Xu can make him be so concerned~</p><br/><p>&lt;&gt; &lt;&gt; &lt;Chapter 17&gt;</p><hr class=\"wp-block-separator\"/><figure class=\"wp-block-image is-resized\"></figure><br/><p><strong>KK has something to say:</strong>Despite being so productive last week, this week I\u2019ve noticed myself slacking off\u2026.. Too tired to translate after getting home from work + the chapters are getting longer. The one I\u2019m doing now is 4x the usual length! Hopefully I don\u2019t end up running out of chapters to post &gt;&lt; (So far I still have &gt;15 chapters translated so it should be okay\u2026.)</p><br/><p>Next chapter, Jiang Yang gets issued with a new task!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

So Zhang Shang had some impression of this name.</p><br/><p>When Gao Xun heard this, he was stunned for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat is the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said they\u2019re in Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion?\u201d</p><br/><p>Due to his astonishment, he jumped up from the ground, attracting the gazes of many people around him.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang put his hands behind his head and gave him a strange look. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know them?\u201d</p><br/><p>After Gao Xun calmed down, he sat back down beside him. It was unknown whether he was shocked or not, but he did not say a word for a long time.</p><br/><p>To him, it was indeed a big blow.</p><br/><p>Before he joined army, he mentioned it to Xie Zhen, and soon he was in the army.</p><br/><p>After that, he was unable to contact the outside world for a long time. When he returned, he found out that the Xie family had moved out of Qing Zhou.</p><br/><p>He had asked around the Xie family and found out that Xie Liqing had returned to the capital to report on his duty. He didn\u2019t know when they would return.</p><br/><p>At that time, Gao Xun suffered a blow, and his entire life went dark.</p><br/><p>His best friend had left without a word, and never came back.</p><br/><p>This time, it was his favorite little girl. Now that she had left without a word, would she still come back?</p><br/><p>In general, it only needed about three months to go to the capital to report on his duty only needed. Gao Xun waited in Qing Zhou for three months, but they didn\u2019t come back.</p><br/><p>He had thought about it. Since she wouldn\u2019t return, he would come to the capital to find her.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t found her yet, but she turned out to be the Fifth Miss of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion?</p><br/><p>The Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion was an influential family in the capital. In the past, Duke Dingguo\u2019s grandfather, Xie Xin, had gone through life and death with the late Emperor Yuan Zong, and was loyal to him. Emperor Yuan Zong finally retrieved the territory of Da Jing, and Xie Xin could be called the meritorious statesman.</p><br/><p>Dozens of years had passed since then, and although the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion was not as grand as it used to be, it was still an unreachable one.</p><br/><p>Back then in Qing Zhou, he had never heard her mention it.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun sat in a daze.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang pushed his arm, making him come to his sense. \u201cWhat the hell\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun wiped his face and smiled bitterly. \u201cIt\u2019s a long story.\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Zhong Shang was not interested in this matter, but from his reaction, it seemed that he had some inside information.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang raised his eyebrows and grinned meaningfully. \u201cOh?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLove story?\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought that Gao Xun would deny it, but not to think that he would remain silent for such a long time. Such a reaction\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang asked in surprise, \u201cIt\u2019s true?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve liked her since I was seven years old,\u201d Gao Xun admitted.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s been almost ten years.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang was surprised, Xie Liqing\u2019s eldest daughter Xie Zhen has married, could he be talking about the youngest daughter Xie Xun?</p><br/><p>How old is Xie Xun this year? Is she ten years old?</p><br/><p>Could it be that this kid was a pedophile?</p><br/><p>Gao Xun, who didn\u2019t know what he had thought, said with his memory. \u201cWhen I first met her, I thought she was a fairy who had fallen from the sky.\u201d</p><br/><p>He tried everything to attract her attention, but only Li Yu was in her eyes. Only after Li Yu left did he have a better chance of getting close to her \u2026</p><br/><p>Even so, she\u2019d treated him like a playmate when he was young, and she\u2019d never given him any other feeling.</p><br/><p>He did not give up, feeling that he would definitely be able to move her. However, he never expected that she would be as heartless as Li Yu. She actually left without saying goodbye.</p><br/><p>\u201cI came to capital for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang touched his chins. \u201cDo you really want to see her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun quickly asked, \u201cDo you have a way?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was true that he had a way. His father had some connections with the Duke Dingguo, so it wouldn\u2019t be difficult for him to make a trip to Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>It was hard to let him meet Xie Xun \u2026</p><br/><p>After some thought, Zhong Shang asked again, \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s Second Master Xie\u2019s daughter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun nodded. \u201cShe also has a brother called Xie Rong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then it might be Xie Xun.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang had a whole new level of respect for Gao Xun. Before the girl had grown up, he had already set his eyes on her. If her parents found out, wouldn\u2019t they have broken his legs?</p><br/><p>In order to help his brother, Zhong Shang decided to visit the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion first.</p><br/><p>Although his father was on good terms with the Duke Dingguo, he had never been to the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion before.</p><br/><p>In the past, he had been busy shouting, eating and playing, but now he was busy strengthening his body and practicing martial arts.</p><br/><p>In the army, he was ruled by the General of Agile Cavalry. He was like a monk, who had not been out for several months.</p><br/><p>This time, it was because of Zhong Shang\u2019s grandmother\u2019s birthday celebration that he was able to make a trip out.</p><br/><p>After the old lady of the general\u2019s estate had finished her birthday banquet, he came to visit the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion the next day.</p><br/><p>After Duke Dingguo heard it was this devil, he thought for a long time, but he still couldn\u2019t figure out why he had come.</p><br/><p>Not daring to be negligent, he hurriedly got someone to invite him into the central room.</p><br/><p>When Zhong Shang came, he prepared a stalk of Lucid Ganoderma as a greeting gift. The Duke Dingguo was flattered and had thought that this kid was here to cause trouble, but he didn\u2019t expect to misjudge him.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang was honest, and said in a very normal manner, \u201cBefore I heard that Duke Dingguo\u2019s health was not as good as before, you were my father\u2019s respected teacher. He has been too busy with military affairs to spare any time, so I came to see you on his behalf.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Duke Dingguo had a gracious heart toward Zhong Kai, and Zhong Kai was a loyal person. Even after so many years, he still wouldn\u2019t forget his graciousness.</p><br/><p>Xie Wenguang sighed with emotion, \u201cMilitary affairs are more important. Even if he doesn\u2019t come, I won\u2019t blame him.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them sat and chatted for a while. Zhong Shang was a juniors who were good at talking. He chatted with this senior for a long time without realizing it, and they talked for almost an hour.</p><br/><p>During this time, Zhong Shang had inadvertently asked about Xie Liqing, but Xie Wenguang said that Xie Liqing had been called to the palace early in the morning and hadn\u2019t returned yet.</p><br/><p>After sitting for a while, Zhong Shang asked, \u201cI wonder if I can go to the mansion for a stroll?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Duke Dingguo thought he felt boring, so answered with agreement, \u201cI was the one who didn\u2019t give you a proper welcome.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome, I\u2019ll take you for a walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion occupied a wide area. It was quite a distance from the front yard to the backyard. There were many exotic flowers and plants growing in the backyard. Now, it was autumn, and flowers were still blooming everywhere.</p><br/><p>As he walked and watched, Zhong Shang was busy talking to the Duke Dingguo. Even so, he could still see the two people sitting on the shore.</p><br/><p>The two of them propped up a big foot-stool and a small foot-stool on the shore. The little girl sat next to the youth, holding a fishing rod in her hands. From time to time, she would turn her head to look at the youth, but once seeing that he didn\u2019t catch the fish, she would be discouraged.</p><br/><p>Zhong Zhong had a premonition. He asked the Duke Dingguo, \u201cThose two are\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Duke Dingguo looked over and recognized the girl and youth at a glance, \u201cIt\u2019s my grandson and daughter, the eldest is called Xie Rong, the youngest is called Xie Xun.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he led him over.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang didn\u2019t expect it would be so easy to meet the girl. He studied Xie Xun\u2019s back for a moment. It was a little one.</p><br/><p>As he got closer, he could hear her and Xie Rong\u2019s conversation: \u201cBig brother, can we catch a fish today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong sat calmly and replied, \u201cPerhaps.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to eat fish!\u201d she said happily.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong said, \u201cI\u2019ll give it to you if I catch it.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had a craving look on her face as she counted the names of the dishes one by one, \u201cI want to eat sweet and sour fish, braised fish and fish stew!\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice was childlike, and she was still a child.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang frowned slightly. Why did Gao Xun like this little fellow?</p><br/><p>It was obviously a gluttonous girl, how was it like Little Fairy?</p><br/><p>Duke Dingguo called out to them, and they both turned around.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang could see her face clearly now, a little older than he had expected, but not much more than twelve or thirteen years old.</p><br/><p>She was small and delicate, with delicate eyebrows, snow-white skin and a round, apple-like face.</p><br/><p>She pointed to the lake and said, \u201cGrandfather, my brother and I are fishing!\u201d</p><br/><p>Duke Dingguo laughed. He was somewhat fond of the children of Second Branch. \u201cHow many did you catch?\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked at the empty bamboo basket on the floor and shyly said, \u201cNot a single one \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Duke Dingguo encouraged her to work harder, and introduced Zhong Shang to them. \u201cThis is eldest son of the General of Agile Cavalry, Zhong Shang, who currently holds the post of a garrison in the army.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Rong, you two are about the same age.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong nodded slightly in greeting.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was a little afraid of strangers, so she didn\u2019t call him for a long time.</p><br/><p>Duke Dingguo did not force the two of them and let them go on fishing, and he and Zhong Shang went elsewhere for a walk.</p><br/><p>When they left, Zhong Shang turned around to take another look, only to find that the little girl had just caught a lotus leaf. Her expression changed from surprise to disappointment, and all of this only took a split-second.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang grinned. This was a child.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun felt that Zhong Shang was something wrong with the way when Zhong Shang was looking at him these days.</p><br/><p>As for what was wrong, he couldn\u2019t say.</p><br/><p>It seemed to contain all sorts of meanings \u2026</p><br/><p>He finally could not help but say, \u201cIf you have something to say, just say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang said frankly, \u201cI heard that Miss Xie will go to the Babao building tomorrow to buy snacks. If you want to see her, I can help you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun was clear about the way Zhong Shang did things. \u201cHow can you help me?\u201d he asked uneasily.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t destroy her reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang smiled, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>The next day Xie Xun got into the carriage and led the biddies and servant maids to the Babao building.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun wanted to buy a few snacks for Xie Zhen, since the sister has been married, she has become more boring at home alone.</p><br/><p>Since her brother wouldn\u2019t play with her, she had no choice but to find her own entertainment. To her knowledge, eating was the best kind of entertainment.</p><br/><p>The carriage stopped in front of the Babao building. She let the two servant maids go in and bought jujube paste sponge cake and rose cake while she waited in the carriage.</p><br/><p>After a while, the servant maids returned with nothing in her hands.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun sat up and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s the snacks?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, someone knocked on the wall twice. She opened the door and saw a face that was both familiar and unfamiliar.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun thought for a long time, but she couldn\u2019t figure out who he was.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang smiled at her. He was a ruffian, so he raised the food box in his hand and went straight to the point: \u201cWant the snacks?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCome with me to meet someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun had no recollection of him. She drew back. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, the two of them had met a few days ago, so Zhong Shang didn\u2019t expect her to forget about him so quickly. After some thought, he reintroduced himself, \u201cZhong Shang, we met when you were fishing at home.\u201d</p><br/><p>He put the box on the horse and turned to her. \u201cDo you know Gao Xun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you a friend of brother Gao Xun?\u201d Xie Xun said in surprise.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang thought, all right, this must be the right person Gao Xun wanted.</p><br/><p>It must be the childhood sweetheart that Gao Xun had mentioned.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

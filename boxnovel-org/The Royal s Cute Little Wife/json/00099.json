Adding to that, his father was the Grand Secretariat to the current head of the Cabinet, so if the two families could get married, that would be for the best.</p><br/><p>It was just that they did not know how Xie Xun thought about it.</p><br/><p>Although the marriage needed the parents\u2019 orders and the matchmaker\u2019s words, both of them hoped for the happiness of their children. Therefore, they respected the views of their children more in matters of marriage, unlike the other families. Once, Madam Leng called Xie Xun into the house and asked indirectly, \u201cAre you on good terms with Grand Secretariat Gu\u2019s daughter, Gu Ruyi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun nodded without thinking, \u201cSister Gu treats me very well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng made an \u201coh\u201d sound, then turned and asked: \u201cYou have been to Grand Secretariat\u2019s mansion a few times, have you seen her brothers and sisters?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun heard her talking to Xie Liqing a few days ago and immediately guessed what she wanted to ask. Xie Xun lowered his head and stared at the Begonia Silk Embroidered Shoes at his feet, and stammered, \u201cNo \u2026 \u201cNever seen him before.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, her tone was too guilty, Madam Leng could tell that she was lying immediately.</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>She thought about it, shook her head, then nodded, \u201cI\u2019ve seen Sister Gu\u2019s two younger sisters \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>had indeed only seen Gu Ruyi\u2019s sister, and had never seen Gu Yi before. The reason she felt guilty was because of that \u2026 It was because she suddenly remembered that Gu Ruyi had asked Gu Yi to draw a picture of her. The color of the bamboo was evergreen and it was hung around her room as a decoration.</p><br/><p>She was afraid that after Madam Leng found out about this, she would be even more committed to bringing her and Gu Yi together.</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t prepared at all \u2026</p><br/><p>Madam Leng touched her head and suddenly asked: \u201cDid you hear what I said to your father last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was stunned, she raised her head and asked hesitantly, \u201cHow do I know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, Madam Leng was only guessing, but her performance was so obvious, which further confirmed Madam Leng\u2019s thoughts. Madam Leng\u2019s lips curled up into a smile, as if she was an obedient daughter. \u201cThat day, Senior Servant Lu came to the main house to deliver the dumplings, saying that you were the one who had personally wrapped them. I thought that if you did it personally, you would definitely have brought it here personally \u2026 But you weren\u2019t there. I asked Lu mama and she said you left early. This is the only reason why Mother thinks so much. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun bit her lips and did not say a word.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not satisfied with Eldest Young Master Gu?\u201d Madam Leng said gently.</p><br/><p>She shook her head, \u201cNo\u2026 I just don\u2019t know what kind of person he is. \u201d Pausing, she said listlessly, \u201cI can\u2019t bear to part with my mother and father.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Madam Leng smiled, \u201cDo you think this mother can bear to part with you? Your sis has only just married someone, if you were to marry someone else, there wouldn\u2019t even be someone by my side who would be able to talk to me. \u201d</p><br/><p>She told her that she was only going to choose a good marriage for her. As for when she would get married \u2026 He definitely had to wait for her at her fifteenth birthday.</p><br/><p>She calmed down.</p><br/><p>The Madam Leng also talked about how great Young Master Gu was. He was a talented man, and there were many girls in the capital who secretly admired him. He also said that this person was humble and gentle, warm as jade, how good was that? was a little curious about this person, and did not reject him as much as before.</p><br/><p>Under Madam Leng\u2019s words, Xie Xun obediently mentioned that Gu Yi had asked her to draw for her. Until now, he had not taken back that painting.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng did not think for nothing the entire night, she immediately said to her: \u201cTomorrow, Ronger will go to Grand Secretariat\u2019s mansion to pay respects to Young Master Gu, and bring the painting back for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he said that he wanted Xie Rong to take the painting, there was actually another important reason. That was to let Xie Rong see this person\u2019s personal character and character, and whether or not he was truly as perfect as the rumors said.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun went out very early in the morning.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong did not bring many people with him, but brought two servants with him, riding on horses to the Grand Secretariat\u2019s mansion. After informing servant of his purpose at the door, he went in to report and quickly returned to invite him in.</p><br/><p>Gu Yi lived in a courtyard in the southwest side of Grand Secretariat\u2019s mansion. Outside of the pavilion, there was a patch of bamboo. The wind blew through the bamboo forest, causing the leaves to rustle. Xie Rong was not very familiar with this place. He had met Gu Yi a few times before, but they had never gotten to know each other well.</p><br/><p>servant led him through the bamboo forest, and indicated to the inside: \u201cMy young master is inside. Thank you young master.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong took two steps forward, and saw a figure under the tree in front of him. He had his back to him and was dressed in a moon-white garland of lotus flowers. There was a jade guqin in front of him and his fingers were placed on the strings. Slowly, a melodious melody flowed out. Xie Rong, who was standing behind Gu Yi and listening to his melody, walked forward and said, \u201cAfter reaching the level of proficiency in literature, your zither arts are also excellent.\u201d</p><br/><p>He stood up and looked behind him, meeting Xie Rong\u2019s pair of eyes that were as calm as water, and said with a smile: \u201cSo it\u2019s Yongchang, I didn\u2019t know you were coming to visit me, I didn\u2019t welcome you from afar, didn\u2019t welcome you from afar.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he hurriedly invited servant to pour some tea and invited Xie Rong to sit behind the square table in front of him.</p><br/><p>Gu Yi was indeed as rumored, elegant, gentle, and without any airs. He sat across from Xie Rong and personally poured a cup of tea for him. \u201cI was just excited, so I casually played a song and made you laugh.\u201d The tea broth flowed out from the spout of the pot, and the aroma of the tea assaulted his nostrils.</p><br/><p>Although the two of them did not have much to do with each other, they could still exchange a few words. Gu Yi\u2019s personality was the complete opposite of Xie Rong. He had a easy-going personality and was able to speak a few words to anyone, whereas Xie Rong rarely spoke, and rarely took the initiative to speak with him. Two equally handsome and elegant young masters were sitting under a tree. One of them was smiling while the other was silent. If a chessboard was placed in the middle of the two, it would give them a sense of beauty.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong did not forget what the Madam Leng had told him. After speaking for a while, he asked, \u201cMy sister said that you drew a Bamboo Cloud Evergreen Map for her. She asked me to take it back for her. \u201d</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t said it, Gu Yi would have forgotten.</p><br/><p>He had finished completing the painting, but no one came to retrieve it. He gradually forgot that if it wasn\u2019t for Xie Rong\u2019s visit today, it would probably still be in his study. Gu Yi sent servant to the study room to retrieve the painting, and said humbly, \u201cThere are some flaws in the painting, I hope your sister won\u2019t be offended by it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong smiled and said that he wouldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the servant returned with a troubled expression and said, \u201cYoung Master \u2026 This little one found it according to what you said, but was unable to find it. \u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yi frowned slightly. \u201cYou didn\u2019t find the wrong place?\u201d</p><br/><p>servant was unsure, \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Why should I?</p><br/><p>Gu Yi could not explain the situation to him, so she got up and followed him to the study room. She got up and apologized to Xie Rong, \u201cI will have to trouble you to wait here for a while, Yongchang.\u201d</p><br/><p>After Gu Yi left, Xie Rong sat down beside the tree.</p><br/><p>He poured another cup and was about to drink it when someone tapped on his shoulder from behind and said with a smile, \u201cBig brother is once again lazy and doesn\u2019t want to read. Be careful, I might go tell Abba and have him punish you with three articles!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he put down the cup and turned around, the person behind him suddenly froze.</p><br/><p>Gu Ruyi originally came to find Gu Yi, it was not an urgent matter, she just wanted to borrow a few books from him. He had a lot of books here, and many of them were solo books that could not be found by the common folk. She would usually borrow any book she wanted to read from him. Today, as soon as she entered the courtyard, she saw a person sitting under a tree. She could only see the figure of a person sitting under a tree, and her eyes could only see the figure of a person sitting under a tree, and could only see a person sitting under a tree, and could only see a person sitting under a tree. When she put her hand on his shoulder and waited for a response, she knew something was wrong.</p><br/><p>Sure enough, he slowly turned his head, revealing a side face as cold as jade. Behind him was a lush wutong tree and a heptachord, it should have been a gentle and lovable picture scroll, but it was forcefully forced back by his elegant and cold bearing, turning into a scene separated by a mountain and a river.</p><br/><p>He turned his head and his eyes fell on her unstoppable smile. \u201cBrother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Ruyi stiffly retracted his hand, and retracted the smile, \u201cSo it\u2019s Young Master Xie \u2026 I thought you were my big brother, don\u2019t take offense to your actions. \u201d</p><br/><p>She quickly returned to her usual state, returning to the graceful and graceful Lady Gu in front of her. Her smile was just right on the corner of her lips, but when her eyes met his, they shifted away in embarrassment. She had the servant maids behind her bring her a veil and put it on right in front of his face to hide half of his face and also the birthmark under his eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong didn\u2019t say anything when he saw her actions, and calmly waited for Gu Yi to return.</p><br/><p>The two of them did not speak, and it was very quiet for a moment.</p><br/><p>As the host, Gu Ruyi naturally had to act as the host. He hesitated for a moment before asking, \u201cThank you, young master, for coming to find my brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong nodded his head, \u201cSince the day before yesterday, Zhan Zi had given him a painting as a gift, and then went to the study to retrieve it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Ruyi immediately understood which painting it was and she was the one who asked for it for Xie Xun. had never come to take it since a while ago and she thought that they would not want it.</p><br/><p>She also wanted to go to the study, but if she left, he would be the only one left. But she stayed behind. She didn\u2019t know what to say, so when she talked to Xie Rong, although he would answer her, he couldn\u2019t finish her words. Seeing that the tea in the pot was gone, she got servant maids to boil a fresh pot of tea, and also asked Xie Rong: \u201cThank you, Young Noble, why did you come here to pick up the painting today?\u201d</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cMy mother told me to come.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you like painting too?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot too bad.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to find an opportunity to thank Young Master Xie for what happened last time\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to you \u2026\u201d She was referring to the night before the Chinese New Year when she was taken lightly by the drunkards.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong\u2019s lower his eyes, was still the same calm and indifferent tone: \u201cIt\u2019s just a small matter, not worth mentioning.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The conversation could not go on, just as Gu Ruyi could not take it anymore and wanted to escape halfway, Gu Yi finally returned from the study. In his hand was a long box, he walked to Xie Rong and took out a scroll painting and slowly opened it, \u201cI\u2019ve finally found it, thank you young master for taking a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>The green bamboo in the painting slowly appeared in front of his eyes. It was like a pearl swaying in the wind, bent by the wind, only leaving behind the rustling of the leaves. Separated by the painting, one could almost hear the rustling of bamboo leaves. It was vivid and lifelike, causing one to exclaim in admiration.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

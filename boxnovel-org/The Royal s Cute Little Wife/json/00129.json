Xie Xun relaxed and took a deep breath. Her red eyes stared at Zhong Shang with a questioning look.</p><br/><p>This was the first time Zhong Shang expressed his love to this girl. He blurted this out just now in order to coax her into a corner. Even so, he still hugged her tightly and refused to let go.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun blinked her eyes and stopped crying. She was silent for a moment and then said angrily: \u201cLiar!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang stiffened as he let go of her. He cupped her small face that was the size of a palm and asked, \u201cHow did I lie?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was true that he liked her, but it was true that he wanted her. He had never liked a woman so much before!</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was lower than him, her height had just reached his chest, and he had to bend in order to be on the same level as her. But he didn\u2019t mind bending down in front of her. As long as she was happy, he would do whatever she wanted.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun\u2019s pink lips flattened, her voice still carried a hint of soft crying tone, \u201csis said that you\u2019re not sincere to me, you\u2019re just trying to trick me, to bully me, that\u2019s all.\u201d After she finished speaking, she lowered her head to wipe her tears, and then raised her head again, only leaving a stubborn look in her eyes, \u201cI\u2019m not easy to deceive, and also not easy to bully. Big brother Zhong Shang don\u2019t look for me, look for someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang choked, his breath stuck in his throat, unable to go down! What was her family talking about? When did he want to play with her? The only thing that hung on her body was the fact that he almost dug it out for her to see! Did she always think so of him? No wonder she was so resistant every time he kissed her.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang finally knew where the reason came from. There were many misunderstandings between them, if he did not make things clear, he would never be able to get his hands on a wife in this life.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s rough fingers touched her tears and he told her earnestly: \u201cIf Big Brother Zhong Shang doesn\u2019t want to find anyone, he likes you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun looked up in surprise.</p><br/><p>He held her hand and led her inside the house to the Arhat Bed. He untied the Talisman and placed it on her palm. Ah Xun, I came back to marry you. I truly and sincerely like you, what about you? \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun did not accept it, and stared at her own palm in a daze, \u201cWhat about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He caressed the side of her face, his voice as gentle as it ever was, like the coaxing tail of a wolf. \u201cDo you like me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun only felt that the thing in her hands was a thousand kilograms. Since it was already given to him, why did he still return it? She shook her head like a rattle. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he placed the items on the red lacquer table, turned around, and was about to leave.</p><br/><p>Big sister Ruyi couldn\u2019t find her, so she must have gone back to ask Amma. She had to go back quickly!</p><br/><p>But before she had taken two steps, Zhong Shang hugged her from behind, and rested his chin on her shoulder, \u201cWhat do you mean you don\u2019t know? You can say it, and I\u2019ll tell you. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026. How could anyone do that!</p><br/><p>Xie Xun wanted to pry his hand away, but as a martial artist who had fought on the battlefield before, the strength of his hand was not something a little girl like her could compare to. She bit her lips in frustration and scolded softly, \u201cBig brother Zhong Shang is a coward.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, this naughty rabbit was not a threat at all. Hearing this, his heart softened. He did not expect that the little white rabbit would scold him. He grinned and said, \u201cIs that all?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun thought about it, \u201c\u2026 Dirty. \u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t angry at all. On the contrary, he was addicted to listening to her scolding. He was even willing to be scolded by her. \u201cWhat else?\u201d</p><br/><p>She gritted her teeth, \u201cShameless!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang subconsciously touched his face. Still here, not afraid. He took hold of her shoulder and turned her around to face him, grinning mischievously.</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun\u2019s face flushed red.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she was about to get angry from embarrassment, Zhong Shang immediately raised his hands in surrender, \u201cAlright, alright, I won\u2019t say it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He also knew that he couldn\u2019t stay with her for too long. If he kept staying here for too long, it would arouse suspicion. However, in the end, he couldn\u2019t bear to leave her. In the end, he clasped her shoulders and said solemnly: \u201cAh Xun, I want to marry you. You just wait for me, don\u2019t get too close to Gu Yi. \u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to marry her, but did her mother agree? Mother never liked him.</p><br/><p>As if he could see through her thoughts, Zhong Shang patted her on the head and said, \u201cBig Brother Zhong Shang will definitely have a way.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

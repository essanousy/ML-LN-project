Even if she did, it wouldn\u2019t help. She spent a few days in the house, thinking, but she couldn\u2019t think of a better way.</p><br/><p>She thought that if she went to ask help of Duke Dingguo, he would definitely help them.</p><br/><p>However, this was not a long-term plan, not to mention that there was the old lady standing in the middle of it. It would not be easy.</p><br/><p>She remembered that she had accumulated a lot of precious jewelry and pearls in Qing Zhou. Some were gifted to her during the holidays by others, and some were given to her by Gao Xun on a whim. Anyway, most of them were useless. If she pawned them, she would get a lot of money.</p><br/><p>With this thought, she immediately jumped off the bed and began to rummage through her things.</p><br/><p>These things were scattered, and had not been tidied up since returning to the capital. It took Xie Zhen two hours to sort out a small box of jewellery.</p><br/><p>Even though the box was small, the items inside were extremely valuable. A single Jade Beaded Golden Peacock hairpin with three pearls embedded in it was definitely worth a lot of money.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not wear them often, because they were too expensive. It\u2019s better to be pawn them to support family.</p><br/><p>She called Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan in. \u201cTomorrow you\u2019ll take these things out to the street and find a pawnshop. Pawn them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu was confused. She opened the box and became surprise. \u201cWhy did the girl want to pawn these jewels?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never worn one. \u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t think much of it. These were only the tip of the iceberg. She still had a lot of them left in her trunk. Her top priority right now was to lighten up the burden on her family.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s in the way here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu took out an emerald fish jade hairpin, feeling it was a little familiar, \u201cIsn\u2019t this a gift from the Gao Family\u2019s young master for your twelfth birthday?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen touched her cheek, and made a gesture of being quiet. Though she knew no one was going to be there, she still didn\u2019t want to be heard. \u201cKeep your voice down.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, she also felt a bit guilty. She heard that Gao Xun stole his mother\u2019s private money in order to buy this hairpin and was then fiercely taught a lesson by Madam zhao.</p><br/><p>Actually, she rather liked this hairpin as well, but the jade on it was so bright that it was almost green. With just a glance, she knew that she could sell it for a good price \u2026</p><br/><p>She struggled in her heart for a moment before silently taking the hairpin back. She then took out a jade lantern earrings. \u201cThen I won\u2019t pawn this. Don\u2019t tell him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu chuckled. \u201cMiss should still care about Young Master Gao in your heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe\u2019s a good companion to me. Of course I care about him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course, she was well aware of Gao Xun\u2019s thoughts, but she couldn\u2019t respond to him. She could only treat him as a good friend.</p><br/><p>After Shuang Yu left, she sat in her room for a while, bored, then took a new silk handkerchief and began to embroider.</p><br/><p>Around evening, the two returned from the street with a sandalwood box in their arms. One of them followed behind the other and sneaked into the room.</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen saw this, she thought they had just returned from being thieves, but she suddenly asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you guys?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu came to her in two or three steps and pushed the box into her arms. \u201cOpen it, girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen opened the box and opened her mouth when she looking in, stunned by a wad of silver notes inside.</p><br/><p>She abruptly closed her eyes. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve given you, can it be worth so much money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if she didn\u2019t have a strong sense of money, she knew that this amount was a bit too much.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu shook her head and replied in the end, \u201cWhen we got to the pawnshop, a man wanted to buy all the jewels, and he offered her a price much higher than anywhere else.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said that if you have anything you want to be in the future, you can just go and find him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was quite surprised and didn\u2019t believe that such a good thing could happen. \u201cWho is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did he buy my jewelry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yan replied, \u201cI heard that it was bought for his wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen got relieved, no longer imagining things, she happily held the box in her arms, \u201cI want to give this money to father and mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was an impetuous person and could not wait any longer. She put on her embroidered shoes and ran to the main house.</p><br/><p>She pushed open the door and happily called out, \u201cMother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng, who was taking a nap while leaning against her make-up pillow, was awakened by her earth-shattering sound. She slowly sat up and pursed her temples. \u201cWhy are you so happy?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was late summer, and the afternoon was hot and stuffy. Madam Leng was wearing thin clothes, and only a thin blouse made of leno covered her body, revealing her graceful figure.</p><br/><p>Most of Xie Zhen looked like her, white and pretty, with long legs and thin waist and a full chest.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, it seemed to be a long time since Xie Zhen cried out for her chest pain.</p><br/><p>She quickly walked in front of Madam Leng and took out the box, as if she was offering a treasure. \u201cMother, mother will give this to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she impatiently opened the box.</p><br/><p>After Madam Leng saw what was inside, she wasn\u2019t as surprised as she had expected. Instead, her expression turned serious. \u201d Little Lamb, where did you get this money from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said the truth. \u201cI\u2019ve pawned some of my jewellery.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was afraid that Madam Leng would be angry, so she lowered her head and honestly said, \u201cI accidentally overheard your conversation with father \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to help you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice trailed off as she nervously picked at the rose pattern on her dress. \u201cI don\u2019t need those jewels anyway.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf big brother wants to take a wife, I can take out all the jewelries.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng\u2019s most successful way to educate the three children was to teach them how to love each other and how to be together.</p><br/><p>No children of any family was as affectionate as they are.</p><br/><p>Although there would occasionally be quarrels, it was only a small matter. After a while, it would return to normal.</p><br/><p>Like now, for his brother\u2019s sake, Xie Zhen can take out all the pretty jewellery.</p><br/><p>After all, she had always been the most beautiful person since she was young.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng\u2019s heart was filled with hundreds of emotions. She took her into her arms. \u201d Little Lamb, take it easy. Your father is just unlucky for a while and won\u2019t be always like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about your brother. \u201d</p><br/><p>She blinked and replied with a slight \u201cEn\u201d. \u201cThen, will you accept this money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng rubbed her head. \u201cTake it back. If we really have no other choice, can you give it back to Mother?\u201d</p><br/><p>She grinned and said cheerfully, \u201cOK!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she got back to her room, she put the sandalwood box at the bottom of the box.</p><br/><p>No matter what, the mother did not refuse her, she still had the ability to help her parents.</p><br/><p>A few days after that, Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan left the house several times.</p><br/><p>The last time they met the man who had bought Xie Zhen\u2019s jewellery, he said his wife liked it and asked if they had anything else to pawn.</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen knew it, she found out all the jewels she didn\u2019t need. They were all first-class and exquisite, and she kept a few of her favorite things.</p><br/><p>She put the money into the bottom of the box, and was surprised at the huge amount she had counted.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu added, \u201cGirl, the man said his wife didn\u2019t sleep well at night, and asked if you could do anything about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was vigilant, \u201cWhy did he ask me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu replied, \u201cHe saw this servant going to buy spice today. The spice has a sleeping aid component.\u201d</p><br/><p>She made a sound and pondered for a moment. After all, he had helped her quite a bit and he had a wife. There shouldn\u2019t be any problems \u2026</p><br/><p>Thus, she took out the scented sachet hanging on her bed, and for safety reasons, she even picked off all the patterns on it and handed it to Shuang Yu, \u201cGive him this, and let him hang it on the bed. His wife will probably sleep better.\u201d</p><br/><p>The spice inside was her own, and, like the scent on her handkerchief, it helped her sleep.</p><br/><p>When she did not sleep well at night, she used this to help her sleep. It was very effective.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu agreed, and the next time they met, she handed it to him.</p><br/><p>After a few times, they got a little bit familiar with each other.</p><br/><p>That day, Shuang Yu reported to her, \u201cMy girl, the man said that his wife had slept soundly, using your incense, and he was very grateful to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen sat on the couch by the window, smiling and blowing the wind. \u201cThat\u2019s good, I have a lot here, and if his wife\u2019s spice runs out, I\u2019ll send him more next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>She never doubted that. After half a month, she sew the spice into the scented sachet. By making five or six, she had Shuang Yu sent them to the man.</p><br/><p>A few days later, Shuang Yu told her with great gusto, \u201cGirl, the man said his wife wanted to see you and thanked you in person.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe asks if you are free the day after tomorrow, they want to ask you to meet them at the Cuiying attic in the south of the city. \u201d</p><br/><p>It was a hot summer day, so Xie Zhen liked to sit under the tree in the yard and catch a cold. The servant maids on both sides of her were blowing, so she leaned against the bed and dozed off. It was very comfortable.</p><br/><p>Hearing Shuang Yu\u2019s words, the sleepiness that had just accumulated vanished. She opened her misty eyes and asked, \u201d Cuiying attic?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Cuiying attic was one of the most famous teahouses in the capital. It was heard that the crown prince was resting here and complimenting the tea there, then it became famous for it.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu nodded. \u201cHis surname is Tao, and his wife is the Madam Ling.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t know whether to go or not.</p><br/><p>Since the other party\u2019s wife was going as well, there shouldn\u2019t be any gossips. She hesitated for a moment, and just happened to thank them for buying her jewelry. She nodded and said, \u201cTell them that I will be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>The day after tomorrow, in the morning, Xie Zhen had changed into a white silk robe and a yellow skirt, a light cardigan over his head, and a hairpin with a brocade on her head.</p><br/><p>She brought along two servant maids and two servants. Before leaving, she told Madam Leng about it. Madam Leng was still worried, so she asked Xie Rong to accompany her.</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen got to Cuiying attic in the south town, she got out of the carriage. She wore a curtain hat and smiled at Xie Rong, saying, \u201cBrother is waiting for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the horse, Xie Rong told her, \u201cIf there\u2019s something you need help with, get the servant maids to inform me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded and followed Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan inside.</p><br/><p>Hearing that the Tao couple was in a private room on the second floor, they stopped at the door. Shuang Yu knocked twice, and a servant maid in a white dress opened the door and said to them, \u201cMy family\u2019s young master and young madam are not here yet. Miss, please wait inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>She invited them in.</p><br/><p>Behind the little screen of red sandalwood in the private room was a small piece of red paint. There were several plates of dim sum and a pot of tea on it. Xie Zhen sat down, and kept waiting after asking about their young madam.</p><br/><p>In a short moment, the young servant maid in a white dress retreated, leaving only her and Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan in the room.</p><br/><p>At first, Xie Zhen was waiting quietly. But after a while, she got a little worried as he still didn\u2019t show up.</p><br/><p>Waiting was the best way to see a person\u2019s true appearance.</p><br/><p>If he had a bad temper or was not patient, he would be fidgeting and stamping his feet.</p><br/><p>But she was different.</p><br/><p>Even if she was a little anxious from waiting, she would not ask the servant maids to urge them. Instead, she sat behind a table and poured herself a cup of tea, sipping it slowly.</p><br/><p>When she had finished her tea, she took off her curtain hat, revealing an exquisite and flawless face. She rested her chin on her hands and looked around the room.</p><br/><p>She was sitting closest to the door, a clever little girl.</p><br/><p>Inside the private room, there were twelve screens embroidered with bamboo and green. The screens were made of translucent muslin, and the people behind could see the inside of the room, but the people inside could not see the decorations behind.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao sat in a rosewood chair with a scented sachet she had personally embroidered on his waist. He put his hand in his mouth and smiled as he watched her every move.</p><br/><p>Even her servant maids were getting impatient. They looked towards the door and asked, \u201cMiss, do you want this servant to go ask \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She thought for a moment. \u201cGo on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu came back in a short time. She was a little bit sad. \u201cShe said the Tao couple were late on the road. I\u2019m afraid it will take a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was afraid that Xie Rong would be impatient, so she let Shuang Yan go down and tell Xie Rong, \u201cYou tell brother I\u2019m fine, but I won\u2019t be back until a while later.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yan responded and walked out of the private room.</p><br/><p>After another incense stick of time had passed, Xie Zhen got up and walked around the room to look at the furnishings.</p><br/><p>She walked to the screen, and touched the pattern on it. Just as she was about to enter, the servant maid pushed open the door and said with a slightly apologetic tone, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry. My Young Master and Young Madam had an emergency at home, so I\u2019m afraid they won\u2019t be able to come as promised.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen turned around, dazed for a moment, then quickly smiled magnanimously. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, then we can only meet again another day.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant maid sent them out. In order to show her guilt, she even packed a few snacks for her.</p><br/><p>After they left, Yan Tao walked out from behind the screen.</p><br/><p>He stood at the window and looked down at the coach of Xie Family, which Xie Zhen got into and soon disappeared from sight.</p><br/><p>After a long time, he said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect the Xie Family to hide such a beautiful young lady.\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Kuan stood behind him, \u201cWhat does Your Highness plan to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Tao smiled and looked away, \u201cTake it slow. Don\u2019t make her scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>He already knew who she was, so he wasn\u2019t in a hurry.</p><br/><p>He suddenly thought of something and asked, \u201cWhat about the matter that I asked you to investigate last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since she was the fifth girl in the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, why did she pawn her jewellery?</p><br/><p>Did she not live well in the mansion?</p><br/><p>Yan Tao specifically asked Liang Kuan to investigate this matter.</p><br/><p>Liang Kuan replied, \u201cXie Liqing returned to capital at the end of last year to state his position, but was not used by His Majesty. He has been staying at home for the past few months.\u201d</p><br/><p>Add to that the awkwardness of his position in Xie Family, and their life doesn\u2019t seem to be going well. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Tao asked, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t he being reused?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of official position did he previously hold in the Qing Zhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Kuan said, \u201cPrefect of Qing Zhou\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe was extremely capable. He managed Qing Zhou well and it was becoming more and more prosperous.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHowever, when governor Lin impeached his relationship with the Turks when he was the prefect of Qing Zhou , His Majesty was not at ease and temporarily left him at home to check on the situation. After a period of time, he would make plans.\u201d</p><br/><p>So that was the reason. Yan Tao thought of something, \u201cWhat Lin Rui said is true?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liang Kuan shook his head. \u201cYour subordinate asked someone to investigate. Xie Liqing and Mister Lin had a feud in Qing Zhou. As for whether his words were true or false \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cStill need to check.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Rui was narrow-minded and easily held a grudge, but he was also a pain in the ass and knew how to please the people above. It was probably because of that flowery mouth that made the Emperor Yuan Hui believe his words.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing was an honest man, so he naturally couldn\u2019t win against him.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao knew the reason, so he wiped the dust on the windowsill and slowly said, \u201cPay attention to Lin Rui\u2019s actions, and find a chance to grab onto his weakness \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs for Xie Liqing, he\u2019s a talented man. It\u2019d be better if we didn\u2019t bury him. \u201d</p><br/><p>Recently, the border had been in trouble once more. Western Yi had used fifty thousand men to attack the two cities of Wu Qiang. General of Agile Cavalry Zhong Kai had been defending the city for dozens of days. Gradually, they had begun to break it down.</p><br/><p>Emperor Yuan Hui also sent thirty thousand soldiers to support him. He ordered Yan Yu to escort the grain out a day ahead of schedule. This matter had happened so suddenly that even Yan Yu was caught off guard.</p><br/><p>Emperor Yuan Hui was trying to train him, but at the same time, he wanted him to help Zhong Kai. After he won the battle, he would definitely grant him any request.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu had no choice but to leave the city overnight and head to the border thousands of miles away.</p><br/><p>Before he left, he didn\u2019t even have time to go to the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion to say goodbye to Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>The street they walked was two streets away from Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion and he rode past, taking only a glance in that direction.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was still asleep, but she didn\u2019t hear the clang of the cavalry or the sound of the gates opening.</p><br/><p>Only when she woke up did she hear that thirty thousand soldiers and horses had left the capital.</p><br/><p>The days flowed by like water, during which time she was invited to the crown prince\u2019s residence several times.</p><br/><p>Of course, she wasn\u2019t the only one.</p><br/><p>Once the Crown Prince was there, and when she saw him from a distance, she did not even remember what he looked like.</p><br/><p>The other girls, on the other hand, were greatly moved. They were so excited that they could not calm themselves down for a long time.</p><br/><p>Crown Prince said a few words to the Crown Princess and then left. For some reason, Xie Zhen always felt that he smelled quite familiar.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, there would also be Princess He Yi, so she would sit with Ling Xiangyun.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an liked the scent on her, even pestering her to teach her how to mix spices. Unfortunately, the timing and location were inconvenient, so in the end, she had no choice but to give up.</p><br/><p>One day, Princess He Yi went to Palace Zhaoyang to pay respects to Empress Wang, and she happened to see Yan Tao was there.</p><br/><p>Empress Wang is weak and sickly, often entangled in sickbed, the body is very weak.</p><br/><p>Even so, she was dressed with dignity and elegance, appearing calm and collected. Her pale lips only added a hint of weakness to her expression.</p><br/><p>She was forty years old, and even if she kept herself in good shape, there were faint lines at the corners of her eyes, and her smile was more pronounced.</p><br/><p>Today, she looked better, and her face was redder than before.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an was talking to her from below when Yan Tao arrived.</p><br/><p>Empress Wang pulled out a smile and asked him to sit down, \u201cWhy are you the only one here today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Tao took the initiative to bow, lifting his robe and sitting down. He smiled and said, \u201cXiang Wu is not feeling well, so I let her stay at home to recuperate, so as to avoid letting you have her illness.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he looked to the other side and called out to his sixth sister. He then continued to speak to Empress Wang, \u201cImperial Mother looks alright today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Empress Wang said, \u201cYao An accompanied me for a while before I felt more spirited.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t forget to take care of Ling Xiangwu\u2019s body, and told him to take care of her properly.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cMother, don\u2019t worry. The doctor has already seen it. It\u2019s just an ordinary cold, so it\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The empress replied, \u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Mother and son sat together, saying nothing but caring things.</p><br/><p>Empress Wang thought about the recent upheaval at the border, Empress Wang couldn\u2019t help but ask worriedly, \u201cHow\u2019s the war over there? Did His Majesty call you over to take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head. \u201cWith Sixth Brother there, there should be no need for me to go over.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few days ago, reports had traveled from the border, saying Western Yi was caught off guard by the thirty thousands soldiers. Immediately, they gave up on attacking the city and decided to retreat ten kilometers.</p><br/><p>Of course, Western Yi would never give up so easily. They had set up camp ten miles outside the city and discussed strategies to fight back.</p><br/><p>Each of Yan Yu and Zhong Kai was defending a city. It was said that Western Yi had been defeated.</p><br/><p>It wouldn\u2019t take long for them to get back.</p><br/><p>While they were talking, Yan Yao\u2019an sniffed and asked curiously, \u201cI seem to smell a familiar scent \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Empress Wang smiled and ordered someone to bring out the incense burner. \u201cAre you talking about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head and sniffed again. \u201cIt\u2019s not that, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very special lotus scent. Kind of scent only could been smelled on Ah Zhen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Empress Wang said, \u201cOh, who is this Ah Zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Empress doesn\u2019t know, Ah Zhen is the the fifth girl of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, her spice is very special, it can help people to sleep, but it also smells extremely good,\u201d Yan Yao\u2019an explained solemnly, stood up and looked around, then walked over to Yan Tao, \u201cIt seems to come from here \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She stopped and looked at the Crown Prince in disbelief.</p><br/><p>When she smelled it again, the scent was indeed coming from his body.</p><br/><p>This time, even the empress\u2019s eyes were attracted over, and their expressions were full of meaning. Yan Tao smiled and took out the perfume bag from his waist, \u201cIs this it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an received it, nodding her head incessantly. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Empress Wang called out to him with a smile in her eyes, \u201cTell your mother, what is going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Tao did not plan to say it so early. After all, that girl was not even 15 yet, so he could slowly wait for her until she was at her fifteenth birthday.</p><br/><p>This time, he couldn\u2019t hide it even if he wanted to, so he could only say: \u201cI has a light sleep, mother knows.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOnce, when I picked up her handkerchief at the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, I found that the scent of it made me sleep soundly. After that, I found her and made her sew a few scented sachet for me to wear everyday. \u201d</p><br/><p>Before Empress Wang had even opened her mouth to speak, Yan Yao\u2019an had already opened her eyes wide in surprise. \u201cBig Brother Crown Prince, your \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour sachet was from Ah Zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</p><br/><p>Empress Wang understood that her son\u2019s heart was probably moved by the girl, and he was reluctant to speak, but he was hiding it in his heart.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re going to wear her sachet all the time?\u201d</p><br/><p>The empress asked.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao shook his head. At this point, he could only be honest and say, \u201cIf mother agrees, I want her to be my liangdi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing was born from a concubine, so Xie Zhen was a bit difficult for him to be the concubine. He could first call her his liangdi and then slowly invite her to be his concubine in the future.</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince had been married for many years, and there was only a Crown Princess and a few concubines in the palace. Empress Wang wanted to marry Xie Zhen as his liangdi, so the Empress did not object, \u201cYou have to tell your father about this. If he agrees, he will be able to give you an imperial decree in a few days.\u201d</p><br/><p>The meaning behind her words was, speak to the emperor yourself, she had no objections.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao let out a sigh of relief, stood up and knelt down, \u201cThank you for your help, mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since things had already been settled, Yan Yao\u2019an was left dumbfounded by what she saw.</p><br/><p>She was on good terms with Xie Zhen, so how come she didn\u2019t know that she had embroidered a sachet for the crown prince\u2026</p><br/><p>No, she\u2019d have to ask Xie Zhen next time she saw her!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

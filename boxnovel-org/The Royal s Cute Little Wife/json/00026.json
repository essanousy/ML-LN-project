Today, he finally had the chance to see her. He stared at her for a long time, but still couldn\u2019t move his eyes away.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen laughed at him, \u201cWhat are you looking at me for? Haven\u2019t you seen me for a long time, so you don\u2019t know me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun regained his senses and coughed dryly. He took a sip of the tea and cleared his throat.</p><br/><p>He could not believe her change. That was because she grow more charming in these two years. It had only been a few days, and her face was even more beautiful than the last time.</p><br/><p>She sat at the table across from him, sipping the fresh-picked Biluochun Tea, her mouth full of the aroma of tea. \u201cHow is your military affairs going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun retracted his thoughts and placed the small teacup on the table. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty much all right now. In two days, I\u2019ll be going to live in the army for a period of time.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the army, he wanted to do a good job. He was a person who had ambition and knew how to climb higher step by step. He was not willing to be in such a small corner of the Qingzhou Province and the army was the first step he took. When he heard that the capital was prosperou, he thought that he must go to the capital for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had no idea about it.</p><br/><p>In fact, she also felt that the military camp was very suitable for Gao Xun. He was not the material to study, he was free to do as he pleased, and did not like restrictions, only the military can meet these conditions. They had grown up together, and she knew many things about him, what he wanted, what was right for him, and she had always supported him.</p><br/><p>It was a long time since they last met, so the two of them sat and talked for a while. Both of them were talkative, so they didn\u2019t have to worry about not having a topic to talk to.</p><br/><p>Late in the afternoon, Gao Xun decided to say goodbye.</p><br/><p>He had said he was leaving a quarter of an hour ago, but he had no intention of leaving even now. He looked like he had something to say. He opened his mouth a few times, but no sound came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you want to tell me something?\u201d Xie Zhen asked.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun finally nodded with an unreadable expression on his face. \u201cYou should know that for the past few days, my mother has been selecting for my marriage \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had reached the age of marriage. Since last year, Madam Zhao had been planning to choose a good wife for him. All the influential families in Qingzhou were picked. Madam Zhao asked him which family he liked the most, but he said he didn\u2019t take any of them. Madam Zhao was angry. She thought that he wouldn\u2019t marry for the rest of his life. Recently, she was truly worried. If he joined the army, wouldn\u2019t getting married and having children be even more hopeless? That\u2019s why she forced him a little harder these days.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? You still don\u2019t like them?\u201d Xie Zhen felt funny.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun looked at her and nodded earnestly.</p><br/><p>She spread out her hands and shook her head. \u201cYou don\u2019t like this, and you don\u2019t like that either. What kind of girl are you looking for?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she smiled, her eyes were curved, as bright as the stars.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun watched her for a moment, then asked with a smile that was not a smile, \u201cHow about a girl like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was very surprised.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun was hurt by her reaction. He put one hand on his cheek and a smile played around his lips. \u201cAh Zhen, we\u2019ve known each other for so long. Have you ever considered marrying me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head almost without hesitation. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how close they were, she never thought about it. She thought that they were just playmates without any lust in their hearts. They could not be any purer.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you think of it?\u201d Gao Xun\u2019s eyes darkened.</p><br/><p>She was stumped by his question. Why \u2026 She racked her brains, but a flash of inspiration suddenly flashed across her mind. \u201cMother said that I\u2019m still young, so I\u2019m not in a hurry to get married!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was obviously using an excuse to stop him.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun looked at her in disappointment, as if she had abandoned him.</p><br/><p>He had made no secret of his love for her these last few years, and had given her every hint, but she was a first-rate fool, and there was always a reason to send him away. In fact, she had taken him for a good friend and had no other thought. But he was stubborn, and the more he fell, the braver he became.</p><br/><p>Of course, the result hadn\u2019t changed.</p><br/><p>He intended to speak clearly this time. He was leaving. He must confess his love to her now. He just loved her, he couldn\u2019t live without her, he wanted to take her home as his wife and cherish her forever.</p><br/><p>However, after waiting for so many years, he didn\u2019t care if he waited another year or two. When he did, he would take her home.</p><br/><p>After Gao Xun left, Xie Zhen sat in the room for a long time.</p><br/><p>She rested her chin in sadness, wondering how she could make Gao Xun give up. She had no love for him, and she should not waste his time. It was better to make things clear as soon as possible.</p><br/><p>Before she could make an conclusion, Xie Xun came in with a plate of rose cake. \u201cSister, do you want some cake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen gave a glance at her younger sister. As she grew older, Xie Xun became more and more gluttonous. At the age of twelve, instead of losing the baby fat, her face became as round as a red apple. Fortunately, no matter how much she eat, she was still a pretty girl.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m not in a good mood.\u201d Xie Zhen turned away, refusing to be seduced by her.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun didn\u2019t force her sister. She put a piece of rose cake into her mouth to chew. \u201cWhy are you in a bad mood?\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter what Xie Xun ate, others would feel that was delicious. For example, she was currently eating an ordinary rose cake, but her satisfied expression made others\u2019 appetite boil. They really wanted to try out the taste of the rose cake in her hands, making her reveal such a light expression.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stepped forward, bit a little rose cake in her hand, and said \u201cYou won\u2019t understand what I mean.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho says I don\u2019t understand?\u201d Xie Xun argued, \u201cI know. Brother Gao Xun wants you to marry him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was shocked, and choked heavily on the rose cake in her mouth, and took two long gulps of water to calm herself. \u201cHow did you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun pointed to the door. \u201cI\u2019ve been standing there for a long time. Neither my sister nor brother Gao Xun saw me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was only twelve, but she already knew how to eavesdrop!</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen was five or six years old, she\u2019d been hiding in the doorway listening to his parents.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t tell mother,\u201d she warned her seriously.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun blinked. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOtherwise, I won\u2019t give you any of the desserts that Gao Xun brings me in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>She promised, \u201cI won\u2019t tell others.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, as long as she mentioned food, she would always be able to stop her.</p><br/><p>After a while, Xie Xun finished half a plate of rose cake. She licked her finger and thought back to the previous question. \u201cSister, why don\u2019t you want to marry brother Gao Xun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen shook her head and said she didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t expect that in the next moment, this little girl would say something so shocking: \u201cIf brother Li Yu wants to marry you, will you marry him?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was a long time since she heard the name, and it took her a long time to remember who it was. This name reminded her of his departure without saying a word, of his missing appointment, and she curled up slowly in her chair. \u201cOf course not.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was confused, \u201cbut weren\u2019t you fond of him before?\u201d</p><br/><p>She frowned and thought for a moment, as if that was true. At that time, she had followed behind him every day, and it was impossible to chase her away.</p><br/><p>\u201cJust because he looks good!\u201d</p><br/><p>After so many years, Li Yu\u2019s face had already become blurry. What she remembered the most clearly was that he had a face that was even prettier than a girl\u2019s.</p><br/><p>After autumn, the leaves withered and turned yellow, and the weather turned cold day by day.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing was going to report to the emperor this year and was planning to take the entire family back to the capital just in time for his mother\u2019s sixtieth birthday. If he was lucky enough to get an official position in the capital, he wouldn\u2019t need to travel between the two places every year.</p><br/><p>Before setting off, Xie Liqing wrote a letter and sent it to the Duke of Dingguo, explaining his plans.</p><br/><p>The Duke of Dingguo was delighted to see the letter. He stroked his beard and smiled. His grandsons and granddaughters were coming back. He hadn\u2019t seen them for years, he missed them so much.</p><br/><p>The Duke of Dingguo had his two courtyards and their rooms cleaned up.</p><br/><p>In Qingzhou, Xie Liqing set the date for their return on the second day of the tenth month. There were a lot of things to do before leaving. One carriage was not enouph, they had to take at least two or three. There were also maids. All of these had to be arranged.</p><br/><p>On the second day of October, the family got into the carriage and drove to the capital.</p><br/><p>Mom and Dad were in a carriage, Xie Zhen and Xie Xun in another, Xie Rong was riding outside. Occasionally, if something happened, he could scout the road.</p><br/><p>There was a heavy snow on the road. The snow was half a foot deep, and the carriage could not move at all. The journey was delayed for less than half a month, and the old lady\u2019s birthday present was imminent. Only seven or eight days remained.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing discussed with the driver to have them hurry up. Finally, they arrived at the capital before the end of November.</p><br/><p>It had been a rough journey, and two beautiful girls had been through a lot.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen lay on the seat lazily. As soon as the carriage drove into the capital, there was a lot of noise and prosperity in her ears, much more so than in Qingzhou. She sat up abruptly on the mattress and listened. The sound was so familiar that it gave her the illusion of returning to her hometown.</p><br/><p>Although she was still young when she left the capital, her subconscious told her that the capital was her birthplace.</p><br/><p>Now that she had finally returned to this place, it had been nine years.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Gu Yi turned his head to look at Gu Ruyi, and his clear eyes were filled with a helpless smile: \u201cWhy are you still hiding your face at home? Didn\u2019t I say that it\u2019s not scary? \u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Ruyi slowly took off her veil. A strand of hair as black as silk slipped to the side of her cheek, and with her plain hands behind her ears, she said a little desolately: \u201cThe reason why Big Brother doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s scary is because Big Brother is used to looking at it \u2026 I don\u2019t want to scare people. \u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yi\u2019s eyes showed his tender affection as she sighed. He didn\u2019t know how to comfort her.</p><br/><p>Sixteen years ago, when his mother gave birth to Ruyi, he was only two or three years old. However, Ru Yi had a birthmark on her face when she was born. At first, it wasn\u2019t obvious, but at the age of four or five, it became darker and darker. It was imprinted on her palm-sized face, affecting her beauty. There were a lot of children in the mansion, and all of them were ignorant. Some of them liked to talk about things with her face, saying that she was ugly in front of her. He remembered that Ru Yi used to love smiling. Gradually, the smile on her face faded, and the light in her eyes dimmed. When she was seven or eight years old, she went out and wore a veil. Gu Yi had taught her bullies a lesson, but she still couldn\u2019t get rid of her inferiority complex. Even now, she still thought of herself as an ugly bastard.</p><br/><p>Actually, she wasn\u2019t ugly at all. If she didn\u2019t have that birthmark, she would definitely be a very beautiful girl.</p><br/><p>Gu Yi had said these words to her many times, but she had never believed them.</p><br/><p>She had visited famous doctors at home and tried every possible way to cure the birthmark on her face, but she had tried many different methods, but none of them had the slightest effect.</p><br/><p>Gu Ruyi had already started to give up. Since she had come here for so many years, she might as well not marry and stay at home for the rest of her life. As long as her father and mother did not mind, she would accompany them for life.</p><br/><p>However, the Grand Secretariat Gu Couple couldn\u2019t really let her not marry for her entire life.</p><br/><p>They wouldn\u2019t give up even if there was a tiny way.</p><br/><p>So did Gu Yi.</p><br/><p>Gu Yi accompanied her to the study room to choose a few books. After coming out from the study room, he told servant to bring a bottle of green glazed lotus flower pattern inside the room and handed it over to Gu Ruyi, \u201cThis is a good medicine that I got someone to bring back from Jiang-Nan village. It is said that it is a medicine concocted using ancestral medicine by an almond Lin and warm doctor.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t good for Gu Ruyi to spoil his mood, she received the ointment but she couldn\u2019t help but say: \u201cBig Brother doesn\u2019t need to look for these for me in the future \u2026 \u2026 I\u2019ve tried so many different kinds of medicines, but none of them are of any use, so this shouldn\u2019t be an exception. \u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yi didn\u2019t agree with her, \u201cHow can you know if it\u2019s going to work if you haven\u2019t tried it? I went through a lot of trouble to get this back, so you have to be more careful. \u201d</p><br/><p>After which, he straightened his face and put on a serious expression.</p><br/><p>Gu Ruyi giggled, and waved the medicine bottle in his hand, \u201cAlright, I understand, how can I let down big brother\u2019s good intentions?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her smile was very pretty. The dark red birthmark had turned into the character of a butterfly, as if it wanted to flap its wings and fly away. Even the redness had become delicate. It was a pity that she did not laugh often, a smile that came from the bottom of her heart that she had not seen once for a long time. It was only because once, when she smiled, the daughter of her uncle\u2019s family said in disgust, \u201cYou look even uglier when you smile.\u201d</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t confident to begin with, and after hearing this, she didn\u2019t dare to laugh.</p><br/><p>Gu Yi felt both heartache and helplessness. The only thing he could do was find a way to make her happy.</p><br/><p>On the way back, Gu Ruyi coincidentally met the Fourth Miss, Gu Youxiang, and the the fifth girl, Gu Jin Xiu, both of whom were born to Second and Third Aunt respectively. The two of them walked in front of Gu Ruyi, bowing and calling out \u201cthird sister\u201d. On the surface, they had a respectful and respectful attitude, but a smile that was not a smile appeared on their lips, it was a smile filled with ridicule.</p><br/><p>Gu Ruyi had seen this gaze too many times, she didn\u2019t want to argue with them, so she was about to leave when she heard Gu Jinxiu call out to her, \u201cDid third sister come from a cultivation garden?\u201d</p><br/><p>She glanced back at him. \u201cSo what if I went to visit you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Jin Xiu was fourteen this year and spoke timidly: \u201cI heard that the eldest young master of the Xie family came to visit elder brother just now. Did third sister meet him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Ruyi declined to comment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI saw General Zhong from afar during his birthday banquet. He is truly a handsome man, I wonder if it is possible for the third sister to tell me about him?\u201d Gu Jin Xiu looked at her expectantly.</p><br/><p>Her eyes moved slightly as she smiled gently, \u201cSister the fifth sister wants to know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Jinxiu nodded shyly and timidly.</p><br/><p>She calmly said, \u201cThank you young master, you have not gone far. I, the fifth sister, will still be able to see him one last time when I go to the entrance of the mansion.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was obviously warm-hearted in giving suggestions, but she choked on Gu Jin Xiu\u2019s advice until she had nothing to say. They couldn\u2019t really chase him to the door, could they? What a drop.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she did not answer, Gu Ruyi said that he had other things to do so he left first.</p><br/><p>Watching her leave, Gu Jin Xiu snorted at Gu Laixiang: \u201cIsn\u2019t it just seeing you one more time than us? What\u2019s there to be proud of?\u201d She\u2019s so ugly, Young Master Xie wouldn\u2019t fall for her! \u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Jixiang stood off to the side and agreed. \u201cMaybe Young Master Xie was scared away by her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as they were about to turn around and leave, they were startled by Gu Yi, who had suddenly appeared in the corner.</p><br/><p>Gu Jiaxiang and Gu Jinxiang looked at Gu Yi, whose expression was as dark as water, and felt weak in their hearts. They retreated half a step and said in unison, \u201cBig brother \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yi stood with his hands behind his back, looking at the two of them. \u201cIs this how Second Madame and Third Madame usually teach you guys etiquette?\u201d</p><br/><p>When it came to their biological mother, both of them were a little timid. They lowered their heads and said, \u201cWe were the ones who lost our minds. Please forgive us, Big Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yi walked past them, looking completely selfless. \u201cI\u2019ll report this to Father and ask him to find a master to teach you guys. Second Madame and Third Madame must have misguided him.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he left, ignoring the two\u2019s pleas for him.</p><br/><p>Grand Secretariat Gu paid the most attention to etiquette and justice, and believed that a woman should obey a woman\u2019s virtue. Not to mention that the Daoist people behind her were talking nonsense, even she should be respectful and respectful to her elder sister. If he told the Grand Secretariat Gu that their mother had been scolded, they would also be forced to learn etiquette. The masters Grand Secretariat Gu had invited were all very strict, there was no need to be lazy at all.</p><br/><p>Returning to the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, Xie Rong brought the Bamboo Cloud map to Xie Xun\u2019s room and helped her hang it on the wall.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun used to think that it was just a painting, but now that he found out what his mother was thinking, there were some words hanging in the room that Gu Yi said. She wanted Xie Rong to take off the painting, but he touched her head and said: \u201cI\u2019ve specially made a trip for you, at least you have to hang on for a few days to be able to live up to your brother\u2019s feelings, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun thought about it and agreed, \u201cAlright then.\u201d</p><br/><p>She reluctantly agreed.</p><br/><p>Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion and Xie Liqing only had this plan, and no one knew who leaked it, but when the news spread out, some of the more reputable officials in capital knew about it. Everyone knew about it, but no one intentionally pointed it out.</p><br/><p>When the news reached the general\u2019s manor, Zhong Shang was in the midst of sparring with a guard within the manor.</p><br/><p>He stopped and kept his snake spear, turned to servant and asked: \u201cSay it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>The other guard couldn\u2019t react in time. He frowned as he saw the stick was about to hit his shoulder. He waved the gun to the side and said in an impatient tone: \u201cScram!\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard did not dare to provoke him and stood up to one side.</p><br/><p>The messenger, servant, vigilantly repeated, \u201cI heard that the Xie Family\u2019s Seven Young Miss is going to be engaged to Gu Yi \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In the past few days, even though Zhong Shang did not go find Xie Xun, he had the servant wait outside the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion. In the past few days, Xie Xun did not leave the palace. He thought that she would obediently stay in the mansion.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s mind was in a mess, he threw the snake spear back to the weapon rack and knocked over a row of weapons. He paced back and forth in the courtyard twice, and the more he walked, the uglier his expression got. \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s true?\u201d</p><br/><p>servant hurriedly nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely true!\u201d</p><br/><p>How many days has it been?</p><br/><p>Then Xiao Budian is going to be engaged?</p><br/><p>How old is she!</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang frowned, he did not know where this depression came from, but it was like a wildfire, engulfing him completely.</p><br/><p>That night, after Xie Xun finished showering, half of her dry hair fell behind her back and covered her slender shoulders. She was wearing only a thin woolen sweater, and was currently sitting at the head of her bed, reading through the gossip of the people while drinking rose almond porridge. She was halfway through drinking the porridge and felt that the porridge was not sweet enough. She was just about to ask Shuang Que to add more sugar when she suddenly saw a tall and straight figure jump in from outside as the half-opened window was pushed open.</p><br/><p>His back was against the light, and his expression was dark and unfathomable.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was startled, the porridge bowl dropping to the ground, he opened his mouth to call for someone: \u201cShua!\u201d</p><br/><p>However, that person arrived in front of her even faster and covered her mouth, then came close to her and whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t scream!\u201d</p><br/><p>The bowl of congee just happened to fall on the ground, the thick blanket alleviated the impact of landing on the ground, the congee scattered on the ground, but the bowl rolled on the ground and only made a small muffled sound.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun opened his eyes wide, just by looking at the moonlight, he was able to see the person in front of him, with his sharp eyebrows and clear starry eyes. Wasn\u2019t that Zhong Shang?</p><br/><p>She was shocked, \u201cBig brother Zhong Shang \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>How did he get to her house?</p><br/><p>No one noticed?</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang slowly let go of her, stood up straight, and went straight to the point, \u201cI heard that you\u2019re engaged to Gu Yi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was suspicious, how did he know? Did he come here just to ask that?</p><br/><p>Without waiting for her reply, Zhong Shang raised his head and just happened to see a painting on the opposite wall. If it was some other painting, then it would be fine, but the words at the bottom of the painting said \u2014 Spread out.</p><br/><p>It was Gu Yi\u2019s handwriting.</p><br/><p>The expression on his face, which had just eased up after seeing her, instantly turned ugly.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not know about what happened in Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion in the past few days, because something even bigger happened in the imperial court.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu never avoided her when she was talking to the guards, so she had a rough understanding of the situation.</p><br/><p>Some of the Ping Wang\u2019s subordinates had been taken advantage of by the crown prince, some had been impeached by officials, and all sorts of crimes had been prosecuted. Even more than half of the food aid that the imperial court sent last year had been taken away by the Ping Wang\u2019s men. After the Emperor Yuan Hui found out, he flew into a rage and took off the black muslin hats of more than 120 officials. Among them, 100 were the Ping Wang fans.</p><br/><p>The Ping Wang power was greatly reduced. Originally, he wanted to stay at home to recuperate and gather his strength, but then something big happened.</p><br/><p>Recently, Emperor Yuan Hui\u2019s body was getting worse every day, and he would occasionally cough due to lack of Qi, causing doctors to be unable to diagnose him. The illness had dragged on for half a month, and Emperor Yuan Hui was getting weaker and weaker, not even having the strength to get out of bed. At the same time, rumors suddenly began to spread that His Majesty was about to ascend to the pinnacle of happiness. The Crown Prince was gentle, and was not the best candidate to be the crown prince.</p><br/><p>Unknowingly, the words had reached Emperor Yuan Hui and he had sent his guards to Lord Ping\u2019s mansion to search for it. Unexpectedly, he found a little person wrapped in paper under his bed. Not only that, they even found a gown embroidered with a golden dragon pattern in Yan Yun\u2019s study. The size of the robe was exactly similar to Yan Yun\u2019s.</p><br/><p>When the guards brought all of these things back to the palace, Emperor Yuan Hui was immediately angered to the point of spitting out a mouthful of blood, as he fell into a coma.</p><br/><p>After waking up, the first thing Emperor Yuan Hui did was to summon Duke Ping into the palace and ask him what was going on. The Emperor Yuan Hui was completely disappointed by him, and did not have the mood to fight with him for a long time. He sent out the decree to seize his prince\u2019s position, changed the title of Gao Yang, and left for Gao Yang in three days. In this life, he was not allowed to step even half a step into the capital.</p><br/><p>Today was the day Yan Yun was leaving the capital, so Xie Zhen and Yan Yu sat together on in the porch. servant maids carried two cups of cold jujube juice, which was used to relieve the summer heat.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was about to raise her cup to drink, but Yan Yu stopped her, asking servant maids to change a cup of warm tea.</p><br/><p>She protested, \u201cI\u2019m going to burn my tea on such a hot day.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu looked at her stomach, \u201cWeren\u2019t you screaming in pain yesterday? It doesn\u2019t hurt anymore today? \u201d</p><br/><p>She had just come in the previous month and was lying in his arms, hugging her belly and humming and talking a lot of nonsense. Her stomach would hurt every few days, and sometimes the pain was so intense that she couldn\u2019t even get out of bed. The mama had instructed her not to eat cold, but unfortunately, she didn\u2019t have the heart to remember anything, and had to be under Yan Yu\u2019s supervision every day.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was speechless, \u201cAlright then \u2026 Let\u2019s drink hot tea. \u201d</p><br/><p>She moved closer to Yan Yu, holding his hand and placing it on her stomach, \u201cBig brother Xiao Yu can give me some light air?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, it was no longer hot.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s hand was placed on her flat stomach, and with his other hand, he used his sleeve to wipe the sweat off her forehead.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked up at him and couldn\u2019t help but raise his hand to smooth the crease on his forehead. \u201cWhy do you keep frowning? Is there something bothering you? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu grabbed her hand, and after a moment of silence, he nodded his head.</p><br/><p>She immediately sat up with an expression of interest. \u201cWhat is it? The First Prince went to Gao Yang. Could it be that it\u2019s because of him? \u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head, looked at her and asked seriously: \u201cLittle Lamb, when will you give me a child?\u201d</p><br/><p>He worked hard day and night. It had been two or three months, yet he still couldn\u2019t get her pregnant?</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t know how good it would be if she were pregnant with their child.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was startled, her face slightly flushed, \u201cHow would I know? Again \u2026 It\u2019s not like I can control it. \u201d</p><br/><p>He chuckled and thought about it, \u201c\u2026 I can handle it. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen glared at him, raising his hand to cover\u2019s mouth, telling him not to say anymore.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They were the victors of Da Jing.</p><br/><p>After returning to the palace, Emperor Yuan Hui personally hosted a banquet to invite the officials of the imperial court to celebrate with the sixth prince and the general.</p><br/><p>The next morning, Yan Yu returned to the Qing Jia Palace. After sleeping for only two hours, he was awakened by the noise from outside.</p><br/><p>The young eunuch Yuan Quan stood guard at the door, feeling awkward. He said to Yan Yao\u2019an, \u201cPrincess, Your Highness has just fallen asleep \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe endured the hardships of a long journey, he probably didn\u2019t even have a good rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an was in a hurry, so she didn\u2019t care about any of this at all. She got someone to push him to the side, then pushed open the door and entered. \u201cSixth Brother, Sixth Brother!\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, there were some rules so that she didn\u2019t directly break into the inner room and bring him up. Instead, she stood outside the screen and called out a few times.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not open his eyes. He raised the back of his hand to his forehead and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><br/><p>All these years, she had been spoiled even more unruly due to her father\u2019s love for her. They were no longer children, yet she actually barged in without a care for the difference between men and women. It seemed it was time for her to be properly taught.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an went straight to the point. \u201cTake me out of the palace once more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu immediately refused, \u201cI\u2019m busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had planned to get some sleep first, then take a shower and change his clothes to see Xie Zhen, but now it was impossible for him to get a good night\u2019s sleep.</p><br/><p>He only wished that the last two matters would not be disturbed.</p><br/><p>How could Yan Yao\u2019an be so easily dismissed? If she wanted to go out of the palace, she had no choice but to beg him.</p><br/><p>If he didn\u2019t agree, she would sit outside and waste her time with him. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take me out, I\u2019ll make a ruckus here!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said this, she knocked the small black colored lid on the table, causing it to rattle loudly. \u201cYou agree or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu frowned and asked impatiently, \u201cWhat are you doing for going out of the palace?\u201d</p><br/><p>She blurted out, \u201cTo visit Xie Zhen.\u201d</p><br/><p>The room was silent for a long time. Just when Yan Yao\u2019an thought he was asleep, he asked in a hoarse voice, \u201cWhy do you want to see her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an let out a long sigh, looking extremely sorrowful. \u201cA few days ago, I met second brother at Palace Zhaoyang.\u201d</p><br/><p>The second brother wore scented sachet embroidered by Ah Zhen and said that he would take her as his concubine. I wanted to ask her personally if it was true, but why did she never tell me? \u201d</p><br/><p>After finish talking, it became extremely silent in the room.</p><br/><p>\u201cSixth Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>she asked softly.</p><br/><p>After a while, Yan Yu\u2019s cold voice came out, \u201cYou said that second brother is going to take her as his concubine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an nodded. She had heard the truth that day, so there shouldn\u2019t have been any mistakes.</p><br/><p>That was why she was puzzled. Why did it happen?</p><br/><p>\u201cFrom what esteemed empress says, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any objections.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Second Brother tells father that, then I\u2019m guessing that the next step would be granting the marriage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an heard the sound of something falling on the ground, which was extremely ear-piercing, causing Yan Yao\u2019an to jump in fright. \u201cSixth Brother, are you alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no movement from inside. Not long after, Yan Yu walked out from inside. He had already changed his clothes and was neatly dressed. His face was cold as he appeared in front of her.</p><br/><p>His pupils were cold, his brow was low, and he carried a sharp sense of heroic spirit. He didn\u2019t say anything else, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll take you there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an was overjoyed. She followed him and said, \u201d Cuiying attic in the south. I have got someone to tell her about the meeting with her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu strode in front, not caring if she could keep up with him or not.</p><br/><p>Within the Cuiying attic.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen came early and sat in the private room for a moment.</p><br/><p>She did not know what was going on in the palace, nor did she know that the Crown Prince had already set his mind on her. Recently, she had heard the most praise the sixth prince\u2019s return, praising him everywhere for his rare deeds of honor.</p><br/><p>She had never heard of the sixth prince before and only found out about his existence after she returned to the capital.</p><br/><p>As Xie Zhen was thinking, the door of the private room was pushed open. Yan Yao\u2019an poked her head around, and when she saw her, her eyes lit up and she rushed over to hug her.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was frightened by her enthusiasm, she leaned back a little. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with the Princess?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an let Qing Feng and Bai Lu stand guard outside the door. After closing the door, she pulled her aside and whispered to her, \u201cDo you know my second brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an had always been straightforward. She was unable to learn how to be courteous, so she could say whatever she wanted to say. Therefore, when she began to speak, Xie Zhen was shocked a lot.</p><br/><p>The current crown prince was ranked the second. It was precisely Yan Yao\u2019an\u2019s second brother. How could she possibly know the crown prince?</p><br/><p>She shook her head like a rattle. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an stared into her eyes and asked again.</p><br/><p>She still answered that she didn\u2019t know him.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen really don\u2019t know him. Although Xie Zhen went to the crown prince\u2019s mansion a few times, she would always stay in the backyard with other wives. She has never met the crown prince in private, so how could she not know him?</p><br/><p>Seeing that it didn\u2019t seem like she was lying, Yan Yao\u2019an began to wonder, \u201cThat\u2019s strange. You don\u2019t know him, so how could he have a scented sachet of yours embroidered on him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was shocked. \u201cWhat is the scented sachet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an repeated what had happened that day at the Palace Zhaoyang, describing it in a sonorous and colourful manner, making them feel as if they were in the scene of their lives. When she heard the words \u201csecond brother said he wanted to take you as his concubine\u201d, she froze.</p><br/><p>If she remembered correctly, her scented sachet had only been sent out once. The other party\u2019s surname was Tao, and his wife was Madam Ling.</p><br/><p>His wife couldn\u2019t sleep well at night, so she made a few scented sachets and sent them to her to help her sleep.</p><br/><p>Her hands and feet were cold, and she carefully held Yan Yao\u2019an\u2019s hand as she asked, \u201cThe scented sachet that you mentioned \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs there a jasminum flower on it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an tried her best to recall it.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt seems so. The fragrance of the scented sachet is the same as yours. It has a faint fragrance of lotus.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s heart is like dead ashes. She sat back for a long time without saying a word.</p><br/><p>She thought she was smart enough to think things through, but in the end she was fooled into a mess.</p><br/><p>The crown prince\u2019s name was Yan Tao, so he said his surname was Tao.</p><br/><p>The Crown Princess\u2019s name was Ling Xiangwu, so his wife became Madam Ling.</p><br/><p>She thought that she had met a good person, but did not realize the man was clearly a fraud!</p><br/><p>Too bad, too bad.</p><br/><p>They had never interacted with each other before, much less said a single word. Could it be that just by relying on a scented sachet, he wanted her?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen clenched her teeth tightly, her little face became paler and paler, and she was about to faint out of anger.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to be anyone\u2019s concubine, not even the Crown Prince\u2019s concubine. This was the thought that the Madam Leng instilled into her since she was young. It was deeply ingrained and would remain the same for a period of time.</p><br/><p>Seeing that her expression was off, Yan Yao\u2019an felt that something wasn\u2019t quite right. She walked over to her and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe scented sachets aren\u2019t what you embroidered?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was regretful and said, \u201cI did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an was speechless.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was to tear. She didn\u2019t expect it. She told Yan Yao\u2019an everything that had happened a while ago, and then she held the last of her hope and grabbed Yan Yao\u2019an\u2019s sleeve, \u201cCan you tell His Majesty, please don\u2019t grant the marriage?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to marry the crown prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an felt a headache. She shouldn\u2019t interfere in this matter either.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Second Brother mentioned it to Imperial father, then even I wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen felt as if she had no hope at all.</p><br/><p>Just as she was about to faint, the door of the private room was kicked open from the outside. With a bang, Yan Yu stood in the doorway, looking at Xie Zhen with a cold face.</p><br/><p>Everyone outside and inside the door was stunned as they stared at him.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t expect him to suddenly appear. Before she could call out the name that was hovering around her mouth, Yan Yao\u2019an said in surprise, \u201cSixth Brother, why did you come in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen froze.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu walked in step by step, finally stopping in front of Xie Zhen, looking down at her from above. He said to Yan Yao\u2019an with an expressionless face, \u201cYou go out first, I have something to say to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that something was wrong, Yan Yao\u2019an quickly got up from the mattress, her gaze sweeping over the two of them. \u201cYou two \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu pursed his lips tightly and did not answer.</p><br/><p>And Xie Zhen was completely dumbfounded.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an couldn\u2019t resist her curiosity and wanted to stay behind and listen to their conversation, but was swept a cold glance by Yan Yu. She shrunk her neck and obediently withdrew from the private room.</p><br/><p>Only Xie Zhen, Yan Yu and the two servant maids Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan are left in the private room.</p><br/><p>It was no need to hide from Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan. They had been with Xie Zhen for more than ten years.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stared blankly at Yan Yu as he sat down and stared back at him.</p><br/><p>She was not even able to speak properly. \u201cYou, you are the sixth prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu glanced at her, \u201cYou don\u2019t believe it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course she didn\u2019t believe it!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t he Auntie Song and Li Xiqing\u2019s son? Why did he become the current sixth prince?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought she was dreaming, so she called Shuang Yu to her and twisted her so hard that Shuang Yu whinnied in pain, but she still didn\u2019t believe it. \u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at her. \u201cYan Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>The same name, just changed his surname.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s frustration has long been overshadowed by a string of questions: \u201cWhy did you become sixth prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Auntie Song?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou left, just to return to the capital?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us? \u201d</p><br/><p>He could not answer any of these questions. Yan Yu interrupted her coldly: \u201cDo you want to marry my second brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen was pulled back into reality, her mood sank to the bottom and she shook her head gloomily. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu unconsciously clenched his fists under the table. He tried his best to sound calm, \u201cYou can marry me. I don\u2019t have a wife, so you don\u2019t have to be a concubine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was a little puzzled, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>He tilted his head and said, \u201cIf you marry me, second brother won\u2019t bother you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Now, at last she understood, and it was almost panic. \u201cWait a minute.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do you want to marry me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou, don\u2019t you hate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t trying to take revenge on her, was he?</p><br/><p>It occurred to Xie Zhen that if he married her, he could torture her.</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, she couldn\u2019t help but shudder.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu suddenly turned around and glared at her, \u201cI\u2019m at the age of marriage. If I don\u2019t have someone I like, I can only marry you first.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t touch you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tried to understand, and stuttered, \u201cCan you let me think about it for a few days\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr maybe I could discuss it with my parents \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he stood up and spoke with a tone that was not gentle at all, \u201cIf you continue to think about it, you will have to marry second brother as his liangdi. It\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He raised his foot and was about to leave.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen scrambled to her feet, grabbing his hand in desperation, soft fingers digging into the palm of his hand and making him stand there.</p><br/><p>She spoke in a conferential tone, \u201cThen do you think you can marry me just because you want to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan the Emperor agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>She thought they could still hold each other\u2019s hands as they had when they were children.</p><br/><p>It took a lot of effort for Yan Yu to hold her hand. \u201cI\u2019ll find a way.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked at the side of his face, looked at him, suddenly a little sad, she sniffled, \u201cOther than marrying you, there is really no other way\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe was still very unwilling?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe has wronged her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was a little angry, he turned around and stared at her, \u201cIf you marry me, you\u2019ll be the Royal\u2019s Wife, and your status will be much higher than the Crown Prince\u2019s liangdi.\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew, of course, but she still felt a little unreal.</p><br/><p>Just a moment ago, he was still the ordinary Li Yu, but how did he become the beloved sixth prince the next moment?</p><br/><p>She had not yet accepted his identity, and was beginning to learn to accept another.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

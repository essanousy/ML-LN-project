Her mind was a mess as she tried to think of a way to break free from him. \u201cWuu \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu\u2019s voice was just behind her. She wanted to call her, but the person in front of her tightly covered her mouth. She could only make a muffled sound.</p><br/><p>Even if he was handsome, it was inevitable that she would feel fear when he treated her like this in the wilderness.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s long eyelashes blinked briefly, and a tear fell on the back of his hand.</p><br/><p>It was as if he had been scalded and his tone was vicious. \u201cWhat are you crying about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stared at him. He caught her here for no apparent reason, then why wouldn\u2019t he let her cry.</p><br/><p>However, her eyes did not have any power. Her eyes reddened, and she looked like an enraged rabbit with a pitiful look.</p><br/><p>Perhaps to oppose him, he wouldn\u2019t let her cry, but she was crying harder and harder, tears falling silently, running down her smooth face into his hands.</p><br/><p>When he finally surrendered, he could not bear to see her cry, so he feigned an evil expression, \u201cI will let go of you, you are not allowed to call anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen obediently nodded.</p><br/><p>As soon as he took his hand away, she screamed for help. \u201cShuang Yu, I\u2019m here \u2014\u201d His eyes deepened, and he looked exasperated. \u201cYou!\u201d</p><br/><p>He should have known long ago that she was just a little fox, extremely crafty. What she said was ithout a few words of truth, how could he easily believe her?</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu heard the sound and hurried over. When she saw the two persons overlapping behind the tree, she gave a cry of alarm and threw herself at them, wanting to pull him away. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet go of my girl!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could get close, she was stopped by a guard who appeared out of nowhere.</p><br/><p>The guard\u2019s eyes were cold and his tone was resolute. \u201cStep back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard was dressed in black, with a knife at his waist. When he spoke to Shuang Yu, his sharp blade froze Shuang Yu where she stood.</p><br/><p>Just now, Xie Zhen was too focused on resisting the man in front of her that she didn\u2019t pay attention to the situation around her. As soon as she saw what was happening, her heart instantly turned cold.</p><br/><p>There were actually guards? Then wouldn\u2019t it be even more impossible for her to escape \u2026</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu looked at her from a distance, in a dilemma. \u201cGirl\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen pursed her lips, wiped her tears with her sleeve, and looked aggressively at the man in front of her. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t get an answer after a long time.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know which sentence angered him, but his eyes became even darker as he stared straight at her without saying a word.</p><br/><p>How did she know what he wanted to do?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t say anything, and she kept wasting time with him. It was best to wait until Xie Rong came back, so she could be saved.</p><br/><p>Although her plan was perfecrt, he was not easy to deal with. He finally asked, \u201cAre you sure you can\u2019t remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tilted her head, her eyes filled with doubt. \u201cWhat should I remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was damned good. He had remembered her for so many years that he could not forget her, but she had forgotten him in the twinkling of an eye.</p><br/><p>How could he not have noticed before that she was such a heartless person. She was clearly pestering him to death when she was young, and she kept saying \u201cI missed you!\u201d \u201cI like Brother Xiao Yu \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that he was standing in front of her, she couldn\u2019t remember who he was!</p><br/><p>They stared at each other for a moment, and then Xie Zhen looked around and saw that he had only one guard with him, and that there was no one else around.</p><br/><p>She wanted to run, and if Xie Xun heared her, she would be saved.</p><br/><p>However, reality was still cruel. The moment she moved her feet, he grabbed her wrist and pressed her back down to the tree trunk. \u201cDid I let you run?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen really wanted to cry. \u201cYou don\u2019t let me run,\u201d she said, choking. \u201cYou don\u2019t tell me what you\u2019re going to do. Don\u2019t you just want to talk to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, he turned his head and asked in a hoarse voice, \u201cDid you go to fly a kite that day?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he had grown taller, he was still a teenager. His voice had recently changed, and when he spoke, there was a special tone to it. It was a little hoarse and a little heavy, but it was not unpleasant to the ears.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was confused for a while. What was it? Fly a kite?</p><br/><p>It had been a long time since she had flown a kite. Ever since she was stood up when she was young, she had never touched a kite.</p><br/><p>She remembered that the goose kite that her father had given her had been left in the storehouse. She didn\u2019t bring it back with her when she returned to the capital \u2026</p><br/><p>She suddenly recalled something. She looked at the man in front of her in shock, staring incredulously into his face, over and over again.</p><br/><p>He slowly released her hand and his gaze returned to her face. After looking at it for a moment, his gaze moved away again. \u201cIf you still want to fly a kite \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can take you to. \u201d</p><br/><p>Someone had spoken to her that way a long time ago.</p><br/><p>There was impatience in every word, but his eyes were as expectant as hers.</p><br/><p>It was the deepest memory in her heart. She had buried it since long time ago, and when the memory came out again, she felt as if it had been a lifetime ago.</p><br/><p>At the time they were both children, small and naive.</p><br/><p>They leaned against the wall, with the sun above their heads, and talked for most of the day.</p><br/><p>\u201cMy family has bought a new courtyard outside of the city. The scenery there is good. It\u2019s a good place to fly a kite.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you want to fly a kite?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYour yard is so small, how can you fly a kite?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI can take you there.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026.</p><br/><p>She could still remember how he sounded fierce, but before he could finish speaking, he had already blushed.</p><br/><p>She asked him why he was blushing, and he said it was because of the sun.</p><br/><p>In her memory, his young face overlapped with the person in front of her. She finally remembered his name and slowly said: \u201cBrother Xiao Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that moment, Li Yu felt as if all the burdens on him had been unloaded.</p><br/><p>After so many years, he didn\u2019t expect to hear her call him \u2018Brother Xiao Yu\u2019 again.</p><br/><p>He involuntarily clenched his fists and refrained from embracing her.</p><br/><p>His arms leaned against the trunk and he lowered his body to get close to her, so that she could not see his expression. After a moment, he said in a hoarse voice, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen blinked, still feeling unreal.</p><br/><p>They were too close for her to see his expression, her nose against his chest.</p><br/><p>It was only then that she realized how far apart they were in height.</p><br/><p>When she was younger she was taller than he was, and now she\u2019s only up to his chest?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was stunned. She lightly opened her mouth and temporarily forgot about his previous rudeness. \u201cWhy is it you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you left? Where did you go at that time?\u201d</p><br/><p>She asked him a series of questions. He was silent for a long time before he answered, \u201cI came to the capital \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen grabbed the cloth in front of his chest, tilted her head and tried to see his face, to reconfirm if he was Li Yu. \u201cWhy did you come to capital?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about Auntie Song and the others?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell us when you left \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, she wanted to blame him for not telling them anything when he left, but she recalled what Ouyang Yi said that year. She said that he left because he hated her, and that if it wasn\u2019t for her, he wouldn\u2019t have moved at all.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen instantly fell silent. When she thought back of his attitude towards her just now. Wasn\u2019t he extremely disgusted with her \u2026</p><br/><p>She seemed to have bullied him a lot when she was young. Did he still hold a grudge now?</p><br/><p>Li Yu did not notice her abnormality because his attention was focused on the second question.</p><br/><p>His pupils were black, and they flickered with an indescribable luster. He did not answer her questions.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had asked for a snub, so she pushed him with her hands, and got out of his arms. \u201cWhat are you doing in the capital?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of you bringing me here? \u201d</p><br/><p>His arms suddenly became empty. He recovered his expressionless face and said, \u201cWhy did you come to the capital?\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how she asked, he wouldn\u2019t say anything about himself.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was a little disappointed. After so many years since they last saw each other, they were not as close as before, and he was trying to hide something from her.</p><br/><p>However, it didn\u2019t matter. She wasn\u2019t the kind of person who pursued the root of the problem. Thus, she curved her eyes into a sincere smile and said, \u201cMy home is in Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion in the capital. I came back with my father and mother. I don\u2019t think I will ever leave again.\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded and said nothing.</p><br/><p>No one said anything. The atmosphere was rather awkward.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Xie Xun realized that something was wrong. She came over to find her, called her sister loudly, and soon found her.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen wanted to go back, but before she left she remembered to ask, \u201cWhere is your home?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you need, you can come to the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion to visit me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHmm, or you can visit my brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, they had all grown up, and there were differences between men and women.</p><br/><p>Li Yu paused and nodded slightly. When he saw that she was really going to leave, he grabbed her wrist without thinking. \u201cWhat I said just now \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tilted her head, and obviously, she had forgotten about it. \u201d What?\u201d</p><br/><p>He stared at her silently for a moment. \u201cFor flying Kites.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a moment of silence, he added, \u201cAfter all, I was the one who failed to fulfill my promise. Is it still too late to make up for it now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen smiled. \u201cIt\u2019s been so long. I\u2019ve already forgotten about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about that. After all, we\u2019re past the age of flying a kite.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu was stunned. He couldn\u2019t help but loosen his grip on her.</p><br/><p>She took the opportunity to break free and try to meet with Xie Xun. \u201cI\u2019ll be leaving first \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish his words, she was fiercely pulled by him and pressed back against the trunk.</p><br/><p>His expression was strange and somewhat unwilling. \u201cWhy did you forget? Don\u2019t you have something to tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were filled with too much meaning that he probably didn\u2019t even notice.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s back ached from the impact and she was forced to meet his angry eyes.</p><br/><p>She looked at his face and realized that he had changed a lot since he was a child. His facial features got mature, and there was a bit less handsome and more heroic than when he was young. No wonder she didn\u2019t recognize him at first.</p><br/><p>She relaxed her brow and smiled. \u201cSay what?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you hating me? Why would I ask for a snub?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu was stunned. \u201cI \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When had he hated her?</p><br/><p>If he really hated a person, he wouldn\u2019t even say a word to him.</p><br/><p>But before he could say anything, Xie Xun came over and stood a few steps away, blinking and innocently staring at them.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Ever since cousin girl\u2019s visit, the relationship between His Highness and the Princess seemed to have improved.</p><br/><p>The improvement was different from before. It was kinda the sun shining again after rain.</p><br/><p>For example, right now, His Highness was reading in the study while the princess was in the study as well. Some sound could be heard from within the study from time to time, making it unsuitable for them servant maids go in and disturb them.</p><br/><p>In the study, Xie Zhen didn\u2019t know how it had turned out like this.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu insisted that she accompany him in the study. She promised to sit there and read a book. He suddenly called her over and asked her with a stinky face: why she didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was rather baffling. Was he reading a book, wasn\u2019t he?</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t bother him, and he wasn\u2019t satisfied?</p><br/><p>Not only was Yan Yu not satisfied, he was far from satisfactory.</p><br/><p>She had been so fond of pestering him when he was young that even when he was reading, she would call him Brother Xiao Yuu sweetly from outside the window.</p><br/><p>He was not satisfied, of course, that she was not calling him now.</p><br/><p>He sat with her on the desk, his chin on the top of her head, as sullen as he was, and said, \u201cWho said you couldn\u2019t disturb me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen blinked in his arms, being muddled. \u201cYou said it yourself last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last time she had Shang Yu bring him a meal, he had sent her out with a terrible air, and had Shuang Yu tell her not to disturb him.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu remained silent for a while. He had no choice but to get back what he had said, \u201cThey can\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not fully understand . \u201cOh, I can?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen grabbed his sleeve and looked up to see his face. Her voice was soft and sweet. \u201cBrother Xiao Yu, can I?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was a teenager and was full of energy. He had no good self-control against the girl he liked, especially when she talked to him in this way. He immediately reaponded by lowering his head, finding her chattering little lips and holding them in his mouth.</p><br/><p>He was fond of kissing her, tasting her mouth so strongly and savagely that he never knew how to be gentle, and once Xie Zhen\u2019s tongue was broken by his kiss.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen felt her tongue was in pain, so she covered her mouth with her hands, trying to avoid his kisses. He was the kind of man who wouldn\u2019t admit his fault. He licked her wound tenderly and called her \u201cLittle Lamb\u201d with blushing and only then did he know how to hold back a little.</p><br/><p>As he kissed her, he gradually lost control.</p><br/><p>As Xie Zhen sat on the desk, he leaned over and put his hand on her shoulder and tasted her mouth, getting more and more unsatisfied.</p><br/><p>He was a normal man, and his desire for her was growing stronger and stronger. The last few days were her period, so he had to control himself.</p><br/><p>Her period had ended yesterday, and he could not help it any longer. His hand slipped off her shoulder and landed on her slender waist. His hand kept slipping down, and he felt her body stiffen.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu let go of her lips, lowered his head, and kissed her from her chin to her neck, then buried his head in her shoulder to take a few deep breaths. \u201cI want \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was trembling. She had a premonition about what he wanted to do, but she was unfamiliar with it. She was afraid. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>His palms were hot, and the heat came through the fabric and made her flinch.</p><br/><p>Her movement provoked him, and he could not help unbuttoning the dress from her collar with his other hand, and he buried his head in it, and kissed her skin incoherently.</p><br/><p>Her skin was delicate, and with a gentle suck there would be a red mark. He could not help but think of the apricot tofu he had eaten after dinner, which was white and tender, with a red cherry on it, and he could not bear to eat it, so he licked it slowly.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was shaking like a fallen leaf in the wind, terrified and uneasy.</p><br/><p>She shyly pushed his head and said like a mosquito, \u201d Brother Xiao Yu \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought she was just shy and wrapped her whole body in his arms and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cOkay?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLittle Lamb, shall we consummate? \u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time he had been so honest, probably because he couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and wanted to take her for himself right now.</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he grabbed one of her hands and led it to his body, sliding down to feel the hottest part of his body. \u201cI feel terrible here \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As Xie Zhen touched it, she realized what it was and tried to pull her hand back.</p><br/><p>But he held her hand tight and wouldn\u2019t let go of it.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was lost, she just let him do whatever he wanted.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu waited a moment, and there was no response. He couldn\u2019t help but look up at her.</p><br/><p>He was stunned.</p><br/><p>With tears in her eyes, she bit her lips. Her body trembled slightly as she raised her gaze to meet his, begging pitifully, \u201cWait until I am at my fifteenth birthday. Brother Xiao Yu, please wait for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu suddenly felt an unprecedented sense of guilt. He lifted her off the desk and let her sit on his lap. \u201cWhat are you crying for?\u201d</p><br/><p>She sobbed. The feel of that thing was still in her hand. It was so unfamiliar, it was not like the Yan Yu she was familiar with at all. \u201cI\u2019m scared \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu had no choice but to suppress his desire, hug her and comfort her, \u201cWhat are you scared for?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to add that how could they not consummate after they got married. However, taking into account her mood, he turned it around in his throat and swallowed it back down.</p><br/><p>He straightened her clothes, buttoned her apron with his own hands, and bit her ear. \u201cI\u2019ll kiss you if you cry any more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was really scared, and she raised her big tearful eyes, forcefully held back her tears, feeling uneasy, \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu sighed. He really couldn\u2019t do anything to her.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen wiped away her tears, and when she finally calmed herself down and rubbed her hand on his leg. \u201cI don\u2019t want to touch that place \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she pursed her lips, as if she disliked it as much as possible.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s breath was caught in his throat. He was quite angry, \u201cYou had touched it when you were young.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked at him incredulously and blurted out, \u201cHow is it possible!\u201d</p><br/><p>She had forgotten their first meeting, and she couldn\u2019t remember she had touched his crotch.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu clenched his teeth and asked word by word, \u201cDo you want to go back on your words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t remember at all.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu had to hold her waist and repeat what had happened that day. When he talked about his peeing, he paused for a moment before finally choosing to hide it: \u201cYou insisted on singing, and I didn\u2019t want to hear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was eyeing him askance. \u201cThen why did you insist on my singing last time?\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned his head. \u201cI want to check if you\u2019re still singing so badly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen made a \u201cOh\u201d sound, rubbing her eyes. \u201cThen I won\u2019t sing to you anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that he was stubborn, her mood gradually improved. She cunningly asked, \u201cBrother Xiao Yu, do you want to hear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He tensed. \u201cI don\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen climbed out of his arms. She was smiling as she stood in front of him, her clear, bright eyes looking at him.</p><br/><p>He felt guilty and had to admit it in the end, \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI do.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>He stared at her and reached his hand for her, but she dodged quickly and slipped behind the screen.</p><br/><p>She leaned out half of her head, revealing a pair of crescent-shaped eyes. Seeing him trying to get up to catch her, she quickly shrank back and ran out of the room like a little fox.</p><br/><p>On the day of 15th, the General of Agile Cavalry celebrated his birthday. The names of Yan Yu and Xie Zhen were written on the invitation.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t want to go at first, but after asking around, she learned that Madam Leng and Xie Xun would be there. So she immediately changed her mind and went with Yan Yu to the general\u2019s estate to congratulate him on his birthday.</p><br/><p>Zhong Kai invited many people, and the general\u2019s mansion was bustling with carriages.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen followed Yan Yu out of the carriage and handed the invitation to the servants at the door. One of them led Yan Yu to the front hall, and the other led Xie Zhen to the backyard.</p><br/><p>There were a lot of women in the backyard, and Xie Zhen only knew few of them. She only met the General\u2019s wife and the old lady, then led the servant maids to sit on a stone bench nearby, waiting for the arrival of mother and Ah Xun.</p><br/><p>The General\u2019s wife Madam Jiang was about the same age of Madam Leng. She looked very amiable, smiling every time she met someone. She did not have the slightest bit of arrogance.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, the old lady appeared to be a bit more serious. She put on a straight face and was a bit difficult to get along with.</p><br/><p>General Zhong and Madam Jiang had five daughters, four of them married, and one of them was a heroine. She fought her way into the enemy\u2019s camp, and no man had ever been able to defeat her.</p><br/><p>Today was General Zhong\u2019s birthday, so all his daughters have gone back home.</p><br/><p>The Madam Jiang had pretty brows, and all of their daughters had good appearances. Each of them had her own beauty.</p><br/><p>Only their fifth daughter, Zhong Rou, had inherited General Zhong\u2019s temperament. Not only did she look similar to him, her eyes were bright with heroic spirit. Her long eyebrows were arched, making her look exactly like a heroic young general.</p><br/><p>The first time Xie Zhen saw her, she thought she saw a man.</p><br/><p>She was dressed in a black suit and was tall, so it was no wonder that she was misunderstood by Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>When Zhong Rou came to the old lady and the General\u2019s wife, she sat down and talked to them. Xie Zhen faintly heard Madam Jiang ask with dissatisfaction, \u201cDidn\u2019t I prepare a set of clothes for you? Why are you wearing all of these clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m used to wearing it,\u201d she replied casually.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not notice the later part of their talk. She saw Madam Leng and Xie Xun coming over, so she quickly stood up and happily stepped forward to welcome them.</p><br/><p>In the central room, after Yan Yu had delivered the birthday present, Zhong Kai personally invited him into the room, leaving a seat for him. \u201cYour Highness, please take a seat.\u201d</p><br/><p>There were many officials in the room, and they all bowed when they saw him.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu arrived early, and neither the crown prince nor the other princes came.</p><br/><p>As Zhong Kai went out to greet the guests, several ministers turned their attention to him, either talking about trivial matters, or talking about the recent events of the court, and then seeing that he was interested, so they did to bother him any more.</p><br/><p>Not long after, people arrived one after another.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu sat at the table, idly listening to the ministers talking about the state of the border, occasionally speaking out his opinions and lowering his head to drink his tea.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t notice the two people who came in through the door.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang led Gao Xun into the room. The two of them took off their waist-length armor and wore ordinary clothes, but they didn\u2019t seem to be very eye-catching.</p><br/><p>One by one, Zhong Shang introduced him to the officials sitting at the table. When he stopped in front of Yan Yu, he heard Zhong Shang say, \u201cThis is the sixth prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu raised his eyes and looked at the two.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

It was always that others were flattering and fawning on him.</p><br/><p>However, after thinking about it carefully, if his father-in-law and mother-in-law were to have a whole new level of respect for him, and if they were willing to let him marry Xie Xun, it wouldn\u2019t matter even if he needed to please them once.</p><br/><p>For Xie Xun, he could give it a try.</p><br/><p>As Zhong Shang sat there and did not speak, Xie Zhen thought that he had withdrawn. She could not help but feel disappointed in her heart, and thought that he was nothing more than mediocre with Ah Xun \u2026 Not long after this thought arose, she saw Zhong Shang holding onto the armrest and standing up again, her peach blossom eyes glanced over indifferently, but her tone of voice was very serious, \u201cIf I, this boorish man, can get your father to approve, can you marry Ah Xun to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, she didn\u2019t call Ah Xun little sister sour anymore, it could be seen that she was still a little serious.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had never understood why he would foolishly pester Ah Xun. Logically speaking, a person like him should have liked women as beautiful as the wind, the snow, the moon, and the enchanting beauty, but why did he have to fall for Ah Xun, who was as innocent as a white rabbit?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen pulled himself back to reality and said ambiguously: \u201cThat will depend on how young master Zhong plans to make father and mother acknowledge him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang was not discouraged, and after making an agreement with her, he planned to immediately take action when he returned to the residence.</p><br/><p>Before he left, he was stopped by Xie Zhen, who purposely added: \u201cYoung Master Zhong, you better hurry up. Father and Mother are already preparing for Ah Xun\u2019s wedding. \u201cIf the people of the Gu family were to ask for marriage before you, then Father and Mother would agree to it. It won\u2019t be a big deal for you then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang froze and his pupils darkened. He quickly decided on a plan and without replying to Xie Zhen, he walked out of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen asked the servant to send him off, he waved his hand and said that there was no need, he had already walked far away.</p><br/><p>After watching Zhong Shang leave, Xie Zhen then held his face and squinted his almond eyes, as he said complacently: \u201cWanting to marry my Ah Xun, is not that easy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu sat by her side, and from start to finish, he did not say a single word. Seeing her make things difficult for Zhong Shang, he actually had the misconception that they were both \u201chusband and wife\u201d. As expected, he was near the end of his tether, and near the end of his tether. He had been led astray by this little bastard.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu took a sip of Jade Spirit Spring and looked at her with a wry smile: \u201cHow can you be sure that he will come again, what if he gives up just like that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen spread out his hands with an expression of \u201cThen that would be the best\u201d, and said, \u201cIt\u2019s good that he didn\u2019t come, I saw that Ah Xun is rather compatible with Young Master Gu, and that my father and mother agreed to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was speechless.</p><br/><p>Returning to the Jade Yard, Xie Zhen did not completely tell the Madam Leng about his conversation with Zhong Shang. He only told him that he had sent him a few apologies, including a brush wash of the Glazed Eagle Lotus Flower and a string of bright Southern Woody Buddha Beads. The Madam Leng was not interested in any of this. He directly asked Xie Zhen if he still had anything else he wanted to say.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen spoke the truth, \u201cHe said that he did not consider Ah Xun in private last time, and this time he specifically came to apologize to Ah Xun. I hope that Mother does not blame Ah Xun, it is all his fault.\u201d With that, he saw that the Madam Leng was in a bad mood, so he added: \u201cBut I did not make him stay for long, I only spoke a few words with him before sending him off.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng sat on the Arhat Bed, frowning with a serious face, \u201cEven if he comes to apologize, I can\u2019t let Ah Xun get back and forth from him \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen secretly grinned, leaning on the Arhat Bed\u2019s embroidered pillow, stroking his stomach, he laughed: \u201cI see, he wants to marry Ah Xun back home \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish his words, Madam Leng shouted, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen raised his eyes, tilted his head and blinked his eyes.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng was just now too excited, he was barely able to calm his mind and calmly said: \u201cI will not agree.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen asked, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she did not really like Zhong Shang, but she was definitely not as repulsed as the Madam Leng. If Zhong Shang could be reborn, after marriage, she would love Ah Xun dearly and advance in her heart and heart, so she wouldn\u2019t oppose it.</p><br/><p>In addition, Zhong Shang\u2019s performance in central room was not bad today, and she helped him salvage quite a few points, so Xie Zhen was quite satisfied.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng took her hand, and after hesitating for a long time, he could not help but say in a melancholy manner: \u201cYou don\u2019t know \u2026 \u2026 I came with General Zhong\u2019s wife a while ago, and General\u2019s wife has been busy searching for a wife for Zhong Shang. From her tone, it seems that she has a preference for a girl with an intelligent mind and a pure heart. Looking at Ah Xun, other than knowing how to eat, what else would he know? I\u2019m worried that won\u2019t be liked by Grandma if he marries her \u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Of course the Madam Leng felt that being able to eat was a blessing, her own daughter felt that it was fine no matter how she looked at it, but she was afraid that others would feel wronged.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not expect it to be because of this reason, and could not help but burst out laughing, laughing so hard that his eyes curved into crescents, \u201cThen when Ah Xun marries into the Gu family, will this mother not be worried?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, the Madam Leng heaved a sigh of relief, \u201cMadam Gu has seen Ah Xun a few times, and her words contained a sense of affection for him. I believe there\u2019s no need to worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was immediately overjoyed, lying on his pillow, laughing so hard he couldn\u2019t stop.</p><br/><p>If Zhong Shang knew the reason, he would definitely puke! His wife hadn\u2019t been married yet, but her mother had already stirred up her.</p><br/><p>But looking at Zhong Shang\u2019s overbearing personality, if he really doted on Ah Xun, even if General\u2019s wife did not like him, as long as he doted on him, no one in the general\u2019s household would dare to make things difficult for Ah Xun.</p><br/><p>After Zhong Shang returned, he sent two people to the Grand Secretariat Gu Palace to keep an eye on the Gu family\u2019s movements. If there was any movement, they had to report back to him. If Gu Yi wanted to communicate with the Xie Clan, he had to tell him as soon as possible!</p><br/><p>Only after settling everything down did he return home.</p><br/><p>In the evening two brothers from the barracks asked him to go out for a drink. He refused and, for the first time, sat in his study for four hours.</p><br/><p>But it had frightened General Zhong!</p><br/><p>General Zhong thought that his son was suddenly enlightened and was about to start reading the Book of Virtue. He immediately ordered that no one was to disturb him, leaving him alone and in peace. Actually, Zhong Shang was not reading a book at all, he was only thinking of a way to please his father-in-law and his mother-in-law.</p><br/><p>He had lived for more than twenty years and had never put in so much effort for anyone.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang crossed his arms, his two long legs resting on the table as he lazily maintained this posture for a long time. He stared out the window at the tree. The flowers flew into the room through the window, some landing on the table, some floating in front of him. He blew lightly with his breath, and the Tong Hua scattered to the sides. One of the pieces landed on the back of his hand, tickling. For some reason, he suddenly thought of Xie Xun.</p><br/><p>When he held her, he always felt an itch in his heart. No matter how hard he tried to scratch her, he just wanted to hold her tighter.</p><br/><p>What was that gluttonous girl doing?</p><br/><p>Did she know that he was so worried about her?</p><br/><p>That little heartless guy probably wants to eat it.</p><br/><p>When they were married, he would buy her whatever she wanted to eat. He would make her round, and it wouldn\u2019t hurt to hold her in his arms.</p><br/><p>Hmm\u2026 Thinking about it this way, it didn\u2019t matter much now. She was his after the wedding anyway, he could love her however he loved her behind closed doors, and he also wanted her to eat something she had never eaten before.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang stayed in the study room until late into the night. servant, under the orders of the general, did not dare to disturb him. servant followed him and asked where he was going. He immediately said, \u201cDon\u2019t follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>So he took a horse from the stable and rode alone in the direction of the West Market.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t come back until nightfall.</p><br/><p>It had been like this for the past two days. He had left before dawn and returned after dark. When he returned, he locked himself in his study and didn\u2019t see anyone. General Zhong asked what was wrong, the servant shook their heads, no one knew.</p><br/><p>On the afternoon of the third day, Zhong Shang had someone bring over the South Sea Guanyin Elephant over from Yunnan. I heard that this famous host had personally shown it to you, and it was extremely effective, so you had to put in a lot of effort to get it done. There was also the newly picked Huomei Peak Tea Leaf this spring. It tasted sweet and mellow, and the aroma of tea was very pleasing to the eyes of the emperor\u2019s masters. Besides this, there was also the Lotus Jade Dressing Jade, the Golden Rat Goose-Eating Flower Hair, and the Twisted Red Lotus Bracelet\u2026 He had clearly asked everyone\u2019s preferences these few days, giving it to them as a gift. That Eyebrow Peak was prepared for the Duke Dingguo, and the red stationery tray was prepared for Xie Liqing. He believed that the two of them would definitely like it.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang instructed the servant to deliver it to everyone tomorrow. servant immediately agreed. He remembered clearly who he should give it to.</p><br/><p>The next day, when servant returned, he asked: \u201cHow was it?\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant said, \u201cI did as Young Master said. I only said that it was a gift from the General\u2019s Estate and did not mention your name. Other than the Second Madam who did not receive the gold coins, the other rooms were all very grateful and delighted. They even said that they would be visiting the general\u2019s estate another day to express their gratitude. \u201d</p><br/><p>The Second Madam was the Madam Leng.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng more or less guessed what he was thinking, which was why he did not stop.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang leaned on the water chestnut door. It seemed that the road to please his mother-in-law was still very long.</p><br/><p>Next, all he needed to do was for Madam Leng to nod his head.</p><br/><p>He looked at the Tong tree in the courtyard and thought for a moment. He suddenly wanted to see Xie Xun, wanted to see her, even if he didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>He was truly possessed.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion was on his guard, like a thief. Even if he wanted to, he would not be able to see it.</p><br/><p>I wonder what the little girl is thinking, is she willing to marry him? Or do you want to marry Gu Yi?</p><br/><p>If he wanted to marry Gu Yi, he didn\u2019t have a chance. After eating his snacks, he would be his man. He would only be able to follow him for the rest of his life, and no one could take it away from him.</p><br/><p>He smirked and went back to his room with his turn around his body, preparing his next step.</p><br/><p>After staying in Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion for the past ten days, Xie Zhen and Yan Yu prepared to go home.</p><br/><p>When the carriage stopped at the entrance of the An Wang\u2019s Mansion, Yan Yu was immediately called away.</p><br/><p>They were people from the crown prince\u2019s household. They said that Yan Tao had urgent matters to attend to and wanted him to make a trip to the crown prince\u2019s mansion right now. After Yan Yu heard this, he leisurely sent Xie Zhen back to Zhanyue Court before he followed that person out.</p><br/><p>Before leaving, he said, \u201cI will be back before dinner. Go inside to sleep for a while, leave one or two servant maids in front of you, if there\u2019s anything you need, get someone to call for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>More and more nagging.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen nodded his head, afraid that he would delay the Crown Prince, and so he urged him to leave: \u201cAlright, you go quickly, I\u2019m fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu looked at her stomach worriedly, telling Shuang Yan to take good care of her before he left.</p><br/><p>Her stomach was now so big that it was shocking to look at, hanging from her slender body. No wonder Yan Yu was worried, he always wanted to follow her closely.</p><br/><p>After Yan Yu left, Xie Zhen went to the inner room to lie down for a while, and unknowingly, he fell asleep. She felt that something was wrong, and raised her voice to call Shuang Yu to come in, \u201cMy stomach is hurting \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu panicked when he heard it. He estimated that the child just happened to be born in the next few days, could it be that he was about to be born?</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu calmed down quickly and said immediately: \u201cI will go and get the midwife. The miss will wait here for a while, Shuang Yan will watch carefully, I will be back soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yan nodded his head.</p><br/><p>Not long after, Shuang Yu invited the midwife. At first, Xie Zhen only felt a slight pain, but the pain became more and more intense. By the time the midwife arrived, she was already covered in sweat. She grabbed the midwife and asked, \u201cAm I going to have a baby?\u201d</p><br/><p>The midwife didn\u2019t dare delay any longer. She walked over to the bed and touched her stomach, breaking open her legs and looking at her. She said gravely, \u201cThe wangfei is about to be born.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen wiped away the sweat on his forehead and said weakly: \u201cGo, go to the crown prince\u2019s mansion and call Yan Yu back \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>How could he not listen when she gave him a baby and it was so painful?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

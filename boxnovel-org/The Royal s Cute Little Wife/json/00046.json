He didn\u2019t have much time left, so he couldn\u2019t afford to waste it all on this.</p><br/><p>He looked at Xie Zhen. \u201cAre you going to come over or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen shook her head and said easily, \u201cYou tell me. I can hear you from here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who cared if she heard or not?</p><br/><p>Was she standing so far away, afraid that he would eat her?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu shook the armrest, stood up abruptly, walked to her, grabbed her hand without any explanation, and pulled her to the side of the chair. \u201cSit down,\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he felt the soft and boneless hand in his palm. He couldn\u2019t help but squeeze lightly, and she shrank back.</p><br/><p>He realized that not only was she younger than him, even her hands were smaller. She hadn\u2019t grown for so many years?</p><br/><p>Why was everything of hers so small?</p><br/><p>After a short time, he finally loosened his grip.</p><br/><p>He sat on the square chair beside him and looked towards the cabinet with virid yarns at the entrance. \u201cDon\u2019t get close to the crown prince in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen moved silently to the other side of the chair and nodded obediently. \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have any objections to that. She didn\u2019t want to have too much contact with the crown prince, especially when she thought of the scented sachet she had embroidered for him. She felt an indescribable awkwardness.</p><br/><p>She only hoped that she wouldn\u2019t meet him in the future and that she wouldn\u2019t live her own life.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s expression eased a little. He coughed and tilted his head, saying, \u201cIn another two months, my mansion built in the Beining Street will be completed. If you have anything you want to buy, just tell me. I will have someone prepare it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he thought for a while and added, \u201cI will bring you there to check it. Everything in the mansion can be arranged according to your wishes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen seemed uninterested and gave a little \u201coh\u201d sound.</p><br/><p>There was nothing more to say.</p><br/><p>There was a moment of silence again. Yan Yu pursed his lips and suddenly turned to look at her: \u201cYou don\u2019t have any requests?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t think much of it, and for a while she didn\u2019t think much about it.</p><br/><p>But since he asked, she wanted to answer him sincerely, so she tilted her head and seriously thought for a moment, \u201cCan I put my bed where the morning sun is?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI like the sun when I get up in the morning. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu wrote it down in his mind, \u201cSure.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her next words completely destroyed his good mood. \u201cHow many rooms are there in the mansion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo I sleep in the side room? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu almost jumped up. He suddenly became angry and asked irritably, \u201cYou want to sleep in the side room?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was shocked by his sudden change of expression, she leaned back in her chair, keeping as far away from him as possible.</p><br/><p>\u201cThen should I sleep in another room?\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t even know what kind of tricks he was playing, how could he suddenly get angry?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s thin lips pursed into a frown, his jaw taut, he spat out word by word, \u201cYou want to sleep in a seperate room from mine?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was stunned. Would it be that she was wrong?</p><br/><p>From the very beginning, she had thought that their marriage was only a formality. She wanted to avoid the crown prince\u2019s entanglement, and it was only because he didn\u2019t have a girl he liked that he came to her side. Since they didn\u2019t like each other, why did he force her to sleep with him?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen remained silent for a moment. \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wouldn\u2019t touch me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu suddenly froze where he was. The expression on his face twitched for a moment, and his anger gradually disappeared. He probably felt like he lifted a rock and smashed his own feet.</p><br/><p>\u201cWho said I would touch you if I slept in the same bed?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf we split up and sleep in separate rooms, wouldn\u2019t it be a joke if word of it got out?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought for a moment that what he said made sense, and not only would he be seen as a joke, but she would also be given trouble by Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll sleep in the side room, anyway,\u201d she conceded. \u201cIt won\u2019t spread too far, because we are in one room.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In short, she had made up her mind not to sleep with him. Yan Yu recognized this reality. It was as if there was a layer of dark clouds above his head; it was dark and heavy.</p><br/><p>However, he couldn\u2019t take back the words he said. Xie Zhen was still regretting his words, so he asked, \u201cYou didn\u2019t say anything, did you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>He gritted his teeth. \u201cI\u2019ll sleep in the side room, you\u2019ll sleep in the inner room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was a little surprised and quickly agreed, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, the matter was settled. Yan Yu prepared to leave in order to save her from saying something that would enrage him again. By then, he didn\u2019t know if he could bear it anymore.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, before he could take two steps, he was grabbed by the back of his sleeve by Xie Zhen. Her strength was very small, and she had some hesitation on her face.</p><br/><p>He stopped, turned around and snappily asked, \u201cWhat else do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen raised her watery eyes, and her thin and white teeth bit into her lips. She asked in a shy tone,\u201d Would you promise me on a few requests?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as Yan Yu heard this, he knew it was not a good thing. Without thinking, he said, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he turned around and continued to walk out.</p><br/><p>He looked down at the small white hand on his sleeve and looked back \u2014 Xie Zhen got up off her chair and looked at him hopefully, her eyes like a fawn\u2019s, making him soften a little.</p><br/><p>He asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen blinked. \u201cYou said last time that you didn\u2019t like someone and had to marry me, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was stunned. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>She asked again, \u201cThen after you have someone you like, can you let me go?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s eyes became cold and he blurted out, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he finished speaking, he met her pitiful gaze and could only change the topic. \u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later.\u201d</p><br/><p>There would be no one there anyway.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was afraid that once she got into his territory, she would be eaten to the bone, and then she would have no way out, so that she would be too miserable.</p><br/><p>\u201cI want to go home once a month.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was better to agree to this request. He would come back with her every month, so Yan Yu nodded. \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>She added, \u201cIn the future, no matter how angry you get, you can\u2019t hit me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou can\u2019t yell at me. \u201d</p><br/><p>When had he hit her?</p><br/><p>When did he yell at her?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s breath caught in his throat as he almost fell over, \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou said you won\u2019t touch me. \u201d</p><br/><p>She was still worried.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu pursed his lips. After a long while, he finally gave a dry grunt of assent.</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t interfere with your life, and you won\u2019t interfere with mine in the future, will you?\u201d</p><br/><p>His face turned black. \u201cYou want to find a man outside?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen blushed and gave him a baffling look. \u201cWhat are you talking?!\u201d</p><br/><p>He gave a slight snort. Wasn\u2019t that what she meant by her words?</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t have the chance even if she wanted it!</p><br/><p>As long as she married him, she would be his woman. Whether they took consummation or not, they could not change this indisputable fact.</p><br/><p>\u201cThis one doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a pause, he turned around and said, \u201cHow can couples not interfere with each other\u2019s lives?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you marry me, you will interfere with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>What nonsense was this?</p><br/><p>But Xie Zhen couldn\u2019t deny it!</p><br/><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu asked, \u201cDo you have any other requests?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNo,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you when I think of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu brushed his sleeves. He was already so angry that he even lost his temper. He said coldly: \u201cThen I\u2019m leaving.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stood there, watching him go. \u201cGo then.\u201d</p><br/><p>He stopped at the door and turned to look at her.</p><br/><p>Her hands were clasped behind her back, and her face finally broke into a smile. She was wearing a goose-yellow blouse made of leno and a blue dress that looked like a ray of sunlight piercing through silk, exuding warmth.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Yan Yu really wanted to hug her.</p><br/><p>When he thought of something, his handsome face reddened unnoticeably. In order to conceal his insanity, he deliberately lowered his voice and said, \u201cCan\u2019t you come over and send me off?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s smile faded. She did not to know what to do. \u201cHow should I send you off?\u201d she asked.</p><br/><p>Her parents and grandparents were standing outside the courtyard. If she went out to send him off, she would definitely be criticized for not being reserved enough.</p><br/><p>She looked at him, embarrassed, and saw that his face was a little red. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu tilted his head, \u201cIt\u2019s too hot, it\u2019s sunny.\u201d</p><br/><p>She did not doubt it, but she forgot that she had heard the words. When they were young, he had answered it the same way, leaning against the wall.</p><br/><p>She stood in the doorway, mulling it over, and chose a more tactful way. \u201cIt\u2019s not noon yet. If you don\u2019t leave, the afternoon sun will be hotter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu ruthlessly exposed her, \u201cYou really want me to leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked up, her long, raised eyelashes flashing and blinking, making his heart itch.</p><br/><p>He really wanted to take her away now. In the future, he would be the only one looking at her.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen shook her head. She was smart. \u201cIf you don\u2019t leave, you can stay for lunch.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWho cares about her lunch?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu opened his mouth several times, wanting to call out her name so that she could hug him. Unfortunately, in the end, he could not allow himself to do so.</p><br/><p>He stepped over the threshold, this time without looking back. \u201cGo back.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long time, Xie Zhen called in Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan, and they walked slowly back to the courtyard.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was waiting in the courtyard for a long time. When she saw her, she rushed towards her with a worried expression. \u201cSis, what did you talk?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid the sixth prince make things difficult for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said no, and took her into the room. \u201cHe said he built a mansion outside and asked me if I want anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>When hearing this, Xie Xun let out an exaggerated sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Ever since she knew that Yan Yu was the sixth prince, she had been worried that her elder sister would be bullied if she married him.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, both she and Xie Rong were not satisfied with this marriage. After all, Yan Yu\u2019s performance as a child was really bad \u2026</p><br/><p>However, the imperial edict was not to be disobeyed. No matter how discontented they were, they could not resist.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen is the wedding?\u201d Xie Xun asked.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said, \u201cThe sixth of October.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun counted with her fingers. \u2018My sister\u2019s birthday is at the end of the year. In that case \u2026\u2019</p><br/><p>She raised her head and asked, \u201cElder sister, you will not be fifteen years old at that time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was stunned. It seemed like it was true.</p><br/><p>After leaving Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, Li Yu did not return to the palace. Instead, he went straight to the sixth prince\u2019s Mansion on Beining Street.</p><br/><p>The mansion had yet to be completed. Only the rough outline and a red lacquered door had been completed. The two stone lions standing before the door were majestic.</p><br/><p>He dismounted and handed the whip to the servant at the door. \u201cShow me around.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servants knew him, took the whip cautiously, and led him inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness, please.\u201d</p><br/><p>With wide strides, he asked as he walked, \u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant replied, \u201cThe central room and the main house are already almost completed. There are still a few small courtyards that they are busy working day and night. The steward has arranged everything according to Your Highness\u2019 instructions.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201d Spring Blossom Castle has reached the completion stage, does Your Highness wish to take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not have the time to take a look and went straight to the point. \u201cBring me to the main house first.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant said yes and quickly led him over.</p><br/><p>The main house was exquisitely built and it took a lot of effort to carve a picture of a building.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu looked at its appearance and was quite satisfied. He then walked straight into the room, \u201cWhere are the inner room and side room?\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant was still confused and did as he was told. \u201cYour highness, please follow me.\u201d</p><br/><p>The house had just been built, and it was empty except for the white walls and the solitary window.</p><br/><p>After walking past the floor cover with flowers and birds carved on it, the servant pointed to the interior and said, \u201cThis is the inner room.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he led him out of the inner room and into another small room. \u201cYour Highness, this is the side room.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at the layout and saw that there was only a wall between the inner and the side rooms, so he said in a flat voice, \u201cOpen these two rooms and put on a door between them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant was puzzled.</p><br/><p>However, he did not intend to explain further. After he finished, he left the main room in satisfaction.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

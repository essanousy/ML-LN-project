Every day, he would accompany Xie Zhen through the long day in summer.</p><br/><p>The one who should be worried was Ping Wang.</p><br/><p>Emperor Yuan Hui had recently begun to entrust matters of the imperial court to the crown prince, and would often have the crown prince stay in the imperial study to review and approve the reports. The officials were all guessing if His Majesty was going to abdicate and allow the crown prince to take over \u2026 It would most likely happen the next year or two.</p><br/><p>The temper of the Ping Wang became more and more irascible, and if he didn\u2019t take it out on the servant at the same time, all of the servant were trembling with fear. They were lucky to be able to hide away for even a day.</p><br/><p>In addition, Lin Rui\u2019s corruption and bribery had been exposed, which happened to fall into the hands of the crown prince. The crown prince was kind and did not take his life, but only changed his position, relegating him to the status of an official. As a mere official of the ninth rank, he wouldn\u2019t be able to cause a ruckus. On the contrary, he would be grateful to the Crown Prince\u2019s kindness.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao\u2019s thoughts were right, from then on, Lin Rui was extremely cautious in government affairs, although his nature was the same, but he became much more obedient.</p><br/><p>When Yan Yun found out that Yan Tao had so blatantly bribed the Ping Wang, he became extremely angry. He did not have much time to wait, and if he were to drag this on any longer, sooner or later, he would give this mountain and river away to someone else.</p><br/><p>The title of Crown Prince had always belonged to him \u2026</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, Yan Yun tightened his grip on the cloud pattern armrest.</p><br/><p>How could he be willing?</p><br/><p>If his mother had not died too early and he was alone, how could he have ended up like this?</p><br/><p>Yan Tao\u2019s luck was just better than his.</p><br/><p>His personality was gentle and not decisive enough. He was simply not a material for becoming a duke, and only he was the most suitable person.</p><br/><p>Thinking about it, Yan Yun stood up, and let his personal attendants deliver a letter to the ministers who were still with him, as he planned his future plans, so that no one would find any clues.</p><br/><p>He had already known a few days ago that the Emperor Yuan Hui had ordered people to monitor him from outside the palace. What he needed to do now was to behave and be his Prince Ping.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, this was not what he wanted.</p><br/><p>Compared to when Yan Yun was preparing for a bloody battle, An Wang\u2019s Mansion seemed to be much happier.</p><br/><p>It was too hot in the sky, so Yan Yu had his men set up a grape arbour at backyard. There was a short bed under the grape arbour, and the bed was covered with bamboo. After the hottest part of the afternoon, Xie Zhen liked to take a nap under the grape arbor. However, she would only eat the grapes that Shuang Yu had washed and read the book at the same time.</p><br/><p>The bed could just accommodate two people, and Yan Yu would occasionally squeeze in, she felt that it was too hot, and wanted to chase him out, but ended up being carried by him in the end. When he woke up, the sun had already set in the west. Yan Yu wrapped her around his arm and casually looked at the book in her hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen yawned and said in a sleepy voice, \u201cJust some small stories \u2026 They talked about a girl who grew up together with her childhood sweetheart. When the two of them reached the age of marriage, they also had similar feelings for each other. Just as they were about to talk about marriage, that girl was suddenly selected by a bully and married into their family as a wife. \u201d After she finished saying all this, her mind became much clearer. She sat up and continued to speak with relish, \u201cEver since Miss married the bully, she has been living a depressed life every day. However, her childhood sweetheart has never married, waiting foolishly for her \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, he saw that Yan Yu\u2019s face was not well: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? You don\u2019t like this story? \u201d</p><br/><p>He threw the book to the side and said in a stiff tone: \u201cNonsense, what\u2019s the meaning of this!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen disagreed, and said while smiling, \u201cI think it\u2019s quite nice to watch, that girl\u2019s bamboo stallion is really a deep lover \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not speak.</p><br/><p>Because he thought of Xie Zhen and Gao Xun. If the two of them could be considered childhood friends, then wouldn\u2019t he be the bully within the book?</p><br/><p>He coldly snorted. So what if you\u2019re a bully? It\u2019s fine as long as you can get your wife in your hands. As for what path you\u2019re using, it\u2019s completely important.</p><br/><p>After thinking it through, he grabbed Xie Zhen\u2019s hand and pressed her onto the bed. He then pulled out a grape from the plate on the square table and fed it to her.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t eat it, and let him skin her before feeding it to her, \u201cHe\u2019s waited for that girl for many years, now there\u2019s no one who is so infatuated!\u201d</p><br/><p>Eating grapes was already such a big deal. Although Yan Yu said that she was troubled, he obediently peeled her skin and fed it into her mouth, \u201cHow many years?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen raised three of his fingers, \u201cThree years!\u201d</p><br/><p>He snorted, \u201cThree years is nothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had waited for her for seven years, from eight to fifteen.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that he didn\u2019t have the nerve to say it.</p><br/><p>It was even harder for him to admit that he had been fond of her since he was a child. In fact, when he was seven or eight years old, his emotions were all muddled. He didn\u2019t know what it meant to be a man and a woman. He only had a good impression and liked to play with this person. Yan Yu didn\u2019t know when he fell for her, but when he was very tired at the palace, he would always think of Xie Zhen\u2019s smiling face. She was always smiling so brightly, as if nothing in the world could defeat her.</p><br/><p>He missed her, so every time he spent time with her, he kept repeating it in his head so many times that he couldn\u2019t forget it even if he wanted to.</p><br/><p>However, when he appeared before her, she actually walked past him without looking at him.</p><br/><p>Back then, he was both furious and resentful. He wished that he could directly ask her if she had really forgotten about him.</p><br/><p>And he did.</p><br/><p>In a flash, a year and a half had passed.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen pushed his head to get him up. The sun was about to set and the courtyard wasn\u2019t that hot either, she wanted to walk around outside the grape arbour.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not move. When he lowered his head, he saw that her hair was loose and her eyes had a look of displeasure, he could not help but think of something. He went close to her ear and asked: \u201cDo you still want to eat grapes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen shook his head, \u201cNot eating, I ate a bit too much today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu had washed two grapes, and she herself had almost finished them all. For this reason, she didn\u2019t even have an appetite for lunch. Just as he finished speaking, Yan Yu grabbed another grape from the side, and said meaningfully: \u201cLet\u2019s try out another method to eat today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was not interested in the beginning, but after hearing what he said, she blinked her eyes and asked: \u201cWhat method of eating in exchange?\u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled, his thin lips sliding down her cheek to hers, and kissed the scream that came out of her mouth.</p><br/><p>Beneath the grape arbor, there was only a mewling sound that sounded like the cry of a cat. Unfortunately, it was blocked by the cabinet with virid yarns, making it impossible to see the interior. Xie Zhen\u2019s voice was thin and soft, as though she was crying, but also sounded like she was begging for forgiveness. \u201cDon\u2019t put it in there\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Fortunately, there were no servant moving around in the backyard. Furthermore, it was getting dark, so everyone was busy preparing dinner in the front courtyard.</p><br/><p>Otherwise, if they were to be overheard, it would not only be a matter of losing face.</p><br/><p>An hour later, Xie Zhen laid in Yan Yu\u2019s embrace weakly, raising his hands to pinch his waist in anger, \u201cYou won\u2019t listen to me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, her hand was weak and didn\u2019t hurt at all when she twisted it. It was more like a kitten scratching its itch.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu pressed his chin against her forehead, and smiled, \u201cWhy am I not obedient?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her cheeks bulged. \u201cI said I don\u2019t want to eat \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Halfway through his words, his face turned red.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu gave a low \u201coh\u201d. It was unknown if he had thickened his skin or what, but he actually said in a sparse and ordinary tone, \u201cBut I like eating. Little Lamb, can we also eat grapes like this next time? \u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, he tied on a belt and helped her up. After tidying up her hair, he looked around and was finally satisfied.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen shook his head like a rattle drum, and quickly refused. I don\u2019t like it! \u201d</p><br/><p>After this experience, Xie Zhen didn\u2019t even dare to stay under the grape arbour to cool down, afraid that he would suddenly have another chance to try again one day. But it was hot, and she had nowhere to go but there, or she was hiding in the house, and in a few days she was bored to death.</p><br/><p>After hearing that the mountain was cool, Yan Yu got someone to buy a courtyard at the foot of Changyu Mountain outside the city. It was located on the shady side of the mountain and blocked by trees. It was a pity that Yan Yu was currently in a forbidden state and couldn\u2019t go out at will. Otherwise, he could bring her along to take shelter for the summer.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen felt very regretful. After making Yan Yu repeatedly promise not to force her to eat the grapes again, she was willing to lie down under the grape arbor. One side was a lake and the other was a willow tree. This summer was quite fast.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>In the barracks.</p><br/><p>Half of the poison in Gao Xun\u2019s body had been cleared, while the other half needed to be treated every day at the clinic by acupuncture to force the poison out of his body.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang wanted to invite the doctor to the army camp so that they wouldn\u2019t have to travel to different places every day. However, Gao Xun rejected it. Leaving the doctor in the army camp would only raise more suspicions, so it would be better for him to head there every day.</p><br/><p>On this day, when Gao Xun left the infirmary, seeing that it was still early, he went to the restaurant at the side and asked for a jug of wine.</p><br/><p>He did not return to the barracks. Instead, he sat by the window and drank.</p><br/><p>The wound on his chest was almost healed, and the doctor said it would be all right to have a drink. However, as he continued to drink, he continued to drink, one cup after another. As he drank, everything before him started to blur. He drank a few more glasses until he had finished the last of the wine in the jug before he stood up and went to the counter to pay the bill.</p><br/><p>Walking out of the restaurant, he found that the streets were bustling with people. Every face was unfamiliar to him. He looked around, but he couldn\u2019t find the person he wanted to see.</p><br/><p>He walked on shakily, as if he had run into a few people. He only nodded in apology, but they didn\u2019t bother with him when they saw his drunkenness. It was only when he bumped into a girl wearing a red dress that the girl frowned and asked, \u201cWhy is it you again?\u201d</p><br/><p>He squinted his eyes. He remembered that Xie Zhen also had a piece of cloth like that, and blurted out: \u201cAh Zhen \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he fell straight towards the side of the road.</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin was shocked, he asked the servant maids to look under his nose, and only after realizing that he was still alive, did he heave a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Recalling the two words that came out of his mouth before he fainted, Lin Huapin couldn\u2019t help but look at him a couple of times. Seeing his mouth open and close as if he was mumbling something, Lin Huapin squatted down to his mouth to listen.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Zhen\u2026 Ah Zhen. \u201d</p><br/><p>This was the only word that came and went.</p><br/><p>She patted his face, \u201cWhich Ah Zhen? Who is Ah Zhen? \u201d</p><br/><p>He scrunched his eyebrows, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin\u2019s eyes lit up, and she quickly calmed down. She turned to the two biddies behind her and said, \u201cCarry him to the carriage and send him to the nearest inn. If anyone else asks, just say that he is my Elder Cousin Roundhouse. \u201d</p><br/><p>Although the biddy was puzzled, he still followed her orders.</p><br/><p>Her father had just been stripped of his position, so his salary naturally fell by leaps and bounds. The days at home were not as comfortable as it used to be. The last time they had met in the infirmary, he had also rudely hit her, but she had not expected him to act like this today. He had drank a lot and even called out Xie Zhen\u2019s name. What was his relationship with Xie Zhen?</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin revealed interest.</p><br/><p>The biddy brought Gao Xun to an inn and gave him a room. He lay on the bed and quickly fell asleep. Without saying anything else, he slept all the way until the next morning.</p><br/><p>When he woke up the next morning, he found himself in a strange room.</p><br/><p>He sat up with a splitting headache. He recalled that he had left the tavern, but he couldn\u2019t remember what had happened after that. He shifted his gaze and saw the girl standing by the round table in the room. He was slightly stunned. \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin walked in front of him, her clear and elegant face revealed a hint of a smile, and she walked to the side of the bed saying with concern: \u201cYou\u2019re finally awake, you suddenly fainted on the street yesterday, and I thought something happened to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun rubbed his glabella, \u201cYou were the one who brought me here?\u201d</p><br/><p>She smiled and nodded.</p><br/><p>There were two servant maids s in the room, and Lin Huapin saw that it gave him a headache. He had servant maids bring out the soup that he had prepared earlier, \u201cDrink this bowl of soup first, it should be more comfortable.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun was alert and strong. Even though he said \u201cthank you\u201d, he did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin sat on the embroidered pier opposite him, and asked while looking at him: \u201cDo you know Ah Zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun looked at her and frowned.</p><br/><p>As long as it was something related to Xie Zhen, he would be very cautious of it. Therefore, when Lin Huapin asked him this question, he subconsciously chose not to answer.</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin seemed to have seen through his thoughts, and smiled lightly: \u201cI am the daughter of the Main Affairs Palace\u2019s Lin Tong who abandoned his wife, Lin Huapin. Before Ah Zhen marries, let us keep up our relationship. You called out Ah Zhen\u2019s name when you were unconscious last night, so I guessed that you two should know each other \u2026 \u201cNow it seems like I was right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun looked at her: \u201cDid I call her by her name?\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence was no different from tacit agreement.</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin smiled and said in an extremely considerate tone, \u201cI only called out once. Yesterday, I sent someone to ask Ah Zhen and she said that you all did know each other. \u201cSince we know each other, it wouldn\u2019t be too much to call out your name after getting drunk.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was trying to smooth things over for Gao Xun.</p><br/><p>Anyone who didn\u2019t know would probably be fooled by her smile, mistaking her for a considerate and gentle girl. They did not know that she had never gone to look for Xie Zhen before, and was not familiar with him either.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he still did not believe her, Lin Huapin took out a hairpin from her bosom. \u201cThis is Ah Zhen\u2019s hairpin, if you do not believe it, you can take it to see.\u201d With that, he paused and looked at him with a hesitant look. His expression revealed that he was hesitating to speak: \u201cAh Zhen found out that you were drunk and was worried that something might have happened to you. He wanted to come over to see you \u2026 I wanted to stop her, but she wouldn\u2019t listen to me and would come no matter what. She should be on her way by now. \u201d</p><br/><p>That hairpin was the Golden Jade Jade hairpin, Gao Xun had seen it before on Xie Zhen\u2019s head.</p><br/><p>He took the hairpin and asked after a while, \u201cIs she coming over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin nodded, \u201cWhy would I lie to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>His arms trembled as he held the hairpin. The light hairpin seemed to be weighing a thousand kilograms.</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin thought that he was just agitated. While he was not paying attention, he smiled, got up and walked out of the room, \u201cI\u2019ll take a look outside, if Ah Zhen comes, I\u2019ll call you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After which, he walked out of the guest room.</p><br/><p>In the guest room at in the porch, Lin Huapin saw that there was no one around and said to the servant maids behind him: \u201cGo and send a letter to An Wang\u2019s Mansion, tell him that Gao Xun is at Qing Ping Inn, and ask the An Wang Fei to come over immediately. If she does not come, then she will not make it in time to see Gao Xun one last time. \u201d</p><br/><p>The servant maids did not understand, \u201cSo what if the An Wang Fei comes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin smiled weirdly, \u201cShe is a dignified An Wang Fei, if someone were to see her being in the same room as other men and receive their gifts privately, there\u2019s no need for us to say anything, her reputation would be ruined. When that time comes, I want to see how An Wang will treat an unfaithful woman. \u201d</p><br/><p>Then he smiled and walked down the stairs.</p><br/><p>As for that hairpin, it actually wasn\u2019t Xie Zhen\u2019s.</p><br/><p>It was just that Lin Huapin had seen Xie Zhen wearing it before, so she was able to create an identical set. It was a pity that she was not as beautiful as Xie Zhen, and from then on, she hid the hairpin in her dowry and did not take it out very often. She was in a great mood. Her family wasn\u2019t well, and she wouldn\u2019t let the Xie family be better off.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen received the servant maids\u2019s order, she was watching Shuang Yu catching dragonflies in the courtyard.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was sleeping in the house.</p><br/><p>servant maids from the front courtyard came to backyard and whispered a few words into her ear. The fan in her hand fell to the ground and she asked in disbelief: \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant maids repeated again, \u201cYoung Noble Gao is about to die at the Clear Peace Inn.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

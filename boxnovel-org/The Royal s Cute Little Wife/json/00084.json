The other party had dozens of acres of land and did business on capital street, whose surname was Wang. The son of the Wang family was recently preparing for this year\u2019s examination, and if he were to pass it, it would be a good thing to bring honor to his ancestors, and if Ouyang Yi was able to marry him, it would definitely be a marriage that would be hard to find. Yan Yu being this kind to her was already the end.</p><br/><p>Today, Shang Yu came to her again and told her that she had found Ouyang Yi\u2019s dowry. It wasn\u2019t Liu family next door who took it, but rather the biddy with light fingers that stole it back home.</p><br/><p>After Ouyang Yi found out the truth, she was so angry that she got someone to find the biddy and beat her up in front of the neighbors.</p><br/><p>After this matter, although the dowry was returned, Ouyang Yi still had a grudge with her neighbor the Liu family. Everyone lived on the same street, where the news would spread very quickly. Everyone said that Ouyang Yi had a bold and fierce personality, she would definitely be in trouble whoever marries her.</p><br/><p>Coincidentally, these words were heard by the Wang family. The son of the Wang family has been studying since childhood and has a gentle personality. Moreover, if he married a brutal woman, wouldn\u2019t that turn the whole family upside down? After some discussion, the Wang family decided to quickly withdraw from this marriage. They also sent back the gifts that steward Zhao had given them.</p><br/><p>Steward Zhao did not tell them that Ouyang Yi was related to the sixth prince, so that the gifts immediately returned to Ouyang Yi\u2019s courtyard.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi was so angry that she immediately scolded the Wang Family. Seeing that, everyone shook their heads.</p><br/><p>Shang Yu treated all of this as a joke and told it to Xie Zhen. After hearing it, Xie Zhen only said it in his heart: Serves you right. If she did not change it, she would not be able to get married for the rest of her life.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, she had signed her name and left with the dowry in her hand. Thus, she no longer had any relations with the sixth prince Palace.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thanked Mammy Wang for her consideration. If not for that paper of contract, she really didn\u2019t know how Ouyang Yi would have messed around.</p><br/><p>A few days later, she heard Shang Yu say that Ouyang Yi and the young son of the Liu family was hooked up. The Liu family did not care about the past, and was willing to marry her, but she refused to admit it.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was a little confused. Why did she not want to marry?</p><br/><p>After staying at home for two days, Xie Zhen decided to go watch the show.</p><br/><p>She had Shang Yu prepare the carriage and bring two servant maids\u2019s two wet nurses and a few guards to the courtyard that Ouyang Yi lived in. Just as they walked out of the residence, they saw a man and a horse parked outside the door.</p><br/><p>Looking up, the handsome young man who immediately wore a deep blue brocade robe was Gao Xun.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was a little surprised, when she walked over she asked: \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun smiled magnanimously as he brought his stallion to a halt, \u201cI heard that Ah Yu went to the border pass, so I came to see you. I don\u2019t know how you\u2019ve been going.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few of the mama recognized him and called him Young Master Gao.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen smiled and said, \u201cI have been doing quite well. I have often come here to visit the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion when I have free time, so if you have time, you can go there too. My mother had said a few days ago that she hadn\u2019t seen you for a long time, and missed you a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused. \u201cI will come to visit my aunt tomorrow after I have prepared something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen nodded.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she was about to leave, he could not help but ask, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought that there was nothing to hide anyway, and since he also knew Ouyang Yi, she explained the whole situation, \u201c\u2026 I was just on my way to see her. \u201d</p><br/><p>When he heard this, he blurted out, \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, when Xie Zhen did not make a sound, he realized that he was being too rash, and immediately coughed to explain: \u201cI heard some news about the border trials in the army, if you are interested, I can tell you as I walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Finished,\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cReally? What news? \u201d</p><br/><p>He mounted his horse and smiled brightly. \u201cLet\u2019s talk on the way.\u201d</p><br/><p>So Xie Zhen happily got in the carriage, and through the curtain she asked Gao Xun: \u201cIs there any news about my father and brother? Are they in good health? Did the construction of the city wall go smoothly? \u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun walked along the road, the majority of them were talking about the situation of the people at the border guards, it had nothing to do with Xie Liqing and his group, and they did not even mention a few words about Yan Yu. Even so, Xie Zhen was still in high spirits. Just thinking about them staying there, even knowing a little bit of information was good.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun accompanied her all the way, and she sat in the carriage as she listened to him talk. After he finished asking his question, she immediately asked him the next question.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun\u2019s voice was not loud, and only the people in the carriage could hear him.</p><br/><p>He was seen sitting on the horse with a grand air, as if he were a guard, and no one paid any attention to him.</p><br/><p>An hour later, they arrived at the entrance of the city.</p><br/><p>The alley was narrow, barely enough for a horse carriage to pass through.</p><br/><p>The coachman drove the carriage inside, with Gao Xun following behind. Ouyang Yi\u2019s courtyard was at the deepest part of the alley. Before he could reach the end, he heard the sound of someone hitting the wall from inside, accompanied by a woman cursing, \u201cYou\u2019re an ignorant fool, you have no parents, it\u2019s your fortune that my son is willing to marry you. We don\u2019t despise you, but you do!\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing the voice, Shang Yu secretly lifted a corner of the curtain and looked in front.</p><br/><p>In front of one of the courtyard doors, there stood a black haired woman wearing a green robe. She looked aggressive, and was pointing at Ouyang Yi\u2019s door and cursing at him.</p><br/><p>There was every single person in this alley, so Xie Zhen was not used to this kind of place in the future.</p><br/><p>The woman cursed for a while and was about to sit at the door to rest when the door opened from the inside and a bucket of dirty water was thrown at her.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi threw the wooden basin on the ground, not losing out to her in the slightest, \u201cDo you think I don\u2019t know what you guys are planning? You want me to marry your son? \u201cPfft, you\u2019re just coveting my wedding!\u201d</p><br/><p>So it turned out that the Liu Family lived next door to Ouyang Yi. They had long heard that she had two boxes containing many good things. A while ago, the Wang Family had returned some things, and when they looked from afar, they could only see the glistening beads underneath the red silk, which they had worked so hard to earn in their entire lives. After some discussion, the Liu family decided to have their son have a secret relationship with Ouyang Yi. Like this, she could only marry into their family, and the betrothal ceremony would naturally go to the Liu family.</p><br/><p>These two clans were entangled with each other, and the families living nearby did not want to interfere. When others saw this, they would avoid them, but no one was willing to help.</p><br/><p>Shang Yu asked around and told Xie Zhen the truth.</p><br/><p>On the other side, the Liu family\u2019s daughter-in-law was dripping with water, and almost started fighting with Ouyang Yi. Xie Zhen sat in the carriage quietly for a moment and said: \u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d</p><br/><p>This was Ouyang Yi\u2019s mess, let her clean it up herself, they won\u2019t bother about it anymore.</p><br/><p>On the way back, Gao Xun also did not speak a word. The two of them silently returned to the prince\u2019s mansion, and when Xie Zhen got off the carriage and prepared to go back, he said: \u201cIf you think it\u2019s troublesome, I can help you handle this matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen turned his head to look at him in astonishment, and quickly shook his head, \u201cThere\u2019s no need \u2026 It has nothing to do with you, last time I signed the contract with Ouyang Yi, from now on her matters are no longer related to me. \u201d</p><br/><p>However, Gao Xun thought that she didn\u2019t want to let him wade through, so she grinned and said, \u201cOriginally, this was just what Ah Yu did not do well enough. He is my brother, it is only right that I help him.\u201d</p><br/><p>No wonder all the elders in the family liked him. His smile was bright and dazzling. Xie Zhen really could not bear to reject him. After hesitating for a while, she nodded and smiled to him: \u201cThen, I\u2019ll be troubling Big Brother Gao Xun.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at her blankly, then turned his head and murmured, \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble.\u201d</p><br/><p>For some reason, Xie Zhen suddenly felt a surge of guilt in his heart. He dragged her and walked towards the manor, and didn\u2019t even invite him to sit inside, \u201cThen I\u2019ll be going back first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun stared at her back until she disappeared behind the shadow wall.</p><br/><p>He always thought that Xie Zhen was his and wouldn\u2019t be able to escape. When did he lose her?</p><br/><p>He curled his lips in bitterness and mounted his horse, returning to the flower bamboo alley.</p><br/><p>A few days later, Gao Xun sent someone over with a message, saying that the problem with Ouyang Yi had been resolved.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi was willing to marry the Liu Family\u2019s youngest son, but she wanted to move out with the Liu Family\u2019s youngest son. She wanted to use Yan Yu\u2019s marriage partner to open a grocery store on another street to make a living.</p><br/><p>After Xie Zhen found out, he sent someone to ask Gao Xun how he managed to persuade him.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun only replied: \u201cShe should no longer want to live her former life of wandering aimlessly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen deeply agreed.</p><br/><p>Humans, it\u2019s fine if she was to live a miserable life, but if she had experienced the hardships of life and also enjoyed the comfort of being served, then it would be impossible for her to return to live a miserable life. Ouyang Yi was just like this. She had suffered all sorts of hardships after following the Madam Li, but after being brought close to the prince\u2019s mansion to enjoy the treatment of having her come and go as she pleased, she would definitely not be willing to suffer.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was very grateful to Gao Xun, and invited him into the palace to treat him well.</p><br/><p>The hall was served by the servant maids and the Senior Servant. The two of them acted magnanimously and occasionally talked about interesting stories from their childhood.</p><br/><p>When he was about to leave, Gao Xun wanted to say something but stopped in her tracks. What did Xie Zhen think of him as?</p><br/><p>Gao Xun dipped his forefinger into the tea water and wrote while saying: \u201cI often hear news of the border trials in the military camp. If you want to know about Uncle\u2019s situation, I can often write and tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen nodded, his eyes staring at the words he wrote, and couldn\u2019t help but be startled.</p><br/><p>He wrote: \u201cThere are people watching outside the residence. Be careful of the people inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s fist slowly tightened under the table, his expression becoming more and more serious. Soon after, he smiled and revealed two simple words, \u201cAlright, if you have any news, please tell me first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun replied, \u201cOf course.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the water on the table dried up, he said goodbye and left.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen ordered his men to remove the dishes, but he had no choice but to consider whether or not the First Prince had spies at home \u2026</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Originally, Yan Yu did not plan to bring so many people along, because it would be bad if there were more people that would be harm to the great tenderness between he and Xie Zhen. However, since Xie Zhen wanted to bring Xie Xun along, he naturally couldn\u2019t say anything else. After arriving at the Mingqiu Lake, it would be the same if he let Xie Xun go.</p><br/><p>It just so happened that Xie Xun was just a piece of small candy, he couldn\u2019t shake her off no matter how hard he tried.</p><br/><p>Wherever they went, she would follow.</p><br/><p>There were people everywhere, and the vicinity of Mingqiu Lake was a sea of people. Looking around, one could see beautiful girls and handsome young men. Yan Yu and Xie Rong sat under a large Tong tree. Seeing Xie Zhen and Xie Xun flying a kite in the distance, Xie Zhen was unable to release the kite no matter how hard he tried.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an did not come. If this were in the past, she would definitely come when she heard about Xie Rong. However, for some unknown reason, he seemed to have suffered some sort of shock recently. He ignored everyone and seemed to be listless and spiritless.</p><br/><p>Although Xie Zhen was not present, he could roughly guess that something happened between her and Xie Rong that day.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had asked Xie Rong before, but Xie Rong did not say anything. He only told her that the princess had sprained her leg, and he helped her take a look, that was all.</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026. Who would believe it!</p><br/><p>However, since Xie Rong was unwilling to say, no matter how capable he was, he was unable to pry a single word out of\u2019s mouth.</p><br/><p>Since she couldn\u2019t care less, she might as well leave it at that.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was lost in thought so he did not notice his feet. servant maids and Xie Xun didn\u2019t have enough time to support her, so she sat on the ground and took a deep breath. When she thought about it, she felt waves of pain from her knees. She was just about to get helped up by Shuang Yu, when she saw Yan Yu anxiously walking over from afar. He bent down and picked her up, and asked with a sullen face: \u201cWhy are you so stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen retorted unhappily, \u201cThe stone is still there. I didn\u2019t see it, how can you blame me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He carried her to the carriage and stared at her without saying a word.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu wanted to examine her wound. He waved for them to go down and prepare some water.</p><br/><p>After servant maids left, Yan Yu stared at her until he could not hold it in anymore, \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen blinked his eyes and nodded, \u201cIt hurts.\u201d</p><br/><p>He squatted in front of her and lifted up her chiffon dress and rolled up his pants. Sure enough, he saw that her knees were red and her skin was torn. He was both pained and angry. \u201cPain and jumping around? \u201cCan\u2019t you just stay put and wait patiently?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen saw that he was obviously very worried, yet had a straight face and wanted to scold her, she suddenly felt that it wasn\u2019t very painful. She giggled and pinched his face, \u201cWhat nonsense did Big Brother Xiao Yu say? Isn\u2019t the purpose of bringing me out today to fly a kite with me? \u201d</p><br/><p>Did she even know that he was the one flying the kite with her?</p><br/><p>From start to end, she stayed with Xie Xun and Zhong Rou, and never even glanced at him.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu poured a cup of water from the bamboo tube and brought it over. Yan Yu supported her leg and helped her clear the gravel on her knee. She shrank back, but he held her legs so tightly that she could not move. \u201d \u201cIt hurts \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After cleaning up, Yan Yu used a clean handkerchief to bandage her up, and then carried her to sit in his embrace, \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>She buried her face in his neck as she sobbed, \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu was fierce towards me, so I\u2019m in pain.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu couldn\u2019t do anything about her, he kissed her on the head, \u201cAm I fierce? Does it still hurt? \u201d As she spoke, she lowered her head and kissed each of her cheeks, nose and eyes. It was both gentle and coquettish.</p><br/><p>She shrank back and raised her face. She didn\u2019t look like she was crying at all. She shook her head slyly and said, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Yan Yu said that she was a little liar, she didn\u2019t care at all.</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>She stood up and jumped around twice to prove that she really was alright, \u201cIt\u2019s just a small wound, how could it be this serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>He spoke softly, as if he had forgotten who was the one crying out in pain.</p><br/><p>Seeing that she was really alright, Yan Yu supported her down from the carriage. Just now, the crowd had only seen her fall. They had only seen her fall heavily, and they had no idea how she was doing. When they saw that she had come out, they all went up to take care of her. She waved her hand and said that she was alright. Only then did everyone heave a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun did not dare to fly a kite with her anymore, and turned to beg Zhong Rou.</p><br/><p>This was exactly what Yan Yu wanted. He got Wu Ze to bring that big cat kite over and flew it for her. Watching from the side, Xie Zhen saw that the kite was flying higher and higher, and could not help but cheer: \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu is so powerful!\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t help but step forward. Yan Yu taught her personally, and out of all the Mingqiu Lake, the two of them were the most conspicuous.</p><br/><p>It was like a pair of people walking out of a painting.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked up at the kite floating in the sky. It seemed that only she and Yan Yu\u2019s kite was flying at its highest speed. Wu Ze handed over a pair of scissors to her, \u201cCut off the thread, we won\u2019t have any misfortune next year.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen took the kite and reluctantly cut the thread. Only when the kite was no longer visible did she say with regret, \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve released such a high kite.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she was a child, she had been flying kites in the yard. There were always trees blocking her path, so she had never flown once.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t care about this when she grew up, so her words weren\u2019t wrong at all.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu said, \u201cI\u2019ll bring you back in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>She suddenly thought of something, \u201cThen do you have to make a kite every year?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say anything, so it could be said that he had tacitly agreed.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen giggled and dragged her down the tree, \u201cIn the future, Big Brother Xiao Yu will no longer be a prince, you can still live by relying on your kite skills.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu stared at her helplessly.</p><br/><p>Beneath the tree, there was only Xie Rong.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang was not there. He felt that it was boring here and went elsewhere to look for fun.</p><br/><p>He rode some distance into the woods, as if he had expected there to be someone there, and when he reached the stream he called out, \u201cHow long are you going to hide?\u201d</p><br/><p>The stream was crystal clear and gurgled. Not long later, Gao Xun rode his horse out.</p><br/><p>He walked downstream along the stream. \u201cI just happened to pass by.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang let out a light ridicule, he was not in a hurry to catch up, and was only wandering around the stream, \u201cAccidental passing by? \u201cHow did you get here from the military camp? Why don\u2019t you teach me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun was thinner than before, his face was darker, the previously spirited and spirited people became silent, even in the face of Zhong Shang\u2019s obvious taunt they did not say a word.</p><br/><p>He came out of the army camp with Gao Xun today.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun said that he wanted to come to Mingqiu Lake, so he casually asked who else. After Zhong Shang told him about it, he only smiled and said nothing. But no matter how Zhong Shang invited him, he was still unwilling to come.</p><br/><p>What else was there to do?</p><br/><p>He had no hope of breaking this relationship. If he wanted to break it off, he could only do it as soon as possible. The longer he dragged it on, the more reluctant he would be to part with it.</p><br/><p>There is a saying that long pain is better than short pain.</p><br/><p>After thinking it through, he tried really hard not to think about Xie Zhen these past few days and searched for more things for himself. At first, it was still useful, but one day, after he saw Xie Zhen\u2019s figure appear in his dreams, he suddenly realized that it was only his own mental paralysis.</p><br/><p>He looked at the girl who was standing in front of Yan Yu and talking sweetly, and couldn\u2019t help but be lost in thought.</p><br/><p>Finally, he hardened his heart and turned his gaze away.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang laughed at him, thinking that he was useless like this, \u201cHow many girls are there in capital? With your identity, are you afraid of not being able to find him? Why must you insist on this one? \u201d</p><br/><p>If he could figure it out, he probably wouldn\u2019t have turned into such a situation today.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even have the face to see Yan Yu now.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun slowly walked forward without saying a word.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang called out to him from behind, \u201cIf you really can\u2019t let him go, then go find something to do. If this goes on, then even I won\u2019t be able to watch \u2026 An Wang Fei just experienced a bit of tribulation, and reunited with An Wang after a long period of separation. There\u2019s really no room for you to intervene. \u201d</p><br/><p>The words were simple and crude, but they were very reasonable.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun suddenly stopped in her tracks, as if she had thought of something.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang was baffled, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>He seemed to have made up his mind and swung his horsewhip as he charged out. \u201cI still have matters to attend to, so I\u2019ll be leaving first!\u201d</p><br/><p>Only Zhong Shang watched as his figure gradually disappeared into the distance.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang sneered, he shook his head and prepared to return.</p><br/><p>After walking a few steps, he saw Xie Xun standing not far away with a rabbit in his arms.</p><br/><p>He stepped forward and asked curiously, \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun held the rabbit in his arms up, letting it see its injured leg, \u201cI just chased after a rabbit, and it\u2019s leg was injured.\u201d With that, he looked in the direction that Gao Xun had left in, his large eyes filled with suspicion, \u201cBig brother Zhong Shang, was that person Big brother Gao Xun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang grinned, \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d</p><br/><p>She asked, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she came over just now, she just happened to see Gao Xun leave, so she didn\u2019t hear their conversation.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang jumped down from his horse and calmly lied to the little girl, \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything, he\u2019s just passing by. Let me ask if you and An Wang Fei are okay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun curved his almond eyes and smiled obediently, \u201csis and I are very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang looked at her smiling face and felt his heart itch. He took the rabbit from her hands and asked, \u201cWhere is it injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rabbit\u2019s hair was grayish black, and only its short tail was white. No wonder Xie Xun caught him eating until he was full.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun walked forward and pointed at one of the rabbit\u2019s hind legs, \u201cIts leg was scratched by a branch.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not a big wound, just a little blood. Zhong Shang didn\u2019t mind as he carried the rabbit to the stream and used water to clean the area around its wounds. He tilted his head and asked Xie Xun, \u201cDo you have a handkerchief with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun immediately took out a s that were embroidered with plum blossoms and asked, \u201cIs this alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>He said yes, and quickly bandaged the rabbit\u2019s hind legs and handed them back to her. \u201cYou like it? \u201cWhy don\u2019t we carry him home.\u201d</p><br/><p>After struggling for a long time, he finally shook his head, \u201cI can\u2019t do it, big brother Zhong Shang should let it go.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had even raised her hand to receive it, so why did she put it down?</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang raised his eyebrows, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy mom is allergic to hair,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cOur family never raised these small animals.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xie Xun was young, she wasn\u2019t very sensible. Seeing other people raising cats and dogs, she wanted to raise him too. The little girl was born with a fondness for cute animals. Madam Leng couldn\u2019t bear to let her down, so he reluctantly agreed to let her raise a little milk cat. was extremely happy, he took the kitten to sleep with him every day, but there was one time the kitten disobeyed him and barged into Madam Leng\u2019s room. Madam Leng was not in the room at the time, and servant maids did not notice it. was so scared that he started to cry loudly. Guiltily, he laid on the ground beside Madam Leng\u2019s bed and said, \u201cMother, don\u2019t die.\u201d</p><br/><p>That day, Xie Xun forced himself not to give the kitten away.</p><br/><p>Since then, she had never had any more small animals.</p><br/><p>After Zhong Shang heard this, he revealed a \u201cso that\u2019s how it is\u201d expression.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun thought that he would let the rabbit go, but he didn\u2019t think that he would actually retract his hands and hold the rabbit in his arms, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want it, I\u2019ll bring it back to take care of you. If you ever think about it, you can go visit the general\u2019s estate anytime you want. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun\u2019s eyes instantly lit up, shining like the morning star. \u201cReally? \u201cDo you want to keep it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang walked in front with the rabbit in one hand and the horse in the other, and laughed: \u201cReally.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was extremely happy, just like how she kept her own small animals. She sincerely said \u201cBig Brother Zhong Shang is really good\u201d, listening to Zhong Shang\u2019s happy mood.</p><br/><p>She gave the rabbit a name on the spot. She wanted to call it Ah Duan.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang asked curiously: \u201cWhy do you need that name?\u201d</p><br/><p>She said, \u201cBecause it has a short tail.\u201d</p><br/><p>The rabbit\u2019s tail was originally short. When Zhong Shang looked at it, he let out a soft laugh.</p><br/><p>She was in high spirits as she discussed with him how to raise rabbits, worried that he would not be able to raise them well. She also said that she would walk around the General\u2019s Estate often in the future so that he wouldn\u2019t raise Ah Duan to death. Zhong Shang was really the same as her. He had never raised any animals, it was already impressive that he could raise himself completely unharmed, let alone raising a rabbit.</p><br/><p>However, looking at the little girl\u2019s happy expression, he felt that he could give it a try.</p><br/><p>After all, it wasn\u2019t a loss.</p><br/><p>Returning outside, servant maids looked for her in a large circle. Only after seeing that she wasn\u2019t injured did he feel at ease.</p><br/><p>The mama thought that Zhong Shang had saved her and thanked him profusely, \u201cThank you, Young Master Zhong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun shook his head like a rattle drum, \u201cI went to chase after a rabbit. Nothing happened.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen pulled her to the side, \u201cThen why are you with him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun looked at Zhong Shang, and was about to say that she saw him together with Gao Xun, but suddenly saw him raise his index finger to his lips, and gesture for her to keep quiet. She didn\u2019t know how to lie, so she could only stutter for a long time before replying, \u201cWe just bumped into each other \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang chuckled as he looked at her.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stroked her head and led her to another side.</p><br/><p>It was not Xie Zhen or, but his past reputation was really not very good.</p><br/><p>Before he joined the army, capital was notorious for being disrespectful, and even General Zhong could not do anything to him. Although he had gradually stepped onto the right path after joining the army, he had the aura of a scoundrel. If he was a cunning big tailed wolf, then Xie Xun would be an innocent little rabbit. Xie Zhen was afraid that he would lead Xie Xun astray, so he didn\u2019t want Xie Xun to get too close to him.</p><br/><p>It was getting late, so it was time to go back.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen and Xie Xun sat in the carriage heading back, while the An Wang\u2019s Mansion and the other servant gradually went further and further away.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang handed Ah Duan to the servant in the manor and reminded him, \u201cBring him back to me so that he can be nurtured properly.</p><br/><p>servant was his personal servant, his name was Li An.</p><br/><p>Li An was puzzled. When did the Young Master take an interest in these small animals? However, he didn\u2019t dare to ask.</p><br/><p>Zhong Rou looked over and asked casually: \u201cWhere did these rabbits come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled and said, \u201cI picked it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Rou looked at the rabbit\u2019s injured hind leg and knew what kind of person his brother was. No matter what kind of creature was in his hands, they would not live past half a month. Do you want me to raise it for you? \u201d</p><br/><p>He actually shook his head and firmly refused, \u201cNo need, I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Rou looked at him suspiciously, and without asking further, he went back to his horse carriage.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Zhong Shang was in a very good mood.</p><br/><p>Late night, Lord Ping\u2019s mansion.</p><br/><p>Recently, when Yan Yun\u2019s temper wasn\u2019t good, even the servant was trembling in fear.</p><br/><p>The palace had recently executed two servant s, and those two had been serving Yan Yun. They had only done a small wrong thing, and did not even have room for mercy, and died from his words. servant didn\u2019t even dare to speak anymore, afraid that doom would befall him, so he had to be even more careful.</p><br/><p>Ever since Yan Yun had his subordinates take care of that servant maids Cui Shan, the Emperor Yuan Hui had ordered people to keep an eye on his every move. He couldn\u2019t do anything these few days, he could only pretend to be a king with a pure heart and little desire.</p><br/><p>Why did the father suspect him?</p><br/><p>Did Sixth Brother say something?</p><br/><p>The more he thought about it, the more uneasy he became.</p><br/><p>He was in a bad mood, so the ones suffering were naturally the people around him.</p><br/><p>Princess Ping had already been taught a few times by him for no reason. Apart from the necessary contacts, she basically wouldn\u2019t provoke him, lest she angered him.</p><br/><p>On this day, Yan Yun was reading in his study, staying until the end of the decade.</p><br/><p>Seeing that it was too late, the servant advised him to go back to his room to rest.</p><br/><p>He stayed a quarter of an hour longer before he got up.</p><br/><p>The in the porch was empty, only the moon above his head was there to accompany him. Tonight was no different from usual. The crickets in the corner began to chirp even louder, one after another. Annoyed by the ruckus, he was about to hurry back to his room when he heard an abnormal sound behind him.</p><br/><p>Something heavy seemed to have landed on the ground.</p><br/><p>The servant holding a lantern paused, \u201cCan you hear anything, Your Highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>He frowned. His voice came from under the wall in front of him. \u201cGo take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>servant agreed as he carefully approached with a lantern in hand.</p><br/><p>Only Yan Yun was left in the the Gallery veranda.</p><br/><p>servant walked to the wall and looked. He held the lantern and looked around, only to realize that it was a dead cat. He cursed and complained, \u201cI wonder which wicked person threw a dead cat into the courtyard. How unlucky!\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she finished speaking, she heard the sounds of fighting coming from the in the porch.</p><br/><p>The servant was shocked and quickly called out \u201cYour Highness\u201d.</p><br/><p>Yan Yun\u2019s left chest received the attack, and was in the process of fighting with the person.</p><br/><p>The person was dressed in black, his face covered by a veil, but his movements were nimble and vigorous. One could tell from one look that he was a practitioner. After exchanging a dozen or so blows with, he realized that his martial arts wasn\u2019t as good as\u2019s, and his chest was injured. He only wanted to delay him, and when the guards of the mansion rush over, he could take him down.</p><br/><p>servant shouted anxiously: \u201cMen, assassins!\u201d</p><br/><p>Realizing that he could not win anymore, the man did not continue fighting and kept his sword as he ran towards backyard.</p><br/><p>Yan Yun wanted to give chase, but the wound on his chest was not light. Supporting himself with the pillar, he spat out a mouthful of blood and pointed at the direction the black-clothed man left in: \u201cChase after this king!\u201d</p><br/><p>servant hurriedly came to help him.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, the guards of the manor rushed over, chasing after backyard.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the man had already climbed over the wall and disappeared into the night.</p><br/><p>Yan Yun was furious, he threatened to capture him, and even if he had to search the entire capital to find this man, he wanted to see who would have the guts to trespass into the Lord Ping\u2019s mansion to commit murder! The palace guards had received orders to search the streets of capital overnight, but unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t find any clues even after searching for an entire night.</p><br/><p>On the other hand, Yan Yun was heavily injured, and his heart meridian was almost injured. After the doctor visited, he expended a lot of effort to stop his bleeding, and even said that his mood should not fluctuate too much, and should be meditated. He also wrote down a few prescriptions so that he could take them according to the instructions written on them.</p><br/><p>Even the night before, he had scolded the servant s of the manor, \u201cA bunch of trash. You don\u2019t even know that someone has barged into the manor, what use do you have!?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

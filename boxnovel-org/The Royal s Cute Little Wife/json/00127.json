However, he was still furious. He sat in the carriage and watched her send Gu Yi out of the mansion. He didn\u2019t know what Madam Leng had said, but she was blushing and looked pretty.</p><br/><p>What did they do through the night? Did you meet? Or said a few words?</p><br/><p>He admitted that he was furious with jealousy and wanted to snatch her on the spot. That sweet smile was his, that soft figure was his, and every move of hers was his. Only he could love her and care about her. Why should Gu Yi do it? Did he like Xie Xun too? Had he kissed her? Did he know how sweet she was?</p><br/><p>He sat in the carriage all night waiting, and all night he did not close his eyes. As long as he closed his eyes, the scene of her and Gu Yi together would automatically appear in front of him. He couldn\u2019t take it anymore, he had tortured himself for the whole night. He had a terrible headache now, but he couldn\u2019t bear to let go of her. He wanted to just swallow her up or tie her up and go home and love her and make her smell like him.</p><br/><p>The little girl was terrified, her face a little pale, her charming voice trembling in his embrace: \u201cBig Brother Zhong Shang?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang rubbed her neck. The beard that grew overnight pricked her delicate skin, making her feel ambiguous and charming. However, he purposely wanted her to feel him, to let her know that she was unable to escape his shackles. \u201cAh Xun, tell me, what did you talk with Gu Yi?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had always been brooding over this problem. Too many things could happen tonight, and if he wasn\u2019t careful, she would be taken away by Gu Yi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun uncomfortably pulled back, but when he placed his hand on her waist, the moment she moved, he tightened his grip. That large hand paused ambiguously between her waist and her buttocks. She was afraid that he would reach down, so even though her eyes were red with anxiety, she did not dare to move again. He didn\u2019t say anything \u2026 I fell asleep when he came yesterday. \u201d</p><br/><p>Although Xie Xun was simple, she was not stupid. Although it was true that there was nothing between her and Gu Yi, she could not speak the truth and provoke him. Who knew if he would do something even more out of line. He just didn\u2019t know why he would appear here \u2026 To even use the name of Big Sister Zhong Rou to meet him, she thought that he must have lied to her. To think that she would foolishly fall for it. What a fool she was.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang didn\u2019t believe her words at all. If she really didn\u2019t speak, why would she personally send Gu Yi out? He took her waist in both hands and put her in his lap. She was so small, she looked like a child in his arms. His breath was hot against her forehead. \u201cLiar.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was stunned, she did not expect to be discovered so quickly, her eyeballs rolled around, and she did not look at him, \u201cWhy is Big Brother Zhong Shang here? Where\u2019s Sister Zhong Rou? \u201d</p><br/><p>He stared at her pink and tender face, and couldn\u2019t help but kiss her nose. \u201cShe didn\u2019t come, I lied to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly honest.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh,\u201d Xie Xun said as she shielded his face, \u201cBig Brother Zhong Shang, don\u2019t be like this. If you have nothing to do with me, I\u2019ll be going back \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s intention was clear enough, she would be a fool if she was not clear. However, she couldn\u2019t say what she felt for him. She didn\u2019t hate his touch, but she didn\u2019t want him to easily get his way.</p><br/><p>It was unknown what words had provoked him, but just as he was about to get off the car, he ruthlessly grabbed back and slammed into his chest. Before he could even react, his mouth was blocked. His strength was a bit too strong. He moved around on her lips a few times, not like kissing, but like a beast biting someone, wanting to tear her apart and eat her into its stomach.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun opened her eyes wide in shock. He took the opportunity while she was lost in thought to nimbly poke his tongue in.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun never knew that the two of them could still stick together like this. He wanted to snatch everything that occupied her, but unfortunately, she didn\u2019t even have a single way out. After a while, she was completely tasted by him. His breath was still on her lips and teeth. Only then did she realize that his body was unbearably hot. Even his breath was hot. She felt as if a fire had rushed into her mouth, burning her whole body.</p><br/><p>There was no longer any sound in the carriage, only the charming sound of lips and tongue colliding.</p><br/><p>The servant maid outside the carriage finally noticed that something was amiss. She wanted to go up and take a look, but she was stopped by Zhong Shang\u2019s bodyguards. Angry and anxious, she called out a few \u201cgirl\u201d to the carriage, but there was no response.</p><br/><p>The servant maid stood outside and occasionally heard the girl\u2019s whimpering. Her voice was soft, like a kitten\u2019s scratching at the bottom of its heart.</p><br/><p>The servant maid was getting more and more anxious!</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t the one sitting inside Miss Zhong Rou? Who was that?</p><br/><p>No one knew how much time had passed before Xie Xun\u2019s lips were completely numb from his gnawing. Then,she leaned over and weakly fell on the couch at the side.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun lifted her sleeves to wipe her mouth. It was all his smell, and her heart was beating wildly, as she didn\u2019t know what she wanted to do. Her almond-shaped eyes were filled with tender spring, and her watery eyes could arouse the affection of others. His first thought was to run, but when he turned his head, he saw that Zhong Shang was lying down with his eyes closed, breathing hard. His handsome eyebrows were tightly knitted, making him look as if he was in extreme pain.</p><br/><p>She remembered the abnormal temperature that he had given her. She stopped for a moment, bit her lip and sat back down. She reached out to touch his forehead. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang was burning so much that he could not even think of leaving, he raised his hand to grab her wrist, \u201cAh Xun, Ah Xun \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun pulled twice, but was unable to pull it back, \u201cWhat are you doing? Let go of me, I\u2019m going back. \u201d</p><br/><p>He opened his eyes with difficulty to look at her, and there was a kind of stubborn insistence in his eyes, which threatened her with words: \u201cYou are not allowed to marry Gu Yi. If you dare to marry him, I will never forgive you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun\u2019s heart was in a panic, he did not know whether it was because of the deep affection in his eyes, or because of the threat he posed, but he hurriedly pushed his hand away and got off the carriage, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to care.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter what it was, his brain must have been burnt!</p><br/><p>She stood up and left, not caring about the fact that he was in a daze due to the fire. She lifted the curtain and jumped off the carriage, grabbing onto the servant maid\u2019s hands as she walked towards the manor, as if there was a ghost chasing after her.</p><br/><p>The servant maid did not understand and stumbled to catch up, \u201cMiss, what\u2019s wrong? What happened? Who was in the carriage? \u201d</p><br/><p>She did not even turn her head, not wanting to answer, but she was afraid that servant maids would speak in front of her, so she calmed down and told her: \u201cIt\u2019s big sister Zhong Rou. She said a few words to me, don\u2019t ask anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant maid felt that something was amiss. If it was Lady Zhong Rou, why did she seem so panicked? Seeing that Xie Xun was not willing to talk about it, he swallowed his suspicions back into his stomach and agreed.</p><br/><p>Walking back to the Jade Yard, she didn\u2019t dare meet the Madam Leng and Xie Liqing. She buried her head in her own room, chasing away all the servant maids inside and outside, and stayed inside the house by herself.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun sat in front of the bronze mirror, looking at herself in the mirror with anger and shame.</p><br/><p>Even her mouth was swollen from Zhong Shang\u2019s bite, who knew where he had gotten so much strength from, how she was going to face him later?</p><br/><p>At the entrance of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, the guards had been waiting outside for a long time not hearing Zhong Shang\u2019s orders, they could not help but raise the curtain and ask: \u201cYoung Master, where do you plan to go next?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang lied there, panting heavily, obviously unconscious.</p><br/><p>The guard was shocked and hurriedly went over to look at his forehead. It was unexpectedly shockingly hot!</p><br/><p>It had rained all night and there was no coals in the wagon to keep him warm. He must have caught the cold, because the fire had struck his heart. Zhong Shang did not usually get sick easily, and his body was extremely healthy. It was precisely because of this that he became sick in his entire life.</p><br/><p>The guard did not dare delay any longer and hurriedly sat back on the carriage, tightly holding the reins, and returned in the direction of the general\u2019s manor.</p><br/><p>Since Zhong Shang had not returned for an entire night, it was inevitable that he and Mrs Liu would ask each other a few questions. Fortunately, they weren\u2019t without examples in the past, so they weren\u2019t suspicious at all. However, when she saw that her son was suffering from such a serious illness, Lady Liu quickly called for a doctor. Her heart ached greatly and she severely punished the guard.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang lied on the bed for an entire day and night. He woke up a few times during that time and quickly fell asleep again.</p><br/><p>He always dreamed of Xie Xun, of how she would obediently call him \u201cBig Brother Zhong Shang\u201d, of how she would personally peel his lotus seed, of how she would pant in his arms while she would turn around and leave \u2026 She was so cruel. He was so sick and she didn\u2019t care about him at all.</p><br/><p>There was an empty spot on his chest, he had never felt depressed before, and the moment he thought about Xie Xun, he felt pain. He had never felt this way before, worrying about a woman\u2019s personal gains and losses.</p><br/><p>How can I get her? He wanted her, and the feeling grew stronger.</p><br/><p>After he recovered, Zhong Shang sat on the bed and thought for the whole day. After two consecutive days of illness, her appearance was a little haggard, no longer as handsome and heroic as before.</p><br/><p>If Mrs Liu knew that her precious son had been tortured like this by a word \u2018love\u2019, who knows how she would feel \u2026 Since Zhong Shang did not tell her about it, he believed he had the ability to resolve the matter between him and Xie Xun. It would not be too late to convince Madam Leng and Xie Liqing then.</p><br/><p>Just as he was thinking, the guard who followed him out last time to be punished, Zhao Quan, walked in and saw no one around him. \u201cYoung Master, the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion\u2019s female servant is going to the Precious Elephant Temple to burn incense today.</p><br/><p>When Zhong Shang heard this, his eyes turned cold, \u201cGu Yi is going?\u201d</p><br/><p>The guard said, \u201cHe will probably send Madam Gu to the top of the mountain.\u201d</p><br/><p>His thin lips curled up in a mocking arc, and his beautiful peach blossom eyes finally had some life, but it was filled with ruthlessness. \u201cPrepare the horse, he dares to steal my woman? I won\u2019t kill him! \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Quan hesitated a little, \u201cBut your body just so happens to be \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He got out of bed and put on the indigo persimmon robe he\u2019d been wearing since he\u2019d woken up. \u201cIt\u2019s all right. It\u2019s better now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhao Quan looked at him. He wanted to say something, but he hesitated. In the end, he still followed his instructions obediently.</p><br/><p>This time, he didn\u2019t let Lady Liu know of his departure. He quietly left the mansion through the back door and headed straight for the Precious Elephant Temple. If the Liu Family found out that he was sick and was about to go out, they would ask around even if they didn\u2019t stop him. He wasn\u2019t in the mood to explain anything now, he just wanted to find Xie Xun and keep her at a distance from Gu Yi!</p><br/><p>The Treasure Elephant Temple was at the top of the mountain about thirty miles outside of the city. It was the largest temple in the capital and was specially used for offering incense and buddhist services to the families of court officials. Therefore, the road up the mountain was especially clean and unobstructed. Not long after Zhong Shang had walked up, he saw the carriages of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion and the Grand Secretariat\u2019s mansion in front of him.</p><br/><p>At least Gu Yi and Xie Rong were walking right in front, and the two of them stood tall and straight, each of them protecting a group of horse carriages. They would occasionally say a few words, and very quickly, they arrived at the top of the mountain.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang slowed his horse\u2019s speed and emotionlessly followed the two families\u2019 carriages, maintaining a distance that was neither too close nor too far. No one in front of him had noticed him. He waited until the Xie and Gu Families had settled down in the temple, then spurred his horse to follow them again.</p><br/><p>Gu Yi was at the door conversing with a host when he turned his head and saw a familiar figure. He greeted in surprise, \u201cChong Yuan also came to offer incense?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang jumped down from the horse\u2019s back, and led the horse over to him. He smirked, \u201cBrother Gu, you\u2019re also like that? \u201cWhat a coincidence.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yi felt that his smile was a little strange, as if he was gritting his teeth when he spoke. But then he thought, maybe he was worrying too much, he and Zhong Shang had no enmity with each other, there was no need for him to be so angry. He cupped his fists and said passionately: \u201cThat\u2019s right, mother and Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion\u2019s Mistress Xie came to the temple together to burn incense and I escorted them here. I never expected to meet them here.\u201d \u201cI have some friendship with the host here. Would Chong Yuan like to stay the night here? Why not I get someone to prepare a room for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang did not reject, \u201cThen thank you very much.\u201d</p><br/><p>He and Gu Yi walked side by side into the backyard of the Precious Elephant Temple. There were not many people along the way, so the two families should be praying for good fortune on top of the Main Hall. Zhong Shang led his horse and casually asked: \u201cIs the Gu family on good terms with the Xie family? \u201cThey even want to come along with this kind of thing that\u2019s just like burning incense.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yi lightly smiled, and replied in a normal manner: \u201cIt\u2019s probably because my mother and Madam Xie are more suited to each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>He coldly snorted in his heart and no longer asked.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s room was very close to Gu Yi. The two rooms were next to each other with only one wall separating them. After Zhong Shang entered the house, he waited inside for two hours before he heard a voice from in front of him. Presumably, the Xie Clan and Gu Clan women who had finished burning incense had returned.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

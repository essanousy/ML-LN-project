If it wasn\u2019t for the servant maids forcefully pulling her away, it was unknown how long she would be crying.</p><br/><p>Mountain Qingyao had the graves of Yan Yu\u2019s adoptive parents, Madam Song and Li Xiqing. Not long after Yan Yu was taken back to the palace, he sent people to search for their corpses.</p><br/><p>At that time, they were all killed on the mountain. By the time their corpses were found, only their bones were left. If it wasn\u2019t for the clothes, it would have been impossible to identify them.</p><br/><p>After Madam Li\u2019s burial, Yan Yu led Xie Zhen out of the carriage and walked towards the two graves in front.</p><br/><p>The two graves was simple and crude. They were just two small mounds of earth. In front of the graves was tombstones with the words \u201cThe Spirit of Li Xiqing\u201d and \u201cThe Spirit of the Li Clan\u2019s Song Jin\u201d on it.</p><br/><p>He took a jug of wine from Supervisor Zhao\u2019s hands and poured three cups each for the two of them on their graves. \u201cFather, mother, forgive me for being unfilial. It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve come to visit you two.\u201d</p><br/><p>He took Xie Zhen\u2019s hand and led her to the grave. \u201cI brought Xie Zhen with me today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stared blankly at the two tombs in front of him. She opened her mouth but couldn\u2019t find the words \u201cAunt Song\u201d.</p><br/><p>Although Yan Yu had told her the whole story before, she still couldn\u2019t accept that the living person in her memories had suddenly appeared in front of her in a different way. As she watched, she suddenly felt that her eyes were sore.</p><br/><p>In her memory, Auntie Song was such a gentle and kind person, why did she pass away in such an unexpected way?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu stood beside her and poured himself a glass of wine. He drank it all in one gulp and said, \u201cWe are married.\u201d</p><br/><p>He spilled the rest of the wine in front of Li Xiqing\u2019s grave and paused for a moment before saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll be nice to her. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen turned her head. Before she could see the expression on his face, he pulled her backward. \u201cThat\u2019s all, let\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had to followed him. \u201cI haven\u2019t spoken to Auntie Song yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>He strode ahead, and from her angle all she could see was a cold profile.</p><br/><p>His thin lips parted slightly. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, he led her towards the carriage parked by the roadside.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen staggered, unable to keep up with the pace, and simply let go of his hand to walk on her own.</p><br/><p>She looked back at the two graves in the distance. There was a newly built mound of earth not far away, standing alone on the mountainside, surrounded by weeds.</p><br/><p>No matter how glorious a person was in his lifetime, he would never escape a pile of dirt after his death.</p><br/><p>When she finished, she turned around and saw Yan Yu staring at her. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without a word, he took her hand and stepped into the carriage.</p><br/><p>The mansion was holding the funeral, so they did not bring many maids with them. Outside the carriage, besides the coachman, was only steward Zhao.</p><br/><p>Steward Zhao had a subtle look on his face. When seeing they come, he wanted to say something, but hesitated. In the end, he did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu helped Xie Zhen into the carriage. When he opened the curtain and saw the person inside, he frowned unhappily. \u201cWhy are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Inside the carriage was none other than Ouyang Yi, who was in garb of unhemmed sackcloth.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi had been sitting inside waiting for a long time. When she heard his question, not only did she feel guilty, but she even replied confidently, \u201cThis is the only carriage. If I wasn\u2019t here, then where should I be?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the way back, she had followed Madame Li\u2019s coffin all the way to Qingyao Mountain. Naturally, she couldn\u2019t return home by walking.</p><br/><p>Therefore, she didn\u2019t need anyone to say anything, and automatically got into Xie Zhen and Yan Yu\u2019s carriage. Steward Zhao had persuaded her not to do this, but she didn\u2019t accept his advice, so he gave up.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu got into the carriage with Xie Zhen and said to her, \u201cIsn\u2019t there another one behind us?\u201d</p><br/><p>She made a fuss. \u201cThat\u2019s the maid\u2019s carriage!\u201d</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t for the tears on her face, just judging from her loud sound, one could not tell that she had just had a family member passed away.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu frowned and subconsciously looked at Xie Zhen, but seeing her normal expression, he was a little relieved, so he didn\u2019t bother with Ouyang Yi anymore.</p><br/><p>The carriage rumbled as it drove along the mountain path, heading slowly towards the foot of the mountain.</p><br/><p>In the carriage, Xie Zhen sat by the curtains, which occasionally obscured Yan Yu\u2019s view from the wind. He wanted to sit closer to her, but Ouyang Yi\u2019s eyes were fixed on them, and he was distracted for no reason.</p><br/><p>The sunlight penetrated through the carriage and sprinkled onto the floor, forming rings of mottled light that swayed as the carriage walked.</p><br/><p>The carriage took on another path. The light tilted, and most of if showered on Xie Zhen, who sat quietly with her eyelids drooping, as if she were asleep.</p><br/><p>The sunlight shined on her face, causing her to appear transparent. If she did not speak, it seemed that she would leave at any moment.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu grabbed her hand and placed his other hand on her head, resting it on his shoulder.</p><br/><p>She moved slightly and he asked, \u201cAre you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>She closed her eyes and made a small sound of agreement.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cThen take a rest and lean on my shoulder.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not answer him, maybe because she was asleep. Her long eyelashes drooped lazily, blocking out her glowing pupils.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu carefully supported her. In order to make her comfortable, he had no choice but to bend his body slightly, not moving at all. This posture was kept for half an hour.</p><br/><p>As Ouyang Yi watched from the other side, her heart was filled with mixed feelings and she couldn\u2019t tell what she was feeling.</p><br/><p>She had never seen her cousin so tolerant of anyone. Whether it was when he was young or now, she had always thought that he had a straight face and was naturally cold and proud, looking down on everyone.</p><br/><p>So it was not that he didn\u2019t like anyone, but he just didn\u2019t like her.</p><br/><p>Where was the coolness he felt when he faced him?</p><br/><p>He had taken Xie Zhen for a fragile treasure.</p><br/><p>But why?</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi couldn\u2019t understand why he would fall in love with him.</p><br/><p>When he was young, it was clearly Xie Zhen who pestered him. He treated Xie Zhen the same way he treated her. Didn\u2019t he like being pestered by others?</p><br/><p>What\u2019s so different about Xie Zhen?</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi watched the two people on the other side for a while, still unable to get the answer.</p><br/><p>The carriage stopped in front of the sixth prince\u2019s mansion. Yan Yu woke up Xie Zhen. The two of them got off the carriage together, leaving her alone in the carriage.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi sat in a daze for a moment before coming down. She stood at the entrance of the mansion. Her mother was gone. Now, she only had Yan Yu left.</p><br/><p>After years of Xie Zhen hounding him, he finally got a crush on her.</p><br/><p>If she was staying with him, would he have been tempted by her?</p><br/><p>A few days before Madame Li was gone, because she wasn\u2019t the sixth prince\u2019s real aunt, Yan Yu only had Changqing\u2019s servants follow her for a few days in mourning.</p><br/><p>Sanson circled the beam for three days.</p><br/><p>Three days later, the servants took off their mourning clothes and went back to their routine days.</p><br/><p>Madame Li was Ouyang Yi\u2019s birth mother. She still had to pay tribute to Madame Li\u2019s filial piety. She wore plain clothes and didn\u2019t wear any emerald beads on her head. Even her meals were light and light.</p><br/><p>Until Yan Yu found a good home for her, she had always lived in the Pavilion Changqing.</p><br/><p>They thought she would not go beyond her bounds, but they were wrong. From time to time, she would come to Zhanyue Court. If Yan Yu was at home, she would pester him, and if Yan Yu was not, she would stir up Xie Zhen\u2019s restlessness.</p><br/><p>It was okay for Yan Yu to be home, she was more or less afraid of him and didn\u2019t dare to be too presumptuous. At most, wherever he went, she would follow him and brazenly ask him when he would take her as a concubine.</p><br/><p>However, if Yan Yu was not here, she would not be so disciplined with Xie Zhen. Sometimes even the servant maids could not bear her.</p><br/><p>Today, she took advantage of Yan Yu\u2019s absence, and came to Xie Zhen\u2019s room again.</p><br/><p>She sat waiting outside, and just as she took two sips of tea, Xie Zhen came out of the inner room, and she looked up just in time to catch a glimpse of the mandarin pearl in her hair.</p><br/><p>The white pearl was round and moist, she knew it was priceless at first glance. Her eyes reddened as she spoke with a sour tone. \u201cPrincess, the hairpin in your hair is really pretty. I think it\u2019s worth quite a bit of money?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t answer it, but ask, \u201cwhat\u2019s the matter with the cousin girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi asked back, \u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, can\u2019t I come and talk to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going out today and I don\u2019t have time to talk to you,\u201d she said bluntly.</p><br/><p>After saying this, she ordered Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan to prepare some things and then walked outside. She said to Hong Mei and Tan Mei standing by the door, \u201cSend the cousin girl back.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as the two of them agreed, Ouyang Yi stood up and said with dissatisfaction, \u201cWhat kind of arrogance are you putting on in front of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you think you can look down on everyone just by marrying my cousin? \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stopped and looked back at her. \u201cWould you say that again?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was true that Xie Zhen needed to go out. She was going back to the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, and she had no time to deal with Ouyang Yi.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was planning to dress up as a boy and follow Zhong Rou to the governor\u2019s mansion. Xie Zhen was worried that something would happen, so she wanted to take advantage of Xie Xun\u2019s absence to take a check.</p><br/><p>This was a bad idea. If it weren\u2019t for Zhong Rou\u2019s repeated promises that nothing would happen, she definitely wouldn\u2019t have agreed to let Xie Xun follow her.</p><br/><p>She was already in a bad mood, and now that Ouyang Yi had provoked her, she was even more unhappy.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi thought that she was striking the very weakness she has, so she raised her eyebrows and proudly said, \u201cAm I wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t your cousin the one who gave you the glory right now?</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t for him, would you be able to wear such good clothes and hairpin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen pointed at her hairpin in her hair, \u201cYou mean this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi was noncommittal.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked to Shuang Yu. \u201cI can\u2019t remember clearly. Tell me, where did this hairpin come from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu bowed and said, \u201cLady, this hairpin was specially made by the Duke Dingguo for your thirteenth birthday and was sent to Qingzhou for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She replied, \u201cNot from the sixth prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu said again, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded and looked at Ouyang Yi. \u201cCousin girl must have made a mistake. I have quite a few pieces of such jewelry in my dowry box. They were all brought from home and have nothing to do with the sixth prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI also have a lot of clothes in my closet. Before I got married, Mother asked someone to make them for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she smiled and said with great understanding, \u201cBy the way, cousin girl , do you really not need my help?\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she measured her up and down with her eyes. There was clearly a delicate smile on her face, but it still made her feel that she was despicable.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi was not dressed very well. This was already her best outfit. She wore a rosebush and a short skirt with a short skirt. After Madame Li died, she only wore this plain colored dress.</p><br/><p>She washed it every day, and the color had long since faded.</p><br/><p>Now that it was mercilessly pointed out by Xie Zhe, she was immediately angered, \u201cYou, you are bullying me too much!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tilted her head and smiled, with craftiness and pride in her smiles. She deliberately said to her, \u201cI was just bullying you. What can you do to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for a response, she turned around and left.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He had grown to be an outstanding man. He was tall and upright, mature and steady.</p><br/><p>In his memory, he had always been silently standing behind his two younger sisters, helping them to clear up all obstacles, watching them grow up without making a sound.</p><br/><p>He was now more unsmiling than ever, and his expression was softer only when he faced Xie Zhen and Xie Xun.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was watching this silently until Xie Zhen came up the steps and threw herself into his arms.</p><br/><p>She had buried herself in his arms and acted coquettish. She was already such a big girl, yet she still had the expression of a child.</p><br/><p>She looked up and said something to him, her eyes full of smiles, soft and sweet, just watching from a distance made one feel warm from the bottom of one\u2019s heart.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu gradually relaxed his grip on the scented sachet. He held it up to her and looked at her while gently stroking the patterns on the scented sachet.</p><br/><p>She had always been half a head taller than him when he was young, but now, it seemed, there was a chance that he would finally have a chance of winning back the match.</p><br/><p>He wondered what expression she would have when she saw him?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu held the reins tightly and wanted to ride his horse closer. After taking two steps, he stopped.</p><br/><p>What should he say when they met?</p><br/><p>How to explain his identity?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t fulfill his promise to take her to the other courtyard to fly a kite, but he didn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Was she waiting for him at that time?</p><br/><p>How long?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu looked at the doors of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion and did not take another step forward.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen followed Xie Rong into the yard, holding Xie Xun\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>She spoke to Xie Xun with a smile. It was too far away to make out the outline of her features, only the sincerity of her smile, as if she had gathered the beauty of the whole spring.</p><br/><p>Why did she come to Beijing?</p><br/><p>And why she became the The fifth girl of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>\uff0c\u3002</p><br/><p>She walked further and further away and could no longer be seen.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu stood in front of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion for a long time, not moving at all.</p><br/><p>As the others passed by, they couldn\u2019t help but give him a curious glance, as if he didn\u2019t notice them.</p><br/><p>It was only when the sun had set at the western border of twilight that he grasped the reins once more, turned his horse around, and left.</p><br/><p>He has not yet built his house outside the palace, and still lives in the palace of the Qing Jia.</p><br/><p>Other than him, there was also the fifth prince and the seventh prince. The other imperial brothers had all built their own homes outside the palace and didn\u2019t stay often in palace.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu lived in the Chenshan compound in the middle of the Qing Jia Palace. When he came back, he had the horses taken back to the stables, and he went to his study and sat all night.</p><br/><p>At night, the young eunuch, Yuan Quan, went in several times to take a look. Yuan Quan found that he had been sitting in the armchair the entire time, without even changing his posture.</p><br/><p>His eyes were focused on the desk, on which was a sachet with mutiple golden threads that must have belonged to a girl.</p><br/><p>Yuan Quan\u2019s eyes went wide. When had his master ever been interested in women\u2019s things?</p><br/><p>This was incredible, could it be that he was about to be enlightened?</p><br/><p>Yuan Quan placed the tea and snacks on the table. \u201cYour Highness, you haven\u2019t eaten anything since you came back. Why don\u2019t you eat some pastries to cover your stomach?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Yan Yu move. He reached out his hand and held the scented sachet in his hand as if it were a treasure, \u201cTake it, I don\u2019t want to eat it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yuan Quan revealed a worried expression. \u201cHow can you not eat \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not reply. It seemed that he was lost in thought again.</p><br/><p>He wondered what was so good about the sachet that\u2019s worth watching all night?</p><br/><p>Yuan Quan sneaked a peek at it. Other than the nice fragrance, there wasn\u2019t anything special about it.</p><br/><p>Yuan Quan couldn\u2019t restrain his curiosity and asked tactfully, \u201cYour Highness, this is \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not speak.</p><br/><p>Yuan Quan mustered up his courage. \u201cIs this a gift from a girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>He abruptly stood up and gave Yuan Quan a scare. Yuan Quan even thought that he was angry.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to kowtow and admit his mistake, he saw him walking out like the wind. He didn\u2019t know where he was going.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not sleep at all. As soon as the sun rose, he went to the Eternal Plain Palace of Princess He Yi\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Inside the Palace, Yan Yao\u2019an had just woken up and was eating alone. When palace maidservant saw him enter, she hurriedly had her maidservants prepare a new set of dishes. \u201cSixth Brother, why are you here so early?\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, she suddenly remembered what he had done yesterday. She spread out her hands in front of him, \u201cGive me back the sachet.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu sat down, his expression unchanged, \u201cI\u2019ve thrown it away.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an immediately infuriated. That was her possession, then what right did he have to throw it away?</p><br/><p>Immediately, he was not allowed to eat her breakfast anymore. She waved him away, \u201cLeave! Don\u2019t let me see you again!\u201d</p><br/><p>She was used to being barbaric since she was young. She was not courteous to anyone, and she had the personality of a tyrant.</p><br/><p>However, Yan Yu sat as still as a mountain, pretending not to hear her, \u201cTomorrow is already Shangsi festival, how are you going to live it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an thought that he was going to change the topic. She snorted and said, \u201cDo you care how I spend?\u201d</p><br/><p>Every year, they would spend time at the palace and wash their hands and handkerchiefs at the water\u2019s edge. It didn\u2019t mean anything at all.</p><br/><p>She wanted to go out of the palace to play, but how could it be so easy?</p><br/><p>Who would take her out?</p><br/><p>As if Yan Yu knew what she was thinking, he lowered his eyes and said, \u201cI have to make a trip out of the palace tomorrow, so I can take you with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was immediately overjoyed. She didn\u2019t even bother about the scented sachet anymore. She stood up and asked, \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Would father agree?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen are we leaving?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu thought for a moment, \u201cTomorrow at 7 a.m. to 9 a.m.\u201d</p><br/><p>He continued: \u201cI will tell father that if we go to offer sacrifices to gods or ancestors, he will not object.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an was simply overjoyed. Her attitude towards him immediately became respectful, and she began to plan her schedule for tomorrow. \u201cSixth Brother, where are we going tomorrow?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had been stifled in the palace for too long, yet he had yet to leave it. It was as if he had been showered with joy.</p><br/><p>In the past, Yan Yu definitely wouldn\u2019t take her with him out of the palace. After all, he was bored, but this time was different.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cI want to visit the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion. You\u2019d better find someone to accompany you. If there\u2019s an accident on the way, I\u2019ll take care of you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since he mentioned Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, Yan Yao\u2019an\u2019s first thought was Xie Zhen. Sure enough, she said, \u201cIf I find someone, will Sixth Brother send someone to protect us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu paused and nodded.</p><br/><p>After the end of the talk, she suddenly thought of something and mysteriously leaned in front of Yan Yu. She winked and asked, \u201cYesterday when I mentioned Xie Xun, why do you have such a big reaction?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes Sixth Brother know her?\u201d</p><br/><p>He tilted his head, half-truthfully saying, \u201cI knew her older brother Xie Rong in my early years, but I haven\u2019t seen him in many years. I wanted to confirm if it was them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an was very easy to get rid of, so she immediately believed him. \u201cThen did you see him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs that them?\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded and said yes.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an smiled and said enthusiastically, \u201cThat\u2019s good. Tomorrow, I will call them out so that you can reminisce about the past.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not speak, but neither did he object.</p><br/><p>On March 3, every household would come to the stream to clear themselves of disease and fight it out.</p><br/><p>Wealthy families would bath with blue soup at home, ordinary families would go to the stream to cleanse themselves, dispel disease and dispel disaster.</p><br/><p>There were also some scholars and nobles who liked to feast and drink in the water.</p><br/><p>Today could be said to be an extraordinarily bustling day. Every household had come to the street, and even the usually impassive ladies also went out to visit the streets.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an had long heard of the things outside the palace, but unfortunately, she had never had the chance to see it for herself.</p><br/><p>Now that His Majesty had granted her permission, and Sixth Brother would bring her along, she could be considered to have made up her mind.</p><br/><p>Early in the morning, without being invited, she automatically tidied up everything and waited in the Yong Ping Palace.</p><br/><p>Before long, the young eunuch Yuan Quan came to summon \u201cPrincess, you may depart.\u201d</p><br/><p>She jumped up and flew out.</p><br/><p>There was a boxwood carriage parked outside the hall. It was Yan Yu\u2019s.</p><br/><p>She did not need anyone to help her. She stepped on the yellow wooden bench onto the horse carriage and happily shouted out, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d</p><br/><p>The carriage slowly drove out of the palace gates, heading in the direction of Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>Arriving at the entrance of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, Yan Yu alighted from the carriage and stood in front of the large, vermilion door for a moment before stepping forward.</p><br/><p>When the doorkeepers learned of their identities, they were alerted to their presence in the central room, and soon the Duke Dingguo and his wife were called in.</p><br/><p>\uff0c\u3002</p><br/><p>The Duke Dingguo did not expect them to come and hurriedly knelt down to pay his respects.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu helped them up and went straight to the point, \u201cIs Second Young Master Xie Rong in?\u201d</p><br/><p>Duke Dingguoo said regretfully, \u201cHe just left.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Princess He Yi heard this, she impatiently asked, \u201cIs the Fifth Miss and the Seventh Miss here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCan you let them out? I\u2019ll take them out for a round.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Duke Dingguo shook his head and replied with the same reason, \u201cReporting to the princess, they\u2019re not in the mansion either. These three children went out together.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cToday is already Shangsi Festival. Rong\u2019er will probably take them to the water\u2019s edge to tread on them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an curled her lips in disappointment, then asked, \u201cThen do you know where they went?\u201d</p><br/><p>The Duke Dingguo hurriedly sent people to the Jade Yard to ask, and shortly afterwards the servants returned to tell them that Xie Rong had taken Xie Zhen and Xie Xun to visit Mingqiu Lake.</p><br/><p>Mingqiu Lake was outside the city. It was a distance of two or three miles from here, so it wasn\u2019t too far. The carriage would arrive in about half an hour.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an thanked him, turned around, and was about to leave for Mingqiu Lake.</p><br/><p>Before she got into the carriage, she asked Yan Yu, \u201cSixth Brother, how about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu said, \u201cSince Xie Rong is there, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an didn\u2019t think too much and happily nodded her head.</p><br/><p>Thus, the two of them sat in the carriage and headed out of the city towards Mingqiu Lake.</p><br/><p>After exiting the city, there were fewer pedestrians. The carriages were very carefree, and coupled with Yan Yao\u2019an\u2019s urging, they arrived even faster than usual.</p><br/><p>Mingqiu Lake\u2019s one side was a mountain and on the other was water. The scenery was beautiful, and it was a good place for treading on green.</p><br/><p>There were many men and women standing by the lake. Half of the women were wearing curtain hat and their faces could not be seen clearly.</p><br/><p>At first glance, it was like looking for a needle in a haystack. There was no sign of Xie Zhen or Xie Xun.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an had never thought that there would be so many people. At this moment, she was dumbfounded. \u201cHow should we find them?\u201d</p><br/><p>She wanted to give up. After all, this was a huge project.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu let her stand there, looked around, then said, \u201cI\u2019ll go look.\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking, he disappeared into the crowd without waiting for Yan Yao\u2019an to object.</p><br/><p>Mingqiu Lake is a good place for sightseeing and sightseeing. Normally, many people would come here, but today, there are even more people.</p><br/><p>There were girls splashing around on the shore, and the laughter was so loud that curtain hat didn\u2019t matter even if the veil was wet.</p><br/><p>No one wanted to miss the only chance of indulgence in the year.</p><br/><p>He walked along the shore of the lake for a while. He met many people on the way, but none of them were the same person he wanted to meet.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to turn back, he heard a delicate voice: \u201cHurry up!\u201d</p><br/><p>He followed the sound and looked forward.</p><br/><p>At a distance from the shore of the lake, near the edge of the woods, beneath a few tall camphor trees, stood a girl in a white silk dress.</p><br/><p>She was wearing a curtain hat, and with one hand she was holding another girl, and a wind was blowing from the woods, lifting the veil in front of her, revealing a smooth chin and slightly raised pink lips.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu turned around. His her dark eyes could only see her.</p><br/><p>There was no doubt about her identity, because on the other side of the carriage was Xie Rong.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stepped forward by holding her dress, and then said cheerfully, \u201cCome with me, Ah Xun.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSlow down, sister. I can\u2019t keep up.\u201d</p><br/><p>She found a fawn in the woods, lying asleep in the grass. She did not disturb him, but she came back and told Xie Xun first, so that her sister could come with her.</p><br/><p>But she only turned her head to look at Xie Xun. She didn\u2019t even know that her curtain hat was hanging from the treetops. With a light pull, the hat fell off her head.</p><br/><p>The servant maid was too late to stop her. In an instant, her black hair flowed out, revealing an incomparably beautiful face.</p><br/><p>Stunned, she was about to bend down and pick up the curtain hat. Yan Yao\u2019an appeared from nowhere and shouted from a distance, \u201d Ah Zhen, Ah Xun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Immediately, everyone\u2019s gazes were attracted over.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked towards the direction of the voice. Yan Yao\u2019an was standing in the crowd, with several guards and palace maidservant behind her, afraid that others wouldn\u2019t know that she was noble.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not expect to meet her here, she was a little surprised, then put the curtain hat back on her head and walked over to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cYao\u2019an, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was standing not far from Yan Yao\u2019an. Xie Zhen walked straight past him without even looking at him.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

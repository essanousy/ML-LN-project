It was a good day for travelling. The Xie Family and the Li Family met at the back gate of the temple. Just as they were about to depart, the Gao Family\u2019s people came over, saying that they wanted to go with them to see the peach blossoms. Madam Xu brought Gao Tongtong, Madam Zhao brought Gao Xun, and a few maidservants followed behind. It seemed that they had come prepared.</p><br/><p>Madam Song was polite. \u201cThe more people, the more lively it will be. Then let\u2019s go together.\u201d</p><br/><p>The garden was not far from the temple, and they were led by a small monk who walked for about a quarter of an hour. The children were rather obedient and didn\u2019t cause any major troubles.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was always by Xie Rong\u2019s side. It was probably because the road down the mountain was not easy to walk. She closely followed Xie Rong. \u201cBig brother, slow down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong was not Li Yu. Xie Zhen told him to slow down, he would be sure to slow down, and sometimes directly carried her along the road. So along the way, the little girl, Xie Zhen, did not put much effort at all. She was the most spirited in her time in the peach orchard, and Xie Xun fell asleep on the nannie\u2019s shoulder instead.</p><br/><p>The peach orchard had a total of tens of mu. Thousands of peach blossoms bloomed at the same time, forming a beautiful scenery in front of everyone\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Peach petals scattered with the wind. From afar, it looked like a pink ocean rising and falling. Waves surged up, bringing with them a strong fragrance of flowers. Xie Zhen came to a peach tree and looked up at the petals above him, perhaps stunned by the spectacle, and stared for a moment.</p><br/><p>A petal floated down from above, spinning and landing on her forehead. The petals were covered with water droplets that had remained from last night, covering her forehead with ice-cold water. She reached out to pick them, and a bit of bright red flower juice was imprinted on the place where the petals fell, like cinnabar that had been intentionally pressed.</p><br/><p>When she smiled and turned her head, the peach blossoms behind her became a foil.</p><br/><p>At such a young age, she already possessed such a beautiful disposition. No wonder Gao Tongtong called her a little fox spirit, it was true. She was not that kind of demure and imposing beauty. She was so beautiful that she was a little bit like a demon.</p><br/><p>Now, she was standing under the Peach Blossom Tree, wearing a white dress. She smiled with her pair of clear eyes and waved at them. \u201cBig brother and mother, quickly come over. The flowers on this tree are very fragrant!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng and Xie Liqing did as they were told. Xie Rong also slowly stepped forward, leaving behind a group of people who were looking at them with infatuation.</p><br/><p>With the Xie family gone \u2026 Each one of them was prettier than the other. It was truly a beautiful painting. God was so unfair that those with good looks had gone to their families.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun stood on the spot, staring at his little fairy. He didn\u2019t even hear Madam Zhao cry out several times.</p><br/><p>Madam Zhao helplessly knocked on his head. \u201cWhat are you thinking about?\u201d \u201cHow many times have I called you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did he regain his senses, reluctantly withdrawing his gaze. \u201cWhat did mother call me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Zhao pointed ahead. \u201cThe little Young Master of the Li family has already been there. Aren\u2019t you going over?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun then saw that Li Yu had come to Xie Zhen, his face turned sideways, there was not much expression on his jade-like face. But Xie Zhen liked him and always talked to him, which made Gao Xun very envious.</p><br/><p>Ever since he had taken them out into the street, but had nearly lost them, he had been ashamed of himself, and he had not had the nerve to look for her. But when he saw her today, he couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer. He walked up to her and mumbled for a long time, then called her name, \u201cAh Zhen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Xie Zhen\u2019s attitude towards him didn\u2019t change at all. She was as friendly as ever. \u201cHmm?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun felt relieved. He only felt that the depression that had been pressing down on his heart for the past few days had completely disappeared. His entire person felt much more relaxed. He said what he had been thinking for a long time, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I almost lost you last time \u2026\u201d \u201cIf something like that happens again in the future, I will definitely protect you well!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had almost forgotten it, but now that he mentioned it, her rosy face instantly turned pale.</p><br/><p>It was not really a beautiful memory, and she would rather not remember it.</p><br/><p>\u201cI mean it!\u201d Gao Xun stopped forward and gave a promise.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen really didn\u2019t want to continue this topic. She quickly thought about it, then suddenly remembered to settle the score with him. \u201cYou clearly promised me to keep it a secret from everyone, so why did you tell big brother Xiaoyu about the hairpin?\u201d</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that she didn\u2019t want Li Yu to know, but she felt that since he had promised her, she shouldn\u2019t tell others.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun suddenly felt he was in the wrong. He looked at Li Yu guiltily. \u201cI \u2026\u201d His gaze was obviously begging Li Yu to speak up for him.</p><br/><p>But as if he didn\u2019t see it, Li Yu turned to look at the luscious peach blossoms behind him, leaving Gao Xun alone to face Xie Zhen\u2019s accusation.</p><br/><p>In the end, Gao Xun was scolded by Little Fairy until his head drooped and he admitted his mistake. Even so, his heart was still happy and willing.</p><br/><p>Gao Tongtong was close to Xie Zhen, and she followed her wherever she went.</p><br/><p>There is a small building in the depths of the peach garden, built with bamboo, all four sides wind, elegant and elegant. A bamboo table was set up in the middle, and even the teacups were made of bamboo tubes. Not only did they not seem to conflict with the surrounding peach trees, they even combined the two colors red and green perfectly.</p><br/><p>The women stopped in the small building to drink tea and talk.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the serving maid brought out several plates of cantaloupe fruits and a peach blossom wine, pouring a small half cup into each of the cups.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng takes a sip, sweet in the mouth, between the teeth seem to contain a piece of fragrant peach blossom, swallow down the stomach, still taste endless.</p><br/><p>Madam Xu also took a sip, but her attention was not on the peach blossom wine, but rather on the outside of the small building. \u201cTongtong really has a good relationship with your daughter\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Not far away, beneath a tree, she saw Gao Tongtong following Xie Xun. Wherever the nannie went with Xie Xun, she followed.</p><br/><p>Those who didn\u2019t know would think that their relationship was really good.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun felt that today Gao Tongtong seems to always follow him, wherever she goes she will go, and she also showed a lot of enthusiasm to him, asking questions and questions.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun didn\u2019t want to answer at all, because she was asking strange questions.</p><br/><p>For example, \u201cWhat are you playing at home?\u201d</p><br/><p>And, \u201cWhat is Xie Rong doing? He went to school and invited Teacher, how did you do your homework? What does he usually like? \u2019</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he ran over to his older brother.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was too young to remember this much, so she quickly lost patience and shook her head like a rattle drum. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Tongtong didn\u2019t lose her patience. \u201cYou tell me this, and I\u2019ll buy you a snack at Ruyi.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun puffed out his cheeks and shook her head firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only God knew how determined she was to refuse the good food for her brother. She was four years old and didn\u2019t know what it was like to hate a person, but she subconsciously rejected Gao Tongtong.</p><br/><p>She wanted to go to Xie Zhen, but after a few steps, she was blocked by Gao Tongtong. \u201cWhat do you want to eat?\u201d he asked with a smile. \u201cI\u2019ll get my servants to buy it for you when I get back. Why don\u2019t you tell me what you like about Xie Zhen and Xie Rong, and I\u2019ll prepare it for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s beautiful eyes were widened, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Tongtong took a deep breath. \u201cIs there anything he doesn\u2019t like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Tongtong finally couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. She bent down and poked her forehead. \u201cHow come you don\u2019t know? That doesn\u2019t know. Are you stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t have much strength left at first, but Xie Xun took a half step back, stepped right on top of a protruding rock, staggered, and sat straight on the ground. Ignoring her, the nannie hurriedly helped her up, dusted off the dirt on her body, and asked worriedly, \u201cWhere does it hurt, Miss?\u201d \u201cDid you fall?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Hun rubbed his buttocks and said it hurts.</p><br/><p>In the small building, Madam Leng and Madam Xu noticed the situation here and immediately got up and rushed over. Leng carried Xie Xun over and asked her what was going on.</p><br/><p>Gao Tongtong rushed in front of her and said, \u201cI was playing with Ah Xun. I only touched her lightly, but she fell over. It\u2019s my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her sincere apology made it hard for the adults to say anything.</p><br/><p>However, Madam Leng\u2019s complexion did not look too good. Her daughter had been through so many mishaps because of her, but she had never been able to develop a good impression of this little girl.</p><br/><p>Due to the presence of the Madam Xu, Madam Leng only said, \u201cIn the future, just pay more attention.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Xu was still reasonable, so she pulled her daughter along to apologize a few times. This matter was over just like that.</p><br/><p>After the adults left, there were only a few children left.</p><br/><p>With Xie Xun and Xie Rong behind him, Xie Zhen\u2019s pretty face was full of anger as she glared at Gao Tongtong. \u201cDid you bully Ah Xun again?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Gao Tongtong admit, \u201cI already said she was not standing steadily on her own, what does that have to do with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun leaned into Xie Rong\u2019s arms and rubbed his neck before saying in a troubled tone, \u201cBig brother, I\u2019m not stupid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong hesitated, then touched the back of her head. \u201cAh Xun is not stupid. Ah Xun is the second cleverest person in our family.\u201d The first, of course, was Xie Zhen. As an older brother, he never argued with them, and then asked, \u201cWho said that about you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Under Xie Rong\u2019s guidance, Xie Xun started to explain what had happened.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong\u2019s face was extremely unsightly. He put her on his lap and stood up to look at Gao Tongtong. \u201cDoes the second miss of Gao Family think you are very smart?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Tongtong, who was still confronting Xie Zhen, didn\u2019t notice what was going on behind her. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong asked again, \u201cSince that\u2019s the case, why can\u2019t you even guess what I like and whether or not my lessons are good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Tongtong was completely dumbfounded as he looked at him, at a loss.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong continued, \u201cIf you want to know more about my situation, you should be kinder to my sister. Otherwise, not only this time, but the next time, and the next time, she won\u2019t tell you.\u201d He looked down and rubbed Xie Xue\u2019s head. \u201cIs it right, Ah Xun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun nodded vigorously, perhaps because she felt that it was not enough, and added: \u201cHmm!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Tongtong, who blushed, could not wait to find a hole in the ground and never come out again.</p><br/><p>When they returned to the Temple of Puyin at noon, Madam Leng had a discussion with Xie Liqing, planning to depart early tomorrow to return to the estate.</p><br/><p>After the temple fasts, all three children were exhausted, and Leng sent them back to their room to rest. She and Xie Liqing were not sleepy, so they laid on their beds and talked for a while.</p><br/><p>After a while, when they were about to fall asleep, the window outside suddenly lit up, and the firelight illuminated the sky.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing stood up and looked out the window. He saw that the source of the fire was coming from the Main Hall. It wasn\u2019t far away, and he could almost hear the crackling of sparks.</p><br/><p>He was shocked. \u201cWhy is the main hall burning?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he went over to take a look.</p><br/><p>Afraid of his impulsiveness, Leng hurriedly put on her clothes and followed him.</p><br/><p>The children were still sleeping soundly. Madam Leng had the maidservants take care of them, so she didn\u2019t need to wake up.</p><br/><p>Not long after Leng and Xie Liqing left, Xie Zhen woke up. She couldn\u2019t find her father and mother, and when she heard Shuang Yu say they were ahead, she noticed a red glow on the horizon. The fire grew stronger, until half the sky was red.</p><br/><p>Most of the people living in the temple had gone off to catch the fire, and neither Madam Song nor Li Xiqing were there. The backyard suddenly became extremely quiet.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was still sleeping and they couldn\u2019t wake her up no matter how hard they tried.</p><br/><p>She was a little afraid by herself, so she didn\u2019t think much of it. She ran to his room, which was the closest to hers.</p><br/><p>Li Yu\u2019s door was tightly shut, and there were no maids outside.</p><br/><p>The door was unlocked, and Xie Zhen pushed it open and stepped inside.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Xiaoyu, are you there?\u201d she asked softly.</p><br/><p>However, just as she entered the inner room, before she could see what was going on inside, a hand came out from behind her back and covered her mouth.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Zhong Shang had done a lot for Xie Xun, but now that his legs could no longer be cured, the Xie Family did not want to be that ungrateful. If Xie Xun was not against it, they could marry Xie Xun into the Zhong Family and take care of his daily life.</p><br/><p>She had discussed this matter with Xie Liqing before. Xie Liqing was an emotion-righteous person who thought about it for a whole night before finally nodding in agreement.</p><br/><p>After Madam Leng told Mrs. Zhong about her thoughts, Mrs. Zhong was shocked. But after she calmed down, she asked a question: \u201cI have something I don\u2019t understand, the day Shang\u2019er saved Miss Ah Xun, logically speaking, he should be training on the drill grounds. Why did he appear at Precious Elephant Temple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng paused for a moment, then smiled with thoughtfully. \u201cIf I\u2019m not wrong, it should be that he followed Ah Xun to be there.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, Zhong Shang\u2019s sudden appearance was indeed shocking, but when she thought about it later on, everything was within reason. Zhong Shang was not at ease and followed her to the Precious Elephant Temple. During this time, he didn\u2019t let anyone find out about it and only appeared when he saw that Xie Xun was in danger. Although his actions were not very proper, but compared to saving Xie Xun\u2019s life, it was not that important.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang liked Xie Xun, so he had secretly met him a lot. She knew about this matter, but Mrs. Zhong might not know about it. Based on Mrs. Zhong\u2019s previous performance, he had probably been kept in the dark.</p><br/><p>\u201cFollow Ah Xun?\u201d Mrs. Zhong was startled, and pretended not to understand: \u201cHe and your daughter \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng laughed and shook her head, \u201cMrs. Zhong, you don\u2019t know about this \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>While walking towards the courtyard, she told Mrs. Zhong everything that had happened in the past few days. It was just that as she said it tactfully, it was hard to say how she disliked Zhong Shang\u2019s way of doing things in the past. Even though it was half real and half fake, it could still be considered as giving Zhong Shang face.</p><br/><p>\u201cIn addition, I have a verbal agreement with the Gu family. In the future, the two families can\u2019t say \u2026\u201d She paused and did not finish her sentence, \u201cThat\u2019s why I have yet to agree with Young Master Zhong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Mrs. Zhong acted as if she had suddenly realized something, \u201cNo wonder Shang\u2019er wanted us to leave. He wants to talk with Ah Xun just now \u2026 Like I said, with his overbearing personality, why did he stop throwing a tantrum when he saw you guys! So you\u2019re deliberately maintaining your demeanor in front of the one you love! \u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng laughed awkwardly, \u201cAh Xun is in the wrong in this matter, I hope Madam does not blame us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Speaking of this Mrs. Zhong, he became depressed, and said with a dejected expression: \u201cWhat does this have to do with Ah Xun? It\u2019s because Shang\u2019er likes her, and willingly gave up a leg for her. He didn\u2019t even complain, what can a mother like me say? \u201d After she finished speaking, she persuaded Madam Leng not to make things difficult for Xie Xun at home. After hesitating for a while, she could not help but say: \u201cSince these two are in love and have suffered a setback today, we should not make things difficult for them \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng had this thought, \u201cWhat I said to Madam just now were true words. After this matter, Master and I understood that Young Master Zhong is a good son-in-law that is hard to come by. If Ah Xun marries to him, I presume she won\u2019t suffer any grievances. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mrs. Zhong\u2019s face finally revealed a happy expression. Just as he was about to speak, he suddenly thought of something.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng muttered to himself, \u201cI have already made my plans, Mrs. Zhong can rest assured.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng was decisive in her actions. Since he had already decided on one matter, he would not drag things out. She and Mrs. Zhong reached an agreement, and after that they chatted about other things before she called Xie Xun to prepare to return home.</p><br/><p>When Xie Xun came out of Zhong Shang\u2019s room, her face was red. They did not know what kind of bad things Zhong Shang had done to her. She pursed her her mouth a thin line and walked to Madam Leng\u2019s side, obediently calling out \u201cMother\u201d.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Zhong looked at her son who was on the bed satisfied. Without even thinking, she knew that this brat must have eaten the girl. She glared at Zhong Shang, and indicated for him to hold back in front of Madam Leng.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Madam Leng didn\u2019t mind and brought Xie Xun home after they finished their goodbyes.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Zhong was also helpless towards this son of his. In order to marry this girl back, he had truly come up with all sorts of shameless methods. It was true that his leg was injured, but it was not at the level of a cripple. The doctor had said that as long as he took proper care of himself and worked hard, he would be able to recover in a year or so. But this brat had already gone out. If he could not marry Xie Xun, he would rather not be able to be good for his entire life.</p><br/><p>As parents, Zhong Kai and Mrs. Zhong, heard this and were naturally anxious and angry. At the same time, they wanted to see what kind of young girls could enchant their son. Mrs. Zhong had seen Xie Xun a few times, but unfortunately, he had never really observed her before. Seeing her today, he could tell that she was a cute, sensible, and obedient girl, and immediately calmed down, afraid that Zhong Shang would be bewitched by some seductive and dissolute woman.</p><br/><p>Since Zhong Shang likes her, then there must be something special about her. Moreover, Zhong Shang had stirred up such a huge commotion for her. If she did not help him marry his wife, the General\u2019s Estate would not have a peaceful day in the future.</p><br/><p>It was just that she felt slightly sorry for the Xie family \u2026 She wondered if they would turn hostile when they found out the truth.</p><br/><p>Returning to the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, Madam Leng did not immediately tell Xie Xun about their conversation. Instead, she asked her what she had talked about with Zhong Shang.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun sat under the lamp, the orange candlelight shining down on her face, like a piece of white jade, without a single blemish. She lowered her head, her long eyelashes pulling out a long shadow, like two butterflies flapping her wings, \u201cBecause of me, Big Brother Zhong Shang suffered injuries, I want to take care of him for the rest of my life \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng was not surprised, and asked calmly: \u201cHave you thought about it?\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded slightly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDo you know who can take care of him for the rest of his life?\u201d</p><br/><p>She acknowledged, \u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t young anymore. In the end, she was already sixteen years old. Some of her decisions were that she could bear the consequences. She knew that she had a good impression of Zhong Shang. Although she was not sure if it was the love of a man and a woman, she did not hate Zhong Shang kissing and touching her, nor did she hate doing intimate things with him \u2026 Maybe she was, but she wasn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>Now that Zhong Shang had saved her, half of her wanted to repay this kindness, and the other half \u2026 It\u2019s because she wants to be with Big Brother Zhong Shang. Even if his legs are crippled, she wouldn\u2019t mind him.</p><br/><p>Did she like him?</p><br/><p>If that\u2019s the case, she rather liked Big Brother Zhong Shang.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng did not ask further. Since she had already decided, these two questions were enough. Madam Leng passed on the conversation she had with Mrs. Zhong to her, \u201c\u2026 For the marriage between you and Zhong Shang, Father and Mother will make the decision for you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was stunned, she never thought that the marriage would come so quickly. She thought that her mother would definitely object, who knew that both she and her father would agree to it? They won\u2019t let her marry Gu Yi? She was at a loss for words. \u201cWhy is Mother \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng rubbed her head and hugged her to her chest, \u201cWe can\u2019t repay the Zhong Family\u2019s kindness. Ah Xun\u2026 As long as you don\u2019t regret it later on. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun groaned from within her embrace, and when she heard the unwillingness of Madam Leng, she reached out to hug her and comforted her, \u201cI don\u2019t regret it \u2026 Mother, I will not regret this. \u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng let out a long sigh but did not say anything.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun felt her forehead become wet, and two water drops fell down. She wanted to look up, but Madam Leng had already released her, and stood up: \u201cI\u2019ll go tell your father, tell him what we should do about this marriage.\u201d He turned and walked out of the house.</p><br/><p>The reason why Madam Leng felt sad was because her daughter had to take care of a handicapped person for the rest of her life. Although the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion could help, the water still could not save the fire in the end, so she had to go taste the flavor herself. If she didn\u2019t marry, then she would be ungrateful. Furthermore, the two of them had the same feelings for each other. Since things had gotten to this point, why would she be a bad person to break up their marriage?</p><br/><p>The marriage between the Xie Clan and the Zhong Clan was decided, and it was settled very quickly. The marriage proposal, the exchange of seven words of invitation, the selection of eight words, and the selection of a candidate had all been completed in a mere half a month. The wedding date was set for the eighth day of the next month. The date was always a bit rushed and many things had to be prepared in a hurry, but fortunately, there were a lot of people from the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion and the general\u2019s household who were well-prepared and did not miss anything.</p><br/><p>The people of the capital knew that in order to save the seven ladies of the Xie Clan, Young Master Zhong had put his left leg in. In order to repay the Xie Clan\u2019s gratitude, they had married the seven young miss to their next of kin. After this matter spread, the commoners raised their thumbs and praised it as a good marriage. A perfect match made in heaven. It was as if he had forgotten Zhong Shang\u2019s past.</p><br/><p>In the two months before their marriage, Xie Xun was at home learning from Madam Leng about rules and accounts. Furthermore, since Madam Leng insisted on not allowing the two of them to meet before the wedding, for the entire two months, she had not seen Zhong Shang once.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was very tired and peaceful every day. After washing up at night, she would immediately fall asleep on her pillow without thinking about anything else. Zhong Shang was currently a \u201ccripple\u201d, of course he wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to go to Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion to look for her. While he was busy recuperating every day, he also had time to think about what that greedy little cat was doing.</p><br/><p>Did she miss him? How many times a day? How much did she miss him?</p><br/><p>After working so hard for so long, he finally managed to get married with her.</p><br/><p>He could already stand up and walk, but he couldn\u2019t walk for too long. At most, he would be able to stop and rest in fifteen minutes. This was a good sign. The doctor said he was not far from a complete recovery.</p><br/><p>Finally, it was the eighth day of the fifth month. Early in the morning, the house was bustling with noise as the firecrackers and firecrackers rang incessantly. The windows and doors were plastered with red letters, and the atmosphere was joyous everywhere. Zhong Shang\u2019s legs were inconvenient, it was inconvenient to ride a horse to escort the bride. He originally wanted to look for his brothers from the clan to greet him, but no matter what, he wouldn\u2019t agree to it.</p><br/><p>He had to do it himself, of course! What did letting someone else replace him mean? Was Xie Xun going to marry him or marry someone else?</p><br/><p>He definitely wouldn\u2019t allow it.</p><br/><p>In the end, they could not resist him, and so they brought him on horseback, and he rode all the way to the entrance of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion. When the match maker carried Hua Guang on his back, Xie Xun, who was dressed in a red wedding gown, looked at the bride with his eyes. When someone urged him to do so, he reluctantly retracted his gaze and returned to the General\u2019s Estate with his reins clenched tightly.</p><br/><p>In fact, with Zhong Shang\u2019s current situation, standing in front of the wedding would not be a problem for him. However, in order to prevent Xie Xun and the Xie Family from becoming suspicious, he could only sit in the wheelchair and lead Xie Xun to the front hall with the red silk end. The newbie knelt in front of their parents, paid their respects to Heaven and Earth, and then to each other. After the ceremony, the people around helped Zhong Shang to sit back in his wheelchair and sent him to the bridal room.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun\u2019s line of sight was blocked from seeing her surroundings; she only felt that it was very lively, and that there was a huge commotion everywhere. She had heard so many of these sounds today that her ears buzzed, and she didn\u2019t feel any better until she arrived at the new house. The door closed, isolating the clamorous noise outside. Other than the silence, it was also a bit unsettling.</p><br/><p>There were a total of more than ten women in the Zhong Family with the young masters and mistresses added together. They all told Zhong Shang to lift Xie Xun\u2019s head cover.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang held onto a golden rod, slowly lifting up the golden cover on Xie Xun\u2019s head, his gaze focused on something that he had never done before: \u201cAh Xun \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun opened her face today and applied a thin layer of makeup. Her skin was already fair and clean, and under her eyes, she looked like an egg with its shell cut off. Her cheeks were smooth, her lips were red and her teeth were white. She was already intoxicated before she even had a taste.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang watched until he could not move a step, and was then laughed at by a group of female members: \u201cLittle Young Master, stop looking at it, it\u2019s time to drink a cup of wine!\u201d</p><br/><p>match maker handed over two cups of cross-cupped wine, one for each person and one for each person. After that, he twisted a strand of their hair into a knot and placed it in a sandalwood box.</p><br/><p>After the ceremony, Zhong Shang still had to go in front to deal with the guests. He pushed his wheelchair and walked slowly, turning his head three times in a single step, worriedly exhorting, \u201cAh Xun is shy, you guys are not allowed to tease her!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s second young mistress laughed heartily, \u201cLook at your precious appearance, you\u2019ve only just gotten married and you can\u2019t bear to part with me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang scoffed on the surface, then left.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun suddenly had to face so many relatives of Zhong Shang, hence he was a little afraid of the stage. Zhong Shang\u2019s sisters were all satisfied with her, so they stayed back to accompany her. They teased and teased unrestrainedly in front of Zhong Shang, but they took care of her and didn\u2019t make things difficult for her.</p><br/><p>It was just that other than Zhong Rou, they were already married, and the topics of their discussion were rather erotic. After Xie Xun listened for a while, her face flushed red.</p><br/><p>This one said she would hurt for the first time and told her not to be afraid. That one told her not to be shy and that she should experience it more often in the future. Xie Xun thought of the many times that Zhong Shang had looked at her, just like how Second Sister Zhong said, she was like a wolf and tiger, forever unable to satisfy her hunger.</p><br/><p>They would also, like the picture books, be entangled in a myriad of strange positions \u2014 at least?</p><br/><p>Xie Xun did not dare think about it anymore. Her ears turned completely red, and in the end, Zhong Rou helped her out, \u201cAh Xun has just gotten married. Second sister third sister said all this too early.</p><br/><p>Zhong Qing smiled flirtatiously. \u201cFrom what I see, Fifth Brother is infatuated with his wife. I\u2019m afraid that it won\u2019t even take a few days for you to understand everything.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was fortunate that he did not continue after saying this. They saw that Xie Xun had been tired for the entire day, so they did not disturb him too much, and let her rest for a while, and change her clothes to eat something.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was indeed very tired. He was caught in bed before the sun rose and busied himself for an entire day without eating anything.</p><br/><p>After everyone had left one after another, she took off her thick and heavy wedding dress, let servant maid take off her phoenix coronet, and changed into a light and light ordinary set of clothes. By the end of spring, the weather was getting hotter and hotter, and he could not wear much clothes at night. She wore a charming red bra with scattered flowers and a plain cover. The fabric was thin, and one could vaguely see the scenery inside. This was what Xie Zhen had prepared for her before marriage. He was sure that Zhong Shang would like this very much since she had worn it for him. But she stood in front of the bronze mirror and looked. What is this? Just as she was about to change out, she heard footsteps from outside. Shuangying came in and said, \u201cMiss, Young Master is back!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun\u2019s hand trembled, so fast? Didn\u2019t second sister say that she would return late with him?</p><br/><p>It would definitely be too late to change clothes now. Xie Xun quickly picked up a piece of Xiang Fei\u2019s colorful flower pattern and bird pattern Beizi and put it on. Just as he heaved a sigh of relief, Zhong Shang came in from the outside.</p><br/><p>He was still seated in his wheelchair, but when he was pushed in, he kept staring at her, causing her to feel guilty.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang waved his hands and ordered everyone to leave, not even her two accompanying servant maid s stayed behind. He looked like he had drunk a lot, and his expression was still normal. However, his eyes were not clear. He squinted his eyes a few times, and finally saw her clearly.</p><br/><p>He pushed his wheelchair slowly towards her, \u201cAh Xun \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he neared step by step, Xie Xun couldn\u2019t help but retreat step by step. \u201cShe didn\u2019t know why, but that look in her eyes frightened her. She felt as if she had nowhere to run in front of him.\u201d How are you? I asked servant maid to boil some wine, do you want to drink a little? \u201d</p><br/><p>Then, regardless of whether he agreed or not, she went around him to call someone over, \u201cShuangying \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he passed by, he was grabbed by the wrist!</p><br/><p>His hands were very hot, and the heat from his body\u2019s heat spread across her body made her shiver uncontrollably. Her voice became soft, \u201cBig Brother Zhong Shang\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As if he hadn\u2019t heard her, he held her hand and separated her slender fingers from his. He gave a profound smile, \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid, alcohol is good stuff sometimes. And I didn\u2019t drink too much. I was thinking about you, so how can I stay with those guys forever? \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun bit her lower lip, \u201c\u2026 \u201cOh.\u201d After a pause, he asked, \u201cThen are you hungry? Do you want to eat something? Are you sleepy? Let me get someone to help you change? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang raised his head and asked her: \u201cWhat is there to eat?\u201d</p><br/><p>She thought very seriously, \u201cShuangying said that there\u2019s nothing much to eat right now. But they can make a bowl of wonton or Pork Noodle Soup, which one do you want to eat \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head. \u201cNone of them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then there was nothing left to do. It was already late, and the fire on the kitchen counter had gone out. It would take some effort to get more people to do it. Xie Xun was somewhat vexed, \u201cThen what do we do\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang crooked his lips into a smile, supporting his chin with his hands, he examined her sad little expression, no matter how he looked at it. He had seen enough, so he wrapped his arms around her waist and placed her on his lap and whispered into her ear, \u201cAh Xun, I want to eat you, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun shrunk. Her ears itched, but he buried his head deeply and didn\u2019t raise his head for a long time. After waiting for a long time, she stammered, \u201cI-I\u2019m not good to eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had a faint idea of what Zhong Shang meant. The big sisters of the Zhong Family had told her just now that men loved women and they loved each other. Just thinking about it made her feel extremely embarrassed. However, it was impossible to escape. Every married bride had to go through this sort of thing.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is it not tasty?\u201d Zhong Shang lowered his head, bit her small ear and exhaled into her ear. \u201cBig brother Zhong Shang has tried it before, it\u2019s delicious and sweet everywhere, sweet to the point that my teeth hurt.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun moaned and hid to the side, \u201cNonsense \u2026\u201d Her ears were completely red, going all the way down to her neck. A thought flashed through her mind, and she finally thought of something, \u201cBut, but isn\u2019t Big Brother Zhong Shang\u2019s legs are bad? \u201cHow can this be \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang replied with an \u201coh\u201d sound, then gave a meaningful smile, \u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even if his left leg was truly crippled, doing that would not be a problem. Furthermore, his legs were still as good as new. If he wanted to pick her up, there wouldn\u2019t be any problems at all.</p><br/><p>The scented sachet is secretly dissolved, and the ribbons are lightly separated.</p><br/><p>The huge dragon and phoenix candle in the new room had been burning for the entire night without extinguishing. The bed curtain was shaking, and the end of it was unknown.</p><br/><p>biddy who was checking outside heard for a while and knew the situation inside was intense. He returned in satisfaction to report to Mrs. Zhong. Leaving behind the two servant maid s who were on guard duty, he listened to the story from the corner of the wall all night long. Young Mistress\u2019 voice was soft and gentle.</p><br/><p>The two of them flushed so red that blood almost dripped onto the ground. The young madam\u2019s delicate and timid voice begged for forgiveness, \u201cBig Brother Zhong Shang, the light \u2026 Turn off the lights\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Oh, the young master is such a bully, he actually didn\u2019t turn off the lights. Two gigantic, arm-piercing candles lit up the room, but they couldn\u2019t see anything? It was no wonder that the young madam was feeling both wronged and embarrassed.</p><br/><p>The young master continued: \u201cAh Xun, be good. If I turn off the lights, I can\u2019t see you clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t look at me, wuu wuu \u2026 You\u2019re not allowed to look \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The sound continued until dawn arrived and the first rays of the morning sun gradually appeared in the east. Only then did the young mistress stop crying. It was unknown whether it was because he had fainted, or because he had been tormented to the point where he had no strength left. After waiting for another hour, Zhong Shang called them in, and they finally carried the hot water towel in.</p><br/><p>The smell in the room was so strong that they didn\u2019t dare to look at it. They just stood there, well-behaved in front of them, waiting for orders.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang stood up, put on clothes, washed his own mouth, and said: \u201cIt\u2019s still early, let Young Mistress sleep for another hour. You are not allowed to call her. Tell me when she wakes up. \u201d</p><br/><p>Saying so, he tied up his gold-striped belt and went out to the yard to practice martial arts.</p><br/><p>He had tormented Xie Xun the whole night, and now he was brimming with energy, refreshed and energetic.</p><br/><p>This morning, they still had to go to the front courtyard to offer tea to their parents. Xie Xun did not dare to sleep too late, and immediately opened her eyes when the sun rose. However, she was too tired from last night, and her hands and feet were aching. She sat up a few times but still couldn\u2019t get up, and in the end it was the servant maid who helped her up.</p><br/><p>She grumbled a few times in her heart at Zhong Shang, not daring to look at the scars on her body. After putting on her clothes, she sat in front of the dressing table, let servant maid comb a bun, and chose an emerald golden jade hairpin to wear on her head. After asking the time, she found out that there was still a quarter of an hour left until morning. \u201cWhere\u2019s brother Zhong Shang?\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant maid looked out of the window, \u201cYoung Master is practicing martial arts outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Practicing martial arts</p><br/><p>Just with his legs?</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was suspicious for a moment, he stood up and walked towards the window. The window frame was wide open, through the window frame, one could see the courtyard holding onto the snake spear, a young man in high spirits, isn\u2019t that Zhong Shang?</p><br/><p>When did his leg heal?</p><br/><p>Xie Xun stared blankly into space for a while, before finally waking up from her stupor. She had lost her left leg, and could no longer walk for the rest of her life, all because of Zhong Shang\u2019s lies! No wonder she felt something was amiss last night. He was so energetic and didn\u2019t like to be a man whose left leg was cripple. So, he actually \u2026 Xie Xun suddenly felt a wave of anger. She had felt guilty for him for so long, this big liar!</p><br/><p>Xie Xun stared angrily at Zhong Shang\u2019s back until Zhong Shang turned around and met her gaze. He smiled and asked: \u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun didn\u2019t answer and just closed the window in front of him with a bang.</p><br/><p>Big Brother Zhong Shang was a big liar, she doesn\u2019t care about him anymore!</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He thought of women as a kind of thing, a pleasure to amuse oneself by idling away the time.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, his father and uncles were both generals, and the women in his family were all very fierce. They would make a small move when they were arguing with others, and make a big move when they were fighting with others, to the point where no one dared to provoke them. For example, his three elder sisters who had married had his brothers-in-law completely subservient towards them. In front of these three brother-in-law, they didn\u2019t even have the right to speak \u2026 As for fourth sister, who was not married off, there was no need to talk about that. After changing into her military uniform, she was like a man, and was much stronger than him.</p><br/><p>Was this a woman? Are all women this rude?</p><br/><p>Only when he was twelve or thirteen did he come to understand the difference between men and women, and realize that not all women were like the ones at home. Women were supposed to be gentle, sentimental, and delicate, rather than fighting and killing all day.</p><br/><p>At one point, he liked to watch women playing zither and embroidering songs, thinking that this was the normal thing a woman should do. Later on, he felt that she was too pretentious. Weak women often cried, and if she looked at him too much, she wouldn\u2019t be as pleasing to his eyes as his elder sister.</p><br/><p>Later on, he would rather drink with a group of foppish young masters than go to the Qin Residence and provoke women.</p><br/><p>Of course, all of these were prior to meeting Xie Xun.</p><br/><p>The first time he saw her, he did not have much of a throbbing heart. He just felt that this girl was cute, as clean as a spring. Her words were soft and sweet, making him feel very comfortable. At that time, he thought she was someone Gao Xun had his eyes on, so he didn\u2019t dare to provoke her.</p><br/><p>She and Gao Xun were innocent, the one Gao Xun liked was her sister.</p><br/><p>At that moment, he didn\u2019t know why he let out a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Then, when there was a feast at home, she didn\u2019t fall into the water at all. I heard that it was fourth sister who saved her. The water was cold in the early spring, and she warmed up on the spot. A girl was always more delicate than a man. A fever was unavoidable. He thought that she would definitely burst into tears, or at least act coquettishly. He didn\u2019t expect that even if she became dazed from the fever, she would only secretly wipe her tears on Mammy\u2019s back. She didn\u2019t want to worry her parents, so she didn\u2019t complain at all.</p><br/><p>This really made him look at her in a different light.</p><br/><p>She seemed to be different from other girls. Other girls liked to dress up and wear clothes and jewelry, but only she liked to eat. When the fourth sister told him to buy refreshments on the street, he probably brought them in front of her and teased her. The longing in his eyes when he looked at her really made him look like a greedy little cat.</p><br/><p>She attracted his attention without having to do anything.</p><br/><p>It was said that the Xie Family\u2019s fifth girl and seventh girl were born beautiful, especially the fifth girl. However, he felt that Xie Xun was more pleasing to the eye than Xie Zhen. Every time she looked at him with her clear and watery eyes, he could not help but want to bully her.</p><br/><p>He thought that their relationship was good enough, and treated her like a little rabbit, just like the rabbit he picked up from the Mingqiu Lake\u2019s side that day. He forgot that B.Rabbit also had a temper and could get angry, so when she said \u201cI hate Big Brother Zhong Shang\u201d in anger, he was actually a bit helpless.</p><br/><p>Should he be coaxed? How should he be coaxed?</p><br/><p>He had never coaxed a woman before and had thought that she would be fine in two days if he left her alone. Who would have thought that two days later, news would spread that she was going to be engaged to Gu Yi!</p><br/><p>Only then did he realize that his feelings for this little girl were not simple.</p><br/><p>That night, he did the most disdainful thing he had ever done. He barged into her room, impatient to know what had happened from her.</p><br/><p>Knowing that there was still room for manoeuvre, he could not help but heave a long sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>He held her shoulders, and under the light her face was so smooth and exquisite that it tickled his heart. He could not help but peck her on the cheek. \u201cDon\u2019t marry him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was so scared that she did not even react when he kissed her cheek. After reacting to his words, he hurriedly pushed him away, \u201cHurry up and leave, you\u2019ll be seen by others!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he was unwilling, Zhong Shang still reluctantly walked away.</p><br/><p>Since then, Xie Xun had been avoiding him and ignored his invitation. Even when he was about to go to the Orchid Tomb to battle, she did not ask anyone to say a single word. In the end, it was only because he couldn\u2019t hold it in and came looking for her that she could barely come out to meet him.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, the little girl had the heart, so she gave him a Talisman before she left. He was wearing it on his body, maybe because of the Talisman s, he managed to escape from the blade a few times. He walked under the gates of hell a few times, and when he returned to capital, he missed her a lot. Gao Xun left. He was too sad that he forgot to buy her a special product of Orchid Mountain Range. After returning home, he could only use the Cream Pancake as a substitute. It was a pity that her mother found out before he had even said a few words \u2026</p><br/><p>He pondered for a few days, then went back to Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion to pay a visit. Who would have thought that Xie Zhen would force them into a corner at the last moment and ask them to marry Xie Xun.</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026. He wanted to marry Xie Xun, and bring her home. No matter how he kissed her at night, he didn\u2019t need to worry about being discovered by others, he wanted to give her all the delicious food under the heavens, and wanted to raise her into a white and fat woman.</p><br/><p>As long as the people from Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion didn\u2019t agree, he could forget about getting involved with Xie Xun at all.</p><br/><p>If he did not immediately make his father-in-law and mother-in-law happy, he could only watch as Xie Xun married someone else in the future.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, even if Zhong Shang used all of his strength, Madam Leng still did not have any good impressions of him.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s so good about Gu Yi?</p><br/><p>Both of Zhong Shang\u2019s legs rested on the table, as he thought about the words that Xie Zhen had praised Gu Yi for being \u201cknowledgeable and courteous\u201d. Wasn\u2019t he just a scholar? He had seen this kind of man before, but at the most critical moments, women still liked boorish men like him!</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang decided to meet Gu Yi.</p><br/><p>Instead of riding a horse, he rode on a horse carriage and arrived at the entrance of Grand Secretariat Gu Palace, just in time to see Gu Yi leading a jujube red stallion as she prepared to go out. Zhong Shang sat in the horse carriage and used a jade fan to raise a corner of the curtain. He looked at Gu Yi who was wearing a blue robe and a faint smile appeared on his lips.</p><br/><p>Want to steal his wife? It\u2019s eight hundred years early!</p><br/><p>Without warning, Zhong Shang got off the horse carriage and blocked Gu Yi\u2019s path. He cupped his fists and smiled, \u201cBrother Gu, where are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Caught off guard, Gu Yi took a step back and bowed. \u201cSo it\u2019s Brother Chong Yuan.\u201d</p><br/><p>Chong Yuan was Zhong Shang\u2019s form of address. Normally, people would not call him that, because he was born in the army, everyone liked to call him Little General. Thus, hearing such a sudden exclamation made him somewhat uncomfortable.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s lips curved into a smile that was not a smile, the jade fan in her hand turned around, and pointed at the entrance of the Grand Secretariat\u2019s mansion: \u201cYou want to go out? \u201cUnfortunately, I was planning to visit your house.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yi, of course, asked, \u201cI wonder why Chong Yuan is looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>He made an \u2018oh\u2019 sound and said indifferently, \u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I just heard that Brother Gu\u2019s painting is really impressive and I wanted to ask you for some advice.\u201d With that, she curled her lips, and her smile suddenly became ambiguous, \u201cI fell in love with a girl and wanted to make a painting to make her happy.\u201d</p><br/><p>That day when he barged into Xie Xun\u2019s room, he saw the painting on her wall. His heart felt like it had been knocked over. There were all kinds of flavors, and most of them were filled with jealousy. He was clearly burning with jealousy, yet he still had to maintain his poise in front of Xie Xun.</p><br/><p>He wanted Xie Xun to take off the painting, but he didn\u2019t have a proper reason for doing so. Now that he had met Gu Yi, he was enlightened and temporarily asked Xie Xun to teach him how to make a painting.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s fame was spread far and wide, so when Gu Yi heard his words, he didn\u2019t think too much about it and only said with a guilty look on his face, \u201cBrother Chong Yuan, it\u2019s not the right time for you to come. I\u2019ve made an appointment to go out with someone, so I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t teach you today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang casually asked: \u201cBrother Gu, who do you have an appointment with?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Yi was magnanimous and answered frankly, \u201cI made an appointment with the eldest son of the Xie Clan to borrow a few books from my predecessors. If you aren\u2019t in a hurry, come back tomorrow. I\u2019ll be at home all day tomorrow. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s eyes darkened, \u201cXie Rong?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were many Xie Clan members in capital, but the only family that had a reputation was the Xie Clan known as the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>Gu Yi nodded. \u201cExactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression immediately turned ugly. Gu Yi going to the Xie Clan was simply borrowing books? Would he meet with Xie Xun? Was this arranged by the Madam Leng for them to meet each other?</p><br/><p>Seeing that he did not say anything, Gu Yi saw that it was almost time to negotiate, so he cupped his fists and said, \u201cSorry about that.\u201d He then mounted his horse and rode towards the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion. Zhong Shang clenched his fists and quickly regained his senses. Gritting his teeth, he jumped onto the carriage and said to the guard driving the horse: Go to Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion!</p><br/><p>The guard already knew what his young master was thinking and he didn\u2019t dare delay any further. He turned around and followed behind Gu Yi, arriving at Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>But at the door he stopped again.</p><br/><p>With what identity did he enter? What was he doing in there?</p><br/><p>Madam Leng already had dislike so if he rashly barged in again, she would only be unhappy. At that time, the date to marry Xie Xun would be even more distant.</p><br/><p>He still had this little bit of self-awareness, before Madam Leng recognized him, he had better be honest and not act rashly.</p><br/><p>What should he do? Should he just leave?</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t do it.</p><br/><p>He clearly knew that Gu Yi and Xie Xun were in the same courtyard, and that the two families had intentionally brought them together, but he couldn\u2019t just ignore them. The smile on Zhong Shang\u2019s lips had already disappeared, her thin lips were pursed into a line, as she held her jade fan and returned to the carriage. He would wait here and see when Gu Yi would come out.</p><br/><p>After waiting for a while with his eyes closed, his heart was a mess. He ordered the guards outside, \u201cGo in and see if he and Seventh Miss have met.\u201d</p><br/><p>The bodyguard had the ability to run away, it would not be difficult for him to enter the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>Before long, the guard returned and reported outside the carriage, \u201cMr. Gu has been in Eldest Young Master Xie\u2019s courtyard the entire time and has not come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>He felt slightly more at ease.</p><br/><p>However, the sky gradually turned dark and Yi Yi didn\u2019t come out.</p><br/><p>In the evening, it started to drizzle. The rain hit the roof of the carriage and made a crisp \u201cding ding-dong\u201d sound. The sky darkened at once and a bolt of lightning flashed. Soon after, there was a loud explosion from the horizon. The rain got heavier and heavier, as if a basin had been poured over it.</p><br/><p>For the third time, the guard went in to investigate. When he returned, he said, \u201cYoung Master, Second Master Xie and Second Madam Xie said that the rain is too heavy, so it\u2019s not convenient for us to return now. They have to keep Mr. Gu at their residence for the night.\u201d</p><br/><p>The veins on Zhong Shang\u2019s forehead popped out, and the hand that was holding onto the jade fan tightened and tightened. In the end, he couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore and threw the fan far away.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He was wearing a black coat, so it was not obvious, but the blood that flowed from the horse\u2019s back to the ground proved how serious his injury was. His face was pale as he tightly held onto the wound on his chest: \u201cLet\u2019s go back!\u201d</p><br/><p>One of them wanted to help him up, but he dodged it.</p><br/><p>The group turned back the way they had come. With the First Prince\u2019s men chasing them from behind, no one dared to relax as they galloped back to Lanling City. Others were more or less lightly injured, but none of them had suffered as much as Gao Xun. He stared straight ahead and held his breath as he rode the horse through the moat. When he reached the gate, he leaned over, closed his eyes and finally fell off the horse.</p><br/><p>\u201cChiliarch Gao!\u201d</p><br/><p>The instant he closed his eyes, he seemed to hear Xie Zhen calling his name by his ear.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Gao Xun?\u201d</p><br/><p>The voice was so soft and sweet that it made his heart pound.</p><br/><p>He remembered the first time they met. That was in his yard, when she turned her head with a smile, and her cheeks were soft and clear. At that time, he thought, even the little fairy in the painting wouldn\u2019t be as beautiful as her \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMy name is Ah Zhen.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve heard all that you\u2019ve said. Have you heard anything else?\u201d</p><br/><p>He told her funny stories just to see more of her smiling face. In the blink of an eye, twelve years had passed, from the age of seven to nineteen. At that time, Little Fairy had become the wife of another, and it no longer had anything to do with him.</p><br/><p>She advised him to look for other girls.</p><br/><p>But he only wanted her alone \u2026</p><br/><p>Gao Xun\u2019s whole body was in pain, but his heart still throbbed in pain. He had had this problem ever since he came to Orchid Mountain Range. Thinking about Xie Zhen made his heart ache, he had to spend a lot of energy everyday in order to not think about Xie Zhen. He thought that he would be able to let go of her and find a virtuous and gentle girl to spend the rest of his life with, just as she had said. If he couldn\u2019t do it now, he might not be able to do it in the future.</p><br/><p>His eyes were moist and his throat was sweet. He tilted his head and spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>When Gao Xun was sent back to the army camp, he only had one last breath left.</p><br/><p>There were two fatal injuries on his body, one on his chest and one on his neck. He was clearly unconscious and did not even have the strength to speak, yet his hands were tightly clutching the blueprints he had obtained from the First Prince. When the soldiers carried him back to the tent, Zhong Shang was fidgeting inside, walking back and forth.</p><br/><p>When he opened the tent, his pupils suddenly shrank when he saw Gao Xun.</p><br/><p>The Military Doctor followed behind him. He did not have time to report the situation to, and immediately followed him to the bedside to treat Gao Xun\u2019s wounds. But where else would there be a good place? His entire body was riddled with holes, and blood kept oozing out. He couldn\u2019t even block it.</p><br/><p>The two military doctors hastily pulled out arrows for him to stop bleeding. Although the injuries on their arms and legs were healed, they didn\u2019t dare to recklessly move the arrows on their chest and neck.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang regained his senses, grabbed a soldier by the side and asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? How did he get so injured? \u201d</p><br/><p>His brows were cold and filled with rage.</p><br/><p>The soldier kneeled down and recounted the scene from before to Gao Xun. However, the moment they saw Gao Xun, he was already injured to this extent. At that time, with the First Prince\u2019s troops chasing them from behind, they had no choice but to take the small path to avoid them. The other party had pursued them relentlessly, only stopping when they were three miles away from the moat.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang smashed his fist fiercely on the table and said to the two doctors: \u201cSave him, no matter what, we must save him!\u201d</p><br/><p>The military doctor wiped his sweat, not daring to say a single word.</p><br/><p>The two arrows that were stuck in Gao Xun\u2019s chest and neck had only cut off the tail, and the arrows were still stuck in his flesh, not daring to be easily pulled out. Come out. If he did \u2026 If he couldn\u2019t stop the bleeding after coming out, then he wouldn\u2019t be able to save his life \u2026</p><br/><p>The arrow wounds on their chest were very close to their hearts. It took the two military doctors two hours to pull out the arrow. Come out and stop the bleeding. The wound on his neck was more difficult to treat. The doctor\u2019s hand trembled when he pulled out the arrow, and it seemed to have touched a blood vessel on the side. The blood flowed non-stop and soon dyed the mattress under his body red.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun\u2019s face was pale white, like a dead man.</p><br/><p>The Military Doctor knelt on the ground and kowtowed to Zhong Shang as he begged for forgiveness, \u201cLittle General, please forgive this subordinate for being unable to do anything \u2026 His injuries are too severe, and I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to save him \u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s eyes turned red, he kicked the two of them to the side and said, \u201cEven if we can\u2019t save them, we have to! If he dies, you two can\u2019t live anymore! \u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he grabbed onto one of the person\u2019s collars with one hand and carried the two people to the side of Gao Xun\u2019s bed. Looking at his injured state, he said hoarsely, \u201cWhat are you doing if you don\u2019t stop the bleeding! Wait for me to drain your blood? \u201d</p><br/><p>The military doctor trembled, \u201cLittle General, spare me \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Most likely, Gao Xun was woken up by the sound of their voices. He slowly opened his pitch-black eyes, and there was no longer the luster of the past that shone in them. He covered his chest and smiled. His lips were pale, and even laughing would take a lot of effort. \u201cDon\u2019t make things difficult for them\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang released the two military doctors, glared at him, and ordered: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to make things difficult for them, then live on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Every word that Gao Xun said hurt his chest. He took out a bloodstained blueprint from his sleeve. Fortunately, it was made of sheepskin, and the contents were very clear. He passed it over to Zhong Shang with effort, and said word by word, \u201cI got this from Yan Yun \u2026 You hand it over to the crown prince \u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang took it and told his soldiers to pass it to the crown prince.</p><br/><p>His long, thick eyelashes drooped as if he were extremely tired. He would have to rest for a long time if he were to speak. He used to have a pair of beautiful eyes, bright and resplendent, with long eyelashes. When he smiled, his entire being was brimming with vitality. Unfortunately, all that remained was fatigue. He wanted to rest, but was unable to smile anymore.</p><br/><p>After a long time, until Zhong Shang almost thought that he wouldn\u2019t wake up again, he finally opened his eyes. He had seen this hairpin many times before and caressed it many times during the night. The luster of the jadeite was a little dim, but it was worn close to his body like a treasure.</p><br/><p>He had told himself before that he would definitely return it to her the next time he saw Xie Zhen. However, he couldn\u2019t bear to leave even after dragging it on again and again.</p><br/><p>This was the only thing he had to do with her. He probably didn\u2019t want to break this connection, which was why he comforted himself. Next time, and the next time.</p><br/><p>Actually, he did not know that even this hairpin was not Xie Zhen\u2019s.</p><br/><p>It was the hairpin that Ouyang Yi had bought that was exactly the same as Xie Zhen\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Only he, this fool, was treated like a treasure.</p><br/><p>Now, he solemnly handed the hairpin over to Zhong Shang. Frowning, he spoke with difficulty: \u201cHelp me with something \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang stared at him, \u201cSpeak.\u201d</p><br/><p>He gripped his wrist, and nearly begged: \u201cReturn the hairpin to Xie Zhen \u2026 \u201cHelp me, with a message \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang held his hand, as if his throat was choked with something, and he couldn\u2019t say a single word. He gritted his teeth and ruthlessly waved his hand away. \u201cI won\u2019t help you with this favor. If you want to carry the message, then tell it to her yourself!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun weakly curled his lips. Perhaps because the wounds on his body were too painful, he shrank back and looked a little wronged. \u201cI wanted to say it myself, but I might not have the chance \u2026\u201d He coughed a few times. The wound on his body was involved. He was in so much pain that he began to sweat and grimace.</p><br/><p>At this time, he was still in the mood to joke.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang shouted to him, \u201cDon\u2019t move!\u201d</p><br/><p>He lay back on the bed. The injury to his internal organs had not eased up until now. He put his hand to his neck and looked at it. It was full of blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cTell her \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He slowly closed his eyes, his voice growing softer and softer.</p><br/><p>\u201cI beg of you, please forgive me \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Guanju, on the River Continent. A fair and noble lady is a person that is easy to catch.</p><br/><p>The food flowed left and right. Fair and beautiful woman, I long for.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t wait to snore. He was relaxed, tossing and turning.</p><br/><p>Rolling over and over again \u2026</p><br/><p>He had liked her for so long that he could not sleep well every night.</p><br/><p>Now, he could finally rest in peace and sleep.</p><br/><p>If he wanted to find his Little Fairy in his dreams, it would be best if he could find her faster than Yan Yu this time. Make her his, never separate.</p><br/><p>The crown prince, having obtained the blueprint, had seen through the First Prince\u2019s scheme.</p><br/><p>The First Prince had originally intended to work in tandem and defeat Lanling City in one fell swoop. Now that the contents of the blueprint had been exposed, the officials who were in contact with the First Prince were naturally found out. The crown prince ordered them to be escorted to the city walls and their heads beheaded in front of all the citizens.</p><br/><p>The First Prince\u2019s plan fell apart, and Lan Ling managed to avoid a disaster.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun was a first class contributor.</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince requested for orders from the Emperor Yuan Hui, and gave him the title of a high rank fourth rank Braveheart Uncle.</p><br/><p>Emperor Yuan Hui agreed.</p><br/><p>But what was the use? Without a person, no matter how much vanity he had behind him, he would never be able to take back his life.</p><br/><p>Accompanying this news were the Jadeite Sword with a piece of gold and a piece of Guan Ju-1 sent back to the An Wang\u2019s Mansion. Zhong Shang was at the frontline, so he didn\u2019t have time to return to the capital.</p><br/><p>Before that, Xie Zhen had already heard the news of Gao Xun\u2019s death. She could not believe it at all, but after holding it in for three days, when she saw the hairpin, she could no longer hold it in and fell into Yan Yu\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>\u201cGao Xun will not die\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was still fine before he left, and he was just as chatty as before. Who knew that this would be the last time they would meet? If she knew that she would never see him again, would she still say such heartless words?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen sobbed as he hugged Yan Yu and refused to let go for a long time. Her crying body was trembling, making others think that she would faint the next second, but she didn\u2019t. She kept whispering in his ear, \u201cBig Brother Gao Xun won\u2019t die\u201d.</p><br/><p>Yes, how could he die?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu clenched his fists, and looked at the sky outside the window. The sound of the wind was lonely and lonely. The clouds moved about, and the weather was exactly the same as the day Gao Xun left. Everything was the same, except that he was gone.</p><br/><p>It had to be said that he was truly despicable in this regard.</p><br/><p>He clearly knew that Xie Zhen couldn\u2019t stop worrying about him, yet he left just like that, without even leaving them with a single word. He would think of him. He would think of him for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu lowered his head to look at the little girl in his arms, who was crying so hard that she couldn\u2019t catch his breath. He comforted her, \u201cDon\u2019t cry, there\u2019s another letter here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He opened the envelope for her and took out a piece of white paper. On the letter, there was only a single poem, and it was written with the exact words that Gao Xun had said before he passed away.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu read every line for her to hear, then stopped after every sentence, and quietly continued to read.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s initial wail turned into a wail as she wiped away her tears in his arms. In the end, she could no longer make a sound and fainted from her tears.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

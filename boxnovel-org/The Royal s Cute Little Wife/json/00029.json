One of them was dressed in a beautiful purple brocade brocade dress. He was around twenty years old. His appearance was handsome and condescending. He was indeed the current crown prince, Yan Tao.</p><br/><p>As he walked, he asked the people beside him, \u201cHave you found out who it was?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person beside him acknowledged, but his tone did not fluctuate at all. \u201cIt\u2019s Third Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince smiled, lowered his sleeve to cover the wound on his wrist, and continued to walk forward.</p><br/><p>After leaving the palace, they encountered an ambush. More than a dozen Death Soldiers rushed out from all directions, each and every one of them trying to take his life.</p><br/><p>It was probably because he was too carefree in the palace that third brother could not bear it any longer and wanted his life so badly.</p><br/><p>He tilted his head, deep in thought. \u201cWhat does Sixth Brother think about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>The person he called \u201cSixth Brother\u201d was a fifteen year old youth. He had delicate facial features, like a sculptor, and was extraordinarily handsome.</p><br/><p>He had been tanned a little in the past few years, and his skin was a light wheat color. He had lost the tender and delicate spirit of his childhood, and looked even more valiant and spirited.</p><br/><p>He had grown taller since last year, and now he was only a little lower than Yan Tao.</p><br/><p>He was the Sixth Prince, Yan Yu.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was silent for a moment before he analyzed calmly, \u201cThird Brother is too rash, so there is no need to be afraid of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just like what the Crown Prince thought, Yan Tao smiled and patted his shoulder, but didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>His sixth brother had been brought back from the common folk only nine years ago. When he had just entered the palace, he had been acting as if he was a complete and reckless person. He never expected that in just a few years, he had become a completely different person.</p><br/><p>It was like a completely different person. You could no longer see the childish shadow of him.</p><br/><p>This was a good thing, otherwise he would not have been able to survive in the palace.</p><br/><p>As he was speaking, he saw a person wearing a white cape walking out from the main courtyard of Duke Dingguo\u2019s residence. He couldn\u2019t see her appearance clearly, and her figure should be that of a slim young lady.</p><br/><p>The two of them ignored her. They walked up to take a look, only to realize that the girl had left in such a hurry that she didn\u2019t even notice that the handkerchief had fallen to the ground.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao bent down to pick it up and touched the fabric. It was extremely soft and silky, with a plain flower embroidered on the lower left corner. Other than that, there was nothing else.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao handed it to Yan Yu and said with a smile, \u201cSixth Brother, please wait here for a while. Maybe you can even meet that girl.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu took a glance at it and asked without much interest, \u201cSo what if I did?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Tao curled his lips, \u201cThen this second brother should be a matchmaker.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was actually such an idea \u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Yu pursed his lips, not even answering, \u201cThank you for your kind intentions second brother, I don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince sighed and said regretfully, \u201cSixth Brother, you are not young anymore. You don\u2019t have a woman by your side. Don\u2019t you feel lonely?\u201d</p><br/><p>In the royal family, it was already time for thirteen or fourteen to come into contact with a woman. Not only did he not take any concubines, he didn\u2019t even have a single building maid girl with him.</p><br/><p>Sometimes, Yan Tao would take him as a guest to his subjects\u2019 house, and dancers would enter in droves, each more delicate than the last. However, he didn\u2019t even raise his eyes and just drank his wine, not caring about anyone.</p><br/><p>No one knew what he was thinking at this time.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao thought he had no desire, but once, when he was drunk, he spilled a name from his mouth.</p><br/><p>His voice was so soft and repressed that Yan Tao did not hear him clearly.</p><br/><p>When she asked him later, he wouldn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao asked again, \u201cOr could it be that you already have a girl you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu stopped and looked ahead, \u201cWe have arrived. Dosen\u2019t Second Brother want to give a birthday present?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be late.\u201d</p><br/><p>As expected, he still refused to say \u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Tao smiled and stop asking.</p><br/><p>Out of the main yard, Xie Zhen never found out he\u2019d dropped anything.</p><br/><p>She was dizzy. She only knew how to walk back, not how much she cared.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu followed her, all her attention on her body, and naturally paid no attention to the fallen handkerchief.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked around. \u201cWhere is this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu did not know whether to laugh or cry. He supported her as she walked forward. \u201cMiss, this is the way back to Jade Hall.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said, \u201cWhere are mother and Ah Xun?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMadam and Seventh Miss should be entertaining guests in the front yard. They will be back in a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a few steps, she suddenly stopped and rolled her eyes. \u201cWe\u2019re not going back to the Jade Hall. Let\u2019s go to the backyard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu were at a loss, what was going on?</p><br/><p>This little mistress, you haven\u2019t recovered from your illness yet, can\u2019t we go back to our room and have a good rest?</p><br/><p>Of course, Shuang Yu would never dare to say it out loud. She tactfully persuaded him, \u201cYou hasn\u2019t taken your medicine yet \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xie Zhen\u2019s decision would not be easily changed.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo rush, let\u2019s go to the backyard first.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she ignored Shuang Yu and continued walking forward.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu hurried after her, frowning. \u201cWhat\u2019s the girl doing in the backyard?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old lady\u2019s birthday banquet. There should be a lot of ladies in the backyard, and they didn\u2019t know each other. Why would they go there?</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu felt helpless.</p><br/><p>The backyard was quite a distance away from the Jade Hall. After walking through the long corridor and passing through the two Lunar Grotto Gate, he would walk along the cobblestone path for a while before finally seeing the scenery of the backyard.</p><br/><p>There was a big lake in the backyard, and now it was frozen, with three octagonal pavilions, surrounded by ginkgo and pine trees, and last night there had been frost and a misty, glassy world.</p><br/><p>There was no one in the pavilion at the moment, so Xie Zhen walked over there and said to Shuang Yu, \u201cIt\u2019s too cold here. Go get two stoves and bring me my moon white and sky blue ice clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu did not understand what she meant. To bring the stove was fine, but why also to bring the clothes?</p><br/><p>But Xie Zhen insisted, \u201cYou can go if I tell you to.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu said no more. \u201cWait for me, young lady. I\u2019ll be back soon.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Shuang Yu had gone, Xie Zhen sat on the fence in the kiosk, leaned against the pillar, closed her eyes, and soon fell asleep.</p><br/><p>A short while later, Xie Ying and a few other girls walked in from the back of the group, led by Xie Yin and another girl in a white dress.</p><br/><p>They talked to each other and talked to each other, but no one noticed Xie Zhen in the pavilion.</p><br/><p>Dressed in a white silk coat, the Imperial Tutor\u2019s granddaughter, Ling Xiangyun, asked Xie Ying with a smile, \u201cI heard that the Fifth Miss and the Seventh Miss have returned. Why have I only seen the Seventh Miss but not the Fifth Miss?\u201d</p><br/><p>They had met Xie Xun in the main hall, and she was a rare beauty.</p><br/><p>When Ling Xiangyun saw her, she gave her praise, praising that her eyes could speak. She was the most beautiful little girl she had ever seen.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was frightened by her enthusiasm and refused to come out from behind Leng, only revealing a pair of watery eyes to peep at people.</p><br/><p>Ling Xiangyun fell in love with him immediately, and even invited Xie Xun to her house as a guest.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xie Wu didn\u2019t agree. She was shy.</p><br/><p>They had just come out of the front yard and thought of sitting in the back yard and talking. Just as Ling Xiangyun was thinking of that the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion had another miss, she casually asked.</p><br/><p>Xie Ying couldn\u2019t see the crown prince and the Sixth Prince. She absent-mindedly said, \u201cThe fifth sister have caught a cold and didn\u2019t come out today \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiangyun said regretfully, \u201cWhen spring opens, elder sister will hold a banquet at the mansion. I originally wanted to invite them all.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiangyun\u2019s sister, Ling Xiangmun, was the Crown Prince\u2019s wife. She had been married to the Crown Prince for two years and had a daughter.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xie Ying\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cThe Crown Princess wants to hold a banquet?\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded. \u201cThe peony flower that elder sister raised herself will bloom soon. I want to invite everyone to enjoy the flowers and cultivate the style.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crown prince\u2019s residence was filled with the children of high-ranking officials and nobles, and they might even bump into a few princes. Xie Ying was intrigued. \u201cI just happened to \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she could finish, Ling Xiangyun froze, staring straight ahead.</p><br/><p>Xie Ying followed her line of sight, and was stunned when she saw Xie Zhen snuggling on the pillars and taking a nap.</p><br/><p>If one were to say that a girl was the national color of the Heaven Fragrant Sky, it was possible that the person in front of them. People who saw her would immediately understand the meaning behind it.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s cheeks were pink, and her lips were slightly parted, like two bright blossoms of peach blossoms, delicate and beautiful.</p><br/><p>A strand of hair fell from her ears and covered her small face. It was as if the wind was blowing as she stroked her smooth face again and again.</p><br/><p>People would be a little envious of her hair and wanted to replace it and test how smooth and tender her face was.</p><br/><p>When she heard movement, her long eyelashes trembled as she slowly opened them. A pair of hazy watery eyes gazed at the approaching person.</p><br/><p>At first, she was a little confused, but when she saw who it was, she cutely called out: \u201cThird Sister, Fourth Sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice was soft, with the accent of someone who had just woken up. It tickled the ears of those who heard it.</p><br/><p>The others were stunned by what they saw. It turned out that the beauty was so beautiful when she woke up. Even though they were also women, they still felt her heart move.</p><br/><p>Xie Ying\u2019s expression was a little unsightly. She forced a smile, \u201cIsn\u2019t Fifth Sister sick? Why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>She stood up and rubbed her eyes. \u201cI remembered something and came over to wait for Third Sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Ying didn\u2019t understand. What could have happened?</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu had just returned from the Jade Hall\u2019s Courtyard. She was carrying a long-sleeved blouse in her hands while the two maidservants behind her were carrying a stove. They rushed over quickly and finally made it.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu came up to her. \u201cHere\u2019s the clothes, miss.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t take it. Instead, she asked her to deliver it to Xie Ying.</p><br/><p>Xie Ying didn\u2019t react. \u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked at Xie Yin, who suddenly had a bad premonition. Sure enough, she said, \u201cFourth Sister said your clothes don\u2019t fit. Our bodies are similar, so we can lend you my clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThis is my favorite. If Third Sister doesn\u2019t mind, then just wear it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Ying\u2019s face turned green. She actually said these things in public?</p><br/><p>Moreover, what kind of identity did she have to borrow clothes from the daughter of a concubine?</p><br/><p>Xie Ying glared at Xie Yin, her reproach obvious.</p><br/><p>Xie Yin did say it in private, but she didn\u2019t say it in front of her. How did she know?</p><br/><p>She immediately tried to explain, \u201cI didn\u2019t \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid Fourth Sister forget?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou asked the servant girl to tell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her ability to tell lies was superb, and her face did not change.</p><br/><p>As for which servant girl \u2026</p><br/><p>Let them check it out for themselves. It had nothing to do with her.</p><br/><p>Xie Ying wouldn\u2019t accept her clothes no matter what. Firstly, it was to save face, and secondly, she didn\u2019t like it.</p><br/><p>What kind of beautiful clothes could there be in the poor neighbouring areas of Qingzhou?</p><br/><p>Xie Ying didn\u2019t even spare a glance. \u201cThank you, Fifth Sister, but you probably heard wrong. I don\u2019t lack clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen then let Shuang Yu take the clothes away. She had reached her goal anyway, so it was good that Xie Ying didn\u2019t take it, and she wouldn\u2019t be willing to give it away.</p><br/><p>Although Xie Ying denied it, the eyes of the surrounding girls still changed. They thought Xie Ying was just concerned about face-saving, so she purposely said so.</p><br/><p>One of them even covered her mouth and laughed softly.</p><br/><p>Xie Ying\u2019s expression turned even uglier as she stared at Xie Yin like a knife.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Ling Xiangyun was attracted by the beauty and had already sent an invitation to Xie Zhen, \u201cMy sister, are you having a feast?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve just returned from the Qingzhou and should know more people. At that time, Princess Yi and you will also be going.\u201d</p><br/><p>Faced with such a generous invitation, Xie Zhen couldn\u2019t resist anymore, and finally nodded, \u201cOkay.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiangyun happily took her hand and said that she would send a carriage to welcome her to the Duke\u2019s Mansion and ask her to bring Xie Xun along with her.</p><br/><p>After the birthday banquet ended, Xie Ying hadn\u2019t taken care of Xie Yin for a few days.</p><br/><p>Xie Yin was at a loss, so she sneaked out to ask all of the maidservants, but none of them admitted to it.</p><br/><p>She was quite angry. She gave everyone a punishment, but still it did not let her anger go.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the grand imperial concubine set up a feast of peonies. She expressed her regards to Xie Yingseveral times, and only then did she reluctantly forgive her.</p><br/><p>The two of them discussed for a while before Xie Ying went to beg the eldest wife. The eldest wife was in charge of food, clothing and ordinary expense, so everything had to pass through her hands.</p><br/><p>Within a few days, she had sent over a dozen sets of high-quality cloths to the third branch and the fourth branch to make spring shirts. However, the ones she gave to the second branch, although not some inferior material, were not very good either, and their colors were also very dark, not suitable for teenage girls at all.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen only took a glance. Originally, she wanted to have someone burn it down, but after thinking for a moment, she got the maid to use it as a rag.</p><br/><p>Did they think that would embarrass her?</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t let them to be satisfied.</p><br/><p>Crown Prince\u2019s Palace.</p><br/><p>Since seeing Xie Zhen and Xie Xun, every time Ling Xiangyun came here, she would always praise them, \u201cElder sister doesn\u2019t know that the Fifth Miss and the Seventh Miss of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion are the true beauties. If I were a man, I would definitely marry them both \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The Crown Princess, Ling Xiangmeng, burst out laughing. Her personality was completely different from her younger sister\u2019s. Ling Xiangyun was a little carefree while she was gentle and virtuous.</p><br/><p>She pointed at her sister\u2019s nose. \u201cIt\u2019s the Flower Lover Feast in a few days. I\u2019d like to see if it\u2019s really like you said.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ling Xiangyun stuck up three fingers and swore, \u201cit\u2019s more than real!\u201d</p><br/><p>This words somehow reached the crown prince\u2019s ears. Yan Tao asked Ling Xiangmang, who was helping him to change his clothes, while shaking her head with a smile, \u201cHow could it be as exaggerated as Xiang Yun\u2019s words. Your highness knows her character, and she was crazy. She did not speak the truth.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

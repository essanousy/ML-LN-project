She said she was worried that they wouldn\u2019t be on good terms with each other. Since then, Xie Zhen knew that this was a restless maid. She was usually quite honest, but today her performance was too obvious. She probably couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore, so she exposed her flaws.</p><br/><p>Qing Xia was suddenly called out, and panic flashed across her face. Quickly, she lowered her head and said, \u201cEmpress, I am not looking at anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was not easily fooled. She gave her a lackadaisical look. \u201cNot looking at anything?\u201d \u201cThen I\u2019m sitting here for a while, but you didn\u2019t pour the tea, where are your thoughts?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026.\u201d Qing Xia wanted to say something, but she hesitated. She wanted to say that Shuang Yu had gone to pour some tea \u2026 But they had no room to refute what their master had said.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen insisted on getting to the bottom of the matter. \u201cIf you don\u2019t tell me the truth, I\u2019m going to sell you to a trader in human beings.\u201d she threatened.</p><br/><p>Qing Xia\u2019s face paled. They had all come out from the hands of the trades and knew what kind of life it was. Every day, the traders would always scold them, and there hadn\u2019t been a single good meal. She was immediately terrified and honestly explained, \u201cIn earlier I saw that you went out with His Highness, but now only you come back. Out of curiosity, I gave you a few more glances.\u201d She then admitted her mistake in fear and trepidation, \u201cI know my mistake.I won\u2019t dare to look around in the future and begged the Empress not to sell me.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as she finished speaking, Yan Yu stepped in from outside. Upon hearing Qing Xia\u2019s words, he looked over and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the selling thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Xia was sobbing. Looking at Xie Zhen, it seemed that she wanted to say something but she didn\u2019t dare to say.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen held her head with ong of her hands. \u201cIf there are any disobedient maids in the house, can I make the decision?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu held another matter in his heart and said casually: \u201cAs you wish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked towards Qing Xia, smiling, \u201cDid you hear that?\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, Qing Xia was both ashamed and humiliated, but she quickly turned into a submissive manner, bowing slightly. \u201cI heard you, may the Empress give me another chance, and I will do my best to serve you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen asked her to leave. When she reached the door, Xie Zhen called out, \u201cYou\u2019ve just come into the mansion, and many things you did are not as good as the Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan. Just follow them for a few days to help them.\u201d</p><br/><p>The eight servant maids were originally of the same status. They were all personal attendants of the Sixth Prince and the Empress. This way, only the status of Qing Xia was lower than others of them by a level. Qing Xia\u2019s eyes immediately turned red. She subconsciously looked at Yan Yu, but Yan Yu didn\u2019t even glance at her. He was completely focused on coaxing his wife.</p><br/><p>As soon as Qing Xia was leaving, Shuang Yu came in with a cup of tea. Just as she was about to ask what caused Qing Xia\u2019s eyes to turn red, she saw the strange atmosphere between Xie Zhen and Yan Yu. She was with good eyesight, so she left without saying anything.</p><br/><p>As soon as all of them left, Yan Yu said: \u201cI spoke too loudly.\u201d</p><br/><p>The meaning behind his words was that he wasn\u2019t yelling her on purpose.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tilted her head. \u201cHow loudly?\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought for a moment. \u201cAs loudly as I did just now.\u201d</p><br/><p>All right. Xie Zhen\u2019s lips pursed. She added, \u201cThen shouldn\u2019t you apologize to me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned his head and looked at her incredulously.</p><br/><p>The look in his eyes probably meant \u2014 I\u2019ve said to this point, why should I apologize?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen knew it was impossible to hear an apology from him, so she didn\u2019t force him. \u201cSo, every time you break your promise, just let me stay with my family for one more day, okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu thought for a while and nodded in agreement.</p><br/><p>In any case, he thought he would only make this one mistake and let her stay at home for a day at most.</p><br/><p>Qing Xia was assigned to Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan as a helper, with a sense of dissatisfaction.</p><br/><p>Probably she was crazy. The more she thought about it, the more frustrated she became. The more she thought about it, the more she felt that it was Xie Zhen who was hindering her future. She was not convinced, but maintained her composure. She still did her best to do things for Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan. All the maidservants liked her, and even were willing to let her bring the desserts and tea to the living room.</p><br/><p>Occasionally, she would meet Yan Yu alone in the room. Then she would exchange a few words with him.</p><br/><p>Today, it should be Cui Shan\u2019duty to bring tea to the study, but Cui Shan was not comfortable, so she asked her to do it. Yan Yu was alone in the study room. He sat by the bed, quietly reading a book. She stepped forward and gently called out, \u201cYour Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without raising his head, Yan Yu knocked on the edge of the table. \u201cPut it down.\u201d</p><br/><p>She put down the tea and desserts, putting them one by one in a very slow manner, \u201cWhat is Your Highness reading?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not give her any face, \u201cWhat does it have to do with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>She did not flinch and said in a soft voice, \u201cWhen I was young, Father could read, so he taught me a few words. Unfortunately, I was too poor to afford the ink and paper, so I did not continue.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu asked coldly, \u201cWhat does it have to do with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he was not interested, his answers were usually divided into two categories: \u201cWhat\u2019s it to do with you\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s it to do with me\u201d.</p><br/><p>Qing Xia did not give up, \u201cYour Highness, don\u2019t you want to try some deserts \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was not enthusiam at him in these days. He was hurt, so he wanted to be alone for a moment by reading books. However, he did not expect it to not be quiet anywhere. He only felt that this woman really had a lot of nonsense to say. Why was she still standing there after giving him deserts? He looked at her coldly and said bluntly, \u201cYou may leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Xia was disappointed as she bowed and retreated.</p><br/><p>As soon as she left the study room, she saw Shuang Yu walking towards her. Shuang Yu were very enthusiastic when she saw her. \u201cLittle Sister Qing Xia, there\u2019s a dirty floor in the porch. I don\u2019t have time to clean it up. Help me wipe it clean.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Qing Xia was about to refuse, Shuang Yu added, \u201cNormally at the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, this work is done by me and Shuang Yan. After all, it\u2019s not a big deal, so I\u2019ll do it if I can.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she walked far away.</p><br/><p>She had said it on purpose, and there was no reason for her to refuse when she said it, because Xie Zhen had told her to help her and Shuang Yan.</p><br/><p>Qing Xia stood in the Gallery veranda, and a trace of hostility rose inher eyes.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu left the study and went straight to the main room, while Xie Zhen was sitting inside. She went in and recounted what she had heard, then suggested, \u201cYou can\u2019t keep a maid like that, mistress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her bones were restless, and she would not take long to climb onto her master\u2019s bed. Now that Xie Zhen and Yan Yu had just gotten married, the servant maid was already ready to make a move. How good would it be after a period of time? She stood next to Xie Zhen and whispered into her ear earnestly, \u201cIt\u2019s not onlyQing Xia \u2026All the maids serving in this courtyard must be properly managed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had the same feeling. \u201cSo what do you say I should do about it?\u201d she asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu had stayed with the Madam Leng for two or three years. At that time, Madam Leng and Xie Liqing still lived in the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion and had not moved to Qingzhou yet. Shuang Yu had seen a lot of such cases, so she was good at dealing with it. She whispered in her ear for a moment, then said, \u201cMistress just needs to make an example, and the rest of them will know how to restrain themselves.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen nodded thoughtfully. After that, she was a little confused. Why would she do that? What did it have to do with her if whoever wanted to hook up with Yan Yu?</p><br/><p>She thought for a moment until she found it was probably because she didn\u2019t like being fooled.</p><br/><p>The fifteenth day of the month was the last day of Yan Yu\u2019s vacation.</p><br/><p>At night, the moon was bright and the stars were sparse. On a whim, Xie Zhen set a table of dishes in a pavilion in the yard and ate while admiring the moon.</p><br/><p>She invited Yan Yu to join her, and they sat at the same table, facing each other.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was smiling. She picked up a liquor saturated shrimp for him. \u201cYou try this. It\u2019s my favorite dish.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not like these things that needed to be peeled off. He found them troublesome, but since she was the one who picked up, he could just barely taste it. He took off shrimp\u2019s head and tail, peeled off the shell, and put it in his mouth to chew.</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it good?\u201d Xie Zhen asked expectantly.</p><br/><p>Other than the freshness of the meat, there was nothing special about it. Yan Yu nodded reluctantly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>She smiled and picked up one for herself.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu barely moved his chopsticks. He had been watching her eat all the time, but in the end, his gaze made her uncomfortable all over her body. She stopped and asked, \u201cWhat are you watching me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had just finished a bite of the sweet and sour sweet, and there was a little soup on the corner of her mouth, but she did not mind. She stuck out her tongue and gently licked it, unaware that it made his throat tighten.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu hurriedly averted his gaze and said hoarsely, \u201cWhy did you call me here?\u201d</p><br/><p>She pointed to the top of her head. \u201cTo admire the moon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tonight the moon was like a silver plate, bright and round, high in the sky, with branches on either side of it, as if one could reach out and touch it.</p><br/><p>However, Yan Yu didn\u2019t believe this answer. A few days ago, she treat him neither hostile nor friendly, and he even suggested taking her to Spring Blossom Castle. She didn\u2019t even agree, so why did she suddenly be friendly towards him today \u2026 Yan Yu believed there must be something strange in it. As for what it was, he couldn\u2019t quite put his finger on it.</p><br/><p>At that moment, Tan Mei brought a pot of wine over, interrupting all of his thoughts. He blocked the wine pot, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to serve wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>This wine was actually asked by Xie Zhen. \u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know how drunk she\u2019d been the last time she\u2019d drunk a glass of cross-cupped wine.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu looked at her with mockery in his eyes, \u201cDo you know what you looks like when you are drunk?\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head like a rattle. \u201cI was drunk?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu didn\u2019t want to explain anything to her, so he just let Tan Mei carry the wine down.</p><br/><p>It was fine if they didn\u2019t drink, but they would eat and admire the moon. Halfway through the meal, she said she was going back to the room to take something, and she said to Yan Yu: \u201cYou lie down on the table, close your eyes, and don\u2019t peep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu frowned, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI won\u2019t tell you.\u201d she said mysteriously.</p><br/><p>At first, Yan Yu didn\u2019t want to do it, but when he met her gaze of expectation, he could only do so expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t open your eyes,\u201d she repeated several times. When she saw that Yan Yu was lying flat on the table, not moving at all, she quickly ran back into the room and rummaged through her things.</p><br/><p>A hot dish had just been prepared in the kitchen over there, and the cook was too busy to help out. So he asked Qing Xia to serve the dish.</p><br/><p>When Qing Xia arrived, Yan Yu was still lying prone on the stone table, half of his handsome face exposed. His eyes were closed, as if he had fallen asleep.</p><br/><p>She took the dish out of the box and set it on the table. He still hadn\u2019t woken up.</p><br/><p>So she dared to come up to him and put her hand on the back of his hand on the table.</p><br/><p>Before she could take it back, she was grabbed by the wrist by a strong force. It was so strong that she immediately cried out in pain.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu opened his eyes and looked at her coldly.</p></blockquote></div><br/>\n</div>"}

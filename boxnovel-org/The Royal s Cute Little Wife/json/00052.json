The bath barrel was placed behind a curled screen that was embedded flower and bird pattern.</p><br/><p>The screen wasn\u2019t big, barely block her figure.</p><br/><p>She took off her clothes and sat in the water , scrubing herself from hair to toe.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t dare to bath too slowly, because they would return her home later. After washing herself quickly, she stood up and looked to the side. She found that she had forgotten to bring her clothes with her.</p><br/><p>She had to sit back down and called Tan Mei. \u201cTake my clothes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Mei was standing outside, hearing this she hurriedly responded and then turned around to get her clothes.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu had already packed everything up. He was sitting on the rose chair of the fragrant rosewood outside, lowered his head, expressionless as he waited for the others.</p><br/><p>Tan Mei was in a hurry with a little of rashness. After finding Xie Zhen\u2018s clothes, she quickly ran over, wantting to give them to her.</p><br/><p>She stumbled over her left foot on her right foot and staggered a few steps, dropping Xie Zhen\u2019s orange bellyband to the ground.</p><br/><p>A gust of wind blew, and the bellyband just happened to float to Yan Yu\u2019s feet.</p><br/><p>At first he didn\u2019t know what it was. He bent down and picked it up.</p><br/><p>His mind was in turmoil. When he thought about Xie Zhen was taking a bath, he felt a surge of Qi and blood rushing up his chest, straight into the top of his skull.</p><br/><p>He covered his mouth and coughed lightly, then handed bellyband to Tan Mei, \u201cQuick, send it in.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tan Mei suddenly came to a realization and said: \u201cThis servant is lacking in manners.\u201d</p><br/><p>She quickly walked into the inner room.</p><br/><p>Finally, Xie Zhen thought that the bellyband was dirty, she had Tan Mei take another one from the cabinet.</p><br/><p>Of course, she didn\u2019t know that Yan Yu had touched it. She didn\u2019t have the time to reprimand Tan Mei, changed clothes and combed her hair into a bun, and hurriedly got on the carriage back to Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>It was probably the result of the bath, but there was a mist of moisture about Xie Zhen that made him feel cool sitting next to her.</p><br/><p>As she hurried off, she sat in the carriage and put on her body perfume. It was the fragrance of the lotus she used the most. She lightly touched it to her neck and wrist, and it gave off a delicate fragrance.</p><br/><p>Not long later, the entire carriage was filled with the fragrance.</p><br/><p>She did not shy away from Yan Yu; she sat beside him as if she could not see him.</p><br/><p>Other than them, there were also Shuang Yan and Shuang Yan in the carriage. The carriage was very quiet on the way, and no one said a word.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu pretended to ask casually, \u201cWhat fragrance?\u201d</p><br/><p>She covered it with a porcelain stopper and concisely said, \u201cLotus body perfume.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she mentioned it, he remembered the handkerchief the Crown Prince had picked up.</p><br/><p>It was precisely because of this fragrance that Yan Tao was unable to forget her. He frowned in displeasure, \u201cDon\u2019t use this fragrance any more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked up at him and it was obvious from the look in her eyes that she was saying, What\u2019s it got to do with you?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu also knew that his request was unreasonable, but he could not explain himself. Thus, he turned his head to the side and said incoherently, \u201cI don\u2019t like this fragrance.\u201d</p><br/><p>But instead, Xie Zhen gave a gentle smile, like a water lily blooming on a summer\u2019s day, and without warning, bloomed with a beautiful color.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s fine as long as I do.\u201d</p><br/><p>She leaned back against the Delicate embroidered satin pillow, closed her eyes, and paid no more attention to him.</p><br/><p>There were servant maids in the carriage, so he couldn\u2019t say too much. Even though he was filled with anger, he still silently swallowed it back when he saw her sleeping figure.</p><br/><p>She was really sleepy. Soon, she fell into a deep sleep, falling her head on the pillow. She didn\u2019t look like a lady from a big family at all.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu couldn\u2019t bear to watch any longer, so he sat down and supported her head so that she could lean on him.</p><br/><p>She was obedient. She laid her head on his shoulder without a word of complaint, and after a while her head slid down on his chest.</p><br/><p>He opened his arms and drew her into them.</p><br/><p>The carriage stopped at the entrance of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion. Someone knocked on Xie Zhen\u2019s head, and a nasty voice sounded out, \u201cWake up, we\u2019re here.\u201d</p><br/><p>She slowly opened her eyes and saw Yan Yu\u2019s exquisite face.</p><br/><p>She opened her eyes wide and looked around in confusion. She then did a quick double take that she had actually fallen into his arms. Immediately, she scrambled out of his embrace, puckered her temples, and unhurriedly explained, \u201cI\u2019m asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not expect her to have a guilty conscience. He could not help but take a few more glances at her.</p><br/><p>This was a rare opportunity. He pointed at the watermark on his chest, \u201cIf someone sees it later, how should I explain it?\u201d</p><br/><p>She turned her head at a glance, her ears pink and delicate, her voice soft and small. \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s thin lips curved up in a faint smile, almost as if she was deeply in love with him. \u201cYou took my life and didn\u2019t thank me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She lifted the curtain and was about to go down when Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan began to be worried about their miss. It was already at the door of her home, they didn\u2019t hope to see they had any argument anyway\u2026</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Xie Zhen just got off the carriage and waited for Yan Yu to come down before following him into the mansion without saying a word.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu seemed to be in a good mood and did not keep a straight face.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was small with narrow steps, while Yan Yu was tall with wide steps, so after a while, the gap between them became larger and larger.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t realize it, but after walking for a while, when he looked back, he saw that Xie Zhen was a dozen steps behind.</p><br/><p>He stood where he was, waiting for her to arrive. The first thing he said was, \u201cWhy are you walking so slowly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said calmly. \u201cI can\u2019t walk fast.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu glanced at her legs, feeling that it was understandable. He then asked, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you stop me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She held her dress up the steps and stood on the third steps, still not as tall as he was.</p><br/><p>She looked back at him. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for you to find out.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she finish speaking, she turned and led the way.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu had nothing to say, but he did learn to be wise, slowing down and walking beside her, taking her situation into account, deliberately taking smaller steps.</p><br/><p>He asked her, \u201cHave you not grown in these seven years?\u201d</p><br/><p>When mentioning it, Xie Zhen felt her accumulation of depression was difficult to smooth. She stared at him. \u201cOf course I\u2019ve grown taller, don\u2019t you see?\u201d</p><br/><p>Was that so?</p><br/><p>There was obvious doubt in Yan Yu\u2019s eyes. She looked just as she had been when she was young.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are always taller than me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to talk about it, so she walked ahead without saying a word.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu slowly followed behind her. On a whim, he raised his hand and pointed it at the top of her head, right at his chest.</p><br/><p>Who would have thought that she would catch this scene. She suddenly turned around and angrily said, \u201cDon\u2019t be proud, my brother is taller than you!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was stunned for a moment before he remembered that she also had an elder brother who was extremely protective of her.</p><br/><p>The two of them finally arrived at the central room, surrounded by a large group of people. When the people from the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion heard that the sixth prince was bringing his princess back, they stood up early in the morning to wait for them.</p><br/><p>Now that he heard the servants say that the two of them had arrived, they hurriedly went to the entrance to welcome them.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu and Xie Zhen walked over side by side, the Duke Dingguo bowed with his family, \u201cThis old official pays his respects to your majesty, and greets the Empress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen saw that he and her parents were about to salute her, how could she bear it? Her eyes reddened as she rushed forward, \u201cGrandfather, are you trying to kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019re not allowed to pay your respects, and neither are you, Father and Mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng and Xie Liqing stood behind the Duke Dingguo. Their eyes were filled with a bitter smile before finally turning into a single sentence, \u201cLittle Lamb has returned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duke Dingguo and the Second Branch were pardoned by Xie Zhen to avoid saluting, but the others didn\u2019t have her pardon, and had to bow to her and Yan Yu.</p><br/><p>The first branch all forced themselves to laugh. their own daughter hadn\u2019t been married yet, and Xie Zhen\u2019s rank in the family was much smaller than Xie Ying\u2019s. Who would expect that she would actually marry so well.</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen got home, she and her parents naturally had endless talks. She pestered Madam Leng and hugged Xie Xun. It was just two days since they had last seen each other, as if they had been separated for more than a decade.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng said that she was married, so she should have the appearance of a married woman. However, she was still a child in the depths of her bones. After saying a few pleasing words in Madam Leng\u2018s arms, she easily fooled around with it.</p><br/><p>While Yan Yu was talking with the duke and the men in the mansion, Xie Zhen and the wowen went to the west wing. When they separated, she looked more like a wild lamb, no longer needing to dress up and could laugh without restraint.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng touched the tip of her nose. \u201cYou\u2019ve been so restrained these past two days?\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded. As for the reason, she couldn\u2019t say. She could only shrink back into Madam Leng\u2019s embrace. \u201cMother, please be good to me. I have to leave today.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng scolded her for being heartless, \u201cDo I treat you badly?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat did you say.\u201d</p><br/><p>She chuckled and held onto her arm, unwilling to let go. \u201cMother treats me the best, better than anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>On one side, the mother and daughter were tiresome with their words. On the other side, Madam Wu and Madam Xu listened for a while. Madam Wu could not help but interject: \u201cWhy did Ah Zhen say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that the sixth prince treats you badly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen raised her eyes, and gave Madam Wu a glance before saying with a smile. \u201d Brother Xiao Yu\u2019s been very good to me. When we entered the palace together, His Majesty even gave me such a big luminous pearl.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she gestured with her hand. Her tone was filled with excitement and joy, looking just like a naive and ignorant little girl.</p><br/><p>Madam Wu noticed the size of her gestures and couldn\u2019t help but reveal a bit of envy.</p><br/><p>Thinking of something, she deliberately looked left and right before whispering, \u201cBut how come I\u2019ve heard of it \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tilted her head. \u201cWhat did you heard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Wu pretended to mutter and mumble, \u201cI heard that you and the sixth prince \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Wu could not finish her words before Madam Leng stopped her with harsh words and looks, \u201cThird Sister-in-Law!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had never seen Madam Leng so angry before, and she stiffened in her arms. She knew it was not a good thing.</p><br/><p>She innocently grabbed Madam Leng\u2019s hand and gently comforted her, \u201cMother, don\u2019t be angry. I came back today, so why should you be angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>As the words came out of her mouth, the expression on the face of Madam Leng had eased up a bit. On the other side,Madam Xu responded: \u201cSecond Sister-in-Law can block our mouth, but you can\u2019t block the mouths of others.\u201d</p><br/><p>The whole circle of ladies knew that Ah Zhen and sixth prince hadn\u2019t even drunk a cross-cupped wine on their wedding night, and the sixth prince had left her alone in their bridal chamber. He didn\u2019t come back until the latter half of the night.</p><br/><p>\u201cI wonder where he has gone to during this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was shocked. She didn\u2019t expect that it was actually about this matter.</p><br/><p>On the day that Yan Yu had left her in the bridal chamber, there weren\u2019t many people. She could count them with a finger.</p><br/><p>Princess Yi and the Crown Princess didn\u2019t seem to be gossips who knew how to shut up. So, who was the one that spread the news?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen clenched her teeth and felt a little cold in her heart.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t expect that it would be her first aunt and third aunt who would embarrass her in the end.</p><br/><p>After calming down from her rage, her heart calmed down. She held Madam Leng\u2019s hand tightly as if comforting her while biting her lip with a smile. \u201cFirst Aunt and Third Aunt, where did you hear that from?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Wu couldn\u2019t hide the gloating look in her eyes. \u201cEveryone is saying, who knows where it came from.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had been jealous for a while of the way Xie Zhen was granted the marriage to the sixth prince without warning.</p><br/><p>And now there was a scandal that seemed to give them something to laugh at, something to hold on to so hard that it made them live better than Xie Zhen, or, rather, it made them feel a little better in their own hearts.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said slowly. \u201cDid Third Aunt see it with your own eyes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Wu stared blankly, and said indignantly: \u201cI didn\u2019t see it, but I was not the source. Someone must have seen it with their own eyes, that\u2019s why they said that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s hand that gripped on Madam Leng\u2019s hands gradually turned cold, and her heart was in a mess.</p><br/><p>This was a fact. No matter how angry she was, she could not refute this fact.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng was so angry that her entire body trembled. \u201cThird Sister-in-Law is the elder of Little Lamb. How can you say such things in front of her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cCould it be that you want the child to see with her own eyes what it means to be an elder without elder\u2019s respect?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Wu choked. \u201cWhy do I not have the respect?\u201d</p><br/><p>In end, Madam Wu was impulsive and easily angered by Madam Leng. She coldly snorted as she sat to the side, unwilling to accept this: \u201cYou still don\u2019t want me to speak the truth?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Xu gave her a look, telling her to be quiet. Then she said to Madam Leng and Xie Zhen, \u201cIt\u2019s fine as long as we know about this. Even if Little Lamb admits it, we aunts won\u2019t laugh at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow could someone as noble as the sixth prince have his eyes on \u2026? \u201d</p><br/><p>Halfway through her speech, she stopped.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was angry to extreme. Instead, she smiled. \u201cFirst aunt is wrong, no matter what his previous identity was, but after the wedding, he is my husband.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she raised a pair of beautiful eyes and calmly glanced at them. \u201cThe mouth is others\u2019, and the ears are your own.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf others believe what they hear, they are fools.\u201d</p><br/><p>Those words silenced the two of them.</p><br/><p>Madam Xu stood up furiously: \u201cHow did you talk to your elders?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen still sat on the couch. \u201cDo you think you act and speak like an elder?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was still the same, eloquent, able to choke people half to death with her easy words.</p><br/><p>Madam Xu was so angry that her chest rose and fell. Normally, she would have punished her with the old lady. However, since the old lady was not here today and Xie Zhen had become the esteemed Prince\u2019s wife, she really couldn\u2019t be harmed for the time being.</p><br/><p>In the end, she had no choice but to swallow her anger until her face turned purple.</p><br/><p>It was the first time that Xie Zhen had displeased others like this.</p><br/><p>But they couldn\u2019t blame her. They had said all this in front of her and her mother, but they hadn\u2019t considered their feelings from the start, so why should she think about theirs?</p><br/><p>Xie Ying stood behind Madam Xu. Previously, she showed her good will towards Xie Zhen, so she didn\u2019t say much, but now she couldn\u2019t help but speak up for Madam Xu: \u201cIt\u2019s not my mother\u2019s fault. Ah Zhen, aren\u2019t you going to explain yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked at her. \u201cIt\u2019s nonsense. why should I explain?\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as she finished speaking, a voice came from the door. \u201cYour Highness, the Empress is inside.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen looked behind the screen, the door was pushed open with a squeak.</p><br/><p>It turned out that the conversation in the main hall had ended and was about to have lunch. Yan Yu came to find Xie Zhen. As soon as he entered the room, he felt that the atmosphere was not right.</p><br/><p>He looked to Xie Zhen sitting next to Madam Leng, her head drooping in a pitiful way.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu walked over and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked up, with her eyes red, the tears rolling in her eyes, as if she would burst into tears in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was startled and panicked. He squatted in front of her and wanted to touch her, but he didn\u2019t dare. He anxiously asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you crying for? Can\u2019t you tell me? \u201d</p><br/><p>She sniffled and whined, \u201cFirst Aunty said \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Most likely, she was too wronged. She held onto his sleeve and didn\u2019t finish a complete sentence for a long time.</p><br/><p>However, Yan Yu heard the first part clearly.</p><br/><p>He suddenly stood up, turned around and fiercely glared at Madam Xu, then questioned: \u201cWhat did you say to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>When Madam Xu met his eyes, she trembled all over.</p><br/><p>Who would have thought that, Xie Zhen was still fine and majestic like a lion cub a minute ago, but then cried so pitifully just as the sixth prince arrived?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

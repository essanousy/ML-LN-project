Teenagers were always impulsive and full of energy. Now that he finally met the long-desired little girl, he couldn\u2019t bear to let her go, wanting to swallow her whole.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen let out a moan, breathless from his kiss, her cheeks flushed red, \u201cBrother\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She finally pulled away, turning her head to catch her breath.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was not much better off than she was. He looked at her with red eyes, and when she was done gasping for air, he held her head and continued to kiss her.</p><br/><p>There was no end to the kiss, and a quarter of an hour later, Xie Zhen was on the verge of crying and pushing him feebly. \u201cThat\u2019s enough.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her mouth hurt when he bit her. Was he a dog?</p><br/><p>She never realized before that he actually had times to pester someone like this.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu let go of her lips and switched to kissing and gnawing on her face, first her eyes and then her ears, chewing on Xie Zhen\u2019s face until it was full of saliva.</p><br/><p>As he gnawed on her face, she wiped it with her sleeve, feeling that the scene was somewhat familiar. \u201cDon\u2019t bite anymore \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh, so dirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>But then he stuck his tongue into her ear and said, \u201cI\u2019ve kissed you, and you think I\u2019m dirty?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s whole body went numb and half of her body went soft.</p><br/><p>Her left ear was very fragile. Normally, when someone was speaking into her ear, it would itch unbearably. But now that he was licking her ear, she didn\u2019t even have the slightest bit of strength to resist. Her body trembled, \u201cGet up \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu found it, his eyes deepened, and he deliberately whispered in her ear: \u201cXie Zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>She rolled onto her stomach and covered her ears with both hands, only exposing half of her pink cheeks.</p><br/><p>He took her hand away and asked, \u201cCall me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t want to talk to him, but he played around with her ears and bit her earlobes.</p><br/><p>She wanted to cry, but her body was weak and numb. \u201cYan Yu \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He pursed his lips in dissatisfaction. \u201cIt\u2019s not that.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLi Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot either.\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew what he wanted her to call him, but she was not convinced. Why should she follow his orders?</p><br/><p>She wouldn\u2019t let him do as he wished, so she deliberately called him, \u201cSister Xiao Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s handsome face turned black with anger, \u201cSay it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>She buried her head in the pillow, unable to see his face, and boldly added: \u201cSister Xiao Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Good, very good.</p><br/><p>He cursed the little bastard in his heart and flipped her over, only then did he see the crafty smile in her eyes.</p><br/><p>He was even more angry. He lowered his head and once again held the corner of her mouth as he repeatedly tossed and turned, lingering endlessly.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had been kissed by him so many times that evening that she finally stayed away from him, not allowing him to take a step closer.</p><br/><p>Her lips were swollen, and her face and neck were covered with his saliva. She wiped them clean again and again with her sleeve, feeling disgusted.</p><br/><p>Just as she was thinking of something, Yan Yu, lying beside her, said, \u201cSing me a song.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was angry. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>He automatically ignored her refusal and said slowly, \u201cSing the one you used to sing for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou learned it in Qing Zhou.\u201d</p><br/><p>Who said she was going to sing for him?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stared at him. \u201cI forgot it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was disappointed and turned to ask, \u201cWhy are you so stupid?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI still remember it all. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen got interested. She smiled at him with some malice. \u201cOh, do you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen sing it to me. Maybe I\u2019ll remember it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu kept a straight face and refused to sing.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen half rose up, persuaded him in a soft and sweet tone. \u201cYou will sing it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLet me know, what song is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He put the mattress directly over her head, wrapped his arms around her, took her in his arms, and said in a cold voice, \u201cGo to sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen pursed her lips, and said in a low, muffled voice under the mattress. \u201cI know you don\u2019t sing well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Because his voice was hoarse and deep, like his brother\u2019s when he was fifteen or sixteen.</p><br/><p>Her brother didn\u2019t speak much at the time, he really talked a lot.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen felt stuffy. When she came out from the mattress, she just looked into Yan Yu\u2019s gaze. The two of them paused for a moment. They had too much intimacy just now, before they became shy.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, it was late at night, so it was hard to see the blush on each other\u2019s faces. One of them lowered her heads and pretended to be asleep while the other looked elsewhere.</p><br/><p>In the middle of the night, Xie Zhen slept soundly.</p><br/><p>There was always a familiar nursery rhyme in the ear, sung by a man with a low voice, afraid of waking something, awkward and gentle.</p><br/><p>\u201cPea white, I\u2019ll do it again.\u201d</p><br/><p>Recently, the servant maids in the courtyard noticed that the relationship between the sixth prince and the princess seemed to have changed.</p><br/><p>As for the change, they couldn\u2019t tell it exactly \u2026</p><br/><p>They felt that the two of them were much closer to each other all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>For example, no matter what the princess did, the sixth prince\u2019s gaze would always chase after her. After being discovered by the princess, he hurriedly moved away.</p><br/><p>For example, the sixth prince always sent his subordinates away to stay alone in the room with the princess. No one knew what they had did, but the two of them turned red every time.</p><br/><p>And \u2026</p><br/><p>The sixth prince didn\u2019t sleep in the inner room any longer, he would sit up in the middle of the night and go to the side room to share a bed with the princess.</p><br/><p>This feeling was not bad, because even them servants felt happy in their hearts.</p><br/><p>It was as if a child had made a ruckus for a long time, and finally managed to eat the candy that he liked.</p><br/><p>Afraid that eating sugar too fast would melt, he would carefully lick it again and again, and each time he licked it, he would feel a layer of sweetness in his heart.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu felt the same way.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare do anything too outrageous to Xie Zhen, but he could not help but be close to her, so he could only kissed her and licked her from time to time.</p><br/><p>Once his eyes went red and he almost stripped off her clothes, revealing a peach-colored bellyband. He didn\u2019t even have time to look at her white skin before Xie Zhen shoved him aside, red-eyed, and said to him, \u201cI, I\u2019m not at my fifteen yet\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s true that they got married in such a hurry that she\u2019s still a child.</p><br/><p>Thus, even if he endured it until it was hard to bear, he was unwilling to touch her again.</p><br/><p>During this period, Yan Yu frequently went to the study room. In order to collect Xie Liqing\u2019s achievements, he went there for the better part of a day.</p><br/><p>He always forgot to eat when he was busy, so he usually had stomachache at night.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen let Shuang Yu to carry dishes for him. He didn\u2019t eat and said he wanted her to bring him the meal.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had never known he was such an unreasonably troublesome man. She said he was troublesome, but in the end she went on her own.</p><br/><p>She carried the food box to the study, and seeing that he was absorbed in reading, she did not disturb him. She brought out the dishes and placed it on the square table beside her, stood up, and left.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu called out to her: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you talking?\u201d</p><br/><p>She asked curiously, \u201cAren\u2019t you busy?\u201d</p><br/><p>He put down his pen. \u201cYou say and I\u2019m listenning.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, Xie Zhen didn\u2019t have anything else to say. After thinking for a long time, she pointed at the dishes on the table, \u201cRemember to have dinner later.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she quickly took her skirt and ran out of the study room.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s thin lips pursed into a line as he watched her departing figure from the window. With a soft snort, he finally refused to obediently have his meal.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen knew it, and was unhappy. She sat in her study every day to supervise him, waiting for him to finish his meal.</p><br/><p>After a while, she would find a book she liked to read in her study and sit beside him on the couch.</p><br/><p>At first it was fine, but then he couldn\u2019t bear to have her in the house, and every time he looked at the papers he glanced at her, and saw that she was so engrossed in her book that she didn\u2019t care about him, and he was a little annoyed.</p><br/><p>He stood up and walked to her side. He held her head in his hands and kissed her.</p><br/><p>He learned fast, and in a few days he was good at it, making her dizzy, lying on his chest and letting him do whatever he wanted.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat kind of book are you reading?\u201d</p><br/><p>he whispered in her left ear.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen put down the book and left. \u201cI\u2019m not going to read it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He always kissed her at random, and she was secretly laughed at several times by Shang Yu and Shuang Yan.</p><br/><p>\uff0c\uff0c\uff0c\uff0c\uff0c\uff01</p><br/><p>She finally knew where the big dog from that night. Wasn\u2019t it him? At that time, they were still in a bad mood, but she never expected him to act so shamelessly!</p><br/><p>How could Yan Yu bear to part with her? He enveloped her for another moment before saying, \u201cYou can continue to read here from now on.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t answer. He massaged her ear with his thumb. \u201cWill you read or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her neck contracted and she couldn\u2019t help wanting to hide, but he was everywhere. Where could she hide?</p><br/><p>She could only compromise, \u201cOK, I\u2019ll read here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Satisfied, he hugged her soft body and loved it.</p><br/><p>The governor of Qing Zhou, Sun Yang, came from Qing Zhou to capital and introduced a teenager to the hussar general himself.</p><br/><p>The young man was only seventeen or eighteen years old. He had an athletic posture and a handsome appearance. More importantly, he had shot with such precision that it could even be described as superb.</p><br/><p>Sun Yang felt that this man was a talent that could be useful, so in order not to bury his talent, he introduced him to General of Agile Cavalry.</p><br/><p>The general himself had tested him a few times, and had been impressed by his accuracy.</p><br/><p>Regardless of whether the target was moving or quiet, no matter how fast he ran, he could quickly pull the bow and pull the arrow, hitting the target in one shot.</p><br/><p>Satisfied with him, Zhong Kai kept him in the army, starting temporarily with Chiliarch.</p><br/><p>It was Gao Xun.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun was good-looking, and he knew well of the talking skills. His eyes were bright and kind when he smiled, and soon he prospered in the army.</p><br/><p>In just a few days, he had understood the situation in the capital.</p><br/><p>He was on good terms with Zhong Shang, the eldest son of the General of Agile Cavalry.</p><br/><p>Before he joined the army, he was a playful and hedonistic young master who hung out with his cronies and friends all the time.</p><br/><p>In the end, because Zhong Kai couldn\u2019t stand it anymore, he threw him into the army to train him.</p><br/><p>A year later, even though he had cured himself of his bad habits, he was still unable to cure himself of his roguish nature. When he spoke, he grinned, and with a pair of upturned phoenix eyes, he was able to make the girls\u2019 face flush with embarrassment.</p><br/><p>After training that day, the two of them sat in the sun and Gao Xun asked, \u201cDo you know of the Xie family in capital?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang had not noticed it at all. \u201cThere are hundreds of families surnamed Xie in Beijing. I wonder which one you are talking about?\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought for a moment, \u201cThis family has a son called Xie Rong.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAnd two other girls. They\u2019re called Xie Zhen and Xie Xun.\u201d He added.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang looked at him askance. \u201cAre you talking about the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion?\u201d</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

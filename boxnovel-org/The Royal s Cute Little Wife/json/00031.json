The Sixth Prince was found seven years ago, when they claimed that the Sixth Prince and Princess He Yi was twin of a boy and a girl when they were born. The Sixth Prince had been harmed by the palace people, so his whereabouts had been unknown for many years.</p><br/><p>Actually, there was a scandal in the palace involved, and outsiders did not know the truth.</p><br/><p>Princess He Yi were not the daughter of imperial concubine Hui. She had been exchanged with the Sixth Prince and had entered the palace, enjoying her glory and wealth.</p><br/><p>Originally, when the Sixth Prince returned, she should have recovered her original identity as well. But the fact that His Majesty doted on her so much that he didn\u2019t want to release her from the palace so that he kept her title of princess.</p><br/><p>Only a few people knew about this matter.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an reluctantly said goodbye to Xie Zhen. Before leaving ,she asked, \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow about I ask Sixth Brother to send you on a journey?\u201d</p><br/><p>She really dared to say, how could Xie Zhen dare to let the prince send her? She used her family\u2019s carriage to refuse her.</p><br/><p>The female attendant bowed and tactfully reminded, \u201cPrincess, His Highness has been waiting at the door for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Sixth Prince, Yan Yu, was out on business with the Crown Prince. When he came back, he passed by the crown prince\u2019s residence and found out that Princess He Yi was also in the palace.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an stood up and dusted off her skirt before walking out.</p><br/><p>There was a carriage parked outside the crown prince\u2019s residence. The carriage was simple but not luxurious. With a single glance, one could tell that the person sitting inside was either a rich person or a noble.</p><br/><p>There were eight guards standing at the corners of the carriage, each of them well-trained, as they closely guarded the Sixth Prince\u2019s safety.</p><br/><p>When they saw Princess He Yi walking over, one by one, they bowed. One of the guards lifted the embroidered dark golden curtain to invite her in.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an bent over and entered the carriage. Lifting her eyes to take a look, she smiled and called out, \u201cSixth Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was sitting on one side of the carriage, leaning against the carriage, resting with his eyes closed.</p><br/><p>For the past few days, he had been out with the crown prince. In order to investigate the assassination attempt on the crown prince, he had seldom rested.</p><br/><p>Hearing Yan Yao\u2019an\u2019s voice, he only slightly raised his eyes, but there wasn\u2019t even the slightest emotion in his eyes. He simply asked, \u201cWhy are you so slow?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an told the driver to set off, and she lowered the curtain. \u201cWe\u2019ve been chatting with the Fifth Miss of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu closed his eyes again. He didn\u2019t even ask.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an was used to his personality. As the sixth brother of hers, she always had an expression that kept him at bay, as if nothing could affect his mood, let alone attract his attention.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know what he was thinking all day, so couldn\u2019t he say a few more words?</p><br/><p>She pursed her lips and took out the gold filigree sachet that Xie Zhen had given her, and toyed with the tassels under the sachet.</p><br/><p>In an instant, the carriage was filled with a rich fragrance. It was not strong, but it was elegant and delicate. It slowly spread and even made people feel refreshed.</p><br/><p>It was a very special fragrance. At the very least, Yan Yao\u2019an had never smelled it on anyone else\u2019s body before.</p><br/><p>The carriage moved forward slowly, leaving the crown prince\u2019s residence behind. Yan Yu was still sleeping.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an suddenly thought of something as she excitedly asked, \u201cSixth Brother, did you see the Fifth Miss when you went back to Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s more beautiful than any other girl I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu ignored her.</p><br/><p>She went on talking to herself: \u201cShe has a sister, and a pretty one too.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s still young and a little afraid of strangers \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her words reminded Yan Yu of someone else.</p><br/><p>His thoughts flew away, leaving him with only five or six years of his life.</p><br/><p>She was also a very pretty little girl, and she also had a little sister. She always called him \u201d Brother Xiao Yu\u201d with a smile, pestering him to hold hands with her.</p><br/><p>Her voice was pleasing to the ears, she could sing beautiful children\u2019s songs, and she could even carry him on her back for a very long distance \u2026</p><br/><p>He was always impatient with her, because the first time he met her she touched his crotch.</p><br/><p>What a little bastard.</p><br/><p>He wondered why, after all these years, he still couldn\u2019t forget her.</p><br/><p>Once he closed his eyes, he could clearly remember every single scene.</p><br/><p>He wondered how she looked like?</p><br/><p>She was like a little fox when she was young, but what about now?</p><br/><p>He lived in the palace, walking on thin ice at every step, trying to find out where she was, but afraid to hear from her.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was because she was too homesick, or perhaps it was because she was afraid of causing trouble for her.</p><br/><p>Unconsciously, seven years had already passed.</p><br/><p>While he was immersed in his memories, Yan Yao\u2019an was still chattering, \u201cLook, this scented sachet was given to me by her!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSixth brother, do you smell it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Seeing that Yan Yu did not react, she was not discouraged and continued, \u201cI wonder if my body will be as fragrant as hers after wearing it for so long?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe said that her sister Ah Xun had one, too, and that she made the spice by herself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, Yan Yu suddenly opened his eyes. His black pupils were no longer calm, only shock remained, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an had never seen his reaction before. She said dazedly, \u201cI said she made the spice by herself \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cNot this.\u201d Yan Yu grabbed her hand which held the sachet, asked again:\u201cWhat did you say her sister\u2019s name was?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an opened her mouth. \u201d Ah Xun, Xie Xun.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long time, only silence remained in the carriage.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu released her hand and said, \u201cStop the carriage, stop right now!\u201d</p><br/><p>The coachman was ordered to stop the carriage at the side of the road.</p><br/><p>He had originally wanted the carriage driver to turn around and return to the crown prince\u2019s mansion, but he also felt that the carriage was going too slow. Thus, he directly took Yan Yao\u2019an scented sachet from Yan Yao\u2019an\u2019s hands and strode out of the carriage.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an could no longer hold herself back. She lifted up the curtain to protest, \u201cThat\u2019s mine!\u201d</p><br/><p>When he did not hear, he let one of the guards get down from his horse, took the reins, and mounted.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t even bother to say goodbye to Yan Yao\u2019an as he directly called for his car and left in a cloud of dust.</p><br/><p>She had never seen him in such a hurry.</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an stomped her feet in anger behind him. After regaining her senses, she began to wonder why he was acting so strangely.</p><br/><p>It seemed that from the moment he heard Xie Xun\u2019s name \u2026</p><br/><p>Did he know Xie Xun?</p><br/><p>When did you meet him?</p><br/><p>When Yan Yao\u2019an said her surname was Xie, he didn\u2019t think too much about it.</p><br/><p>Until he heard the name of Xie Xun.</p><br/><p>How many people who were beautiful and had a sister named Xie Xun in the world could there were?</p><br/><p>Perhaps there were many, but at this moment, he didn\u2019t care too much. He only wanted to go back and see her.</p><br/><p>See her and see if she\u2019s the little bastard he knew.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen, Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>That hateful and adorable little girl. After so many years, all his previous possessions have been destroyed. Is she still the same as when she was young?</p><br/><p>The wind whistled noisily by his ears, but he seemed to hear her coquettish voice calling him \u201d Brother Xiao Yu\u201d.</p><br/><p>No news was good. He could suppress all his emotions to the bottom of his heart.</p><br/><p>Once he found out that she was in the capital, so close to him, he couldn\u2019t wait.</p><br/><p>There were many pedestrians on the street, so he rode his horse quickly and forced his way through.</p><br/><p>When he arrived at the crown prince\u2019s mansion, he dismounted from his horse and without waiting for the servants to tie him up, he walked straight to the courtyard, \u201cWhere did the Crown Princess set up the flowers feast?\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant was stunned, unable to reply, \u201cThis \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs Your Highness going?\u201d</p><br/><p>There were only girls there, so it didn\u2019t seem appropriate for him to go, did it?</p><br/><p>Every time the Sixth Prince came to the Crown Prince\u2019s residence, didn\u2019t he usually go to the Crown Prince?</p><br/><p>Why did you think of admiring the flowers today?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere?\u201d he repeated impatiently.</p><br/><p>The servant had no choice but to say, \u201cIn the Peony Garden, this lowly one will bring you there.\u201d</p><br/><p>He walked in a hurry, and it was not good for the servants to walk too slowly. They almost ran to take him there.</p><br/><p>However, when they arrived at the Peony Garden, they discovered that there was no one inside. The feast for admiring flowers had long since dispersed, and the girls had already returned home.</p><br/><p>The servant revealed a troubled expression, \u201cYour highness \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu stood still for a moment, holding the sachet in his hand. His knuckles were white, and he was holding it so tightly that even the sachet was deformed.</p><br/><p>Without a word, he turned around and walked out. When he reached the entrance of the crown prince\u2019s mansion, he hopped on his horse and rode in the direction of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>He had followed Yan Tao to the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion last time, so he knew where he was heading.</p><br/><p>It was calmer than before, but his hands were sweating profusely. He could barely hold the reins.</p><br/><p>His lower jaw was tight and his face expressionless. He could finally see the main gate of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>There was a horse carriage parked by the door. It should be the two people who had just returned from the crown prince\u2019s mansion. The maidservants lifted the curtains and two people alighted from the carriage.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun step down the yellow wooden stool, she still had a round apple face, with nothing change.</p><br/><p>Behind her, Xie Zhen walked slowly out.</p><br/><p>It was probably because she was tired from sitting on the carriage. She was a little tired, but it seemed Xie Xun had said to her something, and then a smile curved up on her lips, and her whole person immediately became lively.</p><br/><p>Her smile was curved and bright, just like it had been when she was a child.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He can even smell it \u2026 As he was thinking, he slipped through the crack in the door and stood in the yard, shouting, \u201cAh Zhen, Ah Yu, are you there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Soon, Xie Zhen and Li Yu came out of the house with faces full of disbelief.</p><br/><p>They had never thought that someone would come here, and this person was Gao Xun. How did he find me? Xie Zhen was so moved that tears welled up in her eyes, and she took the initiative to rush over and join him. \u201cHow did you know we were here? Only you are here? Where\u2019s my father and mother? Where are they?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun took out a piece of silk he had prepared earlier and wiped the tears from the corner of her eyes. \u201cI came with my parents. They\u2019re nearby. We\u2019ve been searching this hill for an entire morning and we\u2019ve finally found you \u2026 Don\u2019t cry, Uncle and Auntie are fine, but they\u2019re worried about you. Alright, you guys quickly come back with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded and calmed herself down, and then pulled Li Yu over. She said to Gao Xun, \u201cBrother Xiao Yu is injured. We need to find a doctor for him as soon as possible when we get back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun didn\u2019t ignore it, so he hurriedly ordered a servant to go back to Temple of Puning to get a doctor, so as to avoid wasting time.</p><br/><p>When he was done, he realized that both of them were wearing coarse hemp, especially the ponytail on Xie Zhen\u2019s head. At first glance, they really did look like little girls from the countryside. It was just that her appearance was too beautiful, and she could not conceal her natural wealth and noble temperament no matter how hard she tried.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun looked at their attire and could not help but ask with his handsome face, \u201cWhy are you guys wearing this set of clothes?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen opened her arms, and said reluctantly, \u201cour clothes have been cut by the grass. Aunt Yang lent them to us\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Wang Yang\u2019s daughter was one year younger than her. Her clothes were smaller on her body, revealing her delicate white wrists. Under the sunlight, they were as white as white jade. It was just that her wrist had been scratched with several red lines from the rough cloth. Her skin was delicate and delicate, making her unable to wear such rough clothes. However, after wearing it for the entire night, there was not a single word of complaint.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun clearly wanted to look at her hands, but he had no choice but to hold himself back. His face was red as he said, \u201cThe carriage is at the village entrance. I will bring you there right away.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he was leaving, Xie Zhen said \u201chold on\u201d.</p><br/><p>She searched her entire body and only found a small jade-green fish. She didn\u2019t know if it was worth money or not. He could only ask Gao Wenshu, \u201cDo you have any money with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun was too focused on finding them. Where would he find the money? He could not bear to disappoint him, so he searched every guard, barely gathering seven or eight taels of silver and dozens of copper coins. He fumbled around on his own body, found a jade ginseng pendant and a small pearl, and handed them all to her. \u201cOnly these valuable things, what are you going to do with them?\u201d</p><br/><p>She grinned gratefully. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you later!\u201d</p><br/><p>She turned around and ran under the eaves. Lady Wang Yang and her two children were standing in front of the door of the living room. Xie Zhen held a handful of gold and silver jewelry in front of her, and her smile was as bright as a small sun: \u201cAunt Yang, these are all for you. Thank you for treating big brother Xiao Yu, and thank you for letting us eat and sleep!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Wang Yang had never seen so many jewels in her life, so how could she dare to accept them? She nervously rejected, \u201cNo, no, it was just a small effort \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, he did not know what kind of noble people they had saved. It was only natural that he would receive such a reward.</p><br/><p>She refused to accept it, but Xie Zhen was a smart girl, so she immediately stuffed these things into Madam Wang Yang\u2019s daughter\u2019s hands. Before the other side could react, she was already far away.</p><br/><p>The little girl stood in the courtyard with her eyes curved in a smile, completely different from the dejected look she had yesterday. The warm spring sun shined on her body, coating her body with a layer of golden fur. She looked extremely soft.</p><br/><p>Madam Wang Yang was about to thank them with the two children, but they already got into the carriage and drove off.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ve really met a noble person \u2026\u201d Madam Wang Yang sighed with emotion.</p><br/><p>Sitting in the carriage on the return journey, Xie Zhen\u2019s heart immediately calmed down.</p><br/><p>The terrifying fear from yesterday was still fresh in her mind. She could still remember the widened eyes of the man in black when he died, as well as the howls of wolves one after another \u2026 She didn\u2019t expect that she would be able to escape. She even felt that she had gotten a great bargain.</p><br/><p>After the suffering, both Xie Zhen and Li Yu seemed to have become much closer to each other all of a sudden.</p><br/><p>The two of them didn\u2019t notice it themselves, but the onlookers Gao Xun could see it clearly.</p><br/><p>They sat together. Although Li Yu wasn\u2019t very excited, he didn\u2019t frown as he usually did, and he didn\u2019t ignore her. He even exchanged a few words with her. Gao Xun looked back and forth between them in surprise. He wondered what had happened to them, how their relationship had suddenly improved.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t notice his eyes at all and started to carefully care about Li Yu\u2019s injuries, \u201cBrother Xiao Yu, does it still hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu shook his head. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was almost crying, \u201cyou lost so much blood yesterday, I thought you were going to die\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When Gao Xun heard this, his eyes widened in shock. \u201cBlood?\u201d \u201cWhy are you bleeding?\u201d</p><br/><p>He remembered that he had forgotten to ask them why they had come here, what they had experienced yesterday, who had taken them away? He only knew that after the great hall of Temple of Puning was set ablaze, the maid cried out in alarm from the backyard, saying that the two of them had been kidnapped by the criminals.</p><br/><p>The couple from the Xie family and the Li family nearly fainted when they heard this. They immediately sent all of their servants to search the mountains, searching without stopping for a single night.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t until this morning when he tried everything to beg his parents for help that the Second Master of Gao family finally agreed to take him out. Who would have thought that he would actually be the one to find him.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen told him what had happened to her the day before, and he was scared, and he didn\u2019t know how they\u2019d gotten there.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun felt both heartache and admiration for her. \u201cYou carry Ah Yu on your back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu glanced at him and pursed his lips without saying anything.</p><br/><p>He asked, \u201cWho are those people?\u201d \u201cWhy should I kill you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was also confused. \u201cI don\u2019t know. However, there\u2019s one more person who helped us, and I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on \u2026 \u201cThey are clearly in the same group!\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun still wanted to ask something, but the carriage had already arrived at the village entrance and was converging with the carriage of the Second Master of Gao family.</p><br/><p>When the Second Master of Gao family learned that Gao Xun had found them, he heaved a sigh of relief. Seeing that the two children were unharmed, he hurried back to the temple to inform everyone that there was no need to look for them.</p><br/><p>Back at Temple of Puning, the Xie family and the Li family had long heard the news and rushed to the entrance of the temple to welcome them.</p><br/><p>Seeing a carriage from a distance, before it could reach them, Xie Zhen\u2019s smiling face poked out and shouted from afar, \u201cFather, Mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>At the same time, the tears of Madam Leng burst forth, tears of joy streaming down her face.</p><br/><p>They were really two children who had suffered many disasters. They had nearly met danger when walking down the street, and now, they could be robbed in a temple. Fortunately, she found it in time. Otherwise, she really didn\u2019t know how to survive.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for the carriage to steady itself, Xie Zhen impatiently rushed into Leng\u2019s arms, holding her and acting pitifully, \u201cMother, I was scared \u2026Someone is trying to kill us, and the wolf as well. Brother Xiao Yu and I are both very scared.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid. I\u2019ll protect you \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yesterday, Shuang Yu had said that they had been taken away by the black clothed men. Xie Liqing had immediately sent people to investigate the identities of those people, but the criminals had come and left without a trace. A day and a night went by without a clue.</p><br/><p>What kind of person would go against a child? Or was it because of their master\u2019s grudge, that he took revenge on the child?</p><br/><p>Madam Leng still couldn\u2019t figure it out. They had just arrived in the Qingzhou Province and they didn\u2019t have any enmity with anyone, so how could there be anyone who wanted to harm them?</p><br/><p>She forgot one thing. Xie Zhen had been taken in Li Yu\u2019s room, apparently for Li Yu\u2019s sake.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was only implicated.</p><br/><p>The Li family\u2019s couple knew this very well. After taking Li Yu from the carriage and seeing his chest injury, they both felt anxious and distressed. They carried him to the backyard of the temple.</p><br/><p>Li Yu was tired as well, so he didn\u2019t refuse and just laid on her shoulder. Looking back, just in time to see Xie Zhen like a lost lamb, nestling in the arms of Leng\u2019s rub, satisfied and aggrieved.</p><br/><p>In the backyard, the doctor opened the gauze bandages he had wrapped around his chest and made a new diagnosis. The village medicine was rough, and the herbs had not been meticulously ground and were not good for healing wounds. The doctor also prescribed two sets of medicine for external use and told him to drink and change his medicine every day so that he wouldn\u2019t have to move around too much. The wound wasn\u2019t very deep and would only take half a month to heal.</p><br/><p>Only then did the Song Family relax. After sending off the doctor, she carried Li Yu and sat on the bed, unable to recover from her shock for a long time.</p><br/><p>The atmosphere in the room was rather heavy. Li Xiqing stood by the window with her hands behind her back as if she was thinking about something.</p><br/><p>Li Yu moved in Lady Song\u2019s arms. He raised his head and asked, \u201cMother, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long time, the Song Family hugged him even tighter. With a trembling voice, they asked, \u201cYu\u2019er, what do the people you captured look like?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu was stunned. \u201cThey\u2019re covering their faces. I didn\u2019t see them.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Song asked again, \u201cWhat did they say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu tried hard to recall that the two men in black hadn\u2019t said anything along the way. When they wanted to kill him, they had said a few more words.</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said someone wanted me dead.\u201d Li Yu\u2019s voice was hoarse as he repeated slowly, \u201cHis partner said that someone was trying to kill us all\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The more Madame Song heard, the more terrified she became. She turned her pleading gaze towards Li Xiqing, who was beside the bed.</p><br/><p>Li Xiqing was also confused. He frowned and said, \u201cStay at home and have a rest, don\u2019t go anywhere. As for these matters, just leave them to me and your mother. \u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cDad, who are they? Why did you kill me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Xiqing sighed: \u201cIt\u2019s probably the sin I created in the past, it has nothing to do with you, you shouldn\u2019t think too much about it.\u201d \u201cRest well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu looked at him and nodded.</p><br/><p>In this period of time, Madam Song and Li Xiqing kept a close watch on him. In addition to the excuse of recuperating, they didn\u2019t allow him to take even half a step out of the house, and there were quite a few servants in the yard as well. Li Yu had been injured for more than half a year, but he had actually recovered a long time ago. It was just that Madam Song and Li Xiqing claimed that he was not well and that no one should visit him.</p><br/><p>Li Yu lay in bed almost sick, occasionally remembering the two black braids that Xie Zhen had in the farmyard, and the scene of her crying and calling him \u201cdon\u2019t die\u201d.</p><br/><p>He asked, \u201ccan I go to the Xie family?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Song said, \u201cAh Zhen was also frightened. I think we should go there in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not speak again.</p><br/><p>In the blink of an eye it was winter, and he had only met with Xie Zhen once before, on the day Xie Liqing celebrated his birthday. Without time to talk to him, Xie Zhen smiled at him from a distance and was led away by Leng.</p><br/><p>The weather was getting colder and colder day by day. After a heavy snowfall, the entire Qingzhou Province was completely covered in white and a vast expanse of whiteness was everywhere.</p><br/><p>On this day, Li Yu was sitting under the portico, reading a book by the fire. On the other side of the wall was the noisy laughter of Xie Zhen and Xie Xun, making it impossible for him to calm down. Just as he was about to stand under the wall and protest, a maidservant called out to him, \u201cYoung master, the cousin mistress are here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu subconsciously frowned. Obviously, he was extremely unhappy.</p><br/><p>The maidservant then said, \u201cMadam requests that you go to the main room.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that he couldn\u2019t hide anymore, so he could only drop the book and slowly follow behind the maidservant.</p><br/><p>As soon as he arrived at the living room, a seven or eight year old girl rushed out from within. She wore a silver and red flowery jacket and a cotton dress. Her voice was loud and cheerful, \u201cCousin, you\u2019re finally here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu retreated repeatedly, almost being knocked to the ground by her.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

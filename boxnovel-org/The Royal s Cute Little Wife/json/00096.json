He was still fine at that time. How long had it been? Why was he going to die?</p><br/><p>She stood up suddenly, barely able to calm her mind, and asked the servant maid who sent the message: \u201cWho told you this? Where did you get the information from, and where is that person? \u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun had come to the manor a few times because the servant maid recognized Gao Xun. At this moment, her reply was also trembling as she said, \u201cI heard it from the people at the Clear Peace Inn \u2026 They said that Young Master Gao was unconscious in the tavern, and the shopkeeper could not find his family, so he asked about the sixth prince Palace from him.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen felt his vision blur, and he almost lost his balance. \u201cYou, bring me over to take a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t believe that this was true, that Gao Xun was still alive and kicking a few days ago, so how was he going to die? Since young, his body had always been the strongest. She was prone to sickness, and every time she became sick, Gao Xun would jump onto her bedside to show her his healthy body after practicing martial arts. He even earnestly and earnestly told her that eating more would prevent him from getting sick.</p><br/><p>He, what had happened to him \u2026 That\u2019s why it\u2019s so serious?</p><br/><p>servant maids led the way, \u201cEmpress, follow your servant.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had only walked a few steps when he heard a question coming from behind him.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen suddenly stopped and turned around to look back.</p><br/><p>Just as Yan Yu woke up, and heard movement outside the house, he put on his shoes and socks and walked to in the porch, only to see her walking frantically towards the exit. He was curious for a moment and called her to stop. He was wearing the Raven Green Precious Flower robe, standing straight at the door. When he saw Xie Zhen\u2019s face, he was immediately stunned.</p><br/><p>He walked up to her and wiped the tears from the corners of her eyes. \u201cWhat are you crying for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t even know that she was crying. She raised her hand to feel it and sure enough, her face was wet. She sniffed and spoke with bloodshot eyes: \u201cGao Xun is going to die \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu froze.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen repeated everything that she had heard from the servant maids. Although she had no feelings for Gao Xun, she was still a friend who had grown up together with him. If she could only watch as Gao Xun died, she would definitely not be able to do it.</p><br/><p>After listening to what she had to say, Yan Yu frowned and asked, \u201cHow did the people at the inn know that Gao Xun knows us?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen explained: \u201cI heard that the shopkeeper asked him before.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he realized that something was wrong.</p><br/><p>If the shopkeeper had asked Gao Xun and his parents were not in the capital, he would have said camp first and Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion next. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn\u2019t say the word \u201cAn Wang\u2019s Mansion\u201d.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t give her any trouble.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen understood Gao Xun very well, Gao Xun had never wanted her to worry, so even if there was something he did not want to trouble her with.</p><br/><p>Then this was \u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought left and right, clearly knowing that something was wrong, yet unable to think of a reasonable explanation. She would only know what was going on if she saw it with her own eyes.</p><br/><p>The carriage was already prepared outside the door. She looked at Yan Yu and hesitated: \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Yan Yu also felt that there was a problem, he had no choice but to go. What if something really happened to Gao Xun? After all, they were old friends from a young age. No matter how much conflict and disagreement there was, he could not abandon him.</p><br/><p>Instead, Yan Yu held her hand and led her outside with large strides: \u201cI\u2019ll go with you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen blankly sighed, and called out to him: \u201cBut weren\u2019t you grounded? How can I get out? \u201d</p><br/><p>He had been confined within the Emperor Yuan Hui for two months, and it had only been a little more than a month. If he were to leave just like that and spread the news to His Majesty\u2019s ears, what would happen to His Majesty? Moreover, there were guards at the front door, so even if he wanted to leave, he wouldn\u2019t be able to. It was not that Xie Zhen didn\u2019t want to go with him, but Xie Zhen had to give up after realizing that there was no other way.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu paused, he thought for a moment, then brought her to the other side: \u201cLet\u2019s go through the back door.\u201d</p><br/><p>The backdoor that Yan Yu had mentioned was not the one that servant had gone out from, but a separate side door that had been opened on his own. Behind the door was a small river, on both sides of the river bank were planted willow trees, and it was a good place to stay in during the summer. Yan Yu had previously planned to come here with Xie Zhen to enjoy the cool, but he never thought that it would actually have other uses today. He brought her out of the door, and before long, the carriage from the mansion arrived. The two of them got on the carriage and headed towards the Clear Peace Inn.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>At the Clear Peace Inn, Lin Huapin sat in an inconspicuous corner on the first floor.</p><br/><p>She waited for an hour before she finally saw An Wang\u2019s Mansion\u2019s carriage through the window.</p><br/><p>servant maids helped Xie Zhen down from the horse carriage, she smiled, and made a posture of watching a good show.</p><br/><p>She was the only one out of the carriage, it seemed like she had left without knowing anything about Yan Yu.</p><br/><p>There was an endless stream of guests at the Clear Peace Inn, which was why Xie Zhen could not see her table. She saw Xie Zhen ask the shopkeeper something, and the shopkeeper pointed in the direction of a room on the east side of the tower. She thanked him and went upstairs.</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin purposely waited downstairs for a while before going up.</p><br/><p>She estimated that it was about time, and brought servant maids up to the second floor. Gao Xun\u2019s room was at the easternmost area of the corridor, making it extremely recognizable. When she walked over, the door was tightly shut, and she could not see what was inside. She lit a incense in the room, the spices contained a aphrodisiac element, as long as Xie Zhen walked into the room, she would not have a pure reputation.</p><br/><p>As long as she opened this door, she would no longer be able to be the lofty An Wang Fei \u2026</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin\u2019s heart was filled with hatred and envy, to the point that her face was twisted slightly. She almost could not hold back her laughter as she reached out her hand to push open the door.</p><br/><p>The door was silent. Only the fragrance lingered in the air.</p><br/><p>She stopped smiling and felt that something was wrong. Subconsciously, she walked inside. But she had only taken two steps when the door slammed behind her with a bang.</p><br/><p>Startled, she hurried to the door and pushed it open. \u201cWho\u2019s outside? Open the door and let me out! \u201d</p><br/><p>There was no response from outside the door, only the clear sound of a lock falling.</p><br/><p>Her heart turned cold.</p><br/><p>What was going on? Why was it different from what she had imagined?</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin was panicking so much that the door creaked open, but no one came to open the door for her. She gradually lost control of her emotions and raised her voice. \u201cOpen the door! Open the door! \u201d</p><br/><p>The incense on the table wafted into her nose, and by the time she realized it, it was too late.</p><br/><p>As her head began to grow dizzy and her hands and feet became uncontrollable, she continued to shout frantically, \u201cOpen the door for me! \u201cOpen the door\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She slid down the door, feeling her body grow weirder and weirder.</p><br/><p>She felt very itchy. As for where it was itchy, she could not tell.</p><br/><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she caught a glimpse of a person walking out. She squinted, but she couldn\u2019t see his features clearly. He walked up to her, picked her up, and carried her inside.</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin continued to struggle, but she seemed to be extremely weak, and the person still placed her on the bed.</p><br/><p>In the end, her consciousness was in chaos.</p><br/><p>His body felt like it was being controlled by someone else. It was both painful and hot, and waves of intense feelings were surging up to the top of his head. She was crying and struggling to beg for mercy, but the person on her body acted as if she didn\u2019t hear it. Time after time, he pushed her to the peak.</p><br/><p>She bit her lip and her throat was hoarse, but still no one came to her rescue.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Actually, after Xie Zhen went upstairs, he did not enter Gao Xun\u2019s room, but instead stopped outside the door. Just as he was about to let servant maids go in and take a look, he was carried by a hand to the room next door.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu followed her up. He originally wanted to shout out loud, but when he saw the owner of the hands, he called out in surprise, \u201cYoung Master Gao?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun released Xie Zhen and said with embarrassment: \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not expect Xie Zhen to really come back.</p><br/><p>From the moment he woke up and saw Lin Huapin, he felt that something was amiss. It was only when Lin Huapin said that she had been good friends with Xie Zhen for many years, that he was able to confirm that Lin Huapin was just spouting nonsense. Xie Zhen had only come to capital at the beginning of last year, she had always been there. How could she have known Xie Zhen for so long?</p><br/><p>Therefore, when Lin Huapin said that Xie Zhen wanted to come, he became cautious.</p><br/><p>He asked Xie Zhen: \u201cWhy are you here? Do you really know Lin Huapin? \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not understand what relation she had with Lin Huapin. She sized him up and upon seeing that he was alright, she then said, \u201cSomeone sent me a letter. They said that you were almost done for, so how could I not come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun\u2019s eyes lit up, \u201cYou care about me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She tilted her head, not wanting to give him any unnecessary hope, and pulled away, \u201cIt was Big Brother Xiao Yu who brought me here. Since it\u2019s inconvenient for him to come out, he decided to let me take a look \u2026 \u201d Then, he suddenly thought of something and raised his head to ask, \u201cIf you are fine, then why did you falsify the information?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun smiled, pointed at the wall and said to her: \u201cI woke up in the room next door, and when I woke up, there was a girl called Lin Huapin. She said that she had a good relationship with you \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen frowned and interrupted his words: \u201cI have never had a relationship with her before.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026. It looked like Gao Xun was right.</p><br/><p>He was relieved and told her the whole story. She probably wanted to lure you over, then light incense in the house to frame the two of us. \u201cJust accept it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun originally wanted to say adulterous, but later on, he changed his way of speaking to euphemism because he was afraid that the word would frighten Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>But Xie Zhen was still shocked.</p><br/><p>This Lin Huapin\u2026 What a vicious snake\u2019s heart!</p><br/><p>Her father had already been reduced to a ninth rank official, yet she was still so restless. Wasn\u2019t it more important for her family to be at a loss for what to do?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen frowned, \u201cIs she in this inn? \u201cHow did she know you had something to do with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun could not say that he had called her by her name when he was drunk, he coughed, and was about to explain himself when he heard the voices of a man and a woman coming from the room next door. He had never heard the man\u2019s voice before, the woman\u2019s cry \u2026 Xie Zhen heard it and quickly recognized it was Lin Huapin\u2019s voice. She opened her mouth wide: \u201cThis is \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun turned his head, and didn\u2019t dare meet her gaze. \u201cWhat she planned to do to you \u2026 I\u2019m just returning it to her. \u201d</p><br/><p>The sound continued to come from the other side of the wall. Xie Zhen understood and for some reason, his ears turned red as he stood far away from the wall, \u201cThen \u2026 \u201cAnd the man in the house is?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun said: \u201cThe shop assistant at the inn.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>If Lin Huapin woke up, he didn\u2019t know how vexed he would be.</p><br/><p>They were obviously scheming against Xie Zhen, but who would have thought that they would be tricked instead!</p><br/><p>Furthermore, all of this was planned by her. Even if she wanted to find someone to make the decision, it would be difficult to say. Just why would she appear in the tavern? Why did she appear in Gao Xun\u2019s room? Why is there a scent in this room? Even if she had a long mouth, she wouldn\u2019t be able to say it clearly.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Yan Yu waited in the carriage for a moment, and when he did not see Xie Zhen coming out, he took the risk of being severely punished by the Emperor Yuan Hui and left the carriage.</p><br/><p>He walked up to the second floor and saw two guards dressed in their usual attire standing in front of Gao Xun\u2019s room.</p><br/><p>These two were his subordinates. Just now, when Xie Zhen went upstairs, Yan Yu asked the two to follow him. If Xie Zhen was in danger, they could block the way and protect her.</p><br/><p>They were standing straight in the doorway.</p><br/><p>Just now, Xie Zhen had brought Xie Zhen into the room, the two of them originally wanted to go against him, but stopped after knowing that he and Xie Zhen knew each other. And after Lin Huapin entered the room, it was the two of them who locked the door.</p><br/><p>If it were not for them, Lin Huapin would have already escaped from inside.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu went forward to understand the whole situation, turned his head to look at the door, and just happened to hear a sharp wail from inside.</p><br/><p>He frowned and walked toward the room next door with turn around his body.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen and Gao Xun were in the middle of an awkward situation when they heard the door being pushed open. They looked over at the same time and saw Yan Yu standing at the entrance with a serious face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

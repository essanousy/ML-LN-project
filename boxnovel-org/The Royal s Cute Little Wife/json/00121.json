Yan Yu also bestowed upon his son and daughter the position of royal highness and infanta, so as to avoid having to do it again in the future. Moreover, the eldest son was supposed to be chosen as the royal highness. The longer the time passed, the worse it would be. In the future, since he would have more sons, they might even start a conflict over such a small matter. It would be better to stop their thoughts and wholeheartedly respect their elder brother.</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t know if he and Xie Zhen would have any more children in the future \u2026</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t bear to let her suffer that kind of pain, so he decided not to think about it for the time being and let nature take its course. Even if they didn\u2019t, these two were still pretty good.</p><br/><p>After thinking about it, he returned back to the An Wang\u2019s Mansion from the palace and told Xie Zhen about the name, \u201cYour son is called Yan Jin.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen could not help but scratch his face, and almost fainted, \u201cHow can you be so hasty! Can\u2019t I think about it a little more? I have several options here, you. Did you get distracted by the name you gave them? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu acknowledged her with a light grunt, then bent down to hold her in his arms. He rubbed his chin on her head and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go, father has given her a good name, it has a profound meaning to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was still in her month, so she could not get out of bed. She could only eat and drink in her bed every day. He was the one who served her with all the important matters. Xie Zhen did not want him to help, so she insisted for Shuang Yan\u2019s help with her flushed face and told him to go out. He stood beside the bed like a wooden log, refusing to go out no matter what. When he saw her red face from holding back, he simply picked her up horizontally and personally placed her on the bucket in concubine.</p><br/><p>Considering the inconvenience of her body, she had specially prepared a bucket at concubine. Every two hours, there would be a servant maids to take care of it.</p><br/><p>But this did not mean that Xie Zhen would not feel awkward.</p><br/><p>He was just a few steps away from her. He could clearly hear her gentle voice. Even if he didn\u2019t personally see it, he would still feel embarrassed!</p><br/><p>After he finished, Xie Zhen was about to pull up his pants. Because the wound there was not fully healed, it would still hurt if he stood up. She had barely taken a breath when he came in from outside and put on her underpants without a change of expression.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was distressed, \u201cDon\u2019t, don\u2019t \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He squatted on the ground and raised his head to look at her. His handsome eyebrows slightly raised as he faintly smiled. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you shy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Once Xie Zhen said that, his face turned even redder, just like a persimmon that had matured in the early autumn. She stammered, unable to speak. She buried her head in his neck and moaned, \u201cPa, pa \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu quickly understood. He took the handkerchief from the wooden shelf and wiped it off carefully for her before putting on his underpants. That place was soft and tender, and because it had been torn just before, the handkerchief used the softest material, so they were not worried that it would hurt her.</p><br/><p>After doing some of it, Xie Zhen was already too embarrassed to look anyone in the eye, her face red to the point of dripping blood. No matter how much she tried to resist, it was useless. Every time she tried to solve the problem, he would personally serve her. So much so that Xie Zhen felt that the gazes of the servant maids s were somewhat ambiguous and unclear.</p><br/><p>Her thoughts flew off into the distance. She was clearly quarreling over the names of a pair of children when she suddenly lost her train of thought. When he saw her blushing, he asked with a smile, \u201cWhat did you remember?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen hurriedly came back to reality and felt that he was smiling maliciously. He shifted his gaze away and said with a lack of confidence, \u201cAnyway, it has already been decided \u2026 \u201cThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s it.\u201d He knew that it was useless to resist, so he had no choice but to give up. He thought for a moment and could not help but mutter: \u201cThen I\u2019ll just call them by their nickname. Little carp lambs, or Su and Jin, they are much more pleasing to the ears than Yan Jin.\u201d</p><br/><p>In this aspect, Yan Yu would never argue with her. As long as she liked him, it was fine.</p><br/><p>After all, as a father\u2019s mother, he seemed to have grown a lot in one night. Yan Yu\u2019s performance was especially obvious. It was probably because they had two children all at once and had a small, delicate wife to take care of. Therefore, they had to mature quickly so that their shoulders could bear the weight of the three of them.</p><br/><p>After lying on the bed for more than twenty days, Xie Zhen was finally able to get off the bed and walk around.</p><br/><p>She had been lying in bed for the past few days, unable to take a bath or wash her hair. She couldn\u2019t even bear it herself, and it was really hard for her to hug Yan Yu for the sake of her sleeping every night. There was no disgust on her face at all, as a loving expression could melt a person.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had pushed him out of bed many times, but he couldn\u2019t take it anymore, \u201cGo sleep on the bed!\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, his expression looked a little injured. He was unwilling to move, so he held her hand and said in a low voice, \u201cI want to accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though Xie Zhen\u2019s heart of stone had hardened, at this moment, he had completely given in.</p><br/><p>She sighed and moved closer. \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>His thin lips curled up into a smile, and he was content to share the bed with her.</p><br/><p>Now that Xie Zhen could get off the bed, it meant that he could take a bath. She sat in the bath barrel for more than an hour. Her hair had been washed countless times, and her body was also covered with soapy pods. She even dripped a few drops of lotus flower honey into the water. She was finally able to wash her hair properly. Shuang Yu helped her put on a clean set of clothes. The weather was still very hot and she was only wearing a moon-white cotton summer gown with Du Ruwei.</p><br/><p>She sat in the in the porch while Shuang Yu wiped her hair behind her. She asked the wet nurse to bring the two children over.</p><br/><p>It had already been almost a month, and in a few days, there would be a feast of a full moon. According to Emperor Yuan Hui, it would be held in the palace. Xie Zhen did not want to act in such a grand manner originally, she just needed to invite a few people into the mansion. She was not a prince, and doing this would attract too much attention. Unfortunately, the emperor\u2019s orders could not be disobeyed. These words could only be imagined in her heart.</p><br/><p>Both Su and Jin were still awake, one yawning and the other bubbling in the cradle of bamboo. The bubble popped and saliva dripped onto Su Ming\u2019s face.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen laughed out loud, and used a handkerchief to wipe his face, \u201cLittle idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>The older brother was clearly more lively than the younger sister. He also had more expressions. Sometimes he would grin, sometimes he would stick out his tongue. He was having a lot of fun playing with himself. His sister was clearly not as noisy as him. Perhaps it was because she hadn\u2019t slept enough in her mother\u2019s womb, and now she loved to sleep very much. She slept almost twenty hours a day, so it was really difficult to see her awake. Even when he woke up, his big black eyes were still in a trance, ignoring his brother\u2019s \u201cla la la la\u201d sound, occasionally being teased by Xie Zhen, before he started chuckling.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen waved a rattle drum in front of Ah Jin, and the rattle drum emitted a \u201cdong dong\u201d sound. Ah Jin\u2019s eyes also followed her hands, she was extremely focused, and couldn\u2019t help but laugh when she saw it. Xie Zhen finally saw through it. His brother was lively and moved, his sister was a wooden stake, but he was very interested in the sound of her voice. The Madam Leng came over once when they were sitting down, and hugged Ah Jin as he asked, \u201cWhy does this look a bit like Ronger when he was young \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong was like this when he was young, when he was still a carrot, he was different from other children, he did not like to talk, and would occasionally be very focused.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen felt that there was nothing bad about it, it was better if every child\u2019s personality was different. If they were all the same, what would be the point? In any case, she liked the two kids just as much. She just felt that Ah Jin was a little thin and weak, so the wet nurse would usually take care of her a little more.</p><br/><p>Just as she was making fun of him, the person wiping her hair behind her suddenly changed. She tilted her head and looked at him with a smile, \u201cWhen did Big Brother Xiao Yu come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu rubbed her half-dry hair. After doing these trivial things, she had actually become very familiar with them. Just a moment ago. \u201d</p><br/><p>Today, he entered the palace to discuss with Emperor Yuan Hui about the Full Moon Feast. Emperor Yuan Hui\u2019s body was getting worse and worse every day, so he was afraid that he wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on through this winter. When people grew old, they would like to be lively. They wanted to take advantage of the final opportunity to make a big scene for their grandchildren, so the scene was very grand and they invited many civil officials.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu checked the names on the list and returned from the palace without any questions.</p><br/><p>He liked to go home and watch Xie Zhen tease the two children. His heart was filled with an indescribable joy.</p><br/><p>After drying his hair, he combed it with a rhinoceros\u2019s horn. Occasionally he tugged at her hair and she complained, \u201cA little more.\u201d</p><br/><p>He immediately exerted light force.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen reached out his hands to play with the two little fellows. A Su grabbed onto one of her fingers and gnawed on it, causing her hands to be covered in sticky saliva. She was such a clean person, yet she actually didn\u2019t mind. She arched her eyebrows and smiled, her voice was soft and pleasant, like the passing wind. It was refreshing and comfortable to blow on people\u2019s bodies.</p><br/><p>When the full moon banquet was held, there was a feast being held in the palace. Xie Zhen and Yan Yu carried the two children away.</p><br/><p>The and Emperor Yuan Hui had never seen each other before. The Crown Prince and Crown Princess had never had children, so she wanted to hug her grandson for a long time. He couldn\u2019t bear to let go, so he held her in his arms and teased her.</p><br/><p>Empress Wang liked boys, so he looked at A Su\u2019s face carefully and said: \u201cEveryone says that son is like mother, this child really looks like Ah Zhen.\u201d</p><br/><p>Su did his best not to cry after entering the palace. He smiled when he saw someone. He was incredibly adorable.</p><br/><p>Empress Wang loved him so much that he was unwilling to return the favor to Xie Zhen even at a banquet.</p><br/><p>In contrast, A\u2019ge on the other hand was the one being ignored, but the child was still too young, so she did not know what to do. She curled up in Xie Zhen\u2019s embrace with her eyes closed, occasionally smacking her lips, and her entire body filled with the fragrance of milk.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, Emperor Yuan Hui liked his granddaughter. A\u2019ge looked like Yan Yu, whether it was her nose or eyes, like she was carved out of the same mold. Unfortunately, his body wasn\u2019t well, and it wouldn\u2019t be long before he pressed his hands together. He could only return it to Xie Zhen, and continuously said three \u201cokay\u201d words.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

He would act just like when he was young. After holding it in for half a day, he would have said, \u201cDo you want to come to my house to fly a kite?\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that he had come to his senses, it was different.</p><br/><p>They were a couple who would want to spend their lives face to face, and if he didn\u2019t admit he was wrong, Xie Zhen would never forgive him.</p><br/><p>If Xie Zhen didn\u2019t forgive him, she would ignore him as she did today, and he cannot stand the treatment.</p><br/><p>So, ashamed and disgraced as he was, he said it anyway.</p><br/><p>After he finished speaking, he looked around at the surrounding servant maids and said with an unfriendly tone, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were eight servant maids in the room, four of whom were brought from Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion by Xie Zhen, Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan, Hong Mei and Tan Mei.</p><br/><p>They\u2019d been working for Xie Zhen for years, and they were good at it.</p><br/><p>The other four were the servant maids of the sixth prince\u2019s Mansion, Qing Xia, Sun Ya, Cui Xiu, and Lv Ao.</p><br/><p>These four servant maids were quite clever and had very neat appearances. But when they were serving the princess, they still didn\u2019t got to know well about her tempers.</p><br/><p>With such an order from Yan Yu, the other servant maids knew that he would not hurt Xie Zhen, so they lowered their heads and retreated. Only one of them remained standing.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu frowned, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>That servant maids was Qing Xia, the most beautiful one of the servant maids. She obediently replied, \u201cYour Highness and the Empress are both angry. What if your relationship with the Empress is damaged \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe servant begs you to remain in the room.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu frowned, \u201cWho allowed you to make your own decision?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cGet out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Qing Xia was startled. She raised her head and looked at him. Perhaps she was scolded, so tears quickly filled her eyes.</p><br/><p>She bowed her head and said, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, she bowed and left. From the looks of her back, she seemed rather pitiful.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Yan Yu was a person who didn\u2019t know how to appreciate relationships with women, and he also didn\u2019t pity women. If he did, then he probably wouldn\u2019t force Xie Zhen and himself to such a state.</p><br/><p>After everyone had left, he looked into Xie Zhen\u2019s eyes, and when he saw she didn\u2019t respond, but looked thoughtfully at the door, and he was instantly annoyed. \u201cDid you hear what I just said?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen retreated her gaze before subconsciously relpying. \u201cYeah?\u201d</p><br/><p>Right after she said that, his face turned black once again.</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen came back to herself, she said straight to the point, \u201cWell, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>This person was even more arrogant than others when he apologized.</p><br/><p>He said it was his fault, and Xie Zhen waited most of the day without waiting for him to say what was his fault.</p><br/><p>Did he think that just by saying \u201cit\u2019s my fault\u201d, he would be able to finish it?</p><br/><p>If she allowed him to fool her so easily, then in the future, how could her position in the family still remain?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not expect her to chase after him relentlessly. What\u2019s wrong with him?</p><br/><p>What would he say?</p><br/><p>He pursed his thin lips. \u201cDon\u2019t you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing those words, she was truly angered to death!</p><br/><p>Of course she knew, she was afraid that he didn\u2019t know!</p><br/><p>Only after he said that would he be able to realize what he had done wrong and correct himself in the future.</p><br/><p>But it was hard to pry a word out of him, and Xie Zhen gave him a hard look, thinking she was a fool if she still hoped for him.</p><br/><p>She turned and left the room, and he went after her. \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t answer.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu strode up to her, one hand holding the screen, the other holding the wall to block her way. \u201cYou didn\u2019t forgive me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought it was funny, and then curved her lips. \u201cIt is not your fault.\u201d she said. \u201cWhy should I forgive you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He came to understand her now, and knew she was angry.</p><br/><p>The room was so quiet he couldn\u2019t help putting his hands down and trying to hold her, but he was afraid she would get even angrier. \u201cXie Zhen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was a little pitiful.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen ignored him.</p><br/><p>He lower his eyes and said, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have left you in the house last night.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had her head down, her expression unreadable, and all he could see were two rows of long eyelashes.</p><br/><p>He went on apologetically: \u201cI came back too late.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t drink cross-cupped wine with you. \u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to drink cross-cupped wine with you.\u201d she finally said.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu pretended to not hear it, but no longer easily angry because he got used to being dissed by her.</p><br/><p>These words seemed to give him a way out. He had the servant maids immediately prepare two cups of wine to serve to him in order to make up for last night\u2019s etiquette.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, Hong Mei walked into the inner room with a tray in her hands. On the tray were two golden wine cups filled with fine wine; it was a high-quality Shaoxing wine.</p><br/><p>She bowed. \u201cYour Highness, the Empress, here is the wine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu told her to put down the wine, \u201cYou can leave now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hong Mei placed the tray on the square table next to lady couch and left.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu walked over by holding Xie Zhen\u2019s hand. They sat side by side. He handed her a cup of wine and took one for himself.</p><br/><p>He caught her eye and quickly moved it away. \u201cAfter drinking cross-cupped wine</p><br/><p>We are the real couple. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought in her heart. Who wanted to be a real wife with him?</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t been willing to marry each other from the start.</p><br/><p>But she didn\u2019t say it, because he\u2019d hooked his arm around her arm and poured the wine down his throat.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen restrained eyesign, and took the cup to her mouth, tasted it with her tongue, and felt it was so strong that she frowned.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Yan Yu had already finished his drink, she did not think too much about it and instead imitated him to drink it all in one gulp.</p><br/><p>The wine slid down her throat into her stomach. It was the first time for her to drink wine, so she coughed fiercely.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu quickly put down his cup and patted her back, \u201cAre you better now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve never had a drink before? \u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head.</p><br/><p>They were close together, the way he was patting her back, looked like he was holding her, and his heart softened. \u201cXie Zhen, will you forgive me?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, after waiting for a long time, he still did not hear her reply.</p><br/><p>He was frustrated and ruffled. How would she forgive him?</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t go too far \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he finish speaking, she fell into his arms.</p><br/><p>Stunned, he hugged her helplessly, not knowing where to put his hands.</p><br/><p>Her body was small and soft, her head buried in his stomach, looking so cute.</p><br/><p>\u201d Xie Zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>He tried to call her, but she didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>He called again, \u201cLittle bastard?\u201d</p><br/><p>Still no reaction.</p><br/><p>He turned her so that she might not be suffocated, and turned her to face him.</p><br/><p>She was unable to drink properly. After drinking a cup, her face turned red and her eyebrows knitted together. Her delicate mouth slightly opened as she moaned in discomfort.</p><br/><p>He touched her cheek and lowered his voice. \u201d Little Lamb?\u201d</p><br/><p>She actually agreed to it. \u201cHmm \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she managed to move into his arms, found a comfortable position, and curled into a ball.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was startled at first and thought she had woken up. When he saw that she was still drunk, his heart felt incredibly soft.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t dare to scream too loudly for fear of waking her up, so he covered her ears and said again, \u201d Little Lamb \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou marry me and you\u2019re so unhappy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Fearing that she would not feel well lying out, Yan Yu carried her to the bed in the inner room.</p><br/><p>She kept moving, tugging at the lapel of her dress and raving, calling her mother, calling her sister Ah Xun.</p><br/><p>She called everyone she knew, but didn\u2019t call him.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu decided not to leave and just sat beside the bed, watching her while she was drunk.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t know that she was so light that she could be knocked down with a single glass of wine. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t drink cross-cupped wine with her last night. Otherwise, if others saw this, wouldn\u2019t they laugh?</p><br/><p>Thinking of this, he actually smiled.</p><br/><p>She held his sleeve in the palm of her hand, and he stared at her small, jade-like hand, itching for a moment, and then he opened her fingers and put his hand inside.</p><br/><p>When she did, she held him as tightly as she had held him when he was a child, but he was still not satisfied, so he intertwined his fingers with hers, entwined them, and did not want to let go.</p><br/><p>During this time, Yan Yu gave her a cup of tea. She made a ruckus for a while before finally calming down.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was rubbing her fingernails with his head. She suddenly murmured, \u201d Brother Xiao Yu \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at her steadily.</p><br/><p>She rubbed her eyes with her other hand and said slowly, \u201cWhy.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last few words were too light for him to hear clearly.</p><br/><p>He rolled over and wrapped her under him, his arm over her head. \u201d Xie Zhen, speak again?\u201d</p><br/><p>She sobbed and shook her head.</p><br/><p>Men and women\u2019s weigh was so different. He weighed her down so heavily that she was breathless.</p><br/><p>He had to keep his legs on either side of her, his body hanging above her, and he kept asking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the why?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSpeak it clearly.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, Xie Zhen\u2019s mind was in a state of confusion. How could she understand what he was asking \u2026</p><br/><p>All she knew was that she had a headache and wanted to get a good night\u2019s sleep, but someone was holding her back, buzzing in her ear.</p><br/><p>She said, \u201cDon\u2019t be noisy,\u201d and it were clear, and she pursed her lips and fell into a deep sleep.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu helplessly pressed his hand to her forehead, clenched his teeth and said, \u201cI don\u2019t mind you are noisy, but you actually dare to despise me first.\u201d</p><br/><p>She did not answer, but slept soundly.</p><br/><p>Unwilling to give up, Yan Yu bent over and bit her on the cheek without any forewarning.</p><br/><p>Her face was smooth and tender, and her teeth scraped gently. She did not feel any pain, but rather a little itch.</p><br/><p>This sound was soft and soft, and the long note dragged into his heart, making him want to eat her in one gulp.</p><br/><p>He took another bite, not too loudly, deliberately making her sound like a spoiled child.</p><br/><p>In the end, he couldn\u2019t take it anymore. His whole body felt weak, and he couldn\u2019t help but place his palm on her waist, sliding down bit by bit.</p><br/><p>There were two shallow teeth marks on her face, and he licked them, wetting her entire face before long.</p><br/><p>Nothing out of the ordinary happened in the end, but he ate up all the parts of her that he could touch all through the night.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had a strange dream at night.</p><br/><p>In the dream, a big dog suddenly rushed into her house and threw her onto the ground without any explanation. She didn\u2019t even have time to struggle before her face was covered with saliva.</p><br/><p>Not only that, the dog licked her face down to her neck and even her hands.</p><br/><p>She tried to resist, but her hands and feet were too weak to do anything but let it do as it pleased.</p><br/><p>When she woke up the next day, facing the morning light outside the window, she was still in a trance. She couldn\u2019t tell if he was dreaming or reality.</p><br/><p>She smelled her hands, and they smelt odd.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu came in from outside and she asked, \u201cDid you have a dog in the yard last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu shook her head curiously. \u201cI didn\u2019t see a dog come in.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with miss?\u201d</p><br/><p>She sat up and tucked her hair behind her ears. Her small face was wrinkled like a bun\u2019s, and she said bitterly, \u201cI guess I sweated a lot at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI feel I stink. I want to take a bath first. \u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu answered. \u201cThen I\u2019ll let the servants prepare it.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019ll probably take a while. Let\u2019s eat breakfast before taking a bath, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>She put down the washbasin and stepped forward to put on her shoes.</p><br/><p>She rubbed the space between her eyebrows, thinking back to the scene from last night. She was still a little confused. \u201cHow did I fall asleep last night?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy don\u2019t I have any memory of it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu replied, \u201cYou and His Highness drank the cross-cupped wine together. When I came in, you were already asleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>She finally remembered to ask, \u201cWhat about him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHis Highness got up early and practice his swordsmanship. His Highness is now outside and waiting for you for the morning meal.\u201d</p><br/><p>After changing clothes and washing her face and rinsing her mouth, she casually tied her hair into a concentric bun and followed Shuang Yu out for a meal.</p><br/><p>It was chilly in the morning, and she was wearing an embroidered silk blouse and a colorful skirt. As she walked, she wiped her face with a wet handkerchief and walked out of the inner room, meeting Yan Yu\u2019s gaze.</p><br/><p>He sat here for quite a while. After practicing his swordsmanship, he wore a long robe with green flowers wrapped around it. His eyes were clear and bright, and he looked even more refreshed than before.</p><br/><p>A few plates of porridge cakes sat on the table, untouched. He was waiting for her.</p><br/><p>Seeing her coming, he took the initiative to speak first, \u201cSit down. We\u2019ll go back to Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion after the breakfast.\u201d</p><br/><p>They were supposed to go home on the third day of marriage, but that day he asked Xie Zhen, and Xie Zhen said she would return home today, and in an effort to please her, he agreed.</p><br/><p>When he thought about it this morning, he hurriedly asked the steward to prepare the return gifts. Fortunately, the steward was efficient and had already prepared everything in the morning.</p><br/><p>After hearing this, Xie Zhen\u2019s eyes lit up and finally let out a smile that he hadn\u2019t seen for a long time. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow long will we stay there?\u201d</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cOne day.\u201d</p><br/><p>She wilted and sat silently across from him.</p><br/><p>He saw she kept wiping her face with a handkerchief, so asked, \u201cWhat happened to your face?\u201d</p><br/><p>She said, \u201cIt was like being bitten and licked by something last night, and my face was sticky.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was stunned for a moment before he lowered his head. A trace of guilt flashed across his face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

With a cold face, he asked again, \u201cI asked you, what did you say to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you deaf?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, no matter how foolish she was, it was impossible for her to hide it.</p><br/><p>In addition, the sixth prince was in a rage. His sharp eyes made her heart shudder and her heart tremble as she knelt on the ground. At this moment, she still wanted to hide it, \u201cYour Highness \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI am just talking about family matters with the Empress \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was not someone to be fooled. With a wave of his sleeve, he threw the teacup off the square table in front of her, splashing tea leaves all over her face. \u201cJust talking about family matters, you make her cry?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t speak the truth, this prince will destroy the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion!\u201d</p><br/><p>He rarely used his identity in front of anyone, and he rarely called himself \u201cthis prince\u201d. Xie Zhen had never heard the words \u201cthis prince\u201d from his speech.</p><br/><p>Perhaps he was so angry today that his words were filled with killing intent. He was like a sharp dagger that could stab into the other party\u2019s heart at any moment.</p><br/><p>With these words, not only was Madam Xu alarmed, but everyone on both sides knelt down, including haughty Madam Wu.</p><br/><p>Madam Wu\u2019s face was deathly pale, and she appeared to be trembling violently.</p><br/><p>She also told tales about Xie Zhen just now, she was afraid she wouldn\u2019t be able to escape today\u2019s calamity\u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen sat in Madam Leng arms, she looked up at Yan Yu\u2019s back and wondered what she was feeling.</p><br/><p>She had pretended to be pitiful when he came in, guessing that they were couple after all, and no matter what, he would definitely help her vent her anger.</p><br/><p>However, she didn\u2019t expect him to be so serious as to help her teach the first aunt a lesson \u2026</p><br/><p>It made her feel a little guilty.</p><br/><p>She lowered her head and silently rubbed her eyes. She didn\u2019t know why, but her eyes felt a little sore.</p><br/><p>Some people could no longer sit still after Yan Yu\u2019s vicious words.</p><br/><p>Madam Wu lowered her head and nervously explained, \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault. I started it first \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu tilted his head and looked at her.</p><br/><p>She continued anxiously, \u201cThe day before yesterday, when Your Highness and Ah Zhen got married, word came out that Your Highness had abandoned Ah Zhen on the night of your wedding \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just concerned about Ah Zhen, so I asked a question.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, she could almost feel the sharpness of his eyes on the top of her head, her body suddenly became soft, and she forced herself to continue speaking, \u201cLater on, eldest sister-in-law took up a few words, perhaps it was because she said it too seriously, that it made Ah Zhen feel aggrieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Madam Xu looked at her in shock.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu looked displeased, \u201cWhat did she say?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Wu continued, \u201cShe said that Your Highness left because you didn\u2019t put your eyes on Ah Zhen \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThird sister-in-Law!\u201d Madam Xu suddenly shouted. She gnashed her teeth and said, \u201cHow can you do such a thing?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDid you not join it?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this time, Madam Wu\u2019s attitude was completely different from before. She became a good aunt who was wholeheartedly venting anger for Xie Zhen, \u201cI only said some words, how is it like you have a harsh tone?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf it weren\u2019t because of you, could Ah Zhen have cried?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Xu family was so angry that as if smoke was rising from her head, but she couldn\u2019t find the words to refute her. After all, she had said those words herself.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s expression was ugly. He clenched his hands into fists at his sides, as if he could attack at any moment.</p><br/><p>The two argued incessantly. Neither of them allowed the other to speak. However, Madam Xu was not as good as Madam Wu on argument, and soon, they were both choked with anger.</p><br/><p>Seeing this, Xie Ying and Xie Yin rushed forward to console their mother. In addition, the people from the fourth branch were also trying to persuade her. All of a sudden, a small room was filled with women\u2019s talking.</p><br/><p>\u201cShut up all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu could not help but rebuke.</p><br/><p>There was a fire burning in his chest, and it almost burned himself out.</p><br/><p>He was annoyed that these people were bullying his Xie Zhen, but also regretting that he was the source of all this.</p><br/><p>If it weren\u2019t because of him, would their wedding night have been filled with such words?</p><br/><p>Then how could Xie Zhen be criticized?</p><br/><p>Even her aunt\u2019s relatives could casually gossip about her. It was hard to imagine what others would talk about her.</p><br/><p>Perhaps the argument in the west wing had alerted the central room, a short while later, and Duke Dingguo and the old lady hurried over to take a look and were stunned by the scene of kneeling inside.</p><br/><p>In the main room, the third and fourth branches were kneeling on the floor, and Xie Zhen was sitting on the lady couch with bloodshot eyes. Beside her were Madam Leng.</p><br/><p>The two old men had an intuition that something serious had happened, and only after asking did they know that it was the two daughters-in-law that caused the trouble with their mouths.</p><br/><p>The old lady knocked on her cane and pointed at Madam Xu: \u201cYou, you two \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how bad Xie Zhen was, she was still a Prince\u2019s wife. How could they talk nonsense in public?</p><br/><p>Moreover, she had returned together with the sixth prince today. According to the rules, she should return and visit them tomorrow. Since the sixth prince was willing to agree to her return today, that meant he was very fond of her.</p><br/><p>And the return gift was well-prepared, giving enough face to Xie Zhen. They can\u2019t even see that, really wasted decades of living.</p><br/><p>Madam Xu and Madam Wu finally stopped talking. Both of them realized that they had said something they shouldn\u2019t have said and felt regret.</p><br/><p>No matter how angry the old madam was, she still had to plead for her two daughters-in-law. She was about to kneel down at the same time, \u201cYour Highness, on account of them being the elders of Xie Zhen, please forgive them this time \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu and Xie Zhen were indeed like a couple. He said the same word that Xie Zhen had said, \u201cDo they take themselves as elders?\u201d</p><br/><p>The old lady and the Duke Dingguo looked at each other, unable to figure out what his intentions were. They joined in pleading, \u201cYour Highness \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He had made up his mind. Today, he would definitely punish these women with their gossipy. Otherwise, who knew what kind of words they would say in the future?</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t matter if they were elders of Xie Zhen or not. Anyone who bullied his wife could not be let go easily. \u201cMadam Xu is discussing the royal family in private. They are disrespectful to the Prince\u2019s wife and they are extremely audacious.\u201d</p><br/><p>His sword-like eyebrows furrowed as he sternly retorted, \u201cMen, bring them down and slap them!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d like to see who dares to be so talkative in the future!\u201d</p><br/><p>As the sound of his voice faded, Wu Ze walked in from the outside with his two guards, carrying Madam Xu with him as he prepared to leave.</p><br/><p>Madam Xu\u2019s face turned pale with fright. She was just a woman. If she were to be smacked by these arrogant guards, would she still be able to survive?</p><br/><p>After struggling to beg for mercy from Yan Yu, seeing that he was not moved, she went to beg for help from Xie Zhen, \u201d Ah Zhen, I\u2019m still your first aunt, don\u2019t tell me that you are willing to\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen put her head in Madam Leng\u2019s arms and pretended not to hear.</p><br/><p>In fact, the corners of her mouth had already curled up. It turned out that there was someone who stood up for her, and she was even happier than if she had stood up for herself.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun sat beside her, thinking she was sad again.</p><br/><p>Just now, when sister was being mocked by the first aunt and the third aunt, she and Madam Leng were anxious on the side, but unable to help.</p><br/><p>At that time, she really hated Yan Yu and thought of him as a big bad guy who mistreated sis. Now, seeing he supported her older sister, she changed her view about Yan Yu, even looked at him with new eyes.</p><br/><p>In the end, she was still a child. Her emotions came and left quickly. She called out, \u201cBrother-in-law.\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, Yan Yu didn\u2019t react and quickly understood that he was being called. He relaxed his emotions and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun pointed at Madam Wu and exposed her. \u201cThird Aunt was just talking about sis. She even said that outsiders were all telling the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Wu\u2019s face paled. Before she could beg for mercy, Yan Yu said coldly: \u201cThen take her down and slap her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her eyes widened in astonishment.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as the guard was about to take her away, Yan Yu said \u201cwait a moment\u201d. Madam Wu thought that there was a way to turn the situation around, and her eyes shone with hope.</p><br/><p>Who would have thought that his next sentence would be, \u201cIf I hear this next time, it won\u2019t be as simple as slapping you.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, the guard led her away.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s imperial bodyguards were all martial practitioners. They were strong enough. With a slap, one of Madam Xu\u2019s teeth was knocked out. Almost half of her face immediately swelled up into a steamed bun.</p><br/><p>When Madam Wu saw this, her legs went limp, and she begged for mercy with tears streaming down her face.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Yan Yu didn\u2019t say anything. No one could save her.</p><br/><p>A good family banquet ended up in a bad mood.</p><br/><p>The Duke Dingguo was also very depressed. He had the cheeks swollen Madam Xu and Madam Wu sent back to courtyard without saying a word. He repeatedly apologized to Yan Yu, \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault for disciplining them badly\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu said, \u201cAs you have disciplined badly, then discipline them properly in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Duke Dingguo agreed, \u201cYes, yes, yes. I will definitely manage my family well.\u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, they hurriedly ate lunch in the main hall. Xie Zhen\u2019s appetite was not good, so only ate a little. No matter how Madam Leng tried to persuade her, it was useless.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu didn\u2019t say anything from beginning to end, but his expression gradually became unsightly. Seeing this, Duke Dingguo was afraid that he would get angry again, so he hurriedly ordered people to prepare almond cheese that Xie Zhen liked to eat.</p><br/><p>When the almond cheese was served, she ate a few more before Yan Yu looked better.</p><br/><p>After lunch, Xie Zhen went back to the Jade Yard to rest with Madam Leng. Yan Yu was not suitable to enter the inner courtyard, so Xie Liqing said to Xie Rong, \u201d Rong\u2019er, why don\u2019t you accompany the sixth prince for a stroll around the estate?\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought that Xie Rong and Yan Yu were about the same age, so they should have some common topics to discuss. It was a pity that he had miscalculated.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong led Yan Yu out. Both of them had a taciturn personality. They walked for more than half of the courtyard, talking to each other without saying many words.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu thought of how Xie Zhen looked like when she cried, his mind was in a mess, and he wasn\u2019t in the mood to try to get close to his brother-in-law.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong was not a person who liked to talk. He had said two sentences: \u201cThis way,\u201d and \u201cThat way.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them finished their tour of the enormous mansion not long later.</p><br/><p>When they were about to return to the central room, Xie Rong finally spoke up. \u201cYou\u2019re not suitable for little lamb.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu stopped and looked at him.</p><br/><p>Actually, Xie Rong\u2019s words are reasonable. Yan Yu and Xie Zhen\u2019s personality were really not appropriate. Both of them are immature, childish, and impulsive.</p><br/><p>Although Yan Yu was much calmer than before, he was still too young to be calm when he was with Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>Moreover, he spoke too much duplicity and was arrogant and wouldn\u2019t easily lower his head.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was also a stubborn one. It was not good for two equally stubborn people to run into each other.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong continued, \u201cAlthough it\u2019s a little late, I want to tell you, don\u2019t let her suffer from the grievances she suffered today. If you can\u2019t do it, return her to the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s gaze turned cold, \u201creturn her to Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could he return his wife to her family after he had married her?</p><br/><p>He strode to the front and threw down the following words: \u201cI know my limits. You don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen follow Madam Leng to the Jade Yard, at first she was a little dejected, but not long after lying in Madam Leng\u2019s arms, she fell asleep.</p><br/><p>She slept in the same way she had when she was a child. She liked to hold the corners of Madam Leng\u2019s clothes, curl up in a ball, and sleep contentedly and sweetly.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng lay on her side, a fan in her hand, gently blowing the wind. It was early autumn and still a little hot in the afternoon, but she did not stop for fear that she would sweat.</p><br/><p>The servant maids wanted to take over, but she wordlessly waved her hands to retreat.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun sat aside and asked worriedly, \u201cMother, do you think their words are true?\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t mean to be nosy. She just wanted to know what exactly Yan Yu had done to Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng lowered her eyes, and pushed away the hair on Xie Zhen\u2019s face. \u201cSo what if it\u2019s true or false?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t you see the sixth prince stand up for your sister today?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAs long as he is good to the Little Lamb, I shall have nothing else to ask of him.\u201d</p><br/><p>As for what the others had said \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if it\u2019s true, there must be something else behind it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun seemed to understand, but didn\u2019t quite understand. \u201cThen, does mother think he likes older sister?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng smiled. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if he likes her, but I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t hate her.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said this, she remembered the time the Lee family moved away when Xie Zhen was seven, and how she cried and said, \u201cBrother Xiao Yu hates me.\u201d Until today, she still seemed to think that Yan Yu hated her.</p><br/><p>She touched Xie Zhen\u2019s forehead lovingly and thoughtfully, this was a silly girl, can\u2019t she see that Yan Yu was protecting her so obviously?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen only slept for less than an hour before she woke up. When she woke up and saw her mother and younger sister by her side, she immediately felt assured. She really wanted to stay and not leave.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, things didn\u2019t go as she had hoped. She still had to leave. It was just that sooner or later.</p><br/><p>Before she left, Madam Leng specially called her aside to ask, \u201cDo you and the sixth prince \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave the consummation?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen put her hands behind her back, she looked around. \u201cNo,\u201d she said.</p><br/><p>The answer was honest and Madam Leng didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><br/><p>She raised her head and asked, \u201cDoes Mother blame me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng shook her head. She wanted to say something, but in the end, she only replied, \u201cAs long as you live well. Let it be.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was overjoyed. Mother didn\u2019t force her, and she felt much more relaxed.</p><br/><p>She still had a lot of things to say, but the people in front had already came to prompt her. The carriage was waiting outside the door, so she couldn\u2019t bear to part with her family, but she had to leave as well.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng and Xie Xun escorted her to the door of Jade Yard. She turned three times in each step until she could no longer see them. Then, she walked briskly to the entrance of Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>At the door stood the Duke Dingguo, Xie Liqing and the others. Yan Yu stood beside the carriage and looked in her direction.</p><br/><p>She said good-bye to her grandfather in turn, then stepped on the footstool and got into the carriage.</p><br/><p>As Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan were about to enter, but they were stopped by Yan Yu. \u201cYou two, sit outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he took down the curtains and walked in.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan had no choice but to sit on the shafts. With a whip in coachman\u2019s hands, the carriage slowly pulled the carriage out.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu sat beside Xie Zhen. He didn\u2019t know what he wanted to say to her alone, so he insisted on sending the servant maids away.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t urge him. The sun was streaming in through the window, throwing dappled shadows at their feet.</p><br/><p>Her face was covered with a layer of gold, perhaps because she was thinking about something. She slightly restrained eyesign, appearing to be in a trance. There was even a hint of a warm smile on her lips.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu opened his mouth in excitement, \u201cYou\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked to him, a smile that hadn\u2019t yet melted in her eyes, which made his wits go haywire.</p><br/><p>His heart beat so hard that he was afraid she would hear him. He moved a little to the other side, afraid to look away. \u201cThe wedding night\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would turn out like this. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s smile disappeared. \u201cSo what do you expect?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had helped her today, and she was grateful.</p><br/><p>However, upon further thought, wasn\u2019t all of this because of him? Thus, after making ends meet, she did not plan to express her gratitude towards him.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s eyes were distant and uncertain, obviously without any confidence, \u201cAnyway, I won\u2019t \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen waited curiously, wondering what he was going to say.</p><br/><p>He held it in for a while. \u201cI won\u2019t leave you alone again.\u201d</p><br/><p>When they were young and in danger, she didn\u2019t even abandon him when they was in danger. Why had he been willing to leave her by himself?</p><br/><p>It was too late to regret it now.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen curled her eyes, and smiled under the sunshine. \u201cHow many times do you want to leave me?\u201d</p><br/><p>For a moment, he thought that there was no longer any misunderstanding between them. Finally, he couldn\u2019t bear it any longer and reached out to hug her. \u201cI \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen retreated, and blinked with innocent eyes. \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>She said that because she was in a good mood and because he behaved well today, but that didn\u2019t mean he could touch her at will.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu stiffened. He withdrew his hand and sat back down, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>After thinking about it for a while, he still couldn\u2019t understand why she only smiled at him once when he helped her vent her anger today.</p><br/><p>Can\u2019t you smile a little more?</p><br/><p>At night, the two of them slept separately.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was in the side room, and he was in the inner room.</p><br/><p>Since the first night when Xie Zhen learned there was no bolt in the side room, she had one installed the next day, so it was impossible for him to enter even if he wanted to.</p><br/><p>When they finished washing seperately in the night, Xie Zhen sat in front of the brass mirror and undid Pearl hairpins. Hong Mei stood behind her, brushing her hair.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu sat under the lamp, reading a book. Occasionally, he would glance at her. What was written on the book, not even a single word could be read.</p><br/><p>She combed her hair and got up to go to the side room. \u201cI\u2019m going to bed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu subconsciously called out to her. She turned around, he couldn\u2019t think of an excuse to leave her stay with him. He stared at the ancient scripture in the book: \u201cThere\u2019s rain tonight, close the window.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was confused. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s cloudy in the evening.\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>She nodded. \u201cI know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then she turned and walked on.</p><br/><p>He added, \u201cThere also is thunder.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time Xie Zhen got to understand, turned and looked at him. \u201cAre you afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>He glared at her. \u201cHow could I be afraid?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was afraid of that she would be afaid, ok?</p><br/><p>Who would have thought that this heartless little bastard actually didn\u2019t understand his intentions. She mysteriously retorted, \u201cThen why are you telling me all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not afraid.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pursed his lips, refusing to admit that he was disappointed.</p><br/><p>Not long after Xie Zhen entered the side room, he put down his scrolls and washed his face and rinsed his mouth and went to bed.</p><br/><p>Oddly enough, he had always slept alone before, and he had never felt anything was wrong. But after he got married with Xie Zhen, he felt odd for sleeping alone.</p><br/><p>He raised his arm to his forehead and looked out at the moon, wondering what Xie Zhen was doing.</p><br/><p>Did she fall asleep?</p><br/><p>In the latter half of the night it began to rain.</p><br/><p>At first the rain was small, but then it began to get heavy, and the heavy rain fell on the eaves and made a noise so intense that one could not sleep.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was awakened by the sound of the rain. The room was dark, and the oil lamp on the table had long since burned out.</p><br/><p>For a moment he could not get used to the darkness, and he lay in bed for a moment, barely able to make out the outline of the inner room.</p><br/><p>He remembered Xie Zhen had light sleep when she was a child, and the slightest sound in the night would wake her.</p><br/><p>One night it rained and thundered, and she did not sleep well all night, and the next morning there was a bruise under her eyes.</p><br/><p>He felt it was funny at the time, but now he cared how she slept.</p><br/><p>Just as Yan Yu was hesitating, he turned his head and saw a figure walking towards him.</p><br/><p>He thought it was Xie Zhen, maybe she was afraid of thunder. He sat up and said, \u201cYou\u2019re wakened?\u201d</p><br/><p>A bolt of lightning flashed outside the window, lighting up the room in a split-second.</p><br/><p>Then he saw her face, and it was not Xie Zhen.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Thinking they were thieves, Gao Xun had come forward to give them a lecture, but he hadn\u2019t expected to see one of the girls decked out so beautifully. When she turned her head, he felt as though the whole household had lit up.</p><br/><p>Her delicate tender cheeks looked just like white pear blossums, clear and bright.</p><br/><p>Suddenly, he thought of those fairies described in those mythological books, were they like her, so beautiful and refined?</p><br/><p>Spellbound, Gao Xun saw little fairy run towards him, full of smiles, looking charming and cute. Thinking that she wanted to speak to him, he nervously coughed and got himself ready. However, contrary to his expectations, she ran past him towards Li Yu at his side, and in her soft and pleasant voice, said, \u201cSo this is where Big Brother Xiao Yu has been, I\u2019ve been looking for you for a long time!\u201d</p><br/><p>Turning his head, Gao Xun saw Li Yu subconsciously taking a step back.</p><br/><p>Li Yu swallowed, and dryly asked, \u201cWhy were you looking for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Young master Li Yu\u2019s mood was not great at the moment. Despite constantly hiding and avoiding her, he was still found by her. Why was this stinky girl so persistent? She was everywhere.</p><br/><p>Speaking of this, Xie Zhen immediately felt depressed, her tone tinged with some exasperation. \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu never comes over to my household, and Aunt Song says you aren\u2019t feeling well, which is why I didn\u2019t go over to disturb you. Last time I sang you a song and you got angry, Shuang Yu said it\u2019s because you don\u2019t like listening to songs. Actually, I can also play the flute, do you like listening to the flute?\u201d</p><br/><p>In actual fact, Li Yu hadn\u2019t been angry because of this. But, upon recalling his pitiful and awkward state, his previously ruddy face turned ashen, and he retorted, \u201cI don\u2019t want to hear.\u201d</p><br/><p>Disappointed, Xie Zhen deflated, and she asked, \u201cWhy do you not want to listen? If you aren\u2019t even interested in hearing that, what on earth do you want to listen to?\u201d</p><br/><p>Previously, she had misunderstood his gender, and had sincerely apologised to him for that, yet he continued to bear a grudge. She also had a temper!</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen pouted in anger, she had been doted on by both her parents since young, and had received much attention because of her outstanding looks, when had she ever been treated this way? Big Brother Xiao Yu really couldn\u2019t tell good from bad.</p><br/><p>Li Yu lied and said, \u201cI don\u2019t like anything\u201d.</p><br/><p>How could one not like anything? Didn\u2019t that mean he had no hobbies at all!</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said in total disbelief, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I teach you how to play the flute? You will definitely enjoy it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Defeated, Li Yu simply shook his head, rejecting her offer. \u201cThere\u2019s no need\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When both of them spoke to each other, everyone else seemed to fade into the background. Gao Xun hung by the side with an embarrassed expression. He had wanted to speak with Xie Zhen, but could never find a good opportunity. If not for Xie Xun coming forward, he would have probably been left standing for a while before Xie Zhen took notice of him.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun tugged on her sleeve, asking, \u201cSis, are we not going to the kitchen anymore?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen then remembered her purpose in coming here, and no longer held up Li Yu, but instead changed the topic asking, \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu, do you know where the kitchen is located?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu didn\u2019t say a word, however beside him Gao Xun asked, \u201cWhy are both of you looking for the kitchen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen finally shifted her gaze on him, tilting her head, with a look of doubt, asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201d</p><br/><p>The little fairy was finally looking at him. Excited, Gao Xun\u2019s heart thumped hard, yet he appeared calm as usual on the outside. \u201cThis is my house, I am Gao Xun\u201d.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen nodded her head and smiled, \u201cI am Ah Zhen\u201d.</p><br/><p>Stupefied, Gao Xun enthusiastically repeated her name a few times. Perhaps it was because he appeared so silly that he attracted a strange look from Li Yu.</p><br/><p>After knowing the cause of the incident, Gao Xun didn\u2019t say anything more, and immediately got the servants to head to the kitchen to get several dishes and desserts to bring to his study.</p><br/><p>He was the eldest son of the Second Madame, and was greatly favoured by the Old Madame, even his study was an independent one. Outside the study was a couch, the floor was covered in a woolen rug, so one could sit on the floor. There were altogether four of them. As the host, Gao Xun naturally would sit at the head, with Li Yu and Xie Zhen at his left and right respectively, with Xie Xun seated besides Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>As a result, it was unavoidable for Xie Zhen and Li Yu to sit facing each other.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xie Zhen wink at him, he immediately turned his head away.</p><br/><p>Most of the dishes on the table were the same as those in the banquet, Xie Xun was full, and this time she remembered Ah niang\u2019s words, and continued to pick out food for Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig sis eat till you are full\u201d.</p><br/><p>As she had just learnt how to use chopsticks, she was unable to hold them steadily most of the time. As a result, food spilled on the table quite a number of times.</p><br/><p>Depressed, Xie Xun said, \u201cWhy do the chopsticks not listen to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen passed her own chopsticks to her, \u201cMy chopsticks are very obedient, use mine.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two sisters really went ahead and exchanged their chopsticks.</p><br/><p>Not knowing whether it was a psychological effect, Xie Xun found the chopsticks much easier to use, and didn\u2019t make any mistakes when she used them to pick food for Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun was stunned, and wondered whether she was really a little fairy who could use magic?</p><br/><p>He and Li Yu hadn\u2019t had lunch, and had originally planned to head to the study to grab some books before returning to eat, but they had unexpectedly chanced upon these two, and so, they all ended up eating together in the study.</p><br/><p>From the very beginning, Xie Zhen had only been about sixty to seventy percent full so after having a few mouthfuls, she put down her chopsticks and said, \u201cI have to bring Ah Xun back, Ah Niang will be worried if she doesn\u2019t see us\u201d.</p><br/><p>After thanking Gao Xun, she held Xie Xun\u2019s hand, ready to head off.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun stood up at once, blushing and with a tinge of reluctance said: \u201d I, I can send both of you back\u2026 Weren\u2019t you both lost earlier?\u201d</p><br/><p>Recalling the earlier scene, Xie Zhen gratefully nodded her head.</p><br/><p>As Gao Xun wanted to see them off, Li Yu obviously could not continue eating alone and could only follow along, walking slowly behind them. However, Xie Zhen had set her sights on him, and occasionally turned back to say a few words to him, causing Gao Xun to feel envious.</p><br/><p>Translator Comments:</p><br/><p>I\u2019m gonna re-watch TLJ tomorrow! Yes I am excited. :))</p><br/><p>We\u2019re in the midst of figuring out a regular fixed schedule so we\u2019ll keep you guys updated!</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">If only that was all. Worse still, Li Yu continuously ignored her.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">In order to attract Xie Zhen\u2019s attention, Gao Xun even resorted to telling the stories the steward had spoken about, and tried his utmost to make Xie Zhen happy. However, as Xie Zhen had come from the capital, there was no story that she had not heard of and so, she quickly got impatient, \u201cAll these stories you are telling me I have heard before, do you have any I have not heard yet?\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Hurt, Gao Xun gritted his teeth and started recounting his antics and embarrassing moments as a child.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">The gist of his recount was that when he had been chased by a big dog for half the street, he was so frightened that he peed in his pants.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\"> Xie Zhen guffawed, and her bright eyes twinkled like crescent moons. Her laugh was pleasant to the ears, crisp and clear.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">After laughing enough, she curiously asked, \u201cHow could you wet your pants when you were already so old?\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Gao Xun rubbed his nose, saying, \u201cI was only four then\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">However, she replied: \u201cThat\u2019s not young anymore, Ah Xun doesn\u2019t even wet her pants now!\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">At the back, upon hearing this, Li Yu\u2019s expression darkened, and it was only with much control that he managed to withhold himself from simply walking away.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Once they returned to the outer courtyard, the banquet had ended and Leng <em>shi</em>and Song <em>shi</em> had remained behind, most likely to wait for their children to return.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Xie Zhen and Xie Xun swarmed towards her, each holding her thigh saying, \u201cAh Niang, we\u2019re back!\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Leng <em>shi</em> sighed in relief, rubbing their heads, raised her head and towards Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan, and asked, \u201cWhere did all of you go? Why did it take so long?\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan then recounted the entire incident of how they had gotten lost, including meeting both Gao Xun and Li Yu along the way, and having a meal together.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">On the other side, Li Yu was already in Song <em>shi\u2019</em>s hands, and upon seeing his ugly expression, asked him what had happened.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\"> Li Yu refused to answer.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Leng shi gave her thanks to Gao Xun, who shook his head, saying, \u201cEveryone who enters is a guest. Since Ah Zhen and Ah Xun came to my household, I must of course take good care of them.\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Leng <em>shi</em> had a good impression of him and couldn\u2019t help but say a few more words to him.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">To be honest, Gao Xun had a very likeable personality, not only was he obedient, but he also had a sweet mouth; furthermore, he was courteous and polite. Even Leng <em>shi</em> was full of praises for him, so it was easy to tell that many elders looked upon him favourably.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">As the crowd dissipated, the majority of the guests left. Xie Liqing had already prepared the carriage at one side, and had ordered some servants to fetch his wife and children.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\"> As both Xie and Li households were situated close to each other, after some discussion, it was decided for both households to return together.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\"> Before leaving, Gao Xun called Li Yu to the side, and both of them spoke in hushed voices. Upon returning, Li Yu\u2019s expression remained the same as he walked towards Song <em>shi</em> and prepared to go up the carriage.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Before he could get on, Song <em>shi</em> quickly asked: \u201cYu er, where are you going?\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Puzzled, Li Yu asked, \u201cIsn\u2019t this our carriage?\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">There was no doubt that it was their carriage, however, Song <em>shi</em> didn\u2019t intend to take their carriage, but rather, went ahead and joined Xie household\u2019s carriage. It was just as well that she wanted to speak to Leng <em>shi</em>, and the carriage was large enough to fit. Unwilling to leave Li Yu alone, Song <em>shi</em> called him to join them.</p><br/><p>Li Yu was alas unwilling to, and pointed to their carriage saying, \u201cAh Niang, go ahead without me, I am alright with sitting in this one.\u201d</p><br/><p>In response, Song <em>shi</em> said, \u201cBut that carriage has been left for the maidservants.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unwilling to give up, he then decided to ride the horse with Li Xiqing. However, his father and Xie Liqing had ridden away long ago. Left with no other option, Li Yu could only sit in the Xie household\u2019s carraige.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Inside the carriage, Xie Zhen and Xie Xun had already taken their seats.</p><br/><p>Both of them were tired; Xie Xun laid within Leng <em>shi\u2019s</em> embrace to sleep while Xie Zhen rested against the sides. It was most likely due to the disturbance that Xie Zhen awoke, she rubbed her eyes and with them half-opened, watched Li Yu, softly saying, \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu\u201d, before going back to sleep.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Throughout the entire journey, she slept the whole way through and didn\u2019t disturb him at all.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\"> Song <em>shi</em> and Leng <em>shi</em> were conversing about what the other madames had been talking about that day, about their children and the numerous events of that day. Li Yu wasn\u2019t interested and so turned his head, catching Xie Zhen soundly asleep.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">She was much cuter when was sleeping as compared to when she was awake.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Gao Xun called her a little fairy, but why didn\u2019t he feel that way at all? Besides having a fairer complexion, and being slightly better-looking than most, she bore no resemblance to a little fairy at all.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">As he looked, Li Yu realised that she was actually quite fair-skinned. He suddenly thought of the green onion tofu dish he had eaten the day before, and wondered if her face was really as tender as that tofu. Unable to restrain himself, he lifted his hand, but halfway, he fiercely put it back down.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Was he insane? What if she woke up?</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\"> Li Yu sighed in relief, luckily he hadn\u2019t been impulsive. Along the way, he occasionally took glances at her face, and before long, they had reached the entrances of their respective households.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Once they had disembarked, Song <em>shi</em> whispered into his ear, \u201d Yu er, why did you keep staring at little lamb?\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">With a straight face, Li Yu replied, saying, \u201cThe carriage was too small, I wasn\u2019t looking at her on purpose.\u201d</p><br/><p>Smiling, Song <em>shi</em> knocked his head, he had obviously been stealing glances at her, but still stubbornly denied it.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Upon reaching the entrance, Xie Zhen woke up, and drowsily followed Leng shi out of the carriage. Once she saw Li Yu opposite her, she immediately sobered up and greeted him with a smile.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Li Yu didn\u2019t respond but Song <em>shi</em> enthusiastically said, \u201cLittle lamb, come by our household in the future to play.\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded her head, \u201cOkay!\u201d</p><br/><p>After that, she followed behind Leng <em>shi</em>, but before even taking two steps, she turned around. Seeing Li Yu was still there, she smiled happily and stuck out her tongue at him cheekily.</p><br/><p>Li Yu\u2019s pulled a face before turning around to leave.</p><br/><p><strong>Translator Comments</strong>:</p><br/><p>To say thanks to our very first donation, we decided to post one bonus chapter today even though we haven\u2019t hit $20!</p><br/><p>Currently, our schedule is such that we only post on Friday and Saturday, but if we have some extra free time during weekdays we\u2019ll translate one more chapter as well!

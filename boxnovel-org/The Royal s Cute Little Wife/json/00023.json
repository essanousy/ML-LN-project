He grabbed her hand tightly. \u201cI\u2019m not done speaking!\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t control his grip, and the pain in her wrist stopped him with a groan. Fortunately, the kite was caught by the maidservants below, so it didn\u2019t break. She felt assured and turned to face Li Yu: \u201cWhat else do you want to say to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The ladder shook a little from the pull, startling the women below, and they held the ladder a little harder.</p><br/><p>The two kids were lying on the top of the wall, surrounded by servants. They were extremely nervous for them, and the two of them didn\u2019t know what they were suffering for. They were still talking to each other as if there was no one around.</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen looked down and saw a red mark on her wrist, her mouth curled up.</p><br/><p>In the sunlight, her skin was like bitty cream, white and tender, almost transparent. Only the piece that Li Yu held in his hands turned red. It was incongruous compared to other places, especially her pitiful expression, which made it seem as if he was bullying her.</p><br/><p>Li Yu hadn\u2019t thought that she would be so weak. He had only lightly gripped her hand, how could he have hurt her?</p><br/><p>He pulled her hand over and rubbed it. \u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cLeave me alone.\u201d She pulled his hand back and tucked her hand under her sleeve.</p><br/><p>She was still angry with him, not sure if it was because he hurt her or because he had left her in the study the last time. Actually, she wasn\u2019t a narrow-minded girl. Normally, she wouldn\u2019t be angry, but once she got angry, it would be extremely difficult to hiss her off.</p><br/><p>Li Yu hadn\u2019t coaxed or apologized to anyone before. Even after several attempts, he still couldn\u2019t say those three words.</p><br/><p>He wouldn\u2019t let her go. She was a little dizzy from the sun.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you trying to tell me?\u201d she asked.</p><br/><p>He was not used to her not bothering him anymore.</p><br/><p>Li Yu said, \u201cMy family has bought a new courtyard outside the city. The scenery there is good, and it is suitable for flying a kite.\u201d</p><br/><p>No response.</p><br/><p>Didn\u2019t she understand what he meant? Why is she so stupid!</p><br/><p>Li Yu was a little angry. He stared at her fiercely: \u201cDidn\u2019t you want to fly a kite? Your courtyard is so small, how can you fly a kite?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\uff1a\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, Li Yu\u2019s face turned even redder when she looked at him. He turned his head, revealing only his red ears. \u201cI can take you there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Was he inviting her?</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy is your face so red?\u201d Xie Zhen revealed his embarassment.</p><br/><p>He raised his arm to cover half of his face, revealing only a pair of sword-shaped eyebrows and a pair of glittering eyes. \u201cAre you going?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was curious, and she couldn\u2019t help taking a few more glances.</p><br/><p>She thought for a moment, then asked seriously, \u201cWill you leave me alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu lowered his arm and said decisively, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about your cousin?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe won\u2019t go.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu had never told Ouyang Yi about this matter. He kept avoiding her these days, so why would he take her to the courtyard to fly a kite?</p><br/><p>Just when Li Yu was waiting for Xie Zhen to agree, Ouyang Yi\u2019s voice suddenly came from behind him, \u201cCousin, who are you talking to?\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned around and frowned.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi was standing a few steps away. She narrowed her eyes and looked at Xie Zhen, who was standing on the other side of the wall. \u201cWhy is it you? What are you talking about with my cousin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stuck out her tongue at her. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she climbed down the ladder and soon she was standing on the ground. Li Yu hadn\u2019t had her answer. He was both anxious and angry at the same time. Why was she so anxious to leave so quickly? Angry that Ouyang Yi had really come at the wrong time, he stuck his head out and looked down at her. \u201cYou haven\u2019t told me if you\u2019re going or not!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen:\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she said that, Xie Rong returned from the outside with nothing in his hands. He probably couldn\u2019t find her kite. He called out to her from afar, and she immediately ran over, \u201cBrother, I found my kite!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu was so angry. He secretly scolded her in the heart. He called out to her: \u201cI\u2019ll come to you on the eighth of next month!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t look back, and he didn\u2019t know if she heard him.</p><br/><p>In the days that followed, Xie Zhen could always see Li Yu on the wall.</p><br/><p>And his reasons were strange. Either the thing had fallen in her yard, or the bird he kept had flown over. It was fine that he was lying on the wall by himself, but he always liked to call her up.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t really like it at first. \u201cWhy do we have to stand in the sun and talk?\u201d</p><br/><p>But Li Yu always had a way of tricking her and then saying something that didn\u2019t make sense. Like what do you like? What do you hate? Why? Why do you hate me?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen answered, and he didn\u2019t seem satisfied. He didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you asking me all this for? I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.</p><br/><p>Her face was as white and transparent as it had been a few days before. A pair of jet black eyes stared at him gloomily. They were young and naive, making others want to bully them.</p><br/><p>Li Yu really wanted to bite her face again. He was so angry that she forgot what she had said and let him think about it all the way until now.</p><br/><p>He lowered his eyes and asked her, \u201cDo you still hate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Because of the low voice and the noise Xie Xun made in the yard, it was hard for Xie Zhen to make out what he was saying. \u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>It was unknown which of his weak points had been stabbed. He suddenly raised his head and aggressively asked, \u201cI wanna know, do you still hate me?\u201d</p><br/><p>It turned out that the words \u201cI hate you\u201d that Xie Zhen said that day had always been engraved in his heart. In this period of time, she wasn\u2019t as friendly towards him as she used to be, and she hadn\u2019t called him brother Xiao Yu. He had always thought that she still hadn\u2019t forgiven him.</p><br/><p>But he hadn\u2019t even apologized to her, how could she forgive him?</p><br/><p>This time, Xie Zhe heard clearly. She had never been questioned so bluntly before. Her pretty face blushed and became a bit uncomfortable. Immediately, a bad idea flashed through her mind. She bit her lip and gave a sly smile. \u201cBad boy.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her appearance was lovely.</p><br/><p>Li Yu\u2019s face darkened, \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t play with me. You\u2019re always criticizing me, and you bullied Ah Xun with someone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu tried to defend himself, \u201cI didn\u2019t bully Xie Xun.\u201d After a pause, he finally found an opportunity to mention the matter of the study. \u201cThat day in the study, it was I \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t say a complete sentence for a moment, so Xie Zhen put her hands to her cheeks and waited with her big, dark eyes open.</p><br/><p>Li Yu watched her eyes, but he was even more speechless.</p><br/><p>\u201cI \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>He turned his head, and said seriously, \u201cWhatever, don\u2019t hate me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought he was going to say something. She had been waiting for a long time, puffed up her cheeks and purposefully said, \u201cI hate you, I just hate you. Hate!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu was truly angered, \u201cNo, don\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>She grunted. \u201cNone of your business!\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she ignored him and climbed down the ladder. She successfully landed in nannie Chen\u2019s arms, made a face at him, turned her head, and ran off.</p><br/><p>Li Yu almost crawled over from the wall to catch her, but just as he was about to take action, Ouyang Yi discovered him.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi, who was standing below, asked with dissatisfaction, \u201cCousin, why are you climbing the wall again? I\u2019m going to tell uncle and aunt!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu had no choice but to stop halfway and look unwillingly in the direction where Xie Zhen was running. He thought that if he caught her next time, he would make her take back what she said today.</p><ul><li></li></ul><br/><p>Recently, it had been raining continuously for quite a few times, as if there was no end to it.</p><br/><p>After the rain stopped, it was already the sixth day of the new year. During the last few days, Xie Zhen stayed inside the house and didn\u2019t go out. She didn\u2019t even see Li Yu on the wall in the backyard. Today, it is a good day, the sun is shining brightly, there were no clouds, Xie Zhen is going to the backyard to see Xie Rong fishing. She was wearing a white silk blouse and a flowery skirt with a pair of embroidered shoes with gold piping. As she was walking past a wall, a voice suddenly came from the top of the wall: \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at 9:00 at your door the day after tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked up and saw Li Yu staring at her.</p><br/><p>She patted her chest, \u201cBrother Xiao Yu, you scared me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu\u2019s expression eased up slightly as he said with a taut face, \u201cThen it\u2019s settled.\u201d After that, he descended from the top of the wall and disappeared in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen touched her head. She didn\u2019t know when she had made a agreement with him.</p><br/><p>At night, she specially ran over to the Leng\u2019s room to talk about it, but didn\u2019t expect the Leng to reject her. \u201cIf it\u2019s just the two of you, you can\u2019t go.\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, she and Li Yu had ran into two accidents when they were together out, so she had no choice but to accept this.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen coaxed and pestered Madam Leng, but She never allowed it.</p><br/><p>The next day, Madam Song made a special trip. They said that the place was very safe. There were more than ten servants inside and outside, and the yard was clean. Only then did Madam Leng reluctantly agree.</p><br/><p>However, Madam Leng still did not feel at ease. After all, she had learned her lesson, so she arranged seven or eight maids and women for Xie Zhen to accompany her.</p><br/><p>On the eighth day, the sky was clear and it was suitable for travelling.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said she hated Li Yu, but she was looking forward to flying a kite with him.</p><br/><p>She had cleaned everything up and waited, but Li Yu never came to pick her up.</p><br/><p>She thought he had some business to do, but instead she waited until it was dark.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

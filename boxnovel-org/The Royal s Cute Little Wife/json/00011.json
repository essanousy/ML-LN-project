However, they were all scattered by the crowd. They found everywhere but still could not find Xie Zhen and Li Yu. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Xie Rong looked anxious. His serious face didn\u2019t show any expression. He told Stewart Wang to go to yamen and inform Xie Liqing that he was still looking for them. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">They just lost a child. Steward Wang said nothing and refused to leave him, either to go back or to stay together. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Gao Xun came forward and said, \u201cYou guys go back. I\u2019ll bring people to find Ah Zhen and Ah Yu.\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">The ice knife in Xie Long\u2019s eyes came crashing down on him, making his teeth chattered. He knew that everything was his fault. If he hadn\u2019t insisted on taking Xie Zhen out, there would have been no such incident. He was also very regretful. He was also worried about Xie Zhen and Li Yu, so he tried his best. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Finally, Gao Xun and Steward Wang didn\u2019t leave. It was a servant who went to yamen and informed Xie Liqing. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">After learning of this, Xie Liqing rushed over, looking anxious. He didn\u2019t bother to teach the child a lesson and led the group to search nearby. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">What they did not know was that Xie Zhen and Li Yu had gone in the opposite direction. They had searched for an afternoon and an evening. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">It would be dark now, and there might be more danger if he didn\u2019t come back. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Xie Liqing was in a bad mood and didn\u2019t dare tell her wife, Madam Leng. However, in the end, Madam Leng was still able to hide it from her. Most of the information she heard from the servants had nearly passed over her. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">What if her precious Little Lamb had lost her, so small and tender? </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Xie Zhen had been a bit more delicate than she was. She remembered that she was only four when she was in the Duck Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, and she had been sick for most of the month by Third Sister Xie Ying in the winter. The girl\u2019s body was strong and she didn\u2019t have anything to do with playing with snow. Only her body was the most honest, and if she met a bit of dissatisfaction, she had to show it. If she was cold, she would become ill and her pinch would turn blue. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">She couldn\u2019t curse her, but only cherished her in her hands. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Now that their charming daughter had been lost in the street, the more she thought about it, the more desperate she became. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Xie Liqing didn\u2019t know what was going on in his home, and he was still discussing with the others about finding people in Yamen. At this time, they had no choice but to prepare for the worst. If they were abducted, they would search for the teeth of everyone in the Azure Province, and they had to find two children. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Li Xiqing and Gao Qing arrived upon hearing the news. Gao Qing dragged his son to apologize to the two of them. Xie Liqing and Li Xiqingg spoke politely, but they were all extremely worried. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">In the twilight zone, as the evening approached, yamen was in a mess, knowing that the Prefect\u2019s daughter was lost. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">The sky gradually darkened, and the red sunset glow lingered in the distance. After struggling for a while, it sank. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">How can two children stay out for the night? They didn\u2019t know. The light in Xie Liqing\u2019s eyes and Li Xiqing\u2019s eyes gradually faded, revealing a thick sense of exhaustion and helplessness. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Suddenly, the bailiff came in and said, \u201cSir, there are two children at the door. I wonder if it\u2019s \u2026\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Before he could finish his words, Xie Liqing walked out like the wind. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Li Xiqing hurriedly followed after hearing what he said. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Four lanterns hung in the doorway, and in the dim light two small figures were reflected. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Li Yu staggered over with Xie Zhen on her back. He was weak, almost dragging Xie Zhen. Xie Zhen was lying on his back, talking nonsense. She was clearly unconscious, but she still stubbornly clutched at his back clothes and pressed against him. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Xie Liqing walked up to him and grabbed Xie Zhen from his back. He cried out in joy, \u201cLittle lamb, father\u2019s good Lamb!\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">He didn\u2019t hold back. He was so shocked that her body was boiling hot, like a fireball, and she was still shivering. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Li Xiqing came over to Li Yu and looked him up and down. He hugged him tightly and mumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s good that you\u2019re okay, it\u2019s okay.\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">He was so tired that he could barely talk in his arms. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">He lifted his eyes and saw Xie Liqing holding on to Xie Zhen anxiously. He rubbed her forehead for a moment and then squeezed her palm. \u201cLittle lamb, what\u2019s wrong with you? However, his worries rose to the limit in the blink of an eye. He turned his head and ordered, \u201cQuickly go and bring a doctor!\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Li Yu sighed heavily, then said, \u201cShe\u2019s got a fever.\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">As they walked along the road, Xie Zhen kept saying that she couldn\u2019t walk anymore and wanted to rest. Li Yu thought that she was acting coquettishly, so he ignored her words. Who knew that she would actually fall down to the side of the road without saying a word, and that made Li Yu be scared. He knew that she was in a fever, so he carried her to the door. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">If it wasn\u2019t for the good people he met on the way, he wouldn\u2019t have come here. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Xie Liqing thanked Li Yu several times and even Xie Rong, who was silent, said thank you. He felt a bit embarrassed \u2026 He hadn\u2019t been so good to her, and he\u2019d hurt her a few times on the way. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Thinking up to this point, Li Yu looked at Xie Zhen, who was hugged by Xie Liqing and caught the carriage. Her eyes were closed, her small face flushed, her beautiful brows knitted together, and she seemed to be in a bad mood. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">\u201cYu\u2019er, what are you looking at?\u201d Li Xiqing told the people to bring the carriage over to bring him home. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Song was probably in a rush at home. Fortunately, the child was fine and came back safely. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Li Yu withdrew her gaze and followed him to the carriage. \u201cI didn\u2019t look at anything.\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Sitting in the carriage, he was probably very tired. He lay on the bed and didn\u2019t even want to move. His hands and feet were both soft and sour. That stinking girl is so heavy, he thought, he\u2019ll never carry her back again. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">After a moment\u2019s thought, he closed his eyes and asked, \u201cWhy is she feverish, Abba?\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Li Xiqing was in a much more relaxed mood when she recovered her son. He asked, \u201cWhich her?\u201d Then, he reacted, \u201cDid you say about Ah Zhen? She\u2019s young and frightened, and the fever is cold today.\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">\u201cBut I don\u2019t have a fever,\u201d he said. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Li Xiqing rubbed his head with a smile as he earnestly explained, \u201cAh Zhen is a girl, and the girl is already more delicate than a boy. She can\u2019t be compared to her.\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">He asked, \u201cWhat is the pampered?\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Li Xiqing thought for a while. This question was really not easy to answer, \u201cIt\u2019s just natural weakness \u2026\u201d He needed the protection of a man. He was afraid of being hungry, but he was afraid of being hungry. Same as the newborn. \u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Li Yu thought about it seriously and said, \u201cWhat animal? A lamb? \u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">The child normally didn\u2019t say anything, but he remembered the nickname of Xie Zhen. Li Xiqing laughed loudly and nodded, \u201cRight, right, you\u2019re just a lamb.\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">He rolled over and curled his lip in disgust. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">He was afraid of being hungry\u2026 Wasn\u2019t that she? He had seen newborn lambs, but not as delicate as she. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">When he returned to Xie Mansion, Xie Liqing hurriedly carried Xie Zhen back to his room and asked the doctor to come forward to diagnose her. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Madam Leng, who has been at home several times, has finally made people look forward to coming back. But I didn\u2019t expect my daughter to be so hot. She stood at the head of the bed and snuggled into Xie Liqing\u2019s arms, crying, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t let her go out with you \u2026\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s only been half a day, and that\u2019s it\u2026\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">\u201cIt\u2019s my fault, it\u2019s my fault,\u201d she said. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">After a short while, the doctor\u2019s diagnosis and treatment was completed. When he stood up, he said, \u201cI was shocked. My pulse was unstable. My daughter\u2019s fever is caused by the shock. I have a prescription here, and the old master ordered someone to follow me back to grab the medicine. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Xie Liqing hastily thanked the doctor for the payment and sent a man over to grab the pills. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">It was late in the day, and after Madam Leng had taken her medicine, she calmed down. During that time, she was unconscious, and from time to time, she said, \u201cHelp me,\u201d Madam Leng\u2019s heart was crushed into a ball. She stayed by her bed all night, not daring to leave. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">It was dawn, and the morning light was showing, and Madam Leng felt a deep sigh of relief as she touched the forehead of Xie Zhen. It was a good thing, but it wasn\u2019t hot. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Shuang Yu served up with the juice, and Madam Leng fed it to her. Just as she was halfway through her meal, she frowned and woke up. Her first sentence was actually, \u201cKill \u2026\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">It was only a day before her ruddy little face was drained of color. She bent down to form the shape of a small shrimp, her long eyelashes lowered tiredly, covering the pitch-black eyes of her. After a long while, she finally realized where she was. She turned her eyeballs in confusion and saw the regretful Madam Leng on the bed. She blinked her eyes and thought that it was an illusion. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Madam Leng nodded hurriedly. Anywhere uncomfortable? \u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">She\u2019s really her mother! </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">She ran into Madam Leng\u2019s arms in surprise and held her neck without letting go. \u201cMother, mother, am I back? Is this my house? \u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Madam Leng said yes and held her in her arms for a while. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">At first she was glad, and then she thought of the grievances she had suffered on the street, and that her clothes were wet at the neckline of the Madame Leng\u2019s neck. She whimpered and began to complain, \u201cOur carriage is broken, and we have met bad guys.\u201d Little Brother Xiao Yu bought me preserves and mountain medicine cakes. I bought a hairpin for you, but later on, someone wanted to catch me, and little brother Xiao Yu threw him into the box. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">She was incoherent, but Madam Leng understood. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">\u201cIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay, as long as we\u2019re fine.\u201d Madam Leng thought that if a hairpin could change her daughter\u2019s return, she would rather not wear jade jewelry in her life, and she would make Xie Zhen safe. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">After cooling Xie Zhen, Madam Leng continued feeding her the rest of the half-bowl. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">The medicine was bitter, but she didn\u2019t say anything this time. She didn\u2019t even eat a drop. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">At last, Madam Leng rewarded her with a piece of preserves and smiled. \u201cI\u2019ll let Ah Xun come in with you later, and she came over to argue last night, and I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t allow it.\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Xie Zhen had recovered from a serious illness and was not in a very good mood. Xie Xun came in and said a few words to her. She mimicked Madame Leng\u2019s head and said, \u201cSister, I\u2019m sorry \u2026\u201d </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">She had learned from Xie Rong that she had only come to the streets to buy a hairpin. If it hadn\u2019t been for her, she wouldn\u2019t have lost her fever at all. She wouldn\u2019t have lost her. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Even the servants of Xie Mansion could tell that Xie Zhen was very obedient these few days. He ran to Xie Zhen\u2019s room every day to help his errand boys work. But she was a child, a third girl. Who dared to command her? </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">She was basically fussy. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">After a few days, Xie Zhe finally recovered and returned to his usual vivacious appearance. The Xie Manor once again heard the two sisters\u2019 laughter and laughter. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">Winter passed in the blink of an eye. After the end of the year, it would be the </span><span class=\"ql-size-12 ql-author-10154349\">The Lantern Festival</span><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">, and it would be filled with lights. </span></p><p class=\"ql-long-10154349\"><span class=\"ql-author-10154349\">There were also guests from the capital.</span></p><br/>\n</div>"}

They were shocked by the situation outside that Ouyang Yi was out of breath from crying. She actually dared to grab onto the sixth prince\u2019s sleeve. No wonder the sixth prince\u2019s expression was so bad.</p><br/><p>They were busy taking care of Madam Li inside, so they didn\u2019t pay attention to what happened outside. They didn\u2019t expect there would be such a mess in the blink of an eye.</p><br/><p>The two of them hurriedly stepped forward to hold Ouyang Yi. Ouyang Yi looked thin and weak, but she was strong. The two of them spent a long time before finally pulling her away.</p><br/><p>Xiang Lan raised her eyes, but even didn\u2019t have the time to heave a sigh of relief before she saw the person behind the tree. Her heart skipped a beat. She pulled Liu Lan and bowed. \u201cEmpress.\u201d</p><br/><p>A single word raised a thousand ripples.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stepped out from behind the tree, with her hands behind her back, and her dark eyes caught Yan Yu\u2019s sight, and she moved her eyes away before he could speak.</p><br/><p>She looked at Ouyang Yi and pursed her lips into a smile. \u201cI originally wanted to wait for you to finish crying before coming out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Yan Yu immediately got panicked. Did that mean she had been standing there for a long time?</p><br/><p>Then why didn\u2019t she just come out?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu opened his mouth to speak, but Ouyang Yi, who was standing at the side, forgot to cry when she heard the servant maids called to her. She stared at Yan Yu in disbelief.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi had never thought that Yan Yu would marry so early. To be precise, she had never thought that Yan Yu would marry.</p><br/><p>He treated everyone with a aloof and indifferent attitude. Ouyang Yi simply couldn\u2019t imagine what he would look like when he married, nor what kind of girl he would marry.</p><br/><p>Now that she saw it, she couldn\u2019t help but want to probe deeper.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi looked at Xie Zhen and had to admit that she was very beautiful. She had a beautiful face and bright eyes and white teeth. She was like a beauty that walked out of a painting, and every part of her was perfectly delicate.</p><br/><p>However, when she watched closely, she found this face somewhat familiar. It was as if there was a face like this in the depths of her memories, as well as such a smile.</p><br/><p>For a moment she couldn\u2019t remember who she was, or perhaps she was thinking of something, but she didn\u2019t want to think deeper.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stood a few feet away. She tiled her head, trying to have a check about what was going on in the room, and then asked Ouyang Yi. \u201cIs your mother in there?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi nodded. Her eyes were red from crying. \u201cYou, you\u2019re the Prince\u2019s wife?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said \u201cYeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi\u2019s words were more perfunctory, but since the Prince\u2019s wife didn\u2019t want to make a fuss about it, Liu Lan and Xiang Lan naturally didn\u2019t dare to say anything.</p><br/><p>However, seeing that she was not moving at all, Xiang Lan could not help but tug on her clothes, quietly reminding her, \u201cMiss, you must bow when you see the empress.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi did a quick double take. She looked at Xie Zhen and hesitated for a moment before slowly bowing.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m a distant cousin of the sixth prince,\u201d she explained, lowering her head.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen I was young, I stayed at his house for a period of time before separating for some reason \u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen smiled. \u201cYeah, I know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi stopped and raised her head, puzzled. Just as she was about to ask how she knew, Yan Yu finally could not restrain himself and asked, \u201cWhen did you come over?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, Ouyang Yi was crying in front of him, so he didn\u2019t notice her at all.</p><br/><p>Actually, she hadn\u2019t been there for long. When the servant maids discovered her, she had just walked over to the tree.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu paused, \u201cAren\u2019t you unwell?\u201d</p><br/><p>Perhaps because he was afraid that she would misunderstand, his expression was a little nervous., and his tone was a little anxious, so he appeared unfriendly.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was silent for a long time, then looked at him. \u201cYou don\u2019t want me to come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu glared and quickly retorted, \u201cWhen did I say that?\u201d</p><br/><p>She said softly, \u201cWell, you must think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was annoyed and called her name helplessly: \u201cXie Zhen!\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s what he always called her when he\u2019d been pissed off by her.</p><br/><p>After the two words, there was a long silence.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as she stared at Xie Zhen. She stared at her again and again.</p><br/><p>She had never thought that, after so many years, Yan Yu would marry Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>Was it the Xie Zhen?</p><br/><p>Was it really the beautiful and nasty Xie Zhen, who was as sly as a little fox?</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t believe that her cousin would marry her.</p><br/><p>Her cousin was the sixth prince, so what was her identity?</p><br/><p>Her father was only a prefect of Qing Zhou, how could she have the qualifications to be a Prince\u2019s wife?</p><br/><p>It was fine to not know that the Prince\u2019s wife was Xie Zhen, and she could convince herself to accept it wholeheartedly. Once she found out that this person was Xie Zhen, her attitude changed\u2026</p><br/><p>Remembering how she had bowed to her a moment ago, she felt so regretful that her intestines turned green.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said, \u201cYou\u2019re yelling at me again.\u201d</p><br/><p>He immediately gave up, and even weakened his momentum. With a twist of his head, he insisted, \u201cI didn\u2019t think so.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi could not help but interrupt their conversation as she asked with a skeptical tone, \u201cYou \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you really Xie Zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not answer her. Instead she asked, \u201cDo you want I am or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was stumped by the question and could not answer it for a long time.</p><br/><p>But it was clear in her heart that this person was no doubt Xie Zhen, the person she hated the most when she was young and the person she was jealous of the most.</p><br/><p>She had an outstanding appearance and a happy family, and now she was a Prince\u2019s wife.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi didn\u2019t know why. They were clearly separated back then, so why were they still together after so many years?</p><br/><p>Was it because of this that she had always kept pestering her cousin before, that she had become a prince\u2019s wife?</p><br/><p>Once she had such a thought, she would never be able to forget it.</p><br/><p>On the way back to the main courtyard.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen kept a short distance in front, with Yan Yu behind her.</p><br/><p>In order to keep up with her pace, Yan Yu had to take one step at a time in order not to overtake her.</p><br/><p>He called out to her. \u201cXie Zhen.\u201d</p><br/><p>She did not hear him, but kept walking.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu took two quick steps and walked behind her. \u201cWhat did you see?\u201d</p><br/><p>She still didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>When she got back to the Zhanyue Court, she went into her room and ignored him.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu didn\u2019t know what was going on. She was clearly fine just now, and she still talked to him at Pavilion Changqing. Why did she ignore him when she left the courtyard?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu followed closely into the room. As soon as he was about to entered, he was blocked by two servant maids.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Highness \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe Empress is not feeling well, please leave.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to check how she was feeling, but after asking around for a long time, he found out that she was changing the menstruation stripe \u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s face was as hot as burning. He stand outside, seemingly at a loss as to what to do.</p><br/><p>After waiting for her to finish, he barged in regardless of everything and asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you talk to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had pain of lower abdomen, so she was not happy. She glared at him.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was confused. He automatically sat beside her. \u201cAre you angry?\u201d</p><br/><p>She moved aside, without looking at him. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu continued to move close to her, \u201cThen why don\u2019t I talk to me?\u201d</p><br/><p>She lower her eyes. \u201cPain of lower abdomen. I don\u2019t want to talk.\u201d</p><br/><p>She might been lying, because her face was full of displeasure.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu seemed to be enlightened. He looked down her line of sight and landed on his own sleeve. In a split-second, he stood up, took off his outer robe and threw it to the side, standing in front of her, \u201cCan you talk to me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was stunned, and shaked her head.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t say why, so he had to study it himself and explain slowly from the beginning: \u201cAunt fainted outside the door, that\u2019s why I brought them into the house.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhen she recovers, I\u2019ll take them out of the house.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a pause, he continued to explain, \u201cCousin did not hold my hand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen finally said, \u201cYou want to hold hands with her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu glared at her and threw her on the Arhat Bed. His whole body covered over her, and he spoke into her left ear. \u201cI don\u2019t like to hold hands with others.\u201d</p><br/><p>After the end of the talk, his left hand touched to the side and grabbed her hand, holding it firmly.</p><br/><p>Madam Li and Ouyang Yi stayed in the sixth prince\u2019s estate for seven or eight days. Every day, the servant maids brought them food and medicine, serving them carefully.</p><br/><p>They had suffered too much outside, so they were moved and frightened when they suddenly settled in such a comfortable place. But as days went on, they got used to it and were reluctant to leave.</p><br/><p>Madam Li\u2019s health had improved slightly after several days of treatment. She occasionally got out of bed and walked around the courtyard.</p><br/><p>She was used to busying herself a few years ago, so now that she was free, she was not used to it.</p><br/><p>One day she went to the well to fetch water and washed her and Ouyang Yi\u2019s clothes.</p><br/><p>When Ouyang Yi saw this, she immediately helped her up and scolded her, \u201cMother!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you doing this for?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDidn\u2019t the doctor ask you not touch cold water? What month is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe water is so cold, can your body bear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Li told her to lower her voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be so surprised about? Didn\u2019t you need to do it before?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was both angry and anxious, and her voice could not help but increase in volume. \u201cIt\u2019s different now. We\u2019ve found my cousin!\u201d</p><br/><p>She thought that as long as they got into a relationship with Yan Yu, he would not abandon them. No matter what, they would not live the same life as before.</p><br/><p>Madam Li brought her back to her room, complaining that her voice was loud, afraid that her words would be heard by others.</p><br/><p>She had been like this ever since she was young. She was always blabbering and not likeable.</p><br/><p>Even after so many years, nothing had changed.</p><br/><p>Madam Li asked her, \u201cHave you asked Yu\u2019er? Did he tell you anything?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi shook her head in disappointment. \u201cCousin did not say anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had been here twice in the last few days, Yan Yu came here more often, but totally, there were no more than four of five times.</p><br/><p>Every time he was here, he just checked Madame Li\u2019s health.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi took the opportunity to ask him some questions, such as why he had changed his identity, why he had not been with the uncle and aunt, and why he had married Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>But he said nothing, and he would not answer her, no matter how she asked.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi did not give up and decided to go to Xie Zhen and get more information from her.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

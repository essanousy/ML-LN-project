Even the men of ordinary officials would have to avoid it, let alone the relatives of the emperor. Wasn\u2019t it inappropriate for the princess to ask the prince to come back now?</p><br/><p>The midwife\u2019s face showed hesitation, but just as she was about to persuade her, \u201cPrincess, don\u2019t be worried \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before she finished speaking, Shuang Yu turned and walked out, \u201cI will send someone to the crown prince\u2019s mansion!\u201d</p><br/><p>Before the midwife could stop him, she was gone.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu had her own plans in mind, so she definitely did not act on impulse. Looking at how much importance Yan Yu had placed on Xie Zhen in the past few days, he would definitely be watching over at the side if Xie Zhen was giving birth to a baby. On the contrary, if they didn\u2019t tell him just because it was unlucky, he would probably be angry.</p><br/><p>That was why she immediately informed a servant to head to the crown prince\u2019s mansion and told An Wang that the princess was about to give birth to a baby.</p><br/><p>The servant dragged a horse and rushed to the crown prince\u2019s mansion.</p><br/><p>At that time, Yan Yu was still in Yan Tao\u2019s study, the two of them took up their respective rooms, separated by a jade bead curtain, and in front of them was a teacup with the Water Immortal pattern on it. Unfortunately, ever since Yan Yu sat on this armchair, he had not even tasted the tea.</p><br/><p>He slightly lowered his head, his bony fingers holding onto the palisander\u2019s cloud patterned armrest, and his thumb slowly moved along the pattern on the armrest, not saying a word, as if he was thinking about something.</p><br/><p>He did not speak, and Yan Tao stayed silent in the study room.</p><br/><p>The two of them remained silent for a long time. Finally, Yan Tao slowly flipped open a book with a slight smile on his lips as he looked towards Yan Yu: \u201cSixth brother, have you considered it carefully?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he put down the book, crossed his hands, and leaned on the table, looking like he was quietly waiting for a good song.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s eyelashes slightly trembled, but she did not raise her head, and was unwilling to look at him the entire time. Her voice was cold and aloof, as if she did not hold any emotion in it: \u201cIt has been a long time since Second Brother had such a thought, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>The words was like a stone into a calm lake, causing ripples.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao smiled noncommittally, feeling that this little brother was intelligent and did not hide anything. \u201cIndeed, this idea has been in my mind for a long time, but I have never said it out loud.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Tao was afraid of him, and he started to be afraid of him even before he became the emperor.</p><br/><p>When he thought about it carefully, he realized that it was not that extraordinary. Yan Yu had performed too well in the Lanling Country, and she had defeated the Western Yi army time and time again. Yan Tao had not even ascended the throne, but there were already rumors saying that he was more suitable for the throne.</p><br/><p>Therefore, the Crown Prince invited him to his house and discussed the conditions with him.</p><br/><p>This condition was very tempting. When Yan Tao promised to be able to ascend to the throne in the future, he gave Yan Yu a few rich and prosperous towns in the southeast, and gave him the title of Prince. He could personally govern a few towns, and the officials in the cities could disobey the emperor\u2019s orders and directly take Yan Yu\u2019s orders. In other words, among these towns, his position was equivalent to the emperor.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s lips curled up into a mocking smile, because he was facing the Crown Prince, Yan Tao did not notice.</p><br/><p>His status was the same as the Emperor\u2019s \u2026 Yan Yu tapped the armrest, he could not tell that second brother had spent so much effort to deal with him.</p><br/><p>If he were to go to the feudal fiefdom, he would naturally have the military power to bring him to it. At that time, if he wasn\u2019t in the capital, wouldn\u2019t they be able to say whatever they want? With two hundred thousand soldiers in his hands, he would be able to hold onto his own weight. Any random rebellion would have been enough to turn him into a sinner from ancient times, ending up just like the First Prince.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu muttered to himself for a moment, and asked unexpectedly: \u201cAre you afraid of me, Second Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Tao was slightly startled, and even his usual gentle smile stiffened at the corner of his mouth.</p><br/><p>\u201cSecond Brother, are you worried that I\u2019ll steal your seat?\u201d He asked again, calmly, calmly, as if he were talking not about a matter of national importance, but about ordinary weather. He waited for a moment, but did not hear a response from Yan Tao. He raised his head and looked into the room, his almond-shaped eyes were cold, as though he was smiling, \u201cSecond brother, do not worry, everyone has their own aspirations, my ambitions are different from second brother\u2019s. Since I have helped you to such an extent, I will not change my mind midway and fight over your position. When the father abdicates, you take control and I will be my idle prince. If there is an invasion from another race at the border, I will go forth and kill the enemy. If the world is at peace, I will stay at home and take care of my wife and children.</p><br/><p>Their conversation was not suitable for others to hear, so the two of them had long left the servant outside the study room, leaving behind only the two of them.</p><br/><p>Speaking of which, it was already very obvious. If Yan Tao was still worried, then it would not make sense.</p><br/><p>He could only temporarily suppress his worry and stand up, saying, \u201cWith Sixth Brother\u2019s words, I will be relieved.\u201d</p><br/><p>After all, the Emperor Yuan Hui had not abdicated his position, he was still the crown prince. If today\u2019s conversation were to spread, it would be disadvantageous for both of them. However, he was in a rush, Yan Yu\u2019s contribution was like a thorn in his heart, as long as it was not pulled out, he would not be able to sleep at ease.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not answer and stood up with him.</p><br/><p>After leaving for half a day, it was time to go home.</p><br/><p>Before he could say his goodbyes, a shadow flashed outside the window, then a servant dressed in green came to the door of the study, looking a little anxious, \u201cYour Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Tao opened the bead curtain and walked out of the room, calling him to stand up: \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant stood up and replied Yan Yu: \u201cReporting to Your Highness, someone from the An Wang\u2019s Mansion has arrived. I heard that the princess is about to give birth! \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu trembled, and stared at him fiercely. \u201cWho said that?\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant then answered honestly, \u201cI am following the orders of a servant maids called Shuang Yu \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>His expression turned cold, and he no longer asked any more questions. He started walking towards the door.</p><br/><p>Wind blew under his feet as he moved extremely quickly.</p><br/><p>When they arrived at the front yard, they saw the An Wang\u2019s Mansion people waiting there, and they spoke about the same thing. Yan Yu did not expect him to be here for so long, and that Xie Zhen would birth him soon, so he did not dare delay, and did not even bother to inform Yan Tao before leaving the crown prince\u2019s mansion and riding on his horse, galloping back to An Wang\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao followed him out of the residence, and looked at his back. After a while, she instructed: \u201cGo, prepare a horse for me too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The attendant was slightly taken aback. \u201cWhere is the hall\u2019s exit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Tao stood with his hands behind his back, and smiled slightly, \u201cThe the sisth sister-in-law is about to give birth, if I do not go, I would not be able to see.\u201d</p><br/><p>However\u2026 Not so good? It\u2019s not like he was his wife.</p><br/><p>Although the servant was puzzled, he did not give Yan Tao any face.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao took the reins and got on it. With a \u201cJia\u201d sound, he left.</p><br/><p>An Wang\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>A rider and a rider rushed to the door and stopped steadily before the two lions. Before the gatekeeper servant could clearly see who it was, he saw the other party throw down the horsewhip and enter the manor like a gust of wind.</p><br/><p>Looking at that horse, isn\u2019t it the Prince\u2019s mount, the Azure Sea Steed?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu walked straight towards the Zhanyue Court, and just as he arrived at the courtyard entrance, he heard heart wrenching screams coming from inside.</p><br/><p>His heart tightened as he quickened his pace to enter the cave.</p><br/><p>servant maids went in and out of the main room, boiling pots after pots of hot water. As he could not let Yan Yu see some of it, he drank from the servant maids, and asked her what was in her hands. servant maids lifted the towel s that were lying on the ground and saw that the water in the basin had been dyed red with blood.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu staggered, he was finally able to stabilize himself, and he rushed towards the inner room.</p><br/><p>The servant maids did not dare to stop him, and they all retreated to the side.</p><br/><p>The doors and windows of the inner room were tightly closed. It was the end of spring, and there was a dry and hot feeling on his face.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s voice came from the inside, she had already cried out without much strength, from her crying at the start to her crying now, it was as though a cat was scratching at the tip of his heart, \u201cI\u2019m in pain \u2026 It hurts \u2026\u201d She raised her hands to grab the midwife beside the bed. Her palm-sized face was drenched in sweat, and her bright eyes were filled with hope. \u201cBig brother Xiao Yu still hasn\u2019t come back yet? \u201cI\u2019m about to die here\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>There were two midwives in the room, one wrestling with her legs at the end of the bed and the other cheering her on at the head of the bed.</p><br/><p>The one at the head of the bed, while listening to her nonsense, wiped the sweat off her forehead with a handkerchief. \u201cPrincess, don\u2019t think about this anymore. His highness\u2019s status is honorable, he cannot come in to see me. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was obviously in a daze from the pain. She only felt that she didn\u2019t have any strength left, and could faint at any moment. \u201cWhy. I won\u2019t be able to give birth anymore \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When the midwife heard this, she immediately panicked. If this baby lost its strength, that would be incredible! She quickly encouraged Xie Zhen by reminding him to think about the little prince in his stomach, \u201cThe baby haven\u2019t seen his parents yet \u2026 Princess, please work harder and let him come out \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>What a crap! Xie Zhen thought in her heart, she had already gritted her teeth many times.</p><br/><p>Just as she was in a daze, the midwife cried out \u201cYour Highness\u201d. She raised her head and saw that Yan Yu was standing beside the bed.</p><br/><p>The midwife quickly said, \u201cWhy did you come in \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she was about to chase him out.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not budge, he just sat on top of the plate and held Xie Zhen\u2019s cold hand, \u201cLittle Lamb, I\u2019m back.\u201d</p><br/><p>The girl on the bed was pale and drenched with sweat. When had he ever seen her in such pain? He felt as if his heart was twisted into a ball, and it was extremely painful for him.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was a little wronged as tears the size of beans flowed out from the corner of her eyes and fell onto the pillow. She complained weakly, \u201cWhat took you so long? I\u2019m going to die from the pain. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu could not help but clench her hand, and say \u201cI\u2019m sorry\u201d endlessly.</p><br/><p>Seeing that it was no longer possible to drag it out like this, the midwife did not chase Yan Yu out, but instead allowed him to stand to the side to prevent it from getting in her way. The two midwives took turns to cheer Xie Zhen on, letting her work harder, even more so.</p><br/><p>\u201cSoon, Princess, you will succeed soon!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen felt that she was about to be torn apart, she had never felt such pain before. She wanted to never give birth to a child ever again \u2026 Yan Yu even said that he wanted to give birth to a nest, in his dreams! He should be born himself!</p><br/><p>Because Xie Zhen\u2019s pelvis was small, and it was also her first birth, so it was born with great difficulty. Xie Zhen cried on the bed, biting so hard that she was bleeding on her lips. When Yan Yu heard this, he felt like his heart was about to break, he couldn\u2019t do anything else, he couldn\u2019t help her share of the pain, and could only watch from the sidelines anxiously. In the end, he brought his own palm to her mouth for her to bite on, and used his other hand to stroke her forehead, \u201cAh Zhen, Ah Zhen \u2026 No more, we will never be born again \u2026. \u201cJust this one \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He was truly afraid. He could only watch helplessly as the bedding beneath his bed was completely stained with her blood. With such a small body, how could he have lost so much blood?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen opened his mouth and bit on Yue Yang\u2019s hand without hesitation.</p><br/><p>Perhaps it was the effect of his words, or perhaps it was time, but at the end of the day, a clear cry came from inside the room. Xie Zhen felt her body lighten, and just as she was about to pant, she heard her midwife say: \u201cOne more, one more!\u201d</p><br/><p>What other one?</p><br/><p>Her lower abdomen hurt again. Only now did her did a quick double take increase, there was still another in her lower abdomen!</p><br/><p>This time, Xie Zhen was really crying.</p><br/><p>Two hours later, when the second child fell out, she was exhausted and didn\u2019t even have the strength to speak.</p><br/><p>At dawn, she fell into a deep sleep before she even had time to look at the child.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu got someone to change into a clean bed and blanket, and personally wring the handkerchief to wipe the sweat off her face. Her eyes were focused, as if she was the only one in sight.</p><br/><p>The midwife walked over while carrying the baby, and said with a smile, \u201cCongratulations, Your Highness. You are the twins of mixed sex, the first one to be born is the Crown Prince. Take a look \u2026 \u201cHow exquisite \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu said as he turned his head, \u201cCarry him away.\u201d</p><br/><p>The midwife was stunned. She thought she had heard wrongly.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

She knew that there were a lot of her family members, and that both her older sister and her husband had come today. Moreover, her mother was afraid of these furry little animals. She thought for a while, and secretly went back to her room and let servant maids make a temporary nest for Ah Duan with a blanket, and then she carefully put it inside</p><br/><p>The doctor that Yu Qing invited still hadn\u2019t arrived. She wiped away her tears, looking at Ah Duanas she sobbed softly.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t die\u2026 \u201cIf you don\u2019t die, I\u2019ll let you go when you recover from your illness.\u201d She spoke to the rabbit in a tone of consultation, and the little creature crouched on the ground, gently toying with its ears.</p><br/><p>But Ah Duan did not move. It still looked listless.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the doctor finally arrived. However, he was only treating people, and not good at dealing with animals. He sat down and looked around. Under Xie Xun\u2019s nervous gaze, he slowly asked, \u201cWhat did Seventh Miss feed it a few days ago?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun blinked her eyes, \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah Duan had always been fed by Zhong Shang, so she often went over to take a look. She would occasionally feed it some vegetables and leaves, and to ask him what it had been feeding it \u2026 She really didn\u2019t know.</p><br/><p>The doctor replied: \u201cIf I\u2019m right, then it\u2019s probably because it ate too much a few days ago, causing the food to precipitate and become indigestible in my stomach, that\u2019s why its appetite doesn\u2019t rise anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, he rubbed Ah Duan\u2019s stomach. Indeed, there was a bulging area.</p><br/><p>The doctor felt relieved, and went to the side to write down the prescription. \u201cI will prescribe a few herbs, and the young lady will let the servant mash them into juice and pour it into its water, letting it drink with me to see if it is effective.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun nodded his head. After the doctor finishes writing the prescription, she would have Yu Qing pay the consultation fee to the doctor.</p><br/><p>The servant brought the medicine back, and after Xie Xun mashed it into the juice, she personally watched Ah Duan drink. Ah Duan was simply too weak, and even looked listless while drinking the water. Xie Xun looked at it, and suddenly remembered the scene of Zhong Shang bullying her at the door. She puffed out her cheeks and folded her arms, \u201cBig Brother Zhong Shang is such a bad guy \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she finished speaking, a clear and loud voice came out from behind: \u201cAh Xun, when did you come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>She hastily turned her head. Xie Zhen, wearing a blue jumpsuit with Du Ruwen as her head was pierced by a golden hairpin that was embedded with clouds, and like a clear spring, she crashed into her line of sight without any forewarning. \u201csis. \u201d After shouting, she suddenly felt a little guilty and moved to the side, trying to cover the rabbit behind her.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xie Zhen still saw it. She walked in her direction, \u201cWhat are you hiding behind?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun shook her head like a rattle, \u201cNothing at all!\u201d</p><br/><p>Nonsense, her face clearly said, \u201cI\u2019m hiding something, don\u2019t come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>If one were to say that Xie Zhen was a liar, then Xie Xun would be the one who would never lie. So Xie Zhen only made an \u201coh\u201d sound, and took the chance to circle behind her when she was caught off guard. She stared at the rabbit who was lazily lying on the blanket in the cluster of flowers, her face full of astonishment. \u201cHow come the rabbit?\u201d</p><br/><p>She would not be able to hide it now\u2026</p><br/><p>She guiltily lowered her head and looked left and right: \u201cUn \u2026Big Sister Zhong Rou gave it to me. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen obviously did not believe her. Did Zhong Rou look like someone who knew how to raise rabbits? There had to be more to it. Thus, she rolled her eyes and turned around to leave. \u201cIf you\u2019re not telling the truth, I\u2019ll go and tell Mother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun hurriedly pulled on her sleeves, begging her anxiously and pitifully, \u201csis, don\u2019t go, please don\u2019t tell Mother \u2026 I said, I said. \u201d</p><br/><p>Thus, she told the story of how she saved a rabbit on the day Mingqiu Lake kited and gave it to Zhong Shang to raise. After Xie Zhen heard this, she fell silent for a moment, then asked a irrelevant question: \u201cDo you and Zhong Shang see each other often?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun nodded her head and answered sincerely: \u201cWhen I want to see Ah Duan, I will go to his courtyard with Big Sister Zhong Rou.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she noticed that Xie Zhen\u2019s face did not look good and nervously asked: \u201csis?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen waved away all the servant maids s in the room, and the Five Breaking Light embroidered pier sitting opposite of him spoke with a serious tone: \u201cAh Xun, don\u2019t get too close to Young Master Zhong.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Xie Xun was angry at her, that was her reason. Now that Xie Zhen said it, she was still a little confused: \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen muttered to himself, \u201c\u2026 \u201cNow that you\u2019re fourteen, and about to get married, you can\u2019t always hang out with other men. This is bad for your reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>In fact, she wanted to say that Zhong Shang had a bad reputation, it would be better to avoid contact with him. However, she was worried that Ah Xun would be embarrassed if she spoke too directly, so she changed to a more tactful way of speaking.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s former reputation as a loose man was still there. Although he had restrained himself a lot after joining the army, who knew what his private thoughts were? Giving Xie Xun to him, Xie Zhen really couldn\u2019t be at ease. Her little sister was like Bai Jasmine in the courtyard, clean and white, like Zhong Shang who was a very shrewd and cynical young master, who didn\u2019t suit her at all.</p><br/><p>Who knew what kind of idea he had towards Ah Xun. Ah Xun was different from him, but he could not bear the damage.</p><br/><p>Therefore, Xie Zhen would definitely not allow this to happen.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun obediently nodded his head, \u201cI will be less in contact with Big Brother Zhong Shang in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anyway, they had a fight. she thought guiltily.</p><br/><p>Seeing her like that, Xie Zhen heaved a sigh of relief, rubbed her head and looked at the rabbit on the ground, \u201cAfter it is done, what do you plan to do with it?\u201d</p><br/><p>On the way back, Xie Xun thought of something, \u201cI will hide it in my room for the next few days. When Ah Duan\u2019s sickness recovers in a few days, I will send him away or return him back to the Mingqiu Lake\u2019s woods. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen agreed to take her to the front courtyard to have lunch with everyone.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>That night, Zhong Shang drank at a restaurant very late, drinking one cup after another. In the end, he simply couldn\u2019t wait and allowed the waiter to pour the ancient wine from the altar into his mouth. He drank very grandly, the wine sliding down his smooth chin to his neck, wetting his clothes on his chest, and sticking to his chest, revealing his muscular chest.</p><br/><p>He drank the whole jar in one gulp, then threw it on the floor. The wine jar shattered with a crack, and pieces of porcelain scattered across the floor.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Zhong Shang bullied me, I won\u2019t forgive you!\u201d</p><br/><p>A voice from the angrily sounded beside his ear.</p><br/><p>Then one after another, all of them were the same voice. Some were timid, some were soft, and some were sweet.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother knows that I will get angry if I drink alcohol \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cDoes big brother Zhong Shang want to raise it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBig brother Zhong Shang is so good!\u201d</p><br/><p>His head was aching, and his head was filled with her voice. If she said he was fine, he thought, then why was he so angry today?</p><br/><p>Wasn\u2019t it just a rabbit?</p><br/><p>After thinking for a long time, Zhang Xuan still couldn\u2019t come up with an answer. Instead, his head hurt even more. He stood up to pay the bill and walked slowly back to the general\u2019s mansion. It was already dark, the moon was melting in the sky, and the evening wind blew through the inner square, but it did not dispel the frustration in his heart. He walked back to the general\u2019s mansion, where the servant s all greeted him and served him. He walked back to the house in a bored manner, without even bothering to clean himself, he fell asleep on his bed.</p><br/><p>When he woke up the next day, he felt much better.</p><br/><p>He changed out of yesterday\u2019s clothes, showered and changed his clothes. After washing his face and rinsing his mouth, he first made a trip to the army camp. When she came back, she was already at the end of the line. She initially wanted to go to Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion to apologize to little miss Xie, but then she thought that her anger should still be lingering.</p><br/><p>It dragged on for three days. He thought that she should calm down and let the servant send a message in Zhong Rou\u2019s name inviting her to meet him at the Full Moon Restaurant in the city.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang waited inside the building for 4 hours, but Xie Xun did not come.</p><br/><p>He asked the servant if he had delivered the letter, and the servant promised repeatedly that she had received it personally by Xie Xun\u2019s side.</p><br/><p>Since she had already delivered it, why didn\u2019t she come?</p><br/><p>There was only one answer. She didn\u2019t want to see him.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang waited for another hour, and watched as the sun set and the sky darken. There were less and less people on the main street of capital, and he was still the only one left on the top floor of the Full Moon Tower. His mood gradually sunk and his expression became as calm as water. In the end, he finished the cup of tea in one gulp, stood up and said to servant, \u201cLet\u2019s go home.\u201d</p><br/><p>They did not meet again for the next half month.</p><br/><p>As Ah Duan\u2019s sickness gradually recovered, Xie Xun handed him over to Lu mama who was in the house. Lu mama had a seven-year-old granddaughter who was meticulously thinking of raising small animals, so giving it to her was just the right choice. After sending Ah Duan away, Xie Xun told servant maids to open the door wide and clean all the traces Ah Duan left behind, so as to prevent Mother from getting a rash after entering.</p><br/><p>Although the letters were delivered in the name of Big Sister Zhong Rou, Zhong Rou would never invite her to a place like the Full Moon Restaurant, so with one look, one could tell that it was Zhong Shang\u2019s idea. However, she had just promised sis that she would not interact with Zhong Shang too much and that she would not go back on her words.</p><br/><p>On the afternoon of the next day, Xie Xun learned how to make dumplings from nanny Lu. After cooking them, she planned to send them to Madam Leng and Xie Liqing. Just as she was about to push the door open and enter, the voice of the Madam Leng came out. \u201cAh Xun is still young, isn\u2019t it too early to say all this?\u201d</p><br/><p>Something to do with her?</p><br/><p>She stopped and instinctively did not knock on the door. Instead, she gestured to the servant maids behind her to keep quiet, hiding under the window to eavesdrop.</p><br/><p>As if he was in a good mood, Xie Liqing smiled and said, \u201cLet\u2019s settle the engagement first, there\u2019s no need to worry about it in the future \u2026 Ah Xun is still a child right now, if we were to arrange a marriage ceremony for her, perhaps she might grow up a little. \u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng did not say anything. It was unknown if she was moved.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing then continued: \u201cI have observed before, the young master of the Grand Secretariat Gu family has yet to get married. He is a knowledgeable and handsome man, so he is very a good match to Ah Xun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng slowly said: \u201cAre you talking about Gu Yi, who was kicked out of high school at the age of eighteen?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cExactly.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long while, Madam Leng slowly said: \u201cShe is indeed a good candidate \u2026 However, if you need to ask Ah Xun for her opinion, she is still young, so there is no need for her to be so anxious. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing smiled as she agreed.</p><br/><p>The topic of conversation inside gradually changed to another direction, but Xie Xun stood outside in a daze.</p><br/><p>Father, Mother, you want to propose marriage for me?</p><br/><p>She panicked and didn\u2019t know what to do. When she looked up and saw several pairs of eyes looking at her, she felt embarrassed and suddenly blushed. She passed the dumplings to Senior Servant Lu, \u201cSenior Servant, help me deliver it in \u2026\u201d I, I still have things to do, so I\u2019ll head back first. \u201d</p><br/><p>Nanny Lu tactfully didn\u2019t ask any further questions.</p><br/><p>She turned and ran silently.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

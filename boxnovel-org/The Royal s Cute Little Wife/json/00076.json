The road was too fast for the horse to move as soon as it reached the entrance. Yan Yu didn\u2019t have the time to care about it. He handed the reins to the servants and walked towards the Yu Tang Court like a gust of wind. It was already late at night, and the sky was dark. When the servants heard of the Sixth Prince\u2019s arrival, they hurriedly went to report to the Duke of Dingguo. Yan Yu came to the Yu Tang Court and asked the maidservants who were sweeping the yard, \u201cIs Xie Zhen back?\u201d The maidservant was shocked and replied hesitantly, \u201cShe, she\u2019s back \u2026 Fifth Miss \u2026\u201d Before he could finish listening, he headed straight for the living room. It just happened that Madam Leng came out of the house and wasn\u2019t surprised to see him. He opened his mouth and called out to his mother-in-law, feeling inexplicably nervous. \u201cI\u2019m looking for Xie Zhen.\u201d Madam Leng did not move aside. Instead, she smiled and said, \u201cThe little Lamb has fallen asleep inside.\u201d He subconsciously looked into the room, but unfortunately, everything was blocked by the screen, so he couldn\u2019t see anything. Madam Leng knew that he was anxious, but still wanted to say to him: \u201cLet her sleep a little more. Come with me to the side room, I will have a word with you.\u201d Perhaps it was because he had known her since he was a child, and because she was Xie Zhen\u2019s mother, he had always respected her. Though he was anxious to see her, he still followed her to the side room. As he left, he kept looking back, as if he was afraid that she would wake up. The side room had a low table, the floor was covered with a picture, Madam Leng and Yan Yu sat on either side of the room. The room was warm. When the maidservant brought the tea, Yan Yu came with a stomach full of cold air. Only then did he feel thirsty. He picked up a cup of the tea and drink it in one gulp. Madam Leng waited for him to finish before waving away the maidservants in the room. She said, \u201cThese words are a little disrespectful. If Your Highness is unhappy to hear them, then tell me. I won\u2019t say any more.\u201d Yan Yu retracted his gaze, \u201cPlease speak.\u201d Madam Leng thought for a moment, then said with a smile, \u201cAlthough you are the Sixth Prince now, in my heart, you are still that awkward Yu\u2019er of the past.\u201d She didn\u2019t know why he\u2019d changed his identity, but she\u2019d taken him for a junior, and that was why she\u2019d invited him to sit here and talk openly. Not wanting to quench his thirst, Yan Yu poured himself another cup of tea. \u201cDo you know why the Lamb came back today?\u201d He stopped and looked away, saying, \u201cIt was my thoughtlessness that caused her to suffer.\u201d Knowing what you was wrong in, you wasn\u2019t that stupid. Madam Leng smiled. She was not a person who liked to beat around the bush, so she went straight to the point. \u201cThen tell me, do you have feelings for my little Lamb?\u201d He had just taken a sip of water and was choking it all down his throat. When he finally stopped, he pretended to wipe his face with his sleeve. He blocked his red cheeks and nodded. If not, why rush back to her? Although he had already said it in front of Xie Zhen, it was still a bit difficult for him to confess in front of his elders. Hearing him say that, Madam Leng felt relieved instead. She handed him a handkerchief to wipe his face. \u201cI know you\u2019re not good at expressing yourself \u2026When you were a child, you were pestered by a little Lamb. You must have been annoyed by her.\u201d He said no, wiped his face, and said sheepishly, \u201cNo trouble.\u201d It really wasn\u2019t easy for him to confess \u2026 Madam Leng giggled, her face full of love. \u201cWhen the little kid was young, she really liked you. I\u2019ve never seen her so persistent towards anyone. At that time, she often said that she wanted to find big brother Xiao Yu and even forgot about Rong\u2019er. For this reason, Rong\u2019er has never treated you well.\u201d Yan Yu pursed his lips, \u201c\u2026I know.\u201d She thought of something and thought about it. \u201cWhen you left that year, she was sad for a long time. When we visited the Li family, the courtyard was already empty. When the Lamb met your cousin in the yard, they had a fight in the yard, and when she came back she cried even harder. Do you know why she cried? \u2018 Yan Yu was a little taken aback. He did not know that there was such a thing. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cOuyang Yi said that you moved away because you hated Lambs.\u201d She smiled and added, \u201cYou still hate her the most.\u201d Yan Yu finally understood why she had asked him to \u201cwheater hate her or not\u201d. It turned out that Ouyang Yi had lied to her in this manner when he didn\u2019t know. He hurriedly explained, \u201cI don\u2019t \u2026\u201d \u201cYou left without a word,\u201d interrupted Madam Leng, \u201cand she suffered such a blow. Master and I are afraid that she will not be able to recover. Fortunately, Gao Xun came to stay with her every day, so she slowly recovered.\u201d Yan Yu remained silent. \u201cLater, when I returned to the capital, you became the esteemed Sixth Prince. She was probably afraid of you, so she was muddledly married back to you. Perhaps it\u2019s because of this that she\u2019s wary of you. She can\u2019t get warm at all.\u201d Yan Yu let out a slow grunt of agreement after being stabbed in the chest. Leng smiled. \u201cYou two are both dishonest. If you could be more honest \u2026 I\u2019m afraid it will be much better than now.\u201d Seeing that Yan Yu didn\u2019t say anything, she tilted her head and looked at the sky outside. It was already late, and Xie Zhen was probably about to wake up. She stood up and said, \u201cThe Lamb is the best person to coax. You can talk to her a bit more. Be more considerate with her and her anger will dissipate.\u201d Finally, she walked out of the side room. Yan Yu didn\u2019t leave. He sat in the room for a while longer, thinking about what Madam Leng had said to him. It was like he was enlightened, and everything became clear. When Yan Yu came into the room, Xie Zhen had just woken up and was sitting on the bed talking to Xie Xun. Her smile was beautiful, her cheeks dimpled, and she smiled sweetly. He suddenly realized that she hadn\u2019t smiled at him like that in the past few days. If only he had discovered it long ago. If he had discovered that she was unhappy and didn\u2019t like Ouyang Yi, he wouldn\u2019t have made her suffer all these grievances alone. The sisters sat on Arhat Bed, one on either side of the other, because Xie Zhen\u2019s left foot hurts, Xie Xun put a small pillow under her foot and let her step on it. Xie Xun held her hands together, and for a moment, she pondered, carefully stringing up the ropes on either side of her to form the shape of an arch bridge. She smiled. \u201cAh Xun, you\u2019re so stupid,\u201d she said. \u201cI taught you last time.\u201d Before she could finish her words, she looked up and saw Yan Yu standing outside the door. The smile stopped on her face, and she slowly withdrew it. Xie Xun turned around and called out in a crisp voice, \u201cBrother-in-law.\u201d Yan Yu stepped forward and stopped in front of the two of them. Because Xie Xun was there, he acted rather restrained. His gaze fell on her stockinged feet before returning to her face. \u201cYou \u2026\u201d After a long time, clumsily asked, \u201cDoes your foot hurt?\u201d \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d It was fine if she didn\u2019t ask, but when she did, he was so angry that his expression turned ugly. \u201cYou\u2019re back, how can I not come? You actually \u2026\u201d When he turned his head and saw that Xie Xun had not left, he swallowed the latter part of his sentence. \u201cWhat did I do?\u201d Many things were inconvenient to say, in the presence of Xie Xun. Fortunately, Madam Leng arrived in time to make an excuse for the snow to call Xie Xun away. Before she left, Xie Xun was still a bit reluctant to apart with her. \u201cI want to play ropes with sister \u2026\u201d Madam Leng tapped her forehead and said, \u201cLittle fool.\u201d What\u2019s more, she couldn\u2019t hear any more of it, because Madam Leng and Xie Xun were already far away. Yan Yu sat on a rosewood embroidery stool at the side, placing her feet on his leg. \u201cDoes it still hurt?\u201d She ignored him and put the rope away. Who would have thought that Yan Yu would take off her socks without warning to check her wounds. He held her feet in his hands, and if she hadn\u2019t been sprained, she would have kicked him. However, she was afraid of the pain and didn\u2019t even dare to move. \u201cLet me go!\u201d Her small, fair, delicate feet moved uneasily like jade lotuses, and he pressed his thumb against the center of her foot, carefully inspecting her swollen ankles. \u201cI heard something happened on the carriage?\u201d He pressed his slightly rough thumb against the soles of her feet, her eyes were red enough and she almost laugh. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to care!\u201d However, he did not let her go. Lowering his eyes, he asked, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to care, then who do you want to care? Gao Xun?\u201d She gritted her teeth. \u201cLet me go!\u201d If this carried on, the little Lamb would really get angry and would no longer pay attention to him. He stopped and put her socks back on, but he couldn\u2019t resist the jealousy in his heart. She sat on Arhat Bed and he looked up at her. \u201cHe saved you?\u201d Her eyes were red. She rubbed her head and turned away from him. He said pitifully, \u201cLamb\u2026\u201d She still doesn\u2019t look at him. He sat forward and took her hand on the bed. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d \u201cNothing.\u201d He didn\u2019t believe, Gao Xun got along with her, and it was during the time when he and she were arguing \u2026 He wanted to ask, but he didn\u2019t dare to. Madam Leng had asked him to be honest. For her sake, he didn\u2019t mind keeping a straight face. He slowly parted her hands and clasped her fingers. \u201cAre you unhappy these days?\u201d She said no, but her face said \u201cYes, I\u2019m not happy.\u201d She tried to free her hand from his, but he held tight. He said, \u201d I don\u2019t know. If I knew you didn\u2019t like Ouyang Yi, I wouldn\u2019t have let her live here.\u201d She looked at him. His throat tightened, and he met her eyes with an involuntary tension: \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d For the first time in his life, he apologized to someone. He was not skilled at it, but for her, everything was worth it. \u201cBut you already let her live in here.\u201d He said, \u201d I\u2019ll put her out so you won\u2019t see her. \u201d She said no more. He asked anxiously, \u201cDo you forgive me?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d He stood up, his emotions unawares. \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cGet out of here,\u201d she said, pointing to the door. \u201cGet out of here.\u201d After a moment of realization, regret appeared on his face. He stood on the spot, unwilling to leave. He quickly explained, \u201cI did not give her clothes, nor did I give her a hairpin. She was prepared by the steward and has nothing to do with me. If she marries another day, that will be her dowry. \u201d The two of them talked for a long time in the room, until the sky was completely dark. This was the Madam Leng\u2019s room, and the Madam Leng had been sitting in the side room with Xie Xun to make room for them. It was getting late, so Madam Leng asked the maid to clean up the room where Xie Zhen used to live and let the two of them stay there temporarily. It should be biddy to carry Xie Zhen on back, but Yan Yu said he didn\u2019t want to, so he carried her on back by himself. He carried her back to the room as the porch lights were dim and Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan lit lanterns in front of them. Yan Yu explained to her for a long time, but he did not know if she heard him. After a long pause, he asked her, \u201cWill you come back with me tomorrow?\u201d \u201cNot good.\u201d He lifted her up, helpless against her, afraid to speak aloud. \u201cWhy, are you still angry?\u201d She said, \u201cYeah.\u201d Carrying her on his back, he felt more at ease than he had ever felt before. He only felt that this stretch of road was not long enough. The bright moon hung high in the sky, shining on the two of them. It created a long shadow as they slowly walked forward. As she approached the room, he called out to her, \u201cXie Zhen\u201d She didn\u2019t reply. He called again: \u201cLamb?\u201d \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He said, \u201cI don\u2019t hate you.\u201d \u201c\u2026 I like you.\u201d The moon was misty and his face could not be seen clearly. If they could see him, they would notice that his face was even redder than the sunset. \u201cDon\u2019t get angry, okay?\u201d She rubbed his shoulder. \u201cNot good.\u201d He said it so late that she would not forgive him easily.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

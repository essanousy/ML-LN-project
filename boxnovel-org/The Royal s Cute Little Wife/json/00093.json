Instead, he changed into a set of black clothes behind the walls of the nearby provincial governor Lin\u2019s Mansion, put on his prepared clothes, and walked out calmly and unperturbed.</p><br/><p>The sky had turned white, and the first rays of dawn were beginning to show themselves.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun came to the two sides of the street and ordered a bowl of noodle soup and a pancake. He sat down at the corner with a calm expression and started eating.</p><br/><p>He watched the street as he ate.</p><br/><p>The street was bustling as usual. There were hawkers on both sides of the street. People were coming and going, and it was bustling with noise and excitement. There seemed to be many guards on this street, checking door to door. When the citizens asked them what was going on, they told them that the Lord Ping\u2019s mansion was robbed at night, and a precious treasure was stolen. The Ping Wang ordered them to capture this thief and punish him severely.</p><br/><p>Very quickly, they arrived in front of Gao Xun\u2019s stall.</p><br/><p>The guard looked around and, seeing no one suspicious, left.</p><br/><p>In fact, when Gao Xun fought against Yan Yun yesterday, he had actually cut open Gao Xun\u2019s chest with his personal dagger, but Yan Yun himself probably did not notice, which was why he missed out on this clue. Gao Xun was glad that he covered his face last night. In addition to the darkness and the dark clouds blocking the moonlight, he couldn\u2019t see his facial features. Finding him in the capital was like looking for a needle in a haystack.</p><br/><p>Yan Yun\u2019s dagger was extremely sharp. One slash cut into his chest and left a small wound.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun only used some cloth to bandage it quickly, not enough time to treat it. He decided to apply the medicine after he returned to the army camp.</p><br/><p>He finished a bowl of noodle soup and wiped his mouth with his sleeve.</p><br/><p>He suddenly felt dizzy.</p><br/><p>He paused for a moment, ignoring the fact that he had to keep walking.</p><br/><p>After walking for some distance, he saw a clinic in front of him. He pushed open the door and entered, preparing to pack some medicine to treat his external injuries. However, because his feet were unsteady, he bumped into the person who came out.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou \u2014 \u2014\u201d The other party was a girl wearing a Sky Blue Embroidery Shirt with tender green circumference, the chiffon dress s. They frowned in dissatisfaction as they complained and raised their head to glare at him.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t look at her and lower his eyes apologized, continuing to walk inside.</p><br/><p>Lin Huapin pursed his lips in dissatisfaction and said unlucky thing, he did not care about it at all.</p><br/><p>She was here to get medicine for her father. Recently, his heart had been on fire and he was coughing violently. She was worried that he would fall ill at this rate. Thus, she decided to come to the hospital to get medicine. He didn\u2019t expect to meet a blind man \u2026 She snorted and sat in her carriage. She couldn\u2019t help but think of that person\u2019s appearance.</p><br/><p>He was pretty good-looking, but he was too rude.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun naturally did not know of Lin Huapin\u2019s evaluation of him, he grabbed some medicine from the doctor and returned to the army camp.</p><br/><p>Him not returning all night was a violation of the military\u2019s rules, but he was a Chiliarch, and had Zhong Shang and General Zhong protecting him, so naturally no one said anything.</p><br/><p>Furthermore, he was sweating profusely when he returned. Other people would think that he had secretly gone out to train and admire him.</p><br/><p>Returning to the tent, he took off his jacket, revealing his bare chest. He saw that the wound on his chest had turned purplish black. The blood had soaked the bandaged cloth and had not stopped.</p><br/><p>The dagger was poisonous!</p><br/><p>He gritted his teeth. The First Prince was really shrewd, even his dagger could be poisoned. It could be seen that he was prepared to fight with others at any time. He did not even trust the people around him.</p><br/><p>He told the soldiers standing guard outside that no one was allowed to come in without permission, and then began to bind his wounds with difficulty.</p><br/><p>His top priority right now was to get rid of the poison, but he didn\u2019t know what kind of poison it was, and there was no cure for him in the barracks. He could only stop the bleeding first. He was currently sprinkling medicine on his wounds, and the tent flap was lifted by someone from the outside. Zhong Shang walked in with large strides: \u201cWhere did you go yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>With his back to the door, he said hoarsely, \u201cGet out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang sensed that something was wrong with his voice and didn\u2019t go out. Instead, he went over to look around.</p><br/><p>This time, he was shocked. Zhong Shang stared at his injured chest and asked: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</p><br/><p>He answered lightly, \u201cPoisoned.\u201d</p><br/><p>Isn\u2019t this nonsense? Only a blind person wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that he had been poisoned!</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang sat opposite of him, but didn\u2019t try to help him out. He carefully looked at his wounds, they were not shallow, and also had poison in them. He revealed a rare serious look, \u201cHow did you get injured? What poison did you get? Even though the poison has yet to be cleared, you intend to treat it this way? \u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun told him to go to the side and get a white muslin cloth, and wrapped it around him quickly to stop the bleeding, \u201cI still don\u2019t know what poison it is, I\u2019ll go to the street and let the doctor have a look.\u201d</p><br/><p>He wasn\u2019t worried at all!</p><br/><p>If the poison was slightly stronger, he would have been killed before he could reach the infirmary. Zhong Shang suddenly stood up, pointed at him and said: \u201cSit here and don\u2019t move, I\u2019ll get someone to get a doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun called out to me before I had even taken two steps, \u201cDon\u2019t make any noise, tell the world that I\u2019ve only caught a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Gao Xun didn\u2019t know what was going on, he respected his opinion.</p><br/><p>Not long after, the doctor came over and studied his chest carefully. He said that this was a poison of the Western Yi, and the poison was not considered strong, but it was more troublesome to cure, and required several types of medicine to be consumed continuously for a month before it could be completely removed. He could not use martial arts during this period of time. He needed a light diet to slowly recuperate.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang told the doctor to prescribe the medicine and the doctor wrote a prescription for him. Zhong Shang then asked a trusted soldier to follow him and catch the medicine.</p><br/><p>Only Zhong Shang and Gao Xun were left in the tent. Zhong Shang crossed his arms and looked at him calmly: \u201cWhere did you bring this poison from?\u201d</p><br/><p>But he didn\u2019t say anything, and just laid down on the bed, \u201cI\u2019m tired, so I want to sleep for a while. You can go out first. \u201cThis month, just say that my body is not well and I won\u2019t be able to train with you guys.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang really wanted to kick his face.</p><br/><p>On account of the fact that he didn\u2019t argue with him, he would interrogate him when he woke up. Zhong Shang opened his tent and walked out. Gao Xun lay on his bed for a long time without sleeping, turning things over and over in his mind. He had a lot of things to do, one of them was Xie Zhen\u2019s smiling face, one of them was Xie Zhen\u2019s figure crying in the wilderness, the other was the scene of him fighting against Yan Yun last night. Just as he was about to fall asleep, the tent was suddenly lifted from the outside, bringing with it a scorching summer breeze.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang ran over to him and picked him up from the bed. He looked into his eyes and asked: \u201cYou went to assassinate the King?\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes were unperturbed as he calmly asked, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence was equivalent to tacit agreement.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang did not care whether he was injured, and threw him back onto the bed, then angrily grinned, \u201cWho doesn\u2019t know that the Ping Wang is wantonly searching for assassins in the city?\u201d</p><br/><p>He closed his eyes.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang walked around the bed twice, recovering from the initial shock. He turned his head and looked at Gao Xun, \u201cIt\u2019s really you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was quite magnanimous, and there was no longer a need to conceal anything. \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t return last night, and was even injured on his body. The timing was so coincidental that it was strange, so Zhong Shang\u2019s guess could not be blamed.</p><br/><p>I just didn\u2019t expect him to admit it so quickly\u2026</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang raised his eyebrows, \u201cWhy did you think of assassinating the Ping Wang? Aren\u2019t you afraid that he will take your life? \u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled weakly, \u201cMy life is worthless, whoever wants it can take it.\u201d It even seemed like it was going to break.</p><br/><p>When he went to Lord Ping\u2019s mansion yesterday, he had already thought about it. If he was unlucky and got caught, no matter how the other party forced him to confess, he would insist that it was the Provincial governor Lin who ordered it. He could not create trouble for Xie Zhen, even if he were to die, he had to blame it on the Provincial governor Lin, he was not afraid of death, but he would not be able to take revenge for Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>It was a pity that he missed. It was a pity that he was unable to kill the First Prince with a single strike.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang didn\u2019t know what kind of enmity he had with the First Prince, but he could guess about seventy to eighty percent of it. The First Prince and the Crown Prince were not on good terms. Yan Yu was a person of the Crown Prince, and Xie Zhen had married Yan Yu. It was too wishful thinking.</p><br/><p>Whether or not he could avoid Yan Yun was another question.</p><br/><p>But luckily they were in the army, so Yan Yun\u2019s men should not be able to search this place, and even if they searched, they would not be able to search too carefully, so he might be able to retrieve his life.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang sat at the side, his posture casual, \u201cYou failed this time, are you still planning to go in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang raised his eyebrows.</p><br/><p>However, he said, \u201cBecause I found a more valuable piece of information.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat news?\u201d</p><br/><p>He propped himself up to speak. He treated Zhong Shang as his brother, so he didn\u2019t try to hide anything. \u201cEarlier, the doctor said that I was only poisoned by the Western Yi\u2019s poison, and that we had almost cut off all contact with the Western Yi in the recent years. Shang Jia also rarely sells the things they have, let alone this kind of rare poison. But since the First Prince has it, why don\u2019t you tell me? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang propped his chin up and laughed sloppily: \u201cYou suspect that he is in contact with the People of Western Yi?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s very possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although he did not know the reason behind the relationship between the Ping Wang and the Western Yi, but if the Emperor Yuan Hui knew about this matter, it would definitely infuriate the entire Emperor Yuan Hui, and at that time, Yan Yun would not have a good ending. The Emperor Yuan Hui had been suspecting that the Ping Wang was guilty of causing trouble recently. If he added a label of colluding with other realms, his meticulously planned plan for many years would come to an end.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun asked Zhong Shang to prepare a letter for him. He wanted to write a letter to An Wang\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang took out a pen and paper.</p><br/><p>He sat on the bed and began to write on the small square table. The letter did not mention anything about him assassinating Yan Yun. It only mentioned that it had seen that the First Prince was in contact with the People of Western Yi and suspected that he was colluding with him. It told Yan Yu to pay more attention to the First Prince\u2019s movements and prepare sufficient evidence to report to the Emperor Yuan Hui.</p><br/><p>After writing it, Gao Xun sealed it with fire lacquer and sent it to An Wang\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang looked at him with a complicated gaze, making him puzzled. \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long while, Zhong Shang finally said: \u201cAre you doing this for the An Wang, or for the An Wang Fei?\u201d</p><br/><p>It hit the nail on the head.</p><br/><p>He was speechless, and his face had the look of someone who had just been exposed, \u201c\u2026 They were old friends of mine when I was a child, so of course I wish them both well. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang laughed, \u201cI hope you really think so.\u201d After which, he walked out of the tent.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun sat on the bed alone and thought for a long time.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>When Yan Yu received the letter, two days had already passed since the news of the King Ping\u2019s assassination.</p><br/><p>In the assassination of the Prince, the first suspect was the Crown Prince. However, Yan Yun was unable to find any clues related to them, and even if he wanted to frame them, he was unable to find the reason.</p><br/><p>However, the black clothed man\u2019s clothes were found at the back door of Provincial governor Lin\u2019s Palace. Lin Rui knelt in the courtyard of Lord Ping\u2019s mansion for three days to prove his innocence. Even though Yan Yun knew it couldn\u2019t be him, he couldn\u2019t help but vent his anger on him. Who asked him to be so stupid? He didn\u2019t even know that he had been framed in front of his house!</p><br/><p>When this matter reached Emperor Yuan Hui\u2019s ears, he knew that she was his own son. He assigned the three imperial physicians to treat Duke Ping\u2019s wounds and removed a portion of the people who were monitoring the Lord Ping\u2019s mansion. The Prince\u2019s mood was not as bad as it used to be.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu opened the letter and placed it on the table, looking at it with thoughtfully for a long time.</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen arrived, he was still reading the letter.</p><br/><p>\u201cservant maids said that you don\u2019t want to eat. What are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was silent for a moment, then folded the letter and placed it in his sleeve. Shaking his head, he said, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she stood up and held Xie Zhen\u2019s hand, and they went to the hall for a meal.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

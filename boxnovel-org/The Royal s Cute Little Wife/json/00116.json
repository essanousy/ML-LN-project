After all, she knew she was wrong. But at that time, she didn\u2019t have any other choice. Zhong Shang had been waiting for so long, he couldn\u2019t possibly continue waiting, right?</p><br/><p>Xie Xun had already admitted her wrongs with Madam Leng, and guaranteed that nothing like this would happen again in the future. However, Madam Leng was still not satisfied, and wanted her to break off all relations with Zhong Shang.</p><br/><p>What did big brother Zhong Shang do wrong?</p><br/><p>She thought about it for a long time but still couldn\u2019t understand. Zhong Shang had come to the house before as well and her mother had never shown such rejection. In the past, Madam Leng treated him as an ordinary junior. Why did mother changed so much? What she did not know was that, Madam Leng used to treat him as an unrelated young man, and it had nothing to do with her family, so she had a heart of tolerance. But now, he actually wanted to harm her own daughter? That would be different! Looking at a junior and looking at a son-in-law were two completely different things.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun had not thought it through clearly, and with Xie Zhen asking her this question, she was naturally suspicious, \u201csis doesn\u2019t like Big Brother Zhong Shang either?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had a bad feeling for Zhong Shang, because she knew that guy did not behave probably. She had kept her distance from him. She never thought that he would actually be entangled with her own sister. A girl as innocent as Ah Xun wasn\u2019t even on the same side as him!</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought about it, and felt that she still couldn\u2019t let Zhong Shang spoil Xie Xun too much. She only had this little sister of her, so of course she would want her to live a better life than others. \u201cI did not like him. I heard Gao Xun talk about him in the past \u2026. \u201d When she mentioned the word \u201cGao Xun\u201d, she went slightly stiff, as the image of Gao Xun\u2019s warm and bright smile appeared in her mind. She unconsciously tightened her grip on the beauty on the bed, and only when Xie Xun called for her, did she recover from her trance. \u201cHe is the little overlord of the capital, and every commoner has to hide and leave when they see him. He is an object that no one dares to offend. \u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun would never take the initiative to tell her all of these, it was because she was worried about her sister and hence she forced him to tell her about it.</p><br/><p>After listening to her talk about those examples, Xie Xun found it hard to imagine how Zhong Shang used to fight with other people, \u201cI think he\u2019s doing pretty good now \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That was because General Zhong was in charge of him and threw him into the military camp to gain experience! It was hard to change one\u2019s nature. Who knew if he would change back in the future?</p><br/><p>In order to brainwash Xie Xun, Xie Zhen told her all of Zhong Shang\u2019s dark history. What if he got into a fight with someone today, fought with someone as a dog with someone else tomorrow, and went to the casino to gamble money in a few days \u2026 Hearing Xie Xun\u2019s words, she sighed, she had never known about any of these!</p><br/><p>Finally, Xie Zhen came to a conclusion and concluded it with a sentence: \u201cIn short, you don\u2019t need to contact him anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun frowned her bun face in distress, \u201cActually \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, she didn\u2019t think that Xie Zhen\u2019s words were serious, because it was all in the past now and Zhong Shang had changed a lot compared to before. Even though he looked like a scoundrel when he smiled, there was still a big difference in his bones. She had also never seen him interact with any of his bad friends before. The people he made friends with were all noble children of the capital, and their words were not as bad as Xie Zhen and Madam Leng had said them to be.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun did not know how she understood it so much, she could not help but want to defend Zhong Shang, but seeing Xie Zhen\u2019s indignant face, the words flew around her mouth before she swallowed it back.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen asked: \u201cActually what?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her pursed her lips, changed her tone: \u201cI won\u2019t contact Big Brother Zhong Shang, but Big Brother Zhong Shang will come look for me \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That\u2019s true.</p><br/><p>I can\u2019t possibly make a trip to the General\u2019s Estate and tell General Zhong that your son shouldn\u2019t look for my sister in the future, right?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought, and thought of a good idea, so she told Xie Xun.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun did not have any room to refute.</p><br/><p>That night, Xie Zhen and Yan Yu stayed at the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen lied in Yan Yu\u2019s arms and told him what had happened today, \u201c\u2026 A while ago, my father and mother fell for the young master of the Grand Secretariat Gu\u2019s family, Gu Yi. I feel that Gu Yi is much better than Zhong Shang, he is much more mature and steady, and will love Ah Xun a little more after marriage. \u201d</p><br/><p>But who would have thought that Yan Yu would fall silent after listening to this and then speak up for him, \u201cI had a few times interacted with Zhong Chongyuan at Lanling and he seemed to be frivolous, but he actually had a lot of ideas in his heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu rarely praised others, because he was aloof and proud, and it was already good enough that he did not look down on others. This was her first time to hear him praise another person.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was puzzled. \u201cWhen did your relationship with him become so good?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu paused for a moment, then said after a long while: \u201cWhen I was dealing with the matters about Gao Xun, we talked to each other.\u201d</p><br/><p>The room fell silent.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun was a topic that neither of them were willing to talk about. This person was like a thorn piercing into their hearts. Previously, the two of them didn\u2019t say anything, but purposefully avoided feeling sad. Now that they mentioned it without any warning, they realized that this matter was not over yet. Escaping was never an option, and what they should face had to be faced.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was quiet for a moment, then leaned against his chest and said with a low voice: \u201cAfter I finish giving birth, let\u2019s go back to Qing Zhou to take a look at Big Brother Gao Xun.\u201d</p><br/><p>This time Yan Yu did not resist, he patted her head and nodded: \u201cAlright.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, she recovered from her melancholy and continued to discuss Zhong Shang\u2019s topic with him.</p><br/><p>\u201cEven if he\u2019s as good as you say, forget about the past, then he came to the Jiaomen to find Xie Xun too hastily. Fortunately, he was found out by Mother, if someone saw him \u2026\u201d She stuttered, her tone softer than before, \u201cHe didn\u2019t think it through, but who knows if he was sincere towards Ah Xun. If he wanted to play with Ah Xun\u2019s feelings, I would definitely not allow it! This was the perfect opportunity to test him, to make him suffer, and to see his sincerity. If you pass through me, then I will be at ease and hand Ah Xun over to him. \u201d</p><br/><p>It was said that the elder sister was like a mother, this saying was not wrong at all. Xie Zhen couldn\u2019t even finish worrying about her own matters, and she even wanted to share her concern for Xie Xun?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu pinched her earlobes, laughed and asked: \u201cI\u2019ve walked so far today, are you tired?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was very honest and immediately said she was tired, \u201cBig brother Xiao Yu, help me massage my legs.\u201d</p><br/><p>As a pregnant woman, her body would easily become swollen. She listened to the doctor\u2019s advice, and every day, in addition to walking, she would get servant maids to pinch her legs to prevent bloating. Sometimes, with Yan Yu\u2019s help, over the past few months, he had become more proficient at it.</p><br/><p>At her request, he did not hesitate and let her sit up. He lifted her leg and placed it on his thigh. He then squeezed it a few times, \u201cIs that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded and giggled. \u201cIt\u2019s a little itchy \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu laughed and deliberately scratched the bottom of her foot, \u201cWhat about this?\u201d</p><br/><p>She laughed, her almond-shaped eyes were bent, and she wanted to pull her foot out, but he held her tightly, and she couldn\u2019t move at all, \u201cNot there! Big Brother Xiao Yu is such a bad guy! \u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, she was still worried about others and did not cause too much trouble. Yan Yu quickly let her go. He raised his head to wipe the tears from the corners of her eyes and said hoarsely, \u201cGo to sleep.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen covered her head with the mattress, grunted, and fell asleep not long after.</p><br/><p>They had stayed in Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion for the third day and Zhong Shang had indeed come again.</p><br/><p>This time, he did not walk through the entrance, but brought a meeting gift out in the open.</p><br/><p>Of course Xie Zhen wanted to meet him. Not only did she want to see him, she even prepared a long string of words to say to him. Madam Leng was originally going to come as well, but was held down by Xie Zhen and told not to show her face for the time being.</p><br/><p>After arriving at central room, Zhong Shang stood straight in his green lotus attire, with two jade pendants and a Talisman hanging around his waist. Xie Zhen could not help but look at the Talisman two more times, and only felt that it looked familiar, no matter how he looked at it, he quickly remembered, wasn\u2019t this what Xie Xun was wearing?</p><br/><p>When did he get it?</p><br/><p>Although she was puzzled in her heart, he pretended to be calm on the surface. Xie Zhen sat on the palisander\u2019s Eight Immortal Chair and said to Zhong Shang: \u201cYoung Master Zhong, please sit as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu followed and sat beside her.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang did not stand on ceremony. He lifted his robes and sat opposite to him. His handsome face had a polite smile, this time he did not smile sloppily, but more seriously. He went straight to the point: \u201cIs Little Sister Ah Xun doing well?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen took a sip of Jade Spiral Spring that the servant maids brought over, and slowly said: \u201cNot so good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang immediately frowned, and stood up: \u201cI want to see her.\u201d</p><br/><p>The last time he was discovered by Madam Leng, he wanted to stay and explain himself, but since Xie Xun was brought away by the nannie and he was rejected, he could only return home temporarily. However, he was still worried when he returned home. He was worried that Xie Xun would be wronged, hence he came over again every few days.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen raised her head, and laughed: \u201cWhat status does Young Master Zhong have to be able to see Ah Xun? Ah Xun is a young lady who has yet to leave the pavilion, she is not related to you in any way, so it is one thing for you to see her secretly at Jiaomen, now do you want to meet her in public in my house? \u201d</p><br/><p>There was a thorn in her words, Zhong Shang finally understood what she meant.</p><br/><p>This was to let himself know the difficulty of the matter and retreat.</p><br/><p>He relaxed and sat back down on his seat, staring at Xie Zhen, \u201cI just want to meet her in broad daylight. Does An Wang Fei agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen shook her head, there was no room for negotiation, \u201cNo.\u201d Drinking a mouthful of tea, she continued, \u201cNot only that, I hope that you won\u2019t come looking for her in the future, lest you ruin my sister\u2019s reputation.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang frowned.</p><br/><p>She pretended not to see, and said word by word: \u201cMy mother have already arranged a marriage for Ah Xun. If you are truly doing well for Ah Xun, then don\u2019t look for her again in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang suddenly stood up from his chair, almost knocking over the square table\u2019s teacup. His expression was one of shock. Gritting his teeth, he asked, \u201cWho will she marry?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen lowered her head and took a sip of tea: \u201cGu family\u2019s young master, Gu Yi.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026. It\u2019s him again!</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang had a feeling that his wife was being stolen away, so he calmed himself down with difficulty. He wanted to know how the situation was progressing and whether or not he could save her: \u201cHas the Gu family come to propose marriage? Is the engagement fixed? \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said calmly: \u201cI have already been very satisfied with these eight words, father and mother are both very satisfied. Ah Xun and Eldest Young Master Gu are the same, after marriage, they should meet up to full. \u201d</p><br/><p>In truth, Madam Leng and Xie Liqing only had this intention and had not revealed it to the Gu family, nor was it correct. The reason why she said that, was just to provoke Zhong Shang, she wanted to see how he would react.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang stood frozen for a long time. Without saying a word, Xie Zhen curiously raised his head and saw that his expression was not good. The corner of his mouth that was usually raised curled up slightly, showing his displeasure.</p><br/><p>He clenched his fists and said in a deep voice, \u201cWhat if the General\u2019s Estate comes first to propose?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was finally forced to say this.</p><br/><p>He probably didn\u2019t understand how important he viewed Xie Xun.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen smiled, \u201cThat will depend on whether father and mother agree to marry Ah Xun to you. You must know, my father likes Young Master Gu to be so knowledgeable, so courteous, and so young, and not a reckless man like Young Master Zhong.\u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking, Zhong Shang\u2019s face turned even uglier.</p><br/><p>In other words, if he wanted to marry her, he had to curry favor with her parents?</p><br/>\n</div>"}

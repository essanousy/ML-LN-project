He felt that one children was not enough, so he needed to have at least three or four children.</p><br/><p>When he told Xie Zhen his idea, Xie Zhen was quiet for a while.</p><br/><p>Without waiting for her reply, he changed his words and said, \u201cNo \u2026 Five. \u201d</p><br/><p>Three boys and two girls were just perfect. Their daughters should be all like her. Their sons could be taught slowly, one to take the pen, one to take the sword, and one to be doted on by them as they grew up freely. His thoughts were perfect, but Xie Zhen\u2019s face was completely reddened, and she pushed him away: Who wants to give birth to so many children for you? You wish!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was standing at the edge of the corridor, shaken by her push, and was about to fall down.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen subconsciously held onto his hand, but how could her strength exceed his? He pulled her gently into his arms and they fell to the ground together.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not feel much pain, because she was completely protected by Yan Yu.</p><br/><p>She looked up and saw his thin, smiling lips. \u201cYou did it on purpose!\u201d</p><br/><p>He intentionally pulled her down to see her make a fool of herself.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu straightened his back and sat on the ground, not caring about how dirty the ground was. It was a good thing that all the surrounding servant maids were scattered by them, if not they would be seen by others, would they not be made a joke by others? Xie Zhen thought absentmindedly. He gently bit her and pressed his lips to her face and asked: \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>A crafty look flashed across Xie Zhen\u2019s eyes, \u201cI\u2019m thinking, did big brother Xiao Yu eat fennel at noon?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu paused for a moment, then released her. His brows knitted together as he looked at her in silence.</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026. Did he lose his pride?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen giggled, and took the initiative to kiss his mouth, \u201cDid you forget that I was eating too? \u201cIt\u2019s not like I hate you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not say a word with his her mouth a thin line, and stared fixedly at her with a pair of pitch-black eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought that he was really angry, and bit and bit on his lips. Just as he was about to give up, he suddenly wrapped around her like a big dog and fiercely kissed her once before stopping. Xie Zhen\u2019s mouth was swollen, he really did not know whether he was a close relative or an enemy, \u201cCan\u2019t you be a little lighter?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu carried her and sat her down, placing her behind the in the porch. He raised his hand and caressed her lips, \u201cSo it won\u2019t swell just because it\u2019s light?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow should I know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as she fell to the ground, she was once again pressed by him to kiss her. The collar of her clothes was ajar, revealing the smooth skin of her neck. He felt a sudden thirst in his throat. It was not like he had never seen one before, but every time he saw one, his mouth would go dry because he knew how lovely and delicate his skin was under the cloth.</p><br/><p>His eyes were burning hot, to the point that Xie Zhen couldn\u2019t ignore them. She took a step back and looked at him warily, \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu looked away, \u201cNothing.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026. Who would believe it!</p><br/><p>In broad daylight, Xie Zhen didn\u2019t want to start a fight with him here. She hurriedly got up, and was prepared to go back and change into a new set of clothes. However, he was too anxious when he got up. His left foot stepped on the hem of his skirt. He leaned his body forward and threw himself forward. Yan Yu was sitting right in front of her, and she was lying on top of him, snuggling close to his chest.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu took the opportunity and hugged her waist, lowering his head to whisper into her ear and sighed: \u201cSo soft.\u201d</p><br/><p>Knowing what he was referring to, Xie Zhen burned his face from the back of his ears.</p><br/><p>Her breasts were full, and she couldn\u2019t hold one hand, but they were just fine for him. Especially after the two of them had made a full marriage, he would play with her every night, making her too embarrassed to look anyone in the eye.</p><br/><p>What\u2019s there to look at! she thought weakly, but he was never tired of it.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen propped him up by his chest, then pouted and scolded: \u201cYou are shameless!\u201d</p><br/><p>He was becoming more and more shameless. Not only did he not refute her words, he even carried her in his arms and walked into the house, intending to shamelessly beat her up.</p><br/><p>Ever since Xie Rong had received Gu Yi\u2019s painting, he had gone to the Grand Secretariat\u2019s mansion twice. For example, the two liked to play chess. If they could just sit under the tree for a whole day, they would have forgotten to even eat lunch.</p><br/><p>They had never known each other before, but they never expected that their personalities would be so compatible.</p><br/><p>After Xie Rong and Gu Yi finished their last game of chess, Hei Zi was forced into a dead end by Bai Zi. There was no chance of survival. Xie Rong prepared to leave the house, but on the way he passed by a courtyard. The sound of a zither could be heard from the courtyard, it was unlike the gentle worries of a normal girl, it was actually a type of open-minded and relaxed tune. Xie Rong stopped outside the courtyard for a moment. From the sound of the zither, he could hear the zither player\u2019s relaxed state of mind. He could not help but pick up a bamboo leaf beside him, and put it between his lips and started playing.</p><br/><p>For a moment, two voices resounded in the air above the courtyard. Their coordination was extremely ingenious.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong only blew for a while before giving up. He retrieved the bamboo leaves and continued to walk with a normal expression.</p><br/><p>Just now was just a whim. He felt that the other party\u2019s melody was pleasing to the ear and wanted to chime in a few times. He didn\u2019t want trouble.</p><br/><p>After a dozen or so steps, he arrived at the entrance of the same courtyard as before.</p><br/><p>He walked past the door and sensed a gaze landing on his body. He turned his head to see that Gu Ruyi was sitting in the courtyard with a guqin in front of him. She gave him a polite smile and didn\u2019t ask or say much, like two people meeting by chance and nodding at each other.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong replied with a smile and left with big strides.</p><br/><p>After that, when he came to the Grand Secretariat\u2019s mansion again, he would occasionally meet Gu Ruyi. Gu Ruyi knew that he was proficient in music, and once, when he was playing the zither, he encountered a few notes that he didn\u2019t understand well, so he took the opportunity of Gu Yi\u2019s presence to consult him. He answered for her, Gu Yi smiled and said, \u201cI can\u2019t really say anything like this, so why don\u2019t you demonstrate it to Yongchang on purpose?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong had learned zither music when he was thirteen or fourteen years old, at that time, Xie Liqing had specially invited him to be Mr. Instrument so that he could soften his playing and not keep a cold face. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t seem to be of much use.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong sat behind the zither, his long and resolute hand on the zither, not appearing too out of nowhere. He played a few notes without explaining anything, and then directly played an entire \u201cGrand Dominance Melody\u201d.</p><br/><p>During this time, Gu Yi\u2019s servant came over and told him that the Grand Secretariat Gu had something to talk to him about and told him to leave.</p><br/><p>Only Xie Rong and Gu Ruyi were left.</p><br/><p>After Xie Rong finished playing, he asked: \u201cDo you understand now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gu Ruyi shook his head, \u201cI still don\u2019t quite understand \u2026. For example, just now, this place \u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>She pointed to a spot on the zither music sheet, and her long black hair slid down her shoulders, bringing with it a faint fragrance. Before she could finish her words, she heard a question from in front of her, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong and Gu Ruyi raised their heads, only to see Princess He Yi and two palace maidservant s standing at the entrance of the courtyard, staring at them without blinking.</p><br/><p>Gu Ruyi took half a step back, \u201cYao An \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yao\u2019an glared at them fiercely, he never thought that she would see this kind of scene. When she came to the Grand Secretariat\u2019s mansion on a whim today, she even took the imperial snacks to have a taste with Yan Yao\u2019an. But she never thought that she would be together with Xie Rong, moreover \u2026 And they were so close!</p><br/><p>Her eyes slowly turned red as she angrily rebuked, \u201cYou all, you all went too far!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she took the sandalwood box from palace maidservant\u2019s hands and ruthlessly threw it on the ground, smashing the pastries and dried fruits on the ground. She turned around and ran out of the courtyard, never wanting to see the two of them again.</p><br/><p>Gu Ruyi\u2019s face turned anxious, although he did not know why she was angry, he had to explain his relationship with Xie Rong. Thus, she ignored Xie Rong and chased after him.</p><br/><p>\u201cYaan!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong sat under the tree without moving until Gu Yi came back. Seeing that he was the only one there, he asked in bewilderment, \u201cWhere\u2019s Ru Yi?\u201d</p><br/><p>He stood up, but didn\u2019t explain anything. \u201cI\u2019ll take my leave first. I\u2019ll follow you, we\u2019ll meet again another day.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he walked out of the courtyard.</p><br/><p>Although Gu Yi was puzzled, he didn\u2019t ask any further questions.</p><br/><p>He thought that this was just a small episode, but who would have thought that ten days later, the people of the Rites Department and Eunuch Gao came to Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion with their imperial edict.</p><br/><p>Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion was shocked, what was going on this time?</p><br/><p>The people of the Residence of Yun knelt in front of the imperial edict. The first son of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, Xie Rong, was known as Yongchang, well-versed in literature, was known as Liu Tao, was rich in knowledge, and was a brave fighter \u2026 She was beautiful and dignified, and had specially bestowed the Princess He Yi with the title of Prince Consort. \u201cI am very pleased that the main wedding ceremony will be held one day \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>However, half of them didn\u2019t hear what was said after that.</p><br/><p>When Eunuch Gao finished announcing the imperial edict, everyone\u2019s gaze turned towards the kneeling Xie Rong. His head was slightly bowed, and his expression could not be seen.</p><br/><p>Eunuch Gao said with a smile, \u201cThank you young master, please accept the decree.\u201d</p><br/><p>After waiting for a while, there was no sign of him.</p><br/><p>The smile on Eunuch Gao\u2019s face could not bear it.</p><br/><p>He kowtowed and said firmly, \u201cI beg your pardon.\u201d</p><br/><p>Eunuch Gao\u2019s face stiffened, his eyebrows creasing as well. \u201cWhat do you mean? Could it be that Young Master Xie wants to disrespect the edict? \u201d When he said that last sentence, his tone was already a bit more severe.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing and Madam Leng did not know why, but they looked at their son worriedly.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong hardened his heart, \u201cThis subject cannot \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEvil creature!\u201d The old mistress suddenly scolded and turned to smile apologetically at Eunuch Gao. \u201cThis child was just muddle-headed for a moment and said some nonsense. I hope Eunuch Gao will not take offense \u2026\u201d You can leave this imperial edict behind, I will convince him to agree. \u201d With that, he called for someone to escort Eunuch Gao out of the manor.</p><br/><p>After Eunuch Gao left, Xie Liqing helped the Madam Leng up from the ground, and asked in panic: \u201cRonger, what exactly happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong frowned, thinking back to the day when he ran away from Grand Secretariat\u2019s mansion while crying. That was the last time they would meet, and he did not say anything back then, nor did he give her any illusions.</p><br/><p>He calmed his mind, picked up the imperial edict on top of the square table, and said, \u201cI\u2019m going to the palace to see His Majesty.\u201d</p><br/><p>The madame called out to him in exasperation, \u201cCome back here!\u201d</p><br/><p>As if he didn\u2019t hear her, he strode out.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

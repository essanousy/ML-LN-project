Although Xie Zhen was not knocked down, she was still frightened. As a result, the imperial physician wrote a prescription for calming the fetus and told her to follow it. Apart from that, there shouldn\u2019t be any major problems.</p><br/><p>After returning to the palace, Xie Zhen did not dare to delay any further, and immediately ordered the medicine to be used according to the prescription.</p><br/><p>By the time the medicine was ready, it was already late at night. She was so sleepy that she couldn\u2019t stop fighting, but she still forced herself to drink the medicine. The smell of medicine was extremely bitter, causing her to be speechless. On the other hand, she was much more clear-headed now. Yan Yu handed over a Green Plum Fruit as she bit into it with relish. She looked up at Yan Yu and asked, \u201cToday, His Majesty is going to let Chen Yingxue be your side imperial concubine. Why didn\u2019t you agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>What a question.</p><br/><p>Why didn\u2019t he agree? Didn\u2019t she know? If he agreed, it wouldn\u2019t be a good result for him until he came back, right?</p><br/><p>However, this girl wanted him to personally say it. She had been holding herself back all the way back, so she was probably waiting for him to say something nice to coax her.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu handed the bowl over to servant maids and let him take it off. He sat on the palisander s that were on the opposite side of the bed and curled his lips: \u201cYou want me to agree?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t hope for that to happen. She shook the blanket covering her and pretended not to care at all, \u201cI just don\u2019t care \u2026\u201d She spoke very slowly. Halfway through her words, she suddenly turned around and smiled at him. Her smile was so bright that it was even more dazzling than the stars outside the window. I had already thought about it long ago. If Big Brother Xiao Yu had another woman, I would take my child and leave you, and marry someone who will never be able to take in a concubine. \u201d</p><br/><p>Da Jing had ruled the country for hundreds of years. The people were open-minded, did not care about small details, and were very forgiving towards women who were divorced. If a woman was divorced, not only would she not be discriminated against, but there would also be a matchmaker who would come visit her and propose marriage. This kind of thing was not normal, but it wasn\u2019t special either. There were already a few examples in the circle of noble ladies. For example, Zhong Rou\u2019s second sister, Zhong Yun, had already left her husband and had also married the Marquis of Yongle\u2019s second son.</p><br/><p>Therefore, when Xie Zhen just finished speaking, his face darkened, \u201cMarry again?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had only asked her one question and she wanted to leave him and marry again? Was he so unworthy of her trust? He really wanted to see how the girl\u2019s heart had done it.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen blinked her eyes, \u201cAh \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Did he not hear her premise clearly? She meant that if he had any other woman, she would have to leave him!</p><br/><p>It was a pity that Yan Yu was so angry that he lost his mind. He sat on the side of the bed and held her wrist, as if he was afraid that she would run away.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen choked, her hands being pinched so hard they hurt, as she struggled to stand back and retort: \u201cWhat are you so anxious for? I haven\u2019t left yet! \u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t manage to break free even after a while. Instead, she was pulled into his embrace and rolled into the bed. He pressed her head so hard that she could not move. He was so frightened by what she had said that he said in a threatening tone, \u201cIf you dare to leave me and marry again, I will not let off him whoever you marry!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time he had said such harsh words. His eyebrows were furrowed, and his fists were clenched tightly around her, as if he had already imagined the appearance of that person. When Xie Zhen saw him, she couldn\u2019t help but curl her lips and roll over onto the pillow. Her shoulders trembled a little, and she was actually laughing so hard that she was about to pass out.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was obviously very serious and angry, but seeing that her smile had lost all of its imposing aura, she immediately became a little embarrassed, grabbing onto her soft waist and asked: \u201cWhat are you laughing about?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was laughing non-stop, tears were even forced out from the corner of her eyes as she pointed at\u2019s nose and said, \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu seems to be a tyrant that can turn a good girl into a prostitute!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu couldn\u2019t help but touch his face. How did it look like it?</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t feel so, but Xie Zhen\u2019s laughter made his stomach ache instead. She held her stomach and laughed for a long time, until Yan Yu was completely speechless. He leaned over, pressed against her forehead and asked depressingly: \u201cIs it that funny?\u201d</p><br/><p>Ever since she was young, she had always felt that she was a heartless little girl. She had never thought that she would grow up to be like this. Thinking about it this way, Yan Yu still felt dissatisfied. He bit onto her nose, biting her until she moaned and begged for mercy, only then did he let go.</p><br/><p>\u201cStill laughing?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s eyes were moist, like the stars in the galaxy. With just a glance, she could attract people\u2019s attention. Her lips curved, and she could not even muster the strength to laugh. She panted, \u201cNo more laughing \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu snorted, rolling over and lying beside her, no longer pressing down on her, and instead wrapping his arms around her stomach. Recently, he had been stroking her stomach, massaging it round and round, as if he could feel the movement of a life inside. \u201cYou were at the palace feast today. Didn\u2019t you hear that I rejected her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu bet that Xie Zhen, the little bastard, had definitely heard her. At that time, she had given him a threatening look.</p><br/><p>He did not expect Xie Zhen to be so sincere as she smiled and nodded, \u201cI heard it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu frowned, his hand moved to grab onto the soft meat bun on her chest and rubbed it with force, as if he was venting his anger: \u201cThen why are you still angry at me?\u201d</p><br/><p>His grip was extremely smooth, making it so that Xie Zhen had no place to hide. In front of him was his hand, and behind him was his chest. She moaned. Because the fetus had been unstable, they had never had sex because of the doctor\u2019s advice. Now that the fetus was stable, it had already been half a month. Yan Yu couldn\u2019t help but to touch her around, but it was all stopped by Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>Right now, she didn\u2019t know if they could \u2026 Xie Zhen felt a bit of pain from his hand, she grabbed his hand and begged him to be gentle, \u201cWho said I\u2019m angry at you? Have you ever heard of it? \u201cUgh \u2026\u201d He increased his strength. She was already sensitive to his presence. \u201cYou refused today. In the future, when His Majesty finds a second and third side imperial concubine for you, can you still refuse?\u201d Can you keep refusing? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu really did not think about this question seriously. His actions paused for a moment, and then he started to play with her pair of little buns, causing her to make a sweet and melodious sound. He said matter-of-factly, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>As long as he didn\u2019t want to, no one could force him.</p><br/><p>No matter how many people Emperor Yuan Hui wanted to give him, he didn\u2019t want them at all.</p><br/><p>It was enough to have her in his arms.</p><br/><p>However, after hearing what she said, he had to face up to one problem. The Emperor Yuan Hui wanted to use Chen Yingxue to test if he was interested in the position of Emperor. Emperor Yuan Hui should have known of his decision, so there shouldn\u2019t be such a thing in the future \u2026 His only worry was that Yan Tao would overthink things and cause harm to him and Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen arched her back in his embrace, and his rubbing made her body go limp, as she snorted: \u201cI know, I got it. Let go of me. The doctor said that I can\u2019t \u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl had grown into a big girl, even her two buns on her breasts had grown quite a bit. Originally, he was only able to hold one of them with one hand, but now that she was pregnant, her breasts had also grown bigger. But he liked it so much. He liked to bite her breasts, to the point that he could not stop her.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was both embarrassed and annoyed, seeing that he was about to bury his head in her chest, she raised her hand and pushed him away: \u201cBrother Xiao Yu, don\u2019t be like this \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He refused to listen and shamelessly asked, \u201cLittle Lamb, why isn\u2019t milk here?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could she answer this question!?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s beautiful face flushed red. Although the two of them had been in the same room for a long time and had done everything before when closing the door, it did not mean that she had to get used to listening to his vulgar words! \u201cHow, how would I know!\u201d</p><br/><p>He took a couple of sips, her embarrassed, angry voice in his ear, then added, \u201cI\u2019ll ask the doctor tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shameless!</p><br/><p>If he were to ask the doctor, where would she put her face?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s cheeks were flushed red, her almond eyes were moist, she bit her lips and kept quiet, her hands being held firmly above her head, she was truly bullied to the point of being pitiful. Finally touched by his shamelessness, she stammered, \u201cMother said \u2026 You had to wait for a few more months \u2026 Woo \u2026 Stop it\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>For the sake of her body, he had been unable to touch her for a long time.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu lifted his head and covered her chattering lips, their lips touching. It was only until she almost gasped for breath that he released her.</p><br/><p>Originally, Xie Zhen had planned to sleep the moment she returned to the manor. But who knew that he had unknowingly delayed this for more than an hour, causing her to be unable to even sleep when she wanted to. In the end, she really couldn\u2019t take it anymore. He was still kissing her ear on one side and she was already fast asleep on the other.</p><br/><p>Her eyes were closed, and her eyelashes, long and raised like butterfly wings, drooped wearily. The wings of her nose fluttered, and her pink lips parted slightly. No matter how she looked at it, she was pleasing to the eye. It seems that she was really tired, Yan Yu stopped messing with her, and helped her tidy up her clothes, then lowered his head to touch her forehead, \u201cToday, I will forgive you.\u201d</p><br/><p>She could not hear him and had long since fallen asleep. However, his subconscious also knew how to cling to him. Both of his hands rested on his neck, rubbing against his chest.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu enjoyed it and chuckled softly. He blew out the lamp and slept with her.</p><br/><p>After five months, Xie Zhen\u2019s stomach finally became a little more obvious.</p><br/><p>She had a slim waist and a perfect curve when she raised it slightly. She was very beautiful. Yan Yu liked to hug her the most, while rubbing her round stomach. Or maybe when she was changing her clothes, he would do nothing but stand by the side and look at her with an expression of infatuation and love.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the weather grew colder and colder with each passing day, and the clothes she was wearing grew larger and larger, completely covering the curves of Xie Zhen\u2019s stomach. A thick cloak fell over her, obscuring his view.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was a little disappointed. He returned from the imperial court, and wanted to touch her stomach, but he was blocked by layers of clothes. His large hand reached into her cloak and gently touched it. \u201cIs there any movement today?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen shook her head, \u201cNo, it\u2019s very obedient today.\u201d</p><br/><p>A few days ago, Xie Zhen coincidentally discovered that the child in her belly had a movement.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen suddenly felt that it was very mysterious. After raising it for so long, she finally had a sense of accomplishment. So she told it to Yan Yu.</p><br/><p>She never thought that Yan Yu would be even more obsessed with it than she was. Every day when he came back, he would ask her if her child had made any movements. What he liked to do the most was hug her as they sat in the in the porch, discussing what name to give his child when it was snowing.</p><br/><p>From a distance, the two of them looked like one person. He hugged her and lowered his head to whisper in her ear. Her almond-shaped eyes curved up to meet his.</p><br/><p>They could talk for half a day just by talking.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

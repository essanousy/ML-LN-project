The words Xie Zhen had said just now still reverberating in his mind.</p><br/><p>She said that even without Yan Yu, it would be impossible for her to marry him. She only treated him as her good brother and didn\u2019t like him. The person she liked was Yan Yu. She even told him to find a good girl in the capital and be a good husband \u2026 Gao Xun was speechless. His right hand, which had held onto the cup before, trembled uncontrollably as he used his left hand to support it. \u201cJust pretend I didn\u2019t say anything, and pretend I never came tonight. \u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he turned and walked out of the central room.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen wanted to go up and send him off, but she was pulled back by Yan Yu, who said, \u201cLet him go back by himself.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was not at ease, she kept having the feeling that something would happen to him while he was on the street, but then she thought for a moment, if she sent him off again, it would be to give him hope. If she gave him hope over and over again, he might as well let her see it for him and let it go for good. After she thought it through, she called over one of the more astute servant s from the Palace, \u201cFollow Gao Xun, don\u2019t let him find your whereabouts. Wait until he safely returns to the army camp, then come back.\u201d</p><br/><p>servant answered and turned to follow.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu pulled her back to the Zhanyue Court. His expression was never too good, his thin lips tightly pursed, his handsome face showing a stern and stern expression.</p><br/><p>He did not speak, and neither did Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had made it very clear that she had hurt Gao Xun\u2019s heart and she was still blaming herself a little.</p><br/><p>If she had been pretending to be stupid, perhaps they could still maintain a pure friendship. Now that she had spoken, perhaps she wouldn\u2019t even be a friend in the future. But if he did not speak of it openly, it would instead cause Gao Xun to hold onto an extravagant hope that was close to being unreal. This way of treating him was truly unfair, and would also cause trouble for her and Yan Yu.</p><br/><p>Therefore, even if she blamed herself, she wouldn\u2019t regret it.</p><br/><p>When they were almost to the Zhanyue Court, Yan Yu stopped at the last part of the hand roaming corridor. Borrowing the last bit of the dim yellow light in the west, he turned his head and stared at her charming face, \u201cWhat you said just now \u2026 Is that true? \u201d</p><br/><p>He finally couldn\u2019t hold it in any longer.</p><br/><p>All along the way, Xie Zhen had been guessing when he would ask her this question, but she didn\u2019t expect him to endure for so long, so she thought he would ask her whenever he was at central room. I just said so much, what do you mean? \u201d</p><br/><p>She feigned ignorance, blinking her big watery eyes at him.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu paused, the corner of his mouth curled, and pulled out an unnatural curve, \u201cYou said that you were willing to marry me, that phrase \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen put his hands behind his back, and gave a long \u2018oh\u2019. She winked at him, looking strange and sly, and walked slowly around him, \u201cOf course it\u2019s fake. At that time, Big Brother Xiao Yu was so bad to me, why would I want to marry you? I said that on purpose for Big Brother Gao Xun to hear, and only then will he give up. \u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he finished speaking, Yan Yu held onto his shoulders tightly, and rubbed against his chest.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen staggered, her back pressed tightly against his chest, the corners of her lips curled up into an evil smile.</p><br/><p>She knew what he wanted to hear, but she didn\u2019t want him to do as he wished \u2026 It was as if she cared a lot about him. Although this was the truth, it was still impossible to guess the thoughts of a girl who loved to take dainties.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s chin was pressed against her shoulder sockets, and when he turned his head, he could see that she was smiling like a little fox. He bit into her tiny earlobe and asked with a straight face, \u201cWhat about now?\u201d</p><br/><p>She shrank away from him, but no matter where she went, she could not escape his embrace. She was tickled by his licking.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu hugged her tightly, he hated that he couldn\u2019t not keep her in his body, \u201cNow, you want to marry me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her laughter was crisp and pleasing to the ears, but the words she said were a little repulsive. \u201cHas Big Brother Xiao Yu become an idiot? What\u2019s the use of thinking about it now, I\u2019m already married to you anyway \u2026 \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do even if I don\u2019t want to \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he raised his hand to pry away the iron-like shoulder, and used his hand to fend off his face. \u201cLet go of me, I want servant to see what a terrible appearance you have!\u201d</p><br/><p>He could only blame her for being so eloquent that he could not refute her. He could only gnash his teeth and stare at her, loving and hating her. In the end, love was more than hate. Finally, she lightly kissed the back of her hand and lovingly complained, \u201cLittle bastard.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen retorted in his arms, \u201cI\u2019m not a little scoundrel\u201d.</p><br/><p>Probably because she thought his attitude was good, she came out from his arms and stood on the railing by the side of the corridor. She opened her arms and smiled: \u201cBrother Xiao Yu, hug me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was now half a head taller than him, and he usually looked down on her. It was a rare occasion that he was able to raise his head and look at her. Yan Yu walked up to her and obediently opened his arms. \u201cCome down, don\u2019t fall down.\u201d</p><br/><p>Without any warning, she jumped and landed steadily in his embrace. She subconsciously wrapped her arms around his neck, sticking close to his ear as if she was whispering, deliberately lowering her voice. \u201cIf I were to marry you now, I would definitely be willing \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu suddenly froze as he lowered his head to look at the delicate little girl in his arms.</p><br/><p>Before she finished speaking, she slowly enunciated each word. \u201cBecause, I like Big Brother Xiao Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unknowingly, the corner of Yan Yu\u2019s lips rose, the haze on his face was replaced by a smile, all that was left was a gentle and loving smile.</p><br/><p>He held her cheek against her forehead, eyes to eyes, nose to nose. \u201cHow much?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her cunning Wu Tong blinked and replied smartly: \u201cLike how Big Brother Xiao Yu likes me.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026. He really didn\u2019t want to lose anything.</p><br/><p>But this time, Yan Yu did not keep silent, a low \u201cEn\u201d came out of his throat. He kissed her pink lips, tossed and turned until her tongue hurt, then asked, \u201cHow do you know how much I like you?\u201d</p><br/><p>She opened her arms and gestured. \u201cThat much?\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at her and shook his head.</p><br/><p>Pointing from one end of the veranda to the other, she turned her head and asked curiously, \u201cSo many?\u201d</p><br/><p>He still shook his head.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was discouraged. He put his thumb and forefinger together to compare the size of a grain of rice, \u201cIt can\u2019t be this much, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Laughing lightly, he took her hand and placed it on his chest, letting her feel the thump of his chest. He asked her if she heard him, and she nodded and said she did, and he told her honestly, \u201cThere\u2019s so much of a heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was startled, and raised his head to look at his serious eyes.</p><br/><p>As expected, his next sentence was to ask: \u201cLittle Lamb, do you have this many?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had dug a hole for herself to jump into, so she couldn\u2019t even save herself.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a long time, she decided to answer honestly. I\u2019m a little less than you. \u201d After which, he gestured with his finger, which was about half the size of his finger, and emphasized, \u201cJust a tiny bit!\u201d</p><br/><p>In her heart, she was still pretending to be her father and mother, big brother Ah Xun \u2026 The rest of the seats had all been given to him. He should feel satisfied!</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not bother to argue with her, he was already very satisfied that he got too much information from her. He took her fingers and led her back. \u201cAs long as there\u2019s no other man.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen giggled as she followed behind him, and sweetly promised, \u201cI only like Big Brother Xiao Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>He curled his lips and led her slowly along.</p><br/><p>After losing three battles consecutively, the First Prince\u2019s morale had greatly plummeted. The several hundred thousand strong army sunk for more than half a month until one day, the First Prince called for the Western Yi\u2019s army to rescue them.</p><br/><p>The First Prince had long been in contact with the General of Western Yi, and had even went all out to seize the throne. He borrowed a hundred thousand troops and horses from the Western Yi and promised the patriarch of the Western Yi that if he were to attack the mountains and rivers of the Da Jing, he would cut off the seven richest cities at the border to give to the Western Yi as a thank-you gift. That was why the patriarch of the Western Yi agreed to borrow troops.</p><br/><p>Western Yi was a race of horses. Boys could ride horses before they had learned how to walk, could ride and shoot, and were brave enough to fight. Back then, Yan Yu had spent a lot of effort to defeat the People of Western Yi, but now, he had invited them back.</p><br/><p>However, Yan Yun\u2019s army had the help of the Western Yi\u2019s soldiers, and their morale had increased overnight. The battle drums rang across the sky, and the troops started to attack the city again that night.</p><br/><p>The People of Western Yi shot arrows from the bottom of the city wall, and before long, he killed half of the soldiers on the city wall.</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince summoned the General of Agile Cavalry to defend himself strictly. When one group of soldiers died, he would go up to the other group, determined not to let the People of Western Yi attack the city wall.</p><br/><p>City Lord Gao Yuan angrily scolded: \u201cThese traitors, actually managed to attract the People of Western Yi! These people are like wild wolves, they have no reason at all! \u201d</p><br/><p>On one side, Zhong Kai commanded his soldiers to welcome the battle, while on the other, he said to him, \u201cIt\u2019s useless to say these things now, the First Prince has completely gone mad \u2026 If you want to complain, the Mayor might as well send more men to guard the city gates. Some soldiers have already broken through the moat and started to ram into the gates! \u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Yuan was shocked and busied himself with his preparations.</p><br/><p>This battle had lasted two days and one night. Coincidentally, Gao Xun and Zhong Kai\u2019s army had arrived in time to save the lives of several tens of thousands of citizens in Lan Ling City. The leader was a twenty-five year old young general. The crown prince and the mayor received them personally and arranged a banquet overnight to thank them for coming in time.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang had not opened his eyes in advance and was unavoidably scolded.</p><br/><p>However, he felt gratified that his son had such a heart.</p><br/><p>The group of people sat together and drank, unknowingly talking about the current situation. When the First Prince Yan Yun was mentioned, everyone was filled with grief. They never thought that he would actually seek help from the People of Western Yi.</p><br/><p>After that, they fought another two battles. Gao Xun and Zhong Shang rode their horses up to battle, both of them suffering from large and small injuries, but they did not care at all. The more People of Western Yi was defeated, the more courageous he became, and Orchid Mountain City would probably not be able to hold on for much longer. From what the crown prince had told the First Prince, that the First Prince was planning a secret operation in secret, that his plans were extremely meticulous, that only he and the General of Western Yi knew about it, and that the others did not know anything at all.</p><br/><p>If this plan worked\u2026 Then the Lanling City will be destroyed.</p><br/><p>When the Crown Prince mentioned this matter, he frowned deeply. He asked the crowd, \u201cDo you have any ideas?\u201d</p><br/><p>Below them sat the City Lord Gao Yuan, General Li Shang, General of Agile Cavalry Zhong Kai and another young general, as well as Zhong Shang and Gao Xun.</p><br/><p>Everyone sank into deep thought. They knew that this plan was going to be very critical. It was related to success or failure, and couldn\u2019t be ignored. His top priority right now was to figure out the contents of the First Prince\u2019s plan \u2026 Only when they knew what they were planning would they be able to plan ahead and deal with them.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang pondered for a moment, then said: \u201cI \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, he was snatched away by Gao Xun, \u201cIf the Crown Prince trusts me, he will allow me to bring thirty people to the First Prince\u2019s tent at night.\u201d</p><br/><p>The crown prince was sitting on a treasured chair, facing for the first time the young man sitting at the very end. He was handsome, his facial features were sculpted, and he was at most twenty years old. However, her face was filled with tenacity, and her manner of speaking was also very calm.</p><br/><p>He remembered him and knew that his name was Gao Xun.</p><br/><p>In the last two battles, he was the vanguard as he fearlessly beheaded People of Western Yi, filled with vigor and vitality. Not only that, but he also used his shooting technique to kill the enemy from a hundred steps away. The deputy general of the Western Yi died under his arrow like this.</p><br/><p>He was recommended to him more than once.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao took it seriously, \u201cAre you confident?\u201d</p><br/><p>He stood up and loudly answered, \u201cYes, Your Highness!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Tao nodded, \u201cThen go and try to find out what their plans are. If you are discovered, don\u2019t try to be brave and come back alive. \u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded and said yes.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

They were afraid that they would accidentally enrage His Majesty.</p><br/><p>A long time later, Emperor Yuan Hui finally opened his mouth: \u201cYou said that Old Sixth sent people to assassinate you, do you have any evidence?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yun had someone present a treasured sword, so he said in a serious tone: \u201cThis weapon was picked up from the ground the night I was assassinated. There are carvings of Qilin markings on it, only the Sixth Brother\u2019s elite soldiers wear this weapon, father, please inspect it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Emperor Yuan Hui took it, and read it carefully over and over again, but did not say a word.</p><br/><p>Yan Yun was completely confident so he was not in a hurry at all.</p><br/><p>Emperor Yuan Hui returned the sword back to its original state.</p><br/><p>He was puzzled, \u201cfather \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as Emperor Yuan Hui was about to speak, a the young eunuch came in and reported, \u201cYour Majesty, this An Wang wishes to seek an audience.\u201d</p><br/><p>What a coincidence.</p><br/><p>Emperor Yuan Hui announced Yan Yu as he entered.</p><br/><p>Before long, Yan Yu appeared at the entrance of the hall wearing an indigo persimmon robe. He walked forward with wide steps, and when he saw Yan Yun kneeling inside the hall, he was startled. His eyes darkened, and calmly went forward to kneel in front of Emperor Yuan Hui. Emperor Yuan Hui did not let any of them go, and instead asked mischievously: \u201cWhat, you two brothers agreed to come over together?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yun looked at Yan Yu and called him \u201cSixth Brother\u201d against his will.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu, however, did not reply. He retrieved an item from his sleeve and handed it over to Emperor Yuan Hui, \u201cThis son has something that father can take a look at.\u201d</p><br/><p>Emperor Yuan Hui indicated for the eunuch by his side to take it.</p><br/><p>It was a letter painted with fire lacquer, and it stated the time and place Yan Yun had been in contact with the People of Western Yi the past two years. During the first year, they had not interacted much with each other. However, during the first half of this year, they had met with Western Yi\u2019s Great General Cha Ge\u2019er no less than five times.</p><br/><p>When Emperor Yuan Hui saw it, his expression turned ugly. He held the paper tightly and crumpled it, then threw it in front of the two of them.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not dead yet, but you guys can\u2019t sit still!\u201d He was extremely furious, taking the treasured sword from the elder\u2019s hands and pointing it at the two of them, he said angrily: \u201cBrother, what\u2019s wrong? To expose each other? \u201cDo you really want to sit in my place that badly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Since the time Yan Yun came, Emperor Yuan Hui was already not in a good mood. Now that Yan Yu had added fuel to the fire, he naturally could not help but explode.</p><br/><p>The contents of Yan Yu\u2019s letter could not not be trusted but also believed. Whether or not Yan Yun had come into contact with the People of Western Yi, had to be investigated thoroughly.</p><br/><p>However, this did not mean that he could just stand by and watch them fight amongst themselves.</p><br/><p>Emperor Yuan Hui\u2019s eyes were red, if not for his father-in-law\u2019s warning, he really would have stabbed a few holes into them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWeren\u2019t you saying a lot just now? Why are you not saying anything now?\u201d Emperor Yuan Hui gasped for breath as he sat back on the dragon throne.</p><br/><p>He was old and tired all the time, and his health was not as good as it used to be. Normally, he wouldn\u2019t be able to tell, but once he got angry, he wouldn\u2019t be able to breathe.</p><br/><p>\u201cYour Majesty, please calm your anger. Your Majesty, please calm your anger \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu knew that this was not the right time to come and his tone was flat, he was not alarmed nor afraid, \u201cReporting to father, since you have already made second brother your king, then I will wholeheartedly support second brother. I do not dare to have any second thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yun knelt at the side and hesitated for a long time, \u201cThis son also does not dare to have any second thoughts.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Emperor Yuan Hui puffed his beard and glared as he snorted coldly: \u201cNow that you\u2019ve said it in such a nice way, who knows what kind of actions you\u2019re going to take behind my back!\u201d</p><br/><p>The two of them said nothing.</p><br/><p>Seeing them, Emperor Yuan Hui was annoyed, he waved his hands and ordered them to leave, \u201cThese past two months, all of you have been staying in your own residences, you are not allowed to go anywhere. If anyone does not obey, we will strip them of their title as princes, and let them have a taste of being commoners!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu and Yan Yun answered yes in unison as they left the Palace Xuanshi.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Neither Yan Yu nor Yan Yun spoke a word first as they rode side by side on the road out of the palace.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu received an unsigned letter. When he saw the contents of the letter, he was shocked, hence he secretly asked Wu Ze and Wu Bin to investigate. Yan Yun had interacted with the great general of Western Yi multiple times just to meet him at the first rank city building. Yan Yu told Wu Ze to spend a lot of money to bribe the waiter of the restaurant, and he told him everything that he knew.</p><br/><p>He had thought that he would be able to take advantage of the recent news and hand it over to the Emperor Yuan Hui, which would be able to topple the level king in one fell swoop. Now, not only did Emperor Yuan Hui not believe either of them, he had even imprisoned them for two months.</p><br/><p>Just as Yan Yu was thinking this, Yan Yun, who had fallen behind, suddenly increased his speed and stood in front of him. Hawkeye stared at him, asking, \u201cIs the assassin who tried to assassinate this king really not Sixth Brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu walked past him. Although normally he was quiet, but at critical moments he could make people choke their pants, \u201cIs Big Brother worth it for me to be so reckless?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yun did not get angry, but laughed out loud, \u201cThis king only thinks that it\u2019s rare, I never thought that Sixth Brother would actually be so tolerant. If it was me, I would surely take revenge for murdering my father and mother, no? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu clenched his reins tightly, his jaw becoming taut.</p><br/><p>As if he did not realize it, he continued to provoke him, \u201cOr maybe Sixth Brother never treated them as his parents. Although they are not his own parents, they raised you for seven to eight years no matter what \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s eyes were bloodshot, and he was biting so hard that his teeth were about to break.</p><br/><p>The reins were firmly in his hands, and veins popped on the back of his hands. He finally closed his eyes, and only after a long time did his heaving chest calm down. His tone was cold. \u201cBig Brother finally admits that you\u2019re the one who did it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yun followed behind her with an extremely presumptuous smile, \u201cSo what if this king admits it? Do you have any proof? For two people who are not related in any way, how can you cut off your own brother? \u201d</p><br/><p>The First Prince and Second Prince were at loggerheads, so the First Prince naturally did not wish for another person to contend for the throne. That was why after he received the news, he immediately sent out guards to take Yan Yu\u2019s life outside the palace without anyone knowing.</p><br/><p>It was just that he did not expect Yan Yu\u2019s adoptive parents to be so persistent, even if he was going to die, he wanted to protect Yan Yu.</p><br/><p>The guards finally killed them both.</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to finish Yan Yu off, the people from Emperor Yuan Hui and the Second Prince came over.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the Madame Song and Li Xiqing had already stopped breathing.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu straightened his back, the scene of his parents dying once again appeared in his mind. He was no longer the young man whose mind had been muddled by hatred back then.</p><br/><p>At that time, he had just entered the palace and found out that it was the First Prince\u2019s men who had killed his parents. They had attempted to avenge his parents time and time again, but had almost died at the hands of the First Prince time and time again. If not for the protection of Crown Prince Yan Tao, he might not have lived past today.</p><br/><p>Now that his wings had grown, he slowly learned how to hide his emotions.</p><br/><p>Wait, wait.</p><br/><p>He told himself that sooner or later he would have to avenge his parents and take Yan Yun\u2019s head off.</p><br/><p>He waited for eight years, and very quickly, he reached the end.</p><br/><p>He walked in front and said in a neither humble nor haughty manner, \u201cBig Brother was born from the former Empress, and I was born from the imperial concubine Hui. You and I can\u2019t be considered our biological parents.\u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, it wasn\u2019t a big deal to lose decorum, continuing to maintain this hypocritical brotherly relationship instead made him feel disgusted.</p><br/><p>Yan Yun watched as he walked further and further away, the smile on his face slowly disappearing. In the end, he put on a gloomy face and stared at his back.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Before Yan Yu even returned to the An Wang\u2019s Mansion, it was already raining outside.</p><br/><p>The rain was especially heavy this summer. Every two or three days, there would be a downpour, and each time, it would stop shortly after. At first, Xie Zhen did not mind sitting in his room, but two hours later, the rain still did not stop. Furthermore, the sky outside was getting darker, and Yan Yu had not returned even after entering the palace for four to six hours.</p><br/><p>She could not help but worry, and walked back and forth in the house, letting Shuang Yu go to the door to see if there were any horses for Yan Yu.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu returned and shook his head: \u201cI can\u2019t see An Wang Lord.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen asked her what time it was, and she replied him: \u201cAt that time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although it was not late, because of the rain, it was no different from the evening.</p><br/><p>The rain fell on the the Gallery veranda, making a loud sound, as if beads of various sizes were falling on a jade plate. Xie Zhen was worried that something would happen to Yan Yu on the way, so he sent the servant s of the Palace out to look for him. servant searched along the road from the An Wang\u2019s Mansion to the palace gates, but he couldn\u2019t find Yan Yu\u2019s figure.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen became more and more worried. Why was he not back yet? Where did he go?</p><br/><p>Since she couldn\u2019t sit still in the house, she might as well hold up her umbrella and go outside to search. Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan tried to persuade her again and again, but in the end, they couldn\u2019t persuade her. In the journey from the Zhanyue Court to the entrance, there was a lot of water that accumulated, wetting her shoes and socks.</p><br/><p>She walked forward a distance and suddenly saw someone riding a horse towards her. She recognized the person almost immediately and shouted happily, \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s clothes were drenched from the rain, and stuck to his chest. He stopped his horse in front of her and dismounted, \u201cWhy are you out here?\u201d</p><br/><p>She raised the umbrella to his head. \u201cYou\u2019ve been gone so long, but you\u2019re not coming back yet. I was worried that something might have happened to you \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>A few drops of rain dripped from her pale cheeks, her hair stuck to her cheeks, and her eyes were clear and bright as if they had been washed by the rain. At this moment, there was a smile on her face as she obediently held the umbrella to protect him from the wind and the rain. Her small hand slipped into his sleeve to hold his hand. Let\u2019s hurry back. \u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he finished, he was pulled into Yan Yu\u2019s embrace.</p><br/><p>She was startled, then turned to look at him. \u201cWhat happened to Big Brother Xiao Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu also didn\u2019t know what was wrong with him. He just wanted to hug her so much that he could pull her small body into his arms and fill up his empty space.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cLet me hold him for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen made a sound as he found it difficult to reply, \u201cBut it\u2019s raining outside \u2026.\u201d</p><br/><p>He insisted, \u201cJust for a moment.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 \u201cAlright then.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen held the umbrella in one hand and grabbed onto the clothes on his back with the other. Not long later, he started to complain, \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu, my hands are sore \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Always so spoiled.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu turned his head and gently bit her face. In the end, he released her and took the umbrella from her hands, returning back to An Wang\u2019s Mansion with her.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Both of their clothes were drenched, especially Yan Yu, who was so strong that his entire body was drenched.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu took out some clothes from the house. Originally, he wanted to help the two of them change, but Yan Yu said that it was not necessary.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen changed into a new set of clothes. Above them was a white silk dress and below it was a delicate green satin dress, making her look like a sprout that was tender and tender. She took the handkerchief from the servant maids and wiped Yan Yu\u2019s face and hands, asking, \u201cWhere did you go just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>The rain outside was still pouring down, but a gentle breeze blew the raindrops into the in the porch. The rain fell onto the in the porch, drying and leaving mottled marks.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu sat on the Eight Immortals\u2019 chair, his eyelids drooping slightly. After a moment of silence, he said: \u201cI went to the Mountain Qingyao outside the city.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Mountain Qingyao was the place where the husband and wife of the Madam Li were buried.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s movements slightly paused, he looked at his expression carefully: \u201cWhy do you think you want to go there? It\u2019s raining so heavily outside, what should we do if something happens? \u201d</p><br/><p>He did not make a sound.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen washed the towel at the side, and continued to wipe his hands, \u201cIf you want to go next time, you can have me accompany you.\u201d</p><br/><p>He looked at her and grunted.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen felt that he was in a bad mood, but she did not force anything out of him. When he wanted to say it himself, he would say it. His entire body was burning like a fireball, but his hands and feet were wrapped around Xie Zhen, hugging her tightly in his embrace, making her unable to even move, and he could only call servant maids for a doctor.</p><br/><p>After the doctor saw it, he said it was a cold that caused the wind, took a pill, and sweated it off.</p><br/><p>After Xie Zhen fed him the medicine, she took out two quilts and spread it on his body. She originally wanted to sleep in concubine tonight, but she didn\u2019t expect that he would hold her hand tightly and not let her go.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had no choice but to kick off his embroidered shoes and sleep on the bed with him.</p><br/><p>But he was too hot, and it was summer, though it had rained, and the two quilts were very hot. In a short while, Xie Zhen was sweating profusely, but on the other hand, he was sleeping soundly. He put his arms around her waist, and there was no gap between them. She moaned, \u201cIt\u2019s hot, don\u2019t move.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t hear it when he fell asleep.</p><br/><p>By the morning of the second day, Xie Zhen was awoken by the heat.</p><br/><p>The moment she opened her eyes, she was met with Yan Yu\u2019s pitch black eyes.</p><br/><p>When did he wake up?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen subconsciously touched his forehead and heaved a sigh of relief, \u201cAt least it\u2019s not hot anymore.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she got out from under the blanket. She had to take a bath first \u2026 His body was covered with sweat, and he didn\u2019t know how he fell asleep last night. However, the moment she moved, she was immediately pressed down by Yan Yu. She held her breath, and even though he was a patient, he was still very heavy! She protested, \u201cBrother Xiao Yu get up, I\u2019ll get the servant maids to give you medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not move, and instead rubbed his hands against her neck in silence, his voice hoarse. \u201cLittle Lamb \u2026 Please stay with me for a while. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stuck her face to the pillow, and turned her head to look at him in puzzlement: \u201cDidn\u2019t I always accompany you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He placed his hand on her waist, stroking her smooth skin back and forth. In the future, you must also accompany me. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen felt that it was strange, why did he say this for no reason? But seeing that he was serious, he agreed. \u201cOkay, okay. Can you let me go first?\u201d</p><br/><p>He held her tighter. \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Like a grumpy child.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was both amused and helpless at the same time. His intelligent eyes moved about, \u201cThen you aren\u2019t taking any medicine today? No more beds? Are you going to hug me like this from now on? \u201d</p><br/><p>He thought for a moment. \u201cI can hug you every day for at least the next two months.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen sensed something strange from his words and turned around, staring straight at him. \u201cDid His Majesty say anything when you entered the palace yesterday?\u201d</p><br/><p>He replied in an indifferent manner: \u201cfather restricted my Peace King for two months.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was startled, why was it related to Ping Wang as well?</p><br/><p>She tilted her head. \u201cYou entered the palace with the Prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>He said no, so he told her everything that happened after they entered Palace Xuanshi yesterday. It was only then that she suddenly realized. If you enter the palace together with the Peace King, he will inevitably believe either of you. \u201d Pausing, she comforted him: \u201cWhat\u2019s there to be sad about? If you\u2019re grounded for two months, you\u2019ll be on leave. \u201d</p><br/><p>She watched very openly, Yan Yu laughed because of her relaxed tone.</p><br/><p>He leaned against her cheek and whispered in her ear, \u201cThat\u2019s not it.\u201d</p><br/><p>She pursed her lips. \u201cWhy is that?\u201d</p><br/><p>After pausing for a long while, Yan Yu finally told her the whole story, \u201cDo you remember when we were killed in Puning Temple?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought for a long time before he finally remembered.</p><br/><p>At that time, the Xie Clan, Li Clan and Gao Clan went to the Puning Temple together to burn incense while Xie Zhen and Yan Yu were kidnapped by the black-clothed man. At that time, the two of them were only seven years old. She had forgotten how they had escaped, only that they had come to a house and been taken in for the night by a kind couple.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said: \u201cI remember.\u201d</p><br/><p>Among the two men in black, one of them was Yan Tao.</p><br/><p>The other was the older brother of the former Queen, Ji Ming.</p><br/><p>At that time, Empress Ji had not yet passed away, but her life was not long. She was afraid that after she died, the Emperor Yuan Hui would establish the imperial concubine Hui and take Yan Yu back as Crown Prince.</p><br/><p>Not only that, even the matter of Yan Yu and Yan Yao\u2019an stealing dragons for phoenixes was done by Empress Ji.</p><br/><p>At that time, the Crown Prince was the First Prince, Yan Yun.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao needed a person to link their hands together to stop the First Prince, which was why he could save Yan Yu from Ji Ming.</p><br/><p>After Empress Ji passed away, the Emperor Yuan Hui found out where Yan Yu was.</p><br/><p>That was why Yan Yun wanted to kill him.</p><br/><p>It was just that he did not expect the Madam Li Couple to protect him at all costs.</p><br/><p>Even if Yan Yu found out afterwards, Yan Yun still wouldn\u2019t mind. He could easily lie to everyone, and say that Madam Li and his wife disagreed with him bringing Yan Yu back to the palace.</p><br/><p>Yan Yun only needed to punish the guard who attacked him.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen finally understood how Auntie Song died after listening to his explanation of all these \u2026 She blinked, trying to blink away the bitterness in her eyes. In the end, both her eyes were red.</p><br/><p>She hugged Yan Yu\u2019s neck and thought about it for a long time, but didn\u2019t know how to comfort him. Finally, she rubbed against his chest and said softly, \u201cCan I sing a song for you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He touched her head. \u201cSing what?\u201d</p><br/><p>She could sing a lot of songs and play the flute, but she hadn\u2019t had a chance to be married to him for so long. And he loved it when she sang that nursery rhyme, so she sang it to him every time.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought for a while, then cupped his hands in his embrace and cleared his throat as he started to sing, \u201cCanglang\u2019s water is clear and beautiful, you can tame me \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The melodious melody of the song came out from his arms.</p><br/><p>It was originally a grand and magnificent song, but now she began to sing it in a melodious and melodious manner.</p><br/><p>Her voice was long and soft, pleasant and pleasant to the ear. \u201cWaves of turbid water, can make my feet \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After a while, when she heard no response, she looked up and asked, \u201cDid you hear it?\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded. \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen why didn\u2019t you praise me?\u201d</p><br/><p>All of his worries were swept away as all he could think of was her singing. He leaned over and looked at her round eyes: \u201cLittle Lamb, are you my Canglang Water?\u201d</p><br/><p>She giggled, neither admitting nor denying.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p><br/><p>Chapter error, this report (no registration) will be processed within 5 minutes.

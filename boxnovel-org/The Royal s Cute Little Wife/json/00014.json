He frowned and asked, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to wait in the main hall, but the maid took him out into the backyard. Shuang Yu said she was here, and he followed her here, and from a distance he saw her with her ear to the door, and he did not know what she was eavesdropping on.</p><br/><p>This was the first time he took the initiative to look for her, and Xie Zhen was very surprised. She went up and grabbed his hand to walk back, \u201cCome and help me listen. What happened to my mother and father?\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Shuang Yu really let them hear them in the corner? If the old master and madam were to know, would she still be alive? She hurriedly stopped them at the door with a flushed face and tried to coax them, \u201cMiss, don\u2019t worry. Master and Madam are fine \u2026\u201d \u201cSince Young Master Li has come to find you, why don\u2019t I take you to another room to take a seat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre they really all right?\u201d Xie Zhen asked curiously.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu, after all, is an innocent girl. Knowing that master and madam was in love in the house, she was naturally embarrassed to stand too close to her, so she went around nearby for a while. She didn\u2019t expect that she would actually let this girl in and cause a lot of trouble for herself. She hurriedly nodded, \u201cI\u2019m really alright.\u201d</p><br/><p>She managed to coax the two away, and before she left, he muttered, \u201cBut I heard something.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu turned around and asked, \u201cWhat did you hear?\u201d</p><br/><p>When she thought of the pleasant, painful voice of her mother, she repeat it to him innocently, \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu hurriedly covered her mouth in fright. Little mistress, is this something you can say!?</p><br/><p>If she still remembered this scene when she grew up in the future, wouldn\u2019t she regret it?</p><br/><p>Fortunately, Li Yu was also a child, so he didn\u2019t understand what Xie Zhen meant. The two of them quickly opened the page and returned to the yard where the snowman had been sitting. The snowmen were still there, but Xie Xun was nowhere to be seen. Xie Rong was the only one left in the yard, rubbing the snowballs.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Ah Xun, brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong put the snowball aside and stood up to brush off the snow on his shoulders. He then looked behind her with a smile.</p><br/><p>The next moment, Xie Zhen felt a chill on her neck and a snowball hit her.</p><br/><p>She clutched her neck as she turned around, and sure enough, Xie Xun was wrapped in a red cotton-padded jacket. She was standing under the cedar tree, smirking. \u201cSister, you idiot!\u201d</p><br/><p>This little bastard actually dared to bully her? She tried to look angry, but she couldn\u2019t hold back a grin. She bent down, picked up her snowball, and threw it in the direction she was standing. The snowball landed on Xie Xun\u2019s satin boots, and she screamed as she dodged to the side. When she got to her feet, she crouched down and rubbed a small snowball. She threw it with a wave of her hand, just in time to land on Xie Rong, who was behind Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>She immediately stood properly and admitted her mistake, \u201cBig brother, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he said that, she went back to rubbing the snowball and messed up with Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xie Rong wouldn\u2019t really get angry with them. The two of them threw snowballs to each other, while he made snowballs for them under the tree, laughing as he watched them play.</p><br/><p>Li Yu came here for talking to Xie Zhen, but she actually started to play and made him waiting for a while. In the end, he was so unlucky that he was hit by Xie Zhen\u2019s snowball.</p><br/><p>He only saw a flash in front of his eyes, wiped his face, and saw a sly smile on Xie Zhen\u2019s face, \u201cBrother Xiao Yu, are you alright? Why don\u2019t you dodge? \u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to hide, but she had thrown it in front of him. Where could he hide?</p><br/><p>It was obviously she threw to him on purpose!</p><br/><p>Li Yu countered bluntly. Unfortunately, Xie Zhen\u2019s body was too agile, like a small fish, and he couldn\u2019t hit Li Yu. In the end, the two sisters worked together to deal with him. One was in the front and the other was behind, forcing him into a dead end.</p><br/><p>Li Yu glowered at her: \u201cXie Zhen!\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the first time he called her by her name.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201dXie Zhen blinked her watery eyes.</p><br/><p>Even if she pretended to be innocent, he wouldn\u2019t let her off!</p><br/><p>Li Yu jumped up and threw himself on top of her without any warning. He held her shoulders tightly, stared at her for a long time, then suddenly bent his head and bit into her apple red and white cheeks. Her skin was very smooth. Li Yu bit into it a few times but didn\u2019t manage to bite it. Just as he was about to exert more force, she let out a soft and thin groan. It was like a kitten.</p><br/><p>Li Yu immediately stopped. He didn\u2019t know what was going on, but he was a little reluctant to take the bait.</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t been able to control his strength a few times when he bit her, and her tongue was wet and tickling against her cheek, and it hurt a little with his teeth clattering. Xie Zhen was unable to breathe due to his pressure. Her eyes were filled with a pool of water. His pink lips slightly opened in astonishment and resistance, \u201cBig brother Xiao Yu is so heavy \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu\u2019s spirits were lifted. She stood up abruptly and patted the snow off his body: \u201cYou were heavy when I carried you last time.\u201d</p><br/><p>With two teeth marks and a face full of saliva, she sat up and wiped it with her sleeve. She couldn\u2019t help but feel disgusted. \u201cIt\u2019s so dirty.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu\u2019s face turned greener. \u201cIt\u2019s not dirty at all.\u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl was the cleanest. Although she liked big brother Xiao Yu, that didn\u2019t mean she could be bitten on the face by him. She wiped her mouth with the sleeve of her dress carefully, then stood up and ran back to her room.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere are the you going?\u201d asked Shuang Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m going to wash my face!\u201d she said from a distance.</p><br/><p>Li Yu pursed his lips in displeasure.</p><br/><p>When she was finally finished washing her face, Shuang Yu combed her hair again, wrapping two thin beads of gold with little bells hanging on either end of the chain. The bells clanged as they walked.</p><br/><p>The house was burning with charcoal, and the room was warm and completely different from the world outside. He took off his brocade peony brocade coat. Inside, he wore only a red jacket and a slant and half an arm, and he ran around the room in soft boots. Fearing that she might catch a cold, Shuang Yu forced her to put on the coat, but she refused to listen.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen walked up to Li Yu with great interest, he had long forgotten about the displeasure from before, \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu, what do you want?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu also felt that she wore too little. She was clearly more delicate than others, and she often fell ill with fever. Why didn\u2019t she take good care of herself? However, he didn\u2019t want to be nosy. He let the maidservants from the Li Residence in and took a box of rosewood from her hands and placed it on the table. \u201cLast time, I broke your hairpin. I said I would compensate you with one.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he opened the box, she saw her hairpin.</p><br/><p>She shouted, \u201cWhere did you buy it, big brother Xiaoyu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu said that he didn\u2019t buy it. He pointed to the gold inlaid circle in the middle of the hairpin, \u201cThis is the one you bought last time. I got someone to fix it up.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as he said it, Xie Zhen realized it was true. The indirection of the gold was engraved with ripples of water, perfectly natural and unobtrusive. Xie Zhen held the hairpin and looked around, admiring Li Yu, feeling guilty about throwing the snowball at him.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, what was more guilty was, that Li Yu took out a longevity lock from his pocket, it was exactly the one Xie Zhen was in the jewelry store with.</p><br/><p>He said, \u201cIs this lock yours? I\u2019ve got it back.\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course he wouldn\u2019t tell her that he\u2019d sent someone to get it back. He just felt that this lock was pretty, so it was a pity that it could be casually given to others.</p><br/><p>His thoughts were the same as Leng Ning\u2019s. Ever since Madam Leng found out that Xie Zhen had given the longevity lock with silver-dotted blue cloud to the jewelry store owner, she had not only mentioned her name once. She put it on his neck happily and said, \u201cThank you, Brother Xiaoyu!\u201d</p><br/><p>When she saw the sweat on Li Yu\u2019s face, she asked doubtfully, \u201cAre you hot?\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head.</p><br/><p>She learned later that it was water after the snow had melted. The snowflake on his face was roasted by the heat of the room and quickly melted, turning into droplets of water that dripped down.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu had borrowed Xie Rong\u2019s clothes to get him to change, but he refused to do anything.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen took out her soft silk handkerchief, stood in front of him, and began to carefully wipe the water drops off his face. \u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d she said in a somewhat fawning tone.</p><br/><p>Li Yu didn\u2019t say anything and apparently didn\u2019t accept her apology.</p><br/><p>She rubbed harder, her small, pretty face almost touching his, her long, raised eyelashes quivering slightly as they brushed against the bridge of his nose. She said, \u201cBrother Xiaoyu bit me just now, but I wasn\u2019t angry.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu said, \u201cBecause you deserve it.\u201d</p><br/><p>And why wasn\u2019t she angry? She hated him for being dirty. Li Yu thought.</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t been entrusted by his parents, he wouldn\u2019t have come at all \u2026 Remembering Li Xiqing and Lady Song, Li Yu finally remembered the main purpose of his visit today. \u201cNext month, my family is going to burn incense at the Puyin Temple, and there\u2019s a forest of peaches at the back of the mountain. Mother asked me to ask you two, do you want to go see the peach blossoms together?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes!\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu couldn\u2019t help but try to calm her down. \u201cYou\u2019d better go ask Aunt Leng first.\u201d</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t seem to be losing interest in the matter. She gave a cheerful grunt of acknowledgment. Wiping the water from his face and neck, and then standing him in front of the fire for a long time, they would let him go home.</p><br/><p>After Li Yu left, Xie Zhen immediately ran to the main house to find Leng.</p><br/><p>At this moment, the door was open. Madam Leng sat in front of the mirror, while Xie Liqing was behind her, brushing her hair.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen ran to her, and said, \u201cmother, mother, I have something to show you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng looked no different from her usual self, but her eyes were full of happiness, adding a few traces of beauty to them. Not only did her cold temperament not clash with them, it was also a perfect match.</p><br/><p>She asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><br/><p>As if offering a gift, she held the hairpin in front of her and asked expectantly, \u201cIs it exactly the same as the hairpin of mother? I bought this for you last time, but unfortunately it broke later on. Brother Xiao Yu picked it up again. Isn\u2019t he very good\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The little girl kept blabbering, but Madam Leng listened patiently.</p><br/><p>She smiled. \u201cVery powerful.\u201d</p><br/><p>She pointed to the longevity lock on his neck. \u201cBrother Xiaoyu also found this for me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her tone was extremely proud.</p><br/><p>Seeing that Leng was smiling, Xie Zhen told her the purpose of Li Yu\u2019s visit today. After listening, she agreed without any hesitation, \u201cI\u2019ve been in Qingzhou for so long, I didn\u2019t take a good look around. I took advantage of this opportunity to take you out for a walk.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was happy and shouted. The bell on her head of the flower chimes up and down, making a clear and melodious sound.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

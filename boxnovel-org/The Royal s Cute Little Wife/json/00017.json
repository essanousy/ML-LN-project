She walked around the screen and looked inside, but there was no sign of Xie Zhen and Li Yu!</p><br/><p>Panicking, she searched the room inside and outside, but she couldn\u2019t find Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>How was this possible, she had seen the second miss enter the room just now? How come she disappeared in the blink of an eye! Only now did she notice that the bed was a little messy and the window was slightly open. It was obvious that someone had just left.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu hurried out of the room and chased after him. \u201cSecond Miss, Young Master Li!\u201d</p><br/><p>The people in the temple were all busy fighting the fire, so no one noticed her situation. She didn\u2019t dare to delay any further and hurriedly ran to the front to notify Xie Liqing and Madam Leng.</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, it was already too late. Xie Zhen and Li Yu had already been taken away.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was carried on someone else\u2019s shoulder, a rag stuck in her mouth, and she couldn\u2019t even scream. The man who carried her walked on the rough mountain road, making her stomach hurt. She was clearly extremely afraid, but she didn\u2019t dare to cry out. She was afraid that if she made a sound, the other party would kill her.</p><br/><p>Just now, she had gone to Li Yu\u2019s room to look for him. As soon as she entered the room, before she could see what was going on inside, a hand had covered her from behind.</p><br/><p>The hand was rough and dry with a thick cocoon on it. It was obviously not Li Yu\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>She was about to struggle when she saw another person pick up Li Yu and glare at her fiercely, \u201cIf you dare to shout, I\u2019ll kill you.\u201d</p><br/><p>The fair of eyes were so sharp and fierce that she immediately shut her mouth in fear.</p><br/><p>Li Yu had not expected her to come. He was calmer than she was, but he was still a child after all. He couldn\u2019t help but yell at her: \u201cWhy are you standing there? Why don\u2019t you run?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without any hesitation, Xie Zhen broke away from the hand and turned to run.</p><br/><p>She thought that if she ran away, she could find her parents to save big brother Xiao Yu. She didn\u2019t want to die here.</p><br/><p>But before she reached the door, the person carrying Li Yu regretted it. He raised his chin towards his partner and said, \u201cBring her with you, and we\u2019ll settle it together.\u201d</p><br/><p>The two people carrying them were both dressed in black with their faces covered. Their facial features could not be seen clearly, and one could only tell that they were martial artists that they were not weak. They each carried a child to the halfway point of the mountain. Originally, they wanted to resolve this problem on the spot, but they felt that they were too close to the temple and could easily be seen through.</p><br/><p>They nearly bounced out Xie Zhen\u2019s breakfast and lunch out of her stomach before they stopped and threw her and Li Yu to the ground.</p><br/><p>The back of her head hit the trunk of the tree, and her upper and lower teeth caught her tongue, and the pain made her tear up.</p><br/><p>She sobbed and forced herself not to cry as she subconsciously reached out to grab Li Yu.</p><br/><p>Li Yu was slightly better off than her. At least he wasn\u2019t injured. He quickly got up and stood in front of her. He lifted his delicate eyebrows and looked at the two men in black, \u201cWho are you two? What are you going to do?\u201d</p><br/><p>He hadn\u2019t looked closely just now, but now he caught a glimpse of the sunlight. This brat really did look similar \u2026 The one in the Forbidden City \u2026</p><br/><p>Even though he was still young, he could already see the outline between his eyebrows. As for his overbearing attitude, ordinary children would never be able to learn it.</p><br/><p>No wonder someone had tried to get rid of him.</p><br/><p>One of the burly men in black grabbed him by the arm and lifted him up. Did I bring you here to drink tea? \u201d</p><br/><p>As he said this, he took out his sabre from his waist, the cold blade edge reflecting a dazzling light under the sunlight. The light pierced into Li Yu\u2019s eyes, causing him to subconsciously close his eyes, and then he felt a chill on his face. When he opened his eyes, the blade slid down his cheek all the way to his chest.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the man in black was about to stab into Li Yu\u2019s chest, Xie Zhen hurriedly shouted, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>After saying that, she got up from the ground and stumbled over to the man in black. Holding onto his leg, she lifted up her delicate and innocent face, which had two pairs of watery eyes like black grapes. With tears in her eyes, she pleaded, \u201cDon\u2019t kill Brother Xiaoyu, I beg you, don\u2019t kill him \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The black clothed person had never seen such a cute girl before. Regardless of whether it was the daughter of a famous clan or the princess, there was never a person who was so lovable. He was stunned for a moment before recovering and kicking her aside. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the next one will be you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Originally, they didn\u2019t intend to kill her, but she had broken their action, so when she went back, she would definitely say something that she shouldn\u2019t say to others. In order to reduce the trouble, it was better to silence her immediately.</p><br/><p>Li Yu\u2019s shoulder was in so much pain from being grabbed that it seemed as if his bones were about to break. He clenched his teeth and said, \u201cYou dare \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>You dare to touch one of her fingers.</p><br/><p>At this time, he was still young and did not know the meaning of the second half of the sentence. He only felt angry. He was angry because he was somehow implicated, because she was injured because of him.</p><br/><p>The man in black sneered. He probably thought that it was laughable to be threatened by a child, and didn\u2019t even bother to explain himself.</p><br/><p>The sword cut through his clothes and stabbed into his chest.</p><br/><p>Li Yu frowned and asked, \u201cWhy did you kill us?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man might think he was dying, or he might think he was talking to a child, but he didn\u2019t understand. \u201cWhy? There\u2019s no such thing as\u2019 why \u2018. If someone wants you to die, you can\u2019t live on!\u201d</p><br/><p>He stabbed the blade deeper as he spoke.</p><br/><p>Li Yu clenched his teeth in pain. The feeling of his flesh being cut was exceptionally clear. In the end, he couldn\u2019t help but let out a sorrowful cry.</p><br/><p>However, when he tried to pierce Li Yu\u2019s chest, he suddenly stopped. The man in black\u2019s eyes were wide open as he looked down at the long blade that suddenly appeared in his chest. Blood was dripping from the tip of the blade. It was coming out from his chest.</p><br/><p>It was another man in black.</p><br/><p>That person didn\u2019t pull out the blade. Instead, he grabbed the handle and spun it around. The pain immediately made the other party roll his eyes, release Li Yu, and fall to the side stiffly.</p><br/><p>The man opened his mask, revealing a cold and handsome face. The man opened his mask, revealing a cold and handsome face. He looked at the not completely dead black clothed person on the ground and gently opened his thin lips. He said, \u201cTo even chase and kill a child, she truly has a venomous heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>The man in black stared at his face. He wanted to say something, but was unable to. In the end, he rolled his eyes and died.</p><br/><p>Both Xie Zhen and Li Yu were pampered little ancestors, so they were stunned when they saw such a bloody scene. Xie Zhen, in particular, stared dumbly at the man who made his move and asked, \u201cWhy did you kill him? Aren\u2019t you guys on the same side? Did you betray him?\u201d</p><br/><p>The man drew out his sword and handed it to the others who appeared behind him. \u201cWe are not in the same group.\u201d</p><br/><p>Waves of guards rushed out of the forest and knelt respectfully behind him. Who was he?</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you\u2019re going to let us go?\u201d Xie Zhen asked in a low and frightened voice.</p><br/><p>The person actually nodded. His expression didn\u2019t change. Instead, he spoke with a hint of mercy, \u201cGo as far away as possible from the capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>At a time like this, even if Xie Zhen didn\u2019t understand what he had said she was going to nod and say, \u201cUh-huh, we\u2019ll go!\u201d</p><br/><p>That person took another deep glance in this direction, his gaze landing on Li Yu\u2019s face. His expression changed unnoticeably, and he quickly regained his calm expression. He then turned around and led the group of people away.</p><br/><p>Li Yu\u2019s chest had a hole pierced through. Although it wasn\u2019t deep, it was still a wound that was constantly bleeding.</p><br/><p>There were only the two of them in the wilderness, and for a moment, Xie Zhen felt as helpless and lonely as ever. Facing the injured Li Yu, she didn\u2019t know how to save him.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen folded his hands and covered his injured area, \u201cBig brother Xiao Yu, will you die? Don\u2019t die, I\u2019ll take you back to Auntie Song.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu couldn\u2019t help but cough. This movement involved a wound to his chest, causing him to grimace in pain. His earlier calmness was long gone.</p><br/><p>Sweat appeared on his forehead, probably due to his earlier fear.</p><br/><p>Poor Xie Zhen had been terrified. They didn\u2019t know where they were being taken, but they had the feeling that they were going so far that they couldn\u2019t even see the temple. The sun was about to set, and if they didn\u2019t get back to the temple soon, they would be eaten by the wolves and tigers.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Xiaoyu, get up. Let\u2019s go back quickly \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu nodded and followed behind her, clutching his chest.</p><br/><p>There were weeds on both sides of the road. Some were even half the height of a human, making walking very difficult. Moreover, the mountain was not yet civilized, and the road was full of gravel. It was very difficult to walk on it.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen held Li Yu\u2019s hand and walked for a while. She felt that it was harder and harder for her to drag Li Yu, until she couldn\u2019t drag him any longer. She turned around and saw Li Yu lying on the ground, unmoving. The weeds on both sides of the road were almost dripping with his blood.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Xiaoyu!\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you dead?\u201d She screamed, fearing he would die just like the man in black. She shook his arm in panic. \u201cSay something!\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long while, Li Yu let out a slow breath and said leisurely, \u201cHow can I talk to you if I\u2019m dead \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou won\u2019t die.\u201d she muttered, as tears trickled down her face.</p><br/><p>Li Yu nodded.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t want to die here.</p><br/><p>This time he could not move, and Xie Zhen could not bear to leave him behind. She put his arm around her shoulders and dragged him forward.</p><br/><p>He was taller than she was, so it wasn\u2019t hard to help him up. But as time went on, she got tired.</p><br/><p>No matter how good the children\u2019s feet were, they wouldn\u2019t be able to get out of the mountain tonight. Not long after Xie Zhen helped Li Yu to walk, the sun went down. The forest was quickly enveloped by a layer of darkness. It was pitch black all around, and only a bit of light remained on the horizon.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was panicked and kept asking Li Yu, \u201cWhat should we do? What should we do?\u201d</p><br/><p>At this moment, the wound on Li Yu\u2019s chest had already solidified and was no longer bleeding. Moreover, he was numb from the pain, so he could no longer feel any pain. He was about to say something when he heard a wolf\u2019s howl in the far valley.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

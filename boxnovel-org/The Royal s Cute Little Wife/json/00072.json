Because the driver was in a hurry, driving hour was shortened by half.</p><br/><p>After getting off the carriage, the steward led Yan Yu and Xie Zhen to the Pavilion Changqing, \u201cYour Highness and the Empress please come with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Not long after they entered the courtyard, a person arrived on horseback, barely stopping at the entrance of the mansion.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun dismounted from his horse and stopped a servant to ask, \u201cI was the old friend of sixth prince, and we met by chance just now. But he just left in a hurry before we could even say a few words. May I ask if anything happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant, a porter at the gate, put his hands in his sleeves and looked him up and down, and seeing that he did not seem to be lying, said: \u201cThere is indeed something wrong.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a mother and a daughter coming into the mansion for no apparent reason. Since the sixth prince did not hide their identities, all the servants knew that they were the sixth prince\u2019s aunt and cousin when he was in exile.</p><br/><p>However, no one really liked them. They ate and drank in the mansion, and even ordered them about as well as shout at them.</p><br/><p>It was their duty to serve, but that cousin lady was truly a bit too impolite. She treated herself as if she were the master of sixth prince\u2019s mansion.</p><br/><p>After all, the masters in the sixth prince\u2019s Mansion were only the sixth prince and the Prince\u2019s wife.</p><br/><p>The servants were secretly discussing about them, guessing what kind of scheme she and Madam Li had, and how long they would stay here.</p><br/><p>If they really planned to stay here permanently, could the Prince\u2019s wife bear with it?</p><br/><p>Gao Xun was right. He brought the horse over and asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant glanced at the courtyard, covering his mouth with his hand as he said in a low voice, \u201cA few days ago, a mother and a daughter came to the mansion. It is said that they are His Highness\u2019s previous aunt and cousin.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThe aunt lady seemed to be dying, so the steward asked His Highness back to discuss the matter.\u201d</p><br/><p>Aunt?</p><br/><p>Cousin?</p><br/><p>Could it be what he thought it was?</p><br/><p>Gao Xun frowned and deliberately asked, \u201cHis Highness\u2019s mother is imperial concubine Hui, and imperial concubine Hui is the daughter of Minister Bai. How come I\u2019ve never heard of him having other daughters \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant revealed a \u201cyou don\u2019t know\u201d expression, and probably because he had been holding it in in his heart for a long time, he could casually catch a person and talk for a long time, \u201cHis Highness has been living in seclusion for a period of time, and these two were his relatives at that time \u2026</p><br/><p>\u201cNow they know that our prince has honorable identity, so they came.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019d say how shameless they are.\u201d He revealed a defiant expression.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince His Highness has no relationship with them, saving their lives is already merciful \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant on the other side were still chattering away, but Gao Xun had already fallen into a trance.</p><br/><p>The mother and the daughter pair mentioned by the servant were most likely Madam Li and Ouyang Yi.</p><br/><p>He had some impression of these two. Because of Ouyang Yi\u2019s domineering personality, he had a deep impression of her. At that time, she was living in the Li\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>Although she was obviously living under the protection of others, she did not comtrol herself, still being arrogant, so Li Yu rather disliked her.</p><br/><p>Who would have thought that after so many years, they would still have no change.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun nodded and looked deeply into the door. \u201cYou said just now that the aunt lady was dying?\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant was quick to talk, and after a while, he disclosed the whole story. \u201cYes. She fell on the edge of the well early in the morning, and she\u2019s almost dying.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun understood what had happened, and clasped his hands to the servant. \u201cThank you, little brother, for your explanation.\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he led the horse to the side. The servant held him back and reminded him worriedly, \u201cDon\u2019t say to others\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>However, when he turned around, the smile on his face immediately disappeared.</p><br/><p>He led his horse away, taking each step very slowly.</p><br/><p>Just as he approached the Pavilion Changqing, he heard the sound of crying coming from within.</p><br/><p>The mournful crying was nearly hoarse, causing people\u2019s hearts to tremble.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu and Xie Zhen walked into the yard. There were two servant maids standing in the yard. They were quite bewildered, but when they saw the two return, they came up to them as if they were their backbones.</p><br/><p>Liu Lan hurriedly said, \u201cYour Highness, esteemed princess, the aunt lady is dying!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he walked into the room, Yan Yu asked, \u201cHave you got the doctor to take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>Liu Lan nodded. \u201cYes. The doctor said that she is terminally ill and he has no way.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as they entered the room, a strong smell of medicine assaulted their nose. It was accompanied by a bad smell, causing them to frown.</p><br/><p>Liu Lan explained. \u201cThe aunt lady can\u2019t get out of bed these two days, so she ate and drank in bed all the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Since Yan Yu and Xie Zhen went to the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, Madame Li\u2019s condition became worse and worse. Her stomach hurt all night long, and sometimes she even vomited a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>Since the doctors had seen this, all of them could do nothing but shake their heads.</p><br/><p>She had been tormented by the pain for two days, and when she woke up this morning, her eyes were clear and her spirit was strong, so she personally went to the well to get water to wash her face. Unexpectedly, she couldn\u2019t keep her feet steady, and she stepped on empty air, heavily knocking her head against the stones by the well, and then she never got up again.</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi stayed by her side. She cried for an entire day, and her voice got hoarse from crying.</p><br/><p>All that was left was a low whimper. When the servant maids said that the sixth prince and the Prince\u2019s wife had arrived, the crying gradually became louder.</p><br/><p>It was dark inside the room. Ouyang Yi was guarding Madame Madam Li\u2019s bedside, hugging her as she called out to her mother. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Li was skinny on the bed. In just a few days, it seemed that there were only her bones remain. Her appearance was terrifying.</p><br/><p>Her eyes were half open, but still had a breath of air left. She slowly rolled her eyes to look at Yan Yu, as if she had noticed someone coming in.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was startled by Madam Li\u2019s appearance as soon as he entered. She had never seen a person on the verge of death before, so she stopped a few steps away, not daring to approach.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu stepped forward and called out, \u201cAunt.\u201d</p><br/><p>He paused and wanted to say something, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything else to say.</p><br/><p>When Ouyang Yi heard the voice, she turned around. Her face was covered in tears and her eyes were swollen like walnuts. \u201cCousin \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>This sound was filled with sorrow, and it lasted for a long time.</p><br/><p>She added, \u201cMother \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cMother is dying \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu looked at Madam Li expressionlessly.</p><br/><p>Madam Li was on the verge of death, but still knew it was him. She opened her mouth and called out, \u201cYu\u2019er.\u201d</p><br/><p>He lowered his eyes and said, \u201cI will get a doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then, he really called for Xiang Lan to come over. Just as he was about to speak, Madam Li shook her head. \u201cIt\u2019s useless \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI know my body well. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m at the end of my life, so I don\u2019t need to cause you any trouble \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He tilted his head to the side. Facing her death, even she was had never been close to him before, he still seemed to be touched a little.</p><br/><p>Madam Li always been weak and cowardly, and she had always lived under the shadow of her husband\u2019s family. She was used to being humble, and no matter who she spoke to, she was always humble.</p><br/><p>It was precisely someone like her who had given birth to such a domineering and arrogant daughter. With her personality, she would never be able to control Ouyang Yi and could only adopt a casual attitude.</p><br/><p>However, the more she let it go, the more undisciplined Ouyang Yi became. Only when she was about to die did she realize that she seemed to have done something wrong.</p><br/><p>She was worried about leaving her daughter alone.</p><br/><p>Madam Li stretched out her hand and with great difficulty grabbed Yan Yu\u2019s sleeve. With a weak breath, she said, \u201cThe only thing I am worried about is Ah Yi \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She gasped a few times with each sentence, speaking very slowly: \u201cIf I die, can you take care of her for a while and let her stay in the mansion \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, let her be your concubine \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s body stiffened and he frowned as he looked at her.</p><br/><p>Her eyes widened. She must have reached the end of her tether. \u201cYu\u2019er, can you \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu pursed his lips and didn\u2019t say anything.</p><br/><p>Madam Li cried. \u201cAunt begs you \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, he never said anything.</p><br/><p>In the next instant, Madame Li opened her eyes wide and no longer breathed, her hand still tightly grasping his sleeve.</p><br/><p>\u201cMother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Ouyang Yi rushed forward and cried out loud.</p><br/><p>The servant maids handed over the scissors, Yan Yu cut off half of the sleeve. He turned around and saw that Xie Zhen was no longer in the room.</p><br/><p>He was worried. Just as he was about to leave, he was stopped by Ouyang Yi. \u201cCousin, my mother has gone \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat should I do\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu thought of Madam Li\u2019s last words of entrustment, and he became frustrated. He coldly said, \u201cI will find a good husband for you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she saw that he was about to leave, she quickly stood in front of him, tears streaming down her face. \u201cMother gave me to you. She hasn\u2019t even been buried, yet you want to marry me off to someone else?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu stopped and looked at her with cold eyes, \u201cThen who do you want to marry?\u201d</p><br/><p>She wiped away her tears and blushed a little. \u201cMother wants me to be your concubine \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll do as she said.\u201d</p><br/><p>He clenched his teeth. There was no room for negotiation. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he waved her away and strode out. He said to steward Zhao at the entrance, \u201cI\u2019ll leave the responsibility of handling Aunt\u2019s funeral affairs to you. She\u2019ll be buried at the mountainside, buried with the people from the Li family.\u201d</p><br/><p>The steward answered, and was about to ask what wood was chosen for the coffin, when he looked up and saw that he had gone far away.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu went back. There was the only way back to Zhanyue Court, but he chased all the way until he saw no sign of Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>Even when he got to Zhanyue Court, he still didn\u2019t see her.</p><br/><p>He asked the servant maids where she was, and servant maids were all at a loss. \u201cPrincess has never been back.\u201d</p><br/><p>His heart was burning with anxiety, as he turned around and walked out.</p><br/><p>He searched the inside and outside of the residence but he couldn\u2019t find his wife.</p><br/><p>The servants did not know where Xie Zhen had gone, and all they knew was that the sixth prince was crazy. His face was full of anger, and it seemed that he was trying to dig up a hole in the ground to find the princess.</p><br/><p>The servants did not dare to act rashly. As it gradually darkened, they began to search the backyard with lanterns in hand.</p><br/><p>The servant guarding the door said that he hadn\u2019t seen the Prince\u2019s wife leave the mansion, so she should still be in the mansion.</p><br/><p>However, there were only a few places that the Prince\u2019s wife frequently visited. Where could she go?</p><br/><p>Steward Zhao anxiously said, \u201cPrincess, please don\u2019t do anything foolish \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>As sound of his voice faded, Yan Yu glanced at him and he immediately fell silent.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu suddenly thought of a place, and his heart suddenly ignited with hope. He grabbed the lantern in the servants\u2019 hands, threw the words \u201cdon\u2019t follow me\u201d, and quickly walked towards a small path.</p><br/><p>Steward Zhao was worried, so he followed him with two servants.</p><br/><p>He walked faster and faster until he stopped in front of a small courtyard on a cobblestone path.</p><br/><p>The night closed in all four directions, and it was not possible to see what was written on the courtyard\u2019s signboard. The sixth prince strode into the courtyard, and soon, he was submerged in the darkness of the night.</p><br/><p>Steward Zhao stopped outside the courtyard, unsure if he should enter.</p><br/><p>Finally, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s wait outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>The other two hurriedly agreed.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu walked into the yard and took a look at the surroundings with the lantern. It was very quiet and did not seem like there was anyone around.</p><br/><p>He did not give up and walked from the flower rack to the swing. Under the dim light of the lantern, he could barely see a person sitting on the swing.</p><br/><p>She held the rope gently in both hands, perhaps seeing him coming, but she did not speak or call to him, only tilted her head and looked at him quietly.</p><br/><p>Her black almond eyes were bright and even brighter than the stars in the sky.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu seemed to come back to life, his heart was softened by her gaze. He put the lantern on the ground and slowly walked over to her. \u201cXie Zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>He stepped closer, and she looked up.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuh?\u201d</p><br/><p>Her sound was long, making her more intoxicating in the moonlight.</p><br/><p>Before he lost her, Yan Yu had already experienced the joy of having recovered from his loss. He bent down and took her into his arms, \u201cWhy did you run around?\u201d</p><br/><p>His tone was reproachful, but his arms tightened around her.</p><br/><p>When he faced her, he was always worried about his gains and losses. Sooner or later, he would be tortured into madness by her.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tried to pull away from him, but the more she struggled, the tighter he tightened his grip on her. She felt her bones about to shatter under his grip, and she grunted uncomfortably. \u201cI just want to sit here.\u201d</p><br/><p>His voice trembled. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me?\u201d</p><br/><p>The panic he felt when he couldn\u2019t find her earlier was still there. His heart beat violently, and he was unable to calm down for a long time.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen blinked and said calmly. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be busy listening to your aunt\u2019s words. She\u2019s dying. I\u2019m not going to bother you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu froze, \u201cHer words\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said, \u201cI heard it all, that she wants you to take Ouyang Yi as your concubine \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Without waiting for her to finish speaking, he hurriedly explained, \u201cI won\u2019t take a concubine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did she come out because she heard this?</p><br/><p>He had already made up his mind when he looked for her just now. He wouldn\u2019t take Ouyang Yi as his concubine. He would find her a good husband and marry her off as an answer to Madame Li.</p><br/><p>But it was impossible for him to accept her.</p><br/><p>Except for XieZhen, who else would he want?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tilted her head. \u201cMadam Li entrusted Ouyang Yi to you on her deathbed. Won\u2019t you accept her?\u201d</p><br/><p>He crouched down slowly and wrapped his arms around her waist. \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen fell silent. \u201cWhy not?\u201d</p><br/><p>He buried himself in her stomach and said nothing.</p><br/><p>\u201cBrother Xiao Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI just want you,\u201d he finally said in a muffled voice.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

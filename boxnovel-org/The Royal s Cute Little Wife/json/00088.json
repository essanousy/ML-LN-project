The second thought was to push him away and look towards the door: \u201cLet Shuang Yu in \u2026 I want Shuang Yu come in! \u201d</p><br/><p>When she was worried, her face would turn red with embarrassment. Yet, she had to use her small temper in front of him, making her look extremely cute.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s embrace was empty. He asked with regret: \u201cYou\u2019re weak, so why can\u2019t I help you clean yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He actually had this idea!</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was shocked, as she quickly retreated and crashed into the barrel with her back, \u201cI, I can wash by myself \u2026 I don\u2019t need your help. \u201d</p><br/><p>If she really wanted him to help her\u2026 Xie Zhen felt extremely ashamed when she thought of that scene. Although the two of them had already become husband and wife, they had not reached that stage yet \u2026 Seeing that she was about to cry, Yan Yu pitied her and couldn\u2019t rush in. He could only take a step back and call the servant maids in on her behalf as he walked out of the screen with his turn around his body, \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you outside.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen nodded repeatedly and heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan came in and sprinkled some peach blossoms on the tub. As they helped Xie Zhen change his clothes, they asked, \u201cWhy is Miss\u2019s face so red?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unconsciously, she touched his face, causing Glistening Water to blink in surprise. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu nodded, \u201cIs the water too hot? Your servant poured more cold water on it? \u201d Actually, it wasn\u2019t just her face that was blushing. Her entire body was also pink \u2026</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen knew that it was not because of the water, so she hurriedly said there was no need, and casually lied: \u201cIt is probably because of a fever.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan believed him and asked no further.</p><br/><p>This time, when Xie Zhen met with an accident in the Lingyin Temple, the two of them, as the closest two servant maids s, were actually unable to protect her properly. They had almost apologized with their deaths. If anything happened to Xie Zhen, they would not be able to see the people of Madam Leng and Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion again in their lifetime. After Yan Yu returned, the two of them had been kneeling in Zhanyue Court the entire time. Fortunately, Xie Zhen had managed to find them and was uninjured, so the two of them stopped blaming themselves.</p><br/><p>Of course, Xie Zhen didn\u2019t know about this change in their hearts.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen sat in the bathtub, his body was wrapped in hot water, all the fatigue in his body instantly disappeared. She laid on the side of the bucket while Shuang Yu washed her hair. When she thought about what happened next, she became a little absent-minded.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu gathered her hair in his hands, put on the soap and carefully rubbed it, \u201cWhere did Miss fall last night? The servant searched the mountain for several hours, but was unable to find you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tilted his head and half-opened his watery eyes, \u201cI fell into the river and was washed away by the water \u2026 Even down to the foot of the mountain, I didn\u2019t know where that place was. \u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan sighed, while Shuang Yan rubbed her arms with his towel and said angrily: \u201cThis First Prince is so arrogant!\u201d</p><br/><p>They were Xie Zhen\u2019s personal servant maids and had not hidden some things from them, so they all knew what was going on.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu scooped up a spoonful of water and washed the foam off her head, \u201cHow was that lady saved? You didn\u2019t encounter any danger, did you? \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said that she didn\u2019t, but after thinking about it, she still didn\u2019t say it, \u201cI walked for a while, found a house and stayed there for the night.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did the two of them let go of the big rock in their hearts and seriously bathed Xie Zhen. After washing up, they would help her wipe off the water stains on her body and put on the blouse made of leno s and embroidered shoes.</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen walked out of the screen, Yan Yu was sitting on the Eight Immortals chair in the hall and explaining things to the steward Zhao. He tilted his head and saw that she had come out, and hurriedly sent the steward over to her.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>As Xie Zhen sat in front of the copper mirror, for some reason, she suddenly thought of the booklet Madam Leng had shown her.</p><br/><p>When Madam Leng gave her the book, she didn\u2019t know what was inside at all. When she flipped it open, she was immediately shocked by the painting on it \u2026 She only skimmed through a few pages, then hid the book under the clothes closet and never opened it again.</p><br/><p>But the images were etched deeply into her mind.</p><br/><p>There were all kinds of postures \u2026 She even doubted how it was done!</p><br/><p>When she raised her head, she saw Yan Yu in the mirror. She suddenly turned her head and saw he was standing behind her. He looked at her: \u201cWhat are you thinking about? You blushed.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen shook her head like a rattle drum, trying to cover it up, \u201cI didn\u2019t think of anything!\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, the credibility of her words was not very high, so Yan Yu looked away gave a low laugh.</p><br/><p>He had really changed a lot this year \u2026 She always felt like he was more like a mature man now? In front of him, Xie Zhen was like a angry little girl.</p><br/><p>Oh, and a spoiled little girl.</p><br/><p>Sensing her nervousness, he took a towel from a nearby wooden rack and stood behind her. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t your hair drying?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he progressed, she relaxed.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen turned around and looked at him, then quickly said with looked away, \u201cI\u2019m waiting for big brother Xiao Yu to help me wipe my hair.\u201d He bit his lip, feeling a bit shy.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu gathered her hair into his palms, and used towel s to slowly suck in the water. Looking at her pink face in the mirror, he could not help but lower his head and bite her left ear. \u201cWhy did you let me wipe your hair when you didn\u2019t let me bathe you just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>You actually still hold a grudge, you stingy bastard.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen puffed her cheeks and scolded him in the mirror, \u201cThen don\u2019t wipe it.\u201d</p><br/><p>He pretended not to hear her and whispered in her ear, \u201cLittle bastard.\u201d His hands were strong, and in a few moments he had half dried her hair. He picked up the ivory comb from the dowry and slowly smoothed out her three thousand strands. Xie Zhen was very comfortable with him, but very quickly her entire body relaxed. She sat on top of the embroidered pier and leaned in front of him, and asked curiously: \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu asked: \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>She muttered to herself, but she could not help it. \u201cYou are at the border \u2026 Did something happen? \u201d</p><br/><p>He did not understand. He had encountered many things at the border, so he did not know which one she was referring to.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stammered for a long time, his black, big eyes turned into slits as he said, \u201cYou weren\u2019t like this in the past \u2026 \u2026 You seem to have changed. \u201d</p><br/><p>He replied with an \u2018oh\u2019, as if he did not care about it at all. \u201cWhat has become of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026 You used to be childish. \u201d Xie Zhen mercilessly cut through.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu clenched his teeth, and stared at her, \u201cHow childish?\u201d</p><br/><p>She tilted her head as she thought about it seriously, and explained it so clearly and clearly, \u201cI get angry whenever I see it, and I get angry when I see it \u2026\u201d And they always like to get angry and yell at me. \u201d</p><br/><p>The rebuke was as if she herself was not childish.</p><br/><p>Actually, the two of them were on par with each other, neither of them had the right to say anything about the other. It was just that Xie Zhen had grown up by a year, and felt that he had matured, even Yan Yu had matured, and that was why he had the words he had just said.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu used his wooden brush to knock on her head.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen held his head and stuck his tongue out at him, \u201cI don\u2019t know, it wasn\u2019t me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Slick!</p><br/><p>Yan Yu looked at her and chuckled. He then bent down and wrapped her around his arm between the copper mirror and slowly approached her, \u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me not to yell at you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked into his eyes and nodded.</p><br/><p>He then asked: \u201cLittle Lamb, I\u2019ve done it, can I touch you now?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had been circled around by him, and for a moment, he didn\u2019t know how to reply.</p><br/><p>One of the reasons that Xie Zhen asked was to not touch her, but he never said which one of them would allow him to touch her. Xie Zhen thought for a long time, then suddenly turned her head with a flushed face, \u201cI said that I can\u2019t \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Will you listen?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu didn\u2019t wait for her to finish, he carried her and walked over to the bed.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>This was the first time the two of them were not experienced enough and would more or less be making a joke.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen shrank into a corner on the bed, his entire body was wrapped up tightly, his tears flowing down his eyes, \u201cYou liar, it obviously hurts!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was perspiring profusely, he did not expect her to kick him away so suddenly. Since it had already come to this critical point, was he going to stop?</p><br/><p>He tried to pull the blanket away and pull her out from within, \u201cLittle Lamb, I am not lying to you \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not let him touch her, and curled up into a ball and rolled around, the back of her head facing him, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu felt a headache, this was truly a little ancestor, his entire body was so tender, he couldn\u2019t even touch it, how was he going to continue?</p><br/><p>He had been waiting at the border for a year, living the life of a monk. If he still couldn\u2019t touch her when he returned, then he would be even more pitiful than a monk.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu made up his mind and turned over to once again cover her body. He could only start over and slowly and carefully serve her again.</p><br/><p>The moonlight outside the window was hazy, and stars hung in the sky in groups of twos and threes. Occasionally, the sounds of insects could be heard, adding to the tranquility of the night.</p><br/><p>Outside the house stood two gatekeeping servant maids s. They were precisely Shuang Yu\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>The two of them had originally been dozing off, but after hearing the sounds in the room and realizing what it was, their faces immediately flushed red.</p><br/><p>They were already twenty years old and following by Xie Zhen\u2019s side. Even though they weren\u2019t married yet, they knew exactly what was going on. Ever since Xie Zhen had married Yan Yu, the two of them had not been getting along well. Every time they returned to Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion, he would call the two of them to the side to interrogate them.</p><br/><p>Now, the huge burden in the Madam\u2019s heart could finally be put down. Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan thought.</p><br/><p>After finishing his business, he should have to use hot water. Shuang Yu carried a lantern and was about to go to the kitchen to boil some water, when he suddenly heard Xie Zhen\u2019s voice from inside, mixed with her sobbing, \u201cI\u2019m already bleeding \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She and Shuang Yan looked at each other, seeing the awkwardness in each other\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu said: \u201cI will go heat up the water, Your Highness should be needing it in a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yan nodded, \u201cYou can go, I\u2019ll guard here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Very quickly, Xie Zhen stopped crying.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yan\u2019s face flushed red when he heard it outside the door. He felt that it was really hot tonight, it was not this hot in the past, could it be because it was almost summer?</p><br/><p>A quarter of an hour later, Shuang Yu had finished boiling water in the kitchen.</p><br/><p>But the house didn\u2019t let them in, let alone ask for hot water.</p><br/><p>An hour later, it was still the same.</p><br/><p>Not even two hours later.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan stood outside the house, waiting until the sky had turned white. Only then did the sound of movement come out from the room again.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>Last night, Xie Zhen was exhausted, his entire body aching from the pain, and was sleepless.</p><br/><p>She had originally wanted to have a good rest today, but she was awakened early in the morning by Yan Yu. She was in the light sleep to begin with, so she couldn\u2019t fall asleep even a little bit of movement. Now that Yan Yu had only gotten up and put on his clothes, she bewilderedly opened her eyes.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu put on his outer robe, turned around and rubbed the tears at the corner of her eyes with his thumb, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you sleep for a bit more?\u201d</p><br/><p>Last night, she cried so much that he could not coax her. He did not know that she could cry this much. She was truly a person made of water.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen huffed and puffed, her tone was a little angry from getting up, her soft voice sounded a little hoarse: \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Her bath was in vain.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was in a good mood, she would do whatever she wanted, \u201cI\u2019ll get the servant maids to boil some hot water, I\u2019ll help you clean your body.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen hurriedly pulled back, her small white face tensed up. \u201cDon\u2019t\u2026 I\u2019ll do it myself. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu asked her: \u201cCan you do it yourself?\u201d</p><br/><p>She did not speak.</p><br/><p>After a long while, he buried his face in the pillow, his cheeks were completely red, no one knew what shy scene he was thinking, but he said depressingly: \u201cThen let Shuang Yu come in and help me.\u201d</p><br/><p>I don\u2019t want him anyway.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu knew that she was thin-skinned, and was afraid that it would make people anxious. He no longer teased her: \u201cThen I\u2019m going out?\u201d</p><br/><p>She made a sound of acknowledgment.</p><br/><p>Footsteps sounded in the room and gradually disappeared behind the screen.</p><br/><p>Not long after Shuang Yu came in, she quietly peeked her head out from the bed. Her eyes were red, one look was enough to tell that she cried pitifully last night. Shuang Yu was originally a little uncomfortable, but seeing that Xie Zhen was even more shy than him, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh, as he wet his towel\u2019s face and spirit, carefully helping her wash. If she had to rub other places, she had to do it herself. Since Shuang Yu couldn\u2019t force her, he gave her the towel.</p><br/><p>She lingered in the house for an hour and just as she was about to put on her clothes, Yan Yu brought a porcelain bottle from the outside.</p><br/><p>She quickly shrunk herself in and opened her big, watery eyes. \u201cWhy did you come in again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu sat at the bedside and waved the medicine bottle in his hand, \u201cThe wounds on your body will only heal faster if they are treated with medicine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He said it so lightly, who was to blame for that!?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t even have the strength to sit up. He pulled her into his arms and slowly spread the medicine on her body, applying extreme gentleness on every single wound on her body. In the end, she was too embarrassed to raise her head no matter how she buried herself in his neck. He helped her put on her clothes one by one and pecked her on the lips, \u201cDon\u2019t call me Little Lamb, call me Little Turtle.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was puzzled. \u201cWhy?\u201d</p><br/><p>He carried her to the mirror and stroked her head. \u201cDo you look like a tortoise right now?\u201d</p><br/><p>She bit his neck. \u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he tightened his grip on her. Luckily there were no other servant maids in the house, otherwise he would have laughed at her.</p><br/><p>In the mirror, Yan Yu saw two people hugging each other. If she were to raise her head at this moment, she would definitely see a rare tenderness in his eyes.</p><br/><p>He lifted her up and was about to carry her out of the room when she called out, \u201cPut me down!\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s fine if she was tired of being in the house, but if she was being like this in front of the servant maids, where would she put her face \u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Yu asked: \u201cAre you really going to come down?\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded affirmatively.</p><br/><p>When Yan Yu released her hands, she frantically climbed down from his body. Unfortunately, the moment her feet touched the ground, she felt her body go soft and almost fell to the ground.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu caught her quickly, and she was ashamed and angry, \u201cIt\u2019s all your fault!\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded and pursed his lips, \u201cYes, it\u2019s all my fault.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen glared at him fiercely.</p><br/><p>He laughed out loud.</p><br/><p>\u2026</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"max-width: 870px;margin: 5px auto;background: repeating-linear-gradient( 45deg, #fff6cc, #fff6cc 5px, #f3ecc7 5px, #f3ecc7 10px );\">\n<!-- Composite Start -->\n<div id=\"M562762ScriptRootC864255\">\n</div>\n<script async=\"\" src=\"https://jsc.mgid.com/m/e/media.boxnovel.org.864255.js\"></script>\n<!-- Composite End -->\n</div>\n<hr class=\"chr-end\"/>\n<div class=\"chr-nav\" id=\"chr-nav-bottom\">\n<div class=\"btn-group\">\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/the-royals-cute-little-wife-chapter-87-intimate\" id=\"prev_chap\" title=\"Chapter 87 - Intimate\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left\"></span>\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Prev Chapter</span>\n</a>\n<button class=\"btn btn-success chr-jump\" type=\"button\">\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-list-alt\"></span>\n</button>\n<a class=\"btn btn-success\" href=\"http://boxnovel.org/the-royals-cute-little-wife-chapter-89\" id=\"next_chap\" title=\"Chapter 89\">\n<span class=\"hidden-xs\">Next Chapter</span>\n<span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right\"></span>\n</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"text-center\">\n<button class=\"btn btn-warning\" data-chr-id=\"329998\" id=\"chr-error\" type=\"button\"><span class=\"glyphicon glyphicon-exclamation-sign\"></span> Report chapter\r\n                        </button>\n</div>\n<div class=\"bg-info text-center visible-md visible-lg box-notice\">\r\n                        Tip: You can use left, right, A and D keyboard keys to browse between chapters.\r\n                    </div>\n</div>"}

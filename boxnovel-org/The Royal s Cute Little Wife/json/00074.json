If Madam Leng were to find out that she was going to the Lin Family by dressing up as a boy, she would probably not agree to let her do so.</p><br/><p>How could a girl be so bold? If she were to be found out, her reputation would go down the drain.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was also afraid, but when she thought that the Lin might harm her own family, she mustered up her courage and lied to Madam Leng, saying that she would be a guest of the General\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>She might be able to help father if she tried to find some evidence.</p><br/><p>She sat with Xie Zhen in the carriage of the General\u2019s Mansion, and in the carriage, with Zhong Rou in it, who asked for the clothes she had prepared.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun opened it and saw that it was a manservant\u2019s green robe.</p><br/><p>She took it and compared it with her body. It seemed that its size was suitable for her. It seemed that Zhong Rou had specifically asked someone to make it for her.</p><br/><p>She was young and tender. At first glance, she looked a little bit different when she dressed up as an servant boy that was even whiter and more delicate than an ordinary ones.</p><br/><p>She changed clothes in carriage and held onto her hat as tears welled up in her eyes. \u201cElder sister \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI, I\u2019m a little afraid \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen could not bear it at this moment. Ah Xun was only thirteen. What if there was an accident?</p><br/><p>She took out a handkerchief and wiped her tears, then turned to Zhong Rou, \u201csister Zhong, is there any other way?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cShe\u2019s never been to the Lin Family. What if something happens to her and her identity is discovered? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Rou was the opposite of Xie Xun. She was bold and decisive, thinking that if there was a problem to be solved, she would have to do it even if there was a thorny path in front of her.</p><br/><p>When she saw Xie Xun crying, she did a quick double take that there were some parts that she hadn\u2019t considered thoroughly, making this pampered little girl feel fearful.</p><br/><p>\u201cIt was my careless. You will follow me when the time comes and there won\u2019t be any problems.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are really afraid, then hide in the carriage. I will try to call out Miss Lin\u2019s servant maids, but you will only have to sneak a peek inside the carriage. Just don\u2019t come out.\u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did she relax, nodding with reddened eyes.</p><br/><p>Seeing that the carriage was about to leave, Xie Zhen asked worriedly, \u201csister Zhong, when are you coming back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019ll wait in the mansion, so that my mother won\u2019t suspect us.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Rou calculated the time and assured her, \u201cIt won\u2019t be more than four hours. Fifth Brother and I will be back as soon as possible.\u201d</p><br/><p>Then Xie Zhen got out of the carriage and looked back over her shoulder.</p><br/><p>There were several horses parked outside the carriage, and they were all from the General\u2019s Estate.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang had been waiting for a long time.</p><br/><p>It was cold, and he was standing straight beside the carriage in a black embroidered gold cloak, like a juniper in the mountains.</p><br/><p>He was about to set off when he got on the horse and took a glance into the carriage. \u201cElder sister, are we leaving or not?\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Rou lifted the curtain and said to him, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</p><br/><p>With this flip, he saw the adonis sitting beside Zhong Rou.</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t help but smile, lightening the seriousness on his face. \u201cElder sister, when did you buy this servant?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHow come I\u2019ve never seen him before? \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun looked at him, pursed her pink lips, and inched inside, trying to reduce her sense of existence.</p><br/><p>Zhong Rou moved the person behind her. Perhaps she knew what her little brother\u2019s morals were, so she didn\u2019t want the young Xie Xun to be harmed by him. \u201cFollow your path.\u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled unconcernedly, looked away, and concentrated on riding his horse.</p><br/><p>As soon as Xie Xun left, Xie Zhen came back.</p><br/><p>When Madam Leng heard the servant maids\u2019 report, she was truly shocked.</p><br/><p>Without any words in advance, how come Xie Zhen came back all of a sudden?</p><br/><p>Could it be that she had a conflict with the sixth prince?</p><br/><p>As she thought this, Xie Zhen had already walked into the Jade Yard and arrived in the hall.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng was embroidering on Arhat Bed. She took away the needles and threads, then welcomed her into the room.</p><br/><p>Without saying anything, she first checked her from front to back, before asking, \u201cWhy did you suddenly come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you alone? Where\u2019s the sixth prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen made the circuit of her body to cooperated with her. \u201cMother, what are you looking at?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAre you worried that I got beaten up?\u201d</p><br/><p>She really was an ungrateful little enemy. Madam Leng gave her a cold glare and said, \u201cDon\u2019t be so mischievous.\u201d</p><br/><p>She quickly stopped laughing and stood in front of Madam Leng, rolling her eyes. Her strange appearance made people love and hate her.</p><br/><p>If Madam Leng wasn\u2019t worried about her, why was she so nervous?</p><br/><p>However, from her looks, she didn\u2019t seem to had a conflict with the sixth prince.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng brought her to sit on the Arhat Bed and relax a little. \u201d Little Lamb, tell mother, why did you come back?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen curled her lips. \u201cI miss mother, so I came back,\u201d he said with a smile.</p><br/><p>No wonder Madam Leng made such a big fuss over nothing. She was truly worried for her.</p><br/><p>A few days ago, Gao Xun came to visit, and the relationship between Yan Yu and him was extremely tense. Others might not know, but Madam Leng did clearly.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was a man and a prince, but he couldn\u2019t bear to have other man around him coveting his wife if he cares a little about Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>However, Gao Xun couldn\u2019t forget about Xie Zhen, although he tried his best to restrain his love, he still couldn\u2019t conceal the feelings in his heart.</p><br/><p>At the time, she was afraid there would be a gap between Yan Yu and Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>She had been restless ever since Xie Zhen and Li Yu left, and now Xie Zhen was back in a few days. How could she not worry?</p><br/><p>Reluctantly, she asked again, \u201cAre you not at odds with the sixth prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen kicked off her embroidered shoes, sat across from her and looked at the peonies she\u2019d embroidered, and said absently, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI told him I was coming back yesterday, and he agreed. \u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did the Madam Leng heave a sigh of relief. She called a servant maid serve the tea before pinching her hand and saying, \u201cIn the future, you are not allowed to scare me like this.\u201d</p><br/><p>She giggled and said obediently, \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that mother was not intimidated.\u201d</p><br/><p>The servant maid served her favorite apricot tea. She held it to her mouth and took a sip. The taste of the tea was even better at her own home.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng got cold easily, so there was already a fire in the room, and she sat for a while befor feeling the heat, and then she took off the outside bast and walked about in her emerald blue crepe dress and white spring dress.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng said. \u201cAh Xun was taken to the general\u2019s mansion by Miss Zhong. She won\u2019t be here for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>She knew, of course, that it was she who had seen Xie Xun\u2019s leaving with her own eyes.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen pretended to be knowing nothing about it. She revealed an expression of reger. \u201cThen where are my brother and father?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve been in the palace since early in the morning,\u201d Madam Leng said.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen nodded, and asked about everyone in the yard, but refused to say anything about herself.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng\u2019s patience was not bad, but she did not expect to lose to her. She was forced to become anxious and brought the girl to her. \u201cTell me honestly, is there something wrong?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen blinked. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng pressed her forehead with her fingers, \u201cI gave birth to you, so how can I not know you?\u201d</p><br/><p>She was scolded for a while before smiling and curling her eyes. \u201cMother is really magical. I can\u2019t hide anything from you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Indeed, something had happened. Madam Leng\u2019s heart skipped a beat. She was worried for her, but she also hated this damned girl for being so secretive.</p><br/><p>If it was an ordinary matter, she would have already told her the truth without even being asked. To be able to make it so difficult for her to speak, it was either a matter of nothing, or a matter of great importance.</p><br/><p>As expected, Madam Leng sat in silence for a moment, unable to speak as she had listened to what Xie Zhen told to her.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen ,put her head on her legs, and lifted her face to ask her, \u201cmother, I don\u2019t want her to stay in the mansion, and I don\u2019t want to see her. Am I a bad girl?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng looked down at her and couldn\u2019t help pinching her nose. \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/><p>She opened her big, watery eyes wide, somewhat confused. \u201cThen I\u2019ll just be a bad person.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng couldn\u2019t help but laugh. After she finished laughing, she had no choice but to face the question directly. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t step forward in this matter. You should just leave it to the sixth prince \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you deviate even a little bit, you will be branded as being jealous. \u201d</p><br/><p>Once a girl was branded with the word \u201cjealous\u201d, it wasn\u2019t a small case. Not only was she infamous, even her sisters would be implicated.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen knew how serious it would be. She bore Leng\u2019s words in mind. \u201cBut she was rude to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng asked, \u201chow rude was she to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen told her the whole story slowly. In the end, she even sniffled.</p><br/><p>\u201cIf Yan Yu didn\u2019t take her in, how could she get the qualifications to stay in the Prince\u2019s Mansion? She wouldn\u2019t know how to appreciate favors.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her cheeks were puffed up with anger, like a child\u2019s.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng sighed, \u201cMy words may not sound good. Just get the meaning behind them.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her eyes widened. \u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf a big dog barked at you on the street, would you bark it back?\u201d</p><br/><p>She thought about it and shook her head. \u201cOf course not, I\u2019m not a dog.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng looked at her with a smile. \u201cThey are the same. You said Ouyang Yi has no manners and she is disrespectful to you. If you continue arguing with her, won\u2019t you place yourself in the same position as her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen got to understand a little. She got up from Madam Leng\u2019s lap. \u201cThen what if she provokes me in the future?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are the Prince\u2019s wife, and you are also the young lady of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion. You must always put on your proper airs so that she will not dare to act impudently in front of you again.\u201d</p><br/><p>She tilted her head, brooding over one thing. \u201cWhat if she stays in the Prince\u2019s Mansion all the time?\u201d</p><br/><p>This was the most important issue, and it could not be ignored by Leng.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng had her answer honestly, \u201d Madam Li asked the sixth prince to take Ouyang Yi as his concubine. Did the sixth prince agree to her request?\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head.</p><br/><p>That day at Spring Blossom Castle, Yan Yu had confidently said that he would not take Ouyang Yi as his concubine.</p><br/><p>She believed in him, so she didn\u2019t make things difficult for him these days.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng continue to ask. \u201cThen what is his attitude?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe said he wouldn\u2019t take a concubine.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThen what\u2019s there to worry about?\u201d</p><br/><p>The fact that the sixth prince gave her such a promise proved that he was sincere to her. Madam Leng gave a smile of relief as she held her hand. \u201cMother knows you\u2019re in a difficult situation, but you can\u2019t step in and deal with this matter. You can only leave it to the sixth prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIf you are not happy, you can use a few tricks.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not fully understand. \u201cWhat kind of tricks?\u201d</p><br/><p>However, Madam Leng was unwilling to say any more. This was an opportunity for them to learn from each other. If she were to say too much, it would instead be bad. It would be better for them to comprehend it themselves.</p><br/><p>Before noon, Zhong Rou took Xie Xun back to Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng was sleeping in the house, and Xie Zhen came out to greet them.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was still wearing the boy\u2019s clothes when she got off the carriage. The only difference was that her face was covered with a layer of dust.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen subconsciously looked to Zhong Rou, who apologized to her, \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault and fifth brother\u2019s fault\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cBut rest assured, princess, the Lin family did not recognize Seventh Miss.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

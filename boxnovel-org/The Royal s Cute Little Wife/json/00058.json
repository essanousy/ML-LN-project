There were two stacks of documents.</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince had recently investigated the matter and wanted to take advantage of this opportunity to get rid of Lin Rui.</p><br/><p>Lin Rui is the eldest prince\u2019s henchman. The eldest prince was born of the former empress, while the former empress died when he was six years old. Emperor Yuan Hui had made him the crown prince, but when he was ten years old, he tried to kill his second brother, Yan Tao, and was found out by Emperor Yuan Hui. Then the emperor exempted him from the crown prince\u2019s position on the grounds of his brutal temperament, and he had changed the position of the crown prince to the second prince, Yan Tao.</p><br/><p>Throughout all these years, the First Prince had been hiding in the dark, accumulating his strength and energy. It was unknown when he would bite back.</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince had been afraid of the First Prince for so long that he had thought of ways to get rid of his men.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu opened a stack of documents that recorded Qing Zhou\u2019s tax lists and military strength for the past ten years. He looked through the pages and realized that Xie Liqing truly had some skill and shouldn\u2019t have been left unoccupied at home.</p><br/><p>He also didn\u2019t know what the Emperor Yuan Hui was planning. He didn\u2019t let him stay in Qing Zhou, nor did he give him any words of confirmation.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu kept reading from day to night, and the last rays of light from the evening sun slipped down from the western mountains. It quickly darkened, but he remained in a posture the entire time.</p><br/><p>At first, it was for Xie Zhen, but gradually, he was attracted by Xie Liqing\u2019s ability and skills. He didn\u2019t seem tired at all. With a jolt of his mind, he realized that it was already late at night.</p><br/><p>He called Wu Ze over, rubbed his forehead and asked, \u201cWhat time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ze replied, \u201cYour highness, it\u2019s a quarter past seven.\u201d</p><br/><p>It\u2019s so late.</p><br/><p>He got up, with his whole body stiff. He held down the papers he had prepared and walked out of the room. \u201cHas the Princess eaten yet?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Ze had been standing outside the door the whole time, as he did not know.</p><br/><p>When he returned to the main room, there was an oil lamp burning in the inner room. Through the window, he could see the shadows inside.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was sitting on the lady couch by the window, probably freshly showered. The servant maids was standing behind her, combing her hair. She tilted her head and sang softly.</p><br/><p>Her voice was as soft as ever, echoing through the window and softly coming into Yan Yu\u2019s ears.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu stopped abruptly. He had only heard her sing a song once before, and just that single song, he would never forget it for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>When he thought of her song, he would recall the first time they met.</p><br/><p>He listened for a moment, then went in through the front door.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen caught a glimpse of him out of the corner of her eyes and remembered that she had just kissed him, so she felt a little embarrassed and a little shy.</p><br/><p>She grabbed the fan on the table and covered half of her face, revealing only her pair of black eyes. With a flicker, she asked, \u201cWhy are you back so late?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHave you had dinner?\u201d</p><br/><p>He shook his head. \u201cNot yet.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He thought she was going to care about him, but she said regretfully, \u201cBut I did.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu choked and asked her, \u201cYou didn\u2019t leave any for me?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYes,\u201d she said.</p><br/><p>Then she got up from the couch and asked Shang Yu to serve the meal.</p><br/><p>Knowing that he had been in the study, she did not disturb him, and was afraid that it would be more embarrassing for them to be in the same room, so she did not go to have dinner with him.</p><br/><p>Shang Yu warmed up the meal and brought it to the table.</p><br/><p>Sitting at the table, Yan Yu couldn\u2019t help but look towards the inner room.</p><br/><p>He finished a bowl of rice in two or three mouthfuls and went to the next side room to take a shower. When he came back, Xie Zhen had already gone to sleep in the side room.</p><br/><p>Lying in bed, he couldn\u2019t fall asleep.</p><br/><p>He sat up, put on his shoes, and knocked on the door. \u201cXie Zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no respond.</p><br/><p>He pushed at the door but didn\u2019t push it open.</p><br/><p>He was somewhat disappointed. He had thought that their relationship would progress after today\u2019s matter, but he never expected that she would still reject him thousands of miles away.</p><br/><p>After standing by the door for a while, he was about to leave when Tan Mei opened the door from the inside, yawning as she went to the toilet.</p><br/><p>Upon seeing him outside the door, her mouth was wide open. \u201cYour highness \u2026 your highness?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu ignored her and walked straight into the room.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was lying in bed, with her back to him, sleeping.</p><br/><p>He closed the door behind him, bolted the door, and stepped over to the bed.</p><br/><p>He took off his shoes, got into bed, and slowly lay down beside her.</p><br/><p>\u201cXie Zhen?\u201d</p><br/><p>He called out, but she didn\u2019t respond.</p><br/><p>He leaned forward and took her hand in his, just in time to hold her in his arms.</p><br/><p>He put his ear close to hers and took a bite. His voice was low. \u201cXie Zhen, wake up.\u201d</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen was waken up, it was dark, then she realized she was being held, and she turned to him and tried to resist. \u201cWho?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu said, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Startled, she blurted out, \u201cWhy is it you again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Last time, he had barged in just like this. That time, he had been afraid of thunder. What was it this time?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tried to get out of his arms, but she was not as strong as he was, so for a long time she couldn\u2019t.</p><br/><p>She lowered her head and bit into his arm. \u201cLet go of me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu frowned. No matter how she tried to bite him, he wouldn\u2019t let go of her.</p><br/><p>She finally got tired of making a ruckus and panted in his arms. \u201cYou, you eat your words \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu asked, \u201cwhat words?\u201d</p><br/><p>She said angrily, \u201cYou said you wouldn\u2019t touch me, so why do you hug me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Annoyed, she accused, \u201cA big liar.\u201d</p><br/><p>After a long pause, he finally said, \u201cI\u2019m not a liar.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou are.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou\u2013are\u2013\u201d</p><br/><p>Her voice was long and drawn-out, as if she was arguing with him until the end of time!</p><br/><p>Yan Yu paused, \u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh.\u201d</p><br/><p>Anyway, he had never won an argument with her.</p><br/><p>It would be better to let her go, and make her happier.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen lowered her head, and looked to the wall. \u201cWhat you say never counts. You always lie to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>She tried to settle old scores, one by one. \u201cYou promised that we sleep in separate rooms, but you came to my room on our wedding night, and Shang Yu told me later. Don\u2019t think I didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p><br/><p>He was silent and speechless.</p><br/><p>She added, \u201cYou hugged me at that raining night and yelled at me another day.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAren\u2019t you a liar?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu didn\u2019t expect her to remember everything so clearly. His face was pale and green, but she couldn\u2019t see it clearly in the darkness, otherwise she would have laughed at him.</p><br/><p>\u201cI didn\u2019t lie to anyone.\u201d</p><br/><p>She said indignantly, \u201cThen you\u2019re lying to me alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>He did not retort. It seemed that he had tacitly accepted it.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen recalled another matter. \u201cYou used to say you were going to take me flying a kite, and then you left without a word, so you\u2019ve been a liar since you were a kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>She grunted. \u201cLittle liar when you were young, while big liar when you grew up.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was simply angered to death by her. He carried her to his chest with both hands, rolled over and pressed her under him. He bit her ear in anger: \u201cI can\u2019t even protect my own life, how can I fly a kite with you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was hardly breathing under his press, and tilted her head with confusing. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere\u2019s Auntie Song?\u201d</p><br/><p>She had always wondered where Auntie Song was, but she had asked him, and he didn\u2019t tell her, and she had tactfully stopped.</p><br/><p>Since he spoke of it today, she couldn\u2019t help but ask again.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was buried his head in her neck, and his overbearing posture disappeared in an instant, leaving only pain and powerlessness. He said, \u201cShe\u2019s dead.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was shocked, with her mouth open, so for a moment she didn\u2019t say a word.</p><br/><p>She remembered that Auntie Song was a very gentle and skilled person. Every time she went to the Li family, Auntie Song would treat her warmly and call her \u201cLittle Lamb\u201d affectionately.</p><br/><p>After so long, she forgot about Auntie Song\u2019s appearance but still remembered her gentle smile.</p><br/><p>Her eyes suddenly became moist as she stammered, \u201cThen \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat about your father?\u201d</p><br/><p>He closed his eyes and shivered. \u201cHe\u2019s dead, too.\u201d</p><br/><p>The scene from a few years ago once again appeared in front of his eyes, and he still couldn\u2019t forget his father and mother\u2019s widened eyes, as well as the shards of blood.</p><br/><p>He watched them die in front of him, but he could do nothing about it.</p><br/><p>He thought that after so many years, he would only be left with hatred and no longer be in pain. He didn\u2019t expect that he would still be unable to control his emotions when facing her.</p><br/><p>Everything in his childhood had been destroyed, except for her, and she was still the same.</p><br/><p>So to him, she was precious.</p><br/><p>After a long moment, Xie Zhen said slowly, \u201cGet up.\u201d</p><br/><p>He rolled away from her.</p><br/><p>The two of them lay face to face, the moonlight streaming over them from the window, and Xie Zhen wiped his eyes with her sleeve. \u201cDon\u2019t cry,\u201d she said.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu looked at her. \u201cI\u2019m not crying.\u201d</p><br/><p>She chuckled sweetly, \u201cI know you\u2019re holding it in. Actually, you can cry, but I won\u2019t laugh at you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu stared at her, but in the end, he did not cry.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t know what to say to comfort him. After all, she had never been experienced death of her family members.</p><br/><p>She wanted to ask who killed Auntie Song, but she was afraid that it would pierce his sore spot and he wouldn\u2019t tell her, so she didn\u2019t ask.</p><br/><p>The smile on her face gradually disappeared. She took the initiative to hold his hand and sniffled, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that it was like this \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He took her hand back. Perhaps it was her words that had done the job, perhaps it was because he had put up with it too hard. He had the urge to cry.</p><br/><p>He put his arms around her and held her tight to his chest. \u201cCan I hug you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen blinked. \u201cAren\u2019t you hugging him?\u201d</p><br/><p>He held her closer so she wouldn\u2019t see his expression.</p><br/><p>After a long moment, Xie Zhen felt like her waist was about to be broken, and she twisted it. \u201cI want to ask you something.\u201d</p><br/><p>He asked, \u201cWhat?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo, you left that time, it was not because you hated me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Even though she usually didn\u2019t say anything, she did mind it in her heart.</p><br/><p>It had given her quite a blow, causing her to fall into depression for quite a while. When she grew up and met him again, she subconsciously felt a bit of fear.</p><br/><p>With the sudden exaltation of his identity, she was even more afraid to open her heart to him.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu held onto her waist, not letting her move. \u201cI hate you?\u201d</p><br/><p>She nodded. \u201cDon\u2019t you?\u201d</p><br/><p>He rubbed his chin against the top of her head and said coldly, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tried to look up at him, but she could not move. \u201cReally?\u201d</p><br/><p>He coldly snorted, \u201cWhy would I lie to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen pursed her lips, and her hands quietly held to his sleeves. \u201cYou\u2019re a big liar.\u201d</p><br/><p>So he hadn\u2019t said those words before. So it was Ouyang Yi who had lied to her \u2026</p><br/><p>She felt that she was laughable. After being deceived for so long, why didn\u2019t she ask for confirmation?</p><br/><p>After he said that, the gap between the two of them was narrowed, and the barrier between them was broken at once, as same as that of many years ago.</p><br/><p>No, it was still a little different \u2026</p><br/><p>He rolled over on top of her and locked his eyes around her.</p><br/><p>She had a smile on her face, but she didn\u2019t realize how ambiguous her words were.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu leaned over and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cI am truly a liar.\u201d</p><br/><p>He found her lips and kissed them without hesitation.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

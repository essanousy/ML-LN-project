His heart seemed to have been hollowed out, as if he wanted to squeeze her into his heart to fill the hole. He had never seriously thought about what kind of feelings he had for her. At the beginning, he thought that it was all fun and was attracted by her gluttony. He felt that this was just a greedy little cat that he could tempt her with good food. She was both obedient and sensible. The more deeply they touched each other, the more he wanted to take the flower home and keep it in a vase, watering her every day to make her more attractive.</p><br/><p>He wanted to see her blossom and bear fruit with his own eyes. He wanted to let her completely belong to him.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that he had never had a woman before, but it was that he had never been in a relationship with anyone, that he had never had any true love, and that he had never been so interested in a woman.</p><br/><p>Did he really have feelings for her? To such a young girl who hadn\u2019t grown up yet?</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s hand on her back gradually moved down, landing on her soft waist, which could be held with one hand, soft and delicate as if he could break her with a little force. But how could he bear it? It was too late for him to love her.</p><br/><p>It\u2019s just that her skin is so good. White, almost transparent under the sun, he couldn\u2019t help but want to lower his head and have a taste of her face. What kind of smell was it, was it sweet or not? It had actually tempted him for such a long time.</p><br/><p>While Zhong Shang was still indulging in his fantasies, Xie Xun was already struggling in his embrace. After all, they were still at the entrance of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion\u2019s side door. Why did I wait for you? When will Big Brother Zhong Shang return? \u201d</p><br/><p>He couldn\u2019t say for sure, but how could he be sure about something like fighting? The day that they would return was also the day that the troops that had managed to repel the First Prince would return. A while ago, her parents had arranged for her to get married, but the other party was the eldest son of Grand Secretariat Gu. What if they really got engaged when he went to Lan Ling? Thinking about it this way, Zhong Shang had no choice but to take it seriously, \u201cEither half a year or one or two years.\u201d He paused, a hand holding onto the back of Xie Xun\u2019s head, he bent down to look her in the eye, and smirked, \u201cDuring the time I\u2019m gone, you must not get engaged to anyone else.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun tilted her head. She had always treated Zhong Shang as her big brother, just like Xie Rong, who had never thought much about the relationship between a man and a woman.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang had never seen such an unenlightened girl, if a normal girl heard this, they would all be blushing red, only she blinked her eyes as if she understood what he meant. However, he wasn\u2019t in a hurry. The more he didn\u2019t open his eyes, the better. This way, when he wasn\u2019t around, at least she wouldn\u2019t be tempted by others. If you are engaged, then you are the future wife of someone else. Naturally, you cannot be in contact with me again. \u201cI heard that Lan Ling region is prosperous and has special snacks. After the war ends, I\u2019ll bring some snacks back to the capital for you to eat. Wouldn\u2019t that mean I can\u2019t give them to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>This is a serious problem.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun hurriedly nodded, and agreed without even thinking, \u201cRest assured, Big Brother Zhong Shang, I won\u2019t be betrothed to anyone!\u201d</p><br/><p>The corner of Zhong Shang\u2019s mouth raised into a smile. She initially did not want to smile so openly, but she could not hold back the happiness in her heart. The corners of her mouth curled up, matching with his soul attracting peach blossom eyes, making her look both evil and spirited. What if your parents force you? \u201d</p><br/><p>She pouted. \u201cI want some delicious snacks.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u2026 \u2026. He just wanted to eat.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang stroked the bun on her head as he moved down along her face. He pinched her ears and quickly took off the earring, his voice low and gentle: \u201cIf your parents force you, you can say that you have someone you like. His name is Zhong Shang.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were too obvious, even if Xie Xun was a big idiot, he would definitely understand now.</p><br/><p>And she\u2019s fourteen, Chun. At such an age, she would occasionally talk about the girl\u2019s private matters with Xie Zhen or her little friend, and knew about matters related to love and love. Now that Zhong Shang had spoken so plainly \u2026 She stared at Zhong Shang in a daze as she licked her lips. She wanted to say something, but nothing came out of her mouth. He was flustered and helpless.</p><br/><p>She subconsciously took half a step back, pretending that she didn\u2019t understand, \u201cI \u2026 \u201cI \u2026\u201d After stuttering for a long time, he was finally able to utter a complete sentence. \u201cBut Big Brother Zhong Shang is not my person of choice \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s eyes turned deep, \u201cThen who is the person you like?\u201d</p><br/><p>She couldn\u2019t answer and was so anxious that she almost cried. She reached out her hand to change the topic, \u201cWhy are you using my earrings? \u201cGive it back to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang stretched out his arms but did not give it to her. After leaving for so long, he had to at least take some of her things to think about, right? He smirked, but his eyes were very gentle. \u201cDon\u2019t you want some snacks? I\u2019ll use this as my reward. \u201d</p><br/><p>She wasn\u2019t so stupid as to sell herself for a few snacks. She tugged on his sleeve, desperately trying to snatch back what she had given him, \u201cBig Brother Zhong Shang, give it back to me! I, I\u2019m going to get angry! \u201d</p><br/><p>He chuckled softly, feeling that she was so cute. He really wanted to hug her and rub her.</p><br/><p>The little girl\u2019s cheeks were puffed up with anger, her almond-shaped eyes were wide open, and she was angry and delicate.</p><br/><p>She suddenly jumped as her finger accidentally drew a line on the silver hook on her earpiece. The silver hook pierced through her finger and a droplet of blood the size of a mung bean instantly appeared. When he heard her hiss, he grabbed her hand, bent his head, took her slender white forefinger, and sucked away the blood, afraid that she would hurt him, and licked it lightly.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun\u2019s finger went numb, and hurriedly took it out of his mouth as she said with a red face: \u201c\u2026 Give me back my earrings, will you? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang looked into her eyes, \u201cThen tell me, who is your lover?\u201d</p><br/><p>She shook her head and honestly said no.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang was a little glad but also a little disappointed. He quickly adjusted his mood, and gently helped her put on the earrings once more. \u201cWhen I return from Lan Ling, Little Sister Ah Xun will give me these earrings.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun waited until he had put it on before covering his ears and taking two steps back. His eyes were red like a frightened rabbit, \u201cI don\u2019t want to \u2026 This is the earring that my mom gave me. I really like it. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang wanted to continue speaking when suddenly a servant maids wearing green clothes ran over, looking flustered, \u201cMiss, the Madam is here to see you \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprised, she opened her mouth but didn\u2019t say anything. She turned and ran inside with a guilty conscience.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang grabbed her fingertips, \u201cRemember my words \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun anxiously struggled free from his grasp, her heart thumping loudly. She quickly ordered the servant maids to close the door.</p><br/><p>Just as he closed the door, Xie Xun stared at the door in a daze, while the Madam Leng walked over personally from afar. Seeing her staring blankly at the door, Madam Leng could not help but ask: \u201cWutu, why are you here?\u201d</p><br/><p>She came back to her senses and her fingertips trembled. She turned her head and softly called out, \u201cMother!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang stood outside the door for a while, thinking that this girl had dodged really fast \u2026 He laughed, hopped on his horse, and rode slowly out.</p><br/><p>Three days passed in the blink of an eye. Tomorrow morning, the thirty thousand strong army would depart for the Lanling Mountains.</p><br/><p>In the evening, the clouds turned bright and the red clouds dyed half of the sky red. The sky was even more gorgeous than before.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun lied on a patch of grass behind the army field with his hands behind his head, quietly observing the clouds above him. There was a blade of grass in his mouth, something he had learned from Zhong Shang. His eyes were unmoving, and it was unknown what he was thinking. Only after a long while did he suddenly jump up from the grass when the sun was slowly setting in the west mountains. He pulled the grass out of his mouth and casually threw it away.</p><br/><p>The direction he was heading towards was towards the An Wang\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>This time, he did not wait at the door but openly paid a visit. A servant welcomed him into the central room and made him sit on a chair to wait.</p><br/><p>Not long after, Xie Zhen and Yan Yu walked over from the backyard. Before they even got close, they could hear Xie Zhen\u2019s sweet and crisp voice, \u201cBig Brother Gao Xun is here!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu said something in a low voice, and she deliberately said, \u201c\u2026 \u201cYou are petty.\u201d</p><br/><p>While they were talking, the two of them had already walked to the door.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen entertained Gao Xun like before, but being close to him didn\u2019t seem to be out of condition, so people couldn\u2019t find any fault with it. servant maids carried the tea up and took a sip, \u201cIt\u2019s already late, why did you come over at this time?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun also drank a mouthful of tea, and after brewing for a while, he said honestly, \u201cI\u2019m going to Lan Ling tomorrow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was startled, and even forgot to drink his tea.</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t that Lan Ling was a bad place, but that it had been too chaotic recently \u2026 He was from Chiliarch, and since he was going, he must be leading the troops to war. Xie Zhen remained silent for a while and just when she was about to remind him to be careful of everything, Yan Yu had already opened her mouth to ask, \u201cYou came just to say these words?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>He tilted his head, obviously disdaining this.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen could only blame his bad attitude. She pursed her her mouth a thin line and glared at him. He turned to Gao Xun and said, \u201cBig Brother Gao Xun, be careful. I heard that the First Prince is very crafty, so you shouldn\u2019t fall for his trap. \u201cYou have to measure your strength. Don\u2019t push yourself too hard. Your body is the most important\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun responded, \u201cI understand.\u201d</p><br/><p>Actually, he didn\u2019t have much to say. After a few words, he became silent. Mainly because Yan Yu\u2019s eyes were burning hot, and because Xie Zhen knew how Gao Xun felt about her, their conversation wasn\u2019t as comfortable as before.</p><br/><p>Just as she was considering whether she should leave Gao Xun alone for dinner, Gao Xun had already said to Yan Yu: \u201cCan I have a few words with Ah Zhen alone?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu didn\u2019t even think about it, and looked at him, \u201cNo, if there\u2019s anything you want to say, say it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>His lips curled up helplessly, \u201cAh Yu \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s thin lips curled into a line, and stubbornly said, \u201cI\u2019ll say it here.\u201d</p><br/><p>He had no other choice but to look at Xie Zhen again.</p><br/><p>After thinking for a while, he mustered up the courage to ask the question that had been plaguing his mind for a long time, \u201cAh Zhen, if you don\u2019t have Ah Yu \u2026 Will you marry me? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu suddenly glared at him.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He didn\u2019t even need to turn his head to feel the raging fury of the people around him. She thought about this question seriously and nodded her head. I think so. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu tightened his grip on the armrest, blue veins popping out from the back of his hand.</p><br/><p>She continued while looking at Gao Xun with her her mouth a thin line: \u201cBut Big Brother Gao Xun, this hypothesis was not true in the first place. I knew Big Brother Xiao Yu earlier than you, if not for Big Brother Xiao Yu, I wouldn\u2019t have known you too. \u201d She already knew that there would be a day when she would open the topic, so she didn\u2019t panic at all. \u201cWe were so close when we were young, you always made me laugh and play with me. I treated you as my best brother. If I don\u2019t marry Big Brother Xiao Yu, I might really marry you \u2026 But that\u2019s because my father and mother like you, not because I like you \u2026 How could I like my brother? \u201d</p><br/><p>After she finished speaking in a single breath, she practically did not dare look at Yan Yu\u2019s face. Her face was slightly red, and Shui Yingying looked at Gao Xun with watery eyes, \u201cBut big brother Xiao Yu is different \u2026 I was willing to marry him. \u201d After saying that, she bit her pink lips. She was a little embarrassed, \u201cBig Brother Gao Xun, don\u2019t keep thinking about the past. There are actually many beautiful and skilled girls in capital, you \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Before he could finish, he heard the sound of porcelain breaking.</p><br/><p>She raised her head and saw that Gao Xun\u2019s face was pale white, the cup in her hand sliding to the ground.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

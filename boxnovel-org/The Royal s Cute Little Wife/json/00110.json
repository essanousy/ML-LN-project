Just now, the two of them had been quite a distance away, and she was standing in the shade. That was why he couldn\u2019t see anything unusual about her.</p><br/><p>What was going on?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu stared at Shuang Yu coldly, his entire body releasing anger, \u201cWhat happened to her?\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan were shocked too. Just now, they had thought that Xie Zhen\u2019s complexion was not good and had advised her many times to enter the house to rest but she always said that she was fine. The two of them couldn\u2019t force her and thought that she was really alright. They didn\u2019t expect her to faint so heavily \u2026 Both of them looked flustered as they kneeled down to the ground, \u201cYour Highness, please forgive us for not being able to take care of you \u2026. \u201cThe Empress just said that she was dizzy. It must be because she stood there for a long time without any strength left \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not listen to their nonsense, he carried Xie Zhen and walked into the inner courtyard, then said coldly: \u201cGo get a doctor!\u201d</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan stood up, they did not dare delay any further, and immediately called for the doctors.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu carried Xie Zhen and returned to Zhanyue Court. He placed her carefully on the bed and wiped the sweat off her forehead with his sleeves. He lightly called out to her: \u201cLittle Lamb?\u201d</p><br/><p>Unfortunately, Xie Zhen could no longer hear her. No matter what he shouted, she did not react.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu never thought that he would see such a scene upon returning. It had only been two months since he left, how could she have lost so much weight? Did the servant not take good care of her? When he thought of how she had been wronged, his heart ached. He wished that he could call all the servants in the house over to punish them.</p><br/><p>In order to get back to capital from Lan Ling as soon as possible, he hadn\u2019t had a proper rest during the entire journey. Now, he even looked at her helplessly, unwilling to even blink.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu saw that he was extremely haggard, with an obviously extremely exhausted look on his face. He advised him to rest in the side room, but he did not even move.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu did not persuade anymore, and walked out to let everyone see if the doctor had invited anyone.</p><br/><p>After approximately an incense worth of time, a servant maids brought a doctor over hurriedly. The old doctor was panting heavily. Before he could even catch his breath, he had been grabbed by Shuang Yan and brought to the inner room.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu brought the doctor to the bedside and bowed respectfully to Yan Yu: \u201cYour Highness, the doctor is here.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu sat on the side of the bed, without moving, he nodded at the doctor and took Xie Zhen\u2019s wrist out of the bed, \u201cThank you, Doctor.\u201d</p><br/><p>The old doctor knew the identities of the two people. On the way here, the servant maids told him many times, but he didn\u2019t dare to be vague. He sat on the embroidered pier and seriously took Xie Zhen\u2019s pulse. His eyebrows were relaxed, causing Shuang Yu\u2019s heart to jump, afraid that he would say some bad news. Luckily, he managed to reveal a smile in the end and stroked his beard: \u201cPrincess\u2019 veins are flowing smoothly, like beads rolling on a jade plate.\u201d He no longer beat around the bush and bluntly said, \u201cPrincess is having a baby now.\u201d</p><br/><p>When he was trying to make things difficult for, Yan Yu had been staring at him expressionlessly. Now that he had heard his words, he was severely stunned, and after a long while he had not even recovered yet.</p><br/><p>After a long while, he asked hoarsely: \u201cWill you say it again?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor stood up and repeated with a warm smile, \u201cCongratulations, your highness. The princess is already two and a half months pregnant. The household is going to have a baby.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu turned his head and looked at the girl who was sleeping soundly. For a moment, he felt mixed emotions. He was both excited, pleasantly surprised, and in a state of disbelief \u2026 She really had their child. Was he going to be a father?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu turned his head and asked: \u201cWhen will she wake up?\u201d</p><br/><p>The doctor counted with his fingers. \u201cThe reason why Princess Hua-Yang is unconscious is because she\u2019s been overthinking and has a irregular diet. I presume she\u2019ll wake up in the evening with Prince Lu accompanying her.\u201d Not only that, the doctor had also warned him to feed Xie Zhen something after she woke up and take care of her emotions. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time for the princess to give birth, so you should pay more attention to it. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu nodded, took down everything he said, then got the servant maids to give him a diagnosis and send him out.</p><br/><p>After everyone in the room left, Yan Yu carefully looked at Xie Zhen\u2019s face. The fear from before disappeared like smoke and was replaced with endless joy. He placed his hand on her cheek and slowly stroked it, leaning over her forehead, staring at her closely. He didn\u2019t seem to see enough, he only felt that her look was really cute, \u201cAh Zhen, wake up \u2026 \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He wanted to tell her himself, tell her that she had his child in her womb.</p><br/><p>This little fool didn\u2019t even know that she was pregnant? How did she take care of herself? Had she exhausted himself by standing in the courtyard for such a long time?</p><br/><p>Just as the doctor said, just as the sun was about to set, Xie Zhen woke up.</p><br/><p>She woke up hungry.</p><br/><p>She had not eaten since the morning and had cooked a bowl of congee with roses. Under Shuang Yu\u2019s persuasion, she barely managed to drink half a bowl of congee, and had been holding on until now. She slowly opened her eyes and rolled her eyeballs just in time to meet Yan Yu\u2019s eyes who was sitting on the bedside.</p><br/><p>She was stunned and continued to watch without moving.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu had noticed this from the moment she woke up, and had been quietly observing her movements. This girl had a really silly look when she had just woken up, she did not have her usual quick-witted look at all. With a smile, he helped her up from the bed and placed a pillow behind her. \u201cservant maids said that you didn\u2019t eat anything today.</p><br/><p>She honestly nodded, then finally realized that something was wrong and asked Yan Yu, \u201cAm I not waiting for you in the courtyard? \u201cWhy did you come into the house?\u201d</p><br/><p>The kitchen had already prepared dinner. With just a word from Yan Yu, Shuang Yu carried the dinner into the inner room, placed it on the square table beside the bed, and left respectfully. Yan Yu pushed the hair at the side of her hair back from her ears and pinched her earlobes: \u201cYou fainted.\u201d</p><br/><p>She tried recalling it, and finally remembered.</p><br/><p>She had waited for him for a long time, but before she could fall into his embrace, her vision went dark.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu lifted a bowl of mountain medicine, lotus root beef bone soup, scooped a spoonful of it and blew on it to cool it down, before bringing it to her mouth, \u201cDrink some soup first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen felt that it was a little strange, but why was it strange she couldn\u2019t tell. She stared at him from left to right for a long time, but she still couldn\u2019t see any flaws. Why did he suddenly become so gentle? He treated her as if she were a treasure, completely different from how he used to be! She took a slow sip of the soup and blinked. \u201cWhy did I faint?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu scooped another spoonful and pursed his lips slightly, slowly raising them higher and higher, \u201cAfter you finish eating this bowl of soup, I\u2019ll tell you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Weird.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen looked at him suspiciously. She had never seen him keep an eye on things before. However, if he thought about it now, it was not an urgent matter, otherwise, he would not be so leisurely. Therefore, Xie Zhen did not take it to heart. She obediently drank a bowl of beef bone soup with his hands. Her appetite was not bad, and she also ate two pieces of radish cake and a few dishes. She wiped her mouth in satisfaction and tilted her head to look at Yan Yu: \u201cCan you tell me now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu placed the bowl and chopsticks back onto the square table, gently holding her hand, he crawled under the blanket.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not understand, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t explain. He held her hand and put it on her belly. His voice was filled with an unconcealable joy. \u201cThere\u2019s a little lamb here.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was stunned, she blinked her eyes, then blinked her eyes again. She only felt that the skin beneath her palms was exceptionally hot. With a layer of clothing covering her skin, she could feel the temperature of her stomach, which was hotter than ever before.</p><br/><p>She stuttered, unable to speak quickly. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>At the critical moment, his brain became stupid.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu curved her lips into a smile. Her exquisite and cold face was bright and gentle, making people unable to help themselves from staring, \u201cThat\u2019s what it means.\u201d He stopped teasing her and used his other hand to rub her nose, with a look of boundless love. \u201cLittle Lamb has my child now, and you will be mine for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s mouth slightly opened, as she was still immersed in the shock he brought.</p><br/><p>She had never thought that it would come so suddenly. She hadn\u2019t been prepared at all, so how could she suddenly have a child? No wonder she felt drowsy and ate less than before. Was it related to this? The more she thought about it, the more incredulous she felt. She pulled away the quilt and lowered her head to observe her stomach which had yet to bulge. Was there really a tiny life here?</p><br/><p>She looked up as if to confirm: \u201cAre you sure? Has the doctor seen it? When did it happen? How come I didn\u2019t know? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu sat beside her and embraced her whole body. His chin was pressed against the top of her head as he patiently replied every question, \u201cI\u2019ve seen the doctor, there\u2019s no mistake. It\u2019s already been two months and you\u2019re not interested in yourself at all. If you didn\u2019t suddenly faint, who knows how long you would have been unconscious for. \u201d</p><br/><p>Only then did Xie Zhen have a sense of realism. His almond eyes shone like bright stars in the night sky. She turned her head suddenly and looked up into his eyes, a smile on her lips. Stupid.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu kissed the tip of her nose. \u201cWhat are you laughing at?\u201d</p><br/><p>She lowered her head into his arms and carefully protected her stomach. \u201cI\u2019m so happy!\u201d</p><br/><p>Previously, when Yan Yu said that he wanted her to give him a child, she said that she didn\u2019t agree. However, when this child truly arrived, she couldn\u2019t help but be overjoyed. She was both happy and frightened, because she had never been a mother and did not know what to do, afraid that she would not do it well. But if she was willing to learn, it wouldn\u2019t be a difficult matter. Didn\u2019t Mother give birth to her at that time?</p><br/><p>With this thought, she looked forward to the arrival of this child even more.</p><br/><p>What would she and Yan Yu\u2019s child look like?</p><br/><p>Like her or like him?</p><br/><p>She let her imagination run wild, and threw Yan Yu to the side.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu held her arm tightly and asked unhappily: \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Without hiding anything, she pulled herself up and wrapped her arms around his neck, level with him, her eyes curved like crescent moons. \u201cI was wondering what our child would be like, like you or like me?\u201d Then he thought for a moment and came to a conclusion, \u201cIt\u2019s better to be like me. You have a weird temper, so I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not very cute.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu pursed her lips, \u201cIf he\u2019s a son, then he\u2019s definitely going to be like me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was unhappy. She pouted and retorted confidently, \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about being like you? You were like a little girl when you were a little girl! \u201d</p><br/><p>This sentence undoubtedly pierced Yan Yu\u2019s sore spot. He glared at her, if not for the fact that she was pregnant, he really wanted to press her down on the bed to confirm just how much of a girl he was.</p><br/><p>Seeing that he was angry, Xie Zhen laughed and peck him on his lips, saying: \u201cThat\u2019s because Big Brother Xiao Yu is beautiful, I like beautiful people!\u201d</p><br/><p>He snorted. \u201cShallow.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t mind in the slightest. Instead, she boldly said, \u201cYou said that you liked me, and I\u2019m also beautiful. Then, are you also superficial?\u201d</p><br/><p>He was actually unable to refute her words.</p><br/><p>In terms of logic, Yan Yu could never compare to Xie Zhen. Fortunately, he had long since learned to be smart. He didn\u2019t bother with her and just let her ask for a verbal bargain. She would be happy.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen continued to think about who the child should be like in the future. In the end, she concluded that the eyes and nose should be like Yan Yu, and the mouth should be like her.</p><br/><p>However, each of them was more good-looking than the other, so the children they gave birth to would definitely not be any worse off.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

Just to be safe, she didn\u2019t even embroider her name onto the handkerchief.</p><br/><p>She hoped nothing will happen.</p><br/><p>As for Li Yu, how did he know that she had lost a handkerchief?</p><br/><p>On the one hand, Xie Zhen was worried. On the other hand, she wanted to know the whereabouts of Auntie Song, so she told Xie Rong about it and asked him to help investigate Li Yu.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong did not know that this person was in the capital. He asked casually, \u201cWhen did you meet him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen pursed her lips, dipped her head, and scratched her fingernails. \u201cI met him by chance at the Mingqiu Lakeside.\u201d</p><br/><p>These words were half true, half false. Actually, it was not by chance. She didn\u2019t know how long Li Yu had been hiding there before he suddenly caught her.</p><br/><p>This small detail wasn\u2019t too bad. Xie Rong looked at her and called her by her nickname, \u201cWhy do you only speak now?\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked up, unable to find a suitable excuse, so only pretended to be good, \u201cLast time there were so many people, I couldn\u2019t find a chance to speak. After I returned home, I forgot about it. I didn\u2019t remember it until today!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong didn\u2019t say anything. He clearly didn\u2019t believe that she would really forget.</p><br/><p>She also knew that the reason was not good. She leaned out from the square table, took a cup of tea and looked at him, \u201cBig brother, can you help me ask around?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong didn\u2019t answer. Calmly, he asked, \u201cWhy do you want to know where he is?\u201d</p><br/><p>She choked, wondering was there any other reason.</p><br/><p>It was just that she wanted to know!</p><br/><p>If she told Xie Rong this, he probably wouldn\u2019t agree. Thus, she racked her brains for a moment before an idea struck her. \u201cI don\u2019t want to know where he is, I want to know where Auntie Song is.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAuntie Song used to be so nice to us. I want to know how she\u2019s doing. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong was barely able to accept this reason. If it was for Li Yu, he wouldn\u2019t agree to Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>He had never liked that kid since he was young, and he wondered if he was still the same as before when he grew up.</p><br/><p>Noticing that he was loosening up, Xie Zhen struck the iron while it was hot, lifted the tea-cover and sent the tea forward, her face beaming with a bright smile. \u201cBig brother, will you drink it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAfter this cup of tea, you would do what I asked. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong smiled helplessly as he took a sip from the teacup.</p><br/><p>Delighted, she hopped around the room, then came up to him, took a sip of hot tea from his hand, and pursed her pink lips. Her eyes were like crescent moons.</p><br/><p>She probably didn\u2019t know why she was so happy. It was probably because she was about to meet Auntie Song.</p><br/><p>She definitely wouldn\u2019t admit that it was because of Li Yu. After all, they had only had an argument during the day. He was so fierce, so she didn\u2019t want to get along with him.</p><br/><p>Finding people in the capital wasn\u2019t a difficult matter. Every person who went in and out of the capital had to show up for a public trial, and every day there was a record of it.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong used his connections and coincidentally, he knew Zhao Jin, the youngest son of capital mayor, very well. So, he asked Zhao Jin to help him find out if there was a business owner named Li Xiqing in the capital, and his wife, Madame Song, and they had a son named Li Yu.</p><br/><p>However, a few days later, Zhao Jin told him that there was no such family and asked him if he remembered the wrong person.</p><br/><p>capital were many people called Li Xiqing in the capital, but none of them were the same as what he described.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong thought for a moment, then asked him to investigate Li Yu see if there was anyone like Li Yu.</p><br/><p>Zhao Jin told him, \u201cYes, there are, but there are a total of twenty-seven people. May I know which one you are referring to?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOr shall I take them here one by one for you to check? \u201d</p><br/><p>In the end, Xie Rong didn\u2019t actually ask him to bring them over. Instead, he followed him to look at them one by one.</p><br/><p>The names were all the same, but they all had different appearances, none of them were Li Yu, whom Xie Rong knew.</p><br/><p>After seeing the last person, he went home with Zhao Jin, and told Xie Zhen about it.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was disappointed. How come he couldn\u2019t find it?</p><br/><p>They had met each other several times!</p><br/><p>What was he doing in the capital?</p><br/><p>Why not tell her?</p><br/><p>Half a month had passed without her realizing it. Nothing had happened to the crown prince\u2019s residence, and she had never seen Li Yu again.</p><br/><p>The days were calmer than she had imagined. She gradually calmed down. It seemed that she had been thinking too much last time. Perhaps the Crown Princess had only wanted them to compete in embroidery?</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing had been at home for a month.</p><br/><p>Initially, he would still be worried, but now he gradually calmed down.</p><br/><p>Since His Majesty wasn\u2019t going to give him an official position, there was no point in him panicking. He might as well wait calmly at home. There would be news sooner or later.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng said he threw the handle after the blade, but he did not think so, and explained: \u201cI can\u2019t change anything even if I am anxious, I might as well reflect at home and reflect on the wrong things that I have done in the past few years. It will be clear to me in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThere won\u2019t be a day like this in the future.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng put a plate of pastries on the table and poured him another glass of Blue Spring. \u201cDon\u2019t you want to think of a way out?\u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled. \u201cI\u2019ve thought of everything I should think of. The time has come. What should come will eventually come.\u201d</p><br/><p>Contrary to his optimism, Madam Leng had no choice but to consider more. \u201cWhat if we have to wait for another seven or eight years?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cAll three children are growing up, so you have to pay for everything they eat and wear. You don\u2019t have a salary, so we can\u2019t just sit around and eat.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing stopped drinking tea and placed the teacup back on the table, \u201cWhere\u2019s the silver we brought back from Qing Zhou?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIs it not enough?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cThat\u2019s enough, but not much.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng said, after returning to capital, they spent more money on all sorts of things than in Qingzhou. In addition, they didn\u2019t earn much, so the money they saved up was quickly used up.</p><br/><p>Now that it was summer, they were going to buy summer clothes and other things, and doing something even more important. \u201cRong\u2019er has grown up. He has reached the age of marriage.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cEven proposing a marriage contract requires money. We should think of ways to prevent this from delaying our child\u2019s marriage.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing finally realized that the situation was serious. He stood up and walked around, discussing countermeasures with Madam Leng.</p><br/><p>A little girl in a pinkish white dress sat on the veranda outside, her hands on her cheeks, looking at the roses in the yard with a wistful expression.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was here to get Madam Leng. Hearing her conversation with Xie Liqing, she couldn\u2019t help but be curious and stood outside to listen for a while.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t expect it to be such a heavy topic. She let out a sigh, and for the first time, she experienced what it was like to have no money.</p><br/><p>In the past, they were very wealthy in Qing Zhou. They got whatever they wanted. Who knew that after arriving in the capital, they would even worry about money.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

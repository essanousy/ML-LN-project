Thankfully her little sister hadn\u2019t actually gotten injured, otherwise she would have immediately burst into tears.</p><br/><p>She turned her head, and her dark round eyes glared at Gao Tongtong angrily.</p><br/><p>Gao Tongtong guiltily looked back at her, before her eyes turned to Xie Rong, and not knowing where to put her hands, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t do it on purpose\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong expressionlessly asked, \u201cWhat exactly did Xie Xun do wrong to provoke Second Miss Gao\u2019s displeasure?\u201d</p><br/><p>If he hadn\u2019t come at that exact moment, Xie Xun would have struck the fake mountain. She was only three years old, if something had happened to her, how would he explain it to his parents? Only such a poisonous and cruel person would actually harm such a small child.</p><br/><p>Gao Tongtong had finally found him after so long, yet she\u2019d never thought that they would meet like that.</p><br/><p>As she was already eight years-old, she already knew quite a bit.</p><br/><p>She started to regret her earlier actions; if she\u2019d known that he was coming earlier, she would\u2019ve been nicer to Xie Xun\u2026Afraid that her standing would drop in his eyes, she immediately started making excuses, saying, \u201cShe wanted to see my hairpin, but this was the birthday present that Gao Xun gave to me. I was afraid that she would break it, so I didn\u2019t let her see\u2026Later on she wanted to snatch it away, so I accidentally pushed her\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Although Xie Xun was still crying, her ears were still sensitive, and hearing this she immediately raised her head, saying, \u201cBig brother I didn\u2019t snatch it, I didn\u2019t\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong looked to her, and used his hand to gently wipe away her tears, asking, \u201cYou wanted her hairpin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun\u2019s face was full of tears and snot as she nodded, face full of grievances.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong didn\u2019t mean to blame her one bit, and gently patted her little bun, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing, tomorrow Big Brother will get a prettier one for you. Ah Xun already is pretty, so you should have an even prettier hairpin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The underlying meaning of his words was that Gao Tongtong\u2019s hairpin didn\u2019t look good enough.</p><br/><p>Gao Tongtong flushed, his words were even more humiliating than a direct admonishment. She immediately felt embarrassed, before she\u2019d dressed up so well, yet he hadn\u2019t even taken a second glance at her.</p><br/><p>After he\u2019d comforted Xie Xun, Xie Rong looked at her again, his expression returning to his usual peaceful one. \u201cThis is Xie <em>fu</em>, and this is Ah Xun\u2019s house, since Second Miss Gao came as a guest, you should follow proper etiquette. If you don\u2019t know this, then you shouldn\u2019t come next time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Despite his young age, Xie Rong was extremely protective of his younger sisters. They were his two baby sisters, if any short-sighted person bullied them, then he wouldn\u2019t be polite.</p><br/><p>Gao Tongtong was a prime example of this. She\u2019d been excessively spoiled by her family, and there\u2019d been numerous people who fell at her feet. After being scolded so harshly, her anger and humiliation lead to her spitting out one sentence. \u201cWhat\u2019s so good about coming, if I can\u2019t come then I won\u2019t come!\u201d</p><br/><p>Saying this she tossed her head back and ran out of the courtyard.</p><br/><p>From afar the two children playing on the swings saw their sister running, and didn\u2019t think much about it, continuing to play.</p><br/><p>Having witnessed the entire scene play out, Gao Xun apologised on behalf of his sister, saying, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, when I go back home I\u2019ll report this to my family elders so that they can talk to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Rong didn\u2019t reply, and carried Xie Xun outside. As he turned around he said to Xie Zhen, \u201cI\u2019ll bring Xie Xun home first, Little Lamb, you should also be careful not to hurt yourself.\u201d</p><br/><p>His words not only cautioned her but also warned Gao Xun.</p><br/><p>Nodding her head, Xie Zhen sent her siblings out.</p><br/><p>Having experienced that, Xie Zhen and Gao Xun both didn\u2019t feel like playing anymore, and the two sat beside the pond melancholy.</p><br/><p>Reaching her hand out, Xie Xun prodded Big Qiansui\u2019s head, and it immediately retreated back into its shell.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun asked her, \u201cWhy exactly did Ah Xun insist on looking at Big Sister\u2019s hairpin?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stiffened, and looked around like a thief. Seeing that nobody was close by, she then quietly said, \u201cYou cannot tell anyone else about this.\u201d</p><br/><p>Did she want to share a secret with him? Having received this unexpected favour, Gao Xun was stunned as he replied, \u201cOf course!\u201d</p><br/><p>As such Xie Zhen leaned close to his ear, and quietly told him the whole truth, before guiltily looking down. \u201cThat\u2019s why I wanted to buy another one for Ah Niang.\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun showed an expression of realisation, no wonder the two were so focused on Gao Tongtong\u2019s hairpin\u2026</p><br/><p>Patting his chest like a man, he assured her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll definitely find the exact same one for you!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen laughed at this, making Gao Xun so delighted he felt as though he was floating.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>After giving the Gao family her farewells, Leng <em>shi</em> returned to the room, and with just a glimpse she could tell that someone had touched her dressing table.</p><br/><p>Calling Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan over, she then realised that it was some strange plan concocted by the two troublemakers Xie Zhen and Xie Xun. Originally she wanted to call them over and ask what had happened, but the pair of them were extremely secretive, as though they were afraid of others finding out what they\u2019d done, and it seemed as though the words \u201cI\u2019ve done something wrong\u201d were written all over their faces.</p><br/><p>Looking at the two reluctant troublemakers in front of her, Leng <em>shi</em> already had a premonition in her heart, and she changed her attitude. \u201cI heard today Ah Xun was treated unfairly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun used that opportunity to complain. \u201cAh Niang, Big Sister Gao Tong pushed me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng <em>shi </em>patted her head gently and asked, \u201cWhy did she push you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun shyly replied, \u201cBecause I wanted to take a closer look at her hairpin\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng <em>shi</em> lifted her up onto her thighs, and earnestly admonished her, \u201cNext time if you want something, Ah Niang will get it for you. You don\u2019t need to envy other people, alright? You also can\u2019t recklessly take other peoples\u2019 things, let today\u2019s events be a lesson for you, so that next time you\u2019ll remember not to do this again.\u2019</p><br/><p>The two troublemakers obediently nodded their heads.</p><br/><p>Leng <em>shi</em> was not poor, in terms of clothing and good food, she had never scrimped with regards to her two daughters. Even then the household was also quite well-off, and coupled with Leng <em>shi\u2019s</em> habit of spoiling her two daughters, it wasn\u2019t hard to imagine that her two daughters had been brought up to look pretty and put together.</p><br/><p>Although she was admonishing them, internally Leng <em>shi</em> was thinking of something else. Since the second young miss of the Gao family was difficult to get along with, she should let her two daughters interact with her less in the future.</p><br/><p>Seeing that their mother wasn\u2019t angry, and didn\u2019t look as though she\u2019d found out about her missing hairpin, Xie Zhen hesitated a little before saying, \u201cAh Niang, tomorrow I want to go out with Gao Xun, is that alright?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng <em>shi</em> didn\u2019t even have to think about it before she replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen let out a disappointed noise, and clinging to her mother\u2019s thigh she raised her round face to look at her. \u201cWhy not? Why, why?\u201d</p><br/><p>She looked very adorable, and Leng <em>shi</em> gently pinched her nose before saying, \u201cTomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival, so of course you have to stay at home and celebrate.\u201d</p><br/><p>The Mid-Autumn Festival was a day to celebrate together, so they should eat mooncakes as a family. Why should she go out to the streets and celebrate? Leng <em>shi</em> disapproved.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had already made plans to meet up with Gao Xun, and she couldn\u2019t fail at this point, so she tried and tried until tears finally appeared in her eyes, and she used everything she had to convince her mother. \u201cI\u2019ll only go out for a while; I\u2019ll definitely be able to return before dinner\u2026Ah Niang, please just let me go this once, why don\u2019t you let me out for a while? I swear I\u2019ll be good from now on!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng <em>shi</em> almost relented, but she caught herself and harshly rejected her.</p><br/><p>Just as Xie Zhen was close to giving up, Xie Liqing returned and said he would bring XIe Rong out the next day. As the weather was getting colder, it was a good time to give the children some more winter clothes. Xie Zhen immediately saw the thin strand of opportunity and clung onto it, pestering Xie Liqing to let her go along.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing was soft-hearted, and she only needed to try for a while before he agreed.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen happily hugged his thigh, saying, \u201cDaddy\u2019s so nice, Daddy\u2019s nicer than Ah Niang!\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng <em>shi</em> could only watch on helplessly.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>On the day of the Mid-Autumn Festival, Xie Zhen woke up especially early.</p><br/><p>The night before it had rained, and it was colder than normal, so she found an embroidered jacket to put on, and paired it with a green skirt. Once Shuang Yu helped her wash up and comb her hair, she happily bounced towards the main hall. Before going in, she suddenly heard Gao Xun\u2019s voice coming from inside.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun had actually woken up even earlier than her, and had constantly been thinking of their meeting today, so even before dawn he\u2019d already run over to Xie <em>fu.</em></p><br/><p>\u201cI brought seven to eight servants, they\u2019ll definitely be able to protect Xie Zhen,\u201d He said to Xie Liqing and Xie Rong.</p><br/><p>Xie Rong was silent for a moment, before unhesitatingly rejecting him, \u201cNo way.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter the number of people he brought over, he was so small and skinny, if something happened how would he be able to protect his little sister?</p><br/><p>Unable to convince Xie Rong, Gao Xun turned over to Xie Liqing, pleading, \u201cUncle Xie, please believe me\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing snorted a little, he had similar thoughts to his son, and likewise wasn\u2019t too agreeable. \u201cIt so happens that both of us are also going out, if you don\u2019t mind, we can go with both of you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun was quite disappointed; he\u2019d assumed that he would be able to go alone with Xie Zhen that day. He already had to bring Li Yu along, but now her father and brother wanted to accompany them? He deliberated over it for a while before saying, \u201cWhere does Uncle Xie want to go? I\u2019ll set a time to meet all of you there. I promised Xie Zhen to buy some hairpins for her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing then informed him of their plans for the day, and only after that did he leave.</p><br/><p>Seeing Gao Xun leaving, Xie Zhen entered the main hall, asking, \u201cDaddy, why did Gao Xun leave?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing laughed as he carried her, saying, \u201cYoung Master Gao wanted to bring you out, but Daddy rejected him. He said that he wanted to bring you to buy some hairpins, Little Lamb, you want some more hairpins?\u201d</p><br/><p>That rascal Gao Xun, how could he just blurt everything out?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was angry, but at the same time, afraid that she would be found out, she lied a little, \u201cAh Xun liked Gao Tongtong\u2019s hairpin, so I wanted to buy it and give it to her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her lie was quite good, and Xie Liqing didn\u2019t ask any further questions as he led Xie Rong and her out of the house.</p><br/><p>The Gao family\u2019s carriage had stopped right outside Li <em>fu</em>, and Gao Xun stared unblinkingly as she went out with her father and brother. She\u2019d even waved at him!</p><br/><p>Gao Xun kicked a little at the ground, wondering why Li Yu hadn\u2019t come out yet\u2026If he still didn\u2019t come, then he would follow Xie Zhen!</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>The Mid-Autumn Festival was a popular one, and the streets were incredibly busy. People were coming and going, and many were yelling loudly. The wide variety of dazzling shops made one unable to look away.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen followed her father to the tailor, and also helped pick four nice fabrics that he mother liked. For her sister and herself, she picked out two pieces. Despite her young age, her choices were very unique and good, and the colours she\u2019d picked out were endlessly praised by the shopkeepers.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing then brought the two siblings to a nearby bookstore to buy some books, and in the blink of an eye, two hours had passed.</p><br/><p>The three were at a teashop drinking and chatting when a servant from the Gao family came over and said, \u201cThis Lord, my family\u2019s Young Master is already waiting for you downstairs. Could the Second Miss come down for a while?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing was still quite worried, but he couldn\u2019t outright reject him as he was afraid he would accidentally upset the children, so he carried Xie Zhen and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go down as well.\u201d</p><br/><p>Downstairs, Gao Xun had the driver stop the carriage by the road.</p><br/><p>Inside the carriage, Li Yu was confused as he asked, \u201cWhy are we stopping here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Gao Xun laughed mysteriously and said, \u201cWe\u2019re waiting for someone.\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t mind it too much, and instead raised the curtains to look outside, and coincidentally saw Xie Liqing carrying Xie Zhen to walk down.</p><br/><p>The warm and gentle sunlight shone on Xie Zhen\u2019s tender face, and she was smiling happily, looking both adorable and evil at the same time.</p><br/><p>Translator\u2019s Comments:</p><br/><p>One uber-long chapter!

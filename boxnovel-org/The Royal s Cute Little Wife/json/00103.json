They were so fast that the Emperor Yuan Hui did not even have time to react.</p><br/><p>Yan Yun had been recruiting and preparing for the army for a long time. He had three thousand picked troops as well as two hundred thousand soldiers. Gao Yang\u2019s citizens were in a state of panic. When the news reached capital, the officials who had were in the imperial court for a long time were all terrified and shocked. They all suggested that the Emperor Yuan Hui send someone to war with the First Prince.</p><br/><p>Emperor Yuan Hui felt under the weather, and now he was angered by the First Prince so much that he laid on the bed, cursing about the \u201cunfilial son\u201d.</p><br/><p>When he punished Yan Yun, he had cared about the bond between a father and son, so the punishment on Yan Yun was not too much. He expected that this son would thoroughly reform himself when he thought about it in the future. What was unexpected was that he still did not understand this son. Yan Yun\u2019s wolf ambitions were already made clear, but he had extravagantly hoped that a wolf could turn break away from evil ways and return to the orthodox path. Now, he was bitten back by his son, causing the entire Da Jing to fall into a state of panic.</p><br/><p>He gritted his teeth and called the crown prince over along with General of Agile Cavalry, \u201cImmediately dispatch a hundred thousand soldiers to Gao Yang to capture this traitor, regardless of his life or death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Tao and Zhong Kai knelt on the ground and solemnly accepted the order: \u201cI will listen to the imperial edict!\u201d</p><br/><p>In Gao Yang, on the other hand, Yan Yun did not know what the Emperor Yuan Hui was thinking.</p><br/><p>He believed that the throne should have belonged to him, and now he was just taking back what he owned. What was wrong with that? \u201d His army had just taken down Linyi, so the next step was Lan Ling. Sooner or later, he would attack the capital and occupy the palace. He was ambitious, and he and his subordinates deployed a thorough plan to launch an attack on Lanling the next day.</p><br/><p>Lan Ling was an important place in the Da Jing. It connected in all directions and was extremely prosperous with hundreds of thousands of troops stationed here. If they could take down this place, it would be equivalent to having succeeded in half. Yan Yun valued this battle greatly, he wanted his men to capture this town within three months. If anyone succeeded, they would be bestowed the title of the Great General of the Kingdom in the future.</p><br/><p>When these words were spoken, everyone was encouraged.</p><br/><p>However, in Orchid Fragrance City, City Lord Gao Yuan and General Lee Thorn had guarded the city gate with their lives, leading their troops to set up bows and boulders at the city walls, firmly defending Yan Yun\u2019s army outside of the city gates. In just 10 short days, Yan Yun had lost more than a thousand soldiers.</p><br/><p>In Orchid Ridge City, the commoners all knew that the First Prince was about to rebel. All of them were terrified and uneasy. Fortunately, Gao Yuan had his men personally go and pacify the civilians, telling them to stay in the city temporarily and not panic. Only then did everyone finally manage to calm down.</p><br/><p>By the time the crown prince and the General of Agile Cavalry had led a hundred thousand troops to Orchid Mountain City, Gao Yuan and Richard had already guarded the city with their lives for a month.</p><br/><p>Fortunately, he had managed to get them to come.</p><br/><p>In addition to the 100,000 soldiers, the Crown Prince had also brought food and supplies, enough for everyone to stay in the city for another month. Gao Yuan and Li Sheng solemnly received them. They analyzed the current situation to the two of them, pointed at the tiger skin map on the table and said, \u201cYan Yun\u2019s army is stationed on a hillside five kilometers away, led by General Dingyuan Xu Jin. He did everything he could to achieve his goal, and previously, in order to break the city wall, he sent one soldier after another to their deaths \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Now that Yan Yun had become the leader of the rebel army, it disrupted the citizens\u2019 livelihood. The people of Da Jing hated him to the bones, and never respected him again as the First Prince.</p><br/><p>After the Crown Prince heard this, he pondered for a moment. The four of them sat together and discussed their plans for the future.</p><br/><p>In the capital, although Yan Yu did not head towards the Lanling Mountains, he was busy night and day. He would either enter the palace to discuss tactics with the various ministers, or go to the barracks, and would only return very late every day. There were several times that he came back and Xie Zhen had already fallen asleep. He couldn\u2019t bear to disturb her, so after washing his face and rinsing his mouth, he slept beside her quietly and took her into his arms.</p><br/><p>Although his movements were light, Xie Zhen was still unavoidably woken up. She didn\u2019t even open her eyes, and subconsciously burrowed into his embrace, extending her arms to hug his neck, \u201cWhy is Big Brother Xiao Yu back so late again?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu patted her back, letting her continue sleeping, \u201cThere are a lot of things going on in the palace.</p><br/><p>She was very clear about what had happened in the past few days. Although Yan Yu did not tell her, but the news had spread very fast. The First Prince was rebelling at Gao Yang and had recently sent troops to attack Lanling. Not only was the people of Orchid Fragrance City suffering, even the citizens of the capital were anxious, afraid that one day disaster would befall them. The crown prince and the General of Agile Cavalry had already headed to Orchid Tomb and had ordered to capture Yan Yun. They did not know what the situation was like and were afraid that it would not be that simple.</p><br/><p>If Lan Ling City were to succeed, then the entire Da Jing would fall into a state of panic.</p><br/><p>At that time, the capital would no longer be peaceful.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen opened his tired eyes, which were clouded with a layer of mist. He asked in a sleepy voice, \u201cWere you angered by the First Prince? How\u2019s the situation at Lan Ling? Do you want to go as well? \u201d</p><br/><p>This was what she was most worried about. If the crown prince and the General of Agile Cavalry could not defend it, would she still send Yan Yu there?</p><br/><p>She knew it was inevitable, but she still didn\u2019t want him to go.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu lowered his head and met her eyes, gently stroking her eyes with his hands. In the silent night, his voice had a heavy and gentle tone, \u201cHe was established as a king in Gao Yang, and when father mentioned him, he got angry. He had to use medicine every day to sleep. If second brother is unable to protect Lan Ling, sooner or later, I will have to go. \u201d</p><br/><p>Look, she was right.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t speak for a long time, he kept his head buried in Yun Che\u2019s chest for a long time before finally clenching his teeth and saying, \u201cYan Yun is really crazy \u2026 Even if he were to rely on this method to ascend to the throne, does he think that the people of the world would submit to him? \u201d After she said that, she raised her wet eyes and said pitifully, \u201cI don\u2019t want Big Brother Xiao Yu to go to Lanling.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was too dangerous. She was afraid something might happen to him. The previous two times he went to the border trials, he had narrowly escaped death and returned safely. The situation this time was different, his hands and feet were maimed, what if he was unable to bear it and got ambushed by Yan Yun?</p><br/><p>Being stared by such a pair of eyes caused Yan Yu\u2019s heart to soften. He consoled her, \u201cEverything has not been settled yet.</p><br/><p>Actually he still hadn\u2019t said the first half of the sentence, but Yan Yun had indeed gone mad. For the sake of the throne, he had already entered a trance-like state, and his entire being had become delirious. It was easy for such a person to have weaknesses. If the crown prince could grasp at his weaknesses, then defeating him wouldn\u2019t be a difficult task.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu believed in Yan Tao\u2019s ability.</p><br/><p>Although Yan Tao was warm, he was not a simple person at all. He was not as calm as he looked, otherwise he would not have been sitting in the crown prince\u2019s position the entire time. He had his own methods and opinions. He was a person that could not be underestimated.</p><br/><p>After Xie Zhen heard this, he lowered his eyes, \u201cWhat if the crown prince can\u2019t protect it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu smoothed out the wrinkles on her forehead, \u201cThen I can only accept your challenge. Rest assured, I will send you to a safe place, and this time there will be no more accidents. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen pinched the flesh on his waist, \u201c\u2026 That\u2019s not what I meant! \u201d</p><br/><p>She was worried about him, he knew.</p><br/><p>He endured the pain and laughed, saying, \u201cThen I\u2019ll just hide you in my sleeve and bring you to the battlefield with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s eyes lit up, even though he knew it was impossible, he still raised up his pinky finger and held it in front of him, \u201cThen let\u2019s pull the hook, is the one who lied little dog?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu hesitated for a while, then reached out his pinky to pull the hook with her, and lightly sealed it.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was relieved, and went back to his arms to sleep.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

{"title": "Chapter 3", "id": 3, "volume": 1, "url": "http://boxnovel.org/the-royals-cute-little-wife-chapter-3", "volume_title": "Volume 1", "body": "<h1>Chapter 3</h1>\n<div class=\"chr-c\" id=\"chr-content\" style=\"font-family: Minion, serif, serif; font-size: 18px; line-height: 160%;\">\n<p>3.1</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Liyu hadn\u2019t lied, he was, in fact, a boy.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Their ages weren\u2019t that far apart, as he was only older than Xie Zhen by half a year. But because he had been a sickly child since young, coupled with the fact that boys developed later than girls, he wasn\u2019t as tall as Xie Zhen. It was no wonder that Xie Zhen had wanted to call him little sister when she first saw him\u2026</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">After the truth was revealed, the atmosphere between both of them became rather awkward.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">After all, Xie Zhen was still a child. After carelessly groping him, she did feel sorry and put her hands behind her back saying, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me, who asked you to look so pretty\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">It hadn\u2019t been easy for Li Yu\u2019s complexion to go back to normal, but after hearing her words, his face once again turned green,</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">\u201cBut you still shouldn\u2019t have\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Speaking midway, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to finish his sentence.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">He had come with Song <em>shi</em> as a guest, but feeling bored after sitting in the main hall for half an hour, he had wished to go to the toilet, and so followed the maidservant out of the hall. Unexpectedly, as soon as he walked out, he bumped into this unreasonable stinky girl.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Although Xie Zhen had been in the wrong, she was used to acting coquettishly and pretending to be innocent to get out of trouble. She went up and grabbed Li Yu\u2019s hand, smiling and saying, \u201cDon\u2019t be angry, why not I sing a song for you?\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Her soft voice, coupled with her sweet smiling face, made Li Yu suddenly realise that she actually looked rather cute. Soon after, he snorted mentally, what\u2019s the point of looking cute, after all, she\u2019d still groped him!</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Seeing that he didn\u2019t reject her offer, Xie Zhen enthusiastically pulled him to down to the porch, and clearing her throat she began to sing: \u201cWhite pea, I\u2019m here again, I\u2019ll stay until the fire wood is chopped\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">This was something she learnt on the way to Qing Zhou. There had been a group of children amongst the crowd on the streets. At that time, they\u2019d been singing this song and Xie Zhen had remembered it immediately. Her voice was soft and pleasant sounding. Despite being brought up in the capital, her voice was better sounding than girls in the south.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Li Yu\u2019s arm was still being pulled on by her. He was still unwilling to follow her, having had a bad impression of her.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Just then, he carefully looked at her face and caught her shining black eyes looking at him steadily. His face immediately reddened and he turned his head away.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">\u201cWhere are you planning to go? Towards the river, where there are loaches.\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">The cooling wind breezed through the hall, bringing with it the smell of Iris petals from the yard, along with a whiff of sweet milk. Li Yu\u2019s neck was stiff and he had no choice but to turn his head once again. With a glance he saw her gazing intently at the irises in the yard. Her face was as fair as a freshly peeled boiled egg, different from other girls he had seen before. The other girls had not been as good-looking as her, her skin was sparkling and clear, soft, white and with no flaws.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">She was good-looking, and that was a fact, it was just that she was a little not right in the head.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Feeling a pressure in his lower abdomen, Liyu suddenly remembered the purpose of him coming out. Wanting to push lightly away her hand, he pleaded, \u201cI want to go\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\"> Xie zhen didn\u2019t let go of him, anxiously saying, \u201cWait a moment, I haven\u2019t finished singing the song.\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Having been interrupted earlier, she wanted to continue singing.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Liyu really wanted to cry. Even though she sang well, he was really in a hurry!</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">He struggled for a while, but because he had just recovered, he didn\u2019t have much strength, so he finally was unable to forcefully break free from her claws.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Seeing this, the two maidservants at each side also felt conflicted. Both of these kids were the household\u2019s little ancestors, and both couldn\u2019t be offended, causing them to be in a dilemma.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Finally, Liyu\u2019s maidservant went forward and said, \u201cSecond miss, our young master\u2026\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">But she still said these words a bit too late, at this time, Liyu could hold on for no longer.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Before Xie Zhen could react to what was happening, Liyu in one movement pushed her away due to his embarrassment, and angrily exclaimed, \u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Caught off-guard, Xie Zhen was forced back a few steps.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">If not for Shuang Yu catching hold of her from the back, Xie Zhen would have fallen to the ground.</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Seeing Liyu turning and leaving, Xie Zhen looked up at Shuang Yu, confused, and asked, \u201cWhy is he so angry?\u201d</p><p class=\"gmail-MsoNormal\">Shuang Yu sighed, even children had their own self-respect, and with just a glance one could tell that Li Yu was the kind of prideful and dignified child, so it was better if she helped cover up for him. \u201cYoung Master Li probably doesn\u2019t like listening to music.\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xie Zhen nodded, deep in thought. If he didn\u2019t like it then it was fine, but shouldn\u2019t he have just told her so?</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t like her singing ability was that bad.</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>At the main hall, Li Yu had returned, his face pale.</p><br/><p>The moment Song <em>shi </em>caught sight of him looking like that, she was stunned. Why did his facial expression look so unsightly? Hurriedly she asked the maidservants what had happened before, and as Leng <em>shi </em>was also there, the maidservant could only stutter unclearly, \u201cThe Young Master met Second Young Miss Xie\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu looked at her, and quietly told her to stop talking.</p><br/><p>Immediately, she stopped.</p><br/><p>In front of Song <em>shi, </em>he looked down and said, \u201cAh Niang, let\u2019s go home, I\u2019m not feeling very good.\u201d</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, as soon as he left their house it was like he\u2019d changed into a different person. Both Song <em>shi </em>and her husband were perplexed. Hearing his words, they anxiously felt his forehead, asking, \u201cCould the fever have returned?\u201d</p><br/><p>Not finding anything out of the ordinary, Song <em>shi </em>sighed in relief. Smiling at Leng <em>shi, </em>she said, \u201cThat child isn\u2019t sensible, please excuse his behaviour. If not for your medicinal herbs that day, he wouldn\u2019t have recovered so quickly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Translator Comments:</p><br/><p>Thankful for all the enthusiastic responses we\u2019ve gotten, so we decided to post the chapter ahead of schedule! The chapter actually ended mid-sentence but it was really awkward so we just finished it. Today I discovered that I suck at using chopsticks and my chicken slipped into the vegetable plate and it was really embarrassing because I couldn\u2019t pick it up after that.</p><br/><p><strong>3.2</strong></p><br/><p>At this, Song <em>shi </em>once again thanked Leng<em> shi </em>profusely.</p><br/><p>Without that medicine, while Li Yu wouldn\u2019t have died, he definitely wouldn\u2019t have recovered so quickly either. Even worse, if the fever had continued the way it did before, there was no saying whether his brain cells would\u2019ve been burnt or not. As such, Song <em>shi </em>was incredibly grateful towards Leng <em>shi. </em></p><br/><p>Shaking her head, Leng<em> shi </em>replied, \u201cThere\u2019s no need to thank me anymore. We\u2019re neighbours, and it was only right for me to help you.\u201d Looking down, she saw Li Yu bowing his head silently, and said, \u201cJust now, Young Master Li said he was feeling unwell. Should we get a physician to look at him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Moved, Song <em>shi </em>stood up, pulling Li Yu up with her. \u201cWe are immensely thankful for Madame\u2019s care, but our Residence just so happens to have a physician. It\u2019s already quite late, so we will leave first.\u201d</p><br/><p>They had visited for quite a while, till lunchtime.</p><br/><p>Leng <em>shi </em>originally wanted them to stay and eat together, but unexpectedly they were insistent on leaving, so she didn\u2019t force them to remain.</p><br/><p>When they were leaving, Xie Zhen suddenly came out of nowhere, clutching at Leng <em>shi</em><em>\u2018s </em>thighs. Blinking her dark almond eyes, she looked at Song <em>shi</em>curiously.</p><br/><p>The other time she hadn\u2019t visited the Li Residence with them, so Leng <em>shi </em>explained, \u201cLittle Lamb, this is Aunt Song.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen obediently greeted her, \u201cAunt Song.\u201d</p><br/><p>A cute little dumpling suddenly appeared out of the blue, and Song <em>shi</em> almost couldn\u2019t bear to leave. The Xie Family was really blessed with good looks, every single one of them made other people feel ashamed.</p><br/><p>Leng <em>shi </em>told her, \u201cThis is Young Master Li. He\u2019s older than you by half a year, so you should call him Big Brother.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen nodded, saying, \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu.\u201d</p><br/><p>[The \u2018Yu\u2019 she uses is actually the \u2018Yu\u2019 for jade, which is not the same as the Yu in his name. \u2018Xiao\u2019 also means small, so she\u2019s actually making fun of him.]</p><br/><p>Upon catching sight of her, Li Yu\u2019s face abruptly changed colour. He\u2019d already embarrassed himself of her time after time, so he never wanted to see her again.</p><br/><p>Seeing that her son was staying silent, Song <em>shi </em>laughed apologetically, saying, \u201cYu <em>er</em> has been reticent since young, and doesn\u2019t like talking to people that much. Second Miss shouldn\u2019t find it too strange, sooner or later, after he becomes more familiar with you, then he\u2019ll talk more.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t mind it one bit. \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu is very pretty, even when he doesn\u2019t speak he\u2019s still good-looking.\u201d</p><br/><p>Li Yu looked like a disgruntled cat whose tail had been stepped on, and immediately glared at her.</p><br/><p>When Song <em>shi </em>had left, Xie Zhen stood at the door and laughed, seeming to be unbelievably cute. After promising to visit soon for them to play again, Song <em>shi</em>left for the Li Residence.</p><br/><p>The moment Li Yu reached home, he went into his room alone and changed his clothes. From then on, he decided resolutely to never interact with the Xie Family ever again. Especially not with that smelly girl. Even if she looked adorable, and no matter how good her singing was, he still didn\u2019t like her!</p><br/><p>*</p><br/><p>After sending off Song <em>shi</em> and Li Yu, Xie Zhen happily bounced back into the hall with Leng <em>shi</em>.</p><br/><p>They hadn\u2019t reached the hall before Leng <em>shi </em>stopped and turned around. With an unscrutable look on her face she asked, \u201cLittle lamb, what exactly happened just now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Puzzled, Xie Zhen blinked. \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng <em>shi </em> recalled Li Yu\u2019s earlier attitude, and the unfinished sentence that the Li maidservant had spoken before cutting herself off. \u201cDid you meet Young Master Li before that?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen honestly nodded, and pointed towards the side hallway. \u201cI met him there.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah, that explained why Li Yu\u2019s behaviour had been so strange earlier. Her daughter must have provoked him, and eventually angered him. Leng <em>shi</em>sighed heavily. Little lamb had been different since young, and was mischievous and naughty. Ah, never mind, she would act innocent and pitiful anyway, and even if she wanted to teach her a lesson she herself couldn\u2019t bear to do so.</p><br/><p>In the beginning, Leng <em>shi </em>had actually assumed that the two children had a simple fight. But after Shuang Yu told her the truth, she realised it had been entirely different from what she had thought.</p><br/><p>This, this Little Lamb\u2026</p><br/><p>No wonder Li Yu\u2019s face had been so pale when he left!</p><br/><p>Poor child, she reckoned that the incident had left him with a rather bad impression\u2026</p><br/><p>Leng <em>shi\u2019s </em>guess was correct. In the next two months, whle Song <em>shi</em> had visited a number of times, there had been no sight of Li Yu.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had even disappointedly asked, \u201cAunt Song, why hasn\u2019t Big Brother Xiao Yu come?\u201d</p><br/><p>Song<em> shi</em> thought of Li Yu\u2019s unyielding rejection, and smiled politely. \u201cHis health hasn\u2019t been too good these days, so he needs to stay home to rest.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen nodded sensibly, and didn\u2019t ask again.</p><br/><p>Two months later, summer turned into autumn, and the weather became much more cool.</p><br/><p>When Xie Liqing had just arrived in Qing Zhou as an official, he had initially been very busy, but now that everything had been completed, he could finally spare some time to take a break. Just when he was thinking of bringing his whole family out to the countryside to look around, he received an invitation from the upper level of government. Gao Qing was a Military Scribe in the Central Governing Office, and his mother\u2019s 70th birthday celebration would be held in a couple days, so they had invited many officials in Qing Zhou to go.</p><br/><p>They had just moved to Qing Zhou, and hadn\u2019t visited many places in the city. It just so happened that they could use this chance to network and get to know more people.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing informed Leng <em>shi</em> of this, and Leng <em>shi </em>immediately started making preparations for the gifts and clothing.</p><br/><p>On the seventeenth day of the seventh month, she woke the children up early in the morning. Xie Zhen still looked half-asleep, and burrowed into her mother\u2019s arms, mumbling, \u201cAh Niang why is it so early\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng <em>shi</em> pinched her face lightly, before having Shuang Yu and Shuang Yan bring her and Xie Xun to bathe. She then picked out some clothes from the closet. That day was her daughters\u2019 first appearance in front of the nobility, and they definitely needed to dress up beautifully for it.</p><hr/><br/><p>Translator Comments:</p><br/><p>Today\u2019s Friday, and we don\u2019t have to wake up early tomorrow, so there\u2019s gonna be a second chapter posted after this!

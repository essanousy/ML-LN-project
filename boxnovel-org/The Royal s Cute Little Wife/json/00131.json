He visited all the famous doctors in capital to treat his son\u2019s injured leg. It is said that his injuries is so serious that the doctors is at their wits\u2019 end. He probably won\u2019t be able to walk this path for the rest of my life. \u201d</p><br/><p>The porcelain bowl fell to the ground with a thud, shattering into pieces.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun\u2019s face turned pale white, she anxiously stood up and walked out: \u201cI, I want to go and see him.\u201d</p><br/><p>In order to save her, big brother Zhong Shang had even crippled his leg! Can\u2019t walk for the rest of his life? He was the son that General Zhong was most proud of. He was valiant enough to kill his enemies. If he lost a leg, how would he be able to keep his head up in the future? Thinking about all these, Xie Xun felt extremely guilty, she could not sit still, she just wanted to see how Zhong Shang was doing.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng called out to her: \u201cAh Xun!\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she was worried about Zhong Shang\u2019s situation, it wasn\u2019t appropriate for her to rashly rush over. She paced back and forth on the spot. After making up her mind, she let the servant bring the gifts she had prepared earlier and majestically left in the direction of the General of Agile Cavalry Palace.</p><br/><p>Before she could even get close, she saw one doctor after another walking out of the manor\u2019s entrance. All of them had bitter expressions on their faces, and their heads were sunken in disarray as they shook their heads as they walked. When Xie Xun and Madam Leng saw this, their hearts sank.</p><br/><p>When the servant heard the purpose of their visit, he welcomed them into the central room to wait, then turned around to invite General Zhong and the General\u2019s wife over.</p><br/><p>Zhong Kai and his wife rushed over. Madame Liu seemed to have just cried; her eyes were red and her face was filled with grief. They had heard what had happened from Zhong Shang\u2019s mouth. His son had been injured because he wanted to save a girl, and now that he had ended up like this, he was willing to do so. Thinking about it, Mrs. Zhong could not help but take another glance at Xie Xun. She was indeed an exquisite little girl, such an appearance was rare even in the capital, no wonder her son liked her so much.</p><br/><p>Madame Zhong withdrew her thoughts and forced herself to smile as she greeted Madam Leng, \u201cShang\u2019er has just had an accident, my entire mind is on him, I have neglected Madame Xie, I hope that you do not take offense to it.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she followed Zhong Chang to the armchair, and invited Madam Leng and Xie Xun to take a seat.</p><br/><p>\u201cMadam Leng hurriedly said that he didn\u2019t, and ordered the servant maid behind him to present his thanks. One of the boxes contained ginseng, deer antlers and other supplements to nourish Zhong Shang\u2019s body.\u201d Since Madame Zhong is so serious, how can I blame you? If not for the fact that Young Master Zhong had risked his life to save his daughter, it was most likely Ah Xun who was lying on the bed right now. We, the Xie Clan, shall remember this kindness in our hearts. Although it is only a small gift, not enough to repay Young Master Zhong for saving his life, please accept you and General Zhong. \u201d</p><br/><p>Madame Zhong rejected it two or three times. Seeing that the Madam Leng was insistent, she ordered the servant to keep it. There was no smile on her face. She seemed to have thought of something sad. She lowered her head and used the handkerchief to touch the corner of her eyes. She seemed to be on the verge of tears again.</p><br/><p>General Zhong, who was standing at the side, heaved a long sigh, as if he had aged ten years in one night. \u201cUseless, useless \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun suddenly raised her head and looked at him in grief.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng\u2019s heart skipped a beat. She thought for a moment and asked:\u201d I wonder how is Young Master Zhong\u2019s injuries?\u201d</p><br/><p>The news was hearsay after all, and there might be a possibility of exaggeration, but she held on to a glimmer of hope that what came out of Zhong\u2019s mouth was another situation. Zhong Shang was only injured, but his leg was still fine. She was disappointed. \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many doctors, and they say they can\u2019t save her. They\u2019ve injured her bones and muscles. I\u2019m afraid she won\u2019t be able to stand up for the rest of her life.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun\u2019s tears suddenly flowed down her face.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t want to be seen, so she lowered her head and silently wiped away her tears.</p><br/><p>On the other side, Madame Zhong watched her without batting an eyelid.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng was startled, felt guilty then regretful: \u201cHow could it be \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>In order to save Xie Xun, Zhong Shang had thrown a leg in. However, she regretted that she had never given him a good face due to her dislike to him in the past. However, she didn\u2019t expect him to be such a righteous junior. He was magnanimous and magnanimous, repayment for his virtue with grievances. This made her feel ashamed of her inferiority.</p><br/><p>What else did he have to doubt Xie Xun\u2019s sincerity?</p><br/><p>Just as Madam Leng was lost in her thoughts, she heard Xie Xun asking hesitantly, \u201cCan I go and see big brother Zhong Shang?\u201d Her voice was low but firm.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Zhong nodded and said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine, I\u2019ll bring you guys over to have a look.\u201d He should be drinking his medicine right now and hasn\u2019t slept yet. \u201d</p><br/><p>General Zhong waved his hand and rubbed his glabella, \u201cYou guys go ahead, I\u2019ll sit here for a while.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun glanced at him before he left, and for some reason, she felt that she had let General and Madam Zhong down. If not for her, Zhong Shang would not have let her be, and nothing would have happened to her. She curled her lips and followed Mrs. Zhong\u2019s footsteps, walking towards the courtyard Zhong Shang was staying in.</p><br/><p>Along the way, Mrs. Zhong and Madam Leng chatted, while Xie Xun silently followed behind them. Her imagination was running wild, and she did not hear a single word they were saying.</p><br/><p>Very quickly they reached the entrance of the courtyard, climbed the stairs and stepped over the threshold. Just as they reached the the Gallery veranda, they heard an angry shout from inside: \u201cNo, I won\u2019t drink it. Get out of here!\u201d</p><br/><p>It was big brother Zhong Shang!</p><br/><p>Xie Xun\u2019s eyes lit up, she anxiously wanted to go in and see him, but with Mrs. Zhong and Madam Leng blocking right in front of her, she could only restrain her excitement and follow him into the house.</p><br/><p>Upon hearing this, Mrs. Zhong knew that he did not drink the medicine again. She went around the flowers and birds, creating a purple sandalwood screen. She said sorrowfully, \u201cHow can you not drink the medicine? Are you trying to scare me and your father to death!\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang said in a cold voice, \u201cIn any case, there\u2019s no difference whether I drink the medicine or not \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he raised his head, he found that both Xie Xun and Madam Leng were there. Xie Xun stood at the back of Madam Leng and looked at him with her moist and red almond-shaped eyes, feeling guilty but also distressed.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang was immediately no longer angry, he withdrew his temper and squinted his eyes.</p><br/><p>Mrs. Zhong seemed to not notice his change as she continued, \u201cThat\u2019s not the way it is. The doctor said it, only by drinking the medicine will you have a chance \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He smiled slightly, as if he was a completely different person. \u201cWhy are Mrs. Xie and Little Sister Ah Xun here? Mother did not tell me in advance. \u201d</p><br/><p>Mrs. Zhong paused before continuing to explain, \u201cMrs. Xie was worried about your injuries, so she brought Miss Xie to see you. Who would have thought that with your temper, you wouldn\u2019t be able to scare people. \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang wanted to get off the bed and bow, but his other leg could not support him, so he stood up and fell back down the bed. He could only laugh helplessly: \u201cI simply hate these servants for being so clumsy. They don\u2019t even know how to cool the medicine a little when they bring it in. I don\u2019t have any intentions towards Mrs. Xie and Little Sister Ah Xun \u2026 However, I have the heart but not the strength that I can\u2019t pay respect to Mrs. Xie.\u201d</p><br/><p>In Xie Xun\u2019s eyes, this was naturally another source of heartache.</p><br/><p>Even someone as staunch as Madam Leng could not help but be moved, and console him: \u201cSince it\u2019s like this, why do you still care about those false etiquettes? Don\u2019t get up, I\u2019m just worried, that\u2019s why I came to visit you \u2026 I never thought that it would cause you to become like this \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s smile was honest, without a trace of his usual sloppy attitude, as if he had matured a lot overnight, \u201cBack then when the situation was urgent, I didn\u2019t think too much about it. If I do not save her in time, Little Sister Ah Xun might very well lose her life.</p><br/><p>With that, he looked to Xie Xun, and his eyes were filled with deep love and without any complaints or regrets.</p><br/><p>Seeing that, Madam Leng started to seriously reflect on whether she had done something wrong before. She had never known Zhong Shang, so based on the impression that she had heard of him from outside, perhaps he had long since changed his mind? Moreover, his feelings for Xie Xun did not seem to be fake.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang asked: \u201cCan I talk to Little Sister Ah Xun alone for a bit?\u201d</p><br/><p>Everyone present had their own thoughts, and only Xie Xun was simple, unable to understand what was behind it. She looked at Madam Leng, who said to Mrs. Zhong: \u201cIt just so happens that I have something to say with Mrs. Zhong. Do you want to come out with me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Mrs. Zhong nodded and the two of them walked out of the room.</p><br/><p>Everyone had already left the room. Zhong Shang leaned against the headboard, and a bowl of medicine was placed on the table beside him. He smiled gently: \u201cAh Xun, feed the medicine to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just now, when he called her \u201cLittle Sister Ah Xun\u201d so sweetly, he naturally became intimate with her as soon as she left.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun felt that something was wrong, but she couldn\u2019t figure it out. Seeing that his leg was injured, she didn\u2019t reject him. Taking a few steps forward, she sat on the palisander beside the bed. He picked up the black medicinal bowl, scooped a spoonful, and brought it to his mouth. \u201cDrink it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang drank it from her hand, and when she scooped another spoonful, he reminded her: \u201cBlow cool.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun blew on it obediently.</p><br/><p>Too obedient, too obedient. She fed him a spoonful, and he drank a spoonful, and her eyes blinked and she began to cry.</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang raised his hand to wipe the tears on her face, and said with a smile: \u201cWhat are you crying for?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun sobbed, and almost hugged his arm to repent. \u201cBig Brother Zhong Shang won\u2019t be able to walk anymore in the future \u2026 It\u2019s all my fault, it\u2019s all my fault\u2026 \u201d</p><br/><p>She had blamed herself for all the mistakes. If she did not say it out loud, Zhong Shang would not have known that she was blaming herself so much. His heart ached at once. He patiently wiped away her tears, feeling both amused and helpless. \u201cHow can I blame you? Did you know that rocks will come crashing down? I was lucky that I saved you and didn\u2019t injure you. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun stubbornly shook her head. It was her fault anyways, she shouldn\u2019t have sat there resting, she shouldn\u2019t have gone up the mountain to incense \u2026 Her crying got worse and worse. In the end, Zhong Shang had no choice but to place his hands on her shoulders and comforted her, \u201cGood Ah Xun, don\u2019t cry anymore. When you cry, Big Brother Zhong Shang will feel heartache.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun sobbed for a while, and rubbed her eyes on his shoulder as she muttered, \u201cThen what will you do in the future? You can\u2019t leave in your entire life? \u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang\u2019s eyes flashed, and after a moment of silence, he asked: \u201cIf I can\u2019t leave in my entire life, would you despise me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun shook her head without hesitation, \u201cNo!\u201d</p><br/><p>His eyes curved into a smile. \u201cWill you take care of me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun buried her face in his neck, unable to see his expression, and heavily nodded. \u201cI will!\u201d</p><br/><p>His smile grew brighter and brighter. \u201cFor the rest of my life?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun still nodded, \u201cYes.\u201d</p><br/><p>Zhong Shang held her tighter and tighter, he lowered his head and kissed her hair, \u201cWe\u2019ve agreed to it, you\u2019re not to go back on your words.\u201d</p><br/><p>Outside the house, Madam Leng and Mrs. Zhong were walking side by side with two servant maids behind them.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat would you like to say to me, Mrs. Xie?\u201d asked Madame Zhong.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng thought for a long time before asking tactfully: \u201cYoung Master\u2019s leg is injured, if he could not be cured, will the marriage be affected?\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Mrs. Zhong sighed and shook her head. \u201cTo tell you the truth, Shang\u2019er is already at the age to get married. He was originally fine with it, but now that he can\u2019t walk on a single leg, which family would be willing to marry their daughter to a \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Hearing that, Madam Leng stopped.</p><br/><p>After some thought, she decided, \u201cMrs. Zhong, please listen to my thoughts.\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

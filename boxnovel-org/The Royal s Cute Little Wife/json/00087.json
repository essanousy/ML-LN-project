She was immediately frightened by the soldiers and horses surrounding the courtyard. She was speechless. \u201cYou, you guys are \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu didn\u2019t hear what she said and stopped in front of Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was stunned, as she never thought that he would come here. Her almond eyes were wide open, and her pink lips were slightly parted as she stammered, \u201cBig, Big Brother Xiao Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu carried her in his embrace, and pressed her head close to his chest. He said hoarsely, \u201cIt\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>His arms were stronger than ever, his chest firmer, and his whole body was manly. Xie Zhen\u2019s waist hurt, and she wanted to look at his face, but discovered that he seemed to have grown taller. She could only see his firm chin and protruding adam\u2019s apple.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu couldn\u2019t care about the fact that his subordinates and outsiders were present, and couldn\u2019t control his desire for her. He buried his head in her hair, greedily absorbing the fragrance of her body.</p><br/><p>Her scent hadn\u2019t changed in the slightest. It was still a faint fragrance of lotus flowers, both delicate and delicate at the same time.</p><br/><p>He seemed to smell it all the time he\u2019d been at the border, but when he opened his eyes, there was nothing there. At that time, he truly missed her. He always felt that time passed too slowly, every day was torturous. Now that he was back, he held her in his arms and smelled her scent. She was still his lamb.</p><br/><p>He raised his head slightly, and saw Gao Xun standing under the window.</p><br/><p>When they came in, Gao Xun originally wanted to escape with Xie Zhen, but he didn\u2019t expect that the one who would come would be him.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun stood rooted to the ground, completely at a loss as to what to do, and felt a little awkward. \u201cAh Yu \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>When he came, he already knew what was going on. Gao Xun appearing here was undoubtedly equivalent to saving Xie Zhen. He said in a neutral tone, \u201cThank you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Surprise flashed across Gao Xun\u2019s face, but he quickly put on a relaxed smile, \u201cWhy do you need to thank me before?\u201d</p><br/><p>As he said that, he walked past him and patted his shoulder as if nothing had happened, \u201cAh Zhen fell into the water and caught a cold last night. She burned up the whole night, take good care of her.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu nodded and hugged Xie Zhen even more tightly.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun\u2019s hatred towards him had already faded with the passage of time. After all, they were brothers who had grown up together since childhood, and even though they hadn\u2019t met since many years ago, their relationship had still disappeared. Before, he was angry because he had left without saying anything and snatched away his beloved. But now that he thought about it, even if Xie Zhen didn\u2019t marry him, based on her status as a the fifth girl of Xie Family, she would never have married him.</p><br/><p>That was why Xie Zhen could be called Little Fairy?</p><br/><p>He was a mortal who was never worthy of Xie Zhen.</p><br/><p>Even if he was to leave the stage, he should have been able to walk with his head held high and his feet held high.</p><br/><p>When Yan Yu asked his subordinate to give him a horse, he jumped on it and without looking back, he shouted for his horse to take him away and left this place. This place was basically the last memory of him and Xie Zhen. Even if it was a one-sided dream on his part, it was enough for him to cherish it for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>Gao Xun rode far away and suddenly laughed out loud. His laughter transmitted into the valley and startled the birds on the tree that were resting.</p><br/><p>He stopped only when he could no longer see the farmhouse. He lowered his head for a long time, but did not know what he was doing. In the end, he raised the horsewhip and slowly rode towards the capital.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu thanked the hunters and gave them some silver before bringing Xie Zhen back to capital.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu had just returned from Wu Jiang today, and before he had even taken off his armor when he returned to the sixth prince Palace, he heard from the steward that Xie Zhen had disappeared. He interrogated them carefully about what had happened and called over a hundred and eighty soldiers to search the forest. These people had just returned from the border pass with him. They hadn\u2019t even sat down to warm up before they were called back.</p><br/><p>Right now, they were following behind Yan Yu, heading back to capital together.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen and Yan Yu were riding together, surrounded by expressionless army officers.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu brought her along a small road in the countryside before when he suddenly lowered his head and whispered into her ear, \u201cWhy are you so stiff? \u201cAren\u2019t you happy to see me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen shook his head and whispered, \u201cNo.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was embarrassed, in front of so many people, did she have to be intimate with Yan Yu? She wasn\u2019t that thick-skinned and didn\u2019t want to be seen as a joke.</p><br/><p>Hence, when she left the Hunter\u2019s house, she sat straight up, her back maintaining a certain distance from Yan Yu\u2019s chest.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu embraced her waist, and let her lean into his embrace. He placed his hand on her forehead and touched it, then whispered to her, \u201cIt\u2019s gone, do you feel uncomfortable anywhere else? Do you want me to walk a little slower? \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen still shook his head, his small head still shaking in front of his chest, causing him to feel extremely itchy.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu thought for a bit, and couldn\u2019t help but ask: \u201cWas it Gao Xun who found you last night? He sent you to a hunter\u2019s house. Where do you live? \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen said, \u201cAunt Xu, clean up an empty room. I will sleep with Aunt Xu tonight, and Big Brother Gao Xun and Auntie Xu\u2019s husband will sleep together.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was relieved.</p><br/><p>The two of them continued on their journey. Ancient trees covered the sky and blotted out the sun. The dense leaves on the trees blocked the sun above. The forest was cool and quiet, only the sound of the horses\u2019 hooves crunching on the leaves could be heard. Yan Yu and Xie Zhen were at the front, flanked by his capable subordinates, one of them Zhou Huaizhi.</p><br/><p>Zhou Huaizhi could not help but look at Xie Zhen a few more times since he had never seen him before.</p><br/><p>But right at this time, Yan Yu lowered his head and asked: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you talking to me? Do you not miss me? \u201d</p><br/><p>As Xie Zhen stared at Zhou Huaizhi\u2019s eyes and wanted to hear what he had to say, she felt awkward and answered vaguely.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was not satisfied and insisted on asking: \u201cDid you miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s face turned slightly red, her almond eyes were moist enough to drip water, \u201cDon\u2019t ask this for now.\u201d</p><br/><p>Why did he have to ask in front of so many people? Can\u2019t I go back and say something?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu lowered his head to look at her rosy face, and glared at Zhou Xuan with his eyes. Zhou Zheng immediately coughed once and looked forward with his well-behaved. He was not going to act rashly.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s hands wrapped around her waist, he extended forward to hold onto the reins, and pretended to be depressed: \u201cI only walked for a year, and my Little Lamb is no longer close to me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s face became even redder, and protested: \u201cDon\u2019t speak nonsense.\u201d</p><br/><p>How close they used to be before he left in a year, and why did it seem to have changed? In the past, he wouldn\u2019t have said such words even if he was beaten to death!</p><br/><p>He moved closer and asked again, \u201cThen do you miss me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen lowered his head and held the hand that held the reins, and gently scratched it, \u201cI thought of it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Her strength was very light, like a small animal acting coquettishly. An itchy sensation spread from her hands into his heart, causing his heart to soften by half. Yan Yu released the reins in one hand, then pressed her head against his chest, lowering his head to kiss the top of her head, \u201cWhy can\u2019t I see it?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen did not say a word. He maintained this posture and rode a horse, tempering himself to the point that his skin was thicker and thicker. He did not feel embarrassed at all in front of others, making her blush all over.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen buried her head into his chest, exposing only her two bright red ears. Her voice was as soft as a mosquito\u2019s, \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu, don\u2019t ask anymore!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu knew that she was really shy and finally let her go. He touched her head and did not force her.</p><br/><p>A group of people entered the capital, causing quite a stir among the citizens of the city.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu told them to all return, and she brought Xie Zhen back to the sixth prince Palace.</p><br/><p>Walking out of the busiest street, they arrived at the road that they had to take back to the residence. There were many mansions on both sides of the road, and all of them were the well-known families in capital. There were few pedestrians on the road, and carriages were all passing by.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu pressed Xie Zhen all the way to his chest, and waited until no one was around before he lowered his head and bit her ear. \u201cLittle Lamb?\u201d</p><br/><p>She gave a little grunt.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to ask me?\u201d</p><br/><p>Of course there were, and a lot of them. It was just that she hadn\u2019t been able to find any convenience on the way back, so she kept it in her heart. She had originally planned to ask again after returning to the sixth prince Palace, but since there weren\u2019t many people left, she asked.</p><br/><p>She raised her head to look at his Adam\u2019s apple, and couldn\u2019t help but reach out to touch it. \u201cWhen did you come back?\u201d How do you know where I am? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu caught hold of her small hand that was moving randomly, and bit her finger: \u201cI came back today, and when I came back, I heard from steward that something happened to you, so I rushed back to the mountain in a hurry. I heard from the mountain guards that I couldn\u2019t find you halfway up the mountain, so I went down to the foot of the mountain to search for you.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen exclaimed in realization, \u201cWhere is my Abba and brother?\u201d</p><br/><p>The prince\u2019s mansion is right in front of his eyes, he rode even faster, \u201cFather-in-law is still in Wu Jiang, and will only be back after a while. Xie Rong should have already reached home by now. \u201d</p><br/><p>She revealed a puzzled expression, her big watery eyes were filled with confusion, \u201cMother doesn\u2019t know that something has happened to me?\u201d You didn\u2019t tell her? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yesterday, she had left the mountain ahead of time. It was unknown when Madam Leng and Xie Xun had left.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu rubbed her eyelashes with his thumb, his fingers felt itchy, and he thought that it was fun, \u201cYesterday, when you didn\u2019t come back, steward Zhao did not let anyone know. After I return today, I did not inform anyone about it, as I did not want them to worry. Now that you have returned, if you want to tell them, you can just say so another time. \u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen nodded his head, luckily they did not let Madam Leng know, otherwise, his mother would definitely be worried.</p><br/><p>Returning to the entrance of the sixth prince Palace, the steward Zhao thanked the heavens and earth that they had safely returned. He hurriedly led them back to the Palace, allowing the servant to serve them with tea. He also informed people to go to the mountain and told the guards not to look for him anymore, saying that the Prince\u2019s wife had already been found by the sixth prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was frightened, she went back to her room and fell asleep the moment she laid down on the pillow. Yan Yu stood beside her and looked at her carefully.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu slept until nightfall, and when he woke up, the outside of the window was completely dark. Inside the room, there was a dyed oil lamp, and Yan Yu sat beside her.</p><br/><p>She rubbed her eyes and asked in a sleepy voice, \u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu helped her up because she had just recovered from a serious illness and still needed to drink another day of medicine. Yan Yu had long told the servant maids to fry the antipyretic medicine, and after she woke up, he gave her a warm up and let her drink it.</p><br/><p>After drinking the medicine, Yan Yu placed the bowl to the side.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen grabbed him by the sleeve, and told him the entire situation that happened yesterday, revealing his doubts, \u201cI think there\u2019s people from the First Prince in the Residence. Otherwise, why would someone spread the news around randomly?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu nodded her head, to let her be at ease, \u201cI\u2019ve already asked, the person who spread the news yesterday has been found, don\u2019t worry.\u201d</p><br/><p>While she was asleep, Yan Yu had already asked the steward Zhao to investigate.</p><br/><p>Other than the coachman from yesterday, the ones who had spread the false news in the residence had all been caught, and the coachman was immediately beaten to death. The person who had spread the news randomly was servant maids, Cui Shan. The steward Zhao had been beaten twenty times by Cui Shan, and asked him to instruct her on how to release her. Yan Yu wanted to use her to scam the First Prince, so the first thing he did was to get people to lock her up in the woodshed.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was not too surprised to hear that person was Cui Shan, \u201cNo wonder Mammy Wang always said that she was not a peaceful servant maids a while ago.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu asked: What do you want to do with her?</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tilted his head and thought, \u201cShe was bribed by the First Prince and almost caused me to lose my life.</p><br/><p>After Yan Yu heard this, he already knew what to do.</p><br/><p>Cui Shan could not die for now, he had to stay and confront the First Prince. Yan Yun had placed spies around Xie Zhen, and wanted to kidnap her while he was not around. If news of this spread to the ears of the Emperor Yuan Hui, it would definitely attract extreme anger. As long as the witness and evidence were accurate, Yan Yun would not deny it.</p><br/><p>As for that servant maids Cui Shan \u2026 Just as Xie Zhen had said, being disloyal and unrighteous, after this matter was over, could not be left alive.</p><br/><p>After thinking of a solution, he looked down and saw Xie Zhen looking at him curiously. Under the candlelight, her beautiful face was covered by a layer of hazy veil. With a blink of her watery eyes, Ying Ying, it was no wonder that the sight of it made people itch for her.</p><br/><p>After all, he hadn\u2019t seen her for a year and he couldn\u2019t help but want to get intimate with her.</p><br/><p>He stooped and picked her up and carried her into the inner room.</p><br/><p>Without any warning, Xie Zhen hugged his neck and asked helplessly: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</p><br/><p>His thin lips curled up into a smile. \u201cAfter waiting for a year, of course I\u2019ll make the first move.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just as he was about to reach the bedside, Xie Zhen spoke a few words before blushing and burying her face into his shoulder, \u201cI want to take a bath \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She had fallen from the mountain yesterday, and then into the water, and had walked a long way in the woods, and was already dirty. Since the hunters weren\u2019t able to properly wash up, she couldn\u2019t take it anymore. If she was allowed to be intimate with him like this, she wouldn\u2019t agree to anything.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was confused by her cat-like alluring voice and actually agreed, \u201cAlright, take a bath first.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen heaved a sigh of relief.</p><br/><p>She did not expect that after he told servant maids to take the bath barrel in and boil some hot water, he would actually carry her directly to the back of the screen.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was shocked senseless, \u201c\u2026 Why didn\u2019t you let me off? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu raised her eyebrows, and his lips was revealing a smile, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

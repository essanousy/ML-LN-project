Yan Yu held the snake spear and stabbed it even deeper into his chest. With a fierce spin, his skin and flesh were all twisted into a ball.</p><br/><p>Yan Yun\u2019s pupils constricted. He was in so much pain that his mind was in a mess.</p><br/><p>He spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><br/><p>He was at the end of his road, not far from death. Yan Yu\u2019s stab was just in time, hitting the tip of his heart.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu straightened his body, stepped on his shoulder and asked with a cold and cruel tone, \u201cHave you ever thought that this day would come?\u201d</p><br/><p>When he had cruelly killed Madame Song and Li Xiqing, when he had threatened him with Xie Zhen, when he had shot through Gao Xun with ten thousand arrows, had he thought of his own fate?</p><br/><p>The cycle of karmic retribution.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu clenched his serpent spear. After exiting his body, blood splattered all over the ground, but he didn\u2019t even blink, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you don\u2019t think of it, you can give it a try today.\u201d With that, she gave him a final look, and with a tone nearly filled with pity, she said, \u201cGo and apologize to Father, Mother, and Gao Xun.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yun was already with him. The moment he had thrown out the snake spear, his entire body had convulsed in pain. He had heard his words and was terrified, but most of all, he was filled with hatred.</p><br/><p>Never in his wildest dreams did he imagine that the youth that was so unremarkable would become what he was today. Initially, he looked down on him and thought that he was just a mediocre talent raised by a pair of commoners. He did not even put him in his eyes. Even after killing his parents, he never had the heart to repent. However, he didn\u2019t expect that the thin and weak youth from before would have such a decisive and decisive battle with a heaven-shattering man who wielded a heavy weapon. He had stabbed him with his own hands and had dealt him the heaviest blow.</p><br/><p>All these years of scheming and scheming had all been for naught.</p><br/><p>Yan Yun rolled his eyes, how could he be willing \u2026</p><br/><p>Yan Yu got on his horse, turned around and walked back into the army, and ordered the archers who were already standing in a row: \u201cShoot, no one is to be lenient!\u201d</p><br/><p>The archers received the order and each of them skillfully nocked their arrows.</p><br/><p>Just as Yan Yun stood up, an arrow pierced her leg, causing her body to soften and fall back down.</p><br/><p>Arrows rained down like rain, and behind them, the screams of the soldiers could be heard. Blood spilled all over the ground, and grief filled the air. It was already a miracle that he had been able to withstand so many arrow wounds on his body and that fatal blow to his heart. Now that he had been defeated, the soldiers either fled or perished. Beside him were countless corpses lying in a pool of blood, unwilling to give up.</p><br/><p>After the First Prince\u2019s death, his soldiers had naturally become Yan Yu\u2019s captives.</p><br/><p>There were more than ten thousand prisoners, the majority of whom were strong men that the First Prince had forcefully recruited while he was still alive. No one wanted to kill each other. However, no one could do anything on the battlefield. They could only brace themselves and advance forward. Yan Yu did not punish them severely, he only tortured them with ink on the bodies of the hundreds of officers leading them. The word \u201cJing\u201d was stuck on their backs. Once it was stained with ink, they would never be able to wash it off in their entire lives.</p><br/><p>\u201cJing\u201d represented the Da Jing, indicating that they would always be the citizens of the Da Jing.</p><br/><p>This was already the lightest form of criminal punishment.</p><br/><p>However, this was not the end. Yan Yun had interacted with the Western Yi before, and now that he was dead, the soldiers of the Western Yi still stayed near the Lan Ling County. Yan Yu discussed the battle with the crown prince and decided to lead the troops to the battlefield three days later, to drive the People of Western Yi out of the borders of the Da Jing.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu made his decision. If he could successfully repel the People of Western Yi, then it would be considered as their merit.</p><br/><p>The People of Western Yi was annoying, and they were not as easy to deal with as Yan Yun. They had to fight for half a month before they were chased back to their homeland. To prevent such things from happening in the future, the Crown Prince ordered his men to go to the Western Yi and sign a contract with them. They were not allowed to invade the Da Jing at all for the next thirty years, and if they violated the agreement, the soldiers stationed at the border of the Da Jing would attack them first.</p><br/><p>The war was finally over.</p><br/><p>After the victory, Yan Yu had no time to participate in the celebratory feast, so the first thing he did was to rush back to the capital.</p><br/><p>The Crown Prince Yan Tao asked him, \u201cWhy are you going back with me in just a few days?\u201d</p><br/><p>At that time, he was in the process of choosing a good horse. It would take a dozen or so days to travel from Lan Ling to capital, and he had to choose a strong horse in order to return to capital as soon as possible. Hearing this, he didn\u2019t even stop his actions, directly throwing the bundle onto the saddle and vaulting onto it. \u201cI don\u2019t understand, second brother. I want to go back and accompany my wife.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Tao was startled, an image of a young lady filled with spirit energy surfaced in his mind.</p><br/><p>Just as Yan Yu said, he indeed did not understand. He and the Crown Princess respected each other as if they were common subjects. The two of them had no feelings for each other, so it was impossible for them to understand this kind of feeling of returning home like an arrow.</p><br/><p>There was someone waiting for him at home, looking forward to his return. He should be very happy, right?</p><br/><p>He looked forward to it, and joked: \u201cYour relationship with Ah Zhen is getting deeper and deeper.\u201d</p><br/><p>Ah Zhen?</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Yan Yu raised his eyebrows, and looked towards Yan Tao.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao acted as if he did not realize it, and asked his subordinates to prepare more coils for him to use on the road. Two more vigorous soldiers were assigned to protect him.</p><br/><p>Before he left, he rode two steps, thought about it, then rode back. He stopped in front of Yan Tao and said: \u201cSecond Brother must have misunderstood. Ah Zhen and I knew each other since we were young, we were childhood friends, our relationship had always been good. This is true both before and after the marriage. I was worried that she would be scared when she was alone in capital. \u201d</p><br/><p>There were some hidden meanings in his words, but he had said so much just to make it clear that Xie Zhen was his after all, so it would be best if Yan Tao could dispel the presumptuous thoughts he had.</p><br/><p>Both of them remembered the incident from the previous year clearly.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao wanted to take Xie Zhen as his concubine, but he was interrupted by Yan Yu halfway, and in the end, became his sixth prince\u2019s concubine.</p><br/><p>This matter had always been a knot in Yan Yu\u2019s heart. He knew that they had not forgotten. However, the two of them had concealed their strength well, and it was impossible to see any gaps on the surface. They could only focus on dealing with the First Prince. Now that the First Prince had collapsed and what Yan Yu had promised Yan Tao was done, the window between them should be broken.</p><br/><p>Yan Tao laughed, obviously not putting these words to heart, \u201cWhat is Sixth Brother thinking? Don\u2019t tell me you don\u2019t trust second brother\u2019s character? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not speak.</p><br/><p>\u201cSince Ah Zhen has married you, she is my the sisth sister-in-law. I respect her and would definitely not have any ill intentions towards her.\u201d he said.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu pulled on the reins and wrapped it around his arm twice, he tilted his head and stared at Su Yun for a moment, \u201cSecond brother, you are overthinking it, I am only narrating the truth.\u201d</p><br/><p>As he spoke, the horse hooves trampled on the land after the war, causing yellow sand to fill the sky and gradually disappearing into the distance.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu had walked for a total of more than two months.</p><br/><p>At first, Xie Zhen would ask people about the situation in Lan Ling at first, but later on, somehow, his body became lazier and lazier, and his sleep also grew deeper and deeper. It was as if he was sleeping every day, and didn\u2019t have the energy to do anything. She thought it was because winter was approaching and people would sleep more in the cold weather, so she didn\u2019t take it to heart.</p><br/><p>On the contrary, her appetite was not very good.</p><br/><p>The kitchen was obviously the same as before, but she had no appetite at all. Every chopstick was lifted and put down, not wanting to eat anything.</p><br/><p>The servant maids thought that she had overthought it and tried to think of a way to persuade her to eat more. Otherwise, when Yan Yu came back and saw that she had lost weight, the ones who were unlucky were the servant and the others. Sometimes, when Shuang Yu tried to persuade her at the side, she would barely be able to eat a few mouthfuls.</p><br/><p>When the news of Yan Yu\u2019s victory spread to the capital, he heard that the Emperor Yuan Hui was very happy and seemed much more energetic than before. He even said that when he and the crown prince returned, he would lead a group of ministers to the city gate to welcome them personally.</p><br/><p>The First Prince\u2019s corpse was transported back to Gao Yang and simply buried. It was even worse than the funeral of some commoners.</p><br/><p>The Emperor Yuan Hui deprived him of his status as a prince and demoted him to a commoner. His concubines were all given away, and only his wife, who was guarding his tombstone, stayed with him in Gao Yang.</p><br/><p>The capital had finally recovered its former prosperity and peace.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen let out a long sigh of relief upon hearing this news, and asked Wu Bin when he would be able to return. Wu Bin replied: \u201cThe prince is already on his way back to the capital.\u201d</p><br/><p>Which is to say, he would be at capital in at most half a month.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen asked again, \u201cIs he injured?\u201d</p><br/><p>Wu Bin shook his head, \u201cYour highness, everything is fine.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen asked a few questions consecutively, but only stopped after knowing that he was safe and sound.</p><br/><p>She was sleepy again after waking up. After waving for Wu Bin to go out, she laid on the couch sleepily. She was afraid of the cold. There was a charcoal brazier in the house, and the floor was covered with cashmere blankets. The entire room was warm, without the slightest hint of the chilly autumn wind blowing outside.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu walked in. Seeing that she was about to sleep again, he couldn\u2019t help but be worried. \u201cMiss has been drowsy lately, do you want a doctor to take a look?\u201d</p><br/><p>The two biddy s that were gifted to Xie Zhen by the Madam Leng had returned home a few days ago. Xie Zhen let them go for a few days\u2019 leave and told them to return home to visit their grandchildren.</p><br/><p>Hearing this, Xie Zhen lazily opened his almond eyes, \u201cIt should be because I didn\u2019t sleep well at night \u2026 \u201cThere\u2019s no need to hire a doctor. The moment you invite a doctor, you have to take the medicine. It\u2019s extremely painful.\u201d</p><br/><p>She felt that she was fine. Other than being drowsy, she didn\u2019t have any other ailments. She should be fine in a few days.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu couldn\u2019t persuade her, so he could only let her go.</p><br/><p>In a few days, when she heard that Yan Yu was about to reach capital, she gathered her energy and went out to welcome him. In the beginning, she sat in the main hall and waited for an hour, but eventually Yan Yu still did not come back. She slowly became anxious and went to the courtyard to observe. Today, the sun was shining brightly, causing people to feel dizzy and dizzy.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s forehead was perspiring, he raised his sleeves to wipe it off, and could not help but raise his head to look at the sun above him.</p><br/><p>She didn\u2019t feel hot at all. Why was she sweating?</p><br/><p>After thinking for a long time, he finally understood that it was cold sweat.</p><br/><p>Shuang Yu advised her to return to her room: \u201cI still don\u2019t know when your highness will be back. Miss, please wait in the room first.</p><br/><p>She shook her head and stood there stubbornly. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen him in two months. I want to be the first one to see him!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, he told the others to return to the hut, leaving Shuang Yu and there to wait upon them.</p><br/><p>It was almost noon when Yan Yu finally galloped back to the city gate, heading straight in the direction of the An Wang\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>He jumped off the horse and threw the reins to servant, who was at the door. Without even looking at him, he walked into the courtyard. He left in a hurry, looking a bit worn out from the journey. He did not care about his appearance, and he even had green stubble on his chin. However, he was in high spirits, and his feet were moving in the wind because he knew that someone was waiting for him.</p><br/><p>Passing through the wall of shadows, he saw a girl standing under a ginkgo tree, looking at the leaves on top of her head in boredom.</p><br/><p>She was dressed in a fragrant geese jacket with reed flowers on it, with a green goatskin dress with gold stripes at the bottom. On the outside, she was covered by a golden-edged red Beizi, with a slim and exquisite figure. She wore a gold-threaded jade leaf on her forehead. The leaf hung down on her forehead. As she turned her head, her eyes overflowed with color.</p><br/><p>Skinny.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu took two steps forward, wanted to hug her, also wanted to look at her twice, and stood in place for a long time without moving.</p><br/><p>With both of his hands behind his back, Xie Zhen\u2019s face was pale, but a soft smile hung on his lips: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying anything Big Brother Xiao Yu? Have you gone stupid? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu asked her: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you in the house?\u201d When he opened his mouth, he realized that his voice was a little hoarse.</p><br/><p>She smiled. \u201cI miss you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu\u2019s heart softened. She wanted to rush forward, but just as she moved, she closed her eyes in exhaustion. Her body swayed and fell to the ground!</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was shocked and hurriedly pulled her into his embrace. His arm trembled slightly: \u201cAh Zhen!\u201d</p><br/>\n</div>"}

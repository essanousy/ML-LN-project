The boy\u2019s voice was loud and healthy. The girl\u2019s voice was a bit softer, but her crying was not as loud as her brother. The only thing that could be seen under the swaddling was her red face, and her tears dripped down in a pitiful and sorrowful manner.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu finally couldn\u2019t stand the crying of the two children anymore and asked the midwife to bring the children over.</p><br/><p>The midwife handed the girl to him. He took the girl, seeing the small one with her eyes closed, crying so loudly that she looked extremely vulnerable. Was it this little thing that had tortured Xie Zhen for so long? You were truly disobedient. Why don\u2019t you just obediently come out? He thought, reaching out to touch her cheek. It was too soft, and he was a little afraid of breaking her.</p><br/><p>He raised his head and looked at the other child in the midwife\u2019s arms. The boy was born stronger than the girl, which was probably because he had stolen some of his sister\u2019s nutrition in Xie Zhen\u2019s womb \u2026</p><br/><p>Like a monkey.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu looked at the two of them in disdain. Their facial features were all small, and their eyes were tightly shut. Only a few sparse hairs could be seen on their head, but there was no hint of a beautiful shadow at all.</p><br/><p>Their mother was so beautiful, why couldn\u2019t they inherit something from her?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was afraid that the two children would wake up Xie Zhen. He got the wet nurse to carry the two children down and ordered someone to give the midwife a heavy medical fee and a gift. The quietness in the house returned, Xie Zhen was afraid that she was really tired, she had always been at the light sleep, but the loud crying sound did not wake her up.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu thought back to the pain she experienced when she was giving birth and still felt a lingering fear \u2026 He was even afraid that she wouldn\u2019t be able to hold on. After all, there were many such examples. Fortunately, she was stronger than he had expected. She held on to her last breath and gave birth to both of her children.</p><br/><p>He reached into the quilt and slowly took her hand at his side and squeezed it lovingly and tenderly.</p><br/><p>\u201cAh Zhen\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She was amazing, having two little things all at once. He had previously said that he wanted four or five children, but now he was hesitating because he couldn\u2019t bear for her to suffer like this again. He couldn\u2019t even bear listening to her from the side, so how much pain would she suffer?</p><br/><p>The morning sun was rising outside the window, and it had actually been a whole night.</p><br/><p>He had not closed his eyes that night, but stood beside him, not feeling the least bit tired. He got up and used the morning meal s outside. After coming back to see that Xie Zhen was still awake, he sat on the side of the bed for another hour.</p><br/><p>After feeding the two little fellows some milk, Mrs Xu turned around and went to the kitchen to have someone prepare a pot of pigeon stew for the consort. Because she initially thought it was a child, her wet nurse could only invite one. Thinking that, in the long run, the milk might not be enough to drink from the crown prince and princess, she went in and informed Yan Yu. Yan Yu nodded, \u201cThen let\u2019s have another one.\u201d</p><br/><p>He then instructed Shuang Yu to go and settle some matters.</p><br/><p>After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, someone came in and passed on, \u201cYour highness, the Crown Prince heard that the Empress gave birth to a pair of twins of mixed sex and specially sent him a congratulatory gift. Would you like to meet him?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was a little tired, as he leaned on the side of the square table beside his bed and chewed on it. After a long while, he said, \u201cJust say that Princess Wangfei\u2019s condition is not good, and this king will accompany her here, so it is inconvenient for me to see guests. \u201cPlease thank second brother on my behalf. Please ask him to go home early.\u201d</p><br/><p>servant agreed and left.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu guarded the head of the bed, unknowingly, he was sleepy, but very quickly he fell asleep.</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen woke up, it was already around Shen Shi.</p><br/><p>The doors and windows were all closed, so he couldn\u2019t see outside, but through the muslin window he could see a thin layer of red. The sun was probably going down. She lay on her back, feeling the pain of her body breaking apart and weak at the slightest movement. She was about to call someone when she turned her head and saw a person lying on the bed. That person had his head on the side and his thick eyebrows were slightly raised. Under the dim light, his handsome face could barely be seen.</p><br/><p>When Xie Zhen moved his arm, he immediately sensed something. He opened his eyes and sat up, staring straight at her: \u201cYou\u2019re awake?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen lifted her pale lips, blinked her eyes, and asked, \u201cWhere\u2019s my little lamb?\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she was very tired at the time, she still remembered that she had two children. According to her midwife, the older one was a boy while the younger one was a girl.</p><br/><p>twins of mixed sex!</p><br/><p>She had wanted to die from the pain and never have another child, but now she felt that it was worth it. She couldn\u2019t wait to see the child before she fully woke up. After all, a piece of meat had fallen from her body. She wanted to see what the two of them looked like, but she didn\u2019t know who they looked like. Like her or like Yan Yu?</p><br/><p>Yan Yu didn\u2019t utter a word as he looked at her. He carefully helped her sit up and placed a pillow behind her, \u201cI\u2019ll let you see them later.\u201d</p><br/><p>The first thing she said to the child after he\u2019d been standing there for so long was, in a way, a blow to him.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen leaned on his pillow, the hand on the side of the bed grabbing onto his clothes, and asked with a pitiful look in her eyes: \u201cWhy? I haven\u2019t seen them yet. What do they look like? Does it look good, like me? \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu thought for a while, then patted her head and said: \u201cI don\u2019t think so, I\u2019m a little ugly.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen\u2019s heart was broken, pursed her lips said, \u201cThen I also want to see it.\u201d</p><br/><p>She was born in October! No matter how ugly she was, people still had to take a look. However, no matter how much she begged, Yan Yu just refused to let her see two lambs. Xie Zhen was indeed hungry. After tormenting himself for the whole night, he still had not eaten anything. He glared at Yue Yang aggrievedly as he finished feeding him a bowl of milk pigeon soup. After finishing the soup, she took the opportunity while Yan Yu was wiping her mouth to ask again: \u201cWhere\u2019s my child?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not persist this time and let the wet nurse carry the two children over.</p><br/><p>The two children were wrapped separately in a swaddling of satin makeup, and only a tiny head could be seen. Xie Zhen joyfully let the wet nurse put the child in her arms. She hugged her child to one side and looked at him one by one until she finally came to a conclusion, \u201cHe was not as ugly as you say he is.\u201d</p><br/><p>Just a moment ago, she was already mentally prepared for the sight. To think that the two children would have such exquisite appearances.</p><br/><p>The older one had opened his eyes, his eyelashes raised and long. His big, dark eyes were fixed on her, and he was eating with relish, with a thumb in his mouth. Xie Zhen\u2019s heart almost melted as she lowered her head to touch his nose. She only felt that his entire body was weak, and did not dare to use any strength. She looked at the small one and saw that it was still sleeping with its eyes closed. Her eyes were a little swollen, so she smacked it with her small mouth.</p><br/><p>Just these two little fellows alone, she hadn\u2019t been able to watch them for more than a quarter of an hour. She even tried to converse with the older one. Your sister is a little lamb, and you two little fellows have caused me so much suffering! \u201d</p><br/><p>The little carp continued to eat his fingers. Then he grinned at her as if he understood her words.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu could not help but ask, \u201cWhy are you called Little Carp?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen finally had time to glance at him, his almond-shaped eyes bent, as if he was very willing to explain: \u201cBecause you were called Li Yu before, Humming Carp, and he\u2019s your son. Of course it\u2019s up to you.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>That seemed to make sense.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu did not ask anymore, seeing that she was playing with this one, he was not tired of it. After a while, the little one woke up, opened her mouth and shouted \u201cAh Ah Ah\u201d for milk. When Xie Zhen had been pregnant for seven or eight months, her chest had already swelled up. After giving birth to her child, she had grown a little bigger, and couldn\u2019t help but want to feed him.</p><br/><p>But Yan Yu called for the wet nurse and carried the two children away. She didn\u2019t dare snatch them away, and since she didn\u2019t have any strength left, she could only watch as the two children walked further and further away. She reluctantly asked Yan Yu: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let me feed them?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu replied her as follows: \u201cIt\u2019s enough to have a wet nurse. \u201cYou\u2019ve just finished giving birth, and your body is weak. Besides \u2026\u201d \u201cYou \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you \u2026 you.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen tilted his head and asked: \u201cAnd what?\u201d</p><br/><p>He suddenly stopped talking, avoiding her gaze as he coughed. He said somewhat embarrassedly, \u201cAnyway, having a wet nurse is enough. You don\u2019t have to worry about it.\u201d</p><br/><p>No matter how Xie Zhen asked, he was unwilling to answer.</p><br/><p>Finally, Xie Zhen puffed up his cheeks and laid back down on the bed, falling asleep immediately. She still hadn\u2019t recovered, so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for her to sleep for another three days and three nights.</p><br/><p>It didn\u2019t bother her for long, and in a few nights she would know.</p><br/><p>They were lying on the same bed, and he was tired of her. He gently scooped her up in his arms, lowered his head, and buried it in her chest.</p><br/><p>\u201cBig Brother Xiao Yu?\u201d</p><br/><p>At first, she was confused, but soon she felt a bite on her chest. Then, her face turned red, and her entire body became as hot as a cooked prawn. \u201cYou, you get up!\u201d</p><br/><p>This shameless\u2026 He, he actually fought over the milk with the child!</p><br/><p>He put his hands on his head and tried to push them away, but he hesitated. Because she couldn\u2019t feed her child these few days, her breasts were swollen from the milk, and it would still hurt at night. Now that someone had helped her suck it out, the swelling pain had disappeared. She \u2026 Of course she would be happy. But it can\u2019t be like this!</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen was unable to resist, she was pressed down and eaten fiercely by him for a while. Her face was pure white and her eyes were moist, it was obvious that she was being bullied badly. She whined as she complained, \u201cBite me \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t control his strength well enough to suck too hard. No wonder she cried out for pain.</p><br/><p>Yan Yu ate and drank to his heart\u2019s content. He hugged her in his arms and coaxed her for a good long while before he managed to coax her. \u201cYour mother said that you don\u2019t have enough breast milk, so you can\u2019t care about that after feeding me this. For the sake of not letting me off, it\u2019s better if you give me some money.\u201d</p><br/><p>He knew that he had been taken advantage of, and yet he said it so boldly and boldly!</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had never seen such a shameless person, he laid on his chest and took a bite at his angrily, \u201cBig brother Xiao Yu has changed, you weren\u2019t like this before!\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu actually did not refute him and seriously asked, \u201cHow was I in the past?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen thought about it, and remembered the uncomfortable feeling he had when he was young, compared to today, it was like the difference between heaven and earth. You used to, you used to. You don\u2019t mean what you say. You just want to keep your face a secret. \u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu was not angry, and laughed softly, pinching her tender cheeks: \u201cIn the past, you were chasing after me to play with me.\u201d</p><br/><p>At the time, he thought she was annoying and annoying, and he couldn\u2019t get rid of her. However, she always gave him surprises, causing him to look at her again and again. Afterwards, he would unconsciously look for her, and his gaze would involuntarily fall on her. He obviously wanted to talk to her, but he had to hold onto his airs when she came to look for him.</p><br/><p>When he wanted to play with her later on, he had already returned to the capital.</p><br/><p>To be able to find her after going around in such a large circle, the heavens had truly treated him well.</p><br/><p>Now that the child had come out, he couldn\u2019t just keep calling him by his nickname. He could even call him by his proper name.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen got Shuang Yu to find a book. He sat himself on the bed and flipped through the entire afternoon, thinking of several names, but he still could not find a suitable one.</p><br/><p>Just as she was having a headache, Yan Yu said casually: \u201cThe big one is called strict, and the small one is called Yan Jin, is that not okay?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen stared at him, stupefied. She thought, if she really named him, would she agree to it when she grows up? She asked, \u201cAre you serious?\u201d</p><br/><p>Yan Yu nodded, it seemed like he was not joking.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen wanted to struggle a bit more, but he acted quickly, and on the same day, he made someone report to the Emperor Yuan Hui and asked for his opinion. Having father means having son. With a wave of his large brush, Emperor Yuan Hui bestowed the word \u201cSu\u201d to his little grandson and daughter, \u201cJin\u201d.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen wanted to cry.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

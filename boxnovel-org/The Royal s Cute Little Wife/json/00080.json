In the distance, the river bank was brightly lit and filled with people. It was bustling with noise and excitement. She wanted to take Yan Yu to guess the riddle, but after a few steps, she suddenly stopped. She didn\u2019t know if it was an illusion, but she felt that there was someone following them. However, when they thought about it carefully, they felt that it was impossible. They were standing in the dark, so who would be able to see them? She thought she was overthinking it. She stood at the intersection of the lake and the street, inadvertently raising her gaze to the second floor of a teahouse. Indeed, she met a pair of sharp and deep eyes. The teahouse was set up right in front of the street. People swarmed towards the door of the teahouse. The first floor had a storyteller telling the story. The second floor was a private room. The attic was exquisite. It was clear that this was not a place where ordinary people came and went. She saw the man sitting by the window with two men in the uniform of the guards standing behind him. The man greeted her with a smile. The First Prince? Xie Zhen did not expect to meet him here, after a moment of astonishment, a feeling of discomfort gradually welled up in her heart. She can\u2019t say \u2026. Instinctively, she did not like Yan Wen. Yan Yu noticed her abnormality and followed her gaze. When he saw the people on the roof, his expression didn\u2019t change, but his fists under his sleeves tightened secretly. There were people blocking their way through the streets. Soon, the First Prince\u2019s guards walked out of the teahouse and came up to them. \u201cThe Prince Ping invites the Sixth Highness to come down and take a seat upstairs.\u201d The First Prince Yan Wen was bestowed the title of Prince by the Yuan Hui Emperor when he was eighteen years old. He was currently residing in the Prince Ping\u2019s Mansion outside the palace. The \u2018Ping\u2019 that Yuanhui Emperor bestowed upon him contained many profound meanings. It was most likely meant for him to calm his heart and live a peaceful life. However, the Yuan Hui Emperor did not understand his own children, Yan Wen was the first born son of the former Empress, how could he be willing to be an ordinary prince? Now, the Yuan Hui Emperor was strong and healthy. Before the age of abdication, if anything happened to his body, perhaps the day of Yan Wen\u2019s rebellion would come. His military strength was now on par with the Crown Prince\u2019s, while Yan Yu was highly valued by the Yuan Hui Emperor, and he had control of the two hundred thousand soldiers at the border. If he could take Yan Yu under his command, it would be like adding wings to a tiger. Then, the outcome of the battle between Yan Wen and the crown prince would be decided. Unfortunately, Yan Yu belonged to the Crown Prince. He had tried his best to win him over, but to no avail. In addition to the irreconcilable contradictions between Yan Yu and him, there was still something he couldn\u2019t resolve. He wanted to bribe Yan Yu, it was not that simple. Yan Yu paused for a moment, then tactfully declined, \u201cThe Prince\u2019s Wife not feeling well, please help me inform Big Brother, we are preparing to return to our Mansion, so we will not go up.\u201d The guard straightened up, glanced at Xie Zhen, nodded, and turned back to report. Xie Zhen stared in the direction he had left until the guard went upstairs to report to the First Prince. The First Prince raised his teacup and shook his head in regret. Only then did they leave. Xie Zhen noticed his displeasure and asked after they had left, \u201cWhat kind of person is the First Prince?\u201d When they stopped under a bridge and the lanterns floated past them, Yan Yu finally said, \u201cPrince Ping\u2019s methods are vicious and his schemes are complex. It\u2019s best if you stay away from him.\u201d He was not called Big Brother Yan Wen, but Prince Ping. There seemed to be something else involved. Xie Zhen nodded as if she understood. At the same time, there were a few familiar figures standing on the opposite shore. In the previous year, Madam Leng had asked Xie Rong to take Xie Xun around the streets and pick out some beautiful lanterns to bring back. During this period of time, the entire mansion had been rather depressed over the matter of Xie Liqing going to Wu Jiang. Since Madam Leng doted on the children, she intentionally made them go out on the streets to relax. Xie Xun didn\u2019t like lanterns. She liked Mianren on the streets. Xie Rong let the seller draw a Xiao Xun, paid for her, and took her to the shore for a walk. There were many lanterns under the trees in front, and red lines were drawn on the trees. Beneath each red line was a scented sache. Inside the scented sachet, there were half of poetry. This tree was covered with scented sachet, but there was only one pair of compelet poetry. If someone could obtain the complete poetry with another person, then that was fate. Therefore, there were many girls and boys standing under the tree. One by one, they filled with hope, took down their scented sachets, and began to search for their fates. Both Xie Xun and Xie Rong were not interested in the tree. One of them was too young, while the other one felt that it was too unreliable. Just as they were about to walk around the tree, they heard a sound coming from behind them. \u201cSeventh Miss!\u201d Xie Xun turned around, biting on her sugar. Amongst the crowd, she saw Princess He Yi standing in the light. She was wearing a long skirt. She wore a silk cape with gold makeup, and a pearl green dress. She was very pretty. It was obvious that she had been carefully dressed up. Xie Xun saw a girl around her who was about the same height as her. She wore a brocade hairpin, a gold dress with a light red silk dress, and a yellow embroidered skirt. Her figure was slender and elegant, and although she was dressed in an eye-catching manner, her face was covered by a transparent silk veil, revealing only a pair of beautiful eyes and a pair of elegant willow leaf eyebrows. She followed the direction of Princess He Yi\u2019s gaze. That glance was filled with the moving of the wind and the moonlight, which made people\u2019s imaginations run wild. Xie Xun didn\u2019t have a deep friendship with Princess He Yi, so when they got close to her, she shyly smiled: \u201cAre you guys here to watch the lantern festival as well?\u201d When Yan Yao\u2019an saw Xie Rong, she usually straightforward young miss blushed and didn\u2019t dare to look at him too much. She quickly looked away and said to Xie Xun: \u201cYes, I originally wanted to ask Sixth Brother to bring me here, but since he didn\u2019t agree, I had no choice but to come out myself.\u201d It was only at this time of year that the Yuan Hui Emperor allowed her to leave the palace. Saying this, Yan Yao\u2019an introduced the girl beside her, \u201cThis is the fourth daughter of the Grand Secretariat Gu, Gu Ruyi.\u201d With that, she introduced the two of them to Miss Gu. \u201cRuyi, this is the Second Young Master and the Seventh Miss of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.\u201d Gu Ruoyi looked at the two and smiled. Even so, Yan Yao\u2019an was an impatient person. Before she could say anything, she caught sight of the Marriage Tree hanging behind her. \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Xie Xun had just known it, so she could explain it to her. \u201cThere is a scented sachet hanging on the tree, and within the scented sachet is written a poem. If two people\u2019s poems could be combined, it would be a kind of fate.\u201d Hearing this, Yan Yao\u2019an\u2019s interest was piqued, and she led Gu Ruoyi forward, \u201cLet\u2019s go take a look as well!\u201d She had not taken two steps when she saw Xie Xun and Xie Rong standing there motionless. She thought for a moment before turning around and bringing Xie Xun along with her. \u201cAh Xun, come as well.\u201d Xie Xun would not refuse someone, so she had no choice but to follow them. She turned to Xie Rong for help, and he actually followed her. They stood under the tree. The one below had already been picked up by the others. Yan Yao\u2019an wanted to reach the top one. She stood on tiptoe for a long time, but still couldn\u2019t reach it. She was not convinced, so she asked the guards behind her to help her take it off. She did not open it, and encouraged Gu Ruoyi to take a scented sachet as well. Gu Ruyi picked the one closest to her. The two of them opened it at the same time. Yan Yao\u2019an\u2019s note was written in calligraphy: \u201cHow does your jade face look like? Plum blossoms, snow in the spring, body is covered by clouds in morning sunlight.\u201d They looked at Gu Ruoyi\u2019a note, it was a simple sentence: \u201cWishing you well and a long time.\u201d Yan Yao\u2019an read the note over and over again, feeling very depressed, \u201cWhat does this mean? How easy is your note to understand,\u201d Wishing you well and a long time, we can see the beautiful moon together!\u201d Gu Ruoyi\u2019s eyes held a smile as she comforted her: \u201cIt\u2019s just joining in for the fun of it, there\u2019s no need to take it seriously.\u201d She thought for a moment before feeling much more at ease. However, when she turned her head to see Xie Rong holding a scented sachet in his hands, her hope was rekindled. \u201cWhat did Second Young Master\u2019s note?\u201d Xie Rong folded the note with a normal expression and put it back into his sleeve. \u201cIt\u2019s just a casual poem.\u201d Yan Yao\u2019an pursed her lips in disappointment. It would be great if she could form a pair with him. She turned around to speak to Gu Ruoyi, who was standing in a brightly lit area. Her face was tranquil, and her eyebrows were like moths in the ocean. She tilted her head and smiled at Gu Ruoyi, revealing the splendor of her surroundings. Xie Rong looked away, and just in time to see Xie Xun join in the fun. She pulled down a scented sachet from the tree, and mysteriously untied it in front of him. \u201cSuddenly looking back, that right person was in a place with no lights? What\u2019s that?\u201d Xie Rong rubbed her head and led her away. After a few steps, he saw Yan Yu and Xie Zhen approaching from the other side. He immediately forgot about the note and called out from afar, \u201cSister!\u201d Xie Zhen and Yan Yu had originally planned to return to the Mansion but they didn\u2019t expect to meet them. Now, they couldn\u2019t even think of returning. \u201cAh Xun! Brother!\u201d When sisters met, they would inevitably have a lot to say.</p></blockquote><br/>\n</div>"}

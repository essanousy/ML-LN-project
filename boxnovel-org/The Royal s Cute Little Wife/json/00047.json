When she got herself measured, she realized she was a little taller than she had been before she came to capital.</p><br/><p>She was so happy that she hopped around the room, and her gloomy mood swept away. \u201cWho said I\u2019m not going to be tall? I\u2019m still growing up!\u201d</p><br/><p>The rest of the her body had yet to be measured out properly, but Madam Leng let her to stop for a moment. \u201cLook at how happy you are. You\u2019re getting married and yet you\u2019re still so restless.\u201d</p><br/><p>As soon as her mother mentioned marriage, her entire body withered, and she pouted her mouth in accusation. \u201cMother can\u2019t say anything good about me.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng let Shuang Li and Shuang Lu hold her down. The brocade shop owner measured her chest and waist. Looking at the bulging clothes on her chest, she was a little embarrassed and finally became quiet.</p><br/><p>When she reached her waist, she wrapped the soft ruler around her waist and made a small circle. Looking at the size, she couldn\u2019t help but praise her: \u201cFifth Miss\u2019 waist is really thin.\u201d</p><br/><p>The shop owner had noticed it when she measured her size. She was slender and well-proportioned at every turn.</p><br/><p>Considering that this was a girl from a noble family, there was one thing she didn\u2019t say in her heart, and that was \u201ca natural beauty.\u201d</p><br/><p>When a man touched this body, even his bones would be softened.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen measured it with her hand. She held it up in front of her face and thought it was more exaggerated than the shop owner had said.</p><br/><p>She had been depressed recently. She had eaten less than before, so of course she would be thinner. It was all because of this marriage!</p><br/><p>When the measure work was done, it was an hour later, and she lay exhausted on the chaise bed with her eyes closed for a moment.</p><br/><p>It was hot outside, so she couldn\u2019t be bothered to go out.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun probably knew that these last months with her sister were the last days, and she came to her room almost every day to pester her, either to chat with her or to embroider flowers together. She had never been docile before, and she even took out the dried fruit she had kept hidden for a long time to share with her.</p><br/><p>They had slept in the same bed when they were young, and had slept in separate beds since Xie Zhen was ten years old.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun wanted to get closer to her before she got married, but when she thought of that her sister would be someone else\u2019s, she became even more reluctant to part with her.</p><br/><p>\u201cOkay,\u201d Xie Zhen said happily, chewing on a winter melon.</p><br/><p>She might have disagreed before, for it was so hot, how could they sleep at night when they were stuck together and greasy?</p><br/><p>But she also knew she didn\u2019t have much time to spend with her, as Xie Xun had thought. She wouldn\u2019t refuse if her younger sister wanted to sleep with her.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun was overjoyed. She got up and was about to go back to her room to get her pillow. \u201cSis, wait for me!\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen held her face and reminded with a smile, \u201cRemember to take two more fans!\u201d</p><br/><p>There were these things in her room, but since Xie Xun was willing, she wouldn\u2019t stop her.</p><br/><p>On the table were the snacks Xie Xun had brought, including dried winter melon fruit, jujube fruit and preserved dark plum etc.</p><br/><p>Even Xie Zhen didn\u2019t know that this gluttonous ghost had secretly hidden so many desserts!</p><br/><p>\uff0c\uff0c\uff0c\u3002</p><br/><p>She used to share it with her as soon as she had something to eat. she thought angrily, and she had to eat them all, to make her feel even.</p><br/><p>Just as she was putting a preserved dark plum into her mouth, there was a sound from the door. She thought it was Xie Xun, so she opened her mouth and asked, \u201cHave you found the fan?\u201d</p><br/><p>There was no sound from the door. She looked up and saw Xie Ying standing at the doorway with a smile on her face.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth sister, it\u2019s me.\u201d</p><br/><p>If she had nothing to do, Xie Ying definitely wouldn\u2019t have come to the Jade Yard.</p><br/><p>Of course, she wouldn\u2019t come even if she had something to do.</p><br/><p>So when she appeared here, Xie Zhen was still a little surprised. She bit on the dried fruit and asked, \u201cWhy is third sister here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Ying walked over and sat down in front of her. She smiled and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t come here often before because I was busy.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou know that I need to learn my homework and my needlework, and I also need to learn the zither. Ever since you and Second Aunt returned from Qingzhou, I have been unable to find the time to come over.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cOh,\u201d Xie Zhen said, pushing the jujube in front of her out of politeness. \u201cWill you eat it?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cSo you came here today, it must be something very important, right?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Ying looked at the candied fruits on the plate. In order to maintain her stature, she hadn\u2019t eaten sweets for a long time.</p><br/><p>\u201cNo \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cI don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t force her. She asked Shuang Yu to bring two glasses of jujube juice, preferably ice-cooled.</p><br/><p>Unexpectedly, Xie Ying still refused to drink because the taste was too sweet.</p><br/><p>Then Xie Zhen left her alone and sat in her seat and ate her own, waiting for her to speak.</p><br/><p>Xie Ying forced a smile. She had always been bossy and proud before, and she had never been so nice to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cFifth sister is the first Golden Phoenix to fly out of our Mansion\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>She was actually complimenting Xie Zhen, but Xie Zhen was very uncomfortable, sitting on the cushion and twisting, thinking that she might as well be a bit mean to her.</p><br/><p>\u201cDon\u2019t say that, third sister.\u201d</p><br/><p>Could it be a courtesy before a soldier?</p><br/><p>She remembered that when the imperial edict passed down, Xie Ying looked at her with eyes that could tear her apart. Why did she change so much in just a few days?</p><br/><p>Xie Ying ignored her words and continued, \u201cAfter you marry the sixth prince, you will enjoy endless riches and glory, and your status will skyrocket to even greater heights.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cIn the future, when the sixth prince speaks up for Second Uncle in front of His Majesty again and awards him an official position or something like that, then the rest of your family will be boundless and free from worries about your food and clothing for the rest of your lives.\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201c\u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t much like her saying that, as if she\u2019d married Yan Yu just to get the benefits.</p><br/><p>Thus, she pursed her lips and did not reply.</p><br/><p>Xie Ying was a smart person. Seeing her displeasure, she didn\u2019t waste any more time on the topic and started to praise the advantages of the Yan Yu.</p><br/><p>\u201cThe sixth prince is valiant and fearless. He is the hero of a youth when he goes to battle \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cHe is so handsome. It is so lucky for Fifth sister to marry him \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>After listening for a long time, Xie Zhen still couldn\u2019t figure out what she was talking about. She asked slowly with her chin in her hands, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that the third sister also likes the sixth prince?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Ying waved her hands, indicating that she didn\u2019t have any good feelings towards the sixth prince. \u201cFifth sister, don\u2019t misunderstand me. I\u2019m just lamenting a little.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen nodded. \u201cIs that what third sisters came to me for?\u201d</p><br/><p>She said no, and finally got to the point. She asked the most perplexed question in her heart: \u201cCould it be that you have some sort of relationship with the sixth prince \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy did His Majesty give you to him?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWe only met once.\u201d</p><br/><p>She did not lie. Ever since she came to the capital, she had only met with Yan Yu once.</p><br/><p>Just the only meeting was enough to make the decision for the rest of his life.</p><br/><p>Xie Ying clearly didn\u2019t believe her. Her eyes inadvertently landed on her face. She didn\u2019t think that it was impossible \u2026</p><br/><p>Most men would probably be attracted to this face.</p><br/><p>She smiled again and said in a very friendly tone, \u201cNo matter what you say, Fifth sister will be a member of the royal family in the future \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cYou must not forget us sisters at home. \u201d</p><br/><p>At this point, Xie Zhen finally understood. It was hinting that she would help her, to make the second phoenix to fly up the branch.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen wanted to laugh, but she held it. \u201cDon\u2019t worry, third sister, how could I forget you guys. Even if I get married, I\u2019ll come back to visit you guys all the time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Ying didn\u2019t mean it that way. She was worried and but could not speak out frankly. \u201cIt\u2019s troublesome to come back often. If you want us, you can hold a family banquet at any time. Call a few more people, and we can all gather together.\u201d</p><br/><p>How could Xie Zhen not understand such an obvious hint? She was only pretending not to understand.</p><br/><p>To hold a banquet in the mansion and call them over, she might even meet nobles of the royal family who were on good terms with Yan Yu. If it did happen for times, wouldn\u2019t that make her a matchmaker?</p><br/><p>She sighed and finally understood why Xie Ying had come.</p><br/><p>On the surface, she was unable to refuse, so she perfunctorily replied, \u201cthird sister is right, but I can\u2019t decide on this matter. I need to discuss it with the sixth prince.\u201d</p><br/><p>A disappointed look appeared in Xie Ying\u2019s eyes as she forced a smile, \u201cFifth sister, you\u2019re right. Wait until you get married, then we can discuss this with His Highness.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she sat down for a while, unable to find a topic to talk about. Xie Ying got up to take her leave, then turned around to catch sight of Xie Xun standing underneath the down-to-ground openwork screen.</p><br/><p>Xie Ying jumped in fright, called out \u201cSixth sister\u201d and walked around her.</p><br/><p>Xie Xun, holding the pillow in one hand and the two fans in the other, quickly ran up to Xie Zhen. \u201csister, what did third sister talk to you?\u201d</p><br/><p>Noticing Xie Ying had already walked far away through the window, Xie Zhen said with a gentle smile, \u201cCome and use her spear to stab her shield.\u201d</p><br/><p>Half a month later, the Ministry of Rites brought people to the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion to give betrothal gifts.</p><br/><p>The betrothal gifts flowed like water, and after being carried for a full hour, the commoners outside the mansion began to count quietly. There were a total of a hundred and eight pieces of gifts.</p><br/><p>The style of the royal family was different. The crowd were in a daze, they all sighed at the good fortune of the fifth girl of the Duke Dingguo\u2019s Mansion.</p><br/><p>The Duke Dingguo asked the steward to lead people in through the back door and into the storehouse, where he would write down all the betrothal gifts and count them in the evening.</p><br/><p>In the evening, when they counted the boxes filled with things, they were simply dazzled.</p><br/><p>Jewellery, pearl agate, and treasured antiques, silks and brocades.</p><br/><p>All of them were of the finest quality. Even Duke Dingguo, who was used to experience kinds of big events, couldn\u2019t help but sigh with emotion. \u201cHis Majesty has truly put in a lot of effort.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was clear how much he doted on the sixth prince.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen didn\u2019t see the scene, but the first thing she thought about was not how valuable things were, but could they be recorded in the second branch?</p><br/><p>No matter what, it was a treasure that she had obtained from selling herself!</p><br/><p>Then she didn\u2019t think much about it, because the gown was already completed, and she was going to embroider a lily with her own hands on the collar.</p><br/><p>Her embroidery was not good, and it took several nights for her to make it look good.</p><br/><p>After finishing the embroidery, she tried the gown out and found that it was all of the right size. She asked the maidservants to put it away and waited to wear it on the day of the wedding.</p><br/><p>Time flew by, and in the blink of an eye, the summer heat passed and it turned into autumn.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

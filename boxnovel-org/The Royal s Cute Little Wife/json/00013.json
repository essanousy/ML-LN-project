She staggered a little before she managed to stabilize herself.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing didn\u2019t have time to care about her. He took a few steps forward and timidly stopped in front of Madam Leng. \u201cChanyu, I \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng looked at him and then at Qin Lou Yue, her lips curving into a meaningful smile. \u201cHow come I never knew you had a deep relationship with the imperial concubine?\u201d</p><br/><p>This flat and indifferent sentence made Xie Liqing\u2019s scalp tingle. He was most afraid of the neither hot nor cold of the Madam Leng. It made him feel as if he was being tortured in a frying pan, unable to move up. Sometimes he would rather she had a hysterical temper, or scolded him, and asked what was going on. However, she was not that kind of person. No matter how angry she was, she would only give you a cold look. Even though you didn\u2019t do anything bad, she would still look at you with a guilty conscience.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing repeatedly waved his hands as he tried to explain. \u201cI just came out of the study and happened to run into the imperial concubine on the way. I was just about to go find you when you came.\u201d</p><br/><p>It was obvious in Madam Leng\u2019s eyes that she did not believe him. She only said a few sentences. She\u2019s not blind.</p><br/><p>If nannie Chen hadn\u2019t gone to the main room to find her, she would\u2019ve been worried that something would happen to Madam Qin. Thus, she came to the study to discuss countermeasures with him, so how could she have bumped into the scene just now? Who would have thought that the concubine of Dongping wouldn\u2019t let go of her husband, that shocked Madam Leng.</p><br/><p>What did the two of them have that she didn\u2019t know about?</p><br/><p>Looking at the expression on Madam Qin\u2019s face, it seemed as though she had been wronged.</p><br/><p>Madam Qin was helped forward by the girl and stood behind Xie Liqing. She forced a smile. \u201cI only wanted to invite him to a snack in the pavilion because I happened to pass by this place and saw how hard he was working.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Leng lifted her lips and replied politely, \u201cToday, it\u2019s snowing heavily, and concubine won\u2019t pass by here when you return to your room. It seems that concubine has a great deal of leisure and elegance, which is why you happened to pass by.\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Qin\u2019s face stiffened and her smile almost died on her face.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng looked at Xie Liqing and coldly stared at him for a while. Xie Liqing almost couldn\u2019t resist it and wanted to admit his mistake, but a smile appeared in her eyes. \u201cThe concubine said you worked hard, but why didn\u2019t you tell me? If you really find it hard, I\u2019ll let a few maids serve you.\u201d</p><br/><p>Although she was smiling, her smile did not reach her eyes. There was a hint of anger and threat in her smile.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing had been with her husband for more than ten years, so how could he not know her temperament? If he dared to say yes, then he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to live a good life in the next few days. He shook his head. \u201cNo, no.\u201d \u201cHow could I possibly find it tiring to have my wife here?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhy do I remember that you don\u2019t like snack?\u201d</p><br/><p>He nodded approvingly. \u201cMy lady remembers well. I really don\u2019t like it.\u201d</p><br/><p>On the other side, Madam Qin\u2019s face was pale. It was even paler than the snowflakes falling from the sky. She stood in front of them, frowning in disbelief. \u201cCousin doesn\u2019t like snack?\u201d \u201cI remember that you used to like to eat the Sweet Sour Lotus Root Starch Cake the most. Every time I made it, you would always \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Today, she had borrowed the kitchen to make the Sweet Sour Lotus Root Starch Cake. She thought that he would really like it, but didn\u2019t think that he didn\u2019t even spare it a glance.</p><br/><p>He used to eat two more each time she made a cookie.</p><br/><p>Why now?</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing frowned. He was truly angry. They were people who had a family, why did they keep pestering each other like this? He said, \u201cThat was before. I don\u2019t like it anymore.\u201d \u201cconcubine, please go back sooner rather than later. You\u2019ve been out for so long, so it\u2019s still somewhat inappropriate.\u201d</p><br/><p>After speaking, he took his wife and daughter and was about to leave. But before he could take two steps, the Madam Qin refused to give up and actually tried to stop them.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen had been curious for a long time. She stood in front of Madam Leng and Xie Liqing, raising her young and snow-white face. \u201cIs the concubine of Dongping\u2019s king?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Qin looked down at her and nodded slowly.</p><br/><p>She was even more curious. She tilted her head and blinked her large eyes. \u201cThen why don\u2019t you accompany King of Dongping instead of accompanying my father?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Qin was speechless.</p><br/><p>No one answered her, and she waited anxiously and expectantly for Madam Qin to answer. After a long while, when she still hadn\u2019t gotten an answer, she pursed her lips in frustration. She recalled the scene she saw at the beginning, \u201cYou\u2019re even holding my father\u2019s hand, why are you holding my father\u2019s hand? My father\u2019s hand can only be held by my mother.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she said that, she turned around and grabbed the hands of Madam Leng and Xie Liqing with her chubby hands. She then placed them together and said, \u201cThis is how it should be!\u201d</p><br/><p>She smiled contentedly, a smile as bright as a flower in the winter snow.</p><br/><p>That smile stabbed into Madam Qin\u2019s eyes, hurting her. She helplessly watched as Xie Liqing held onto Madam Leng and the little girl as they walked further and further away. Their family of three blended in with the music, making her seem even more lonely.</p><ul><li></li><li></li></ul><br/><p>When they walked through the moon gate that Madam Qin could not see, Madam Leng decisively shook off Xie Liqing\u2019s hand.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He wanted to hold her hand again, but she dodged it.</p><br/><p>He suddenly had a bad feeling and turned to look at the Madam Leng. She looked at him calmly, a sneer on her lips as she asked slowly, \u201cCousin?\u201d</p><br/><p>He had a terrible headache.</p><br/><p>After some thought, Leng said word by word, \u201cAnd you like Sweet Sour Lotus Root Starch Cake the most?\u201d</p><br/><p>It seemed that if he didn\u2019t speak honestly, he wouldn\u2019t be able to pass this trial today. For a moment, Xie Liqing didn\u2019t know where to start. He had never told the Madam Leng about this past. After all, he was a little tempted when he was young, so he couldn\u2019t bring himself to speak. Moreover, ever since he had married her, he had experienced so many things. He liked her more and more day by day, and compared to those cousins, their relationship were even more insignificant.</p><br/><p>He didn\u2019t say it out loud because he felt that it wasn\u2019t necessary. After all, it had been so long. If it wasn\u2019t for the King of Dongping bringing Madam Qin here, he probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to remember.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing softened his tone and tried his best to coax her, \u201cThat\u2019s all in the past. When have I ever eaten a candy cake?\u201d Chanyu, what do I think of you? Don\u2019t you know \u2026?</p><br/><p>Leng Shi gave him a sidelong glance. \u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>He choked and was about to answer when he looked down and saw the little Xie Zhen listening to him.</p><br/><p>Seeing Xie Liqing stop talking, she quickly pulled on his clothes and asked, \u201cDaddy, what are you thinking?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing immediately realized that he had lost his aged face. He waved his hand to chase her away. \u201cYoung children, you are not allowed to listen to adults speak.\u201d</p><br/><p>As she spoke, she told nannie Chen to pick her up and carry her back inside.</p><br/><p>Before she had heard enough, she squirmed on nannie Chen\u2019s shoulder and was taken away, though she didn\u2019t want to.</p><br/><p>The only people left in the courtyard were the Madam Leng and Xie Liqing. When Madam Leng saw him, they didn\u2019t say a word, implying: Speak then.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing coughed. In the courtyard, countless pairs of eyes were watching him. He felt that it was detrimental to his dignity to express his feelings to his wife in public. He wanted to bring Leng back into the house, but she was much more stubborn than him.</p><br/><p>He could only say, \u201cBesides the two girls, I only have you as my only woman in my heart \u2026\u201d</p><ul><li></li><li></li></ul><br/><p>The snow fell all night, and the next day the yard was covered with snow.</p><br/><p>Xie Zhen and Xie Xun made a snowman together. Xie Zhen stood on a foot-stool, and tried to plug a carrot nose to the snowman. Xie Xun shouted suddenly, making Xie Zhen falling off from the foot-stool.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat are you shouting at?\u201d she asked her sister angrily as she sat in the snow covered in snow.</p><br/><p>Xie Xian pointed to the front courtyard and suddenly remembered. \u201cThe king is leaving today \u2026\u201d</p><br/><p>Let\u2019s go, Xie Zhen thought. Anyway, that concubine angered the mother, so it\u2019s better if she left. She patted the snow off her body and stood up again. \u201cYou\u2019re going to help me this time.\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xun nodded his head, no longer daring to shout.</p><br/><p>They made snowmen in the backyard, and the adults saw them off in the front yard.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing and Madam Leng personally escorted King of Dongping to the door and said some polite words, then gave him some blankets and mattresses. Only then did they get him and Madam Qin onto the carriage. During this time, Xie Liqing didn\u2019t even glance at the Qin family. On the other hand, Madam Qin\u2019s eyes were red, and she kept her head down the entire time without saying a word.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng discovered that she wasn\u2019t carrying a child today. When she looked back, she saw a nannie carrying a swaddling cloth in her arms. Presumably, it was her child.</p><br/><p>King of Dongping was the first to step into the carriage and wave goodbye to Xie Liqing. He glanced at Madam Qin, who was sitting beneath the carriage, and a dark light flashed across his eyes. Suddenly, he teased her: \u201cWhat, don\u2019t you want to stay here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Madam Qin quickly shook her head and stepped onto the yellow wooden bench to get on the carriage.</p><br/><p>King of Dongping didn\u2019t say much, but his attitude towards her was much worse than yesterday.</p><br/><p>This caused the Madam Leng to think more. Could it be that he knew something? However, his attitude towards Xie Liqing was very courteous and courteous. It was no different from yesterday\u2019s, causing people to feel suspicious.</p><br/><p>As the carriage drew farther and farther away, Xie Liqing took off his cloak and draped it over the Madam Leng before leading her back into the house. \u201cLet\u2019s quickly head back. Don\u2019t stand here and catch a cold.\u201d</p><br/><p>As they walked, Madam Leng asked, \u201cHow is the relationship between King Dongping and the princess?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing said, \u201cI don\u2019t know about that \u2026.\u201d \u201cHowever, I heard that Dongping empress\u2019 personality is quite resolute and decisive, and that she treated the entire manor with subservience.\u201d</p><br/><p>She had a fierce personality, but her temper was quite straightforward. There was not even a speck of sand in her eyes.</p><br/><p>Yesterday, after listening to Xie Liqing\u2019s explanation, Madam Leng had been puzzled. Why did she want to go back when she had squeezed her head to enter the royal palace with so much difficulty? From the looks of it, Madam Qin must have suffered a lot from Dongping Empress and found it difficult to get along with her. Only then did he remember how good Xie Liqing was.</p><br/><p>Madam Leng glanced at Xie Liqing, her gaze clearly doubting his gaze.</p><br/><p>Xie Liqing immediately tried to curry favor with her. He really loved her. Despite being in the courtyard, he lowered his head and sucked her lips. \u201cRight now, your husband only likes you. You\u2019re the only person in his heart.\u201d</p><br/><p>Leng\u2019Er let out a soft groan as she bit her lips.</p><ul><li></li><li></li></ul><br/><p>In the backyard, Xie Zhen and Xie Xian, with Xie Rong\u2019s help, finally made a snowman.</p><br/><p>The snowman also wore a Xie Zhen\u2019s swan fur hat, with round face plate, two black eyes and red lips. Xie Zhen pointed to the snowman and said, \u201cDoes it look like Ah Xun?\u201d</p><br/><p>Xie Xian pursed his lips. \u201cI should miss her.\u201d</p><br/><p>They talked for a long time about who the snowman looked like. One said it looked like Ah Xun, one said it looked like an older sister, and in the end neither of them could come to a conclusion. She turned and ran to the verandah, the soft suede boots making a thumping sound on the planks. \u201cI\u2019ll ask mother to take a look!\u201d</p><br/><p>With that, she ran to the Leng Residence\u2019s main building.</p><br/><p>There were no maidservants at the door. She pushed twice but didn\u2019t manage to open it. The door was locked from the inside. Curious, she knocked on the door. \u201cMother?\u201d</p><br/><p>But no one answered.</p><br/><p>She was about to call out again when she heard a strange sound coming from inside. She put her ear to the fan and heard only a low wheeze and a low moan from her mother.</p><br/><p>What was that sound?</p><br/><p>She was curious and wanted to hear more, but she was picked up by Shuang Yu. Shuang Yu\u2019s face turned red as she carried her away from the door. \u201cSecond Miss, Young Master Li has come to see you.\u201d</p><br/><p>When she looked up, she saw Li Yu, in a black fur cloak, standing on the other side of the portico, looking at her with a small, white face.</p><br/>\n</div>"}

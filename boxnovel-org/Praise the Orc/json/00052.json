It passed through Anail, Arnin, and Chesswood to the centre of the continent. He was now stronger than anyone who wasn\u2019t a ranker.</span></p><br/><p><span>He also got revenge on the Thawing Balhae Clan. There would be a little delay as he searched for Hyunchul and the clan leader, but the crippling blow to the Thawing Balhal Clan had already been dealt.</span></p><br/><p><span>He could now work on the reason why he began playing this game.\u00a0</span><span>The reason he started playing the game was for his sister Jung Yiyu. Her character was in the center of the continent, at one of the starting points for elves.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is the reason why I am playing the game, for Yiyu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian hummed before suddenly stopping.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>This wasn\u2019t something he normally did.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had hummed unconsciously because Jeremy was always making noises beside him. It was just like Iron, F4 the roleplaying group, and the orcs who played the game. Meeting all of those people had changed Ian in real life.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian started laughing.\u00a0</span><span>Change. It wasn't a bad feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span>He stretched, afraid of becoming unhealthy after spending so much time in Elder Lord. He needed to move his body properly. Ian slowly moved.\u00a0</span><span>By the way, his body was softer than he thought.\u00a0</span><span>No, rather, it seemed more flexible than before.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian cocked his head. Somehow, strength was overflowing in him. What was this? Ian looked down at his hands before suddenly falling face-down to the ground. He put weight on both hands in a push-up stance and then slowly lifted his lower body from the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s mouth dropped open.\u00a0</span><span>It was a success.\u00a0</span><span>This type of body movement was called a Planche. He supported his body with only his arms and formed a straight position in the air, like Superman.</span></p><br/><p><span>He hadn\u2019t thought that it would be possible after not exercising for a while. However, it actually seemed easier than before. Ian got up and pondered over his body. Maybe it was thanks to Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a similar reaction as one conducted image training, so maybe Elder Lord had that effect on the body as well.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian showered and left home. After dropping off some food at the caf\u00e9 for Han Yeori and Yoo Sooyeon, he headed to Yiyu\u2019s university. It was lunch time so he thought he would buy her something delicious.</span></p><br/><p><span>He contacted her and told her to wait in front of the cafeteria.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOppa.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou came?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They entered the cafeteria.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian ordered a set of sushi and noodles. Yiyu loved sushi. When she was young, she had been impressed by the classic cartoon, \u2018Mister Sushi King\u2019, and dreamed of being a chef. Of course, she gave it up after realizing that she had no talent in cooking.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy did you come here all of a sudden? And you\u2019re buying the meal as well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It isn\u2019t sudden, I\u2019ve bought you a lot of meals.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You haven\u2019t done it lately, so I thought you didn\u2019t care about your little sister anymore. Have you been busy meeting that pretty sister?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian smiled and poked Yiyu\u2019s forehead with his fingers. She frowned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDoes it hurt?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It hurts,\u201d Yiyu complained, and moving her gaze to her phone. </span><span>She seemed to be messaging someone. Ian touched his chin.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was good enough.</span></p><br/><p><span>One year ago, Yiyu had been awkward with Ian.\u00a0</span><span>It had been seven years.</span></p><br/><p><span>As soon as he became an adult, he received an exemption from military service due to having a minor dependent on him. He was then sent to the foreign troops through Baek Hanho\u2019s recommendation.</span></p><br/><p><span>He sent and received letters, but he hadn\u2019t been able to communicate with her properly due to the circumstances of his unit, the time difference, and security issues. Yiyu was left at a relative\u2019s home and Ian supported her living expenses and tuition. Yiyu wasn\u2019t bullied, but she also didn\u2019t receive any love.</span></p><br/><p><span>When Ian was discharged and returned to Korea last year, the 13 year old child had already become an adult.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu was unfamiliar with Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>She told her brother, whom she hadn\u2019t met in seven years, that she would get a job as soon as she graduated high school so that he didn\u2019t need to worry about her. It was regrettable, considering their past relationship, so he just told her to go to the school that she wanted to go to.</span></p><br/><p><span>His father had always said to him, </span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Mother and Father are busy, so you have to protect your little sister. A brother and sister should be closer with each other than with their parents. You have to depend on each other until you die. It is the deepest family connection. So...\u00a0</span><span>You must protect Yiyu.\u00a0</span><span>I believe in you.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Then there was his parents\u2019 funeral, who had died without even leaving a will. Ian didn\u2019t cry. He smiled and made a pledge towards his father\u2019s photo. \u2018I won\u2019t let you down.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He sometimes doubted if he was meeting his father\u2019s expectations, but the resolution of that time still remained in his chest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oppa, why are you smiling like that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I-It hurts!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Sometimes that resolution was shaken.\u00a0</span><span>The meal arrived and Yiyu started eating the sushi.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow\u2019s school?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"And your course feels right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo... I don't know.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Yiyu sighed.\u00a0</span><span>\"Oppa, sometimes I wonder about my dream. I thought that I\u2019d find it in the economics department, but I don\u2019t know anymore.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Wasn\u2019t it to become the sushi king?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, not that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You should do what you want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I can\u2019t always do what I want. I need talent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTalent?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. For example, even if all soccer players practice, that doesn\u2019t mean they will be like Pele, Ronaldo, Maradona, and Messi.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian laughed. Yiyu raised her eyebrows.\u00a0</span><span>\"What, what?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is no need to be the best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There are plenty of soccer players out there. You don\u2019t have to be the best. Even if you can\u2019t play, you can open a soccer school and coach. Or you can open a neighborhood gym.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You should just be happy as you do what you want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu looked at Ian with a strange expression before going back to swallowing her sushi. </span><span>She gasped, \u201cAh, wasabi, wasabi. Spicy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian handed her some water which calmed her down as she drank the water.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But Oppa, what if I don\u2019t know what I like?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou don\u2019t know?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yeah, I don't know. Under these circumstances, it looks like I just have to live and die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou always say that it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you want to live roughly, than you should just do it. No one will scold you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You scold me for my failing grades.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That\u2019s a formality.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then I\u2019ll keep doing it in the future, okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, yes.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No no no.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Che.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The two concentrated on their meal for a while. It was delicious. Ian decided to come here with his part time workers next time.\u00a0</span><span>Ian cut to the chase.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You, how is Elder Lord?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian coughed.\u00a0</span><span>\"Hmm, I\u2019m actually...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I quit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Very high...what?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I quit Elder Lord.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at Yiyu. She didn\u2019t even look at Ian as she slurped her udon.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI won\u2019t play anymore.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian hesitated because her face seemed really determined.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhy all of a sudden?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI just did.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian recalled a childhood memory.</span></p><br/><p><span>Whenever something bad happened, Yiyu would stay quiet at home. Ian would ask what happened, and she wouldn\u2019t reply. Ian always had to coax the details out of her. If he kept asking, then she would eventually confess. </span></p><br/><p><span>As Ian looked at her glum expression, he couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhat's going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I just don\u2019t want to do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTell me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As soon as Yiyu closed her mouth, Ian grabbed her favorite tuna from the sushi set.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, what the?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You can\u2019t eat until you speak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, why? How petty. Gimme.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOkay, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian gave her the tuna back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s just scary.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cScary?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu was scared and weak. As she had told her friends, she had died to a rabbit. Therefore, she became a mystic to obtain spirits and carefreely roam around the world. One day, she encountered a group of users.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were high level players that were normally not seen in the beginner\u2019s area. They noticed that she was shearing sheep alone with her spirits and approached. They told her that they were high level users, and that they would help her raise her level.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu rejected, but they kept at it, quickly becoming angry at her clear refusal.</span></p><br/><p><span>Before attacking her, they exclaimed, \"Ah, fuck. This bitch must have spent a lot of money on her customization. Does she think she\u2019s a real elf or something?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu ran away as they laughed and chased her, as if they were hunting deer. Her spirits resisted, but they were eventually sent back to the spirit world, leaving Yiyu to fend for herself.\u00a0</span><span>Her assimilation rate was only 10%, so she didn\u2019t feel a lot of pain. However, after being tied up like a hunted animal, she didn\u2019t want to play Elder Lord anymore.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m so sad about my poor kids being attacked,\u201d Yiyu said. </span><span>She called the spirits her kids.\u00a0</span><span>\"At any rate, I don\u2019t want to play anymore because there are many strange people. I apologize for forcing Oppa to play and then quitting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy are you sorry? It\u2019s okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oppa shouldn\u2019t play as well. Elder Lord is too tough. Don\u2019t play that tough game and remain a caf\u00e9 boss.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian laughed. His sister didn\u2019t seem to know that he was the toughest person around.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Where were you?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Was it Maillard? Oppa, this is delicious. I want more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ll go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He ordered more sushi for Yiyu.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian remembered the name Maillard. He also got a description of her attackers\u2019 appearances and some other information from Yiyu. The only reason she told him all this was because he had added more tuna sushi to the plate.</span></p><br/><p><span>Maillard was a city of elves located a little further from where Crockta currently was. Unlike Arnin, it was a place where other species were free to enter. Elves were able to choose from a variety of starting points, unlike the orcs. Maillard was a favorite starting point among beginners.</span></p><br/><p><span>He would show them the wrath of an orc warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yiyu?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Someone suddenly called out her name. Ian raised his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu replied, \"Uh, Yunji.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWow, I didn\u2019t expect to see you here. Are you eating lunch?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. You as well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. It has been a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Yiyu\u2019s friend. She glanced at Ian.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIs he your boyfriend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No, my brother.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBrother? Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She looked at both Ian and Yiyu.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou do look alike. Hello, I am Yiyu\u2019s friend, Jung Yunji.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHello. I am Yiyu\u2019s older brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian greeted her. He spoke politely since she was Yiyu\u2019s friend. She came with another party, so a group of girls were waiting for her. Jung Yunji said goodbye to Yiyu and turned away.\u00a0</span><span>But Jung Yunji looked strangely familiar to Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>Her face was familiar. Her grouchy face complaining to Ian seemed to pop into his head for some reason. Ian frowned. Who was it? Where did he see her?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh. I hate carrots.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu spat out a piece of carrot as she ate the udon.</span></p><br/><p><span>Carrot.\u00a0</span><span>Carrot...</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Bah, will Ian\u2019s strength make a difference?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Will it turn carrots into beef? You would be a wealthy merchant.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Those words suddenly popped into his head.\u00a0</span><span>Ian looked back. \u00a0</span><span>He caught Jung Yunji\u2019s eyes as her friend nagged her.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She looked embarrassed by Ian\u2019s gaze and turned slightly pink. She shyly bowed her head and tucked her hair behind her ears.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why are you staring, are you interested in her?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Yiyu asked sharply. Ian shook his head and turned forward again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then what is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShe looks familiar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu made a questioning sound, but Ian just put the sushi in his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>It was obvious why.\u00a0</span><span>He actually met her in reality, so he couldn\u2019t help feeling goosebumps.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>But somehow, it felt like the back of his head was stinging.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule: \u00a0<strong>Another Patreon goal has been reached!!

He would\u2019ve been the best if it wasn\u2019t for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. He and I are different. To say who is better...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou're the best.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>The man laughed.\u00a0</span><span>There was a cheering sound from the next table. Tanned men and women gathered while enjoying the music.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIsn\u2019t the atmosphere good?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man picked up some fries and put them in his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cAnyway, you are the best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked around. It didn\u2019t feel like a suspicious situation. He drank the beer and pretended to be unconcerned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat reminds me, how much is a surfboard? If it is fun, I should buy one.\u201d Ian</span><span>\u00a0threw out some meaningless words while thinking of a few possibilities in his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span>First of all, the man might be related to the Heaven and Earth. He might\u2019ve appeared for Keynes\u2019 revenge. However, that didn\u2019t fit.\u00a0</span><span>No one knew Ian would come here. Additionally, this guy seemed to have already been here for a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span>Maybe he was an acquaintance of Ji Hayeon? The game publisher might\u2019ve finally figured out Crockta\u2019s identity through the Elder Lord system and informed him.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man stared at Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow clever. But I don\u2019t like this. Just ask, who am I?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNot doing what the opponent expects. Did you learn that in the Middle East?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian knocked at the table with his fingertips.\u00a0</span><span>The feeling of being caught was always unpleasant. Ian detected danger, so he tried to break the rhythm of the opponent. To do so, he always ignored what the enemy expected.</span></p><br/><p><span>If they expected an attack, stay in place. If they expected a defense, strike forward.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t want to give a reaction that the opponent expected.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>However, this time, there wasn\u2019t enough information. So, Ian just asked him.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLook, this is how easy it is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man smiled and drank his beer.\u00a0</span><span>The two people had a light toast and looked at each other while drinking their beer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEat the snack as well. Otherwise, I am the only one eating.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He ordered more beer and ate the fries again.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYour presence was truly unexpected. I never expected it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m talking about Elder Lord. I didn\u2019t expect a person like you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Ian realized who this person was.\u00a0</span><span>Ian\u2019s quiet eyes stared at the man, who looked different from the photo. The man was tanned, and his hair and eyebrows were strangely white.\u00a0</span><span>He had muscles, unlike his skinny appearance back then. The changes were so diverse that he never imagined it would be the face from that photo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYoo Jaehan?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man closed his eyes and smiled.\u00a0</span><span>It was the man who made Elder Lord, the man who developed the core system, Albino.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s face stiffened.\u00a0</span><span>Ian had wanted to meet this man, but he couldn\u2019t figure out what to say now.\u00a0</span><span>Did Yoo Jaehan know about the gray god or that Elder Lord was another world?\u00a0</span><span>It felt like his soul was rising from his body, and he was losing his sense of reality. Maybe everything he went through was just a dream, and Elder Lord was actually just a game.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou already know. Have you been searching for me all over the place?\u201d Yoo Jaehan asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMaybe I should\u2019ve checked here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, I suppose.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Then Yoo Jaehan suddenly said,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThat woman likes you a lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Multiple faces entered Ian\u2019s eyes, then they were erased. However, Yoo Jaehan noticed his expression and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWho are you thinking of? Are there many people like that around you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere was also that girl earlier. How sinful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The new beer was a little different. Yoo Jaehan nodded as he drank.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFor Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The two clinked their cups together. As Ian placed his cup to his mouth and sipped, Yoo Jaehan suddenly asked,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI heard you met Albino?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s throat spasmed when he heard that, but he managed to calm down.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDrink slowly. Don\u2019t choke.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c</span><i><span>Cough, cough.</span></i><span> Albino...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe white woman, the gray god...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Jaehan already knew about the gray god.\u00a0</span><span>Ian put the beer down and calmed himself. This was the man who made Elder Lord. It was obvious that he was related to the matter.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Jaehan was a physicist. Did he link the two worlds by joining forces with the gray god and using an unknown theory?\u00a0</span><span>If so, why did he make Elder Lord? What was the real purpose of the gray god?</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian said,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI met her. I also heard that Elder Lord is another world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Jaehan nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI guess so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is Elder Lord? Why did you make it, and what is the gray god\u2019s purpose?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf I tell you one thing,...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou should tell me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Jaehan looked upwards. He seemed to be thinking of something.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour name is Jung Ian?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHave you ever looked up at the night sky?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He reached out.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt is dark in Korea, but there are numerous stars in the sky. Have you ever looked up at the sky from the desert?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI have.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow was it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBeautiful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt wasn't scary?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He smiled faintly at Ian.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIsn\u2019t it scary to imagine the vast universe that stretches between the stars and us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI haven\u2019t thought of that so far.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAll of them will cool down in the end.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Yoo Jaehan seemed to be touching on the idea of the abyss, which had been conveyed by the gray god and the demon belt.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cEntropy can\u2019t be reversed. Forever.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This also went along with Gordon\u2019s story.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe sun, the stars, and the many galaxies in the universe will eventually cool down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat does that have to do with Elder Lord?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlbino was thinking about this before me. So, she found me and told me there was a way out. Then I helped her make Elder Lord.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMaybe it was a good choice,\u201d he added on, muttering.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at Yoo Jaehan and realized this genius was different from ordinary people.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cDid you create it in order to prevent the destruction of the universe?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSomething like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Jaehan was afraid of a future that wouldn\u2019t happen in this life but in later generations.\u00a0</span><span>The idea overflowed in his head, and he couldn\u2019t think of anything else.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow can she prevent the destruction?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don't know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou just believed her and created Elder Lord?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShe is a god. I could only believe it after meeting her. She used incomprehensible powers. But it is bigger than I thought.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPeople think it is just a game and are killing others. Don\u2019t you feel guilty?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Jaehan looked at Ian with calm eyes.\u00a0</span><span>They seemed emotionless.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey are people who will die anyway.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean they need to be killed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEveryone dies. They will live for less than 100 years. So, why does it matter?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is up to here. I\u2019ve told you enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCan you stop Elder Lord...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat was Albino\u2019s purpose?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you? It is up to here. The rest you can figure out yourself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Jaehan\u2019s expression was firm.\u00a0</span><span>Ian struggled with two options: leave now; or try to make him say more. Maybe Ian could even use some force.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The latter was the more interesting choice, but he was no longer Raven. There were many questions he wanted to ask, but he decided to just nod.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWell, I suppose it doesn't matter. I am thinking about doing it in moderation now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you thinking about stopping Elder Lord?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI think I will soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian recalled when he had been Crockta and received a 100% assimilation rate.</span></p><br/><p><span>In that moment, he really had been Crockta, and his mindset had been that of an orc warrior. He had no fear. For him, even dying was an honor. He\u2019d been willing to stand alone on the battlefield despite the risk of death.\u00a0</span><span>At the time, he didn\u2019t worry about his surroundings. The most important thing was the battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, that wasn\u2019t the case.\u00a0</span><span>Yiyu was still young, and he was her guardian. Cafe Reason was also his responsibility. He couldn\u2019t consider only himself when it came to his death.</span></p><br/><p><span>When he disconnected and returned to being Ian, he regretted the thoughts and actions he had made when being Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>If he continued with Elder Lord, that would keep happening in the future.\u00a0</span><span>He needed to refrain from that, for Yiyu\u2019s sake. In the end, the empire had been blocked. There was no need to get entangled with dangerous beings or the gray god.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI hope it can be like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBy the way, you\u2019re here. But Elder Saga Corporation has been looking for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey are bad at their jobs. Albino has also been helping.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHave you been here the whole time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. I just came to empty my head, but it was fun. The sea and the people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ji Hayeon, the heir of the Myeongsong Group, was sure that Yoo Jaehan wasn\u2019t in Korea.\u00a0</span><span>However, he was at a beach resort in Gangwon-do, and his body looked better than before.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian started laughing.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHow did you know I would be here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a coincidence. I was also surprised.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo scientists believe in coincidence?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou never know. The more I dig, the more amazing the world is. I believe in coincidences.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was difficult to believe.\u00a0</span><span>However, Yoo Jaehan seemed to have stayed here for a while. The people from the surf store knew him well.\u00a0</span><span>It was a purely impromptu idea that Ian had decided to go here, so it was a coincidence they met. Ian decided to be convinced.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Jaehan rose from his seat.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhere to...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is a vacation. Go out and enjoy it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They left the store.\u00a0</span><span>It was summer, so the days were long. There was still a dim light coming from the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCall that girl.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGirl?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe girl who hit you during the day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don't want to. I don\u2019t even remember her number.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI do.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Yoo Jaehan grabbed his phone. Ian stopped smiling as Yoo Jaehan entered the number and hit the call button.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA follow-up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is okay. By the way, do you really remember it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At the time, the woman had only said her number once. On the contrary, Ian had repeated his number several times.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI have a high IQ. I remember everything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is. A man shouldn\u2019t be shy. Otherwise, how will you be popular?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the problem...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Ian\u2019s phone rang.\u00a0</span><span>It was a familiar number.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Jaehan laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWomen are more active in this world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Jaehan lay on the hammock and stared at the sea as he waited for Ian to return to his accommodations.\u00a0</span><span>The lights from ships shone on the horizon as\u00a0</span><span>the sea breeze blew.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Jaehan shook his body on the hammock and felt the rhythm.\u00a0</span><span>He closed his eyes and whispered,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDid you send him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was no answer. Yoo Jaehan asked again,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cAlbino, did you send him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt's a coincidence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He opened his eyes. There was a fuzzy shape by his side.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe decided to come by himself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou helped him make that decision. Using your power, you can project any image into his imagination. No?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI haven\u2019t seen you in a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The white, fuzzy shape revolved around him and said, </span><span>\u201cIt will be soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo soon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt will be soon thanks to Ian.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t know anything, but he is helping you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is an inevitable flow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yoo Jaehan got up from the hammock and stared up at the sky.\u00a0</span><span>There weren\u2019t many stars at the beach. Still, he could imagine the vast landscape beyond it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeep your promise.\u201d He demanded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI think you are insane.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am a genius.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian appeared in the distance.\u00a0</span><span>Yoo Jaehan waved towards the distant Ian, and the blurry cloud hid behind Yoo Jaehan. Her image disappeared within a short time.</span></p><br/><p><span>He could feel her disappearing and muttered,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cGeniuses are never sane.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Yoo Jaehan\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u00a0</span><span>Ian neared him, but Ian wasn\u2019t coming alone.\u00a0</span><span>A woman was with him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs this youth?\u201d</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

At the center of the storm was a furious arrow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWaaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo barely avoided the arrow but he fell into the forest in the aftermath of the storm. The whirlwind swept the spot where Tiyo had been standing.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo lay down in the collapsed wreckage of the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Anor froze.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTiyo!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo was lying down like he was dead. His fingertips moved. His eyelids shook before he slowly opened his eyes. Tiyo staggered as he raised his body.\u00a0</span><span>He was still holding onto General tightly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t interfere </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo glared at the goblin. The goblin still had a relaxed expression on his face. Rather, this time he raised a hand like he was yielding.\u00a0</span><span>It provoked Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You might be confident but I am a gnome soldier from Quantes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo aimed General\u2019s muzzle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You will regret the day you upset me </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But the goblin didn\u2019t care. He just laughed at Tiyo. The ridiculing smile of the goblin further stimulated Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>The goblin frowned and said to Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let\u2019s go, garrison gnome, I\u2019ll make you regret it kyak! Don\u2019t just talk with your mouth kyahahak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo rushed forward and fired General.\u00a0</span><span>It was an assault meant to contain the enemy while he approached. But the goblin didn\u2019t allow him to get closer.\u00a0</span><span>It was like teleportation as the goblin moved backward, sideways and even over some trees. Every time Tiyo\u2019s barrage stopped, the goblin fired an arrow.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo avoided any fatal shots but the arrows tore his skin. The number of wounds gradually increased.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuock...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo stared at the wound on his arm with wild eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I have to acknowledge your confidence despite your lack of skills kyahahak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Your shooting skills are the worst kyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo\u2019s hands shook.\u00a0</span><span>He was the best shooter in Quantes. He had been recognized as the best every time he fired. Yet this goblin was hurting his pride.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\"Okay, Goblin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He moved his feet until they were shoulder width apart and stood firmly on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let me give you a taste of my shooting </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is in vain kyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo\u2019s General aimed at the goblins. The goblin also aimed at Tiyo with his arrow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Never interfere </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The situation had become worse than he thought so Crockta had tried to intervene with his greatsword. However, Tiyo had a determined expression on his face.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was forced to take a step back.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, the wind blew.\u00a0</span><span>The Black Forest shook.\u00a0</span><span>The wind twisted the branches. The leaves fell to the floor.\u00a0</span><span>The leaves fell down between Tiyo and the goblin.\u00a0</span><span>Like a joke of fate, the leaves passed through the point where they were aiming.\u00a0</span><span>The moment that their view of each other was blocked...</span></p><br/><p><span>The arrows and bullets fired towards each other.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Susususuk.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Shyaaaaaah!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>At the same time, the goblin and Tiyo\u2019s body twisted.\u00a0</span><span>The arrow narrowly passed by Tiyo\u2019s cheek.\u00a0</span><span>The magic bullet passed by the goblin\u2019s side and broke the tree.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>None of his bullets touched the goblin. The goblin laughed and did a thumbs down towards Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is the difference between you and me kyak.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin laughed.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Jeeeok.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The tree that Tiyo\u2019s magic bullet broke started to tilt slowly. The tree cast a shadow over the goblin. The goblin\u2019s face stiffened.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo said.\u00a0</span><span>\"Goblin, you might have learned the official language but...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo imitated the goblin\u2019s actions by lowering his thumb.\u00a0</span><span>At the same time, the tree slammed into the goblin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It seems like you haven\u2019t learned physics </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin moaned as it was crushed by the tree.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>They passed through the Black Forest and met many monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was an ogre who learned martial arts, the goblin archer was followed by a lich who summoned skeleton warriors, there was a troll that skillfully wielded a giant axe, a ninja direwolf who struck in the darkness and a lizardman who used a spear. They had to deal with all types of enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span>All of them weren\u2019t ordinary monsters. They all had unique skills, like specialists pursuing their own roads.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The Black Forest is a really strange place...\u201d muttered Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span> He had just knocked out a kobold archer.\u00a0</span><span>The kobold was a bipedal creature with the head of a dog, and it hid in various parts of the forest and fired at them before hiding again. One would be okay, but there were many of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo used his sophisticated shooting to hit the real one and the illusions. In the end, the kobold had admitted defeat after being hit and collapsing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Doesn\u2019t it seem like we\u2019re being tested </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The level of the creatures kept increasing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What type of hermit is living in a place like the Black Forest?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Be careful. It\u2019s time for new enemies to emerge.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Uhh...I\u2019m scared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They had walked for a long time after suppressing the kobold. According to the pattern, it was time for someone new to appear and stop them.\u00a0</span><span>What type of enemy would it be this time?\u00a0</span><span>They felt a mix of expectations and tiredness. They moved slowly through the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>An unfamiliar landscape appeared in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You came up to here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A young man was sitting in a rocking chair and reading a book. He glanced at Crockta\u2019s party over his spectacles. It was a young man with pitch black hair.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It has been a long time since I\u2019ve had visitors.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At first, his appearance looked like an elf, but this man had a face that was a level higher than that. He put away his book and rose from his seat. A beautiful man.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>He placed the book on his chest and said, \u201cThen I will ask a question.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s groups looked at each other at the sudden words. He continued speaking.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I had a dream a long time ago.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was suddenly a story about a dream. They were silent as they listened to the man\u2019s voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"In the dream, I was a father with a son. He was a lovely son, and I felt like I could give everything in the world for him. Then one day, I found out that my child was sick. He was struck with a terminal illness that would slowly but surely lead to his death.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>His face and voice were calm.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was such a scary disease that I thought it was a \u2018promised death\u2019. My child\u2019s death was promised and no one could avoid it. It was the worst illness that caused terrible pain that no one could bear. That's why I decided. Rather than let my son die in agony, it was better for me to end his life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man closed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But when I talked about this, everybody called me crazy. This was because there were few people who know about the \u2018promised death.\u2019 I said everything was for my child, but they didn\u2019t listen to me and exiled me so that I couldn\u2019t see my son. It was a thorough isolation. Now I will ask.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They couldn\u2019t figure out what he would ask. Crockta listened closely.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man asked, \"What do you think about me in the dream?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a comprehensive question.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t ask if what he thought was right or wrong, but wondered what they thought about him. Crockta touched his chin.\u00a0</span><span>It felt like a test, just like the fights they encountered as they passed through the Black Forest.\u00a0</span><span>If so, was this man the hermit of the Black Forest and was this the ultimate test?</span></p><br/><p><span>The first one to answer was Anor.\u00a0</span><span>\"It is too much. Even if your child is sick... what if your child wants to live for longer? Wanting to kill...maybe talk to your child...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA child wouldn\u2019t understand what the \u2018promised death\u2019 is. Wouldn\u2019t it be wrong to cause him pain just because of the future?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What about the child? Even if it is painful, the child could want to live more...</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A child wouldn\u2019t understand it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How terrible the pain is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is that the end of your answer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor wasn\u2019t able to say anything more and closed his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo replied next, \"You are foolish in your dream </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anyway, life is about being alone! If there is the promised death, that is your son\u2019s share. You don\u2019t need to kill him. Besides, killing the child is simply futilely meddling in his fate!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm, is it like that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You don\u2019t understand the dream.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you saying </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"My son fell in the water. If the child drowns, will you let that be the child\u2019s share?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is a different story </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is the same story.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo moaned and shook his head. The man started mumbling to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now it was Crockta\u2019s turn.\u00a0</span><span>The hermit of the Black Forest looked at Crockta. He seemed to be waiting for the next answer. Crockta thought carefully.</span></p><br/><p><span>The promised death.\u00a0</span><span>Somehow, it was a familiar notion.\u00a0</span><span>It was similar to what he heard from the desperate demon sleeping at his waist and the orc\u2019s story about the nameless god. The dream that the man was talking about felt like a dream.</span></p><br/><p><span>Those who were desperate always had the same reason.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was scary.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta spoke up.\u00a0</span><span>The hermit of the Black Forest shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No, the child didn\u2019t understand it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Not the child.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at the hermit of the Black Forest. It was an emotionless face where no feelings could be found. Like a doll. Within the dark eyes that didn\u2019t show any contrast, was there a human mind that he could sympathize with?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You were scared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, the hermit\u2019s face seemed to shake.\u00a0</span><span>But then his face became still again.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta continued speaking, \"In a world where you can\u2019t understand the promised death, you were struggling with fear when you discovered your child\u2019s ending.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You trembled with fear as you understood the true reality, and spent many nights before making the tragic decision for your child.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>\"Just you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a soldier fighting on the front lines. Therefore, he often went to a counselor to have his mental state checked. In the process, it was easy to know their consultation strategy.\u00a0</span><span>There was the first step that the counselor had to take when dealing with clients.\u00a0</span><span>It was to build up rapport!\u00a0</span><span>The building of mutual trust through empathy!</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta said with tearful eyes, \"You must\u2019ve been very lonely. Really...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Crockta squinted at the hermit\u2019s expression.\u00a0</span><span>The hermit of the Black Forest\u2019s face didn\u2019t change.</span></p><br/><p><span>Damn, it was a failure.\u00a0</span><span>The moment that Crockta was about to modify his strategy,</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Churuk!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>A tear flowed from the hermit\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The expression still looked like ice but tears were flowing down from both eyes. He realized the change and stuttered.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He caught a teardrop with his fingertips and stared at it.\u00a0</span><span>He was still expressionless, but he somehow gave off a lonely feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span>His eyes turned to Crockta again.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta felt like an intense scorer who broke past the goalkeeper and finished the game smoothly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I also can\u2019t understand the promised death. But I can see that you had to make a really lonely and painful decision in your dream. I am really sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he stared up at the sky. It was great directing.</span></p><br/><p><span>The hermit stared at Crockta\u2019s face. Then he opened his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>\"Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He waved his hand over his face and it became clean. It was magic.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It would have been really painful and lonely.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The corners of the hermit\u2019s mouth slowly went up.\u00a0</span><span>It was a beautiful smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m glad to know you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He clapped and the landscape changed.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s party was petrified.\u00a0</span><span>The scenery in front of them was no longer the forest.\u00a0</span><span>It was a huge castle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy name is Gushantimur.

I wandered to the northernmost part of the continent and saw the most beautiful lands,\u201d Caburak said.</span></p><br/><p><span> They walked from the hot spring towards the Holy Land of the orcs hidden deep in the forest.\u00a0</span><span>The ecology of the forest gradually changed. There were strange plants that he saw for the first time. The green forest gradually became white, silver and a mixture of other colors.\u00a0</span><span>Flowers and plants with a strange beauty that couldn\u2019t be seen anywhere else stood in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Wasn\u2019t the land of the dark elves in the north?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"At that time, such limits didn\u2019t apply to me. Kyulkyulkyul.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Caburak laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span> \"Did you change your appearance?\u201d Crockta asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyulkyul, something like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was said that changing his appearance and deceiving others was very difficult magic. Crockta nodded. Caburak was certainly a mighty shaman.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I found an ominous presence in that place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak recalled his memories. It was the presence of a demon. It had been sleeping a long time to regain its strength, and its power was so strong that the fallen beings of that land were raising themselves into undead.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I asked for support from the dark elves but...they didn\u2019t believe me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Um...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The demon was soon about to wake up. I had no choice but to get rid of it alone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a great demon who called himself the demon king. He still hadn\u2019t recovered his strength but his undead army made him the worst to face alone.\u00a0</span><span>If left alone, he would be resurrected and not just the dark elves, but the orcs and most of the north would be devastated.</span></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s why Caburak faced him alone.\u00a0</span><span>He used the treasure of his family, the artifact called \u2018Constellation Staff\u2019, but it was destroyed during the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak was determined to die to stop it.\u00a0</span><span>He fought using everything he had.\u00a0</span><span>Thus, after using all his powers, he succeeded in killing the demon. \u00a0</span><span>The price was his magic power, the Constellation Staff and...</span></p><br/><p><span>His life force.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I won\u2019t be able to live for a long time...kyulkyulkyul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak laughed like it didn\u2019t mean anything.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Since I lost my strength and couldn\u2019t freely move around the north like before...I tried to return to Orcheim. I had just barely reached the territory of the orcs when I was captured by the Great Clan and sold as a slave. Then we met, Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His eyes were telling the truth.\u00a0</span><span>Caburak omitted a lot of the story, but Crockta knew of his hard work. Caburak, the orc shaman who sacrificed his life to save the world.\u00a0</span><span>But his story wouldn\u2019t be remembered by anyone in history. His noble sacrifice wasn\u2019t recorded anywhere.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now Caburak didn\u2019t look like a normal orc to Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta asked, \"How can you laugh?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We're here.\u201d Caburak</span><span>\u00a0pointed to the front instead of answering. Crockta turned his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a cave.\u00a0</span><span>An unknown, refreshing feeling was felt from it. It was the opposite of the demonic energy of the Forest of Creatures.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Something feels good </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyulkyulkyul, follow me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Upon entering the cave, Crockta felt a sense of deja vu.\u00a0</span><span>Yes, it looked similar.\u00a0</span><span>It resembled the path that he walked towards the Hall of Fame in Orcrox. The cave was artificially cut, like someone had touched the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span>They walked through the darkness. Caburak created a light at his fingertips to light up the way.\u00a0</span><span>They kept walking.\u00a0</span><span>Finally, there was a large space at the end of the cave.</span></p><br/><p><span>A monument stood there.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the same as the monument that had the warrior\u2019s laws carved on it. There was writing in the ancient orc language that he couldn\u2019t understand.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is a unique object from our god,\u201d said Caburak. </span><span>\"We don't believe in the gods. The Goddess of Benevolence, God of Light, God of War, etc. They aren\u2019t gods, they are just stronger than we are.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo nodded. Gnomes traditionally didn\u2019t have a religion. They were usually atheists.</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak laughed. The sound of his low laugh rang through the space. He raised the light to reveal the words written on the monument.\u00a0</span><span>They were different from the warrior\u2019s laws.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta,\u201d Caburak called out.\u00a0</span>His eyes were clear. It was no longer Caburak\u2019s voice.</p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe world is like dust that runs into the void.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>He heard a similar story somewhere before.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you look at the universe, the world is empty and all living things will eventually sink into the void.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Some people believe in heaven after death, but it is inevitable that they will sink downwards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the story told by the demon when Crockta obtained the Demon\u2019s Belt. Crockta touched the belt. It didn\u2019t respond.\u00a0</span><span>Caburak was talking about the same nothingness, but his voice was somewhat gentler.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"In this tiny world, is your Bul\u2019tar meaningful?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I killed the demon and saved the world. That was my honor. But Crockta, in a world that will sink anyway, is our clamoring meaningful? Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak was still laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta couldn\u2019t answer.\u00a0</span><span>If he hadn\u2019t obtained the Despairing Demon\u2019s Mouth, he might not have considered his answer.\u00a0</span><span>But he had been infused with the idea of the voice by the Demon\u2019s Mouth.\u00a0</span><span>He witnessed it, making this question too difficult.\u00a0</span><span>In the end, everything would die.</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak kept laughing as he looked at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\"What do you think, Crockta?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at Caburak. The face of this broken orc seemed to already have its own answer.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta replied, \"It doesn't really matter.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No matter what meaning it has, I will do what I believe. I\u2019ll just do what I have to. Even if it doesn\u2019t make sense, I will walk along my own path.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEven if no one acknowledges you? What if no one understands, or if the world is against your beliefs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It will be the same.\"\u00a0</span><span>Crockta also laughed as he looked at Caburak.\u00a0</span><span>\"If the road is solitary, I will be a little lonely. But that is it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak\u2019s expression changed.\u00a0</span><span>His eyes grew larger and he started to laugh out loud.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Only loneliness...you really are an orc. Crockta.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Then he pointed to the monument.\u00a0</span><span>\"His voice came and he looked at us. He promised us only one thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak cried out loudly, his voice echoing throughout the cave.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We will look so that you aren\u2019t lonely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He also heard this somewhere before.\u00a0</span><span>A familiar face popped into his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018God, please acknowledge me. See that our honor won\u2019t be lonely.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox had said this before passing on the warrior\u2019s laws.</span></p><br/><p><span>Caburak's voice continued, \"He who we don\u2019t understand or can\u2019t understand. He who builds the world and supports the world. And he who always watch us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo listened. Caburak\u2019s voice sounded like a spell in their heads.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He who blows the wind along our back when we walk the road alone.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Caburak\u2019s eyes turned towards the monument.\u00a0</span><span>\"This is our god... no, our pathetic belief.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI sacrificed my life to save the world. But nobody knows. If this was meaningless, how lonely would I be?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Caburak hit Crockta\u2019s shoulders.\u00a0</span><span>\"So I desperately hoped. Someone is watching. That is why we walk through life with a sense of honor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is the case.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We believe in the forgotten god of the orcs, the nameless god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Silence filled the space.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo spoke like he wanted to break the atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We are the same dot. We gnomes are atheists. One gnome said that if there is something they can\u2019t understand, it isn\u2019t worthy of their faith. If they couldn\u2019t understand, there is no reason to believe in it. But we gnomes sometimes pray for salvation. Orcs are like gnomes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then Tiyo, you also believe in our nameless god. You can shout Bul\u2019tar nicely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBah, people who preach are disgusting dot!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Gnomes too. Kyulkyulkyul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They left the Holy Land.\u00a0</span><span>It was called a Holy Land, but it was just a cave and monument.</span></p><br/><p><span>He asked Caburak, \"Well, the reason why... it is the only relic left by our god, so we call it the Holy Land.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked up at the sky.\u00a0</span><span>There was no difference from the sky in reality.\u00a0</span><span>If he kept on playing Elder Lord, he would forget that this is a game. Once he heard about the orc\u2019s beliefs, he felt like this world was more realistic.</span></p><br/><p><span>Looking at the smiling Caburak and straight-backed Tiyo, he could hardly think of them as meaningless existences.\u00a0</span><span>The nameless god.</span></p><br/><p><span>As Caburak said, he was watching over them.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was locked in his thoughts.\u00a0</span><span>And at that moment, an arrow flew out from among the bushes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAgain?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo rolled his body and cried out like he was tired. Caburak ran towards the place where the arrow had fallen, while Crockta lowered his position and grabbed his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t an arrow from a dark elf.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then who</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is from a gnome\u2019s crossbow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo\u2019s eyes widened. Arrows flew again. Crockta\u2019s group flung themselves down.\u00a0</span><span>Then a voice was heard, \"This is the Holy Land of the orcs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>An alluring female voice.\u00a0</span><span>\"We can get rid of all of them. Kill them all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked for the source of the voice and saw a gap in the bushes.\u00a0</span><span>A female gnome wearing armor was commanding the unit. She was small but she looked like a beautiful woman. </span><span>The gnomes followed her order and advanced quickly. They were all carrying crossbows.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Gnomes...</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo\u2019s expression changed. He immediately seized General on his back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTiyo?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta called out to him but Tiyo got up from the ground and fired General towards the front.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The ones who have forgotten the honor of the gnomes, die</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Colorful flashes hit the gnomes. There was a rain of magic bullets and due to the small size of the species, the gnomes couldn\u2019t endure the hit and collapsed.\u00a0</span><span>Other gnomes tried to aim their crossbows but Tiyo moved quickly and disturbed them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta plunged in with his greatsword whenever there was a gap.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Be careful!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta blocked the crossbow arrows with his greatsword. The gnomes shouted and tried to reload the arrows. However, giving such a moment to an orc warrior was a precursor to a slaughter.\u00a0</span><span>A few gnomes held up shields and spears to stop Crockta. But it was clearly the difference between David and Goliath.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is a gnome with an artifact.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnome commander gritted her teeth. </span><span>She shouted in Tiyo\u2019s direction, \u201cYou are a gnome! A gnome joining forces with those hostile to us, you should be ashamed!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStop talking nonsense </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo jumped up.\u00a0</span><span>Then Tiyo flinched and stopped as he was about to shout. He was at a loss after seeing the commander\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A tremendous beauty</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo muttered. The commander was embarrassed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...S-Shut up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo soon regained his spirit.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI-In any case! Gnomes who are linked with trafficking slaves are shameful </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Bah, how old-fashioned!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Their eyes flashed as they glared at each other.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment.\u00a0</span><span>The bush next to Tiyo started shaking.\u00a0</span><span>It was the enemy. A gnome soldier jumped out and aimed a spear at Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Tiyo!\u201d Crockta shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span>The spear was heading towards Tiyo\u2019s chest.\u00a0</span><span>It was only for a moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStupid child.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo skillfully dodged the attack and placed his arm around the enemy gnome\u2019s neck.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...K-Keok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo seemed hesitant, but he soon put strength in his arms.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Crunch.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The gnome\u2019s neck was broken and he fell down.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>An outstanding body!\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo truly was like Bruce Lee.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo let go of the dead and stared up at the sky.\u00a0</span><span>He never killed his own people.\u00a0</span><span>He was a gnome of the Quantes garrison. He protected gnomes and never imagined that he would kill another gnome.</span></p><br/><p><span>But the time had come for him to do so.\u00a0</span><span>He killed the gnome with his own hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>'We walk our lives with honor.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He remembered Caburak\u2019s words. Then Tiyo nodded.\u00a0</span><span>He would just believe as well.\u00a0</span><span>His path was right.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo turned his head. The gnomes flinched. In addition to the powerful artifact, they were afraid of his ability to kill a soldier in a flash.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo met Crockta\u2019s gaze.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta nodded. They were eyes that seemed to understand everything. Tiyo smiled at him.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a reliable colleague.\u00a0</span><span>If so, there was nothing to hold him back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let's go, Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo shouted as he rushed forward with General.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tarrrr!\u201d</span></p><br/><p>I'm going New Zealand tomorrow for 5 days.

However, he couldn\u2019t stop. He raised the limits of his power and entered the realm of the Pinnacle.</span></p><br/><p><span>But in a flash, he moved away from the Pinnacle as the world\u2019s speed returned to normal.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Dammit.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>His stamina was drained, as he had fought for too long. He couldn\u2019t reach the Pinnacle anymore.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta tried to use the power again. His body gradually accelerated. His mind overwhelmed his body. The world slowed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then his body twisted again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He turned around.\u00a0</span><span>An arrow was stuck in his calf.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t know when he had been hit.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Betring and the knights were rushing towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked around. He didn\u2019t have a weapon.\u00a0</span><span>He used his bare hands to fight the fully armed knights.</span></p><br/><p><span>A collision between the two occurred.\u00a0</span><span>It couldn\u2019t be helped, even if it was Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>He avoided the weapons, but their bodies slammed into him and he flew back.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta fell to the ground. He rolled across angular rocks so his whole body was bloody. He felt lightheaded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How many achievement points will I get from killing him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>A Heaven and Earth member was approaching.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta spat out blood and tried to raise his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEh?\u201d The clan member</span><span>\u00a0suddenly stared at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThis guy...his forehead...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta could feel something hot flowing down from his forehead.\u00a0</span><span>Blood. There was a wound on his forehead.\u00a0</span><span>He felt his forehead. The red headband around it was half torn.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPerhaps...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stood up and swung his fist. The user\u2019s head exploded and he turned into white particles.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Keuk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He felt back down again from the recoil.\u00a0</span><span>Arrows pierced his calf and shoulder, the fire that burned his body and the wounds from the knights\u2019 weapons meant his body didn\u2019t function properly.\u00a0</span><span>As Crockta staggered, the knights\u2019 attacks flew towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta collapsed and the kicking continued.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If we capture this guy alive...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHis Majesty...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Make an example of him...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Their voices were heard above his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Wait a minute. Sir knights, please wait.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Heaven and Earth members were approaching.\u00a0</span><span>One of them reached out towards Crockta\u2019s forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWait...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta blocked the hand and the kicks came flying again. Crockta fell down without any strength left.\u00a0</span><span>The moment they were about to completely rip off Crockta\u2019s headband...</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Peeok.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Blood poured onto Crockta\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta frowned and opened his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>The user\u2019s head was gone. Blood was flowing down from the neck.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kuaaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The roar of a beast.\u00a0</span><span>It was somehow familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The low-frequency cry of a beast was heard.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta turned around. He fell to his knees. He gripped his weary head. The blood had blurred his vision.\u00a0</span><span>Gradually, his head became clear.\u00a0</span><span>He breathed deeply as some strength was restored to his broken body.</span></p><br/><p><span>He slowly got up. Crockta tore a dead soldier\u2019s clothing and used it to cover his ripped headband.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPant, pant...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His hands were empty. A greatsword was needed. Crockta looked around for Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>Suddenly, Ogre Slayer was pushed to his side.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thank you...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Huge teeth were biting the blade of Ogre Slayer. Crockta unconsciously took it and looked at the one who gave it to him.\u00a0</span><span>The teeth were sharp enough to chew on an ogre\u2019s skin.\u00a0</span><span>The eyes of a fierce beast.\u00a0</span><span>The body covered in stripes was somehow familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSimba?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuang!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The first mission given by Lenox was the mutant wolf hunt.\u00a0</span><span>This was clearly the grown up tiger Simba, who had been unable to fight the mutant wolf and his pack. Simba shook his head like he was pleased to see Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why are you here...?\"\u00a0</span><span>Crockta raised his head.\u00a0</span><span>There was another familiar face.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You have become stronger, grrung!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The orc he met at Lenox\u2019s funeral, \u2018Mountain Smasher\u2019 Kumarak who possessed a tremendous strength.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThere is no time. We have to get out! Grrung!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kumarak grabbed Crockta and dragged him.\u00a0</span><span>The knights tried to stop them, but couldn\u2019t approach due to Simba. They started running.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you doing? Follow!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Betring shouted. The knights got on their horses again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuaaaaang!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Simba roared.\u00a0</span><span>The horses freaked out at Simba\u2019s roar. The knights struggled with the horses.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Betring ran directly. The soldiers followed.\u00a0</span><span>Simba turned and ran towards Crockta and Kumarak.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Surround them!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The city was fully occupied.\u00a0</span><span>Soldiers appeared from many directions to block their path. Simba ran towards them, but the enemies resisted.\u00a0</span><span>Kumarak raised his axe.\u00a0</span><span>Then colorful flashes of light flew at the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRun! Quickly </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Tiyo. He was riding on a bone wyvern with Anor.\u00a0</span><span>A small number of people had come to save Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Due to Tiyo\u2019s shooting, the enemies fell and Crockta and Kumark escaped the encirclement.</span></p><br/><p><span>The various minor enemies were dealt with by Simba. Every time the huge paws hit an enemy, the body was ripped to pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is no time </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Run away quickly!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo shouted from above them.\u00a0</span><span>\"The condition of the bones isn\u2019t good </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Run!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The bone wyvern they were controlling now wasn\u2019t like Boro in the north. It was small and couldn\u2019t carry many people.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Eeit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo changed General to a more advanced Vulcan mode and furiously fired.\u00a0</span><span>The knights used their swords and shields to block it. Some bullets bounced off the armor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Persistent </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The soldiers kept on increasing.\u00a0</span><span>Rommel showed up in the rear. Under his command, the soldiers forgot their fear and pursued Crockta and Kumarak.\u00a0</span><span>After calming their horses, the knights attempted an encirclement.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAt this rate...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kumarak tightened his grip on his axe.\u00a0</span><span>Maybe they should fight.\u00a0</span><span>He glanced at Crockta. Kumarak read the answer in Crockta\u2019s eyes and nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kumarak laughed.\u00a0</span><span>The previously immature orc was now a warrior shaking the continent.\u00a0</span><span>He fought like a warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>They stopped at the same time.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta held Ogre Slayer. Kumarak waved his battle axe.\u00a0</span><span>Expressions that indicated they would fight.\u00a0</span><span>Pressure spread out from Crockta and Kumarak.\u00a0</span><span>The troops chasing them flinched. They were chasing but once their targets stopped, they couldn\u2019t attack.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In addition, the gnome was pointing a strange weapon at them from above.\u00a0</span><span>As they were stunned, Rommel came forward. Despite this turmoil, he was able to maintain a sober expression.\u00a0</span><span>He scanned Crockta and Kumarak. Then he looked at Tiyo and Anor on the wyvern.\u00a0</span><span>It looked as though he was searching all of them.\u00a0</span><span>Then he opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEverybody...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The soldiers raised their weapons. His order was conveyed, despite him not saying anything else.\u00a0</span><span>The atmosphere reversed.\u00a0</span><span>Their morale changed whenever Rommel was on the front lines.\u00a0</span><span>After Crockta and Kumarak\u2019s atmosphere changed, the soldiers lowered their posture and stared with resolute eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>The air felt like it was about to explode.\u00a0</span><span>The fight was about to start again.\u00a0</span><span>All of a sudden, screams were heard from the soldiers in the rear.</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel looked around.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He shook his reins from confusion.\u00a0</span><span>The militia members were approaching them.\u00a0</span><span>They were all dead.\u00a0</span><span>Just corpses.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNecromancer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They walked with their broken bodies.\u00a0</span><span>The bizarre sight terrified the soldiers. It was an instinctive fear towards death. It wasn\u2019t just the north that had a taboo against dealing with death.</span></p><br/><p><span>A </span><i><span>kiik </span></i><span>noise was heard.\u00a0</span><span>Rommel looked back at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>The flying wyvern landed on the ground. It couldn\u2019t maintain its body anymore.\u00a0</span><span>The gnome and dark elf jumped down while concentrating.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA necromancer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta, Kumarak. Two monsters.\u00a0</span><span>There was the gnome with the good artifact and the necromancer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGrrrung...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A huge tiger that was staring at them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Rommel had wondered about the orc who had an unfortunate relationship with Keynes.\u00a0</span><span>This battle was already beyond his expectations.\u00a0</span><span>It was the first time the battle hadn\u2019t flowed according to his will since he received the War Maestro class. His predictions and plans had fallen through.</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, he declared.\u00a0</span><span>\"Withdraw.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was no need to fight anymore.\u00a0</span><span>Anyway, they would meet again.\u00a0</span><span>The empire\u2019s army followed him in an orderly manner. It was a systematic movement that seemed impossible for the soldiers who were tired from the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel once again glanced at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes were clearly visible.\u00a0</span><span>Then Rommel turned his horse around. He left in a leisurely manner.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta sighed at the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, you would be dead if it wasn\u2019t for us </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. Kahahat.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo laughed cheerfully as he spoke to Crockta. Crockta grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was after the battle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThanks to you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo hit Crockta\u2019s ass. Then he panicked as blood emerged.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cCrockta! You aren\u2019t okay </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! There is a wound on your rear!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His recovery was better than a troll\u2019s, but there were many wounds on his large body.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo hit his back. Crockta groaned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis place! Many injuries </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! You\u2019re not okay!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Tak tak!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\"It hurts!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You won\u2019t die </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo laughed again.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>As he walked beside his party, Crockta looked up at the sky.\u00a0</span><span>The crows hadn\u2019t left yet and were circling above him.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>They arrived at Katalu, the center of Espada.\u00a0</span><span>Espada was originally a place with a strong local color, and it didn\u2019t appreciate any interference from the kingdom. They paid taxes but rejected being ruled.\u00a0</span><span>Their pride was strong and they wouldn\u2019t acknowledge the empire.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is Katalu </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta frowned at the distant view of Katalu.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo scratched his head at Crockta\u2019s expression.\u00a0</span><span>They all felt it.\u00a0</span><span>Katalu was too open.\u00a0</span><span>Katalu had no outer walls. It might be easy to open, but it made Katalu vulnerable to invasions.\u00a0</span><span>Right now, they were setting up barricades and obstacles in preparation for a siege. However, it was a poor place to fight.</span></p><br/><p><span>This would be an easy defeat for the elite knights of the empire.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let\u2019s go inside and see </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t look like that. Crockta is a wounded person so you can\u2019t get stressed.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor supported Crockta. Crockta nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>Simba licked his cheek.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Simba. It has been a while. You have grown bigger.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He had earned the title \u2018One who Respects the Honour of Tigers\u2019 by building a friendship with Simba. It felt like he could feel Simba\u2019s pleasure.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"At that time, you were still young.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta thought Simba was big at the time, but a great bloodline ran through his veins. Even if Crockta wasn\u2019t there, Simba would\u2019ve been able to destroy the mutant wolves after some time passed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This guy came to give something to you. Grrung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Give me what?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will show you soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He tapped the sack around Simba\u2019s neck. Crockta was confused.</span></p><br/><p><span>They arrived at Katalu.\u00a0</span><span>The residents of Katalu welcomed Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you Crockta! We are acquainted with your reputation. Tiyo and Anor were also very helpful to us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Katula\u2019s mayor and the leader of the resistance, Guardi shook hands with Crockta. The residents cheered for Crockta, who fought against the empire.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Jiing.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>His vision blurred.\u00a0</span><span>The world became black and white.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked around.\u00a0</span><span>His spirit escaped from his body. He was looking at his body. He watched himself shake hands with Guardi, with the cheering residents, Kumarak and his companions around him.\u00a0</span><span>His spirit kept rising.\u00a0</span><span>It was like he had been released.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked down on everything.\u00a0</span><span>He continued to rise upwards until everything became smaller.\u00a0</span><span>Now he was able to see all of Katalu.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018.......!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he felt sick with fear.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHmm?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta regained his mind.\u00a0</span><span>Guardi was looking at him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>What did he just see?\u00a0</span><span>Crockta touched his head.

Everything they built had turned into ash. Edelweiss supported the other villages, but there was a limit to the amount of food and supplies that could be shared.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then a merchant company appeared, as if they had been waiting for the war to finish. They entered the ruined Chesswood with daily necessities, food, and building supplies. A memorandum was given to those who couldn\u2019t pay the price.</span></p><br/><p><span>All of them signed it. The residents who almost lost their lives had no qualms about risking their lives for their future.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta frowned as he asked, \u201cDerek?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy replied.</span></p><br/><p><span>Derek was involved in the rebuilding process of the collapsed Chesswood and spread out his influence as a result.\u00a0</span><span>Now most of the residents of Chesswood were debtors who owed him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta didn\u2019t ask anything more. He didn\u2019t like Derek\u2019s behavior, but there was nothing he could do. Beyond the good in the world, there was also selfishness and malice. If he had to choose, then he would prefer the former over the latter.</span></p><br/><p><span>Derek bought the equipment from the dead users for more than their value.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see, this is how Derek works.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes. He does whatever he wants.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After the situation was settled, Crockta looked for the users who helped Chesswood.\u00a0</span><span>They didn\u2019t explain about the video because they thought Crockta was a NPC. They just said that they heard rumors of an honorable orc and came to help. Crockta inwardly laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you for the help Iron.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. I just did what I had to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Iron and Crockta shook hands.\u00a0</span><span>Iron was very gentle when he wasn\u2019t acting like a crazy necromancer. His attitude as he shook hands had no error, and even the angle of his line of sight was perfect.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was the person who decimated a clan alone? Crockta felt admiration towards him.\u00a0</span><span>Iron sent him a mysterious smile and said, \u201cThis is my business card...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, I made a mistake.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He flinched due to his habit of automatically stretched out his hand.\u00a0</span><span>\"Please don't pay attention to it. Huhuhuhu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, yes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, people like us will develop a deeper flavor as time passes, just like wine ripens.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was great to meet you. You are a man that is like a bunch of burgundy grapes shining under the sun. I want to meet you again, just like opening the bottle of wine that I saved for the moment when it has the best flavor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...T-Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Iron ran his finger over his eyebrows and then pointed it at the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Adios Amigo!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, yes... Take care of yourself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Iron laughed and turned away. He never looked back, just waving his hand high in the sky as he left. It seemed like this situation had inspired something.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta wanted to see him off, but then he felt a gaze on his from behind.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That mister...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat necromancer would have no problem joining our team if he has such a concept.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA nice guy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Another group that helped Chesswood, F4, admired Iron.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta greeted them, \"Thanks to you, I was able to defend the village.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>At Crockta\u2019s words, the warrior Bob emerged to represent the group.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Honorable orc Crockta, do you see this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Bob held out his sword, the so-called X-Geiger. The sword was vibrating. As Crockta looked closer, Bob was lightly shaking the sword with fine wrist snaps.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"X-Geiger is crying out in response to your hot soul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>What was this?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour hot heart has protected this peaceful village from the invaders! It allowed X-Geiger to lead us here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, my X-Geiger is always thirsty. X-Geiger isn\u2019t thirsty for water, alcohol, nor the enemy\u2019s blood. My X-Geiger drinks...! Hup...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The elf Elia covered Bob\u2019s mouth. Bob and Elia struggled for a while.\u00a0</span><span>Instead of them, the bearded magician Joseph stepped forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am the great sage. Honorable orc Crockta, this great sage has something to say to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, Great Sage.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Keep the peace of Middle Earth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Middle Ea...rth?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You have to destroy the ring...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta gave up thinking.\u00a0</span><span>Then it was Gary\u2019s turn. The man with dark eyebrows hit Crockta\u2019s shoulder. It was an intense gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBe well. We will be enemies when we meet again next time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he dramatically turned around.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Why would they be enemies, what...?\u00a0</span><span>Crockta couldn\u2019t understand, but they seemed like people who really enjoyed Elder Lord. He bowed to express his appreciation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Aren\u2019t they crazy over there...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Orc Users Brotherhood shook their heads as they watched the scene. No matter how realistic the game was, there were some people who got too caught up in the concept.\u00a0</span><span>After speaking to F4, Crockta stood in front of the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Their eyes met.\u00a0</span><span>It was enough.\u00a0</span><span>The passionate eye contact between orcs!</span></p><br/><p><span>Someone hit their thick chest and yelled, \u201cBul\u2019tar\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500! I\u2019m alive! Brother!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500! Stay alive, Brothers!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They grabbed each other\u2019s hands and slammed their shoulders against each other. Crockta also grabbed the hand of one of the orc brothers. It was close to a battle of strength.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt was an honorable fight\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No one can stop the way of the orcs!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cVictory and glory! If I can\u2019t live then I would rather die\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar! An honorable death rather than a subservient life!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs shouted together.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Waaahhhhhhhh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Bul\u2019tarrrr!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuaaaah!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Soon everyone was standing shoulder to shoulder. </span><span>Crockta started to sing, \u201cWe are orcs! The mighty orcs!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>All the orcs sang along.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou\u2019ll be in trouble if you mess with us! The great warriors have appeared!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHumans, get lost! Elves, get lost! Dwarves, get lost! You guys too!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPretty women? Warriors have no need for a woman! We are great orcs, great warriors!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe are orcs! The mighty orcs!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou\u2019ll be in trouble if you mess with us!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The harsh harmonies shook the earth!\u00a0</span><span>The F4 group shook their heads as they watched the exciting festival of the orc users.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We still have manners.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey sold their soul to the concept.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is \u2018real\u2019...\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta said farewell to the users and climbed Edelweiss\u2019 hill with Jeremy.\u00a0</span><span>The tall hill looked over the villages of Chesswood spread out in a checkered pattern.</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore was buried here.\u00a0</span><span>It was a short relationship. They had only walked together for a while, but it was enough time to feel his inner nature. He was a good man.\u00a0</span><span>On his grave, Crockta set down the musical instrument that Blackmore always carried around with him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta declared, \"Jeremy.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Where do people go if they die?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy shrugged.\u00a0</span><span>\"Well, I don't know. Won\u2019t he go to Heaven because he died for others?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHeaven...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore had gone to Heaven. Would it be Heaven if he was scattered around Elder Lord\u2019s servers as packets of data?</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at Jeremy. His face was tinged with the glow of the sun. Jeremy was a man who always grunted and spoke a lot. However, his eyes were currently red. Was it because of the glow or not?</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy started to whistle.\u00a0</span><span>It was Blackmore\u2019s song.\u00a0</span><span>The melody of the minstrel who longed for his hometown covered the hill as Jeremy whistled.\u00a0</span><span>Was someone whispering the words along with the whistle? Was Jeremy, hiding his wet eyes, just an electronic signal calculated by a computer?\u00a0</span><span>Was his grief just converted game data?</span></p><br/><p><span>'If all these deaths are truly sad, go to the Temple of the Fallen God.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The man's voice popped into his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta walked towards a large rock on a corner of the hill. He used Ogre Slayer on it, slicing the enormous rock into the shape of a cross.\u00a0</span><span>He moved it and set it down on Blackmore\u2019s grave.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crocka carved an epitaph for Blackmore using the tip of the sword.\u00a0</span><span>He was dead, so this was the only thing Crockta could do.</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy spoke from behind Crockta, \"Crockta.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>He had always called Crockta \u2018Orc brother\u2019. It was strange hearing Jeremy\u2019s voice call his name. Crockta looked at Jeremy.\u00a0</span><span>\"Boss sent me some information about those bastards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Brother, whatever you do, I would like to go with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy's eyes were serious.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What, why are you laughing? Don\u2019t get me wrong, I just don\u2019t like those guys.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t say anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Your eyes look awful,\u201d Jeremy grumbled.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta completed the gravestone. Jeremy approached and touched the words.\u00a0</span><span>\"I'll go to hell anyway, so I will never meet you again.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>A minstrel who matched Heaven, Blackmore.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGoodbye, Minstrel Brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Jeremy left Blackmore\u2019s grave.\u00a0</span><span>It was another farewell.\u00a0</span><span>As the wind blew, the sound of Blackmore\u2019s instrument rang through the hills. The clear sound was heard.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Jeremy waved their hands in response.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Derek signed the paper.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Good work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ever since Jeremy left, Derek had another subordinate doing his role.\u00a0</span><span>Derek leaned his elbow on the office table and touched his chin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What did Jeremy reply?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe will watch the orc a little more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Derek laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn't believe it. Jeremy was probably excited by Crockta, and wanted to go together with him more. Jeremy was such a person. He pretended to be cold-blooded and rough, but he couldn\u2019t easily shake it off once he felt affection for someone.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...Boss, will this really result in some money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf you open up your mind, then you will see the path.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How do you know to invest in this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf you are talking about the reconstruction project, of course I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s why I will recollect it later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Derek grabbed a piece of paper and started writing a letter.\u00a0</span><span>The recipient was Jeremy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Investment doesn\u2019t necessarily mean monetary gain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeep this in mind. Preparing for future risks can also be called an investment from a broad perspective.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Derek continued to move his pen. The length of the letter got longer.\u00a0</span><span>\"In order to figure out the profits, I need to know the anxiety factors.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnxiety factors...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Derek raised the letter instead of answering.\u00a0</span><span>He placed it in an envelope and sealed it with candle wax. He extended it to the man.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you understand that I know who will betray me later?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Take care of it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man nodded.\u00a0</span><span>Derek\u2019s expression indicated that there should be no more questions asked. The subordinate immediately retreated and left Derek\u2019s office.\u00a0</span><span>The door closed and Derek buried himself in his chair.</span></p><br/><p><span>He recalled Jeremy\u2019s face. He had been a boy living in the rough back alleys that grew up into a fine, young man. Jeremy grew so well that he was about to break the line that Derek had hung around his neck.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"One day it would come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Derek smiled. The feast had to end one day. Once the feast was over, the table would be cleaned up.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule: \u00a0<strong>Another Patreon goal has been reached!!

Did you rent this road? How much did you pay to rent it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Derek\u2019s subordinate, Jeremy.\u00a0</span><span>He had caught up as Crockta left Arnin, and headed northeast to Chesswood.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood, renting is comfortable. Renter, renter, renter, renter...ick.\u201d Jeremy</span><span>\u00a0smiled at Crockta\u2019s fierce glare.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou are scary. Relax, Brother\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta decided to ignore him. He started moving again.</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy whistled from behind him.\u00a0</span><span>Jeremy\u2019s whistling was very clear and high. At first, Crockta thought it was a flute sound. There was a time when he admired it, but now that whistling didn\u2019t sound very pleasant.</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy\u2019s whistle rang throughout the plains.</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, they continued their awkward companionship.</span></p><br/><p><span>As the name suggested, the Chesswood area that they were heading to had small human villages scattered about in a checkered pattern. Chesswood wasn\u2019t a big city like Arnin was, but a cluster of various small villages gathered together with their own system.</span></p><br/><p><span>What was the Thawing Balhae Clan doing there? Would he be able to find Grom\u2019s new character, the traitor called Hyunchul, and get revenge?</span></p><br/><p><span>The future was unknown, so he had to do the best that he could right now. Crockta decided to just go there for now.</span></p><br/><p><span>As they headed further east from Arnin, the forest disappeared, and an oft-traveled trail could be seen. If he proceeded to the center of the continent in this direction, he would be able to reach the big cities of the other species.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey, Orc brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...I am called Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh. Are we already friendly enough to call each other by name? Is this Day 1 of our relationship?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta wanted to kill him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you going to do with the cursed people in Chesswood? Are you going to use the Concrete method?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere is no need to know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No, I\u2019m Derek\u2019s delegate, so I should know if you\u2019re planning to do something strange. Our investment might fly away, after all. I need to know since our money is on the line.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Where did Derek invest in Chesswood?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSecret, a secret.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At the end of his words, Jeremy was standing beside Crockta. Crockta glanced at him but didn\u2019t point it out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t that a good sword? Is it expensive?\u201d Jeremy asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s the work of the Golden Anvil clan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hyu, how great. I\u2019m envious. I also want to buy a new sword.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As they talked, the two people started walking together.</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy started to whistle again.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta didn\u2019t know where it came from, but there was a melody to it. It wasn\u2019t too bad to walk leisurely while listening to Jeremy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are good.\u201d He said.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"When I was a child, I was proud of both my whistling and my sword skills.\u201d Jeremy</span><span>\u00a0started whistling again. The sound was crisp, and sounded good overall.\u00a0</span><span>\"Orc brother, do you know any songs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSongs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t think that a whistle can come out well from an orc\u2019s lips, so how about a song? Your voice is pretty good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA song.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was the orc song that he had learned from a pub in Orcrox. Maybe he should try it once. Crockta coughed. Jeremy looked at him with expectant eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hmm hmm.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He cleared his throat. It was slightly embarrassing singing this alone.\u00a0</span><span>However, he couldn\u2019t betray Jeremy\u2019s expectations, so he started awkwardly singing the warrior\u2019s song.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe are orcs! The mighty orcs! You\u2019ll be in trouble if you mess with us! The great warriors have appeared. Humans, get lost! Elves...get lost! Dwarves, get lost...! Gnomes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was an exciting song when sung in a group, but it was shameful to shout it out alone. The contents of \u2018Gnomes, get lost\u2019 followed by \u2018warriors don\u2019t need a woman\u2019 didn\u2019t fall from his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy looked taken aback.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy flashed an awkward and nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cG-Great.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>It was humiliating.\u00a0</span><span>It would\u2019ve been okay if Jeremy had teased him. But even Jeremy wasn\u2019t able to make fun of him!\u00a0</span><span>He even pretended and gave Crockta a compliment!</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta became anxious and dropped his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was impossible for humans to understand the wonderful song of orc warriors. He tried to maintain the spirit of victory. But he was a warrior who could face reality, so he couldn\u2019t turn away from his conscious and pride.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t every culture different? Ha, haha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta felt more shame at Jeremy\u2019s nice remark.\u00a0</span><span>Therefore, Crockta cleared his throat again.\u00a0</span><span>He wanted to let this guy know what a real song was.</span></p><br/><p><span>He said, \"That was just a joke.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No. The song was good, Brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will let you hear what a real song is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is no need...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grabbed Jeremy\u2019s shoulder. He flinched.\u00a0</span><span>\"Jeremy.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Have you ever been in love?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"L...Love?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, love.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What...I did have a love relationship...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen listen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was very serious.\u00a0</span><span>He closed his eyes and remembered the sound.\u00a0</span><span>Right now he had the low bass tones of an orc that most singers couldn\u2019t mimic.</span></p><br/><p><span>He recalled his school days. That boy\u2019s genuineness as he wept still breathed in his chest.\u00a0</span><span>He poured out the distant memories into the lyrics.\u00a0</span><span>This song would suffice.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s voice poured out like a sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Just like I wasn\u2019t prepared for the rain, I sent you away with silence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy\u2019s eyes widened. Crockta\u2019s voice, which was strangely low, sank calmly.\u00a0</span><span>The lyrics he sang were beautiful and melancholy, just like a poem.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"For a while, I would get drunk or sleep at dawn, trying to forget you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I can\u2019t forget that time, I realized something while thinking...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s low voice rang out. The bass tone was filled with heartbreaking emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A good person, if I had cherished you then, I wouldn\u2019t have been so sad when we broke up...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Suddenly, an old relationship passed through his mind.</span></p><br/><p><span>Jane. Her name was unforgettable, Jane. Both of them were in love, but she was the daughter of a well known family, and Jeremy was just a swordsman from the back streets. It was a relationship that wasn\u2019t possible. A painful love. She eventually left him, but Jeremy couldn\u2019t blame her.</span></p><br/><p><span>She...was a good person...\u00a0</span><span>Jeremy's eyes became wet.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now Crockta\u2019s song was reaching the climax. The end of the heartbreaking love song rang out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI would like to say that I will always protect you, please come back again...I\u2019ll make amends...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His song was over.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta closed his eyes and become drunk on his emotions for a while. Just like there was black soul in reality, Elder Lord had the orcs. It was a vocal structure that seemed born for this type of song.</span></p><br/><p><span>A stunning performance.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Clap.</span></i><i><span>Clap.</span></i><i><span>Clap.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>He opened his eyes at the sound of applause. It was from Jeremy.\u00a0</span><span>However, he wasn\u2019t the only one applauding. Crockta and Jeremy turned their heads at the same time.\u00a0</span><span>There was a strange man wiping his watery eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I heard it very well. It was a song that really made me feel like my heart was breaking.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man was carrying a musical instrument resembling a guitar.\u00a0</span><span>\"I am the minstrel Blackmore. I was heading this way when I heard a heartfelt voice by chance. It was a really great song.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am embarrassed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t be, Brother. It really was amazing. Your were hiding your singing skills.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Jeremy also acknowledged Crockta\u2019s song.</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore asked, \"Did you create that song?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, I just imitated the song of another singer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see... But the impression you have given me hasn\u2019t faded. What is your name?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am called Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Based on your direction, are you perhaps heading to Chesswood?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am also heading there. Do you mind if I accompany you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Feel free to do so.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Jeremy were joined by Blackmore. A light conversation was started after that as Blackmore asked, </span><span>\"The lyrics to that song are especially beautiful. What is the title of the song?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"As the lyrics said, it\u2019s called \u2018Good Person\u2019.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood Person... How great. If you love a good person, you won\u2019t be sad if you break up...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore nodded and wrote something in his notebook.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cOf course... That doesn\u2019t mean that you weren\u2019t really sad...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRight...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuoh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Paradoxical lyrics that a man could understand!\u00a0</span><span>The eyes of the three men became distant. They were gazing at old memories.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I had those days as well... Orc, why are you going to Chesswood? Are you going to participate in the contest...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cContest?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, you don\u2019t know. A small contest for minstrels will be held in Chesswood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh, really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It isn\u2019t a big competition. It\u2019s a small contest between the Chesswood villages, but the pride of the villages is at stake. I know since I am from Chesswood. That\u2019s why I returned home after a long time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I would like to see you play.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHahaha. Please come and watch. I will be singing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The conversation continued as they walked along the road.\u00a0</span><span>They started to enjoy music while walking. Blackmore played his instrument while Jeremy whistled. Crockta hummed along with his bold voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>A jazz conversation with their own melodies!\u00a0</span><span>It was fun to enjoy the music without worrying.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Suddenly, a voice was heard. Crockta looked in the direction of the sound.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a group of humans.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta didn\u2019t miss the white star on the forehead of the woman riding in the lead.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"NPCs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t this a funny combination? Orc musician?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There were five people, all users.\u00a0</span><span>Jeremy was unconcerned but Blackmore welcomed them cheerfully. He greeted them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hello!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The woman who seemed to be leading the group laughed and replied.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYes, hello. Mister Minstrel!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>She was also friendly to NPCs. She seemed to be familiar with Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am the minstrel Blackmore, and these two are Crockta and Jeremy, who are accompanying me to Chesswood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Jeremy lightly bowed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oh my god, really? We are also going there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She turned around and talked briefly with her group. She seemed to be asking if they should join up.\u00a0</span><span>\"Then would you like to go with us? I would like to hear your music. Is everybody here a minstrel?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHahaha. I am the only minstrel, but they are musically talented.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWow, great.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore declared, \"Let\u2019s go together. Sharing music is a wonderful thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The party increased. There was now a group of eight people heading to Chesswood.</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore was returning to his home after a long time, so he started to sing song reminiscent of his hometown. It was a singing skill that was just as wonderful as his skill with the musical instrument. The users clapped in response.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Jeremy grabbed the hem of Crockta\u2019s clothes and pulled him close.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Brother, are they people cursed by the stars?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He asked in a low voice. He knew that Crockta was one of those cursed by the stars and that they could recognize each other.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta nodded.\u00a0</span><span>Jeremy whispered again to Crockta, \"Be careful.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAbout what?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Those guys and Chesswood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy pulled Crockta a little further away from the group.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Blackmore, I don\u2019t think he knows the news yet.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Jeremy squinted at Blackmore. Blackmore was playing his instrument with a bright face.\u00a0</span><span>\"Chesswood isn\u2019t an idle place right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is a land of discord due to the cursed people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>One user suddenly looked at the two of them. Jeremy slung his arm over Crockta and grinned. As the gaze of the user moved away, he whispered again in Crockta\u2019s ears.\u00a0</span><span>\"So these people over there are enemies.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Certainly, Enyanis of Arnin had referred to Chesswood as in a state of pandemonium.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you understand?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy hit Crockta\u2019s chest and released him. Blackmore\u2019s singing became louder.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the distance, the dim shape of a village started to appear.</span></p><br/><p>I will be turning off sponsored chapters for BEM and PTO for now while I catch up with Patreon chapters.

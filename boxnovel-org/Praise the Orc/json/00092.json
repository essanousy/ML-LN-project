It was the first time the creatures experienced the orc\u2019s greeting and they bumped fists with glee. In particular, the ogre looked at Crockta with passionate eyes as they said farewell.</span></p><br/><p><span>The cyclops stared with his one eye and said slowly, \"Next. You. I. Fight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul. I'm looking forward to it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The cyclops had been watching Crockta since he first came. There was no opportunity to compete since he received guidance from Gushantimur all day.\u00a0</span><span>The cyclops was bigger than the ogre and was full of hulking muscles!\u00a0</span><span>It would be an exciting match.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo was chatting with the goblin archer as well as the kobold guerilla archer.\u00a0</span><span>\"Next time we meet, I will turn you into a bee\u2019s nest with Vulcan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c</span><i><span>Kyak</span></i><span>!

The lich and its skeletons waved their handkerchiefs towards Anor.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur was last.\u00a0</span><span>The mysterious hermit of the Black Forest.\u00a0</span><span>His true identity was a friendly black dragon who helped practitioners break through the walls they encountered.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Listen to the very end.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s okay </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span> I will hear it next time </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur spoke to Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur knew right away that Tiyo was Hedor\u2019s son. They had a similar appearance and General had been Hedor\u2019s weapon. Gushantimur tried to tell him about Hedor but Tiyo refused.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now he had the goal to get rid of the crazy chieftain with Crockta. If he found out about his father, his goal might become clouded.\u00a0</span><span>After killing the great chieftain, Tiyo would return to this place and listen to Gushantimur\u2019s words about his father. It was also a pledge to come back here. Gushantimur respected his opinion.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut I will ask one thing </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo\u2019s face was determined.\u00a0</span><span>\"Is my father alive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur looked quietly at Tiyo and nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHe is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is enough. The rest will be told at the next opportunity.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo turned away. Kiao clapped behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur\u2019s gaze focused on Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou are going to the Temple of the Fallen God.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right. There...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur was still expressionless, but there was something in his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>He seemed to become lost in memories whenever he talked about the Temple of the Fallen God. However, Crockta didn\u2019t ask about it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"When things are done, can we come back here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\"Of course. You are my friends.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta felt his chest become hot.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta extended his fist and touched it with Gushantimur\u2019s fist.. Gushantimur met that fist.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let\u2019s see each other again. Stay alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You too.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a farewell.\u00a0</span><span>The moment he was going to turn around,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then someone spoke.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked towards the source of the sound.\u00a0</span><span>It was his waist.</span></p><br/><p><span>The demon\u2019s skull with steel teeth at his waist, the Demon\u2019s Mouth.\u00a0</span><span>At the moment, it spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He couldn\u2019t hear because it was a small sound. Crockta touched the belt. But it didn\u2019t say anything else. It looked like a normal steel belt like it had gone back to sleep.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This guy\u2019s situation...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the moment he turned to explain to Gushantimur,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur was watching Crockta with a surprised face.</span></p><br/><p><span>And...</span></p><br/><p><span>A flower bloomed.\u00a0</span><span>There was a faint smile on his face.\u00a0</span><span>The thin corners of his mouth covered in a bright smile for a short time.\u00a0</span><span>It was a beautiful expression on Gushantimur that Crockta had never seen before.\u00a0</span><span>His eyes were filled with laughter.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur kept the bright smile as he said to Crockta, \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for the day that we meet again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta didn\u2019t ask any more as he nodded with a smile.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>They left the Black Forest and headed to Nameragon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, perhaps you\u2019ve fallen </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat do you mean?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You looked stunned at Gushantimur\u2019s smile</span><i><span> dot.</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, no. I never...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hihihit, I didn\u2019t know that Crockta\u2019s taste was like that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you talking about? I am a heterosexual person who likes women.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why does that matter </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor started laughing.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cCrockta doesn\u2019t seem to know about dragons.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cToo ignorant </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta frowned and said, \"I don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo climbed Crockta\u2019s body and rode him like a horse. \u00a0</span><span>He stared at Nameragon in the distance and said, \u201cDragons have no gender </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. Wow, Nameragon is a big city.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Was there no gender, or were they a hermaphrodite?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNameragon is big. There are many people </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe thing before that...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, a dragon can be a man or a woman whenever necessary. Didn\u2019t you know? The next time you meet, Gushantimur might be a wonderful woman, hihihit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What, is this a scandal? Love between a dragon and orc? Ahh, good. Hahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Anor laughed at him. Crockta shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>It was clear that Anor was taking after the wrong role model.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We are almost there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta ignored them and identified Nameragon in the distance. It was still far away so he couldn\u2019t see it clearly.\u00a0</span><span>He used Heart and Soul Penetration. Not only did it have the ability to see through the enemy, but it also improved his eyesight.</span></p><br/><p><span>Wait.\u00a0</span><span>That reminded him, he got a new skill.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Status Window]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018One who wants to become a hero\u2019 Crockta, Orc Warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>Level: 65</span></p><br/><p><span>Achievement Points: 545400</span></p><br/><p><span>Assimilation: 86%</span></p><br/><p><span>Abilities: </span></p><br/><p><span>Peerless Mountain Seizing Strength (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Regeneration Authority (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Leyteno\u2019s Heart Swordsmanship (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Extreme Fighting Spirit (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Heart and Soul Penetration (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Tattoos of War, Honour and Fighting Spirit (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Army Crushing Roar of Madness (Pinnacle)</span></p><br/><p><span>Creatures Butcher (Essence)</span></p><br/><p><span>Unknown Mysterious Skill Before Use (???)]</span></p><br/><p><span>His new title \u2018One who wants to become a hero\u2019 was quite similar to the previous \u2018Person Pursuing the Pinnacle.\u2019 His skill experience would be accelerated until he reached the Hero rank. Since Pinnacle rank required more enlightenment than proficiency, it involved Crockta\u2019s proficiency and enlightenment.</span></p><br/><p><span>His level and achievement points had risen significantly. His ranking would also rise.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Lastly, there was the mysterious skill that he wouldn\u2019t know what it was until he used it.\u00a0</span><span>It really was a mystery.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stopped trying to use it.\u00a0</span><span>If the skill caused an explosion, there was a chance that Tiyo and Anor might get hurt.\u00a0</span><span>Or maybe it was something like a huge blade storm that would sweep around him and create a huge crater.\u00a0</span><span>Maybe a meteor would fall from the sky and cause an area of death.\u00a0</span><span>Or like a cartoon, his hair would turn blonde and his whole body would power up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is very difficult... Kulkulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s right.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was filled with great anticipation.</span></p><br/><p><span>Big expectations might lead to greater disappointment, but Crockta\u2019s chest was burning at the thought of the skill. Moreover, it was a skill he got from a dragon. There was no doubt that the skill would match the fury of a dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Your expression is sneaky Crockta. What are you thinking... perhaps...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Nothing.\"\u00a0</span><span>Crockta held out his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hmm, it is suspicious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo got down from Crockta\u2019s neck.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anyway, Nameragon is right in front of us! I'm running </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Let\u2019s go Anor!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He started running towards Nameragon. Anor followed with the agile movements of a dark elf.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was left alone.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta hesitated as he looked at the status window before using the skill.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnknown Mysterious Skill Before Use, activate!\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, why are you so slow </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No reason.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s face was strangely dark as he followed. Tiyo was confused.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you not want to get further away from Gushantimur? Look...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta picked up a stone and threw it. Tiyo agilely avoided it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHu, huhut! So sensitive </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t push him too hard. Doesn\u2019t Crockta need time to realize his feelings? Hahahahat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This guy Anor, he really knew how to trigger a person\u2019s anger.\u00a0</span><span>After Tiyo, he threw a stone towards Anor. Anor screamed and ran away.</span></p><br/><p><span>They arrived at the entrance of Nameragon.\u00a0</span><span>It was lacking compared to the continent, but the size was similar to Arnin that Crockta visited in the past.\u00a0</span><span>The moment they stood in front of the gate, dozens of bows aimed at them from the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grabbed the handle of his greatsword. Tiyo raised General.\u00a0</span><span>Anor hid behind Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWho are you?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>A dark elf on top of the gate said. He was dressed similar to the other dark elves on the wall, but a red cloak was wrapped around him.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cOrc, gnome. And a half breed with his ears cut. What a bizarre combination.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes narrowed.\u00a0</span><span>Then he politely said.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We have come to seek Nameragon\u2019s cooperation. I was recognized by the leaders of Orcheim, Dejame, and Altanas in the Luklan Mountains, as well as Nadia of Nuridot. My name is Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhh. Those guys.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The dark elf placed a foot on the railing of the wall.\u00a0</span><span>\"I heard that a trio was playing as a group of heroes in the north.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was an obvious taunt.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta realized that talking wouldn\u2019t change the outcome.\u00a0</span><span>He wasn\u2019t a person who would bow down in this type of situation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It will be difficult if you want to get our permission.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The conditions?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm... perhaps if you cut the necks of 50 of your kin? Or give me a box of gold. That much is needed for an orc to enter Nameragon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is too much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is reasonable, not too much...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta pulled out his greatsword before the elf finished speaking.\u00a0</span><span>\"Don't misunderstand.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Pulling your sword in front of us, are you crazy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Listen up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A huge momentum came from Crockta\u2019s body. The gate in front of him was big and thick. It was something that most people wouldn\u2019t even think about breaking through.\u00a0</span><span>But he was different.</span></p><br/><p><span>The world slowed down.\u00a0</span><span>It was the world of the Pinnacle that he could freely enter after training with Gushantimur.\u00a0</span><span>In the world of the Pinnacle, the gate was just a piece of wood.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s vision was different now.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI might not be allowed in here, but I am being polite and understanding.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s greatsword crossed the space.\u00a0</span><span>A tremendous amount of power poured from Ogre Slayer. It crossed the space and slammed against the gate.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kwa kwa kwa kwa!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>A large crack was formed on the ground between Crockta and the gate.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The dark elf yelled with surprise.</span></p><br/><p><span>The gate collapsed.\u00a0</span><span>Beyond the ruined gate, the landscape of Nameragon could be seen. It was moderately developed. The dark elves passing by stared at him in astonishment.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta told the dark elves above the gates.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We can enter Nameragon whenever we want. Please know that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI won\u2019t enter out of consideration for you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The dark elves who witnessed Crockta\u2019s action couldn\u2019t say anything.\u00a0</span><span>Then the one in charge opened his mouth again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You, doing this, you\u2019ve become our enemy...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But Crockta just turned around.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta turned his back to Nameragon without any fear. Tiyo asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is okay </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?

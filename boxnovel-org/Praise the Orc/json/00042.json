Jeremy stroked the handle of his sword, his tension subsiding. No matter what happened, it would fine as long as he had his sword. He was a swordsman, a born killer that even Derek acknowledged.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was also aware from Derek that the orc was a powerful warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMister, there is smoke,\u201d The woman suddenly said. </span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore stopped playing his musical instrument.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat's going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Smoke continued to emerge from the village, gradually covering the sky above the village.\u00a0</span><span>Blackmore\u2019s face stiffened.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThis... It looks like a fire. I should hurry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore rushed towards the village with his musical instrument on his shoulders.\u00a0</span><span>As Blackmore prepared to move, one user walked over and knocked him over.\u00a0</span><span>Blackmore tumbled down to the ground. A corner of the musical instrument was destroyed. He lay on the floor and moaned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cW-What...kuoohh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The users chuckled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It has already started.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hey, wait for me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There isn\u2019t enough here to share.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta watched the users talking.\u00a0</span><span>Jeremy shrugged and pulled out his sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBrother, didn\u2019t I tell you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is why I hate the cursed ones. They are scum that will hit people in the back.\"\u00a0</span><span>Jeremy glanced at Crockta and added, \"Of course, I will watch you more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The users approached them. Unlike Blackmore, the two of them had weapons and one of them was an orc, so the users were cautious.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Will you be okay against an orc?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Believe in me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>All of the users pulled out their weapons. The magician stepped back and prepared to support from the rear.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you kids are in danger, then call for me.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The female user who first talked to Blackmore grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\"Anyway, our kids are in control of areas A1 to C4.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy whistled. His long sword sparkled in the sun. It was small compared to Crockta\u2019s sword, but the amount of human blood that had covered it was enough to make a small stream.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Guys, don\u2019t you see that this orc brother is angry? Do you want him to be angry? Do you want to bleed?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Jeremy joked around as he narrowed the distance. His movements were light.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta also held his greatsword and lowered his center of gravity, \u00a0gathering enough momentum to break through at once.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta scanned the area. It seemed that it was possible to take care of the front line, but the magician was the problem. He was already muttering something to complete a spell.</span></p><br/><p><span>Magicians were always bothersome opponents.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta carefully looked for gaps in the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment... Crockta\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>Suddenly, the magician fell without a sound.\u00a0</span><span>Blackmore was standing behind the magician. Blackmore met Crockta\u2019s eyes and winked.\u00a0</span><span>The crowd in front was still unaware of what happened to the magician. Crockta nodded and charged forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shouting the battle cry of the orc warriors before battle had now become a habit.\u00a0</span><span>Jeremy also ran after Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta rushed and swung his greatsword, the users pushed back by the impact. Jeremy leapt from behind Crockta and instantly pierced a user\u2019s neck with his sword.\u00a0</span><span>He was like the wind.</span></p><br/><p><span>The confused users yelled out, \u201cMagic! Use it quickly! Why aren\u2019t you using it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then they paled as they turned around.\u00a0</span><span>Blackmore didn\u2019t care as he looked at them with his foot on the magician\u2019s chest. At that moment, the users felt sure of their deaths.</span></p><br/><p><span>It seemed like they could already feel Crockta and Jeremy\u2019s blades against their skin.</span></p><br/><p><span>Their heads flew through the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Jeremy were too strong for them. They weren\u2019t just ordinary people, or various minstrels passing by, but a real orc warrior and a notorious swordsman from the back alleys of the fugitive city of Anail.</span></p><br/><p><span>The users\u2019 bodies turned white.\u00a0</span><span>It was the last of those cursed by the stars.\u00a0</span><span>Their equipment fell to the ground. There was nothing that looked great. Besides, they needed to hurry to the village.</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore immediately started running towards the village. Jeremy and Crockta looked at each other and ran after him.</span></p><br/><p><span>The village was a terrible mess.\u00a0</span><span>Several houses were burning.\u00a0</span><span>Battles between NPCs and users were occurring in various places in the village.</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore looked around and found a piece of farm equipment. He broke the edge and made it into a club, swinging it in the air.</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy and Crockta glanced at each other as they saw it.\u00a0</span><span>Blackmore\u2019s actions were quite skilled. Blackmore squeezed the rod, like he was trying to regain some old senses, before running into battle.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Jeremy also helped in the battles. The villagers were all farmers, but they used their equipment to fight against the users. Their attacks turned one or two users into white particles.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s greatsword beheaded a user.</span></p><br/><p><span>The users were too weak.\u00a0</span><span>There were some decent ones, but the majority of them looked like beginners that had just started Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>There were many people who ran away from Crockta\u2019s fearsome appearance.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOrc!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRun away! An orc!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Run away! Let's go!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m scared!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMonster!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The users hurriedly ran away.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta didn\u2019t have a chance to fight properly with them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy giggled and knocked against Crockta\u2019s shoulder with a teasing attitude.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHey, Brother. Brother\u2019s face, well, it no longer frightens me as much. Don\u2019t take it personally.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNoisy.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta turned around before adding something else.\u00a0</span><span>\"I am a handsome orc.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s right.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was a handsome orc. In Orcrox, the female NPCs often ogled him. He had customized his face to be as horrible as possible to make fun of his sister, but it seemed to be attractive to orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy burst out laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBy the way, what\u2019s going on here? The cursed people are gathering together and attacking. Besides, aren\u2019t they all weak?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta confirmed the equipment of the users that fell on the ground.\u00a0</span><span>They were all Common grade equipment.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI can roughly guess.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The users whom they defeated with Blackmore said that their area was from A1 to C4, and the users here had poor combat abilities.\u00a0</span><span>The local characteristic of Chesswood was that the villages were scattered about in a checkered pattern.</span></p><br/><p><span>The recurring evils that humans committed in online games were being repeated in Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Blackmore! You came back!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Blackmore?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a disturbance. The villagers finished fighting and discovered that Blackmore had returned.\u00a0</span><span>However, their reaction wasn\u2019t like what Crockta expected.\u00a0</span><span>Rather, it was the opposite.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why did this guy all of a sudden...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI thought you left?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were reluctant to talk to Blackmore.\u00a0</span><span>Some even spat on the ground, like he was unlucky.</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore just looked down and touched his half-broken instrument.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHaha. Blackmore, becoming a minstrel, I really can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Jeremy stayed at the home of Blackmore\u2019s uncle, Ingram. He was tall, sturdy, and looked very strong for his age.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You didn\u2019t originally leave your home to become a minstrel?\u201d They asked.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Blackmore? This guy was completely...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Ingram grinned as he gaze at Blackmore.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cA bully.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I wasn\u2019t that bad,\u201d Blackmore pleaded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Weren\u2019t you a gangster working for a private money lender?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore dropped his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy couldn\u2019t help shaking his head.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta nodded in agreement. </span><span>Then he whispered to Jeremy, \u201cA bully, a gangster.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...Ugh.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Jeremy struck Crockta with his elbow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"All he knew was how to fight and how to wield a spear, and that was all he did in Chesswood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I didn\u2019t do too badly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Blackmore became notorious in Chesswood. He was a called a cruel bastard, a man with no feelings.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Under the full moon, Ingram treated the two humans and one orc to his homemade beer. The taste was quite good.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta thought it was comparable to the beer that he drank in Orcrox.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I regret it,\u201d Blackwood said.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, I didn\u2019t hear from you after you left Chesswood. So how did you become a minstrel?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore's explanation wasn't long.</span></p><br/><p><span>After leaving Chesswood, he wandered from place to place. With his skills, there was work wherever he went. He worked as a mercenary, a soldier, an escort, and various other things, but there was always regret in his heart.\u00a0</span><span>He made money from people\u2019s suffering.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then by chance, he saw a minstrel playing at a pub.\u00a0</span><span>The minstrel\u2019s skills weren\u2019t that great, but he saw people laughing and having fun. Blackmore was eating expensive food in a room that was much more expensive than theirs, but he seemed more unhappy.</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, he abandoned everything and became a minstrel. That was 10 years ago.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The most emotionless person is doing the most sentimental job in the world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore laughed bitterly, \"Isn\u2019t it because of that child?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore gulped down his beer and asked,\u00a0</span><span>\"How is she?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Married.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"To who?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A decent person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then that's fine. Say no more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore also seemed to have his own story of heartbreak. His mood became so heavy that Ingram, Crockta, and Jeremy couldn\u2019t open their mouths.\u00a0</span><span>Blackmore changed the topic and spoke, \u201cThe people cursed by the stars keep coming?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, it\u2019s serious. I tried to ask for help but...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The villages united to block the attacks of those cursed by the stars, but it was getting harder.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes sunk.\u00a0</span><span>This area must\u2019ve been designated as a hunting ground to level up, with the areas distributed between different clans.\u00a0</span><span>It was rare for NPCs with high levels to be scattered around villages like these. There were also no professional guards.</span></p><br/><p><span>The best hunting ground. In addition, the clans would be controlling the hunting grounds in order to monopolize it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tomorrow, the Chesswood village leaders have decided to meet to discuss the problem,\u201d Ingram said.</span></p><br/><p><span>Blackmore continued to drink before rising from his seat.\u00a0</span><span>\"Uncle, I have become a minstrel, so I will sing you a song. However, my instrument is broken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hoh, is it a song that you made?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right. I missed this place, so I made a song for Chesswood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If it\u2019s terrible, then I\u2019ll stop listening straight away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Blackmore started to sing.\u00a0</span><span>Unlike Ingram\u2019s worries, it was a wonderful melody. The introductory part was strangely sad, but then it became more exciting.</span></p><br/><p><span>The audience clapped in time with him.\u00a0</span><span>As they listened to the lyrics, they felt like they were the narrator rejoicing as he ran towards his hometown.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I have travelled to many places in the world, always looking for new things. But I realized something. I had already found the things that I was looking for.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Dancing under the moonlight, singing in the rain. Oh! I\u2019m happy to be back home! Laughing under the sun, running along different trails. Ah! I\u2019m happy to be back home!\u201d</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule: \u00a0<strong>Another Patreon goal has been reached!!

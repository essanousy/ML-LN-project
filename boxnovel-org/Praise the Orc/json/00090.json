It was pending until he left the lair.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Defeating my guardians was a great feat. Most people give up and run away in the middle,\u201d said Gushantimur</span></p><br/><p><span>He had felt the terrible power of Gushantimur after the real landscape of this place was revealed. It was a dragon\u2019s majesty that would cause someone to tremble in fear just being in its presence.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou\u2019re a dragon?\u201d asked Anor.</span></p><br/><p><span>The strong magic that changed the landscape in an instant, the terms \u2018lair\u2019 and \u2018guardians\u2019 and the fearful atmosphere truly matched the characteristics of a dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right. You, who has the blood of a necromancer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A necromancer contained the ancient lineage of a god. I have never seen such a thick concentration in the blood for many years.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur raised a hand to his face. It was the face of a young man, but there was a sense of longevity about him.\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou should be proud.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>It was a shameful power that he had covered up for all his life. Those who could raise the dead were often a target of fear for other people. Even his mother had given up the bloodline and sealed it.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, this mighty dragon said to be proud of it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The power to connect the dead to this world isn\u2019t within the strength of a mortal. But an old god who is troubled by those who suffer due to eternal parting has given you strength. This is the mercy and blessing of a god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor scratched his head. \u00a0He had never heard such a compliment and didn\u2019t know how to respond. He just bowed with a red face.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut it is lacking.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The most you can do now is raise bodies and learn to control them. You haven\u2019t reached true necromancy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>This time Gushantimur\u2019s eyes headed towards Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tiyo, brave son of the gnome, Hedor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>\"You know my father?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are lacking compared to your father.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The dragon not only knew Tiyo\u2019s father\u2019s name, but also said that Tiyo was lacking compared to him. It was as if he knew Tiyo\u2019s father well.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The artifact that you are using has no limit on its power. But you have already set a limit in your heart.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you saying </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"General is a Dragon Light General, a god\u2019s weapon created by the gold dragon Abogullad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A dragon\u2019s weapon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Raise your own vessel\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo staggered like he was shocked.\u00a0</span><span>\"M-My vessel is small </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He had lived as a macho person. Everybody praised him as a man with large vessel.\u00a0</span><span>But the black dragon pointed out his vessel.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"General\u2019s true name is \u2018Dragonslayer\u2019.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c.......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is a dragon weapon designed to kill dragons. But you can\u2019t catch an ogre with it, let alone a dragon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo flopped down. His eyes shook wildly.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur\u2019s eyes now turned towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta prepared himself.\u00a0</span><span>The system said that the meeting itself was a reward. Gushantimur might\u2019ve seemed stricken at first, but he had given them important facts that would eventually become a foundation for their growth.\u00a0</span><span>Those who didn\u2019t listen to him wouldn\u2019t grow further.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta faced Gushantimur and waited for what he would point out.\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur opened his mouth, \u201cWonderful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Keep trying hard. More than this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grabbed Gushantimur who was turning around.\u00a0</span><span>\"Excuse me, point out something.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere is nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don't lie.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...It is okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes. Please point out what I am lacking. Unreservedly!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hmm, if you want...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This dragon was a surprisingly good person. He gazed at Crockta coolly and opened his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>\"You have reached the Pinnacle level.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That\u2019s accurate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Pinnacle!\u00a0</span><span>It had been Crockta\u2019s target ever since Hoyt had first showed it to him. It was an area he had barely reached after defeating the behemoth.\u00a0</span><span>It was difficult at first but he gradually got used to it. Now all of Crockta\u2019s movements contained the enlightenment of the Pinnacle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Look beyond that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>As the name implied, he thought Pinnacle was the end. The power of the Pinnacle was enough to defeat most enemies, but there was more beyond that?</span></p><br/><p><span>The mentors who taught Crockta were Lenox, Hoyt and Baek Hanho. And they had only mentioned the Pinnacle. There might be high and low abilities in that area, but none of them had seen beyond it.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was fairly unexplored.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The Pinnacle state is to become one with the world.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur said, \"But beyond that, there is an area where you can wield the world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is your goal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s body trembled in anticipation.\u00a0</span><span>He wanted to swing his sword straight away.\u00a0</span><span>Move the world according to his own will. Was that even possible?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What is it called?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\"The people who managed to do it, they were all lauded as Heroes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hero rating!</span></p><br/><p><span>The Despairing Demon\u2019s Mouth belt that he was wearing was also a Hero rank item. At the time, the power of the demon was terrifying. If he hadn\u2019t convinced the demon then Quantes would\u2019ve disappeared from the map.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was possible for individuals to have such a mighty power.\u00a0</span><span>The next step after Pinnacle was the Hero rating.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I didn\u2019t think you would be able to beat all my guardians. But in the end, we all have endless possibilities for growth,\u201d said Gushantimur</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the doors of the castle opened.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The creatures they beat were gathered there.</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogre who cornered Crockta with martial arts, the goblin archer who played with Tiyo, the lich who showed a higher level of undead magic than Anor, the axe-wielding troop and lizardman spearman, the direwolf who attacked them like a ninja and the kobold archer were all gathered there.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGrrr.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogre discovered Crockta and raised a thumb. Crockta also responded with his thumb. The ogre had a bandage wrapped around its head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cT-that guy...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo pointed at the goblin. The goblin wearing a splint sat down on the ground. He found Tiyo and made a cutting motion across his neck. He would finish Tiyo next time!</span></p><br/><p><span>\"My guardians are all those aiming for a higher world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The black dragon Gushantimur liked to stay in this forest and help others grow. </span><span>But that didn\u2019t mean everyone could get his help. They had to pass the test of his guardians. And the guardians would gradually build up their levels from the test.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How about it, Travelers?\u201d asked Gushantimur.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWon\u2019t you knock down the wall that you see here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a sweet seduction.\u00a0</span><span>The guardians were staring at them, as if daring them to come.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"In fact, the truly strong ones were considerate towards you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Beyond the guardians was a huge cyclops.\u00a0</span><span>He looked at Crockta and laughed. Then he stroked the head of the ogre that Crockta defeated.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyebrows twitched.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you confident to beat them with your strength?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at Tiyo and Anor in turn.\u00a0</span><span>The reactions of the two were different.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo\u2019s eyes were burning with fighting spirit.\u00a0</span><span>Anor slightly shook his head with a frightened expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo said, \"You must be scared </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor reflexively replied, \"No, you jerk!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah...ah?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo pushed Anor. Crockta followed behind them.\u00a0</span><span>They entered the lair of the dragon Gushantimur.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur\u2019s castle was magnificent. Who could imagine that such a huge castle would be hidden in the forest? It was an area hidden by magic, just like Shakan\u2019s fortress. As expected from a dragon\u2019s lair, it contained gold and silver.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I once lived in a cave like any other dragon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur explained as he guided them, \"But I realized after experiencing an incident. The real treasure isn\u2019t gold but friends.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The words that old men always said when they became drunk!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Friends are treasure.'</span></p><br/><p><span>But he couldn\u2019t help being convinced as he gazed at the young beauty against the backdrop of the wonderful castle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"So I made a castle using gold and treasures. I became friends with those seeking enlightenment after reaching the limit. One or two visited me, and the number of friends gradually increased.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There were weapons everywhere in his castle. And the creatures were polishing and sharpening their skills.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy are there no humans, elves, or orcs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Everybody left.\"\u00a0</span><span>There was no change in Gushantimur\u2019s face, but Crockta thought he somehow looked lonely.\u00a0</span><span>\"All of them left after achieving a certain level in order to gain wealth and honor. But these guys are different.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If they go outside, they might be hunted as unusual monsters. They have no place to go. They have transcended the limits of their species and wish to seek a larger world, but that world only despises them as creatures. They have already tasted the wider world and can\u2019t be satisfied with hunting and looting like their people, so there is no place for them to go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur laughed calmly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will keep them with me until the day they can be recognized. They will never betray me and I will also never betray them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta realized something.\u00a0</span><span>This dragon wasn\u2019t just a dragon.\u00a0</span><span>He was a hot-blooded dragon.\u00a0</span><span>Who could call this man a cold-blooded reptile?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Gushantimur, we won\u2019t stay here for a long time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I guessed so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But we want to be your friend.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur burst out laughing.\u00a0</span><span>His laughter was clear.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, you are saying strange things.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Aren\u2019t we already friends?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Warm.\u00a0</span><span>This man, he was warmer than Crockta expected.\u00a0</span><span>They were already friends with this warm man.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Now, my friends are waiting for you. Unpack and come out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s group unpacked their belongings in the room that Gushantimur guided them to. Then they immediately went outside while armed.\u00a0</span><span>Outside, spars were already in full swing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Come.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur was standing there after changing his clothing. He was dressed in clothes that allowed easy movement. When they first met, he seemed like a scholar or magician. But a sharp momentum was coming from him now that he was holding a sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anor, you should learn from this friend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the bony lich. It laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHiik..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Your biggest problem as a necromancer is your timid nature.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor was speechless as the lich placed an arm around his shoulder. The skull was terrifying for him.\u00a0</span><span>\"Become friends with death.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKelkelkel! Do you trust me? Kelkelkel!\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span>\"Aack!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor moaned at the lich\u2019s laugh.\u00a0</span><span>Thus, Anor was dragged away by the lich. The skeletons followed them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now it was Tiyo\u2019s turn.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tiyo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Your weakness is your small vessel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d declared Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>He seemed to have recovered from being told that he had a small vessel.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you saying </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! I am a man who never had a reputation for being small </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! This is the first time I\u2019ve heard that my vessel is small. It really is the first time. Hahaha, how funny </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. A person with a strange dream is calling me small </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! I am someone who received 500 medals </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Take back what you just said! I\u2019m not small! I am Tiyo who joined the Quantes garrison since I was young...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur looked at Crockta. Crockta nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIsn\u2019t it accurate?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It\u2019s accurate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t agree with him Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gushantimur coughed.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Cough, well there seems to be a misunderstanding. The thing I am talking about isn\u2019t your nature. Well, now that I see your personality...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don't worry. In any case, the small vessel is your imagination. Lend me General for a moment.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo handed General over to Gushantimur with a sour face.\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur held General.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment,</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>General changed.\u00a0</span><span>General was in the form of a long rifle, but then the muzzle widened, the column expanded and it took the appearance of a bigger weapon.\u00a0</span><span>It was like a cannon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"T-this is.....\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"General is as strong as your imagination and willpower.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Gushantimur aimed the muzzle towards the air and pulled the trigger.\u00a0</span><span>The magic power around General was sucked in fiercely. A light emerged from the barrel and a mass of energy was fired.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Roaaaaar!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The magic shell flew into the sky. Then the light flashed and there was a huge explosion.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kwaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The colorful magic power in the sky looked like fireworks.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Unbelievable...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo had been using General for a long time, so he couldn\u2019t help staring with a frozen expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"T-this is...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is the true power of the weapon. The Light Dragon General is incomparably powerful when I use it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>General reverted back to the form of a rifle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI-I will do that guise again. I will make an even better cannon! Amazing </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is up to you. Tiyo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ohhh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo took the rifle and examined it. However, General looked exactly the same as before.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The one who will teach you is the great goblin, Kiao.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You finally came</span><i><span> kyakk</span></i><span>!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>It was the goblin that showed Tiyo the storm</span>\u00a0archery. Kaio walked forward with his short bow.</p><br/><p><span>\"I already defeated that guy</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tiyo. Take a look at Kiao.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kiao shrugged.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Shooting the tree and knocking him out is praiseworthy. Indeed, it is the move of a soldier used to actual fighting. But if Kiao had used his true strength, you wouldn\u2019t be standing here.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gushantimur declared.\u00a0</span><span>\"If he really fired the arrow with all his strength, your body would\u2019ve disappeared in that spatiotemporal storm without a trace.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>A spatiotemporal storm!\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo couldn\u2019t refute it. Certainly, the goblin had the power to create a storm with his bow and arrow. But creating a spatiotemporal storm!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKiao is also a great mentor. His power will help with General. Learn well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kiao giggled and poked Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>\"Let\u2019s go </span><i><span>kyak</span></i><span>!

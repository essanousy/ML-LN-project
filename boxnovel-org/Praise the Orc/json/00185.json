Why?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I am just following the will of God. God has commanded you to die. I borrowed his power and came to kill you according to his words. That is all.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhich god?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe elder god of the mountain, where you will reap all the blood you sowed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was confused.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had heard of the elder god of the mountain. It was a small religion spread over the mountain areas of the continent. Those who lived in the mountains mainly followed it, but in comparison to its rustic image, the religion had a cruel doctrine.\u00a0</span><span>However, why did the elder god of the mountain suddenly want to kill him?</span></p><br/><p><span>While Crockta was thinking, the man continued speaking,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAccept your fate. Other people will come...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere are others?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou really don\u2019t know anything. That isn\u2019t all. All the gods on this continent have commanded your death. Even the goddess of mercy desires your death.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s expression distorted.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe can\u2019t know the minds of the gods. You must\u2019ve done something bad to incur the wrath of the gods. Repent, Crockta. An eye for an eye, blood for blood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t understand that reasoning.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta raised his greatsword. </span></p><br/><p><span>The man shouted,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI have failed today, but in the end, the gods will find you! In the end...! Kuheok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta kicked the man\u2019s belly. The man curled up on the ground. Crockta looked down at the man, and laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are too noisy. I just want to find out the situation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh..!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man sprawled out on the ground.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThe orcs will not survive the wrath of the gods!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta lowered his posture and stared at the man.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe orcs?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes! The gods desire not just your death but the death of all the orcs! You will perish!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his gaze and stared at the group of hooded men, followers of the elder god of the mountain.\u00a0</span><span>They flinched from his murderous gaze. They couldn\u2019t even think about raising their weapons as they stepped back.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta growled,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIs that true?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They couldn\u2019t open their mouths, causing Crockta to grab the neck of the collapsed man, who was shouting about the will of the gods. Then at that moment, the man couldn\u2019t breathe.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeeok! Ke....!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnswer me. Do the gods really want to kill the orcs as well as me? Is that the divine message of your god?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta got up.\u00a0</span><span>The man struggled. He was breathless and clutching at Crockta\u2019s wrist.\u00a0</span><span>Looking at the man\u2019s pained appearance, the other followers and cried out, </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cY-Yes. The words are correct. So, let go of him quickly!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKill all the orcs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, the gods said so. To make the orcs a forgotten species.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded. Then he threw the man.\u00a0</span><span>The man flew towards the other followers, causing the group to fall and roll across the ground. In the turmoil, some of the hoods fell off.\u00a0</span><span>They were all ordinary humans, ordinary people who looked after the fields or hunted in the mountains.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta muttered,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhy do the gods want the death of me and all the orcs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>What was going on?\u00a0</span><span>The followers edged away helplessly. Crockta noticed them, but he then said with a sigh,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGet lost.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>It was like giving permission. They ran away hastily as soon as Crockta\u2019s words ended.\u00a0</span><span>Only the man\u2019s weapon remained on the ground. Crockta grabbed it.\u00a0</span><span>It was an ordinary sword. However, when the light of divine power surrounded it, the sword emitted a force which was hard for Crockta to deal with.</span></p><br/><p><span>Beings with this power were aiming at the orcs...\u00a0</span><span>Not just one orc but all of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is definitely a headache.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Why couldn\u2019t they leave him in peace?\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t possible for him to stay still after hearing that the gods were aiming at all the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy are the gods doing this <em>dot</em>? Did you speak ill of the gods?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo asked after watching the scene. Crockta shrugged,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know. It would be really unfair even if I did.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is true. There is always a mountain after crossing a mountain <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGreat chieftain, empire, and now the gods\u2026 Will everything be okay?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor looked at Crockta with trembling eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped, even if it isn\u2019t okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen shouldn\u2019t you head quickly to the other orcs? They are aiming at the orcs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed <em>dot</em>. Quickly. I can find my father later, so let\u2019s fight with Crockta\u2019s friends <em>dot</em>!\u00a0Against those gods!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta thought about it.\u00a0</span><span>If orcs were the target, then Orcrox and Basque Village came to mind. There was also the land of the orcs in the north.\u00a0</span><span>However, those who borrowed the power of the gods couldn\u2019t invade it. Perhaps the gods\u2019 followers were already moving.</span></p><br/><p><span>In that case, even one more person would help.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then someone interrupted.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cStay a little longer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Zakiro.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cZakiro.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere is no one crazy enough to fight all the orcs immediately after the gods have sent the divine message. The present era isn\u2019t a time where the gods can run rampant like before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo, there is no need to worry?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, there is no need to hurry. Even if things will happen, there is still time. The followers have to look at their own interests and circumstances. They will gather the forces slowly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro wasn\u2019t looking at Crockta while talking.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta followed Zakiro\u2019s glance and confirmed what he was watching.\u00a0</span><span>It was Ogre Slayer in Crockta\u2019s hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou need to be prepared if you really want to fight the gods.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPrepared?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro raised his gaze towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta shrank back from the look in Zakiro\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span>There were flames blazing in Zakiro\u2019s eyes, and they weren\u2019t of a small fire.\u00a0</span><span>It was a furnace that could melt iron.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am going to fix Ogre Slayer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHahahahat!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Someone was laughing.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cSo, you tried to kill us? You? Really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She tugged at the hair of the human she had captured.\u00a0</span><span>She was sitting on top of a tower of human bodies. The man at the very top wasn\u2019t dead yet.\u00a0</span><span>He shivered and begged for forgiveness.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPlease\u2026 stop...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStop?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She pulled the hair with more strength. The man\u2019s neck was pulled back, and he couldn\u2019t talk anymore.\u00a0</span><span>She pushed her face against his.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSay it again, again. If you won and we lost, would you stop if we told you to stop?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeooook...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhere is your confidence from earlier? Huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She grabbed the ax at her waist. It wasn\u2019t big and looked more like a throwing ax. She raised the ax to the man\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSay it again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPlease...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI might forgive you. Tell me again what you said when you first saw us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cForgive...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She looked annoyed,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIf you say it, I will forgive you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She pierced the man\u2019s eyes with the ax. Blood flowed from it.\u00a0</span><span>The man shrieked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNow, tell me before it becomes more painful. What did you say when you first found us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHeok, kuheok... First, first...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. The first thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI-In the name of the gods...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnd?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cK-Kill Crockta and the orcs, k-kill...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWrong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She wielded the ax again.\u00a0</span><span>The man\u2019s nose was split. The man screamed, and blood burst out.</span></p><br/><p><span>She started humming,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeoook...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKill the dirty and rodent-like orcs, mutilate their bodies, and hang them at the gates.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She hummed and swung her ax again. Every time her arm moved, blood splattered on the man\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span>More and more, the appearance of a person was becoming less visible.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKill, did you say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPle...please...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen I will take your life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She rose from her spot. Then she grabbed the man\u2019s neck and pushed him down.\u00a0</span><span>The man rolled down the pile of bodies and fell to the bottom.\u00a0</span><span>Her followers, who were continuing the massacre, asked her,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cCaptain! What should we do now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey want to kill us, so we can\u2019t let them live.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKulkulkul, good!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They wielded their weapons, and terrible screams were heard.\u00a0</span><span>Suddenly, she saw a man crawling on the ground in order to run away. She threw her ax.\u00a0</span><span>It was aimed accurately at the man.\u00a0</span><span>The ax tore through the air and split apart his head.\u00a0</span><span>Brain matter flowed down.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKill those who want to live.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is over, Captain Anya!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou did well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She was an orc warrior known as the mad slaughterer, notorious for being a crazy berserker.\u00a0</span><span>The \u2018mad slaughterer\u2019 Anya...\u00a0</span><span>She had declared revenge on the noble who killed Lenox, torturing him and killing his followers. That was the berserker Anya.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya laughed as the slaughter finished and muttered,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuhuhut. That Crockta, he has become a big man.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya remembered when she first saw Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>She had come to Orcrox for Lenox\u2019s funeral and seen the apprentice warrior who had been the last one to speak with Lenox.\u00a0</span><span>His behavior was awkward but the willpower burning in his eyes seemed like something he\u2019d inherited from Lenox.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cConquering the north, thwarting the empire, and now fighting the gods?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya\u2019s eyes shone.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHis skills...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She laughed again.\u00a0</span><span>Then at that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span>The air near her distorted.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya frowned,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat, all of a sudden!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The figure of an orc slowly appeared. He looked at Anya with his translucent body, and his shape gradually became clear.\u00a0</span><span>He was a bald male orc without a single stitch of clothing, while necklaces made of all types of animal bones and skulls were hanging around his neck. Additionally, a strangely bent staff was held in his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the shaman who pursued the abyss, \u2018Abyss Seeker\u2019 Wallachwi.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLenox and Crockta\u2026 Kuhul...hulhul...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShut up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI thought you had a strange taste\u2026 You also like the young\u2026 Kuhulhul...hul...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou really make me feel bad. How long have you been here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know...? Kuhul...hul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya grabbed another ax from her waist. However, it couldn\u2019t touch Wallachwi and passed straight through his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is no use. Kuhul...hul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWitchcraft is really nasty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya licked her lips and placed the ax back on her waist.\u00a0</span><span>Anya\u2019s subordinates finished their work and greeted Wallachwi.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWallachwi! It is great to see you after so long! Kuhulhul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am alive! Bul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI heard the news! Crockta is doing something fun! Kulkulkul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere will be a festival again! Kuhahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFight, fight!\u201d They laughed while shouting.\u00a0</span><span>Indeed, they were the berserkers who followed Anya.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya smiled at them before asking Wallachwi,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cAre you going? To Orcrox?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A divine message had been passed against the entire orc species.\u00a0</span><span>They always wandered around the continent, but since this had happened, they needed to return to Orcrox.\u00a0</span><span>Just like when all the great orcs on the continent had returned home for Lenox\u2019s funeral.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course. Kuhul...hul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Wallachwi smiled. Anya nodded. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cZankus?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe will go after finishing a hunt\u2026 Kuhuhu...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is he hunting? That abnormal bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Her followers shouted,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWe\u2019re done!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. Then let\u2019s go!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After completing the massacre, Anya\u2019s group started to head towards Orcrox, and next to Anya was the translucent shaman shaking his staff.\u00a0</span><span>It had been a while since Lenox had died.\u00a0</span><span>In the meantime, the north had opened, and the kingdom had become an empire.\u00a0</span><span>An immature apprentice warrior had become a great warrior...\u00a0</span><span>And now, the gods wanted to kill the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>The legendary powerhouses of the orcs began to gather again.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

The dark elves were shaken by the appearance of the siege weapons.\u00a0The chieftain, who normally would\u2019ve run directly at the gate, was staring at it with his arms folded.</p><br/><p>\"Counter measures!\"</p><br/><p>\"Unfold the shields!\u201d</p><br/><p>\"Use the magic!\u201d</p><br/><p>\"We can\u2019t allow it to hit!\u201d</p><br/><p>Opinions differed.\u00a0Several orc soldiers were loading tremendous rocks onto the trebuchets. Once the bar holding down the launcher was removed, the weight caused the levers to rotate and the rock to be thrown.\u00a0Dozens of these weapons were lined up on the plain, all ready to immediately fire towards the walls.</p><br/><p>Crockta looked at the troops. There weren\u2019t any countermeasures for the siege weapons. In addition, they were out of reach of the arrows. If this was the case, the walls would be one-sidedly hit.</p><br/><p>\u201cOrcs are moderately smart <em>dot</em>.\u201d</p><br/><p>Tiyo muttered to himself.</p><br/><p>The rocks flew and the dark elves bent down.</p><br/><p><em>Kwaaaang!</em></p><br/><p><em>Kwaang!</em></p><br/><p><em>Kwa kwa kwa kwang!</em></p><br/><p>There was the sound of the impact as the walls shook violently. The dark elves couldn\u2019t balance themselves and sat down.\u00a0Crockta leaned over and stared at a distant place.</p><br/><p>Calmahart, the great chieftain, was laughing.\u00a0Then he raised a hand.</p><br/><p>The orcs once again rolled rocks and loaded them on the trebuchets. Thanks to the unique strength of the orcs, the huge rocks were lifted and continued to fly, like an exaggerated war scene from a medieval movie.</p><br/><p><em>Kwaaaang!</em></p><br/><p>Crocka endured the shock and glared at Calmahart. His eyes passed by Calmahart towards the shaman standing behind him.\u00a0The shaman was the cause of all of this.\u00a0At the moment, he seemed to meet the shaman\u2019s eyes. However, the rocks hit the wall and shook his balance again. Crockta grabbed onto the wall.</p><br/><p>\u201cBallista!\u201d</p><br/><p>The dark elves hurriedly loaded a large crossbow. They put a big arrow as large as a spear into it and lit it on fire. The fire arrows were aimed at a trebuchet.\u00a0Dozens of fire arrows and rocks crossed in the air.</p><br/><p>The gate shook and several trebuchets were burned. Nevertheless, the rocks continued to fly.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuheeok!\u201d</p><br/><p>A rock was aimed at the railing on the wall. The whole area was overwhelmed and the dark elves standing there died instantly.\u00a0As the dust from the rocks continued to rise, the morale of the dark elves fell.</p><br/><p>Crockta peered through the dust that blurred his vision.\u00a0The orcs had started their march.</p><br/><p>\"Attack!\u201d</p><br/><p>\"The enemy is advancing!\"</p><br/><p>\"Fire!\"</p><br/><p>The commanders called out.\u00a0The dark elves pulled back their bows in unison but were unable to maintain their positions, due to the subsequent bombardment. The orcs were repeatedly aiming at the wall railings.</p><br/><p><em>Hwiiiing!</em></p><br/><p>\u201cCough!\u201d</p><br/><p>One rock flew next to Crockta. The dark elf who couldn\u2019t avoid it had his head burst appear, then the rock continued and slammed into the interior of the city. A building collapsed.</p><br/><p>\"Dammit.\"\u00a0Crockta bit his lip. He hadn\u2019t imagined this. The orcs, who Crockta believed would rush indiscriminately, were attacking Spinoa in a calm manner.</p><br/><p>\"Why didn\u2019t they do this until now?\u201d</p><br/><p>Crockta smiled as he saw orcs rushing while carrying huge ladders. It felt like the genre of the game had suddenly changed.\u00a0But no matter what the scene was, he had one job.</p><br/><p>He picked up Ogre Slayer.\u00a0Between the successive shocks and arrows, the sound of the ladders couldn\u2019t be heard properly.\u00a0The commanders shouted until their voices were hoarse but were buried by the other loud sounds.</p><br/><p>The orcs started climbing one by one.\u00a0Crockta looked down the wall. Many orcs were stuck like ants. Their mad eyes were only filled with the obsession of completely breaking down the city. There were no signs of fear.</p><br/><p>The chieftain\u2019s madness was contagious.\u00a0However, the dark elves weren\u2019t quiet.\u00a0They poured boiling water, oil, and logs down the ladders, knocking down the orcs. They were all brutal weapons prepared in advance. Orcs were unable to climb the walls and fell in terrible ways.</p><br/><p>\"Vicious bastards.\"</p><br/><p>The orcs stepped on the bodies of their companions and used them as a ladder.\u00a0Crockta wielded Ogre Slayer at those climbing the walls. The orc near the railings had his neck cut and fell to the ground. Several orcs underneath were caught up and also fell.</p><br/><p>Crockta grabbed the ladder.</p><br/><p>\u201cHuaaat!\u201d</p><br/><p>Then he pushed with all his strength. His tattoos burned hot and the tendons on his neck pulsed.</p><br/><p>\u201cKuaaah!\u201d</p><br/><p>The ladder started tilting. The orcs hanging on the ladder fell off and the ladder went in the opposite direction.</p><br/><p>\"Those who have forgotten their honor\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crockta\u2019s battle cry covered all noise on the battlefield. His roar rang in the orcs\u2019 ears.</p><br/><p>\"I will kill you directly\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</p><br/><p>The Orcheim warriors raised their weapons following Crockta\u2019s cry.</p><br/><p>\"Bul\u2019tarrrr!\u201d</p><br/><p>Crockta wielded his weapon. The body of the orc on the railing was chopped in half and flew through the air. Blood spilled from his head and fell on the head of the orcs. Then he kicked an orc grabbing the handrail.\u00a0</p><br/><p>The greatsword was swung and another ladder was broken.\u00a0A stone from a trebuchet headed towards Crockta, who didn\u2019t avoid it.\u00a0Rather, he wielded the greatsword.\u00a0Ogre Slayer smashed against it.\u00a0The huge rock shattered in the air and fell on top of the orcs. Some were hit on the head by the debris.</p><br/><p>His sword was aimed at the orcs.\u00a0His sword was aimed at the rocks.</p><br/><p>The morale of the dark elves on Crockta\u2019s area of the wall rose.</p><br/><p>\u201cKill the invaders!\u201d\u00a0In the east, Caska was commanding the archers. She used her distinctive manner of talking while continuously flying arrows.\u00a0\u201cKill those bastards who want to trample on our home!\u201d</p><br/><p>Arrows flew over the heads of the orcs. They had to blow with weapons or die. The death cries of the orcs resounded.\u00a0Crockta killed the orcs trying to climb onto the walls and looked around.</p><br/><p>The orcs were still advancing.</p><br/><p>\"It will be a long day.\u201d</p><br/><p>He could see Tiyo playing in the distance. Using the characteristics of General\u2019s high-speed shooting, he swept at the orcs approaching the walls. Each time the colorful energy swept over the ladders, a great number of orcs fell.</p><br/><p>It was a tremendous play, but Crockta felt a strange flow in the atmosphere.\u00a0His skill Introduction to Magic and Heart and Soul Penetration were activated, and he started to feel the flow of magic power. Then Tiyo pointed at something.</p><br/><p>\u201cThat...\u201d</p><br/><p>Crockta hurriedly looked around the battlefield. In the back of the army, the orc shamans were gathering together.\u00a0There were five of them and energy was rising from their bodies.\u00a0The magic power was swirling in the sky like a whirlwind. Magic power rushed up to the clouds in the air. It became a huge sphere.</p><br/><p>It looked like the sun. The blinding light coming from it disturbed his eyesight.</p><br/><p>Meteor!</p><br/><p>It wasn\u2019t a real meteorite, but one that fell down like a giant meteor. The blazing magic power started to slowly approach the wall.\u00a0Manifestation magic.</p><br/><p>The dark elves were confused and stopped attacking. Even Crockta also didn\u2019t know what to do.\u00a0This would cause tremendous damage and the walls would completely collapse.</p><br/><p>At that moment, a magic power barrier was unfolded.\u00a0It was a translucent net in the sky. It infinitely expanded. A new net was weaved and then another new one. It doubled and quadrupled until a huge wall covered the entire sky above Spinoa.</p><br/><p>A magnificent voice cried out, \"The net of heaven might look thin, but it will never miss anything.\u201d</p><br/><p>The magician of Nameragon, Jamero.\u00a0He raised his staff and shouted.</p><br/><p>\"None of you will ever see the world tree or Spinoa!\u201d</p><br/><p>A blue light emerged from his staff. At the same time, the barrier of magic power spread in the sky started to vibrate.\u00a0It glowed as the meteor fell on it.\u00a0The two magic powers clashed.</p><br/><p>A loud sound emerged.</p><br/><p>\"......!\"</p><br/><p>Crockta frowned at the tremendous light. The terrible explosive sound seemed to shatter the whole area. Flames exploded and light scattered. He became deaf and confused.\u00a0It was like he was witnessing the end of the world.</p><br/><p>The two magic powers kept bumping back and forth against each other. But Jamero\u2019s magic net kept expanding and pushing back the meteor. The heat gradually faded. The magic power of the shamans broke in a flash of white.</p><br/><p>The meteor turned into white ash in the air.\u00a0It was destroyed.\u00a0It was Jamero\u2019s victory. But he had consumed a lot of power and had to sit down. The dark elves cheered. As morale rose again, their arrows flew through the air. Orcs fell down.</p><br/><p>The march of the orcs started to stall. There were orcs on the walls, but they failed to enter due to the dark elves\u2019 desperate resistance and died.\u00a0They poured oil on the orcs and burned the ladders. Dark smoke rose.</p><br/><p>However, Crockta couldn\u2019t feel relieved.\u00a0Crockta felt a huge presence and looked up.\u00a0He was coming.</p><br/><p>Ogre Slayer was raised.\u00a0A huge shadow covered him. It looked like a rock from the trebuchet, but Crockta knew it was actually an orc.</p><br/><p><em>Kwaang!</em></p><br/><p>The huge orc landed on the wall. He got up. His appearance looked like a giant mountain on the wall.\u00a0Crockta stepped back and all the dark elves escaped from the area at once.\u00a0The mad great chieftain, Calmahart.\u00a0The region of wall where they were standing contained only Crockta and Calmahart.</p><br/><p>\u201cI said I would see you again, Crockta.\u201d\u00a0</p><br/><p>The red eyes glared at Crockta.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Crockta grinned as he replied, \u201cLikewise. You look handsome, Calmahart.\u201d</p><br/><p>There was a scar on his face due to the wound caused by Crockta. Calmahart looked down at him and laughed. It was uglier than before.</p><br/><p>\u201cYou only bite with your mouth. Kuhuhu.\u201d</p><br/><p>Crockta and Calmahart raised their weapons.\u00a0Suddenly, Crockta looked around.</p><br/><p>\u201cWhere is your nanny?\u201d</p><br/><p>\u201cWhat do you mean?\"</p><br/><p>\"The shaman who tells you what to do, just like a nanny looking after a kid.\u201d</p><br/><p>Calmahart\u2019s face stiffened. \u00a0Crockta smiled and provoked Calmahart again, \"Back then, you looked like a well-behaved kid as you backed away with your nanny. Now you\u2019re allowed to charge in here?\u201d</p><br/><p>Flames surged in Calmahart\u2019s eyes.</p><br/><p>\"Shut up\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</p><br/><p>He swung his double edged axe. Crockta avoided it. The bottom of the wall collapsed.\u00a0Crockta gripped Ogre Slayer tightly.</p><br/><p>Things didn\u2019t look good.\u00a0Orcs were climbing up the walls.\u00a0With the emergence of Calmahart, the walls became useless. No one could stop the ladders around him so a few orcs started to climb the walls.\u00a0The orcs ran to the other side and attacked the dark elves.\u00a0The dark elves resisted, but they were no match against the orcs in close combat. The dark elves were starting to collapse. Their bodies fell down the walls. The orcs cheered.</p><br/><p>\"......!\"</p><br/><p>Crockta\u2019s body trembled.\u00a0He wanted to help them but the great chieftain was blocking him.</p><br/><p>\"Where are you looking?\u201d\u00a0Calmahart headed towards Crockta with an emotionless face. Crockta stepped back.</p><br/><p>\u00a0Calmahart spat out in a rough voice, \"Keep talking.\"</p><br/><p>A red haze appeared around his body.\u00a0It was different from their confrontation in Juora. There was a fierce aura as always, but his eyes were calm. He was stronger and cooler.\u00a0If so, the provocation was useless.</p><br/><p>\u201cI apologize,\u201d Crockta replied politely.</p><br/><p>Derision appeared on Calmahart\u2019s face.\u00a0\"Kuhuhu, already frightened...\u201d</p><br/><p>Crockta interrupted his words.\u00a0\"That guy, he wasn\u2019t your nanny, but your mother. Is your mother healthy? Are you still depressed?\u201d</p><br/><p>Calmahart\u2019s face changed.</p><br/><p>\"This trash\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc: Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my Patreon to reflect my new novels.

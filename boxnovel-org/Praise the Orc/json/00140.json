The steel bars were so tightly packed together that it was difficult for Crockta to bend them enough for his body to pass through.\u00a0</span><span>If so, he needed to try another place.\u00a0</span><span>He looked at the walls. The rough surface looked hard, but it might be deceptive. Maybe this wall consisted of easily broken rocks, just like in the movies.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet's see...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta touched his chin.\u00a0</span><span>His escape strategy was simple.\u00a0</span><span>In the moment before they executed him, or the moment they came into the prison to do something to him, he would defeat them with his skills.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta didn\u2019t feel like the situation was very urgent as he didn\u2019t think he would be killed.\u00a0</span><span>But he was bored staying still.\u00a0</span><span>If he was imprisoned, he was tempted to try all methods of escape before eventually gaining his freedom.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t have anything good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was only the bed in the prison. This didn\u2019t seem to be a long-term detention center as there was not even a toilet.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta got up and looked at the legs of the bed. He could use those.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta broke one of the four legs of the bed.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Crunch!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The orc\u2019s large hand grasped it and twisted, breaking the wooden leg. A sharp piece of wood emerged from the broken off section.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta used it to scratch at the wall.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kikikikik.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Kkikikik.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was no change. The finish on the walls was poor but it was still concrete.\u00a0</span><span>His physical means were gone.\u00a0</span><span>The resources in the environment couldn\u2019t help him.\u00a0</span><span>Therefore, he needed to use human-assisted psychological escape.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta approached the steel bars and looked outside. The people had gone away, but they left one guard here.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta called out, \"Hey.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>There was no answer.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta spoke again, \"Hey...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This time, he spoke in a powerless and weary voice. He staged a little bit of fear.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is there nobody...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was the feeling of someone jumping in the distance.\u00a0</span><span>The guard seemed to struggle for a moment before walking to the prison where Crockta was.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta sat down on the bed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What is going on?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>A star on his forehead. Shabby attire. Weak atmosphere.\u00a0</span><span>It was an ordinary user with a low position in the Heaven and Earth Clan.\u00a0</span><span>His back was straight since he was nervous about confronting the famous orc warrior, Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was slumped over in a pathetic manner, in order to meet his expectations.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cExcuse me..really...I\u2019ll be executed...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Moist eyes!\u00a0</span><span>Who would\u2019ve ever thought that he was the brutal orc warrior Crockta, the one who killed the great chieftain in the north and wiped out any opponents!\u00a0</span><span>The man\u2019s face softened as he felt compassion for Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I still have a lot of work left to do...there is also the situation with my gold and treasures...\u201d Crockta muttered to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>His words caught the guard\u2019s interest. The thought of gold and treasure always shook people\u2019s hearts.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhh...I...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta made a distressed sound, making it seem like he was troubled.\u00a0</span><span>His method acting made the guard look at him like he was pathetic.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Hoo.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s expression stiffened before getting up from the bed.</span></p><br/><p><span>A fearsome pressure suddenly surrounded Crockta, causing the guard to step back. There weren\u2019t many people who could endure Crockta\u2019s killing intent. The guard felt his legs trembling.\u00a0</span><span>The moment that he was about to leave due to the sudden change,\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta called out, \u201cPeople die anyway. There is no regret about the path I walked. However, it is shameful that I can\u2019t pass on the orc\u2019s secret sword of justice!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were the eyes of a man ready to die.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked at the guard. He stared blankly at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta said in a loud voice, \"I will soon die by the hands of your leader. I have taken many lives so it isn\u2019t unjust.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The image of a dignified person in front of death was always impressive.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are the last person I will meet! Although you aren\u2019t an orc, I would like to teach you the orc\u2019s secret technique.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The man\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>Anyone who read martial arts novels would know what this was.\u00a0</span><span>A once in a lifetime chance!</span></p><br/><p><span>Furthermore, the orc he was facing wasn\u2019t just any orc.\u00a0</span><span>Anyone familiar with Elder Lord would know about the Righteous Orc Crockta, crushed of users and the one who killed the great chieftain before the giant quest could start.\u00a0</span><span>Wouldn\u2019t it be strange if such an NPC was executed without an event?</span></p><br/><p><span>The guard began to interpret the situation according to his own desires.\u00a0</span><span>That\u2019s right. This was a type of special event or quest.\u00a0</span><span>The orc wanted to pass on everything before he was killed. It was natural for an artificial intelligence to be programmed to pass on their legacy before death.</span></p><br/><p><span>What would be the legacy of a great warrior in the world of Elder Lord?</span></p><br/><p><span>Today, an opportunity came to him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOnly!\"\u00a0</span><span>Crockta struck the player.\u00a0</span><span>By setting conditions, it would let the guard know that this wasn\u2019t easy.\u00a0</span><span>Humans coveted what was difficult.\u00a0</span><span>It might be difficult, but it was the right type of hardship that one could endure.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You must make an oath to pass on this secret technique to another orc. This is a one-man martial art. You can never break this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The guard was already blinded by greedy so this type of condition didn\u2019t matter. Rather, it just added fuel to his desires.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you promise?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI do!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen I will say my name. I am Crockta, \u00a0your mentor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The guard started to paint an image of becoming a ranker, then driving a gorgeous supercar bought with the profits.\u00a0</span><span>Celebrities would want to meet him and everyone would look surprised at his name.\u00a0</span><span>He would become a top-notch player in this world, even better than Rommel, master of the Heaven and Earth Clan.\u00a0</span><span>He would have splendid parties in a nice house and hang around beautiful women. A sweet life that no one could ignore!</span></p><br/><p><span>Now it was time to start a new life as \u2018Ranker Lee Jungmin.\u2019\u00a0</span><span>He shouted, \u201cCrockta! My name is Lee Jungmin!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA nice name. Bow to me and tell the heavens that I will be your master.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at Lee Jungmin bowing.\u00a0</span><span>It was a ritual common in martial arts novels so he didn\u2019t suspect anything. Greed always clouded people\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Lee Jungmin bowed nine times before breathing out roughly.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHeok, heok. It is done, Master.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOkay. Come up to me and bow. I will give you a blessing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Now, the man had no doubts at all. The future of the Heaven and Earth Clan was dark if this was a guard.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Lee Jungmin bowed his head.\u00a0</span><span>\"Please take care of me, Master!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Okay. Come closer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"T-This is as close as possible...\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>If Lee Jungmin moved any further, his head would hit the iron bars. Crockta nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He moved up close to the bars, stretched out a hand, and grabbed the guard\u2019s neck.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Cough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Lee Jungmin struggled as he was raised in the air.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta laughed cruelly, \u201cStupid person! It is so easy to fool you! You have a walnut in your head, not a brain!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Y-You, l-lie....! Keok...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are the one who was deceived. Anyway, life is a stage for liars so you should always stay calm and keep an eye on the truth. Stupid guy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Lee Jungmin\u2019s consciousness gradually faded away.\u00a0</span><span>\"T-Treating me like this...you will regret...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta twisted Lee Jungmin\u2019s neck more brutally.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHow will I regret it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Keok...keok...hoo...hal...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Lee Jungmin completely collapsed.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grabbed the bunch of keys hanging from his waist and threw the body roughly on the ground. The body started turning into white particles.\u00a0</span><span>The dead were silent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhu, regret it elsewhere.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta admired his acting skills as he placed the key in the lock of the door.\u00a0</span><span>The door was opened.\u00a0</span><span>He escaped.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuhahaha, kuhahahat! Who else can trap me?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He grinned as he looked at the last particles of Lee Jungmin.\u00a0</span><span>\"Not Lee Jungmin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Lee Jungmin\u2019s poor heart. He had been overwhelmed by all the dreams pushed in front of him.\u00a0</span><span>However, such hope also drove people to move towards the future.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta had used method acting to escape from this terrible prison.\u00a0</span><span>If he hadn\u2019t tried to escape like this, he would\u2019ve spent a few depressing hours trapped. It would\u2019ve definitely been a horrible time.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta opened his arms and closed his eyes. He enjoyed the freedom with his whole body as he muttered a line from a movie he loved.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hope is a good thing. The most precious thing. And good things will never disappear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He recalled Lee Jungmin\u2019s final warning that he would regret this.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta laughed as he headed outside the prison.\u00a0</span><span>Then his feet twisted in a strange way and his nose struck the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeook!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Blood flowed down from his nose. He got up from the floor while pressing a hand against his pained nose.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grabbed it and whined.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is strange.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>There weren\u2019t many instances where he lost his balance.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>It happened when Crockta, who had been moving for a while, was walking through the outer passage of the prison.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuak!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>A torch hanging on a wall suddenly fell and hit his foot. The fire was scattered.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta held one foot and jumped while putting out the fire, as his face twisted from the pain.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is this...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta couldn\u2019t see because he had shut his eyes in pain and slammed his head into the wall.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuak!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He fell down.\u00a0</span><span>Why were all these ridiculous things happening? A coincidence?\u00a0</span><span>Crockta, who was caught in a strange situation, closed his eyes and decided to breathe. He held down the pain and muttered an apology to Lee Jungmin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cS-Sorry...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta slowly raised his body. As he continued walking, he saw a table with some items on it.\u00a0</span><span>His beloved Ogre Slayer was seen. Crockta placed it in the sheath on his back.\u00a0</span><span>Edgar had done something wrong, so Crockta didn\u2019t feel ashamed at all, except for the poor guard who was killed by him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta started running along the corridor.\u00a0</span><span>Now there was nothing to stop him.\u00a0</span><span>Edgar pretended to be cool and rational, but it was time to squeeze the whiner out of him.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is this </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were watching Maillard.</span></p><br/><p><span>Mailliard\u2019s specialty was the \u2018Coin Fountain\u2019 in the main square. There was a saying that throwing a coin in here would cause a wish to come true, so the fountain sparkled with the shine of the coins thrown in by citizens and visitors.\u00a0</span><span>The gold coins were gathered and used to help the people at the temple.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a signpost in front of the Coin Fountain.</span></p><br/><p><span>[This tradition was made by Orc Warrior Crockta. He captured three wicked people disturbing Maillard and said to them, \u2018This isn\u2019t just a fountain, but a means to help the poor.\u2019 The three disciples went out and comforted citizens in the daily lives, helped those in trouble...(Omitted)]</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...This Crockta isn\u2019t our Crockta right </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAish, surely not.

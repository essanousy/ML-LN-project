Nevertheless, there were those who missed the past and lamented that things weren\u2019t the same.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the same for Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>He headed towards the \u2018Where are my Brothers?\u2019 pub.\u00a0</span><span>At the entrance, there was a refreshing smell that he hadn\u2019t expected to exist: a feminine perfume scent mixed with flowers and citrus. The sharpness of the scent\u2019s top notes pierced his nose.\u00a0</span><span>Clear laughter surrounded him as he entered the pub.</span></p><br/><p><span>The waitress approached and welcomed, \u201cHello, how can I help you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his head.\u00a0</span><span>A young and fresh girl.\u00a0</span><span>The menu had all types of dishes nearly listed.\u00a0</span><span>There were sets available for a large group of people. There were also couple sets. In the midst of this confusion, Crockta could only gaze desperately at the menu.</span></p><br/><p><span>This wasn\u2019t an illusion.\u00a0</span><span>He knew this was the place.\u00a0</span><span>This was the \u2018Where are my Brothers?\u2019 pub.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta forcibly opened his mouth and spoke without checking the menu.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Cream spaghetti.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The expression of the employee didn\u2019t change.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...And chopsticks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a bright smile.\u00a0</span><span>She replied \u2018Yes\u2019 in a cheerful voice and left.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his head.\u00a0</span><span>Nobody was laughing at him.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta sank wearily into the chair.\u00a0</span><span>At the next table, a man and woman burst out laughing. Behind him were some youths that were whispering together.</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t know where to look.\u00a0</span><span>It was confusing rather than shameful.\u00a0</span><span>He felt a mixed sense of insult and betrayal.\u00a0</span><span>This was the \u2018Where are my Brothers?\u2019 pub; but it had now turned into a fusion pub with a bright atmosphere that was aimed at young people.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHere is your cream spaghetti. Please enjoy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta accepted the plate of cream spaghetti with chopsticks nearly arranged on the table.\u00a0</span><span>There was even a mat to place the chopsticks.\u00a0</span><span>But what now?\u00a0</span><span>He placed the chopsticks in the cream spaghetti like he was holding a knife.\u00a0</span><span>The noodles were like the enemies.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta ate the cream spaghetti.\u00a0</span><span>It was delicious, causing him to became sadder.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018An orc ordering cream spaghetti... This isn\u2019t a comedy!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his head. He looked around but didn\u2019t see the owner of the voice.\u00a0</span><span>It was a hallucination.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Isn\u2019t that a dish for girls? Kukukuk...\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He continued using his chopsticks as the suppressed memories rose.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Will he also order strawberry juice and a kiwi parfait? Kelkelkel...!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>These voices were only heard in his head.\u00a0</span><span>Instead, silly conversations such as \u2018Cream spaghetti is delicious,\u2019 \u2018Shall we eat?\u2019 and \u2018Is there a menu like that?\u2019 entered his ears.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018The old fields are overgrown with barley, and they were are rich in rice stalks and millets.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta thought with longing as he chewed on his cream spaghetti.\u00a0</span><span>Then he drew an inverted triangle with the last piece of cream spaghetti.\u00a0</span><span>He waited.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey, Orc.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>It was the voice from his memories. Crockta got up from his spot.\u00a0</span><span>It was the owner of the \u2018Where are my Brothers?\u2019 and the head of the Information Guild\u2019s branch in Maillard.</span></p><br/><p><span>That man.</span></p><br/><p><span>The two didn\u2019t greet each other. Crockta wanted to blame him, but couldn\u2019t open his mouth because of the deep look in the owner\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span>He could tell that they shared the same feelings.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Come here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He guided Crockta to another place.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The interior of the pub was changed, but the secret passage was still there.\u00a0</span><span>They walked through a door and entered the basement.\u00a0</span><span>There was a table in the room and it gave off the feeling of an interrogation room.</span></p><br/><p><span>The two sat facing each other.\u00a0</span><span>Back here, there were no differences.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You have become big. It hasn\u2019t been so long since I\u2019ve seen you,\u201d the owner said with a mock bow. </span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta replied in a profound manner, \"It has been a long time, long enough for things to change.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man laughed bitterly. Then he changed the topic.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, well, didn\u2019t you come because of the Thawing Balhae Clan? A group of those who have been cursed by the stars. In the meantime, I\u2019ve gained enough information. Northern Conqueror Crockta who rebuilt the north.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A divine message came down to the temples. All the gods whispered your name. Crossing the northern limit line, conquering the north and preventing a terrible war. The hero of the north who killed the crazy chieftain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded. There would be more gods on the continent apart from the grey god, the world tree or the \u2018Tribulation\u2019 that he killed.\u00a0</span><span>The system messages for users were regarded as divine messages for the inhabitants of Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man pulled out some information.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta read through the contents in turn.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was as expected. The Thawing Balhae members had joined the Heaven and Earth Clan. The Thawing Balhae\u2019s clan leader and Grom, no Hyunchul. He had the new name \u2018Luin\u2019 and was part of the Heaven and Earth Clan.\u00a0</span><span>They combined their abilities with the combat capabilities of \u2018Rommel\u2019 Choi Hansung, the so-called genius of war.\u00a0</span><span>In the land of the south, he was in touch with the nobles and planning more wars.</span></p><br/><p><span>Indeed, the Information Guild had gathered a lot of information while he was in the north.\u00a0</span><span>There weren\u2019t only one or two documents. There were several hypothetical scenarios of what they would do in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Too bad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man looked up at Crockta\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span>\"Sorry, is it not enough? It isn\u2019t easy to obtain such information.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about the information. The information is excellent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man was silent.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta wasn\u2019t talking about the information. The man knew very well what Crockta was talking about.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The transaction will continue in the future. Thanks for the information.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...You\u2019re welcome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They got up from their seats.\u00a0</span><span>The Information Guild\u2019s branch manager touched his chin and called out to Crockta again.\u00a0</span><span>\"Wait. I have one more thing.\"\u00a0</span><span>He placed his hand back in the small hole in the wall. It was the hole where the guild members handed him the materials.\u00a0</span><span>Then he handed new documents to Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is a gift.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA gift?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A gift for the orc warrior who saved the continent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta received the papers.\u00a0</span><span>It was a single document with the tag \u2018Uncertain\u2019 on it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Uncertain data shouldn\u2019t be distributed, but I will show you this specifically. It still isn\u2019t clear but I thought you should know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes widened. The information was shocking.\u00a0</span><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan was preparing for a larger war after sweeping through the north.\u00a0</span><span>And their goal...</span></p><br/><p><span>It was all the orcs on the continent, including Orcrox.\u00a0</span><span>The current relationship between humans and orcs weren\u2019t good. The reason he chose the greatsword, the greatsword master Leyteno had fought for the orcs in the war, and the remnants of that war still remained.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now the uncomfortable relationship was like a tradition.\u00a0</span><span>They were planning to drive a wedge between the two species to create a bigger war. It wasn\u2019t enough to kill Lenox, they wanted to trample on the rest of the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was just a \u2018quest\u2019 and \u2018game content\u2019 to them.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Crunch.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Crockta gritted his teeth.\u00a0</span><span>There were more reasons to crush them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thank you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The owner extended his hand. Crockta shook it.\u00a0</span><span>The two of them exchanged a look and came up to the pub.</span></p><br/><p><span>Once again, it was an unfamiliar landscape.\u00a0</span><span>This was the \u2018Where are my Brothers?\u2019 pub that was a front for the Information Guild. But now, it had surpassed its purpose of simple camouflage.\u00a0</span><span>In times where business was becoming increasingly difficult, the Information Guild had to renovate while thinking of profit. The pub was now a business, not a camouflage.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a decision barely made after some suffering.\u00a0</span><span>He knew it with his head.\u00a0</span><span>Nevertheless, Crockta couldn\u2019t help feeling regret.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...The pub has changed a lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt can't be helped. The deficit would\u2019ve continued otherwise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at the flirtatious couples and the young men and women whispering together, and admitted that times had changed.\u00a0</span><span>It had become too perky.\u00a0</span><span>The males full of masculinity would be long gone.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked at the owner of the Information Guild with sad eyes.\u00a0</span><span>\"A roasted pig, is it possible to get that here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I would like to eat a whole roasted pig...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The owner\u2019s eyes widened. He dropped his head like he couldn\u2019t bear looking at Crockta anymore.\u00a0</span><span>He hesitated a moment before barely opening his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat menu...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He smiled and continued speaking.\u00a0</span><span>\"I don't have that dish anymore.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Times had changed.\u00a0</span><span>The stories of the real men who ridiculed cream spaghetti, hated fruit juice, and chewed on big pieces of meat were over.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\"I will have whiskey. A bottle please.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The owner handed over the whiskey.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta paid the price and opened the lid.\u00a0</span><span>He took a sip straight from the bottle of whiskey.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Heol, look at that person...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oh my, what is this? That orc?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He is drinking from the bottle. Aiyah. Isn\u2019t that a strong whiskey?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Amazing, amazing!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>These young ones.\u00a0</span><span>In the past, there was a time when one would be teased if they didn\u2019t do this.\u00a0</span><span>It was the era of real males.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta started moving. He headed towards the exit of the \u2018Where are my Brothers?\u2019 pub.\u00a0</span><span>Looking at the bright faces of the couples coming in, Crockta thought this wasn\u2019t too bad either.\u00a0</span><span>The men and women smiled as they looked at each other.\u00a0</span><span>There was obvious affection in their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was also good.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grabbed the door.\u00a0</span><span>He pushed at the cold handle. The door closed behind him.\u00a0</span><span>He walked away from the \u2018Where are my Brothers?\u2019 pub.\u00a0</span><span>A gust of wind blew through the streets of Maillard and past him.</span></p><br/><p><span>He suddenly turned his head.\u00a0</span><span>He could see the scenery of Maillard. The lights shining, the drunkards on the streets, people heading home to prepare for a lively day tomorrow.\u00a0</span><span>Somewhere out there, the men would still be living their lives.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere is no need for regrets\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Where are my Brothers?\u2019 might\u2019ve turned into a lively fusion bar but their place in Maillard hadn\u2019t completely disappeared.\u00a0</span><span>Somewhere in \u00a0Maillard, the manly men would still be moving.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am just a little sad.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta raised the whiskey bottle. He didn\u2019t drink from it.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta tilted it.\u00a0</span><span>The whiskey poured out onto the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"For the real men who aren\u2019t here anymore.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He poured out all of the whiskey.\u00a0</span><span>A tribute to the past.\u00a0</span><span>He recalled the beautiful time and the manly men.</span></p><br/><p><span>He drank towards a bygone era.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

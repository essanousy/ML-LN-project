Common grade meant one was around the ordinary level, while Uncommon was better even better than that.\u00a0</span><span>After Uncommon was Special, and then after that was the Rare rank. Following Rare, the current highest known rank, was Essence. \u00a0It meant literally realizing the essence of the skill.</span></p><br/><p><span>Among the famous rankers of Elder Lord, Choi Hansung\u2019s skill, \u2018Battlefield Penetrating Eyes\u2019, was revealed to be at the Essence grade.</span></p><br/><p><span>Most of the user\u2019s skills were Common, Uncommon, or the occasional Special grade skills.\u00a0</span><span>Elder Lord resembled reality. Everyone\u2019s abilities were different, and it wasn\u2019t easy for a user to reach a level beyond Special. Therefore, most of them were enthusiastic about gathering as many skills as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you believe in your abilities?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI believe in them to a certain extent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian replied.</span></p><br/><p><span>He learned martial arts. In other words, he was unusually strong. Of course, he trained hard, but it wasn\u2019t like his colleagues didn\u2019t work hard either. Ian knew that he had a talent for violence.\u00a0</span><span>Talented people would feel like they were talented.</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Certainly, you have talent. However, keep in mind that talent isn\u2019t the only thing needed to become strong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you talking about effort?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I think that the word effort is too light.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Obsession.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We can be anything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t want to, but he acknowledged it.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t strange to call it a type of power.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian had lived in poverty, and his parents\u2019 business hadn\u2019t been good in his childhood. After his parents died, he inherited their debt and headed to the battlefield to make money. It was a harsh life that he could never boast about to anyone else.</span></p><br/><p><span>He killed and killed again.\u00a0</span><span>It was all for the sake of money.\u00a0</span><span>The targets weren\u2019t always evil.</span></p><br/><p><span>Therefore, if he acknowledged Hoyt, he would have to blame himself for choosing life on the battlefield without trying any other ways. Indeed, such guilt tormented his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian continued, \"Not everyone can do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Everyone...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt smiled and aimed his hammer at Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am not talking to everyone right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am talking to you right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at him. Hoyt\u2019s body, full of battle scars and tattoos, was proof of his experience over the past years.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you a common person?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you want to be a warrior?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I want to be one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Everyone... If you are like everyone else, then you can\u2019t be a warrior. A warrior has to go on a path that no one else has traveled before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt moved back and raised the hammer with both of his hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLook closely.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt took a deep breath.\u00a0</span><span>Ian flinched. The atmosphere seemed to be shaking, and he could feel something coming from Hoyt\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><span>Strength, it wasn\u2019t the same as energy.\u00a0</span><span>Rather, it was the opposite. As a result, Hoyt\u2019s presence became blurred.\u00a0</span><span>He was becoming a part of this world.\u00a0</span><span>Then again, he became separate from the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt moved his hammer.\u00a0</span><span>It was a slow motion. However, Ian witnessed the world moving in reverse.\u00a0</span><span>The world broke with the simple movements of the hammer.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian wanted to sit down, as he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>This, this was the pinnacle state that Baek Hanho said Ian was unlikely to reach in his lifetime.\u00a0</span><span>This was the domain of the ancient military arts.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was short, but seemed to last for an eternity. Hoyt raised his hammer and restored his breathing. He looked at Ian and smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Did you see?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I was hoping so, but you really are amazing to see it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt put down his hammer. Sweat rolled down his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"When I was your age, there was a really talented orc. I was stupid compared to him. Something that he took one try to learn would take me 20 or 30 attempts.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoyt....?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right. He really was a genius. He would make an instant judgement and rush at the opponent with marvelous skill. He had a brilliant wit that I could never reach in my lifetime. So, I desperately asked the instructor. What could I do to become stronger?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt raised the hand at his waist. Ian handed him a towel.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The instructor showed me a number of ways to wield the weapon. And that was enough. I didn\u2019t need to know anything else, he said.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the early stages of the pinnacle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I believed him and repeated his actions like crazy. People laughed at me like it was ridiculous, but I didn\u2019t give up. I worked constantly without compromise. 10,000 times, 100,000 times, and more. Then at some point, I became a warrior.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at his sword.\u00a0</span><span>He could do the same.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You definitely have talent,\" Hoyt said.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is why I am saying this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Go towards the pinnacle, and beyond me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian's martial arts were stagnant.\u00a0</span><span>It had undergone further development on the battlefield, but was blocked again by a wall. He couldn\u2019t go beyond that. Ian inwardly acknowledged his limits.\u00a0</span><span>But today, he saw beyond it.\u00a0</span><span>It was inside a game.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Congratulations! You have witnessed a Pinnacle grade skill.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[You feel thrilled by the high level of martial arts and the reality of the Pinnacle grade skill!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[A Pinnacle grade skill is only achieved by the real powerhouses in the world of Elder Lord.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[The title \u2018Person Pursuing the Pinnacle\u2019 has been acquired. All skills will gain proficiency until they reach the Pinnacle grade.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[You have acquired the Mind\u2019s Eye (Special) skill that allows you to understand the reality of the target.]</span></p><br/><p><span><span>[One <span id=\"footnote-50\">achievement point has been acquired.]</span></span></span></p><br/><p><span>[Your level has risen.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Status Window]</span></p><br/><p><span>'Person Pursuing the Pinnacle\u2019 Ian, Orc Apprentice Warrior</span></p><br/><p><span>Level: 7</span></p><br/><p><span>Achievement Points: 380</span></p><br/><p><span>Assimilation: 57%</span></p><br/><p><span>Abilities:\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Orc's Superhuman Strength (Uncommon)</span></p><br/><p><span>Orc's Vitality (Uncommon)</span></p><br/><p><span>Orc\u2019s Greatsword Technique (Uncommon)</span></p><br/><p><span>Warrior's Fighting Spirit (Uncommon)</span></p><br/><p><span>Mind's Eye (Special)</span></p><br/><p><span>The messages popped up, but Ian shook his head. Those things didn\u2019t matter right now.</span></p><br/><p><span>His heart pounded.\u00a0</span><span>He wanted to swing his sword. He wanted to move his body. Not just in the game, but in reality as well.\u00a0</span><span>Ian still couldn\u2019t believe that he saw it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It\u2019s hard since it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve done it in quite a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is really wonderful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are even more amazing. You don\u2019t seem like an apprentice, since even some of the best warriors would only see a common swing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt looked at the sun.\u00a0</span><span>He had the ability to calculate the approximate time according to the location of the sun, a skill that Ian didn\u2019t have.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It\u2019s time for Ray to finish.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian said, \"I\u2019ll go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPlease.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian started moving.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ray, the oldest of Thompson\u2019s children, was attending school. It wasn\u2019t a regular training curriculum provided by the government like in Ian\u2019s reality, but a private institute run by various intellectual scholars. Thompson believed that his children should be in school, regardless of his economic situation.\u00a0</span><span>It was an educational facility that the guards of Anail protected, so Derek couldn\u2019t reach it with his hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian headed towards the school.\u00a0</span><span>It had been a few days, so the people of Anail were used to seeing orcs. Some people of different species greeted Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Uh, aren\u2019t you selling vegetables now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was a part-time job.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Too bad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Stella is still selling fresh vegetables.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I can\u2019t trust that girl.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The reputation system!\u00a0</span><span>Reputation existed in Elder Lord. Ian became known in Anail through positive activities, such as selling vegetables and protecting the Thompson family from the vicious loan shark.\u00a0</span><span>The attitudes of the NPCs changed from what they were before. They didn\u2019t discriminate against orcs any longer..</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian entered Ray\u2019s school with light footsteps.\u00a0</span><span>However, the atmosphere was weird.\u00a0</span><span>The children were forming a circle around something. This was the scene of a typical kid\u2019s fight.\u00a0</span><span>There was a familiar face inside.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ray.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian watched closely without interrupting. Ray and another child were tangled together as they rolled across the ground. Fists were aimed at the other person.\u00a0</span><span>Ian touched the shoulder of a child watching on the outside.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Who...heok?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The child\u2019s face turned pale as he was faced with the rugged face of an orc.\u00a0</span><span>Ian asked quietly, \u201cWhy are they fighting?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That...Robin teased Ray and said that his dad had run away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hmm...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Ray was pretty tough. Even though it was an even fight, Ray soon overpowered Robin. He got on top of Robin and swung his fist.\u00a0</span><span>Robin covered his face with his arms. Ray\u2019s fist hit the guard.</span></p><br/><p><span>At this moment, Ian interrupted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Stop, stop.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The children separated like the how the Sea split for Moses after hearing the orc\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span>Ray also stopped moving.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You shouldn\u2019t fight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian pulled them apart. Ray released Robin and started panting, while Robin stepped back with a nosebleed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you say it one more time, then I\u2019ll kill you,\u201d Ray declared, his eyes filled with hate.\u00a0</span><span>That Robin bastard hadn\u2019t died.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right, your dad isn\u2019t here right now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This bastard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian stopped Ray, who shook his head as he was grabbed by Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMister! That asshole, look at what he is saying! I\u2019ll kill him!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian was stumped.\u00a0</span><span>When he was a child, he beat someone up for cursing at his family. Ian couldn\u2019t say to not use violence because he understood Ray.\u00a0</span><span>In addition, this was Elder Lord, where fists were close to being the law, unlike in the real world. It wasn\u2019t an ideal story. In the end, humans had to learn how to survive on their own in this world.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian just shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is done, so let\u2019s stop here. You don\u2019t want to fight anymore, do you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ray was still enthusiastic, but Robin didn\u2019t want to fight any longer. He wiped his bloody nose with his sleeve.\u00a0</span><span>Ian dispersed the children.</span></p><br/><p><span>He took Ray and started heading back home. Ian had raised Yiyu, but she didn\u2019t experience this situation because she was a girl. She would just quarrel with her friends and then they would make up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Mister, I want to become stronger by learning the sword like you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If I get stronger, then I can kill those guys.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian chuckled in a low voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you want to kill them?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t that too much?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am angry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You can\u2019t kill a person just because you don\u2019t like them, Ray.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is always someone stronger than you. Then what if that person appears and kills a person you care about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then I will die fighting them, like a man.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at Ray. Ray avoided his gaze as if he knew what Ian was thinking.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That isn\u2019t a manly thing to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRay. It is easy to speak about death.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian patted the head of the silent Ray.\u00a0</span><span>He seemed more suited to the world of Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>He received a secret killing technique from Baek Hanho and survived on the battlefield. These things had no place in the real world.\u00a0</span><span>He might run a cafe that made coffee, but he knew more about fighting and killing, life and death, than anyone else.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian scratched his head. His mind was complicated.\u00a0</span><span>At that time, some people appeared and surrounded Ian and Ray.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHello Orc, we meet again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This face. It was one of Derek\u2019s underlings who broke into Thompson\u2019s house.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That monster isn\u2019t here this time, so won\u2019t it be different?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>All of them were holding weapons. Their purpose was obvious, even to a blind man.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian placed Ray behind him and grabbed his sword handle. He measured their power. If they were his opponents, then he would be able to get away with Ray somehow.</span></p><br/><p><span>But there was a man watching from the rear.\u00a0</span><span>A middle-aged man with a beard looked at Ian with a bored face. He wore expensive clothing and held a sword.\u00a0</span><span>An bright aura shone around the sharp blade.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you a friend of Hoyt...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A low and hoarse voice emerged from the man. He stepped forward.\u00a0</span><span>A strong force was emitted from his whole body. Ian was nervous.</span></p><br/><p><span>Strong.\u00a0</span><span>Clearly stronger than Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am Derek, Young Man.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian gathered his strength as he listened. He had to hang in there. Looking at Derek\u2019s nonchalant face, Ian felt like an egg before an approaching knife. His entire body was ready. Derek approached.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe interest...I will have you pay for it with your body.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc: Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule: \u00a0Next Patreon goal reached!!

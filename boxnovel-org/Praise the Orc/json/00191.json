Therefore, the young chicks already reached the chest of an adult human.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was perplexed as the young chicks with beautiful feathers looked up at them with clear eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere are young thunderbirds.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Cute </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were similar in height to Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>As Tiyo approached, the thunderbirds looked at him and made a curious sound. Tiyo cried out when he was lifted up by one chick.\u00a0</span><span>The other thunderbird chick beside it rubbed its beak against Tiyo with a pure appearance of no hostility.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUh?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo suddenly flinched. Blood flowed from the beak and stained Tiyo\u2019s clothing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt seems like they just ate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus pointed to one side.\u00a0</span><span>There were the bodies of monsters such as ogres and trolls, as well as the stolen drake. The bodies were torn in places.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is why the hunting cycle was sped up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There were 10 chicks. They were currently smaller than an adult, but they would soon grow to the size of the mother thunderbird, requiring a huge amount of food.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen the thunderbird is fighting the ogres because of her chicks</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I guess so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The thunderbird took risks in hunting and fighting the ogres head on in order to protect her young.\u00a0</span><span>The chicks didn\u2019t know about their mother\u2019s efforts as they approached the strange visitors and poked them with their beaks.\u00a0</span><span>As Crockta stroked a chick\u2019s head, it spread open its wings and rubbed its body against his legs. They were very friendly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThunderbirds live for 1,000 years,\u201d said Zankus as he gazed at a young thunderbird.\u00a0</span><span>\"In addition, the eggs of a thunderbird needs a very long time to hatch. Thunderbirds keep their eggs in a safe and warm place, waiting a long time until they are hatched.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Zankus began to laugh.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta, Tiyo, and the young thunderbirds stared at him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I followed the thunderbird in order to surpass Shakan. But I once again realize what a great hunter he was.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus pointed to the entrance of the thunderbird nest.\u00a0</span><span>It was a place they hadn\u2019t looked at.\u00a0</span><span>As the sun got lower, sunlight poured into the nest. \u00a0At the same time, shapes appeared on the rock wall near the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were letters.\u00a0</span><span>Someone had carved letters on the rock.\u00a0</span><span>It had been weathered over the years, but the words could still be recognized. Crockta and Tiyo realized who it was.\u00a0</span><span>The traces of a man they could never forget.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I am a descendant of the Shakan and an unnamed hunter. I leave this here for the hunters of the next generation.\u00a0</span><span>A true hunter never hunts the young. Thunderbirds live for 1,000 years and have to wait 100 years for their eggs to hatch.</span></p><br/><p><span>Just the fact that you came here means you have succeeded in hunting the thunderbird. These rare birds shouldn\u2019t be extinguished from history. We hunters should turn away.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan hadn\u2019t failed in hunting the thunderbird.\u00a0</span><span>He knew that the thunderbird was guarding the eggs and turned away without any regrets.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t just Shakan.\u00a0</span><span>Other marks were seen under the sentence left by Shakan.</span></p><br/><p><span>[I am Prairie Hunter Abudai. I respect Shakan\u2019s will.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[I am the dark elf Hikade. Please let the mother mother bird see the fruits of her labor.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[I am Albulla, the world\u2019s strongest hunter! Today I will show mercy.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[I miss my wife and children. Hunter Joffrey, I will finish my hunting and return home.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Wow There are 12 eggs. Take care of your children well, Thunderbird! Hunter William.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Since then, several hunters had come to this point, leaving their mark before turning away.\u00a0</span><span>A rare species hardly ever seen on the continent, the thunderbird with beautiful dark blue wings.\u00a0</span><span>Other hunters reached this point, but they stopped hunting to honor Shakan\u2019s will and to protect the mother and her eggs.</span></p><br/><p><span>The words they left on the rock were shining brightly in the sunlight.\u00a0</span><span>Shakan\u2019s words were getting weathered, but the traces of the other hunters were clear.\u00a0</span><span>Some were great hunters that Zankus knew about.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The way they came here is different, but the point they reached is the same.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The best hunters who had the ability to break through the great forest and reach the thunderbird\u2019s nest.\u00a0</span><span>They all felt the same thing here.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus met Crockta and Tiyo\u2019s gaze as they knew what they had to do now.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhu, I actually liked the thunderbird from the beginning </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Your muzzle was aiming at it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is a type of greeting </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They separated from the chicks clinging to them and left the thunderbird\u2019s nest.\u00a0</span><span>The cries of the thunderbird could be heard from below.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s group climbed down the rock wall without a hitch.\u00a0</span><span>The thunderbird was flying into the sky and dropping ogres, while fighting the ogre wizard as well.\u00a0</span><span>Many feathers had fallen and blood was flowing down.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grabbed God Slayer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'm sorry for the ogres.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He measured the distance. He targeted an enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Bul\u2019tarrrr!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta jumped off the rock without hesitation.\u00a0</span><span>God Slayer descended on the ogre.\u00a0</span><span>Flesh scattered.\u00a0</span><span>Ogre Slayer was now God Slayer. Even an ogre was a light opponent for God Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>If he caught a chicken with the blade, the poor chicken would be shattered.</span></p><br/><p><span>God Slayer struck and the ogre died with a gruesome scream.\u00a0</span><span>The ogre wizard was confused and recoiled from the enemies that appeared above.\u00a0</span><span>At that time, a giant spear flew and skewered the ogres near the ogre wizard.</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogres shrieked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuwaaaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Zankus\u2019 arrow.\u00a0</span><span>Once the ogres stopped, the suffering thunderbird rose up in the sky. She\u00a0</span><span>was bewildered by Crockta\u2019s group suddenly helping her.</span></p><br/><p><span>There were dozens of ogres. However, Crockta, Tiyo, and Zankus defeated them without a hitch.\u00a0</span><span>The golden blade shone and huge arrows bombarded them. The magic bullets flying from Tiyo obstructed any ogres that dared to attack.</span></p><br/><p><span>The thunderbird also descended and started attacking the ogres again. She clawed at an ogre aiming at Crockta\u2019s back. Crockta raised his thumbs in thanks, causing the thunderbird to flap her wings.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuwaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUwoooo!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogres screamed at each other once the situation suddenly changed.\u00a0</span><span>Then there was a roar from the ogre wizard.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuaaaaaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They didn\u2019t know what it meant, but it sounded like a retreat order. The ogre showed their backs and started to run away.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta put away his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>The ogres disappeared without looking back.\u00a0</span><span>It was a quick retreat that made it hard to believe a terrible battle had just taken place. The noise of battle disappeared as calmness once again blanketed the great forest.\u00a0</span><span>Only the corpses of the ogres were scattered all over the place.</span></p><br/><p><span>The thunderbird slowly landed on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKkiiiik...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The thunderbird looked even more beautiful up close.\u00a0</span><span>As if she understood them, she stared at Crockta\u2019s group with clear eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus approached the thunderbird. The thunderbird lowered her head. The two looked at each other for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus reached out his hand.\u00a0</span><span>The thunderbird extended its beak. Zankus stroked the beak. There were scars and blood from the battle. The thunderbird\u2019s beak gently touched Zankus\u2019 body.\u00a0</span><span>Both of them had a rapport after confirming there was no hostility towards each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>The thunderbird lowered her body. Then she made a sound.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t know what it meant at first, but then realized she was telling him to get on her back.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus climbed onto the thunderbird first. Crockta and Tiyo followed. Although their posture was unstable, Zankus grabbed the thunderbird\u2019s neck, Crockta held Zankus and Tiyo held Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKkiiik!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The thunderbird took off.\u00a0</span><span>The earth became far away in an instant.\u00a0</span><span>The thunderbird circled around her nest.\u00a0</span><span>Everything in the great forest seemed like a toy.\u00a0</span><span>The fighting creatures, the resting creatures, the small birds, everything was below them.</span></p><br/><p><span>The afternoon sun was falling.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta enjoyed the air rushing past his body as he gazed at the endless green landscape stretching out before him.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was here.\u00a0</span><span>He lived in the world of Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They enjoyed the scenery for a while. Was the thunderbird always seeing such sights?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Beautiful </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I completely agree.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The thunderbird flapped her wings, as if in agreement.\u00a0</span><span>The thunderbird descended.\u00a0</span><span>They landed at the thunderbird\u2019s nest.\u00a0</span><span>The chicks appeared to welcome their mother. They jumped clumsily at their mother. The thunderbird spread her wings and covered all of her chicks.</span></p><br/><p><span>From their positions, Crockta\u2019s group could see the blood and scars on the thunderbird\u2019s back and wings.\u00a0</span><span>The chicks didn\u2019t know.\u00a0</span><span>How hard the mother thunderbird\u2019s day was today.\u00a0</span><span>How she found food for them and rescued them.\u00a0</span><span>The bodies outside were living their lives until yesterday.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta turned and looked outside.\u00a0</span><span>The sun was setting. It was a beautiful twilight.\u00a0</span><span>Looking at this magnificent sight, Crockta thought that the world was too big.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone was living desperately in it.\u00a0</span><span>They had their own unique lives.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo stood next to Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Today has passed </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The glow of the sunlight reached this place. The rock wall at the entrance of the nest shone.\u00a0</span><span>It made the traces of Shakan and the other hunters who came here more prominent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere is an empty spot.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zankus said. Then he approached the rock.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHow about it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo smiled and nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus pulled out an arrow.\u00a0</span><span>Shakan\u2019s traces, and those of the hunters after him.\u00a0</span><span>He placed the arrowhead on it.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus moved his hand. He started to carve deep and sharp letters.</span></p><br/><p><span>[In honor of the greatest hunter, Shakan.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Hunter Zankus.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Then his hand stopped moving. Crockta received the arrow next. He took it and wrote,</span></p><br/><p><span>[Warrior Crockta.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Then it was Tiyo\u2019s turn.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Manly Tiyo.]</span></p><br/><p><span>The three of them laughed heartily at the sight.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Rustle.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>They reacted to the sudden sound.\u00a0</span><span>Then a brown hand appeared at the entrance of the nest.\u00a0</span><span>The hand shook for a moment before another hand appeared. The owner of the hand slowly pulled himself up.\u00a0</span><span>It was dangerous but he eventually reached the nest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPant...pant...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The bone sparrow on his head cried out awkwardly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Chirpppppppp....\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Anor.\u00a0</span><span>He had been walking here while they fought the ogres and enjoyed the stunning scenery from the thunderbird\u2019s back.\u00a0</span><span>He could barely move at this point.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPant...pant...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor flopped down.

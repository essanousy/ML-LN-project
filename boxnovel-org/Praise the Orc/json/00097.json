Vigor started to return to Nameragon and citizens reappeared on the deserted streets and in the plaza.\u00a0</span><span>Their response was surprisingly lackadaisical.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat? I told you that Radet was going to fix it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Radet is mayor, so how could Aden overthrow him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The garrison suffered, truly suffered.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Nameragon started to return to its ordinary routine.</span></p><br/><p><span>It would\u2019ve been a dangerous situation without Crockta\u2019s group, but the citizens firmly believed in Radet. It was clear how much faith he normally gave.\u00a0</span><span>Radet went around Nameragon to thank the citizens and stabilize the public.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Citizens! Thank you! Thanks to your calm actions, we were able to finish the situation quickly. Hahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hey, thank you, Mayor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. No. This isn\u2019t my work. Hahat! Aden was a little bit hard!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Occasionally, there were people who became nervous about Crockta\u2019s group.\u00a0</span><span>\"Mayor. Who is that orc and that gnome? The situation is chaotic and...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhh, they are my friends. They helped a lot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you say so, Mayor.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Radet toured the city once before returning to City Hall.\u00a0</span><span>He had yet to decide what to do with Driden and Aden, who were tied up.</span></p><br/><p><span>Radet sighed, \"Let's hold off until Jamero returns.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He ignored Aden\u2019s poisonous glance and struck his back.\u00a0</span><span>\"If you were caught in some magic, I have to consider that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He believed that there was a shaman who was assisting the great chieftain.\u00a0</span><span>Aden didn\u2019t deny it. He didn\u2019t think he would fall for such a trick, but he wasn\u2019t going to throw away the chance of cutting down his punishment after being defeated. He certainly was an opportunist.</span></p><br/><p><span>Radet\u2019s gaze turned towards Driden.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDriden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Radet called his name.\u00a0</span><span>Driden shook his head no emotion on his face. However a raging fire could be seen within his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe son of Hurio.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Driden nodded in response.</span></p><br/><p><span>Radet recalled the past.</span></p><br/><p><span>Hurio used a pair of swords, just like Driden.\u00a0</span><span>His nickname was sword demon.\u00a0</span><span>He swung his swords like two demons were attached to his arms.\u00a0</span><span>And Radet killed him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I definitely killed him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Driden\u2019s hands twitched. He was instinctively looking for his swords. However, there was nothing he could wield.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut I don\u2019t regret it. Do you know what your father was like?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He was a madman who killed everyone around him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s right. Hurio wasn\u2019t in a normal state. He was a swordsman who traveled around the north on an adventure, but suffered critical injuries in a fight one day.\u00a0</span><span>The wounds could be treated, but the pain and fallout from it caused him to become paranoid, eventually turning him into a madman.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you know?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Driden dropped his head.\u00a0</span><span>He spat on the ground and looked back up, this time with no emotion in his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cSo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I did what I had to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It doesn\u2019t matter.\"\u00a0</span><span>Driden looked at Radet\u2019s neck. If he managed to get his hands on anything around him, he would slice away at Radet\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span>He would perform the given task without any emotions, like a butcher mechanically cutting up meat.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I was also doing my job.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Driden responded and Radet realized something.</span></p><br/><p><span>Driden was a sword.\u00a0</span><span>He was a sword that was smelted by Hurio and then wielded by Aden in order to achieve a goal.\u00a0</span><span>He was an incomplete weapon that could only orbit the enemy, unable to turn or stop on his own.</span></p><br/><p><span>He only looked at his task: To kill the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Put everyone in jail.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The garrison soldiers dragged them out one by one.\u00a0</span><span>They would be detained in jail. He would wait for Jamero\u2019s advice before making the final decision.</span></p><br/><p><span>Radet returned to his office.\u00a0</span><span>He sat on the chair.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Countless documents were on the wide table.\u00a0</span><span>This was the battlefield he was facing right now.\u00a0</span><span>There were a number of public works waiting for his signature, from minor administration to cooperation with Spinoa and countermeasures against the Great Clan.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now his body was like Nameragon, so the enemy\u2019s sword was also heading towards his body.\u00a0</span><span>Compared to this, it was much simpler when he traveled around the world with a sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>He recalled the three visitors. The orc warrior Crockta, the gnome soldier Tiyo and the half elf from Nuridot, Anor.\u00a0</span><span>Radet was once like that.\u00a0</span><span>He felt envious.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He laughed and shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t want to return to the past. The memories he recalled with an ambiguous smile, they weren\u2019t always good. Radet\u2019s eyes always looked at the reality he faced.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the past, his enemies were people who wielded the sword right in front of his eyes. But now his enemy was the north.\u00a0</span><span>The dark elves would find it hard to overcome the waves of hardship that the great chieftain would create. Therefore, he needed to be more firm.</span></p><br/><p><span>This weapon should be something other than a sword.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Knock knock knock.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Someone knocked on the door of the office.\u00a0</span><span>Radet grinned and said, \"Come in.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor.\u00a0</span>Radet pointed to the chairs opposite the desk and welcomed, \"Please relax.\u201d</p><br/><p><span>Crockta didn\u2019t sit down.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI need your permission to enter the Temple of the Fallen God.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Correct.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPlease allow it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Radet smiled. It wasn\u2019t easy for him to negotiate.\u00a0</span><span>\"Not just anyone can enter the Temple of the Fallen God...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo puffed up as he proudly proclaimed, \"We aren\u2019t just anyone! We are benefactors who saved Nameragon </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That\u2019s correct but...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta saw Radet\u2019s mock hesitation and said, \"Radet, stop pretending and tell us what you want.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Radet nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\"Crockta, you noticed quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What else do you want from us </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>? You are really shameless.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'm sorry but I\u2019m not a single body.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Radet shrugged and knocked on the table. The papers were piled up. He meant that Nameragon was his share as well.\u00a0</span><span>\"If you go to Nameragon\u2019s jail, Driden will be trapped.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Please bring him around.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo frowned.\u00a0</span><span>\"No, why do we need to bring that guy around? You do it </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I can\u2019t do it, but it might be possible for you. Especially if it is Crockta.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Radet gazed at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cDuring your fight, did you see Driden\u2019s face? He is that type of guy. A man stronger than him has to show him the way. Right now, he has lost his way and is only caught up in revenge for his father.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Radet rose from his seat and approached Crockta. He then handed over a piece of paper. Crockta\u2019s eyes narrowed as he read it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That stupid guy, tell him his fate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta headed towards Nameragon\u2019s garrison. There was a detention room in the basement.\u00a0</span><span>The defense leader guided Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Driden was staring into the darkness with both arms tied in a corner of the detention room.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOpen the door,\u201d commanded Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>The garrison leader looked at Crockta silently opening the door..</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We will be out here, so take care of it </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo folded his arms in dissatisfaction. He didn\u2019t know why Crockta was supposed to take on this task.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta entered alone.\u00a0</span><span>Driden turned his head. Crockta\u2019s massive body filled the jail as he looked down at Driden.\u00a0</span><span>There was a faint smile on Driden\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hey. Orc.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDark elf.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Driden was imprisoned without proper clothes.\u00a0</span><span>There were bruises all over his body and his lips were swollen from beatings.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he said, \u201cIt was fun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>Radet was right.\u00a0</span><span>This guy was a sword that needed constant enemies. It was understandable why his father was crazy.\u00a0</span><span>A sword needed to be swung at someone.\u00a0</span><span>So far, Aden had been holding the hilt and now Radet wanted to hold it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI had a moderate amount of fun.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta, no, Jung Ian, was once a sword in the hands of others. The most regrettable thing about his past actions was that they weren\u2019t based on his own will, but on other people\u2019s decisions. Even if he felt regret, he could tolerate if he decided it for himself. But his past self didn\u2019t do that.</span></p><br/><p><span>He thought of the Ian \u00a0of the past every time he saw Driden.\u00a0</span><span>This guy was like a bird who just broke out of his shell and didn\u2019t know anything.\u00a0</span><span>He just swung the blade.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta lowered his head so that he was eye level with Driden. The swordsman frowned as the orc\u2019s rugged face was pushed in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPhew.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta sighed and shook his head. He didn\u2019t even appreciate a handsome face and was just a baby swinging a sword.\u00a0</span><span>\"Pathetic guy.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's fine.\"\u00a0</span><span>Crockta got up.\u00a0</span><span>\"What would you have done if you had killed the enemy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No plans?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is none of your business.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If it doesn\u2019t exist, just say so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Crockta slapped Driden.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Slap!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Those outside who heard the sound were more surprised than Driden, the one who had been hit.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...Shit.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Driden bowed his face after he was slapped. He checked his mouth with his tongue and spat out blood.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta spoke, \"Are you angry?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Driden raised his head.\u00a0</span><span>His eyes were blazing.\u00a0</span><span>It was like he was looking at a mortal enemy with a burning anger in his eyes. His arms twitched as if they were saying that he wanted to wield a sword at that very moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>The depth of emotion was different from when he was being beaten by the guards.\u00a0</span><span>The insults of others didn\u2019t reach him.\u00a0</span><span>However, the slap of the orc was like pouring boiling hot oil on him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis look is good. When you kill the enemy, come back for revenge.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed as he looked at Driden\u2019s eyes that now looked alive.\u00a0</span><span>Then he dropped the piece of paper that Radet had given him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Judge who the enemy is for yourself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Driden\u2019s gaze turned towards the paper.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis brat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Slap!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at him and slapped Driden one more time before leaving straight away. He felt a terrifying gaze stuck on his back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis bad... Ugly orc!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Driden\u2019s incensed voice was heard for the first time. The bad guy, the ugly orc left the jail.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta hurriedly escaped the underground detention room.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPhew. He has a temper.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As soon as he left, the guard handed him something and said, \"Take this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta accepted it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The mayor told me to give this to you after you met Driden.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a permit to enter the Temple of the Fallen God. Radet said to give the permit, regardless of his success or failure.\u00a0</span><span>He was a relatively tricky dark elf.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you. Tell Radet that I did my best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...That includes slapping him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is an orc thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta left the garrison building.\u00a0</span><span>Finally, he could reach his destination, the Temple of the Fallen God.\u00a0</span><span>He could finally go there.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut what did it say on the piece of paper you gave to the dark elf </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d asked Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shrugged.\u00a0</span><span>\"It was about his father.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The elf named Hurio?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. Radet killed his father. The paper stated why Hurio became a madman.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hurio received critical wounds and became a murderer after that.\u00a0</span><span>If he didn\u2019t get hurt, Hurio might\u2019ve remained as a swordsman and not be killed by Radet.\u00a0</span><span>And the one who wounded him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was an attack by an orc from the Great Clan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo nodded. Driden had to choose if his enemy would still be Radet, or if he should turn his sword and become hostile to the Great Clan.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"By the way, that dark elf called Driden,\u201d quietly interrupted Anor.\u00a0</span><span>There was a serious expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy, did you find something <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s a little weird.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you saying <em>dot</em>?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo focused on Anor\u2019s words.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor said.\u00a0</span><span>\"Doesn\u2019t he know any curses? Ahahahat. Bad guy, ugly orc... What a young baby. Ahahahat. Saying things like that. Really funny.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If I had been slapped, I wouldn\u2019t have stopped with that. The dog bas....oof ooof!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStop it </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo blocked his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>Anor continued trying to assert himself. Crockta joined in to cover his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHup hup! Fuup! Fuup yop doppp! Hup hup!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Putting up with this </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>..\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnor, children are watching...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The dark elf children walking down the street were shocked and fled. Crockta shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>Anyhow, they somehow managed to reach the Temple of the Fallen God.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Mayor, Driden surrendered.

Leave.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The knights immediately glanced at each other.\u00a0</span><span>They knew that they couldn\u2019t stop Crockta if he attacked them.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta had defeated Adandator. They couldn\u2019t beat him unless they dragged an army over.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta. I saw the duel.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The knight with the highest status told Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\"I respect your skills. In that sense, I want to tell you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He looked at the residents. He understood the hearts of those who wanted to leave the south.\u00a0</span><span>But he couldn\u2019t go against the emperor\u2019s will.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don't try to go against His Majesty. The best judgment is for Crockta to join the empire and be with us. His Majesty promises wealth and honor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at him.\u00a0</span><span>The knight was serious.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta smiled bitterly.\u00a0</span><span>People judged the world based on their own viewpoints.\u00a0</span><span>His concern was appreciated but he could never be together with the knight.\u00a0</span><span>One day, they would meet on the battlefield and kill those on the other side.\u00a0</span><span>But that time wasn\u2019t now.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta felt a strange sense of sadness of irony about the world as he spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"My honor is different from your honor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was turned down. The knight nodded. </span><span>He looked at the residents and said,\u00a0</span><span>\"Don\u2019t think that you will be safe afterwards just because you\u2019re currently with Crockta. The southern residents can\u2019t leave without His Majesty\u2019s permission.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The residents were agitated.\u00a0</span><span>They didn\u2019t think that the empire would take such direct control.\u00a0</span><span>The freedom to go anywhere they liked on the continent, the empire had cast the shade of oppression over it. It all began with the emperor\u2019s emergence.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDamn emperor...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The residents cursed as they watched the backs of the retreating knights.\u00a0</span><span>Then they expressed their thanks to Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you. It is all thanks to Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSigh. It is very concerning. I wonder if we can go north...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Their first goal was the elf city called Riznari.\u00a0</span><span>It was a free city located a little away from Maillard where all types of species gathered.\u00a0</span><span>But based on the appearance of the knights, the empire had started to control all roads leading out of the south.\u00a0</span><span>It was questionable if they could reach their destination.</span></p><br/><p><span>They started to exchange opinions among themselves.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I would rather go to Espada...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am the opposite. If we go to Espada, we will definitely have to fight the empire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If I had to choose one of them it is better to fight the emperor!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Maybe we should just go and see...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You just saw it. We will just get caught!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>\"Crockta. Looking at the south... it might be better to leave this area first <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, but I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn order to fight the emperor, we must have troops. But you don\u2019t have that much power in the south <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was possible to defeat the great chieftain in the north because they had the force called the dark elves.\u00a0</span><span>In order to get rid of the emperor, forces hostile to the emperor were needed.\u00a0</span><span>The emperor would reveal his ambition soon, so it might be wiser to wait for the clash with forces from the elves, gnomes, and orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>But Crockta didn\u2019t want to do that.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will go to Espada and think about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Once he figured out Espada\u2019s situation, he would be able to make a decision about any future actions.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Maybe we can get some rest <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The discussion is getting longer.\u00a0</span><span>The residents in the south were having a discussion after meeting the knights to decide whether they should go north or go to Espada with Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ll keep going. I won\u2019t be intimidated.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then are you planning to take on the knights?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will go quietly. It can\u2019t be helped if I end up conscripted.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you think they will be so accepting? I would rather fight in Espada than be conscripted by the empire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHah, truly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As they talked, Crockta\u2019s group took out tools from their bags and started cooking. It was lunch time.\u00a0</span><span>The residents sat down and prepared to eat.\u00a0</span><span>Among the residents, there were those who continued discussing the future while the rest ate lunch.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crcokta chewed on beef jerky and looked at the distant horizon.\u00a0</span><span>If this was a normal trip, he would\u2019ve sung a song. However, the emperor had emerged and shattered this.\u00a0</span><span>He couldn\u2019t rest easily until he removed those who destroyed Alaste.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"After fighting the emperor...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>It was a similar story when he fought the great chieftain. Crockta looked up and spoke to Tiyo and Anor.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cLet\u2019s go back to Gridori and enjoy some rest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The emperor after the great chieftain. I\u2019m afraid that if we stop the emperor, a god will appear <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If a god blocks us, we should get rid of the god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKahahat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The meal ended and Crockta\u2019s group rose. Then they looked at the residents.</span><span>If their argument was prolonged, Crockta planned to leave for Espada first.\u00a0</span><span>But they seemed to have come to a conclusion.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe will go to Espada.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I wish you good luck.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The residents decided to split into two groups.\u00a0</span><span>There were those who would continue to Riznari, while the others would go to Espada.\u00a0</span><span>On the way to Riznari, there was a high probability of meeting the emperor\u2019s knights, but they couldn\u2019t think about fighting the emperor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt will be dangerous...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They won\u2019t kill us. At most, we will be punished before being conscripted by the emperor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I hope to see you again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The group said farewell and split in two. They said,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cGoodbye. I didn\u2019t know we would be breaking apart like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Life is about choices. It would be good if I could know the future.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta listened to their conversation and thought of a skill.\u00a0</span><span>If he used the \u2018Gray God's Eyes\u2019, he could see the other person\u2019s lifespan.\u00a0</span><span>However, he was reluctant to use this skill.\u00a0</span><span>It was a great skill but knowing the lifespan of someone else gave off a feeling of taboo.</span></p><br/><p><span>In particular, after finding out that Elder Lord was another dimension, he became more reluctant to use it.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t want to steal the intimate knowledge of another person\u2019s death.\u00a0</span><span>In addition, he didn\u2019t want to be forced to do something by this ability.</span></p><br/><p><span>Just like the name, this skill was the domain of the gods.\u00a0</span><span>But at this moment, he felt like he had to confirm their remaining lifespan.\u00a0</span><span>If he used this, he could guess if they were killed by knights or if they would make it safely to another city.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta hesitated before using the skill on the villagers in the distance.\u00a0</span><span>Then something emerged on top of their heads.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta felt dismayed.\u00a0</span><span>They would die in the near future.\u00a0</span><span>The same number was written above the heads of those continuing to the north.\u00a0</span><span>They would meet death on the same day.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Stop.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta turned his head.\u00a0</span><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The numbers showed once again.\u00a0</span><span>The numbers above their head were no different from those heading to the north.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta dropped his gaze, unable to look at the fate of those heading to their deaths.\u00a0</span><span>There was a procession of ants at his feet.\u00a0</span><span>There was something faint around them as well.\u00a0</span><span>The inevitably overwhelming marks of death were stamped all over this world.</span></p><br/><p><span>Death was equal, stamping the heads of both humans and ants.\u00a0</span><span>Not just humans and ants, but the land he stood on would be destroyed someday.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta once again regretted using the Gray God's Eyes.\u00a0</span><span>The power became stronger every time he used it.\u00a0</span><span>It was hard to breath when seeing the world of death through the Gray God's Eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, why are you so slow <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo approached him and asked.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta didn\u2019t want to see the mark of death above Tiyo\u2019s head.\u00a0</span><span>So he tried to stop the Gray God's Eyes.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment,</span></p><br/><p><span>[The Gray God's Eyes was originally a passive skill.]</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>A system message.\u00a0</span><span>No, it was a message from the \u2018Gray God\u2019.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Once you use it once, you will see them forever.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shook his head. It wasn\u2019t supposed to be like this.</span></p><br/><p><span>[But since it is a god\u2019s vision, I have changed the Gray God's Eyes into a skill that you can activate and deactivate.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Now you see that the world is full of death.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[They will meet death in the near future.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Do you want to save them?]</span></p><br/><p><span>[What choice will you make?]</span></p><br/><p><span>She asked Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta opened his eyes.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan operated on the logic of economic returns.

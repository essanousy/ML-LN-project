We are...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But before Crockta could finish speaking, the man aimed his machete at Crockta and said, \"Get lost, you thieves.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe aren\u2019t thieves...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta tried to explain but the machete moved even closer.\u00a0</span><span>The blade touched his skin.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s eyebrows twitched. \u00a0</span><span>But it was a fact that they had invaded the man\u2019s home. He decided to step back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I understand. We\u2019ll leave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The machete moved back. Tiyo, watching from the side, jumped in.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cAh! We...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShut up. Kid.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>The shocked Tiyo looked at the man and said, \u201cWhat did you say? K-Kid?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta seized Tiyo before he could aim \u2018General\u2019.\u00a0</span><span>The man approached the magic staff that was protecting the area. He touched something and the blue energy emerged again. It spread all over the place, creating a dim shield around the fence.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I just wanted to say that we didn\u2019t mean to do anything. Stay alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta said politely as he stood before the hole.\u00a0</span><span>The man glanced at Crockta and didn\u2019t respond. Crockta shrugged and crawled out through the small hole.\u00a0</span><span>The man gazed after the receding Crockta and muttered, \"Annoying people...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he approached the cow that was staring at him. It was the cow that Crockta and Tiyo saved.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You look well Skolla. \u00a0Were there any problems?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a soft voice, unlike the previous wild person who seemed like he would swing the machete at any moment. The man rubbed his cheek against the cow\u2019s face. The cow gave a long cry.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man responded like he could understand the cow\u2019s words. </span><span>The cow cried out again, \u201cMoooooo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man\u2019s eyes deepened as he looked back. He stared at the hole that Crockta and Tiyo went through.\u00a0</span><span>The man spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That doesn\u2019t mean that you owe them. They came in on their own so they can take care of the problems themselves.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man gazed into the air before sighing.\u00a0</span><span>\"I understand, I understand. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He approached the other cows and repeated the same greeting. Then he gathered the cows together and feed.\u00a0</span><span>After that, he looked at the forest that unfolded beyond the fence.\u00a0</span><span>This place was always damp and cloudy. A forest of darkness. Ordinary people who entered would get lost and become the prey of the creatures.</span></p><br/><p><span>The cows drinking from the water trough gave long cries.\u201cMoooooo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man filled his quiver with arrows.\u00a0</span><span>\"I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He is a very bad person. Isn\u2019t that right Crockta?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta responded to Tiyo, \u201cIt is true though. That we were uninvited guests.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But we protected his cows.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We also called the wyverns.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hmm hmm! Yes, but he called me a kid </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo jumped up and touched Crockta\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0</span><span>\"I am tall for a gnome </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! I\u2019m not a puny kid! I\u2019m only small compared to Crockta </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t laugh </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d Tiyo whined.</span></p><br/><p><span>They relied on the compass to head north. If they continued through the Forest of Creatures then the north would appear.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Surprisingly, there aren\u2019t many creatures.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They thought that they would be attacked endlessly the moment they entered the forest, but it was more calm than they thought.\u00a0</span><span>In particular, there seemed to be no signs of creatures in this area. The sounds of birds and insects were gone as well. There weren\u2019t even any wyverns occasionally roaming the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta touched the handle of his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tiyo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShh.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta raised a finger to his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cGo quietly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What did you see...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t see anything, but the area is too quiet. The Forest of Creatures is infamous for its dangerous creatures. There is only one reason for the silence here.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo understood what he meant and nodded.\u00a0</span><span>The absence of nearby living beings meant there was a nearby predator that they couldn\u2019t tolerate.\u00a0</span><span>Maybe Crockta and Tiyo had stepped foot into a dangerous place.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s go quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood</span><i><span> dot.</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They killed the sound of their footsteps and started to move.\u00a0</span><span>Vines dangled from tree branches and covered their view. Crockta pulled out his greatsword and sliced through them. The obstacles weren\u2019t a match for Ogre Slayer and were cut off cleanly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why would that guy live here?\u201d Tiyo muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don't know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was also curious about the man\u2019s story. It was a talent to have pierced a wyvern in an instant. What was the reason for living in this place?\u00a0</span><span>The man was apparently a hunter.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is in order to hunt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hunters lived by hunting. They proved themselves by killing stronger game. There must be a reason for the hunter to set up camp here.\u00a0</span><span>What type of opponent was the hunter trying to catch here?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Crockta flinched.\u00a0</span><span>A huge shadow had just passed above him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo raised his head. The branches, leaves, and vines covered the sky, so he couldn\u2019t see it properly. It was just a big black shadow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWyverns?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment they were about to resume walking...</span></p><br/><p><span>The shadow passed over their heads again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grasped his greatsword while looking up at the sky. The big body quickly passed through their field of vision.\u00a0</span><span>It was obviously bigger than a wyvern.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tiyo!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I-I saw it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo was already grabbing \u2018General\u2019. He aimed the muzzle towards the sky, but the shadow didn\u2019t appear again. Tiyo looked around.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo moved slowly as they watched the sky.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, a beast\u2019s growl resounded out from behind them, \u201cGrrrrrrr...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta hurriedly raised his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>Beyond the vegetation and vines, the form of the giant beast was being revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That...what...?\u201d Tiyo murmured in a trembling voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>The enormous face of an old man was staring at them, but its revealed teeth were that of a beast. Beyond the disheveled hair that was like a shaggy mane, two wings spread open, making its size even bigger.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a monster with the face of an old man, the body of a lion, and the wings of a bat. It was called a Manticore, a strong monster that appeared at the end of a dungeon. </span></p><br/><p><span>It approached Tiyo and Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta immediately retreated from its giant presence.\u00a0</span><span>The wrinkled face distorted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGrrrrr....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a horrible appearance. It resembled an old man but the strangely heterogeneous nature aroused disgust in him. The gangrene-infested face pushed forward and it opened its mouth wide, baring sharp teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKraaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Manticore rushed forward.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, Crockta almost unconsciously looked away.\u00a0</span><span>It was such a horrible existence. The momentum of the charge made him feel like he was facing a tank alone.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that time, a light emerged from behind Crockta\u2019s back and hit the Manticore.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGrrung!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Manticore slowed down. The rays of light continued to strike the Manticore. It was the support bombardment from Tiyo\u2019s \u2018General\u2019.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was almost ashamed.</span></p><br/><p><span>He tensed the muscles in his body and stared at the opponent in front of him. His muscles swelled like they were going to burst. He pushed against the ground with his strong thighs.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta leaped towards the Manticore with his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Manticore cried out,\u201cKuaaaaaaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta wasn\u2019t phased and shouted his battle cry, \u201cBul\u2019tarrrrrrrr\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A near physical pressure!</span></p><br/><p><span>The loud roar triggered the Essence rank skill, Army Crushing Roar. The Forest of Creatures instantly shook. The Manticore hesitated. A tremendous momentum was coming from the small orc rushing towards it.</span></p><br/><p><span>Steam seemed to rise from the orc\u2019s greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Manticore swung its paw.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s Ogre Slayer and the Manticore\u2019s claws collided. Sparks flew. As soon as the two attacks clashed, the Manticore tried to bite Crockta with its sharp teeth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I won\u2019t allow you </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018General\u2019 fired towards the Manticore again. The shooting was focused on the eyes. The Manticore was tormented by pain.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta didn\u2019t miss the gap created by the attack and stabbed Ogre Slayer into the Manticore\u2019s chest.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a greatsword that could tear even ogre skin. It made its way past the Manticore\u2019s thick skin and penetrated the epidermis. The blade was lodged within.\u00a0</span><span>The Manticore screamed, this time much louder and worse than before, \u201cKiyaaaaaaaaaaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was thrown back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the same with Tiyo behind him. He shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>Then a black aura started to flow from the Manticore.\u00a0</span><span>When the Manticore swung its tail, a black spark emerged and hit Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was unable to avoid it and flew back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Blood emerged.\u00a0</span><span>The black aura dug into his body and tried to crush Crockta. Crockta twisted his body as he tried to resist.\u00a0</span><span>The energy moved around his body like a snake. He sensed that if left alone, the energy would tear his body apart from the inside.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>[The Despairing Demon\u2019s Belt (Hero) has responded to the demonic magic power.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Its resistance to demonic power is used.]</span></p><br/><p><span>The belt around his waist started moving. The black energy retreated without invading Crockta any further. The belt\u2019s steel teeth drooled.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta hit the belt and calmed the Demon\u2019s Mouth down. The mouth shut and once again fell asleep.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo muttered, \u201cThat isn\u2019t an ordinary guy </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Now the Manticore was staring at Crockta and Tiyo with red eyes. \u00a0</span><span>It was already a mysterious creature but it had become more powerful after absorbing the magic power of the Forest of Creatures. The black energy was seen every time it moved.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is truly the Forest of Creatures.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>His tone was casual but his body was trembling. He was unsure of how to deal with it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will cover you in the rear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo manipulated the trigger of his rifle with a determined expression. He adjusted the output of \u2018General\u2019.\u00a0</span><span>General\u2019s bullets were fired using Tiyo\u2019s strength and would eventually endanger him, ut now wasn\u2019t the time to worry about that.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe won\u2019t die here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Manticore neared them.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes shone. He read the movements of the Manticore. It shook from side to side.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, the Manticore\u2019s terrible face appeared right before his nose.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A tremendous speed.\u00a0</span><span>The ugly face resembling an old man looked at him, like it was possessed by an evil spirit.\u00a0</span><span>It swallowed Crockta\u2019s upper body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUwaaat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His vision became dark. The stench of rotten bodies coming from the Manticore wafted into his nose. \u00a0</span><span>The teeth would chew on his body. Crockta closed his eyes in preparation for the moment.\u00a0</span><span>But the Manticore\u2019s mouth opened again. It retreated.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta thrashed in search of outside air. He smelled the saliva on his body. He turned his head and checked the Manticore.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>An arrow was lodged in the Manticore\u2019s neck.\u00a0</span><span>Outside of Crockta\u2019s field of view, another arrow flew, this time penetrating the Manticore\u2019s cheek.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKieeeeh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Black aura rushed out from its injury.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked at where the arrows were flying from and found the same man from before. He calmly fired his bow. Another arrow pierced the Manticore.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you doing?\" The hunter asked. It was far away, but Crockta could clearly read his lips.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta nodded and focused on his greatsword. The blood vessels in his body swelled as he firmly grasped Ogre Slayer.</span></p><br/><p><span>Leyteno\u2019s Vigorous Greatsword Technique!</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta jumped up.\u00a0</span><span>His goal was the Manticore. Ogre Slayer tore through the Manticore\u2019s neck. It wasn\u2019t completely cut before of its big size, only going halfway.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Manticore shrieked again. Blood poured out from its half cut neck.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta jumped up against to finish off the Manticore. The Manticore struggled but it couldn\u2019t resist. It completely lost its head and collapsed to the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>The ground shook as the huge mass hit it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Manticore\u2019s terrible face stared at Crockta. Crockta kicked it towards the opposite direction. He didn\u2019t want to see anymore.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta said to the hunter, \u201cThank you for saving us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But the hunter didn\u2019t answer. </span><span>He approached the Manticore and started to dismantle the body with his machete.\u00a0</span><span>First of all, he cut off the skin of the Manticore\u2019s face. Then he dissected the body and extracted a heart-like organ. A rotten smell spread out from it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man wiped the blood on the machete against the Manticore\u2019s mane.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...This guy\u2019s face can drive away many creatures. The heart is a lump of muscle, but it has the power to restore energy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Indeed, it was the knowledge of a hunter.\u00a0</span><span>The man stuck his machete in the Manticore and looked at Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy did you guys come here? Do you like adventures?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The hunter seemed a lot older close-up. The wrinkles on his face showed the traces of time and his beard had started to turn white, with gray hairs mixed in. However, the body was robust and didn\u2019t match the aged face.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta replied, \"We are going to the north through the Forest of Creatures.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\"What does that mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you know about the north?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is impossible. Foolish guys.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man scoffed at Crockta as he pulled an arrow out of the Manticore\u2019s body.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt is impossible to pass through the Forest of Creatures.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!

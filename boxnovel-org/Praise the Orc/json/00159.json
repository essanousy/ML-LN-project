It was rare for Keynes to show such a temper tantrum.\u00a0</span><span>Instead, the silent Rommel opened his mouth, \"He is a beast.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes nodded and said, \"A beast, a plausible yet strange analogy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He is smart, but only in comparison to other stupid beasts.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"And humans are people?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Keynes said with a laugh.</span></p><br/><p><span>He appreciated Rommel.\u00a0</span><span>He respected the parts of Rommel that couldn\u2019t be controlled, and that he had high abilities.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t you know that humans sacrifice themselves for others? But in the end, their instincts are to survive and reproduce.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span>\"I saw it in a book.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Sacrifice is an emotional thing. Follow the calculations of reasoning, not emotions. That is what a human is. Monkeys are those who follow emotions. Of course, it is funny when speaking about NPCs who have an artificial intelligence.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is interesting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes nodded. The answer was interesting. He learned a bit more about the person called Rommel. Keynes\u00a0</span><span>was a person who controlled others, but sometimes he needed people like Rommel. A partner who could think along the same lines as him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLuin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, Brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are the clan kids arriving soon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh? Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am speaking of the \u2018fortunate\u2019 kids...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Keynes touched his chin.\u00a0</span><span>\"If you think about it, you should do it properly. Then you can achieve your lifelong dream here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou don\u2019t understand?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"One person...are you saying you sent it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes laughed,\u00a0</span><span>\"Hey, it is a joke. Threaten them. Intimidate them. Do it well. Be a bad person. A bad person who properly manages those fortunate kids.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhh...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Luin nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYes. That is my specialty. I will manage the kids.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Luin grinned and left the room. He was in such a hurry that he didn\u2019t even close the door.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes looked at his back and clicked his tongue.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cTsk tsk...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel suddenly asked.\u00a0</span><span>\"What are you playing at in regards to Luin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPlaying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t you consider controlling people a game? You play with Emperor Akantor. Duke Christian was just a game.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes laughed. That\u2019s right. He steered people. It was possible because he gave them what they wanted.\u00a0</span><span>He made them think it was what they intended to do.\u00a0</span><span>People were engrossed in Keynes\u2019 sweet words and played like he wanted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLuin wants to play a bad guy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPlay a bad guy...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"As a child, he was ignored while growing up. What could he do, when he didn\u2019t have any power? So he just pretended to live a good life. Then once he got money and a nice car, he did bad things and spit in God\u2019s face. A truly clumsy bastard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But I thought you regarded him as a brother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Slightly. But this is this and that is that. I like him. His thoughts are transparent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes chuckled. Rommel also smiled and examined the map of the southern continent on the wall.\u00a0</span><span>The class \u2018War Maestro\u2019 wasn\u2019t just a name. He was always working.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How about me?\u201d Rommel asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What type of play are you doing with me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel looked at Keynes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes laughed and opened the bottle placed on the table,\u00a0</span><span>\"You are playing next to me. It is interesting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes acknowledged Rommel in his own way. Rommel received a cup.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat about you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Me? I...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes and Rommel made a toast.\u00a0</span><span>Soon they would lead the emperor\u2019s army.\u00a0</span><span>It was the best accomplishment they could enjoy as a user. The message window to celebrate their achievements kept flashing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m not playing. This is just me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes drank the alcohol and laughed.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta lifted a pen.\u00a0</span><span>The world of Elder Lord was really mysterious. He wrote a letter while thinking in Korean, but the words that appeared were in the continent\u2019s language instead of Korean.\u00a0</span><span>Nevertheless, he could understand the meaning.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe, what are we doing now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A member of \u2018He\u2019s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy\u2019 asked miserably while moving his pen.\u00a0</span><span>Unlike his facial expression, his hand was dazzling.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t know, we...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gilgamesh listened to their conversation and said,\u00a0</span><span>\"Perhaps it is \u2018fear\u2019...? Kukuk, I\u2019m envious...I lost such emotional nuances a long time ago... Kukukuk...!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Whew...Shaq should\u2019ve been...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Every time Gilgamesh said such things, Shaq would promptly attack him.\u00a0</span><span>Now there was no one restraining him. One person sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is going on with Shaq?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He posted on the forum. It seemed like something happened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shaq wrote on the forum that he wouldn\u2019t be able to connect to Elder Lord for a while. Everybody accepted it because they had their own lives.\u00a0</span><span>But due to his writing, the five members with Crockta became known.\u00a0</span><span>Shaq was lost so there were now only four, but they started to be called Crockta\u2019s five apostles in the community.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere is no one else coming?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They can\u2019t come to the south.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There were people who wanted to join. But when Crockta had been fighting the empire, they withdrew from the south.\u00a0</span><span>The type of users who could fight against the knights of the south wasn\u2019t common.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It looks like we really will die...\u201d one of Crockta\u2019s five apostles muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were currently writing letters of propaganda that provoked the emperor.\u00a0</span><span>Each of them would show their talent at mocking the emperor, drawing cartoons that would be sent to him.\u00a0</span><span>The letters would target everywhere, from the nobles to commoners, scholars, mages and even the Imperial Palace.</span></p><br/><p><span>A person with the stealth skill would infiltrate the empire and sneak it into the post office.\u00a0</span><span>The goal was to provoke the emperor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Just send this amount and then stop. They will begin to start tracking it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Unlike her worries, she started to show off her artistic talents.</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone did their best.\u00a0</span><span>Gilgamesh even drew a picture of the naked emperor being whipped.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta scratched his head.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt is a bit...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kukuk...Crockta, perhaps...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gilgamesh lowered his voice.\u00a0</span><span>\"Are you afraid of the emperor...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you talking about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then it doesn\u2019t matter what the level of this letter is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is true.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"So Crockta, take this pen and add things. More irritating! Make the emperor so angry that he loses his hair!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta lifted the pen. Then he began to add his own style to Gilgamesh\u2019s work.\u00a0</span><span>An arrow was placed above the head of the stripped and whipped emperor, then words added.</span></p><br/><p><span>[This is a wig. The emperor is bald.]</span></p><br/><p><span>It was propaganda stating that the emperor was bald.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hah...!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Gilgamesh covered his mouth with his hands.\u00a0</span><span>It was hard to believe his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cNo blood, no tears, no slander...! Any adults looking at this will shake in anger, not just the emperor. This is truly...! Kukuk...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is the scale of Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Indeed, your sense of justice is unlike anyone else...kukukuk...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone finished their work.\u00a0</span><span>A member of the thief class grabbed the packet of letters. He would go into the empire and send letters.\u00a0</span><span>There would even be a letter sent directly to the emperor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWill the emperor truly move?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Those with power are surprisingly simple.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta intended to bring the enemy\u2019s attack to himself. Using a common word, it was to attract aggro.\u00a0</span><span>The imperial troops were spread out over the entire south.\u00a0</span><span>Villagers who surrendered were already provided labor for the empire\u2019s convenience.\u00a0</span><span>If this happened, it would be hard to save the people.\u00a0</span><span>It was better to anger the emperor and gather the army.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"However, once the emperor has gathered his troops...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But the others were worried.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you sure about this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s point was true, but for this strategy to be successful, they needed to be able to deal with the enemy.\u00a0</span><span>There was no point gathering the enemy only to die.\u00a0</span><span>And they believed that Crockta had a clear way. Maybe an army of orcs would appear. Or maybe the cities of the continent will help...</span></p><br/><p><span>But Crockta just shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I have no thoughts.\"\u00a0</span><span>Crockta told them.\u00a0</span><span>\"I will think about if after the enemies gather.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a shocking answer. He had no thoughts.\u00a0</span><span>However, they strangely weren\u2019t worried.\u00a0</span><span>As long as they were with Crockta, it felt like they could succeed in anything.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let\u2019s think about it later. Kulkulkul, bul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKukuk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They nodded.\u00a0</span><span>If they worried about the future, they wouldn\u2019t have succeeded in the many fights they experienced.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the video of the fight at Chesswood, Crockta had said,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018That is the calculations of a human.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He had different calculations than humans. His formula didn\u2019t consider things like the size and strength of the enemy.\u00a0</span><span>Even though it changed from a village to the empire, this person\u2019s calculations hadn\u2019t changed at all.</span></p><br/><p><span>How far could this man go?</span></p><br/><p><span>The users exchanged glances.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Everyone, are you going to do it all the way?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKukuk...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They would die.\u00a0</span><span>From the viewpoint of the users, this was a reckless quest. It was an impossible mission with a hell difficulty, where the odds was close to zero.\u00a0</span><span>But it didn\u2019t matter.\u00a0</span><span>They were now with Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>This was the most fun they had in Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta told them.\u00a0</span><span>\"If the emperor\u2019s eyes turn away from other villages and come to catch us, that is enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The \u2018He\u2019s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy\u2019 decided to just follow Crockta and see what would happen.\u00a0</span><span>Anyway, he was a man impervious to calculations.</span></p><br/><p><span>Their plan was successful.\u00a0</span><span>There was news that the imperial army was converging.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Guys! Everybody listen,\u201d Keynes said.</span></p><br/><p><span>Those in front of him were the elites of the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"At this time, Rommel and I have become nobles.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The members of the Heaven and Earth Clan applauded.\u00a0</span><span>It hadn\u2019t been possible for a user to become a noble since the launch of Elder Lord, so this was an unimaginable accomplishment.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Guys. Is Elder Lord fun?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Keynes smiled.\u00a0</span><span>\"Where else could you kill people and pillage villages? This is why Elder Lord is fun. We can do things we\u2019ve always wanted to do, but never could.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Heaven and Earth members laughed.\u00a0</span><span>In the past, they had won wars, trampled the rebels under the emperor\u2019s name, and enjoyed all sorts of looting.\u00a0</span><span>They carried out the actions without any hesitation because it was a game.</span></p><br/><p><span>They finally understood why there were endless wars in human history.\u00a0</span><span>The winners who were given rights coveted it again, just like drugs.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Dialph, no, Park Kwangchul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He called a clan member. The clan members focused their attention.\u00a0</span><span>Keynes only called their real name when something important happened.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Weren\u2019t you praised because you worked well before?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI sent money to your account.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You\u2019ll die if you use it for something else.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Keynes approached him and touched his shoulder.\u00a0</span><span>\"Use it for a car, a foreign car. Understood?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The clan members all understood his will. Prior to any important work, Keynes would raise morale by giving out rewards.\u00a0</span><span>It was a message that all of them could get a reward like Dialph.\u00a0</span><span>In addition, the prize was enormous.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"After buying it, send me a picture to prove it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes laughed and Dialph bowed with a thrilled face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBrother, thank you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You should thank your parents, for giving birth to such a wonderful son. I just showed my appreciation.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you, Brother!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This brat. Come on everyone. I don\u2019t want him to be the only hard worker.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Keynes tapped his shoulder before going to stand next to Luin. Luin grinned as he raised his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"When the war begins, listen to Rommel. Rommel is the best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Of course, there was no need to ask.\u00a0</span><span>Rommel\u2019s \u2018War Maestro\u2019 was a fraudulent class that forced soldiers on the battlefield to obey him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let\u2019s play a fun game today.

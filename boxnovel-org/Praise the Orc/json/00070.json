Now he was almost at the behemoth.\u00a0</span><span>The behemoth didn\u2019t move as it watched Crockta\u2019s movements like it was expecting an attack. </span><span>It happened the moment Crockta entered between the behemoth\u2019s two big paws.</span></p><br/><p><span>The behemoth stamped its feet, causing the earth beneath it to shake.\u00a0</span><span>The behemoth\u2019s foot was about the size of a house, causing what seemed like an earthquake. Crockta desperately tried to avoid it while maintaining his balance. It was like a huge press machine constantly descending towards him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood luck, Crockta,\u201d Shakan muttered as he watched.</span></p><br/><p><span>Someone had to draw the behemoth\u2019s gaze, and Crockta was perfect for that role. The skin of the belly was pointed out as a weak point, but it was almost impossible to stab there directly.\u00a0</span><span>Now, the only thing that remained was their share.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tiyo, aim for the eyes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I understand dot!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is a forest where the regeneration of creatures is close to infinite. However, if you hit the eyes then you can temporarily stop it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In the past, Shakan had pierced the behemoth\u2019s eyes, causing it to jump around in a huge rage. However, after a while, dark energy appeared and restored it, like the eye hadn\u2019t been hurt in the first place.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had been helpless in front of such an immortal monster.\u00a0</span><span>But this time would be different.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo\u2019s \u2018General\u2019 emitted a bright color and attacked the behemoth\u2019s eyes. It wasn\u2019t lethal, but the artifact was effective in shaking the enemy and stopping its movements.\u00a0</span><span>The behemoth shook its head and General\u2019s bullets started to veer from their target.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Calm down.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The muzzle is shaking </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo lamented and started to kneel.\u00a0</span><span>Shakan was confused.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTiyo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kneeling during battle.\u00a0</span><span>Kneeling was traditionally a sign of submission.\u00a0</span><span>However, Tiyo\u2019s expression was still determined. It wasn\u2019t the expression of a loser. </span></p><br/><p><span>Then Shakan muttered as he saw Tiyo\u2019s next move, \u201cIndeed...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This was a technique of the Quantes Gnomes Garrison.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo was in a \u2018down shooting\u2019 position.</span></p><br/><p><span>It had the highest precision that was incomparable to shooting while standing. It was a ruthless position that showed no signs of mercy, a form of marksmanship that intended to thoroughly crush the enemy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Aim cruelly and mercilessly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The earth and the body united to aim at the enemy.\u00a0</span><span>The specialty of a rifle that couldn\u2019t be imitated by archery.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo\u2019s General fired.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...Dammit!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>But his shooting was significantly off the mark.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo hadn\u2019t taken into account the behemoth\u2019s great height. With his prone position, he couldn\u2019t raise his aim high enough to hit the eyes. At best, he could only hit the body.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo rose to his feet again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFailure!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It was a good try though.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>As they were talking carefreely, Crockta shouted desperately from underneath the behemoth, \"What are you doing behind meeeee!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A giant paw passed right underneath Crockta\u2019s nose. Tiyo recovered his spirit as he saw that Crockta was in danger.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSorry </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! I\u2019m trying again </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His short legs scrambled as he hurriedly moved to a big rock and placed the rifle onto it. It was a sitting posture firing technique. Since he could lean against obstacles, it achieved the same level of precision as kneeling down and he could aim at a higher angle.</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t make any mistakes this time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is the strength of the Quantes gnomes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The magic bullet from General precisely hit the behemoth\u2019s eye. The behemoth twisted its head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuooooooooh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>While the behemoth\u2019s attention was caught by Tiyo\u2019s shooting, Crockta took the risk and jumped between its legs. The skin of its belly was revealed before Crockta\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tarrrrrrr\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta jumped while shouting.\u00a0</span><span>It was thinner than ogre leather, but had a stronger defense. Steam rose as he used Leyteno\u2019s Vigorous Greatsword Technique and stabbed firmly. </span><span>\u2018Ogre Slayer\u2019 barely penetrated the behemoth\u2019s skin. The flesh was torn by the blade.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuoooooooooh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The behemoth shouted angrily. It was a low-frequency shout that caused the earth to ring. Crockta\u2019s eardrums were rattled. Crockta\u2019s body became stiff.\u00a0</span><span>He heard the behemoth\u2019s big feet moving. A shadow fell above Crockta\u2019s body. Crockta looked up blankly.</span></p><br/><p><span>He couldn\u2019t avoid it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta whispered and closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>The foot was just about to stomp on him.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, a bolt flew from a distance and bounced off the behemoth.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kwaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The behemoth\u2019s body was pushed back by the explosive destructive power.\u00a0</span><span>It was a slim arrow, but it contained enough destructive power to push back the vast behemoth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is a hunter\u2019s arrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan readied a new arrow.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta started to move again. Crockta fought under the behemoth\u2019s body while Shakan fired an arrow whenever it was needed.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>He placed a powerful \u2018will\u2019 in the arrows.\u00a0</span><span>In the world of Elder Lord, the possibilities were endless.\u00a0</span><span>Just willpower!</span></p><br/><p><span>It hit the enemy as physical force. Some called it praying while others called it aura. But for Shakan, it was just a fierce desire to pierce the enemy. Although Crota's sword contained some will, he was just barely walking along the entrance of this field.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Look, rookies! I am the last Shakan!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He gave a rare scream.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s spirited struggle influenced Shakan as Shakan moved his body.\u00a0</span><span>Now it seemed like he could kill anything.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe Shakan hunt everything! Now it is your turn!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The behemoth\u2019s gaze turned to Shakan like it understood.\u00a0</span><span>It ignored Crockta annoying it and started to move.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kuuong!</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Kuuong!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201cScatter, Tiyo!\u201d Shakan shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan and Tiyo quickly retreated. But due to the difference in size, it was inevitable that the behemoth would arrive quickly. There was a huge shadow over their heads.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t ignore meeeeee\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A roar containing willpower!</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta had followed the behemoth and jumped up while swinging Ogre Slayer. The greatsword was lodged in its buttocks and Crockta clung on tightly. The behemoth shook its lower body but it couldn\u2019t get rid of Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t look at anyone other than me, monster!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned. Then he used the greatsword to climb to the top of the behemoth. The behemoth twisted before losing its balance and falling down.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta removed Ogre Slayer from its ass. The behemoth was troubled by the pain.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Now!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Shakan launched their attacks. Tiyo\u2019s magic bullets struck the behemoth\u2019s body while Shakan fired arrows all over the place. The behemoth was in pain. Crockta headed towards its head.\u00a0</span><span>The angry behemoth opened its mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>Right now, the size difference wasn\u2019t a huge advantage.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuaaaaaaaah!</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a horrible shriek!\u00a0</span><span>The shout was terrible enough to paralyze them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the behemoth breathed in. The demonic energy of the surrounding area was sucked into the behemoth\u2019s mouth. Crockta stabbed Ogre Slayer into the behemoth\u2019s back, but the behemoth continued to breathe in.</span></p><br/><p><span>A tremendous concentration of demonic power started to form in the behemoth\u2019s mouth. Tiyo couldn\u2019t stand it as he turned his head and covered his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t because the light was too dazzling for his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>On the contrary, the darkness was too thick.\u00a0</span><span>It felt terrifying; it was like his soul was being sucked in.</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan\u2019s opened his eyes wide and resisted it. He aimed his arrow at the darkness inside the mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>'This is the behemoth\u2019s imperial wrath.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan knew that attacking its eyes and belly wasn\u2019t enough to kill it. He found out that the real weakness of the behemoth was the sensitive mouth, just like a dragon.</span></p><br/><p><span>Just like a dragon could use breath, the behemoth was able to shoot out the deadly demonic magic. There was a short moment when the condensed energy would flash with a brilliant color. It was the authority of a breath attack.</span></p><br/><p><span>He needed to penetrate through it.\u00a0</span><span>Shakan gritted his teeth. The energy was now aiming at Shakan. Tiyo was already running away. However, Shakan stood in his spot and confronted it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShakan! Avoid it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo shouted. But the sound didn\u2019t reach Shakan\u2019s ears.\u00a0</span><span>Laughter emerged.\u00a0</span><span>A gust of wind swept through his hair. His body seemed to be pushed back. But he never moved his gaze from the center of the storm.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Father, we are Shakan.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, we are Shakan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t have a name.\u00a0</span><span>Only Shakan.\u00a0</span><span>He was Skolla, Penando, Achilles, and in addition, his dead wife. The history of all the Shakan on the continent flashed through his head. The weight of the clan was on his shoulders.\u00a0</span><span>Therefore, he wasn\u2019t a single hunter, but the Shakan Clan itself.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We killed a dragon and started the Shakan lineage!\u201d Shakan shouted like it was his last hurrah.</span></p><br/><p><span>His voice didn\u2019t reach far, as it was swept away by the storm.\u00a0</span><span>But he didn\u2019t stop as he shouted again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m going to kill you! Behemoth!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He pulled back the bowstring to its maximum extent. His will was nestled in the arrow.\u00a0</span><span>Both his endless hatred and resentment towards the behemoth were placed on it.</span></p><br/><p><span>The dark breath of the behemoth converged towards him.\u00a0</span><span>It was the darkness that didn\u2019t allow anything to shine while erasing the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta on the behemoth\u2019s back and the fleeing Tiyo wouldn\u2019t be affected by the disaster.\u00a0</span><span>They could survive.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Penetrate the core of darkness.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He had no other choice.\u00a0</span><span>A flash of light divided the darkness. As it penetrated the darkness, it gradually became a light that swept up the darkness. The beam of light moved through the darkness.\u00a0</span><span>It was a straight line without any errors.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Open up the North!\u2019</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a blast.</span></p><br/><p><span>The two forces hit each other and everything around them was swept away. Crockta fell off the behemoth\u2019s back and rolled for a long time. He could barely raise his head after a while.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>The behemoth flopped down.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta relied on Ogre Slayer as he barely managed to raise his body.\u00a0</span><span>Black smoke was coming from the half of the behemoth\u2019s head that remained.\u00a0</span><span>Shakan did it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShakan!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta moved his body to search for them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShakan! Tiyo!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo avoided the breath but Shakan had faced it directly. Crockta jumped in the direction where Shakan had been.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShakan!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The breath had destroyed everything.\u00a0</span><span>The land had a deep hole in the shape of a hemisphere. In the center of the hole was Shakan.\u00a0</span><span>Dust rose as Crockta hurried down the slope.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShakan!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He almost fell but he managed to reach Shakan. Shakan wasn\u2019t fine. There was a pool of blood around his body in the hole.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta held him.\u00a0</span><span>Shakan had a large hole in the middle of his body. Blood and guts flowed from it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was near death.\u00a0</span><span>However, his voice was the most cheerful Crockta had ever heard it. Shakan smiled faintly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Did I get it...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta clenched his teeth and endured it.\u00a0</span><span>Then he nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You got it.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow is it? Is Shakan a rabbit now...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta smiled and shook his head. Then he touched Shakan\u2019s cheek. It was gradually cooling.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cNo, the Shakan hunter pedigree is evident. You have caught your target.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuhuhuhu...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Shakan coughed up blood while laughing. Crockta calmed him down.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSay no more.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Now there is no...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment that Shakan spoke. \u00a0</span><span>His eyes suddenly grew larger and they trembled \u00a0Crockta realized that something was wrong.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta could see the scene in Shakan\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGrrrrrrr...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In Shakan\u2019s eyes, a huge creature was standing up again.\u00a0</span><span>It was the behemoth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He couldn\u2019t recognize the shape because half the head was gone. It shouldn\u2019t have been able to stand up after receiving that much damage. But what was the sight before him now? Crockta turned his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>Darkness was swirling around the behemoth\u2019s wounds. The darkness was repairing and replacing its wounds. It was missing half its head but a red light shone in the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Crockta felt despair.\u00a0</span><span>They wouldn\u2019t be able to win.</span></p><br/><p><span>He realized it. It was the first time he felt such a complete feeling of helplessness since he began Elder Lord. It was impossible to kill the behemoth.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta dropped his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShakan...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan was talking, \"A Shakan never leaves his enemies alive...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His body shook. He tried to raise his body from the ground. However, his intestines flowed from the hole in his belly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShakan!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe bag, open it...\u201d Shakan whispered. </span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shook his head and spoke, \u201cIt is okay now. You\u2019ve done enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta tried to pacify him. But Shakan exploded angrily at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>It was hard to believe the dying body could make such a sound.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Shut up!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I told you to open the bag! Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked into his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Fire was burning in it.\u00a0</span><span>An indomitable will.</span></p><br/><p><span>That was it.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the end, Crockta was forced to agree. He removed the bag from Shakan\u2019s bag and opened it. </span><span>A rotting stench came from the bag.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Inside the bag was a huge heart.\u00a0</span><span>The core of it was already rotting.\u00a0</span><span>It was the heart of the manticore that they killed. It was polluted with an awful smell. Crockta held it with trembling hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Feed it to me.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan said with a sigh.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPut it in my mouth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta saw the tenacity in his blazing eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he realized.</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan had repaired his collapsing body by killing creatures and eating their hearts. This was why he didn\u2019t look his age, the reason for his broken mind, and why he couldn\u2019t distinguish between the past and present.</span></p><br/><p><span>His body was already the same as all the monsters here, eroded by the demonic energy.\u00a0</span><span>However, his blood was still red.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was unable to resist Shakan\u2019s burning gaze and raised the heart to his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan chewed on it. He opened his jaw and bit it with force. He chewed on the muscles and absorbed its blood and magic power.</span></p><br/><p><span>His eyes were still blazing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The founder of Shakan killed a dragon and ate it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The black energy started to repair his body. His eyes were now black. He got up. The broken body had been stuck together like glue. He vomited up a black liquid.\u00a0</span><span>It was the same as the creatures.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI have to become a monster if I want to kill a monster.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He swallowed the heart until the end. His neck moved as he swallowed.\u00a0</span><span>Shakan laughed. He laughed as the black energy spread.\u00a0</span><span>He grasped the bow on his back. His eyes burned red. Soon, the creature called Shakan raised his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>The behemoth cried out loud as it noticed his presence.\u00a0</span><span>The two monsters stared at each other.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!

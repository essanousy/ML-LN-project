There were no noticeable users in the vicinity. It seems like they had withdrawn from Arnin.</span></p><br/><p><span>The elves living in the slums were at work, so it was quiet. Only the voices of the workmen building in the slums were occasionally heard.\u00a0</span><span>Were they doing something wrong?</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta wandered for a while before suddenly stopping in front of the construction site.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>It was due to the appearance of the sweaty workers holding the construction tools.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey! Move carefully! Don\u2019t get hurt!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Whew, why am I doing this in a game?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That\u2019s what I said.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A white star was shining on the foreheads of the workers.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta examined each one of their faces. There were NPCs, but the majority of them were users. They were wearing protective gear and using construction place jargon like they were actual builders.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey, Orc!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A man sitting on the floor and drinking water waved at Crockta. He also had a white star on his forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is the first time I\u2019ve seen an orc in Arnin! If you want to build a house then tell me! We can make it for cheap!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at the entrance of the construction site. The sign, \u2018Kangaroo Construction\u2019 was hung there. Below was an advertisement for prompt construction at low prices.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta asked,</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you people cursed by the stars?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEh? How do you know?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man was confused.\u00a0</span><span>\"Well, we are cursed but...does it matter? We are cursed, but we build for a cheap price, and we do it quickly. So if you have some land, tell me. We will build it nicely. Hahaha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were users who enjoyed the architectural field in Elder Lord. Their deft movements indicated that they were people who actually worked in the construction industry.\u00a0</span><span>There was a brief overview of the construction posted at the entrance of the construction site.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Name of Project: \u00a0New construction of the \u2018Benevolence Medical Aid\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Client: Arnin City</span></p><br/><p><span>Contractor: Kangaroo Construction</span></p><br/><p><span>Building Usage: Public medical and support for the underprivileged facility.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta scrutinized it carefully and the man shrugged.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you need a job? An orc should have enough strength so do you want to try it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. Do you know the Thawing Balhae Clan?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thawing Balhae? I know.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThey connected us to the mayor here. They are quite dishonorable, but we didn\u2019t have a choice. Do you know them?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see. Be careful not to tangle with them. It seems like they are doing bad things to amuse themselves. NPCs, no, they don\u2019t like orcs. Haha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The overseer called out to the man. He got up from his seat.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m going, I\u2019m going! So Brother, stop wagging your tongue!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man ran back and continued working on the construction. Crockta looked after him thoughtfully.\u00a0</span><span>Ilya had said that this building would become a villa for the rich elves, but that wasn't it. It was a medical facility for the poor. His mind became complicated.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ilya.</span></p><br/><p><span>His face popped into Crockta\u2019s head. He seemed friendly, but his real intentions were unknown. The surprised Thawing Balhae member seemed to know Ilya. He was killed by Ilya before he could open his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ilya made a deal with Derek.\u00a0</span><span>Derek wasn\u2019t a good man. Rather, it was the opposite. Derek and Crockta just joined hands to use each other. Crockta absolutely didn\u2019t trust Derek.</span></p><br/><p><span>Was he being deceived?</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta sighed. His purpose was revenge on the Thawing Balhae Clan. It wasn\u2019t necessary to worry about other things. Whether he was being used or not, it was sufficient if he wiped out the Thawing Balhae Clan.</span></p><br/><p><span>Therefore, he tried to turn away.\u00a0</span><span>But something kept nagging at him, making his heart uncomfortable. He stood still to think about it. Crockta closed his eyes and looked into his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ah.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta opened his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was him.\u00a0</span><span>He was there.\u00a0</span><span>He was watching Crockta from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand Lenox.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta touched his chest. The scar created by Lenox\u2019s axe would be there forever, along with the laws of a warrior that he preached.\u00a0</span><span>Before he left Arnin, he needed to know the truth about what was happening in this city.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t too late to decide how to act after confirming the truth.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta moved again.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Enyanis, the plains administrator, looked between the two people who came to visit him with a difficult expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>One of them was the orc warrior Crockta, whom Enyanis had directly granted an honorary citizenship.\u00a0</span><span>The other person was his friend, Secretary Alsein, who was Elsanad\u2019s shadow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, sit down. Alsein, what are you doing here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Enyanis served tea. The three of them were facing each other in the drawing room.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta didn\u2019t know who Alsein was and got straight to the point.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Enyanis, I have a question.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Enyanis nodded. It was the first time hearing the orc\u2019s voice. After becoming an honorary citizen, Enyanis learned that Crockta had been unable to speak due to Silence magic.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is Elsanad like as a mayor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Alsein looked at Crockta. Why was an orc asking about the mayor of this city?</span></p><br/><p><span>Enyanis burst out laughing.\u00a0</span><span>\"It is funny that you are asking me this when this friend is right in front of you. Maybe it is because of the disturbance that happened yesterday...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Enyanis pointed to Alsein.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHe is the mayor\u2019s secretary.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at Alsein. Alsein greeted him lightly.</span></p><br/><p><span>Enyanis said, \"For the answer, I\u2019m not saying this as his friend, but I personally think she is wonderful. Everyone\u2019s opinion is different, but I respect Elsanad. I don\u2019t believe Ilya\u2019s words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you know Ilya?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI know. Alsein, did you come because of Ilya?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Alsein nodded.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I know that he once worked with Elsanad. I heard that after Elsanad first became mayor, he caused trouble and was fired... He is probably spreading these rumors due to that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right, it\u2019s absurd. The mayor selling citizens? It isn\u2019t funny.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Alsein\u2019s voice was ferocious. Enyanis said,\u00a0</span><span>\"However, there are rumors that Elsanad ran away from him. The fact that she didn\u2019t deny his claim on the spot has left the citizens shaken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You should\u2019ve been there. Why did you do that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Alsein sipped his tea.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cCough. That...she shouldn\u2019t have to deal with such a person. There might be problems if she responds too quickly. It obviously isn\u2019t true, but it is a betrayal for the people who believe it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Regardless, an explanation is needed. Not responding will make the rumor more pervasive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I know.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Alsein thought about it.\u00a0</span><span>Then he looked at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cCrockta, it is nice to meet you. You have become an honorary citizen. Enyanis told me about your excellent behavior the other day.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It isn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"As a citizen who works with the mayor, I can say that the mayor absolutely isn\u2019t such a person. Of course, there are other things but... Thanks to these unusual aspects, she has done a good job. Arnin is prospering thanks to her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you have any more questions, then I will answer them now. Is there anything else you are curious about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was troubled.\u00a0</span><span>\"Well...how about the mayor\u2019s daughter?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He heard the other day that the mayor was worried about her daughter not listening to her.</span></p><br/><p><span>Alsein\u2019s face hardened for a moment.\u00a0</span><span>But then a smile appeared on his face.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHahaha. You are interested in her daughter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am just curious.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"She is beautiful like the mayor. She wants to keep working as a guard...that is the worry but...there are no problems. She is just young.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you continue to watch, then you will see that everything is fictional. Anyways, welcome to Arnin. I need to return to the mayor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Alsein rose from his seat. Enyanis said,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cAre you going already?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I forgot that the mayor called me. I'll come back next time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, thank you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Alsein left this place with large strides. Crockta was deep in thought as he looked at Alsein\u2019s back.\u00a0</span><span>As the door to the drawing room closed, Enyanis sipped his tea and said in a quiet voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"In fact, I have something to say to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is it...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Enyanis coughed. Crockta listened closely.\u00a0</span><span>\"The Arnin Plains\u2019 Rescue Unit, inspired by Crockta, is very responsive. The reaction is explosive. So it makes sense...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Can I draw a portrait of you? I\u2019ll also create a nice invitation for you and frame it... Hanging them side by side... Hmm hmm, it will go down in Arnin\u2019s history. I know a great painter...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...That\u2019s okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Just think about it once...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...It\u2019s okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStill...\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Elsanad looked up.\u00a0</span><span>She was in her office. Her desk and appliances were neatly arranged and all in harmony. The whole room looked like it was made for her. It was all Elsanad\u2019s vision.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlsein?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Mayor.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Alsein stood in front of her.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Didn\u2019t you get today off?\u201d She asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I have something to say to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Elsanad took off the glasses that she was using to look at the documents. Her vivid green eyes stared at Alsein.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There are some people who believe Ilya\u2019s words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The election is upcoming. It would be better to take care of this at once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Elsanad nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIf Alsein says so. Ilya still seems to have some complaints against me. I will personally explain it to the citizens. I\u2019ll ask Ilya about the rumors that are stirring up the citizens.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you have anything else to say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnd...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnd?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is about Elwina.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Elsanad cocked her head.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cElwina?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. Hasn\u2019t Ilya started acting? It might be dangerous for Elwina to go around like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"She is careful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Mayor.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I understand. I\u2019ll tell her. I\u2019ll explain it to her properly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Alsein nodded and bowed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then let\u2019s go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh? Where...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Didn\u2019t Alsein say it just now?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Elsanad got up from her desk and wore the coat that was hanging on the wall. The cloth was the colour of the sky, making her white skin shine. Elsanad dressed up and smiled at Alsein.\u00a0</span><span>The whole room seemed to light up from her beautiful smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m going to see the citizens.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Now?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Of course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Elsanad passed by Alsein.\u00a0</span><span>\"It won\u2019t be beautiful if they keep on talking. I need to get rid of it quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Alsein nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>Due to Elsanad\u2019s beautiful appearance, people often thought that she was gentle or weak. But she absolutely wasn\u2019t. Rather, it was close to the opposite.</span></p><br/><p><span>Elsanad was strong. She had difficult standards. The things that didn\u2019t meet those standards would be thoroughly excluded. She didn\u2019t care about contrary opinions. She just wanted to accomplish what she desired. In that sense, she was closer to being heartless than being gentle.</span></p><br/><p><span>Her beautiful appearance and attitude didn\u2019t reveal her essence.\u00a0</span><span>It was fortunate that her dream was Arnin\u2019s prosperity.</span></p><br/><p><span>After thinking this, Alsein spoke to Elsanad, \u201cI\u2019ll prepare the carriage. Where are you going?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The square. Everyone should be there. Prepare a podium.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. I will let the citizens know.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPlease.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Elsanad, Alsein, and her attendants headed towards Arnin\u2019s central square.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Ilya were also there.</span></p><br/><p>Reminder, I will be having a monthly Q&amp;A on the Wuxiaworld Discord Channel.

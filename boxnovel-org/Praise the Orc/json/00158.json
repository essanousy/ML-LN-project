Very quickly, a crowd began to gather around.\u00a0</span><span>It was bloody.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cT-That...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIdiot.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Kim Hyunchul looked down at it from the coffee shop on the second floor and clicked his tongue.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy is he an idiot?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The face of Park Hansik, who was sitting across from Kim Hyunchul, hardened as he asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>Despite the gruesome scene which had occurred before his eyes, Kim Hyunchul seemed to be emotionless.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat has been achieved? The child is hurt, and he isn\u2019t the only one. There\u2019s also another person who is hurt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy? It\u2019s true.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Hyunchul that Hansik knew wasn\u2019t such a person. Hyunchul was very timid but warm-hearted to his friends.\u00a0</span><span>However, he had started to change since playing the game.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you saying? He was trying to save the child.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCan\u2019t I be honest? After all, if that person dies, he would be the only one losing something.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis jerk\u2026 Your sins will be returned to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs this a mental victory? Encouraging good and punishing evil. It is just a concept that people use to comfort themselves.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t say that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOkay, is your job going well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is hard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Hansik took a sip of his americano and looked out the window again.</span></p><br/><p><span>People were surrounding the scene of the accident.\u00a0</span><span>A woman was hugging a child in her arms, regardless of the dirt on her clothes. Meanwhile, the other people tried to do first aid on the man who protected the child, but his body was bloody and pierced with glass.</span></p><br/><p><span>Fortunately, the man was moving, so he wasn\u2019t dead.\u00a0</span><span>He could hear the sound of ambulance sirens in the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Kim Hyunchul asked,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWork is hard?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Hansik looked at him.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat? Can you help me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course. Friends should help each other.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOkay. I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf you are having a really hard time, tell me, and don\u2019t hide it. I'll let you rake in money.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRake in money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, rake in money.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Kim Hyunchul grinned slyly.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou can make a few year\u2019s worth of money at once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the same face, but he now gave off a different impression.</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Hansik looked at Kim Hyunchul and drank his americano silently. Then he asked,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou said you played the game?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. If you are interested...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you role playing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRole play? I don\u2019t do such things.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hyunchul instantly stopped laughing. Park Hansik smiled at his expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Kim Hyunchul adjusted his posture.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhy are you smiling?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy are you smiling? I feel bad, like you are laughing at me. I\u2019m not just playing a game. It\u2019s business.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At the end of Kim Hyunchul\u2019s words, Park Hansik stopped smiling and narrowed his eyes, causing Kim Hyunchul to tense up slightly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Park Hansik shook his head with a smile.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI\u2019m not saying anything, you brat. Calm down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hansik just wanted to tease Hyunchul, but Hyunchul\u2019s pride was hurt for a trivial reason and he stiffened. Hyunchul had been like this since their school days.\u00a0</span><span>However, they were now adults and couldn\u2019t maintain the same relationship as before.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were no longer boys, and as adults, they had facial expressions that never existed before.\u00a0</span><span>Park Hansik\u2019s head shake meant he was resigned about something. Every time he did that, he erased someone he thought of as a friend.</span></p><br/><p><span>An old song played on the radio.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Even though seasons come again</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Where has my love gone</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>I didn\u2019t send you away</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>I didn\u2019t leave you either</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe song is killing my mood.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Park Hansik rose from his seat.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI\u2019m busy, so I should be going. It was good to see you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAlready?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI told you, work is hard. I have to work without any breaks.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, I understand. Don\u2019t overdo it. If it is difficult, contact me.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Kim Hyunchul handed Park Hansik a card.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt is the same as going on a deep-sea fishing boat. Of course, it is much more comfortable, and there is more income. You just need to lay down for a few months or a year, as if you are sleeping. I\u2019m telling you specifically...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Hansik received the business card. It had \u2018Luin, Elder Lord Clan\u2019 written on it.</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Hansik looked at Kim Hyunchul.\u00a0</span><span>Kim Hyunchul was wearing expensive clothes and an expensive watch, and he carried himself in an arrogant manner.\u00a0</span><span>Unpleasant emotions could be read in Hyunchuk\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Hansik smiled again.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYes. Stay well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Hansik said goodbye before turning around.\u00a0</span><span>Maybe he wouldn\u2019t meet Kim Hyunchul in the future.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kim Hyunchul looked at the leaving Park Hansik and leaned back.\u00a0</span><span>He smiled at Park Hansik. Then his nose twitched as he muttered to himself,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThat child still acts as if he is in high school... Too bad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He grumbled and took a sip of coffee.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he glanced out the window.\u00a0</span><span>The man from earlier was being carried into an ambulance. He was talking to the paramedics while lying down, so he didn\u2019t seem to be in any danger of dying.\u00a0</span><span>Then the ambulance closed its doors and departed.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was blood left on the ground where the man had been lying.\u00a0</span><span>There was no feeling of exhilaration. Hyunchul had seen this kind of sight many times in Elder Lord. These days, the blood in Elder Lord seemed more familiar than that of this world.\u00a0</span><span>Seeing the blood splattered on the ground was like meeting a familiar face in a strange place.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he suddenly heard the lyrics.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>It is gradually forgotten</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>I thought it was a love that would stay</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Another day goes by</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>We live apart every day</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, this song is depressing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kim Hyunchul closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>As he listened to Kim Kwangseok\u2019s song, memories of his \u2018Hyung-nim\u2019 talking to him popped up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018The world is all about trying to survive.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Those words...</span></p><br/><p><span>The past Hyunchul had been considerate, but that person had died. \u00a0Now, he was someone who mocked a man who had jumped to save a child, wore expensive clothes and drove a foreign car.\u00a0</span><span>Park Hansik, who sympathized with the man, ran a small bar and struggled to pay the monthly rent.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anyway, the world was unfair. Those who truly realized it also discovered that they had to be unfair. If he was more unfair to those who were unfair, that unfairness would work for him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018A good life? Don\u2019t make me laugh. Look at me. I am successful. Look at you. Because I live like this, I drive a foreign car. Don\u2019t worry about the excuses of a loser and just follow me.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHyung-nim was right.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Kim Hyunchul checked his phone. There was a message. It was from \u2018Keynes\u2019 who had made him like this.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was time to work again.\u00a0</span><span>Kim Hyunchul got up from his seat.</span></p><br/><p><span>Outside the cafe, a woman was sweeping up the blood-stained glass pieces. The broom was dyed red.\u00a0</span><span>Based on her apron, she seemed to work in a small restaurant next to the cafe.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kim Hyunchul looked at the scene quietly and asked,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt isn\u2019t your store, so why are you cleaning it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She replied back,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThis is important. It is the same neighbourhood that is my home. It is ugly. I don\u2019t want to wait for someone else to clean it up. Don\u2019t you think?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kim Hyunchul lit up a cigarette.\u00a0</span><span>There were so many good people in the world.\u00a0</span><span>So, he and his \u2018Hyung-nim\u2019 were bound to be successful.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kim Hyunchul spat on the floor and walked away while blowing cigarette smoke.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The emperor, Akantor, looked down at them from the throne.</span></p><br/><p><span>Luin was always nervous meeting him, but Keynes and Rommel seemed to be fine.\u00a0</span><span>Keynes always said it was a game, while Rommel wasn\u2019t the type of person to be shaken by this.\u00a0</span><span>Rommel had to learn all types of courtesies when Akantor had still been the king. Now that Akantor was the emperor, Rommel had to be more formal.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was accustomed to it now, but it still wasn\u2019t easy kneeling down. Luin was a modern man and unfamiliar with the class system.\u00a0</span><span>Of course, while playing Elder Lord, he learned about the class system which \u00a0wasn\u2019t visible in modern times.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCan I trust you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>When Akantor had been a king instead of an emperor, he had been a quiet man. He had always smiled, and he had looked more like a nobleman than a king.\u00a0</span><span>However, he now looked down with an arrogant face and didn\u2019t hide his feelings. It was the right of the strong.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf it fails, it is the end. I will prevent you from escaping to the abyss for eternity.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Luin\u2019s nose twitched nervously at the words. It meant Akantor would use the Concrete method.\u00a0</span><span>The fact that NPCs understood the weakness of those cursed by the stars gave Luin a strangely fearful feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was no different to what he felt when watching movies about robots conquering mankind.\u00a0</span><span>However, by walking this tightrope, they earned wealth and honour.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe will make certain of it.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Keynes said. He excelled in gaining favour with NPCs.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cPlease remember the role we have played to allow Your Majesty to sit on this precious throne. We will always devote our loyalty to Your Majesty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course. I\u2019m well aware. However, this is the empire. We can never fail.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow can Your Majesty talk about failure?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Keynes bowed his head.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThe trend in the world is heading towards the empire, Your Majesty. A pebble can\u2019t stop a river. Espada will be decimated.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the failure I\u2019m talking about.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The emperor leaned against his armrest.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou have to kill that orc.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes spoke with a serious face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. That ugly orc needs to be killed and hung at the gates. No, it would be nice to capture him alive and pour maggots and worms over him to gnaw on his body.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The emperor\u2019s anger had reached its peak.\u00a0</span><span>Everything flowed according to his will. No, it followed the blueprints presented to the emperor by Keynes and Rommel.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was the exception.</span></p><br/><p><span>The emperor wasn\u2019t the only one who wanted to kill him. It was the same for Keynes.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was an unpredictable variable for him. He wanted to get rid of Crockta and eliminate all possibilities of failure.</span></p><br/><p><span>However...</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour Majesty. Don\u2019t waste our forces on him. He is an individual. An individual can never beat an army. We should look at the bigger context, and he will eventually be trampled on by the army.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>To Keynes, Crockta was a stumbling block.\u00a0</span><span>However, he knew how stupid it was to consume energy to catch a bug.</span></p><br/><p><span>Luin nodded as he listened to the conversation.\u00a0</span><span>Keynes used to say this to Luin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe is a strong person, but he will lost the moment he goes against an army. He is alone. He is strong and difficult to catch, but not fatal. He is tricky like a mosquito. It is better for us to ignore him than worry about him. When winter comes, the mosquito will freeze and die.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Looking back at how much Crockta had interfered with them, Luin came to admire Keynes\u2019 sober judgment. Luin thought about using the full force of the army to kill Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>However, Keynes was right. Crockta was a monster who beat Adandator. He would somehow manage to run away.</span></p><br/><p><span>They just needed to do their jobs. Then one day, Crockta would be found as a corpse on the battlefield.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>The emperor said,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI want his head.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes bowed his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf Your Majesty...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut you always speak the right words. If it were someone else, I would set up a trap to kill Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a gentle tone toward a faithful servant.</span></p><br/><p><span>Luin laughed inwardly.\u00a0</span><span>Keynes would also be smiling.\u00a0</span><span>Everything went as Keynes said.</span></p><br/><p><span>The young emperor was merely a child who wanted to play a game. Sometimes he wanted to be dignified, while other times he wanted to be impulsive. There were also times when he wanted to be praised as a king.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had flimsy ambitions.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then at that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour Majesty, an imperial guard is waiting to see you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The guard shouted from outside the throne room. Then the emperor replied,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cSend him in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The door opened. A servant entered and knelt down before the emperor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour Majesty, I am an officer on the west side, Gospel.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. What is going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI saw this and thought Your Majesty should know...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He held out a piece of paper.\u00a0</span><span>It was a letter.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is being sent out randomly all over the empire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is this...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The emperor accepted it.\u00a0</span><span>The guard closed his eyes and fell facedown.\u00a0</span><span>His choice was right.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kwaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The emperor threw an ornament decorating his throne.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRommel! Keynes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, Your Majesty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI want that garbage orc called Crockta on his knees before me! I will give you Adandator and the White Lion Knights!

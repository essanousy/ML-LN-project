It was the beginning of destiny.\u00a0</span><span>He\u2019d met Anor there, fought the great chieftain, and eventually conquered the north.\u00a0</span><span>Next was the south. He\u2019d met an Alaste knight there and learned about the empire\u2019s ambitions. Then he rescued the city from an army.</span></p><br/><p><span>They had been through many things.\u00a0</span><span>Now, they were heading on a new path.\u00a0</span><span>Their goal was the west.\u00a0</span><span>It contained the magnificent Orcrox and Basque, as well as the mountain cities of the orcs.\u00a0</span><span>There were a wide variety of orcs present in unknown territory on the continent. Beyond that was Geherad.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Geherad was the ancient word for \u2018last fire.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe last fire, is it an incredibly hot place <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTsk. Think about it. It would be something figurative.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat do you think when you hear last fire <em>dot</em>? Heat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNot that. Um\u2026 passion? A place where passionate people live?\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>They walked for a long time after leaving Katalu.\u00a0</span><span>After heading north-east from Katalu, a great forest appeared. From there, it was a long march to Geherad.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a small village at the entrance of the forest.\u00a0</span><span>It was commonly known as the \u2018resting area.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBe careful. I heard rumors that the prices are expensive <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Crockta is rich.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed, there is a saying that a friend\u2019s money is our money <em>dot.</em>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...It is the first time I\u2019ve heard that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The great forest was a rough place. However, there were adventures, treasures, and magic hidden throughout. There was also a city like Geherad, where mysterious species lived.\u00a0</span><span>That\u2019s why adventurers who wanted to enter the forest stayed at this village for a while.\u00a0</span><span>They could gain equipment, information, and companions from the village. The great forest was a tough place, so it was advantageous to have as many people as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span>There were adventurers shaking placards at the entrance of the village.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Recruiting people to explore Darunen Dungeon.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Looking for people to hunt trolls.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Looking for an adventurer to accompany me to Seoru Academy.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Looking for people with courage.]</span></p><br/><p><span>They were all gathering people.\u00a0</span><span>Many showed interest in Crockta\u2019s party.\u00a0</span><span>There was a dignified orc warrior, a gnome with a mysterious artifact, and an unknown hooded person, who gave off dark energy.\u00a0</span><span>They seemed strong and skillful. The adventurers waved their placards towards the party with eager eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone was preparing to enter the forest for various purposes.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s party didn\u2019t respond and headed straight into the village.\u00a0</span><span>There were inns, restaurants, and equipment stores all over. Houses for residential purposes were rare.\u00a0</span><span>In other words, most of the villagers were wanderers.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe will stay the day and head off tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood dot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They didn\u2019t need another party member, so they headed straight to an inn. It cost a lot to stay for just one day.\u00a0</span><span>Then at that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span>A man holding a placard was staring at them from the entrance to the inn. A bearded dwarf.\u00a0</span><span>He looked at Tiyo, who was a similar height to him, and then at Anor and Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Then he moved his placard closer.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Geherad.]</span></p><br/><p><span>There was only a brief description of his destination.\u00a0</span><span>He was already confident they were going to the same place after hearing the conversation that went on within Crockta\u2019s group.\u00a0</span><span>However, his shabby appearance didn\u2019t fit that of a dwarf.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Anor shook their heads, while Crockta avoided eye contact. They ignored him and tried to enter the inn.\u00a0</span><span>Then the dwarf opened his mouth to say,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGoing to Geherad will be useless.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s party stopped walking.</span></p><br/><p><span>The dwarf said,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThe one you are looking for isn\u2019t there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at the dwarf. He seemed to already know the purpose of Crockta\u2019s group.\u00a0</span><span>Perhaps he knew about Hedor.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta asked,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Do you know Hedor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHedor?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The dwarf was confused.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt is the first time I\u2019ve heard that name. I don\u2019t know who he is, but he won\u2019t be enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The momentary conversation paused. What was the dwarf talking about?\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s group looked at each other.\u00a0</span><span>Something was strange.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta spoke again,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou said that you know why we are going to Geherad...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat do you think the reason is?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The dwarf seemed to have noticed something was strange as he pointed to Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cAren\u2019t you going to fix that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you talking about? Fix?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are heading to Geherad without knowing anything?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The dwarf sighed.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cFoolish warrior!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat are you saying? Please explain.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo tugged at Crockta and Anor\u2019s sleeves.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIgnore him <em>dot</em>. He is just a weird dwarf, a crazy dwarf.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy mind is fine, gnome with an undignified expression!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat <em>dot</em>! Crazy dwarf!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor gently stopped Tiyo. The dwarf sighed,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou really don\u2019t know anything. Warrior. Listen carefully.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He pointed to Ogre Slayer on Crockta\u2019s back.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYour weapon is on the brink of breaking.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes widened. Then he reflexively grabbed the handle of Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>It felt heavy in his hands.\u00a0</span><span>That dwarf said that Ogre Slayer was on the verge of breaking down. There was a problem with the work of the Golden Anvil Clan?\u00a0</span><span>Crockta couldn\u2019t believe it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are a great warrior. I can feel it. You might\u2019ve become stronger through many battlefields, but the sword has continued to be damaged.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He had a point.\u00a0</span><span>Ever since Crockta received this as a gift from Thompson in Anail, he hadn\u2019t changed weapons even once.\u00a0</span><span>In the meantime, he had dealt with countless monsters and enemies. A conventional weapon would\u2019ve already been destroyed.\u00a0</span><span>However, Crockta had always taken care of Ogre Slayer and brought it to blacksmiths. Yet a shabby dwarf was saying this to him out of nowhere, so he couldn\u2019t accept it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI entrusted it to a blacksmith every time a fight ended.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, you left it to a blacksmith. That is the problem.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow come?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAn ordinary blacksmith can\u2019t handle Ogre Slayer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes widened. This dwarf knew that the greatsword was named Ogre Slayer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta held Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>The dwarf nodded fearlessly at the blade which Crockta held. There was a faint smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am a craftsman of the Golden Anvil Clan, Zakiro.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a member of the Golden Anvil Clan.\u00a0</span><span>However, this wasn\u2019t the end.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am the one who created Ogre Slayer, the Slayer Maker.\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour Majesty. This divine message is strange.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Duke Christian said.\u00a0</span><span>He was the one who had caused the emperor to become close to the Heaven and Earth Clan. He was also the one with the greatest power in the empire, maybe even more than the emperor.\u00a0</span><span>The kingdom could become an empire due to Duke Christian manipulating it from behind.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>After the Heaven and Earth Clan disappeared, Duke Christian rarely left his estate. However, he came to Akantor after hearing news about the divine message.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPlease think carefully.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI followed your cautious words and lost most of the troops.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Akantor said sarcastically.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, Christian wasn\u2019t agitated.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt was Your Majesty\u2019s choice to strike Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you really saying that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Christian shot back.\u00a0</span><span>Emperor Akantor... The only person able to question him was Duke Christian.</span></p><br/><p><span>Akantor\u2019s lips twisted as he smiled,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYes, let\u2019s say that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI believe you understand my point.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo, I should refuse the temples.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe empire isn\u2019t a place ruled by the gods. It is only Your Majesty who can decide on war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou speak well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI have always been loyal. Please listen to me, Your Majesty.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo, what is wrong with this? I don\u2019t know about matters regarding the gods. But this is an opportunity to get rid of Crockta who insulted the empire, as well as the dirty orcs. Does the duke think otherwise?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Christian closed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Of course, it was a tempting offer.\u00a0</span><span>In addition to the empire, all the species on the continent, including the elves and dwarves, had received this divine message.\u00a0</span><span>If they joined together, they could destroy the orcs without much damage. If Crockta was killed, the empire\u2019s fallen honor would be rebuilt.\u00a0</span><span>However, they needed to be careful.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMogsulin was at the fight on the plains.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI heard he was watching from a distance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Mogsulin was the magician who had stopped Crockta and saved Keynes. He was the genius who was the most powerful magician in the empire, and Duke Christian\u2019s most beloved follower.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe can borrow the power of the gods. Therefore, he has a great deal of knowledge about the gods.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA magician who can borrow the power of the gods?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe has the ability to interact with them. Anyway, he felt something at that time and learned that the gods were watching Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Mogsulin had sensed a power that shouldn\u2019t be present in Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is why the gods are trying to kill Crockta and the orcs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is that power?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe power of the fallen god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is the first time I\u2019ve heard of it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is dangerous. We must be cautious as long as the power of the fallen god is involved. She is the worst being who drove the world to the brink of destruction.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Christian gazed at Akantor with serious eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Akantor sighed.\u00a0</span><span>Christian was the real power of the empire. Simultaneously, he was his mother\u2019s brother, or in other words, his uncle.\u00a0</span><span>His strength was manipulation, but sometimes he gave sincere advice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen shouldn\u2019t we do something before the situation worsens?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe will have no obligation to.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIsn\u2019t the world in danger because of Crockta and the orcs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour Majesty is still pure.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Christian laughed. Akantor\u2019s face distorted.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if it is dangerous. The orcs live in the northwest of the continent. The elves, dwarves, and gnomes will receive the damage first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen when the time comes, the gods will come out in person. They leave troublesome things to the mortals, but once the damage is too large, they will use their power.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Akantor nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThe gods\u2026 It seems like a distant story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey are insignificant. They are merely mighty beings who call themselves gods and follow their own desires.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo, you\u2019re saying we don\u2019t need to exhaust our strength and should just watch. If nothing happens, it is good. If the other species are damaged, it is beneficial to us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Christian looked at Akantor with gentle eyes.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cKeep this in mind. There is no joint responsibility in this world. A battle is divided between the loser and the winner. In this case, there is no loss from not participating.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Akantor nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>Once Christian thought the emperor was convinced, he bowed and left the room.\u00a0</span><span>Now that Akantor was alone, he rubbed his chin.\u00a0</span><span>Christian\u2019s words made sense.\u00a0</span><span>However, it was clear that Christian had failed to grasp the power of the \u2018gods.\u2019 The gods weren\u2019t so convenient to deal with.</span></p><br/><p><span>Akantor muttered,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI wish it was that easy...\u201d</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

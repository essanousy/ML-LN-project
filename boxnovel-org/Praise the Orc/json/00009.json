As they walked towards Orcrox Fortress, Ian and Grom looked at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cToday...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Shall we call it a day?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, it\u2019s late.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Right now, it was dawn in reality.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe finally had an adventure in the game.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right. Thanks to Ian, I think my life as an orc is going well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom thanked him. Without Ian, he wouldn\u2019t have been able to complete this quest, and would\u2019ve died.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTomorrow as well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, if nothing happens.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen let\u2019s meet again tomorrow.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian and Grom smiled and bumped fists. Within a moment, their appearances blurred as their connection to Elder Lord was terminated.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Boss-nim, did something good happen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"No, does it look that way?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, you keep smiling. Did you get a girlfriend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian smiled at the inquiry.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Look, there\u2019s the smile again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It\u2019s nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What? Something is strange...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian was thinking about his adventure with Grant and Grom. They got rid of the mutant wolf and formed a fierce relationship between men.\u00a0</span><span>A smile appeared as he recalled Grant\u2019s final blow to the werewolf and Simba\u2019s indomitable will against the wolves. Ian had completely fallen for the charms of Elder Lord and the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>He hummed as he imagined his next adventure.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Ian\u2019s phone rang.\u00a0</span><span>It was his little sister, Yiyu, who should've been listening to lectures at school at this time.\u00a0</span><span>What was so urgent that she would call him at this time?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, hello.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Oppa...!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Her voice was urgent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Oppa, you see...</span></i><i><span>Right now I am at...</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s face stiffened at Yiyu\u2019s following words.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>The police station.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...What for?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>That...</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Ian roughly heard the situation and took off his caf\u00e9 apron.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBoss-nim...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I need to go out for a while, so please look after this place alone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPlease.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian left the caf\u00e9.</span></p><br/><p><span>He got in his car and stepped on the accelerator, driving towards the police station close to Yiyu\u2019s university.\u00a0</span><span>Ian went inside and found Yiyu, who got up as she saw him.\u00a0</span><span>Her expression was grouchy. Ian hugged her.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you uninjured?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes... I\u2019m fine...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen it\u2019s okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian ruffled Yiyu\u2019s hair, causing her to quietly laugh.\u00a0</span><span>He turned his head and saw two men sitting down, both of their faces looking like a mess. One of them got up and greeted Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hello. I am Yiyu\u2019s friend, Park Jungtae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I've heard the story.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian shook hands with Park Jungtae.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"And there...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He looked at the man sitting apart from Park Jungtae.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat person?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He scowled at Ian and looked away.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian asked Yiyu, \"What exactly did he say to you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTo me? Just... let\u2019s have a meal today. Girls always agree when I promise to take them someplace expensive... He muttered.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian raised his eyebrows.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"So you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I stayed quiet, but Jungtae was next to me, and they ended up arguing...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Fists ended up flying.\u00a0</span><span>Park Jungtae bowed his head like he was ashamed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Who struck first?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Almost at the same time...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There were such moments.\u00a0</span><span>Just before a physical conflict, their eyes would meet and sparks would fly before they pounced at the same time.\u00a0</span><span>Looking at their faces, both of them seemed similar. It seemed like they thrashed around without actually knowing how to fight. There were no serious injuries or aftereffects.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian laughed as he looked at their faces.\u00a0</span><span>Yiyu poked Ian\u2019s side.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oppa, why are you laughing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They are truly kids. Still, I\u2019m glad that it wasn\u2019t a big deal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This isn\u2019t a big deal?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Nobody is dead or maimed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Please don't say such scary things, this is the police station. Won\u2019t Jungtae go to jail?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>An agreement would be reached by both sides.\u00a0</span><span>Ian looked at the men.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The words he said to you... As a senior, is he usually like that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Sometimes...he flirts, but I don\u2019t care. It isn\u2019t uncommon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian raised his eyebrows, causing Yiyu to laugh this time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat? Don\u2019t you know that I get several phone numbers from men whenever I go outside? Right, Park Jungtae?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUh...well...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Jungtae answered with a gloomy expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian started laughing.\u00a0</span><span>So that\u2019s what happened.</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Jungtae and the other man were fighting over Yiyu. The level of injuries were similar, so it was likely to end with a mutual agreement. That\u2019s why the police officers cleared a space for them to talk.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian told Park Jungtae, \"You fought because of Yiyu, so thank you. Still, in the future, don\u2019t swing your fists, even if there is an argument.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes... I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf that senior continues to bother you, then contact me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He handed Park Jungtae his business card.\u00a0</span><span>Park Jungtae\u2019s eyes widened as he saw the name \u2018Caf\u00e9 Reason.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, are you the boss here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. Do you know of it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I heard the girls saying good things... The boss...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Park Jungtae smiled at Ian and continued, \"He is kind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Come visit sometime.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, there was a disturbance in the police station.</span></p><br/><p><span>A middle-aged man was walking this way. </span><span>There was oil on his face and he yelled as he walked, \u201cWhere is Sangho? Sangho! Yang Sangho!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian had a bad feeling.\u00a0</span><span>The senior who fought Park Jungtae over Yiyu stood up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYang Sangho! Hey, you stupid fool. Why did you get beaten up? You\u2019re a disgrace to my name.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFather...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, where is your opponent? Is it you?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He pointed to Park Jungtae.\u00a0</span><span>\"You were hit by this child... Aish, you screw up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What was it about? This woman?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s eyebrows twitched.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well, you both hit each other, so we can come to a mutual agreement. No, will that be enough? Should I call the police commissioner?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The middle-aged man bragged as he raised his phone.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is that your guardian over there? That baby? Or that woman? Is that young man related to you? No parents?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, the police officer in charge came back. His expression was heavy due to the disturbance.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oh, Guardian-nim. Please sit there quietly...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I should be quiet? I am a busy guy, yet I came all the way here, got it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Calm down, yes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian, who was watching the scene, knocked on Yiyu\u2019s back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Go back to school.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOppa?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will handle it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStill...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t you know that you won\u2019t receive your allowance if you\u2019re absent from school?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'll take care of Jungtae, so go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu nodded. However, she couldn\u2019t help looking at the middle-aged man with an uneasy expression. Ian placed his hand on Yiyu\u2019s head and grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cJung Yiyu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don't you know that I can solve things?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s right.</span></p><br/><p><span>Her brother, Jung Ian, always solved her problems, no matter what happened.</span></p><br/><p><span>When she was a child, she told Ian that children were harassing her, and they became quiet after a few days. Ian found her lost items and cooked whatever she wanted to eat.</span></p><br/><p><span>After their parents passed away, she was uneasy about their inherited debt. However, Ian just smiled and told her to believe in him, and he dealt with it all alone. He became a soldier and paid off the debt, providing her living expenses and paying for her university tuition fees.</span></p><br/><p><span>Seven years later, when he returned to South Korea, Ian was unchanged.\u00a0</span><span>He always solved her problems reliably.\u00a0</span><span>That was why Yiyu was forced to nod.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOppa, thank you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf you want to thank me, help out at the caf\u00e9.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is too much. Don\u2019t you know that it\u2019s the exam period?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I hope you do well on the exams.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Look forward to it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian ruffled Yiyu\u2019s hair.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu said goodbye to Park Jungtae. Someone glanced at her as she left.\u00a0</span><span>It was the middle-aged man talking with someone over the phone.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why is that girl going? Isn\u2019t she involved?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cW-What is that look?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Jungtae was surprised.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s expression changed the moment that Yiyu disappeared.\u00a0</span><span>He seemed like someone who always smiled gently.\u00a0</span><span>That was the story he heard about Caf\u00e9 Reason\u2019s boss. A warm hearted man who was always smiling, making the customer feel stable the moment they saw Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>But that smile was erased the moment that Yiyu left.\u00a0</span><span>Now he looked like someone else.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018My brother, he was a soldier. He used to fight in the Middle East and Africa.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The words that Yiyu had said popped into his head. The conflicting images were now merging together.</span></p><br/><p><span>The middle-aged man cried out, \"You, you, why are you staring at me like that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t talk anymore.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you talking to me right now? Are you crazy? How old are you, you brat?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The police officer in charge said, \"Both of you, please calm down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Didn\u2019t you hear what that brat said to me? Your boss, who is it? Do you know who I am? I am someone who eats with the police commissioner, understand? Hey.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The middle-aged man searched through his wallet and pulled out his business card.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am a person who runs a company, you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A brat who doesn\u2019t even know shame.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian approached. As Ian looked down at the man, he flinched and dropped his business card.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t you know shame?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cY-y-you, this...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t you feel any shame when you look at your child?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Talking impolitely...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The police officer inserted himself between the two of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNow, now, calm down...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The police officer flinched. He easily pushed the middle-aged man, but Ian didn\u2019t budge. It felt like he was pushing against a large rock.\u00a0</span><span>The police officer glanced at Ian with surprise before sitting both of them down.</span></p><br/><p><span>The middle-aged man regained his bravery.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Call your boss here. Now, there\u2019ll be a lawsuit, instead of an agreement!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jungtae\u2019s face became pale.\u00a0</span><span>His situation at home wasn\u2019t good, so Jungtae hadn\u2019t told his parents. He had no knowledge of law and couldn\u2019t afford to proceed with a lawsuit.\u00a0</span><span>The middle-aged man seemed to have a lot of money. Just as he saw on TV, the middle-aged man would use an expensive lawyer and his connections to turn Jungtae\u2019s life upside down.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Ian said, \"Jungtae.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes Hyung.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'll resolve it, so don't worry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian picked up the business card that the middle-aged man dropped.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man was talking with someone on the phone. He was disguising his son as a victim and asking the person to solve it. The man made all sorts of promises like, let\u2019s play golf next time, he would buy them a drink etc. </span></p><br/><p><span>It was sickening.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou over there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian called out to the senior who fought with Jungtae over Yiyu.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The senior raised his head.\u00a0</span><span>It was an ambiguous expression. His belief in her father along with the shame of the situation appeared on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDid you apologize to Yiyu?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cApologize?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The senior looked down as he shook his head. Ian waited for his answer.</span></p><br/><p><span>Once he raised his head again, his face resembled his father who was oily and greedy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You should be prepared to bow deeply in apology, along with that brat.\u201d The senior exclaimed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian started laughing,\u00a0</span><span>\"That isn\u2019t pride.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What nonsense are you saying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are ashamed of your father, but have decided to follow his actions.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don't speak nonsense.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLook.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian pointed around. All the police officers and civilians had expressions of contempt on their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They are watching your father with that disgusted expression.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You asshole.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Later, those expressions will turn to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The middle-aged man finished his call and got up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you know who I just called? That person...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian ignored him and turned to the officer in charge. The police officer had a distressed expression on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was obviously disgusted at the actions of the powerful, but it was a world where innocent people would be sacrificed. A scenario where the student called Park Jungtae was in trouble was painted in his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Inspector-nim.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'll be back after a phone call.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The cop looked at Ian. He, the man who was the guardian of the girl who caused the fight, was consistently calm. He felt something dignified in that attitude.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He expected a possible reversal of the situation.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule: \u00a011 chapters a week.\u00a0Check out the posting days here.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

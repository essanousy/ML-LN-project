The thin moon made him the most sensitive. Darkness distracted the enemy\u2019s vision and hid his stature.</span></p><br/><p><span>He just needed his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was currently floating above the tent of the great chieftain, Calmahart.\u00a0</span><span>But the area still hadn\u2019t calmed down. Orcs were carrying food into Calmahart\u2019s tent. They were carrying an enormous amount of meat.\u00a0</span><span>Calmahart\u2019s overeating was good for Crockta. Digesting a lot of food required energy, so it inevitably made the brain sleepy. The body would become dull and dull bodies created gaps in battle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Not bad.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Once the orcs fell asleep, Crockta would descend from the carriage and hit Calmahart.\u00a0</span><span>The night was still young.</span></p><br/><p><span>The next space time movement of this pumpkin was at midnight. He still had some time.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta touched the surface of the pumpkin carriage. It was really a pumpkin and a pegasus made of translucent light pulled it.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was summoned by Jamero\u2019s \u2018Boundary Pumpkin.\u2019\u00a0</span><span>He used it and a pumpkin carriage suddenly appeared.\u00a0</span><span>It was a carriage that only appeared in Crockta\u2019s eyes and allowed him to infiltrate wherever he wanted without a sound.\u00a0</span><span>If there wasn\u2019t a restriction that only one person could use it, perhaps he would\u2019ve been able to pull off a greater surprise attack.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta carefully searched below.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a large army.\u00a0</span><span>It was the spectacular sight of many orcs camping together.\u00a0</span><span>If all those orcs appeared in the north, it would be impossible for the dark elves to handle them.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta reinforced how important this opportunity was.\u00a0</span><span>If he stabbed Calmahart in the heart here, maybe the war would be over. The origin of all this was Calmahart.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOne, two, three.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He confirmed the number of guards around Calmahart\u2019s tent. There weren\u2019t many due to Calmahart\u2019s \u00a0confidence.\u00a0</span><span>Warriors on patrol sometimes roamed, but overall, the defense was lax. They didn\u2019t expect a surprise attack at all.</span></p><br/><p><span>Of course, they were right.\u00a0</span><span>If it weren\u2019t for this mysterious artifact, Crockta would\u2019ve never reached here.\u00a0</span><span>It was a one person raid.</span></p><br/><p><span>The moon went behind a cloud.\u00a0</span><span>There was perfect darkness on the plains.\u00a0</span><span>The pumpkin started to descend gradually, according to Crockta\u2019s will. Gradually, the campsite of the orcs came closer.</span></p><br/><p><span>He occasionally heard the steps of the orc soldiers walking around.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta quietly added his own footsteps to the sounds.\u00a0</span><span>There was an orc soldier with his back to Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Step.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, the orc soldier looked around.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Spit.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Patter.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Blood spattered as the orc\u2019s head turned around.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta caught the falling head and eliminated the sound of impact. Once again, blood poured on him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then silence.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Step.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Crockta walked forward.\u00a0</span><span>There were three guards around at the tent. Crockta moved behind them in the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d an orc muttered while yawning. </span></p><br/><p><span>He had a halberd tied to his back.\u00a0</span><span>He never noticed as Crockta secretly approached.</span></p><br/><p><span>[The skill Infiltration (Common) has been acquired.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[You seem to be getting used to sneaking around? Your Infiltration skill has upgraded.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Shadow Infiltration (Rare) has been acquired.]</span></p><br/><p><span>He shut the message windows off.\u00a0</span><span>Then in the same manner, he cut the neck of the orc from behind.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc responded.\u00a0</span><span>He felt something and quickly twisted. However, he couldn\u2019t avoid it and most of his neck was cut.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuheeok...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His throat was cut and he couldn\u2019t shout properly.\u00a0</span><span>The orc looked up at Crockta with surprised eyes. Gradually, bubbles rose and the eyes became blurred.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta used his greatsword to completely separate the dangling head.</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc\u2019s eyes died.\u00a0</span><span>Now there was only one left.\u00a0</span><span>The remaining orc was completely asleep.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta didn\u2019t bother using the greatsword. Instead, he reached out his hands to the orc\u2019s neck and twisted.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Crunch.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The orc still seemed to be sleeping. There would\u2019ve been no pain.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNow it is starting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta muttered in a small voice.\u00a0</span><span>He stood directly before Calmahart\u2019s tent. Such a large tent was being used by only one person. It was as big as a building.\u00a0</span><span>The opponent wasn\u2019t easy, but Crockta wasn\u2019t an ordinary orc.</span></p><br/><p><span>His greatsword was crying. Crockta smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he took out a scroll and tore it.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Wide Area Silence Scroll (Essence) has been consumed.]</span></p><br/><p><span>He barely sensed it. It was like the invisible membrane enveloping the area. Now no sound would leak out.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta opened the tent.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The interior was bright.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a fire blazing in the middle of the tent. One side contained fearsome weapons such as axes, hammers, and halberds, while the other side had a tactical map showing the current march of the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta skimmed it. It wasn\u2019t significantly different from what the dark elves had figured out.\u00a0</span><span>At the end, there was a huge mass lying on the bed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart.\u00a0</span><span>He was lying beside a huge throne decorated with all types of bones. Just looking at him from a distance, Crockta could guess his size.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta felt sick and tired.\u00a0</span><span>That really was an orc.\u00a0</span><span>He seemed one head bigger than Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>There was an axe under the bed. It was a huge double edged axe that seemed to be his main weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta approached.\u00a0</span><span>Calmahart hadn\u2019t noticed anything yet as his breathing was still the same. His face twisted as if he was doing something terrible in his dreams.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta pulled out his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>He hadn\u2019t come here to fight or play around.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was an assassination.\u00a0</span><span>The sword descended.\u00a0</span><span>It was at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart raised his arm.\u00a0</span><span>He was wearing a steel guard on his forearm. It blocked Crockta\u2019s greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart\u2019s eyes tinged red.\u00a0</span><span>He laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stepped back.\u00a0</span><span>It had been just a hair away.\u00a0</span><span>How was he noticed?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is the first time that I\u2019ve seen you. I would remember someone with tattoos.\"\u00a0</span><span>Calmahart got up.</span></p><br/><p><span>His huge body looked down at Crockta. His head seemed to reach the top of the tent.\u00a0</span><span>He grabbed his double edged axe.\u00a0</span><span>It was a huge weapon that wasn\u2019t inferior to Crockta\u2019s Ogre Slayer.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart looked down at Crockta. His expression was interested. His arms were trembling because he wanted to wield the double edged axe right away.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta caught his breath calmly.</span></p><br/><p><span>This had developed into a fight.\u00a0</span><span>He lifted Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>Anyway, he had been expecting this.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart and Crockta, the two orcs stood facing each other.\u00a0</span><span>Then their worlds slowed.\u00a0</span><span>Extremely keen senses.\u00a0</span><span>A sudden exchange of attack and defense occurred in a short amount of time.\u00a0</span><span>Ogre Slayer and the axe hit each other.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kakakaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuhuhu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The two looked at each other and laughed.\u00a0</span><span>And at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span>Strong.\u00a0</span><span>With that exchange, they were able to gauge the other person\u2019s level.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta plunged in. He aimed the sword at Calmahart\u2019s lower body. At the same time, Calmahart\u2019s axe lowered.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta twisted his body to avoid the axe and corrected the sword\u2019s trajectory.\u00a0</span><span>The blade swung into Calmahart\u2019s abdomen. Ogre Slayer bounced off.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuhuhu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart grinned. He was wearing steel armor on the inside.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Shall we do it properly?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He stretched his back. Then he approached Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, let\u2019s do it right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At the same time, huge momentum burst out from their bodies. A storm raged into the tent.\u00a0</span><span>The two of them grinned at each other. Then they fought again.\u00a0</span><span>At a speed that wasn\u2019t visible, they aimed their weapons at the other\u2019s neck and heart.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tremendously loud sounds like a thunderstorm occurred. Crockta became bruised while blood flowed from Calmahart\u2019s body.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Once again, their weapons collided. The power struggle continued.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta kicked Calmahart\u2019s legs.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuhuk!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart fell over, causing the tent to shake fiercely.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta jumped forward and aimed his greatsword downwards. Calmahart hit the greatsword with the axe and grabbed Crockta\u2019s neck with the other hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuock...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a strong grip on his neck. Crockta struggled. Calmahart smiled and gave more strength to his hands.\u00a0</span><span>It was a tremendous force.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grabbed the wrist and tried to pull it away, but it didn\u2019t move.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Crockta bit the hand with a wicked expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuaack!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart screamed and let go. One finger was tattered.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta smiled and spat out the blood.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThere isn\u2019t much taste.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart\u2019s eyes turned red with anger as he laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cKuhuhuhuk, kuhuhut!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This guy was for real.\u00a0</span><span>He was someone who knew how to really fight.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart\u2019s mouth rose.\u00a0</span><span>A warrior like himself, who knew what slaughter and fighting for their lives were.\u00a0</span><span>This guy knew.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d Calmahart asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta placed the greatsword on his shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see. You...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart remembered what happened earlier in the day.</span></p><br/><p><span>A real orc.\u00a0</span><span>Calmahart laughed.\u00a0</span><span>A real warrior would appear and kill him.\u00a0</span><span>The name was Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>An orc who was stronger and larger than average orcs. His eyes were deep and sharp. He wore a red headband and steel belt at his waist. The big greatsword used as a weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span>Strong.\u00a0</span><span>An orc who reached the same \u2018stage\u2019 as him.</span></p><br/><p><span>And...</span></p><br/><p><span>That was all.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are a real orc...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed.\u00a0</span><span>He had also seen what happened during the day.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What is a real orc, Calmahart?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart raised his axe.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStrong.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The axe contained a fearsome momentum. His muscles swelled up. The originally large body became even bigger.\u00a0</span><span>\"Stronger than anyone else. That is an orc.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He approached Crockta, who pulled out his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"And I am the strongest,\u201d declared Calmahart.</span></p><br/><p><span>At the same time, the axe lowered.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Swaaaack!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Space was severed.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes changed. It was an unusual attack. Crockta immediately moved to the side to avoid it.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kaaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The axe struck a part of the skull protruding from his belt.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta lost his balance in the aftermath and fell to one knee. He rolled to avoid the next strike from the axe.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The Demon\u2019s Mouth was scratched.\u00a0</span><span>This was the first time.</span></p><br/><p><span>He raised his head. The axe was coming in succession.\u00a0</span><span>Instead of stepping back, Crockta bowed his head and moved forward.\u00a0</span><span>The axe passed over Crockta\u2019s head. The oversized Calmahart was bent down low and defenseless against Crockta\u2019s incoming rush.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta aimed his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuheok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Blood emerged from Calmahart\u2019s mouth.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta twisted his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>But the handle didn\u2019t move.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart\u2019s abdominal muscles held on to the blade.</span></p><br/><p><span>He couldn\u2019t believe it.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta raised his head. Calmahart was smiling as he looked down at Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I got you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart threw the axe away and grabbed Crockta\u2019s neck with both hands.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta desperately pulled his greatsword but it didn\u2019t budge.\u00a0</span><span>What a monstrous body.</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart laughed. Crockta\u2019s eyes became blurry as he looked up into Calmahart\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Calmahart\u2019s grip became stronger.\u00a0</span><span>His consciousness faded.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he saw something shimmering on Calmahart\u2019s forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span>His consciousness went to a distant place.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!

I will check on Oppa\u2019s character as much as possible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was fortunate that many users were logged out to watch the war between the gods and the orcs. If the number of users was the same as normal, the situation would\u2019ve been several times more serious.\u00a0</span><span>The governments around the world appreciated Crockta\u2019s popularity.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe are actively cooperating with the broadcasting intermediaries. Don\u2019t worry too much. Experts from all over the world are analyzing Elder Lord\u2019s system. It will be resolved in the near future.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, it was a tragedy to the families of the victims.\u00a0</span><span>Most of them were emotional from the sudden situation, clutching onto the capsules and crying. A lot of energy was needed for the government workers to deal with them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Therefore, Kang Jungman admired the way this pretty girl reacted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is my business card. Please contact me if something happens.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kang Jungman checked the connection capsule.\u00a0</span><span>A life support device was connected to Jung Ian\u2019s body in the capsule, and everything was normal.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the early days of the incident, all those forcibly removed from the capsule had fallen into brain dead states. According to the doctors, everything had been normal except that it seemed like their soul had escaped.\u00a0</span><span>So, the government focused resources on maintaining the lives of the players, making it so they could survive in the world of Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>At present, it was a somewhat stable situation.\u00a0</span><span>As long as they didn\u2019t die in Elder Lord, their bodies would be fine.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...\u201d Kang Jungman paused as he was about to turn away.\u00a0</span><span>This was his last home visit for the day, and he had time to spare. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t normally say this.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCurrently, the government is sending psychologists for the family members. If you have any trouble, then please contact me. I will help you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu smiled faintly. \u201cYes, I will. Thank you for your consideration.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen I\u2019ll be going now,\u201d Kang Jungman said and</span><span>\u00a0left the house.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The government agent left, and the door closed behind him.\u00a0</span><span>Yiyu sat on the couch and stared at the door of the room which contained Ian. There were many thoughts running through her mind, making her head heavy.</span></p><br/><p><span>She leaned back and reflected on a scene.\u00a0</span><span>It was a memory of the past, from their childhood. There had been many situations when her brother, Ian, hadn\u2019t been present.</span></p><br/><p><span>The first time she had been apart from her friends. After her parents died, she had been left at her relative\u2019s house, and her cousins had bullied her. It had been the same back when she\u2019d been disappointed that she hadn\u2019t attained a good score, and she\u2019d gone drinking on the streets.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were situations when she\u2019d been in distress.\u00a0</span><span>However, she always had a strange assurance that the problems would eventually pass. It was an odd faith, believing nothing could harm her.</span></p><br/><p><span>Funnily enough, she was never truly disappointed.\u00a0</span><span>Despite the unrealistic situation in which her brother was trapped in the game, calmness sank deep into her heart.\u00a0</span><span>Why...?</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu thought about it.\u00a0</span><span>If she looked into her heart, she would someday reach the source of the emotion. She wondered about it idly and suddenly realized...\u00a0</span><span>It was because he was her brother.\u00a0</span><span>He had always stood behind her.</span></p><br/><p><span>Her brother, Jung Ian, had never disappointed her. Whenever she experienced difficulties, Ian had always come up with an answer.\u00a0</span><span>Her faith was irrational, but Ian had always responded to her expectations. Therefore, that blindness was natural. He had always given her a future.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the same now.\u00a0</span><span>Even in this surreal situation, she believed that Ian would come back without any hesitation.\u00a0</span><span>How?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow can I doubt him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>How could her brother, Jung Ian, always be so constant?\u00a0</span><span>Yiyu rose from her seat and walked to Ian\u2019s room.\u00a0</span><span>Ian was breathing deeply, like he was asleep. How was he coping with the situation in Elder Lord?</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu didn\u2019t panic.\u00a0</span><span>She looked around the room. Ian was like a soldier, prepared to leave at any time.\u00a0</span><span>Knowing this, she swept a hand around on his desk and suddenly opened a drawer.\u00a0</span><span>There were a few letters inside the drawer.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were letters from a foreign country. Both the address and sender were in English. She removed the letters and read their contents.\u00a0</span><span>They had been sent from his old comrades.\u00a0</span><span>The letters contained stories which she couldn\u2019t understand.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Raven.\u2019 That\u2019s what they called Ian. There was one type of message repeated in their rambling messages.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Thank you.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[I\u2019m still alive thanks to you.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[I will repay the favor.]</span></p><br/><p><span>He had saved others even while his life had been at risk.\u00a0</span><span>How could her brother keep doing that? It wasn\u2019t simply because he\u2019d learned martial arts. Ian was strong and always sacrificed himself for everyone else.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu recalled one fact. It was a fact that she hadn\u2019t allowed to enter her consciousness.\u00a0</span><span>She and her brother weren\u2019t related by blood.\u00a0</span><span>Ian didn\u2019t know that she knew. She had happened to hear it while living at her relative\u2019s house.</span></p><br/><p><span>Why was Jung Ian so devoted to her, when they weren\u2019t even related by blood?\u00a0</span><span>...And why did she take it for granted?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don't know\u2026\u201d Yiyu sighed.\u00a0</span><span>She looked up at the ceiling. It was a plain white. She stared at it quietly, letting her confused mind turn into a sheet of white.\u00a0</span><span>However, an answer didn\u2019t emerge.</span></p><br/><p><span>Instead, Yiyu decided to ask when Ian came back.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho searched up \u2018Crockta\u2019 on the Internet.\u00a0</span><span>He scanned through countless pieces of information and found Crockta\u2019s latest move. Crockta, along with his companions, were heading toward the grey god in the north.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou...\u201d Baek Hanho leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>He remembered when he first met Jung Ian.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cHey Kid, are you fighting?\u201d He actually spoke to Ian for another reason.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>At the time, the small Jung Ian was dragging the body of a dead dog. The destination was a flowerbed.\u00a0</span></i><i><span>He didn\u2019t stop his feet while he thought about burying the body somewhere.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cAre you struggling?\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Ian shook his head regardless of whether he was struggling or not. Baek Hanho smiled and followed the little boy.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cKid. What are you doing now?\u201dBaek Hanho asked.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Then Ian answered bluntly, \u201cI'm going to bury the dog.\"</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cDid you kill it?\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cNope. It was already dead.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cThen why are you doing this?\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>It wasn\u2019t a child\u2019s responsibility to get rid of the bodies of dead animals.\u00a0</span></i><i><span>So, Ian\u2019s reply was unexpected. \u201cSomebody has to.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Ian didn\u2019t have to be that someone, but this kid said it was what he had to do.\u00a0</span></i><i><span>As Ian dropped the dog\u2019s body and started digging, Baek Hanho wondered what type of brain this kid had. So, he just watched from behind.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>The little boy placed the dog\u2019s body into the flower bed and dusted off his hands. It was a face which seemed to express that this situation wasn\u2019t serious.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Baek Hanho said, \u201cKid.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cYes,\u201d the little boy responded. </span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cJung Ian.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\"Ian...\u201d\u00a0</span></i><i><span>It was a good name.\u00a0</span></i><i><span>\u201cWhat are you most worried about now?\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cWorried?\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cYes. I\u2019ll resolve it for you.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cMister can\u2019t do that.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cTell me. I can help you.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Ian looked at Baek Hanho and opened his mouth. \u201cI have a little sister...\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cWhat about her?\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know how to protect my sister.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cI am her older brother, so I have to protect her for the rest of her life.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Baek Hanho was speechless for a moment.\u00a0</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>He learned a secret killing technique.\u00a0</span></i><i><span>His mentor had always said, \u2018The successor of this martial art should be someone with a righteous mind and is able to understand the burden of responsibility. Such a mind is so rare that it is like a precious gem.\u2019</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cKid, did you say you were called Ian?\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>\u201cI will let you know what you should do to protect your sister.\u201d</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Ian\u2019s expression was one of confusion.\u00a0</span></i><i><span>Baek Hanho smiled and looked at the kid who would become his disciple.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t shine yet.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>That day, he had found the gem his teacher had talked about.\u00a0</span><span>The disciple had been young, but the tempering of his nature was already complete. Therefore, Baek Hanho had done his best to teach the martial art without breaking that straight mind.</span></p><br/><p><span>His disciple, Ian, had always met his expectations.</span></p><br/><p><span>...Just like now.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFighting...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho knew about the present situation in detail.\u00a0</span><span>He had also traveled around the world in his youth and used the relationships he\u2019d developed to learn the truth that the government wanted to hide.</span></p><br/><p><span>Albino had already been dismantled.\u00a0</span><span>The interior had been exposed using a laser cutting machine.\u00a0</span><span>However, after that...</span></p><br/><p><span>It was empty.\u00a0</span><span>Albino, which they believed to be the core system, was just an empty sphere.\u00a0</span><span>No one could tell how Elder Lord was being maintained and why people weren\u2019t waking up.\u00a0</span><span>There was nothing to study, so even the best experts couldn\u2019t find anything. The incident was close to a supernatural phenomenon.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was only one informal solution.\u00a0</span><span>As the system said, it was to defeat the grey god.\u00a0</span><span>They didn\u2019t know Albino\u2019s identity, if it was an artificial intelligence or something else. However, Albino never lied.</span></p><br/><p><span>Therefore, the last quest window which popped up must be true.\u00a0</span><span>That was the only method they could think of.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou\u2019ve done it before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian was moving towards this unique path.\u00a0</span><span>Elder Lord\u2019s strongest warrior, Crockta...</span></p><br/><p><span>Baek Hanho closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>He hadn\u2019t worried much back when Ian became a mercenary in a conflict zone through his introduction.\u00a0</span><span>Now looking back, it was a strange thing. No matter how talented Ian was, he was a man who would die if stabbed or shot. However, Baek Hanho always believed that Ian would return.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian was such a person.\u00a0</span><span>He had always responded to the faith others placed in him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t want to raise a new disciple at this age...\u201d Baek Hanho muttered and closed the Internet window.</span></p><br/><p><span>When Ian came back, Baek Hanho would urge him to quickly take on a disciple.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Han Yeori felt restless.\u00a0</span><span>She didn\u2019t know much about games, but the whole world was in a state of confusion due to Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>Additionally, the boss hadn\u2019t appeared for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span>According to Ian\u2019s sister, Ian had left Korea for a while due to an urgent matter. However, Ian wasn\u2019t the type to disappear without saying anything.\u00a0</span><span>Ian had recently told her that he was playing Elder Lord, so she might be caught in this situation. However, she shook her head. Han Yeori comforted herself by saying it wasn\u2019t possible.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnni. It is good to have no customers,\u201d Yoo Sooyeon said with a laugh. </span></p><br/><p><span>Han Yeori smiled. \u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI wish it was usually like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the door opened.\u00a0\u00a0</span><span>The two chatting employees straightened their backs and greeted the customer, \u201cWelcome. This is Cafe Reason.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a man with tanned skin and wearing sunglasses on his head.\u00a0\u00a0</span><span>He walked towards the counter of the cafe and said, \u201cThe store is cute.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHaha, thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat isn\u2019t necessary. Girl, you aren\u2019t the boss. Where is he?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh\u2026 Boss-nim isn\u2019t here at the moment...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed, I asked for no reason.\u201d The man seemed to know Ian well.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe boss...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He glanced at Han Yeori\u2019s name tag and said, \u201cHe praises you quite a lot. Apparently, you make good coffee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. So, could you make me a cup of coffee? A delicious one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou can pick. I don\u2019t know about coffee.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man sat down in the middle of the cafe and looked around, getting a feel of the atmosphere.\u00a0</span><span>Once the coffee was made, he went to pick it up and asked Han Yeori, \u201cGirl, how is the boss here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat type of person is he?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShouldn\u2019t you know?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI know. That is why I am asking.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUh...\u201d Han Yeori was confused by this person.\u00a0</span><span>Then she thought about it.\u00a0</span><span>What type of person was Ian?</span></p><br/><p><span>She remembered the first time she met him.\u00a0</span><span>Cafe Reason hadn\u2019t advertised on the Internet. There had just been a sign saying, \u2018Help Wanted,\u2019 on the window of the store.\u00a0</span><span>At that time, Han Yeori had been experiencing various difficulties. So, when she saw the sign, she had opened the cafe door desperately.</span></p><br/><p><span>It had a shabby interior and felt like it would fall apart at any moment.\u00a0</span><span>However, there was a man with a kind smile inside.\u00a0</span><span>When she said she had come in for the part-time job, he had immediately prepared a seat for her. They had sat facing each other in silence for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span>At the end of the silence, he had asked, \u201cDo you have a good smile?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a sudden question, so Han Yeori answered bluntly, \u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then she gave a big smile, the greatest smile she could make.\u00a0</span><span>Ian stared at her grinning face and replied, \u201cI accept.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>That had been it.\u00a0</span><span>Han Yeori had stared blankly for a while after hearing she had gotten accepted. However, it hadn\u2019t been because she was thrilled by the unexpected job.\u00a0</span><span>It had been due to the look in Ian\u2019s eyes when he laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>That had been her first meeting with him.\u00a0</span><span>Han Yeori finished thinking about it and looked at the customer in front of her.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBoss-nim...\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span>When she could hardly speak, the man spoke again, \u201cIs he a good person?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, he is. Really.\u201d There was no word more appropriate than that. Han Yeori smiled and nodded. \u201cA good person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI think so as well.\u201d The man sipped the coffee and said, \u201cThis coffee is really delicious. Thank you. I hope the boss comes back soon. Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes...\u201d Han Yeori stopped for a moment as she thought about Ian.\u00a0</span><span>What was he doing now?</span></p><br/><p><span>Somehow, Ian\u2019s uncomfortable expression came to mind. She said with a smile, \u201cI wish he will return quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p>The raws of Praise the Orc! has officially been completed at 228 chapters.</p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

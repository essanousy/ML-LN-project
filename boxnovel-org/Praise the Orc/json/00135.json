He was going to quickly finish the contract, but the people had disappeared. If this happened, he wouldn\u2019t take a step back.</span></p><br/><p><span>He asked a ticket employee at the Opera Stadium. \"Where are the people who were lending money here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The employee looked at Tito and shrugged.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. They are always wandering around somewhere. I\u2019m not that familiar with you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I thought you knew them </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don't know. I just told people who needed money about them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you know the place where they usually hang out </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don't know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo was troubled and tried to take the questioning further, but other guests showed up for their tickets, forcing him to take a step back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUmm...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo was confused.\u00a0</span><span>\"Well, I suppose it doesn't really matter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It wasn\u2019t his fault they weren\u2019t in the spot. Tiyo left without paying back the loan. He would give them the money the next day.</span></p><br/><p><span>There are still a lot of work left to do in Quantes. This time, he was planning to take Anor to Quantes Academy. The professors would love it if he told them about the life and history of the north, together with Anor.</span></p><br/><p><span>The north would soon be opened, so if they shared a lot of information, Quantes could cope better.\u00a0</span><span>He was from the Quantes Gnomes Garrison. He was a soldier who always worried about Quantes\u2019 future.</span></p><br/><p><span>He called out to Anor, who was watching the street performances. The tall dark elf with brown skin stood out among the gnomes.\u00a0</span><span>He was engrossed in a puppet show.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anor, let\u2019s go</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDid you pay back the money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I didn\u2019t see them</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>. Where did they go...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"So you still owe them?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How can I pay it back if no one is there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...\u201dAnor frowned and started to ponder something. \"In other words, if you can\u2019t pay it today, the interest rate will increase.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is ridiculous</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>. I tried to pay them back, but they weren\u2019t there!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTiyo is naive.\u201dAnor laughed. \"Living in a good city like this, you\u2019ve always seen good things and lived with good treatment...huhut.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you talking about? I have lived through hardship and adversity</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is different. I know a lot of the tricks since I was harassed. It was a method that strong people use against the weak. A method to extort others using force.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Indeed, you are the outcast of Nuridot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor huffed at Tiyo\u2019s remark, but he remained silent. He had come a long way. He had the self-control to not swear.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhu, it is true but it is annoying to hear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ohh...your self-control has increased </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor shrugged.\u00a0</span><span>\"In any case, you should be careful of those strange moneylenders. You say you can repay it, but if you don\u2019t, they might end up bothering your friends and family later.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Can they really bother my friends </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey don\u2019t know about Tiyo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I got it </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo wasn\u2019t very concerned.\u00a0</span><span>He was a captain of the highly respected Gnomes Garrison and a macho man, so he didn\u2019t think anyone in Quantes could harm him.</span></p><br/><p><span>They headed for the Academy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That reminds me, I got involved with Crockta at the Academy </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Did you meet there?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Indeed </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. There was a rough incident due to the belt that Crockta is currently wearing at his waist.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The Academy erected a monument for those who died because of the devastation caused by the Demon\u2019s Mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"So I met him and headed north, now we are heading to the south together. Life is truly unpredictable </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right. I thought I would spend my whole life in Nuridot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta changed numerous things. They looked forward to how the future would change.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo raised his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s Ogre Slayer flew.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Kenzo had the foreboding feeling that he would die again. It was a speed that couldn\u2019t be avoided. He couldn\u2019t avoid the big sword even if he twisted his body.\u00a0</span><span>He would die again.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo released the power in his body. Then he stared blankly at the sword aiming for him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Somehow, time slowed down. He could clearly see the shape of the blade flying towards him.\u00a0</span><span>It was a well-made sword. He could see everything from the blade that shone in the midday sun, as well as Crockta\u2019s eyes staring at him.</span></p><br/><p><span>What was happening?</span></p><br/><p><span>He moved his body.\u00a0</span><span>It felt like his body escaped from under Crockta\u2019s blade. He could feel it slipping away from the trajectory of the greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>Maybe he would be able to counterattack. He twisted and wielded his claymore. It felt like the claymore would cross the gap made by Ogre Slayer and hit Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Peeok!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\"Ouch!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He thought so, but Crockta\u2019s Ogre Slayer had moved again and struck him. He fell.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Heok, heok.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are developing. Good.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\"I have to leave soon. I hope you can quickly enter the realm that I told you about earlier.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The area called the Pinnacle.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo didn\u2019t say it but he already knew about the Pinnacle rating. It was basic knowledge that most users had already figured out. But he didn\u2019t know how to reach such a profound state.\u00a0</span><span>If he looked at his skills, they were at the Essence and Rare rank, both below the Pinnacle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kenzo.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon't forget. Once you reach the Pinnacle, you have to listen to my words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta had one condition.\u00a0</span><span>After becoming strong enough to reach the Pinnacle, he had to listen to one thing that Crockta said.\u00a0</span><span>Of course, that was on the premise that it was possible for Kenzo. As long as it was possible, he would listen to Crockta\u2019s will.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo gladly accepted. After training with Crockta, he was able to get a glimpse of the realm of the Pinnacle. By the time he reached that realm, he was confident that he would become a ranker.\u00a0</span><span>If so, this price wasn\u2019t too much to pay.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anything. I will surely do it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood.\u201d Crockta nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment he was about to raise his sword again, \"Hey! Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo\u2019s voice was heard.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Kenzo turned their heads at the same time, with the latter\u2019s eyes wiggled.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Kenzo were in a vacant lot on the outskirts of Quantes so Tiyo was the one giving Anor the tour. And Tiyo had done his job properly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Look</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>! This guy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Who is this young man? Perhaps...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Indeed </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! This guy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A handsome young man stood in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is that timid cursing fool </span><i><span>dot!</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor\u2019s bushy hair was now neatly arranged with his black hair neatly covering his forehead. The two clear eyes beneath them were shining brightly.\u00a0</span><span>In addition, he wasn\u2019t wearing his shabby clothing from the north, but had changed into the continent\u2019s clothing that combined practicality and fashion.</span></p><br/><p><span>Indeed. The species of beauty, an elf descendant! If this was reality, he would easily be able to become a celebrity.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is a saying that clothes are wings. Now, the last point </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo threw something towards Anor. Anor grabbed it and placed it on his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a gray robe that didn\u2019t look much different from his previous one.\u00a0</span><span>The previous handsome appearance of the dark elf had disappeared, leaving a dark necromancer whose face couldn\u2019t be seen properly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow is it, not bad </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhuhuhu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor\u2019s laughter emerged from the shadow of the hood.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kukukuk...I am the necromancer Anor...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"My fashion sense saved Anor </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I was suspicious when you bought strange clothes but...this robe is spectacular. Kukuk...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am also a trend setter. Tiyo sets the fashion in Quantes. Hihihit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta wanted to say that it wasn\u2019t the case. \"That...just take off the robe...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They just sniffed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta is ignorant about fashion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ignore Crockta </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>What should he do with this dark elf and gnome duo? Crockta sighed.\u00a0</span><span>Still, Kenzo who had the fashion sense of a modern man, whispered in a small voice, +\"People with strange fashion senses always think it is great. Please understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>How long had it been since he experienced common sense?\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked at Kenzo.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo smiled and raised his thumb. Crockta nodded and placed an arm around Kenzo\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are truly a man who can learn from me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huhuhu, no.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a Japanese person also interested in fashion. The fashion style in Japan wasn\u2019t always popular either.</span></p><br/><p><span>Once the situation was cleared up, they decided to have a meal together.\u00a0</span><span>They planned to eat at a famous restaurant in Quantes in order to give Anor a taste of the delicious dishes of the continent.\u00a0</span><span>They headed to the well-known restaurant \u2018Quantes\u2019 Healthy Kitchen\u2019, located in Quantes Square. It was famous for its charismatic chef.</span></p><br/><p><span>By the way, Anor discovered something strange near the restaurant.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I didn\u2019t know the price would go up so suddenly...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is okay. We are happy to help.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I just need to pay you back?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Of course. Hahahahat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He saw a group of humans and gnomes. It was the same as before, but the humans were watching from behind.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The interest rate will be high, but it won\u2019t be a problem if you pay it back quickly. Hahahat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you. I don\u2019t want to be yelled at by my new girlfriend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am rooting for your love.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor looked at them closely.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was obvious based on the contents of the conversation. Unscrupulous moneylenders had started setting up root in Quantes. It wasn\u2019t noticeable now, but they would eventually become a huge problem to Quantes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you doing </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>? Quickly!\u201d Tiyo called out to him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m coming.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor forgot about telling Tiyo as he entered the restaurant.\u00a0</span><span>The doors opened to reveal light from a beautiful chandelier. Below the chandelier were delicious dishes that stimulated his appetite.\u00a0</span><span>It was enough to make him forget what he just saw.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhoa!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor entered the restaurant.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I have to admit it.\u201dAnor wiped his mouth with a towel and said, \"The culture of the continent is awesome.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He had already eaten several honey pork dishes.\u00a0</span><span>His stomach seemed too big for his slim body. He reached out for another dish, despite the feeling that came from overeating.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"In particular, the food is great.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I think you ate too much.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. I\u2019m okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This time, Anor reached out for a chicken-stuffed-with-vegetables dish.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor were already unable to eat anymore.\u00a0</span><span>Anor struggled and swallowed his grape juice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That reminds me, I saw them again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Saw what </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The group of moneylenders. They were near the restaurant.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The expressions of the three people changed at Anor\u2019s words. Tiyo and Kenzo both looked suspicious. Meanwhile, Crockta grinned with interest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Good.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you saying </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ve found you a suitable opponent.\u201d Crockta looked at Kenzo and said, \"Kenzo.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The next training is a real life experience.\u201d Crockta pointed at Kenzo\u2019s claymore. \"With that Claymore, let them know the justice of Quantes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span>Those moneylenders, they were users.

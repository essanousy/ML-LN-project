Die! Die!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were two small throwing axes. It was the best tool for slaughtering in her hands.\u00a0</span><span>All the enemies around her were killed by the axes.\u00a0</span><span>She noticed the faces of those in the distance.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t run away and come here! I will play with you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She licked the blood on her cheek and giggled.\u00a0</span><span>Her shoulders trembled before she suddenly threw her axe. The backs of those running away were split.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you don\u2019t come then I will kill you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She kept on throwing her axes. They accurately hit the heads of the expedition soldiers.\u00a0</span><span>She laughed loudly,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cHahahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a frenzy suitable for the title of \u2018Mad Slaughterer.\u2019\u00a0</span><span>Her berserkers followed her.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Come on!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you don't want to die then kill us!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKakakakat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It didn\u2019t matter about the power of the gods or their morale. The berserkers stabbed, cut and slashed. Blood sprang from the wounds and they died.\u00a0</span><span>It was sufficient.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s go, Kids. Follow me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Understood!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>She took out a new axe from her waist.\u00a0</span><span>She turned it round and round, wondering who to kill next.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, the ground shook.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh my?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was coming from Kumarak\u2019s direction. She looked around.\u00a0</span><span>The earthquake wasn\u2019t the work of Kumarak. It was caused by the dwarf paladin that he was going against.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya examined them. Kumarak was bloody and barely standing. On the other hand, the dwarf fighting him was unfamiliar.\u00a0</span><span>He wielded the hammer towards Kumarak.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat, that person is a god?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The light around the dwarf was proof of a god\u2019s power.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I told you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She had never fought a god before. They were also hiding behind the temples, speaking a few condescending words and giving off a good impression.\u00a0</span><span>Those beings were coming down directly to get rid of the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How interesting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The dwarf wielded the hammer. Kumarak blocked with Destroyer but was thrown back from the shock.\u00a0</span><span>Anya felt somewhat uncomfortable as she looked at Kumarak on the ground.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStupid guy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kumarak was a powerful warrior.\u00a0</span><span>However, that strength he was so proud of was losing. The dwarf kicked the fallen orc.\u00a0</span><span>Anya spoke to her subordinates.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou fight here. I will be going somewhere for a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She jumped forward. She trampled and killed the soldiers in her way.\u00a0</span><span>Her goal was Kumarak.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKumarak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, her voice didn\u2019t reach.\u00a0</span><span>Kumarak ran towards the dwarf again. He looked terrible but he didn\u2019t lose his fighting spirit. Rather, he wielded Destroyer with crazy eyes.\u00a0</span><span>The hammer and axe collided. Kumarak and the dwarf glared at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kumarak suddenly swung his fist. It hit the dwarf\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span>The dwarf\u2019s face distorted and he swung his fist as well. Kumarak\u2019s teeth were broken.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGrrung!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kumarak swung his fists again.\u00a0</span><span>Thus, they continued punching each other. It was a struggle against a god.\u00a0</span><span>They dropped their weapons and tangled together. Kumarak\u2019s fighting spirit was contagious as the god cried out in a loud voice.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKumarakkk! I will kill you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Come on, Tartatod! God of the worms!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tartatod.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya understood the whole situation.\u00a0</span><span>Kumarak had smashed a mountain and killed the great worm, gaining the title of \u2018Mountain Smasher.\u2019\u00a0</span><span>So this god must be Tartatod, the one who loved those who dug under the ground. He appeared in front of Kumarak to get revenge for Almutad.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe gods are the same as us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya\u2019s mouth twitched.</span></p><br/><p><span>She didn\u2019t believe in those who called themselves gods. Look, they were no different from the creatures on the ground. How could she join her hands together and say a prayer when the god was shrieking and swinging his fists.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were just beings with mighty powers.\u00a0</span><span>Just that.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you going there to intervene?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Someone asked her.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya recoiled.\u00a0</span><span>A woman approached her. It was one of the rare elves who joined the expedition, wearing the clothing of a priest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You must face me first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a woman she had never seen before.\u00a0</span><span>Anya instantly knew who she was. She burst out laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhaha. You?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is an honor for a celebrity to look for me. Do you know how to fight?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The opponent smiled.\u00a0</span><span>A god who always showed mercy.\u00a0</span><span>The god everyone praise, who gave the powerful of healing and passed on teachings to help the poor.\u00a0</span><span>The goddess of mercy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are the most notable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is an honor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere is the blood of many on your hands.\u201d The goddess of mercy said.\u00a0</span><span>Mad Slaughterer Anya.\u00a0</span><span>She was in direct opposition to the goddess of mercy.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cNow it is time to stop the tragedies you created.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Stop the tragedies.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anya laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>She pointed to the battlefield.\u00a0</span><span>Orcs and expedition members were killing each other and dying.\u00a0</span><span>Both sides were engulfed in their own madness and didn\u2019t hesitate to attack. They wielded their weapons until they stopped breathing.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was pandemonium.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya continued, \"You also created this battlefield so you are just a hypocrite. If you combine all the things I\u2019ve done in my life, it will look like a comedy compared to the tragedy that you committed today.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The god\u2019s face shook before calming.</span></p><br/><p><span>Anya smiled.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped. Let\u2019s start quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kumarak\u2019s roar was heard from behind her.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"God, is it up to hereeeeeeeeeee\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then something exploded.\u00a0</span><span>It didn\u2019t stop there. The earth broke and collapsed. She didn\u2019t know where and how it happened, but there were screams from those caught up in the aftermath.\u00a0</span><span>Anya laughed as she twirled the two small axes in both hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t you have to help your friend soon?\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus limped.\u00a0</span><span>The hunter, hidden somewhere on the battlefield, continued to fire.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus also responded, but the opponent\u2019s shooting was faster and more accurate.</span></p><br/><p><span>It wasn\u2019t a large difference.\u00a0</span><span>However, it was the divide that separated life and death.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus gritted his teeth and bandaged the wound on his thigh. Even now, the enemy was still aiming at him. Zankus could feel the killing intent.</span></p><br/><p><span>Truly a god.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus didn\u2019t know what to do.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Dammit.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, he decided to borrow someone else\u2019s opinion.\u00a0</span><span>He closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>In the middle of the battlefield, an invisible hunter was aiming for his life. He stared at the darkness behind his eyelids.\u00a0</span><span>A man was standing there.</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan.\u00a0</span><span>The best hunter he knew, Shakan.\u00a0</span><span>In this moment of urgency, he only had the chance for one question.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus threw a question towards the man,\u00a0</span><span>\u2018How can I hunt this enemy?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan replied.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus\u2019 eyes opened.\u00a0</span><span>A light was heading towards him.\u00a0</span><span>It was quite close.\u00a0</span><span>Just before it hit his head...</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus twisted as an arrow grazed his cheek.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus muttered as he stared at where the light had come from, \u201cI understand, Shakan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he loaded an arrow. The iron was distorted.\u00a0</span><span>In the gap between the expedition troops, there was a shadow standing alone between flapping flags.</span></p><br/><p><span>That guy.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus fired an arrow.\u00a0</span><span>The shadow that fought with him disappeared, but the bodies of the expedition members nearby exploded.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus wasn\u2019t satisfied and quickly pursued the enemy with his next arrow.</span></p><br/><p><span>The arrow\u2019s tip aimed at the enemy\u2019s figure.\u00a0</span><span>He pulled back the bowstring as he recalled Shakan\u2019s answer.</span></p><br/><p><span>'You can\u2019t hunt him.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He borrowed the image of Shakan and asked for an answer.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus couldn\u2019t hunt down the enemy, as the other person was a better hunter than him.\u00a0</span><span>So he decided to give up hunting.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Today, I\u2019m not a hunter...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus\u2019 arrow went straight through some passing soldiers. The soldiers were killed. The knights who faced the orcs were caught in the aftermath. The knights were killed. The shield of a noble was pierced. The noble also died.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Today\u2026 I must be a killer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Soon after, his \u2018death shot\u2019 hit the enemy.\u00a0</span><span>He avoided a fatal wound, but it was unavoidable to receive a shallow hit.\u00a0</span><span>The enemy sat down and shook with hostility.\u00a0</span>However, he didn\u2019t die.</p><br/><p><span>\"You will die soon enough.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zankus laughed and aimed his arrow again.</span></p><br/><p><span>His title was \u2018Sun Killer.\u2019\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t about hunting. \u2018Killer\u2019 was another name for Zankus.\u00a0</span><span>This wasn\u2019t an ordinary arrow, but one that contained the archer\u2019s will.\u00a0</span><span>It was placed in the arrow.\u00a0</span><span>How far was his limit?\u00a0</span><span>Zankus had endlessly practiced with the bow, to the point where he was able to place \u2018death\u2019 in the arrow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Now he was in the area of \u2018killing\u2019, rather than \u2018hunting.\u2019\u00a0</span><span>Zankus\u2019s arrow aimed at the black shadow again.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus was unable to move properly in the aftermath of \u2018death.\u2019 Zankus was convinced that the enemy would die by this arrow.</span></p><br/><p><span>But at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>A brilliant light erased his arrow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone on the battlefield looked up at the sky as they saw a flash of brilliant light.\u00a0</span><span>It came from an old man with wings of light. The staff in his hand shook.\u00a0</span><span>Then rays of light surrounded the expedition members. Light shone from their weapons and the wounds were restored again.\u00a0</span><span>The heat from deep inside their body erased their fatigue.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>It wasn\u2019t just the expedition members affected, but the other gods fighting the orcs.\u00a0</span><span>The god of hunting, who had been on the verge of dying from Zankus\u2019 arrow, ended up vanishing.\u00a0</span><span>His body recovered and he avoided \u2018Death.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Sasasasak!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Once again, the beam of light flew towards Zankus.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus barely avoided it as he muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is cheating.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t know the identity of the old man in the sky, but it was a different influence from the other gods.\u00a0</span><span>The power of the old man dominated the battlefield. The light kept encouraging the expedition members, interrupting the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus looked around. The situation was starting to tilt. The orcs were dying.\u00a0</span><span>Kumarak, Anya, Wallachwi etc, were also pushed back. The gods gained strength from the light in the sky.\u00a0</span><span>Defeat was obvious.\u00a0</span><span>And defeat meant genocide.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus\u2019 face distorted for a moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then someone spoke.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018......\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus was stunned.\u00a0</span><span>The voice spoke again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018...!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus\u2019 eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus started laughing.\u00a0</span><span>He lifted his bow and loaded an iron arrow on it. Then he pulled back the bowstring and aimed for the sky.\u00a0</span><span>From far away, a beam of light aimed at Zankus\u2019 neck.\u00a0</span><span>It was a stronger power than before.</span></p><br/><p><span>But Zankus didn\u2019t care.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand.</span></p><br/><p><span>The light.\u00a0</span><span>It disappeared before reaching Zankus.\u00a0</span><span>The rays of light from the old man in the sky also flew towards Zankus. However, they disappeared in front of him, as if they had hit a wall.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus didn\u2019t care about all that.\u00a0</span><span>He concentrated all the strength of his body to one point. It was the best \u2018Death\u2019 arrow he could do.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuoooook...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His muscles screamed. The overloaded muscle fibers started to break down one by one.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuaaaaaaah...!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zankus shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span>He squeezed out all the power in his body. It didn\u2019t matter if his muscles were breaking. His arms burned. His bowstring was pulled back to the maximum extent possible.\u00a0</span><span>Just before Zankus and his bow broke...</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus had a feeling that it was time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>When the string was released...\u00a0</span><span>It was like the dew rolling off the leaves.\u00a0</span><span>Like feathers falling from wings or stamens dangling to the ground.\u00a0</span><span>The death arrow was launched towards the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGoooooooooo\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It flew upwards.\u00a0</span><span>The old man tried to stop the arrow but it flew on, ignoring everything.\u00a0</span><span>The arrow.\u00a0</span><span>It passed by the old man.\u00a0</span><span>It rose to the end of the sky.\u00a0</span><span>The target at the end.\u00a0</span><span>The sun that illuminated the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Sun Killer\u2019 Zankus.\u00a0</span><span>His arrow went beyond time and space to penetrate the sun and kill it.\u00a0</span><span>A black stain appeared in the center of the sun.

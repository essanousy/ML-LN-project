Do you have to look at us to find the answer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The elf nodded in agreement, \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen what\u2019s the problem? I feel worried when you look at us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ohh, how frustrating!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Arakunta laughed as he watched both of them.\u00a0</span><span>\"He\u2019s a person with many secrets. Still, he isn\u2019t a bad person so calm down.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded as he chewed on meat.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI understand. By the way....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were eating the venison that Zankus hunted and Tiyo cooked.\u00a0</span><span>Their speed was a little slower after Arakunta and the elf joined, but they were steadily heading towards Orcrox.\u00a0</span><span>They would arrive soon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Setting aside the elf friend for now, what\u2019s that noise?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t it someone passing by </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey seem to be hiding.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus chewed on the venison and said, \u201cSounds like bandits.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were talking about a rustling bush.\u00a0</span><span>While Crockta\u2019s group was eating, the bushes moved and a group of humans approached.\u00a0</span><span>They seemed to be sneaking around, but it was impossible to fool Crockta\u2019s group.\u00a0</span><span>They all knew about the approach of the humans and kept quiet.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cY-You noticed quickly!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But that doesn't change anything, Orcs!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The humans popped out from the bushes, all wearing the same equipment: leather armor, a sword, and a shield.\u00a0</span><span>Their posture was poor, but their willpower was good.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn the name of the gods!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Punish the orcs!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They rushed forward.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s group exchanged glances, as if passing on the burden, before eventually settling on Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta couldn\u2019t hold up against their heavy gazes and stood up with God Slayer in hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnnoying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stepped forward and wielded the sword. The wind blew. The enemies were pushed away by the wind pressure and fell.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hup!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Their momentum was quickly dampened by his overwhelming dance.\u00a0</span><span>They couldn\u2019t come any closer and stared at Crockta. The fallen people raised their bodies. Their weapons trembled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat strength...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They grabbed their necklaces and prayed to their god.\u00a0</span><span>The group wasn\u2019t made up of bandits, but fanatics targeting the orcs. Apart from the expedition, there were also small groups raiding orcs.\u00a0</span><span>However, they found the wrong opponents.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Follow the divine message! For the god of war!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We shall shed blood for the goddess of mercy!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFor the divine message!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They rushed towards Crockta\u2019s group again. However, Crockta broke all their weapons using God Slayer. As soon as the greatsword hit it, the shields flew away from the shock.\u00a0</span><span>They weren\u2019t his opponents.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you still want to continue?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta headed towards the fallen humans. The humans wriggled as the shadow approached.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta smiled and placed his foot on the chest of one person, who let out a moan.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, the gods want to kill us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kuock...that\u2019s right. The goddess of mercy, no one else, said that! How wicked must you be for the goddess of mercy and compassion to want to kill you! For the goddess!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They wielded their weapons again but were forced to drop them due to Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeeeok...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe gods...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shrugged and asked,\u00a0</span><span>\"Have you ever wondered about the gods you are following?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat nonsense is this...?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will let you know. They aren\u2019t perfect. They lie as we do and deceive others for their own benefit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta knew about the divine message.\u00a0</span><span>So he knew that the gods weren\u2019t absolutely omnipotent. The gods believed that Crockta and the orcs were colluding with the grey god.\u00a0</span><span>This was false.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta had met the grey god. But they were closer to enemies than allies.</span></p><br/><p><span>The situation was ridiculous in Crockta\u2019s eyes, so he thought that the people who believed in the divine message were pitiful.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We aren\u2019t conspiring with the grey god.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What nonsense are you saying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe have no intention of causing a war.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Shut up! We will get rid of you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The humans had no intention of listening to Crockta\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span>Was it because Crockta was pointing a sword at them? Or was their beliefs really that high?\u00a0</span><span>Crockta lifted God Slayer to confirm it.\u00a0</span><span>He moved the blade.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cW-Wait a minute...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The greatsword slowly fell down.\u00a0</span><span>The struggling man caught the blade with his hand. He couldn\u2019t wrap his hand around God Slayer\u2019s huge blade.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuooooh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He also couldn\u2019t beat Crockta\u2019s strength.\u00a0</span><span>He closed his eyes as the blade of the sword pointed at his neck.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"W-Wait a minute...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'm going to kill you.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man shouted as it was about to touch him,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cS-Spare me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The blade stopped.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Spare you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cY-Yes. Stop for a second...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Didn\u2019t you say you wanted to kill me and the orcs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI lost. I admit it.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man shouted with closed eyes. Moisture emerged from the tightly closed eyes.\u00a0</span><span>\"I surrender! Spare me!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His hands shook while holding onto the blade and he shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do the rest of you have the same thoughts?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked around at the believers. Their breathing was rough as they watched Crockta and the man.\u00a0</span><span>Then they nodded.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta pulled God Slayer away.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man got up quickly and stood with his party. They all looked at Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta declared,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThrow away your weapons.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They exchanged looks before slowly dropping their weapons. The spears, swords, shields, etc were all dropped.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnd...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta placed God Slayer on his shoulder.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cGet out of here. The scared humans started to run away.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta admired their quick movements before returning to the party. His face was calm because it was a natural victory.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Daring to go against Crockta... humans are so stupid!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Arakunta was delighted after seeing their movements.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta laughed as he sat back down and picked up the venison. It hadn\u2019t cooled down yet.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>At that time, the elf opened his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>\"Why did you just let them go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta chewed on the venison and replied.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They will come back again after running away. They will join the expedition or attack the other orcs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\"I guess so.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then why did you leave them alive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta laughed. He swallowed the venison and said.\u00a0</span><span>\"It is a good day.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you talking about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The sunshine is good and the wind is cool, so I let them go. They are just following the gods\u2019 divine message, and haven\u2019t sinned.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn addition, a warrior doesn\u2019t attack unarmed people!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The lines on the elf\u2019s face thickened further.\u00a0</span><span>\"Are you serious?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m serious.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta got up after the meal.\u00a0</span><span>\"There is one thing I want to say.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What is it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don't know what you are so worried about. Anyway, all of us will die someday. Life is short so we should just focus on the present.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\"You are alive right now.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The elf\u2019s eyes widened at Crockta\u2019s words. At the same time, the wrinkles on his brow disappeared.\u00a0</span><span>His face was like a pure and bright elf youth.\u00a0</span><span>He looked at Crockta quietly before the lines reappeared.\u00a0</span><span>But there was a slight smile on his face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see. Yes, that is your greeting.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s group started moving again. Now Crockta knew the terrain.\u00a0</span><span>Orcrox was around the corner.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Anail\u2019s king of the underworld.\u00a0</span><span>No one could go against him.\u00a0</span><span>It didn\u2019t mean he terrorized the citizens. However, he penetrated into people\u2019s psychology and deliberately seduced them into a contract.\u00a0</span><span>If they cheated and broke the contract, a pain worse than death waited.</span></p><br/><p><span>That was his way.\u00a0</span><span>As such, he also kept his promises.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thompson.\"\u00a0</span><span>Then he slowly called the opponent\u2019s name.\u00a0</span><span>The opponent\u2019s face was distorted with pain.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYour answer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It will just get worse...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anail\u2019s king teased.\u00a0</span><span>A pained moan emerged from Thompson\u2019s mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh..!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man grinned,\u00a0</span><span>\"It would be easier if you listened to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Thompson gritted his teeth and replied,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cDon\u2019t make me...laugh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You don\u2019t seem to know your situation.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>The man\u2019s laughter rang out in the sealed room.\u00a0</span><span>Thompson\u2019s body shook as he closed his eyes. He didn\u2019t expect this man to be like this. He had been silent, only to suddenly push the blade towards Thompson.\u00a0</span><span>Thompson tried to resist as much as possible, but it couldn\u2019t be helped.</span></p><br/><p><span>He visualized many scenes in his head as the man\u2019s hand moved again.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he cried out, \u201cStop.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Now give up.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStop. I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man laughed,\u00a0</span><span>\"People are fun. You know the result yet still want to challenge it. Continue and continue. In the vain belief that one day you will win.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is human weakness. Thompson.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Thompson couldn\u2019t resist anymore and shouted,\u00a0</span><span>\"Ah, don\u2019t imitate that bastard\u2019s tone!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man was surprised at the sudden shout,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cW-Why are you shouting all of a sudden, Brother?\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s it. You cheated! That\u2019s right!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Thompson pointed at the chessboard located between them.\u00a0</span><span>\"You were a novice before the bet, yet your skills suddenly improved? Isn\u2019t this cheating in chess?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oh, I didn\u2019t study. Brother, there is no need to be angry. I don\u2019t study but my mind is good. I got better after a few matches.

Ah, shit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man laughed at Thompson\u2019s voice and said,\u00a0</span><span>\"The game is over. Then, I will enforce the contract...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t follow Derek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What's wrong with that?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man whistled.\u00a0</span><span>\"He has already died.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jeremy grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\"Isn\u2019t that right, Kids?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The big men in black outfits, watching the chess match, bowed their heads and shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right!

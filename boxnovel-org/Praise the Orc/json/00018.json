In the meantime, he kept throwing dirt and rocks back at Grom.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWait there!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin hid behind some thick bushes.\u00a0</span><span>Grom jumped over the bushes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGot you...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As Grom landed on the ground, goblins surrounded him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyahahak! Kyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyah! Kyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins no longer held rocks.\u00a0</span><span>They held things like blunt axes, rusty swords, spears, and other weapons that seemed to have been stolen.</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin who lured Grom into the crowd shot a nasty smile at him and threw a rock again.\u00a0</span><span>Grom was hit in the head and fell over. Detestable. Really detestable. He wanted to rush over and give it a good thrashing, but he was outnumbered. It was a group of goblins with over a dozen people.</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom fell back.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Thud, thud.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Someone touched Grom\u2019s back.\u00a0</span><span>He turned around to see a goblin holding a handaxe. He laughed. His rear was also dominated by goblins.</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom laughed awkwardly, \u201c...Kulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom was now able to laugh like an orc.\u00a0</span><span>However, he looked a bit subservient.</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin raised his axe and started a slicing motion towards Grom\u2019s neck. His head would be cut off now if he didn\u2019t run away. As the goblin smiled mockingly, Grom felt a sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.</span></p><br/><p><span>Something boiled up inside him.\u00a0</span><span>He was angry.\u00a0</span><span>It was really detestable.\u00a0</span><span>Yes, this emotion, it was like when someone told him off for being too loud in an Internet cafe.\u00a0</span><span>It felt like that time, when he hit the reset button and ran away.</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom's axe flashed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeeeeek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblin\u2019s head was split apart.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"These kids\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins were astonished and simultaneously rushed towards Grom.\u00a0</span><span>Grom wielded his axe.\u00a0</span><span>There were goblins everywhere.\u00a0</span><span>He spun the axe around and around in order to survive. The goblins didn\u2019t dare approach the wildly spinning axe and retreated.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was his last hurrah, but it worked!</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom shouted as old memories flashed through his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Whirlwind\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then messages popped up.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Congratulations!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[You struggled to survive and have learned an hidden axe technique!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[You are like a terrible trolley car that spins round and round, destroying everything around you in its wake, no matter what!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[This is an attack that enemies can\u2019t deal with!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[All enemies will be unconditionally killed!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[A terrible massacre, a feast of blood is anticipated!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[The wild attack that will decimate everything!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Oh my god!\u00a0</span><span>Grom\u2019s expression brightened.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was clear.\u00a0</span><span>A hidden piece.\u00a0</span><span>This was a hidden piece of Elder Lord, a hidden skill!</span></p><br/><p><span>[Overwhelming Assault (Common) has been acquired!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom wobbled.</span></p><br/><p><span>The name was cool, but it was just an ordinary Common grade skill.\u00a0</span><span>As soon as he lost balance, the goblins charged towards Grom.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeook!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He rolled and avoided their attacks, but his skull was soon smashed by a goblin\u2019s stone hammer. His head started spinning. He could see goblins raising their weapons out of the corner of his eye.</span></p><br/><p><span>This would be his first death since becoming an orc.\u00a0</span><span>Grom closed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, the earth started to shake.</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins flinched.\u00a0</span><span>A thunderous sound hit their ears.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tarrrrrrrr\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom opened his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>10 orc warriors came rushing like crazy.\u00a0</span><span>Their broad shoulders made it seem like they numbered in the dozens, or in the hundreds. They were like a runaway train as they swept through the goblins. The goblins\u2019 bodies flew through the air.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyaaaaak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyak!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKieeeek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins started screaming and crying.\u00a0</span><span>With one assault, dozens of goblins were torn into rags.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeooook!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom shrieked.</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc warriors didn\u2019t care as Grom fell down.</span></p><br/><p><span>[You are in critical condition!]</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom slumped down.</span></p><br/><p><span>The fight was over in a flash.\u00a0</span><span>The goblins were twitching on the ground. The orc warriors killed those goblins without mercy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cApprentice! Where are you? Are you alive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEuh....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom got up.\u00a0</span><span>The faces of the warriors were visible.\u00a0</span><span>All of them looked fearsome. Their faces and bodies were full of tattoos, and they were covered with blood. \u00a0They had relaxed gestures and an imposing walk!</span></p><br/><p><span>The real warriors recognized by Lenox!\u00a0</span><span>The warriors who found Grom laughed out loud, \u201cKulkulkulkul! You\u2019re alive, Apprentice! Wonderful!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You lured the goblins very well! Great talent!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPushovers who see other pushovers would want to catch them!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The goblins truly have discerning eyes! They judged perfectly! They are perfect at judging pushovers! Kuhahahah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s right.\u00a0</span><span>Grom had been acting as the pushover, or bait, all day.</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins were very wary of orcs, but once they saw Grom, they would provoke him and pull him into a large crowd.\u00a0</span><span>Then the orc warriors would rush in to slaughter the group.</span></p><br/><p><span>As the bait, Grom had suffered and almost died many times. The goblins were too much, and he could barely resist for a minute every time. Then, once Grom was surrounded, the orc warriors would charge in and sweep up the goblins.</span></p><br/><p><span>This had happened several times already. The goblins would wither away due to the orc warriors from Orcrox Fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span>The warriors urged Grom to hurry.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then, I\u2019ll ask you to prepare new goblins again, Apprentice!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Warriors, I think it will be hard now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Goblins are also intelligent monsters! At this point, they might\u2019ve noticed your strategy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Besides, I have grown in the battles. I am different from before, I have become stronger. The goblins won\u2019t be able to easily mess with me. They have eyes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>That\u2019s right.\u00a0</span><span>Grom had fought with the warriors. Although he almost died several times, he was able to accumulate skill proficiency and achievement points.\u00a0</span><span>Furthermore, he had gained the Overwhelming Assault (Common) skill.\u00a0</span><span>The goblins wouldn\u2019t be able to defeat Grom, who was more powerful.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes! That's right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But we don\u2019t know if we don\u2019t try one more time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. However, it is a waste of time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom walked through the forest with the warriors behind him.\u00a0</span><span>He was different from before.\u00a0</span><span>He puffed out his chest and showed the attitude of a warrior. Now, Grom was a warrior who stood among the orcs!\u00a0</span><span>He was still an apprentice, but the goblins couldn\u2019t come near him...</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeek! Keek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A goblin appeared before his thought finished!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeek! Keeek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom felt resigned.\u00a0</span><span>The two goblins circled around Grom. They exchanged glances.\u00a0</span><span>Grom was able to guess their meaning.</span></p><br/><p><span>Pushover!\u00a0</span><span>A pushover!</span></p><br/><p><span>Resignation became anger.\u00a0</span><span>Grom cried out as anger rose in his body. His temper blazed fiercely towards the goblins.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThese guys\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the skill Overwhelming Assault!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKyakak, kyaack?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKek? Keehek?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Why did a pushover suddenly become like this? Let's see? Was it money?</span></p><br/><p><span>The goblins stepped back with surprise.\u00a0</span><span>Dozens of suddenly goblins emerged from the rocks!\u00a0</span><span>But Grom, who had become crazy, charged towards them without stopping his assault.\u00a0</span><span>He was like a runaway train!</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Buuuuuuuuul\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500 taaaaaaaaar\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Then this corner!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>A video is the topic!</span></i><i><span>Video of a video!</span></i><i><span>A distilled version is given!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>It is like red ginseng extract!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Oh, Jaehan-ssi.</span></i><i><span>Don\u2019t you think red ginseng is too much?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Hahaha.</span></i><i><span>I\u2019m sorry.</span></i><i><span>I don\u2019t know because I have been taking red ginseng medicine lately.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Distilled?</span></i><i><span>Ohoho, who told you that it was good for you?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>It is a secret.</span></i><i><span>Ahahahaha. </span></i><span>(TL Note: red ginseng can be taken as an aphrodisiac and used to help with male erectile dysfunction)</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They are playing around.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu shook her head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe atmosphere around the two of them is what wins viewers.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are they going to discuss?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu was at Caf\u00e9 Reason with her friend, Yoon Bora.\u00a0</span><span>They were meeting for a group assignment. But as always, various accidents and illnesses occurred, meaning that only the two of them attended.\u00a0</span><span>The two of them quickly quit the task.</span></p><br/><p><span>They watched as the two hosts of [Elder Road Times], Yoojung and Jaehan, introduced the topic.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>The fourth video is a comedy in Elder Lord and will make your stomach hurt just watching it!</span></i><i><span>It is a behind the scenes video of the militia leader, Kim Dalkwang.</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>-Isn\u2019t another name for Kim Dalkwang \u2018Capitalist Monster\u2019, a monster born from capitalism?</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>-Yes!</span></i><i><span>He boasts exceptional role-playing skills.</span></i><i><span>Of course, he isn\u2019t just funny but also has great abilities.</span></i><i><span>Now, then please watch!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The door of Caf\u00e9 Reason opened.\u00a0</span><span>It was Ian.

She walked in gracefully with expensive clothes that seemed to shine. Her hair was wavy, as if it was copper wire, and each sweep of her head was a seductive gesture that made the people who saw it tremble.</span></p><br/><p><span>Had a real celebrity appeared for a photo shoot?\u00a0</span><span>People who looked like bodyguards waited outside the door.

It was a bright smile, like a flower blooming in the spring.\u00a0</span><span>She walked over and held out a hand to Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s been a while.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I didn't know you would come find me like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I thought I should go see my saviour.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian and Ji Hayeon shook hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Raven, no, is it Jung Ian-ssi?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian smiled a the old name that reminded him of the past.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cJust call me Ian-ssi.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, I will.

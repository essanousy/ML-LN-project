A saint could kill a saint, and a wicked man could kill a wicked man.\u00a0</span><span>He erased all previous doubts.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Something\u2019s wrong.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Peros was a noble who knew Anail\u2019s back alley very well.\u00a0</span><span>His plan to put pressure on Thompson failed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe head of the underworld has changed, and the new leader is Crockta\u2019s friend. Rather, the messenger was beaten to death...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFriend...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Aklan laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt is funny.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cT-That\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thompson said the same thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally? He has really wide feet.

This is a little inconvenient, but having extra help is unnecessary. We have a sufficient number of troops and plenty of funds.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>They had difficulties in some of the major cities, but there were enough volunteers.\u00a0</span><span>The scale of the military expedition was unthinkable, and was perhaps the largest number of people in history gathered under a single flag.\u00a0</span><span>The orcs would be trampled on by this army and forgotten.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe gods are helping us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The gods are still whispering. In the end, we will win.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The expedition didn\u2019t need anything else.\u00a0</span><span>Aklan was convinced.\u00a0</span><span>No matter how strong the orcs were, they wouldn\u2019t be able to resist the wrath of the gods.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Victory is only a matter of time. Please relax your mind.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>An unknown power emerged from Aklan as he said this.\u00a0</span><span>He gripped his fists tightly.\u00a0</span><span>His body shuddered as his whole body filled with an unknown strength.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe war god has spoken.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Peros stepped back, confused by Aklan\u2019s changed appearance.\u00a0</span><span>The smell of fanaticism was coming from Aklan.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator watched Aklan and asked, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am as okay as ever.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You know...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Adandator studied Aklan and sighed.\u00a0</span><span>He could see that Aklan was in an unknown state.\u00a0</span><span>\"Any more divine power will break your body.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The power of a god dwelt in Aklan.\u00a0</span><span>It was an arrangement for the future war.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator didn\u2019t know what the war god was planning, but a tremendous amount of divine power was entering Aklan.</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan smiled and said, \"It's okay. It is different from what you are concerned about. I am more powerful than ever.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Yes. You would know best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator shrugged. In fact, he didn\u2019t care about Aklan\u2019s condition.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe are finally at Orcrox.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. I can see the end.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Aklan smiled.\u00a0</span><span>At last, this expedition was heading towards the climax.\u00a0</span><span>The expedition passed through Quantes and arrived in Anail.\u00a0</span><span>They also didn\u2019t receive hospitality in Anail. The king of the underworld, Jeremy, and Thompson were close to Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Everywhere they went, they saw people who saw Crockta as their savior.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was the one who made the volunteer group, the hero who saved a village, the honorary citizen who exposed the ugly side of the mayor, the warrior who stopped the demon in a city, and the savior of many influential people.</span></p><br/><p><span>But he had brought the wrath of the gods on him.\u00a0</span><span>No matter what Crockta had done, he was defined by the last line.\u00a0</span><span>Anyway, everything was decided by the gods.\u00a0</span><span>Human work was useless against divine matters.</span></p><br/><p><span>The lead riders waved their flags. They reported something to Aklan and Adandator.\u00a0</span><span>Indeed, as they said, something could be seen in the distance.\u00a0</span><span>All the leaders were agitated.\u00a0</span><span>Aklan smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>They were orcs.\u00a0</span><span>They had come out, rather than hiding in Orcrox.</span></p><br/><p><span>A battlefield suitable for the climax.\u00a0</span><span>It was the opening of the great war.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at Yiyu with a mouth full of Burger King\u2019s extra large burger.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why do you look like that?\u201d she asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou\u2019re acting like a beggar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu snorted before eating her hamburger again and drinking some soda with her straw.\u00a0</span><span>Ian picked up some fries and placed them in his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEat slowly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He had accessed Elder Lord for so long that he hadn\u2019t seen her in a while, so they went out together.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You know what? There will be another great war in Elder Lord. Will Oppa be taking part? You have been living in the game lately.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The fight between the expedition and the orcs was a hot topic in reality.\u00a0</span><span>This time, users weren\u2019t involved since it was a dispute between NPCs. Thus, it was difficult to predict who would win.\u00a0</span><span>On the gambling sites, the dividends for who would win were quiet even, while users who wanted to fight were waiting impatiently.</span></p><br/><p><span>As well as the expedition, the orcs of Orcrox were fighting together, causing a lot of confusion.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let's see...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s voice trailed off.\u00a0</span><span>In fact, he couldn\u2019t not go.\u00a0</span><span>He was one of the parties involved in the war, but Ian couldn\u2019t tell her that.\u00a0</span><span>He started stretching inside the fast food restaurant.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t Oppa a ranker now? You aren\u2019t still a beginner, are you? A few of my friends are playing it full-time. Tsk tsk. They don\u2019t study and play games instead.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What have you been doing in the meantime?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu laughed with the straw in her mouth.\u00a0</span><span>\"I will receive a scholarship this semester.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m not expecting anything, so you don\u2019t have to.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cReally.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Just work hard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Wow, you don\u2019t believe your little sister.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt will be bad if you overdo it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The expression of her goal was good, but if she couldn\u2019t keep her word after declaring it so badly, she would be the most embarrassed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm...\"\u00a0</span><span>Ian looked at Yiyu and smiled as he said, \u201cJung Yiyu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCan you do it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Haven\u2019t I always done well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then I'm glad.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian nodded.\u00a0</span><span>As he told Yoo Jaehan, he refrained from playing Elder Lord often and was going to stay away from dangerous events.\u00a0</span><span>But it didn\u2019t help the situation.\u00a0</span><span>His assimilation rate was still at 100%.</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god no longer spoke to him, but her words about dying in Elder Lord were still valid.\u00a0</span><span>He wasn\u2019t a game player anymore. His status window had also disappeared. There was no such thing as skill level or item rating.\u00a0</span><span>The moment he accessed Elder Lord, he became the orc warrior Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then once things finish, I should go...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What? Where? Why?\"\u00a0</span><span>Anxiety filled Yiyu\u2019s eyes. </span></p><br/><p><span>Ian shrugged and replied,\u00a0</span><span>\"I was thinking about going on a trip...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Alone?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will go too!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You will?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian laughed as he saw Yiyu\u2019s excitement.\u00a0</span><span>There was a battle ahead of him.\u00a0</span><span>He couldn\u2019t step back here. Elder Lord might be a game in the past, but he couldn\u2019t escape now that he knew they were alive.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Due to that, all the orcs were being threatened.\u00a0</span><span>He vowed to avoid dangerous situations but he couldn\u2019t do so. The moment he joined Elder Lord, he became Crockta and thought like an orc warrior.\u00a0</span><span>He wanted to consider Yiyu but the moment he became Crockta, living as a warrior became more important than anything else.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I know all about your trip,\u201d Yiyu said. </span></p><br/><p><span>Ian was confused.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You aren\u2019t going on a trip alone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUhh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Aren\u2019t I quick to notice?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian rolled his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cDon\u2019t you have a girlfriend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Eh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oppa finally got a girlfriend and you\u2019re thinking about marriage. So you say that you\u2019re going alone. It is great, so I respect Oppa\u2019s thoughts. Of course, you should introduce me to your girlfriend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is she perhaps younger than me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ll still understand. Don\u2019t worry about me. I originally do well alone. I don\u2019t want you to sacrifice yourself because of me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Right now, I am sacrificing the value of those hamburgers...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Quiet!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Ian smiled as Yiyu pointed her finger at him and placed the last piece of hamburger in her mouth.\u00a0</span><span>\"Anyway, Oppa should do whatever you want. Have I ever been in an accident when Oppa wasn\u2019t with me? No?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>When Ian was a soldier, she had stayed with some relatives. They weren\u2019t relatives with a strong affection for their kin.\u00a0</span><span>Rather, they were more interested in Ian\u2019s money.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t a comfortable place, but Yiyu never complained or caused problems. She behaved too well.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian smiled bitterly.\u00a0</span><span>He knew. Yiyu had endured some difficult times. People would experienced hardships would become tougher. Yiyu was probably stronger than he knew.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'm pretty and have a good head, so I live in a comfortable world. Oppa doesn\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Good head?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oh, my grades are like this because I don\u2019t study! My mind is good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian laughed.\u00a0</span><span>His will had been written since he was a soldier. Between then and now, nothing had changed in the contents of the will.\u00a0</span><span>Furthermore, he could trust his teacher Baek Hanho.\u00a0</span><span>Yiyu hadn\u2019t known it, but Baek Hanho had kept watch to see if her relatives would harass her.\u00a0</span><span>He would protect Yiyu if something happened to Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let\u2019s really go on a trip later. Where do you want to go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The Maldives!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOkay. Let's go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyah, really?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This was the most important thing.\u00a0</span><span>He couldn\u2019t die.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"When have I ever lied?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Indeed. I acknowledge that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian had always survived. This time would be the same as well. He would become Crockta and defend Orcrox.\u00a0</span><span>When Crockta held God Slayer, he was confident that he couldn\u2019t lose to anyone.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u00a0Once this fight ended, he had the feeling that the grey god would appear. Then he would ask her the question he really wanted to ask.</span></p><br/><p><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Hello.</span></i><i><span>Thank you to the viewers who have always loved the Undergames Channel.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Today is the day when the battle between the orcs and the expedition will occur.

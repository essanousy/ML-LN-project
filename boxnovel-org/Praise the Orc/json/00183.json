If Zakiro hadn\u2019t been with them, they would\u2019ve gotten lost several times.\u00a0</span><span>There were obstacles scattered all over the map.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is your cue, Anor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cScary\u2026 I don\u2019t want to look.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are the scariest person here <em>dot!</em> Raise your bones!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUnderstood.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor used his necromancy to defeat the monsters.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the great forest, they fought monsters several times a day. As a result of such hardships, they were able to find a huge wall standing in the lush forest.\u00a0</span><span>It was the black barrier which was the symbol of Geherad.</span></p><br/><p><span>They stood at the entrance.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOrc, dark elf, gnome, and dwarf. How strange.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The guards\u2019 eyes widened at the appearance of such unique group. The guards themselves were a mixture of humans and dwarves.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, so what did you come for?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTo look for a per...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPilgrimage.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro interrupted Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWe came to worship the last fire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh, I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The dwarf guards nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you a blacksmith?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you intend to enter the last forge?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf it is possible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood luck.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He chuckled.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor, who didn\u2019t know what the last fire or last forge was, just stood in the rear.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGood luck. You can enter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The passage was clear.\u00a0</span><span>Just like the walls, Geherad\u2019s buildings were made of black soil. The entire city looked like it was covered in coal.</span></p><br/><p><span>The scale of the city wasn\u2019t that big. After all, it would be difficult to maintain a large city in the great forest. Most of the inhabitants were dwarves and humans, while other species were occasionally seen.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, a large building at the center of the city stood out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is the resting place of the last fire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is the last fire <em>dot?</em>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cComing to Geherad without even knowing...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThe last fire literally means a fire that will remain until the end of the world. What is the longest lasting fire in the world?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe world\u2019s longest lasting fire...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo thought about it. He rolled his eyes as he tried to think of the answer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet's see\u2026\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOver there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro pointed to the sky.\u00a0</span><span>The sun that illuminated the world. Tiyo\u2019s face brightened as he squinted at it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe sun <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Strictly speaking, the sun god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is the first time I\u2019ve heard of the sun god <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe was originally a great god, but now he is said to be in a deep sleep. I don\u2019t know the situation of the gods, but the sun is still burning, so he hasn\u2019t completely disappeared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Geherad\u2019s \u2018last fire\u2019 was a remnant of the sun god, and the large building at the center of Geherad was the temple of the sun.\u00a0</span><span>Originally, the gods revealed their existence by helping out or passing on divine messages. However, the sun god didn\u2019t do that. It was said that the sun god had fallen into a long sleep.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen what is the last forge?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro grinned at Crockta\u2019s question.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is literally the last forge. If the sun is the longest fire in the world, then the last forge is the place that will hold it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere is a forge like that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right. Most people come to Geherad for that purpose. In the place where the last fire is gathered, I want to borrow the best heat to create a masterpiece. It is the holy place of the blacksmiths.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSo, that\u2019s why you tried to come here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s group came to find Tiyo\u2019s father, but Zakiro had such a situation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, I have now arrived. Thank you for helping me get here.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro said goodbye to them.\u00a0</span><span>He only accompanied them here, so it was now time to separate.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded and extended his fist. Zakiro smiled and bumped his fist against Crockta\u2019s. It was the first time he had used an orc gesture, but it didn\u2019t feel bad.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar. I am alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He also said goodbye to Tiyo and Anor.\u00a0</span><span>Then just before he moved away, Zakiro asked Crockta,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWarrior. I heard your name is Crockta?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He had learned this fact while accompanying them here. The name of the orc, who he had thought was just a skilled warrior, was actually Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro confirmed again,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThe \u2018Northern Conqueror,\u2019 Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cCorrect. I am Northern Conqueror Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...That\u2019s right. It was an honor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he turned away.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro headed straight to the temple of the sun god, the place where the last fire was kept. In the black temple, a sharp spire stood out that pointed towards the sun.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNorthern Conqueror Crockta is using my sword...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It wasn\u2019t a bad feeling.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s reputation was great enough that Zakiro had heard it even back when he didn\u2019t leave his clan\u2019s smithy. Crockta wasn\u2019t just strong. He also maintained the faith.\u00a0</span><span>Not only had he performed various activities on the continent, he had also punished the crazy chieftain and blocked the ambition of the empire.</span></p><br/><p><span>Moreover, it had been done with Zakiro\u2019s sword, Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>It felt wonderful.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHowever...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>That wasn\u2019t the only reason why Crockta\u2019s name was engraved in his mind.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta would be in crisis in the near future.\u00a0</span><span>They were enemies who couldn\u2019t be compared to the opponents Crockta had faced previously.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe fickle gods...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Despite all the work Crockta had done, the gods had sent a divine message pointing to Crockta\u2019s death. It said to destroy Crockta and his orc kin.\u00a0</span><span>The dwarves in Zakiro\u2019s hometown hurried.\u00a0</span><span>It was a divine message which involved the fate of the entire continent.</span></p><br/><p><span>As long as the gods targeted Crockta, a harsh future would follow.\u00a0</span><span>To overcome such hardships, the sword \u2018Ogre Slayer\u2019 wasn\u2019t appropriate.\u00a0</span><span>The ending was obvious.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro worried about it for a moment before shrugging it off.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a blacksmith, and his mission was to create a weapon. Zakiro was merely a craftsman aiming to complete the best work.\u00a0</span><span>It was none of his business, even if the warrior who held his sword would eventually die because of the gods.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro stood in front of the temple and blocked everything out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet\u2019s see it once, the last fire.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The only thing important to him now was the \u2018last forge.\u2019</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>After separating from Zakiro, Crockta\u2019s party explored the city for traces of Hedor.\u00a0</span><span>They asked if anyone knew a gnome called Hedor, but there were no answers. Some people remembered small gnomes but didn\u2019t know much about them.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the end, the sun set.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s it for today.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta stated. He was hungry and tired.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe should go to the temple of the sun god as our final destination today. There might be a clue there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI think so as well <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOkay. Let\u2019s go quickly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They headed to the black building at the center of Geherad.\u00a0</span><span>As Zakiro said, all visitors to Geherad were aiming for the temple of the sun god and the last fire. Therefore, it was like a bustling tourist destination.\u00a0</span><span>Hot air blew out as they entered.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHeat <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhh, I guess it is the temple of the sun god...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you okay <em>dot</em>? Isn\u2019t a necromancer weak to light? The sun isn\u2019t hurting you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The temple contained a place for worship, and at the center, there was an altar which looked like a huge furnace. The heat was flowing from there.\u00a0</span><span>Worshippers bowed their heads towards it and prayed.\u00a0</span><span>There were various species present.\u00a0</span><span>There were warriors like Crockta, magicians, and ordinary people who didn\u2019t know how to fight.\u00a0</span><span>They all prayed to the \u2018last fire\u2019 in the altar at the center of the temple.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIsn\u2019t it wonderful?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A voice rang out.\u00a0</span><span>A dwarf in white clothing was standing beside them. He smiled gently and said,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe sun god has been gone for a long time. He can only be found in the history books. The \u2018last fire\u2019 is the only thing left from him. But people still haven\u2019t forgotten the sun god, so they come here and pray. Why?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a priest here.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta replied,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWell\u2026 is it because of the last forge?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour answer isn\u2019t wrong. But my own answer...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The priest pointed to the ceiling of the temple.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is the sun god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe sun is the highest existence that cares for all things. Without the sun\u2019s light and heat, this world wouldn\u2019t last more than a day. It creates the seasons, helps buds grow and shines light so we can see the world. Thanks to that, the sun\u2019s grace isn\u2019t forgotten.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a plausible answer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIsn\u2019t the fact that we live on this earth the gift of the sun god? People feel this instinctively.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt makes a lot of sense that there is a reason.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta had modern knowledge, so he nodded in acknowledgment. The presence of the sun was the most basic premise for life.</span></p><br/><p><span>After that, the priest gave further explanations.</span></p><br/><p><span>Inside the altar was a piece of the sun god, and it contained a powerful heat that could melt anything. The last forge, which was beyond the worship room, used this heat in its furnace. The forge could only be used by selected craftsmen, and this was determined by the piece of the sun god in the altar.</span></p><br/><p><span>After his explanation, Crockta opened his mouth,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI appreciate the valuable teachings.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is nothing. It is my job.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere is one thing I would like to ask. Have you ever met a gnome traveler called Hedor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHedor\u2026 I\u2019m not sure of the name, but there was a strange gnome. I don\u2019t know if he is Hedor or not.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe looks like this friend.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta gestured to Tiyo. The priest raised his eyebrows as he saw Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh\u2026 It seems like he is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat did that man come for?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe kept asking me about the sun god. He was interested in the ancient myths. I recall that he asked about why the sun god disappeared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They shared some more stories about the gnome called Hedor.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo\u2019s father had come here to look through the records earnestly.\u00a0</span><span>As they talked, it was soon time to close the temple.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf you come back tomorrow, I will give you more information. There might be some records in the journal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is nothing. I am grateful that you came here without forgetting the sun god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They exited the temple.\u00a0</span><span>It was a clear night.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta suddenly looked up at the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span>The sun god...</span></p><br/><p><span>Did he look different from the many different suns glowing in the sky? Crockta had heard that there were more galaxies in the universe than the grains of sand on Earth. If so, who created that infinite possibility?</span></p><br/><p><span>Perhaps one of those distant stars was the Earth he lived on.\u00a0</span><span>Then at that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span>His vision suddenly dimmed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the same feeling he\u2019d had when the Gray God\u2019s Eyes were used. The fated deaths in the world entered his vision.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Numerous white stars were scattered in the black night sky.\u00a0</span><span>The white stars dimmed and became part of the black curtain.\u00a0</span><span>Only the darkness of the night sky remained. This was a black world where all the stars had died.</span></p><br/><p><span>The end of the stars.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t want to see such a sight. Crockta shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he turned off the Gray God\u2019s Eyes. It wasn\u2019t well-controlled, but if he focused his mind, he could gradually escape that feeling. Soon enough, he was able to leave the power of the Gray God's Eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta sighed.\u00a0</span><span>Was he tired, or was the silent gray god doing something again?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta. Look over here <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo said. Crockta rubbed his eyes and raised his head.\u00a0</span><span>Then his body immediately tensed.\u00a0</span><span>There was a group of people holding weapons. All of them had hidden their identities behind hoods.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man at the forefront declared,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThe gods have ordered your death. I will punish you according to the divine message. Don\u2019t blame me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The influence of the divine message began to take effect.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

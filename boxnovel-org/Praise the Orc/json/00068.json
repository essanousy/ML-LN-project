Crockta and Tiyo helped harvest the Manticore\u2019s body parts before the man, whose name was unknown, started to turn around.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo stared blankly at his back.\u00a0</span><span>The man stopped moving.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Come along.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He started moving again.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Tiyo exchanged glances before following.\u00a0</span><span>The man spoke in a tone that seemed to be mocking them, \"The Manticore is dead, but others will come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo grumbled, \"Then why did you help us instead of leaving us to die?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI didn\u2019t want to.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man glanced at Tiyo with emotionless eyes. The cool gaze caused Tiyo to flinch.\u00a0</span><span>\"But Skolla was whining.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSkolla? Who is that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn't answer.</span></p><br/><p><span>They headed to the hunter\u2019s home.</span></p><br/><p><span>The landscape when they were returning was different, and even the distance seemed to have increased. They hadn\u2019t walked that long but now it was taking a long time to get back. The direction had also changed. The compass was still pointing in one direction.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I think the forest has changed...\u201d Crockta muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man laughed, \"This is the Forest of Creatures.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is the forest constantly changing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou didn\u2019t know? You really entered without thinking.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man adjusted the sack he was carrying. The blood of the Manticore dripped out of the bag.\u00a0</span><span>\"Why are idiots who don\u2019t know such things going to the north?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI want to find my father </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>,\u201d Tiyo replied first.\u00a0</span><span>\"Do you know the adventurer Anato? My father was a great adventurer who went to the north </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man laughed at Tiyo, \"No. I\u2019ve never see a person go to the north.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm, I guess you arrived late and didn\u2019t see him! Since when have you been here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man replied in a natural tone, \"For 50 years.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>The man looked like a normal middle-aged man. If he had been here for 50 years, how old was he now?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I came here when I was 40 years old.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen you are now...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo didn\u2019t say anything else. That was already the end of the human lifespan.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you perhaps a mixed race?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA human.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was impossible for a 90-year-old human to be so healthy.\u00a0</span><span>The man added, \"I am from the Shakan Clan.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Shakan...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Now Tiyo nodded. Crockta didn\u2019t understand so he looked at Tiyo, who explained, \"The Shakan is an old hunter clan. I heard that they had died out.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do they live that long?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know. Not much is known...maybe he is lying but...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo lowered his voice, \"The Shakan are those who never forget a grudge </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The hunter clan Shakan, those who never forgot a grudge. After hearing Tiyo\u2019s explanation, the man\u2019s back looked bleak.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But he said 50 years, so he must\u2019ve seen my father. That must be a lie </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Maybe they just didn\u2019t meet each other.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStill...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo stared at the man\u2019s back with suspicious eyes.\u00a0</span><span>This time, Crockta was the one to ask a question to the man, \"Do you know about the Temple of the Fallen God in the north?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man shook his head as he looked ahead. </span><span>The silence continued. </span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta spoke again, \"Let me know your name.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man paused for a while before replying.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI am called Shakan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour name.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Shakan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man was from the Shakan Clan, and his name was also Shakan.\u00a0</span><span>There seemed to be a story behind it.</span></p><br/><p><span>They quietly followed Shakan.</span></p><br/><p><span>They reached Shakan\u2019s home within a short time. The moat and thorny fence were wrapped around it. They passed through the shallow part of the moat and through the small hole in the fence, just like when they followed the cow.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta realized that the fortress had no entrance and this was the only doorway.\u00a0</span><span>An artifact hid the presence of this place. The moat and the fence were both strong. Even so, the entrance was concealed to minimize risk.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a thorough hunter.</span></p><br/><p><span>The cows gave a long cry as they returned, \u201cMoooooo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Shakan laughed out loud.\u00a0</span><span>It was a clear laugh that was unimaginable for the man who acted coldly towards Crockta and Tiyo. Shakan approached a cow and hugged it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, I brought them, Skolla, so don\u2019t complain anymore. Yes, yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was like he was having a conversation with a cow.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Tiyo tilted their heads.</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan turned towards them. His hard face had relaxed. His eyes curved as he gave a gentle smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy first son, Skolla.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He stroked the cow\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis one is Penando, and the other one is Achilles.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He pointed to the cows one by one.\u00a0</span><span>\"They are Shakan like me who will become great hunters. Say hello.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo bowed at the innocent expression on his face.\u00a0</span><span>They couldn\u2019t tell if he was joking or if he just had affection for the cows. Shakan quickly fed the cows again. The cows waved their tails.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is the Shakan law to take care of guests,\u201d Shakan said with a mock-stern tone.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...What is this Crockta?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo poked Crockta\u2019s side. Crockta didn\u2019t know either.\u00a0</span>He stepped forward and said, \u201cThat cow called Skolla is smart.\u201d</p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Shakan looked up from where he was patting Skolla.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEven knowing the paths in the forest...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The cow?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That cow. You called it Skolla.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan stared blankly at Crockta and then looked at Skolla again.\u00a0</span><span>He blinked and alternated looking between Crockta and the cow.\u00a0</span><span>He gazed straight at Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh...yes, cow...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then his expression changed.\u00a0</span><span>The traces of the man singing to the cow couldn\u2019t be seen anymore as it returned to the same cold expression from when he first met Crockta and Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. Cow. A cow. Is this cow smart?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is strange. A cow is just a cow. I just raise them for the milk.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta got goose bumps at the sudden change in attitude.\u00a0</span><span>It was a hard conversation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou introduced it as your son.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>But Shakan was still confused.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"My sons are all dead.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You said Skolla...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He blinked in confusion. Crockta spoke again.\u00a0</span><span>\"You said that the cows were called Skolla, Penando, and Achilles.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMe?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The man was confused. What was with this expression? Then he shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>\u201c...I just named the cows after my dead sons. There is no meaning. The dead are dead.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he entered the log cabin.\u00a0</span><span>The cow called Skolla let out a long cry, \u201cMoooooo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta felt a chill.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man had spent 50 years in this place. He lived alone in the Forest of Creatures where no one came. It was natural to turn strange after enduring such lonely and dangerous times.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta...\u201d Tiyo called his name from behind.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIs it okay to stay here...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo seemed reluctant after seeing Shakan\u2019s behavior. Crockta placed a hand on Tiyo\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t think he is a bad person so let\u2019s hear more about the forest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo entered the house after Shakan.</span></p><br/><p><span>As soon as they entered, the skull of a creature could be seen.\u00a0</span><span>A giant head. It was like a human but the skull was much bigger, the mouth protruded and the teeth were as sharp as saw blades.\u00a0</span><span>An ogre\u2019s skull.\u00a0</span><span>But there were two of them. The two skulls were placed side by side like they were linked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTwin head ogre...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It wasn\u2019t just that. All types of skulls were displayed, testifying to Shakan\u2019s past. In addition to skulls, things such as hands, teeth and shin bones acted as his hunting record.\u00a0</span><span>It seemed like a bones museum. He hunted all these things alone in the Forest of Creatures.\u00a0</span><span>Hunting tools were hung in a corner. He had everything from a long bow, knives, axes and anything else that a hunter would need.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is stew made with vegetables and eggs okay?\u201d Shakan\u2019s voice was heard from behind.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thank you.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Just wait.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The smell of food filled the room. Crockta and Tiyo entered the kitchen. Steam was coming up from the pot that Shakan was boiling. Crockta and Tiyo sat down at the table.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCan I do anything to help...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a cold reply. \u00a0</span><span>Tiyo pouted.</span></p><br/><p><span>Within a short time, the hearty stew was finished. Shakan scooped plenty of stew into the bowl. Shakan\u2019s face seemed softer in the warm light of the house.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why were you going to the north again?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He asked as he passed by. Tiyo replied.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI want to find my father</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>. Crockta is searching for the Temple of the Fallen God </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. And also...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo drank the stew and continued, \"Of course, it is also to go on an adventure. I want to see new places </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAdventure...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan looked down at his fingers.\u00a0</span><span>\"Are you curious about new places?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOf course </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>. I can see the way that civilizations have evolved </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! Challenge and response!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Challenge...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\"My sons also did that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo became quiet as the word \u2018sons\u2019 came out again.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan got up and brought out warm milk.\u00a0</span><span>\"My sons would\u2019ve become great Shakan hunters. The Shakan are the best hunters.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan took a posture like he was pulling a bowstring.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hunters must be cautious, bold and patient. My first son, Skolla hid in the mud for over a month to catch drakes. In the end, he shot an arrow into its mouth. Isn\u2019t that great patience? It was the first time in Shakan history that someone caught a drake. Huhuhuhu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo\u2019s spoons slowed down.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We are the last Shakan, but I believed that my sons would spread the name of Shakan again.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe last Shakan...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThey all died. Now those who remember the Shakan have disappeared, and Shakan has become an old name. So my first son Skolla planned something huge for the resurrection of Shakan. He planned to open up the north to let the entire continent know the name of Shakan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat do you mean by opening the north?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe said he would get rid of the Forest of Creatures with his own hands!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo\u2019s eyes shone.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"So he left for the Forest of Creatures. So, the source of the Forest of Creatures...that...what happened...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Shakan scratched his head. \u00a0His face became confused.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cAhh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He grabbed his head.\u00a0</span><span>\"What is today? Wait...my head hurts. Wait a bit...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He left the room.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo ate the vegetable stew in a heavy silence.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Father, I will open the north!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>You can\u2019t. It is too dangerous.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018I can do it. We are Shakan.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The Shakan are hunters, not heroes. That thing is too scary.</span></p><br/><p><span>'The founder of the Shakan hunted a dragon and took its heart to open the Shakan bloodline. I\u2019m not scared at all. We were born with dragon\u2019s blood.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>You are obviously an exceptional hunter. Maybe even better than me. But Son...</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018I can do it. It is a mission for the last Shakan.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan chewed on the meat. His teeth grabbed onto hard muscles. He endured it. His esophagus shook as the blood rushed down his throat. He opened his eyes. Vivid memories appeared everywhere around him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Father. A Shakan never forgets his enemies.'</span></p><br/><p><span>You can\u2019t. It is too dangerous.</span></p><br/><p><span>'This is my brother\u2019s will.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>It isn\u2019t something you can hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span>'There is nothing that the Shakan can\u2019t hunt. And we are Shakan.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>My words...</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018A Shakan can\u2019t let their enemies live!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Reality and memories mixed together, causing his head to become heavy. The past memories weighed down on his shoulders. His breathing was painful but he endured it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is that season again...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He chewed on the last piece of meat.\u00a0</span><span>His spirit cleared.\u00a0</span><span>The iron taste of blood reminded him of arrowheads and blades. His body was tense and his muscles swelled.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was the last chance.\u00a0</span><span>Maybe these visitors were the last blessing given to him.</span></p><br/><p><span>His end wouldn\u2019t be lonely. His sons. And...</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018I can\u2019t live any longer.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>His wife.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan returned. He looked cold like when they first saw him. This wasn\u2019t the man excited when talking about his sons.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was something around his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Your mouth...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan wiped at his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>It looked like a bloodstain to Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan looked at both Crockta and Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>\"Do you really want to go to the north?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo replied at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Despite the dangers?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded. They had been prepared for danger the moment they started.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen I will let you know. There is only one way to go to the north.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Shakan sat down. His face became solemn.

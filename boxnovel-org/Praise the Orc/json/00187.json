The terrified blacksmiths also left the forge.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the same for the priest and Crockta\u2019s group in the archives. They rushed outside as the temple became hotter.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What is this...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh my god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe sun god!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCome this way!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Those who evacuated to the outskirts stared at the temple with devastation.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta gazed at the temple.\u00a0</span><span>It seemed like the entire building was on fire.\u00a0</span><span>Nevertheless, the temple itself didn\u2019t combust. The whole temple felt like a melting fire pit but nothing was destroyed. Even the flags flying from the temple maintained their intact appearance.\u00a0</span><span>It maintained its intact appearance despite being surrounded by a red flame.</span></p><br/><p><span>The priest muttered,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThe sun will burn his enemy and wrap itself around his children. To those who don\u2019t believe in him, he is the plague of hell.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>People looked at him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is the power of the sun god. His flame is said to burn the enemies, while not harming those who weren\u2019t enemies.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is the sun god waking up? This is obviously his power.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Perhaps finally...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The huge temple was burning while maintaining its appearance.\u00a0</span><span>It was an unbelievable sight that couldn\u2019t be understood unless the power of a god were involved.\u00a0</span><span>People started to talk about the resurrection of the sun god.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then someone said,\u00a0</span><span>\"No, that isn't the case.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Rastad?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Rastad.\u00a0</span><span>There was an unknown expression on his face. It was both jubilant and bittersweet.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat isn\u2019t the resurrection of the sun god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is the last forge.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Everyone staring blankly at him.\u00a0</span><span>Only the priest nodded like he understood,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI understand. It is the last forge.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What do you mean?\" Wasn\u2019t the last forge the place where we were?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>One blacksmith asked Rastad.\u00a0</span><span>Rastad shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is just a room next to the worship room. The true last forge is somewhere else, and it isn\u2019t a place we can use whenever we want. It is a legendary forge that appears when the last fire burns.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Now there was a clear smile on his face.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThere are three conditions necessary to truly use the last forge. It will appear when the world needs the last forge, when a worthy craftsman puts the iron into the furnace and... </span></p><br/><p><span>He looked at Crockta, who flinched.\u00a0</span><span>Rastad smiled so widely that his canine teeth were revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhen a warrior who deserves a weapon made in the last forge is met. The last forge will only appear then.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Rastad finished speaking and fell silent.\u00a0</span><span>It was a sight that he might never see again in his life.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment.\u00a0</span><span>It started to rain.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Chiiiik!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Steam appeared as the fire around the temple and the rain met. The entire temple was covered in steam, making it not visible anymore.\u00a0</span><span>Consecutive scenes that were hard to believe appeared.\u00a0</span><span>Then they heard the sound of iron being hit.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The sound became bigger.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>There was the blazing temple, pouring rain and hammering sound that rang out all over Geherad.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>After the divine message was received, public opinion wandered for a while but it gradually moved towards a conclusion.\u00a0</span><span>All temples followed the will of their gods and designated Crockta as an enemy to be destroyed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I never thought the day would come when all gods would whisper the same words.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>A man wearing steel armor said.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Duke Christian of the empire looked at him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is a chance I never thought would come in my life. I am going.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man standing in front of him was one of Christian\u2019s subordinates.\u00a0</span><span>He was an important talent, a person that Christian didn\u2019t spare any support for and was placed right below him. The strongest magician Mogsulin was one of his representatives.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the same for the man in front of him, a paladin chosen by the god of war. Using the god of war\u2019s blessing, Aklan wiped out all enemies in front of him.\u00a0</span><span>He welcomed this divine message more than anyone else. He wanted to get rid of Crockta and the orcs as soon as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span>His determined eyes proved this.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHrmm, I see.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Christian thought about it.</span></p><br/><p><span>The deeply religious elves and dwarves were already preparing to march.\u00a0</span><span>It was a divine message so volunteer troops gathered together. Those who knew how to fight, the soldiers and those who wanted to win gathered together.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t just due to the divine message but also the ambition to distinguish themselves in a great cause. Those who wanted to know themselves and acquire honor lined up.\u00a0</span><span>The goal was Orcrox in the land of the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man standing here, Aklan, was a person filled with both honor and faith in his god.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If that is your will, I can\u2019t stop you.\u201d Duke Christian replied.\u00a0</span><span>He spoke negatively to the emperor about this fight, but he also thought it was important.\u00a0</span><span>However, he didn\u2019t want to follow the trend. He was the person throwing the fire, not the one who caught on fire.</span></p><br/><p><span>And Aklan was the best person to set fire to.\u00a0</span><span>He believed in the god of war. That was the reason for Aklan\u2019s existence.\u00a0</span><span>This fanaticism would spread to people like a disease.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAdandator wants to accompany me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAdandator?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator had been injured in the battle against Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Was it due to vengeance? Or maybe Aklan\u2019s madness had moved him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOkay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It didn\u2019t matter. Adandator was a person close to the emperor. He didn\u2019t have a large relationship with Christian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Please understand, I can\u2019t send the regular armies and knights. It is because it is the emperor, not the gods, that is at the top of the empire.\u201d Christian explained.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I know.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t recruit volunteers. Gather people from the temple of the war god. Try whatever you can. I will speak to the emperor. If the soldiers want to go, they will be able to.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Aklan bowed deeply.\u00a0</span><span>\"I will return to pay back all your grace.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t worry about that. Bring back victory. That is enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen please go.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Aklan rose, bowed once more to Christian and turned around.</span></p><br/><p><span>Christian watched him leave and thought.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>'Please spread this war so that everyone will become wounded, and there is no clear winner.'</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe orcs will truly cease to exist. Then the balance of the continent will fall.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Create a shocking and exciting upheaval.</span></p><br/><p><span>Christian smiled.\u00a0</span><span>\"What do you think?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Then a man standing next to Duke Christian revealed himself. The robed man was the great magician, Mogsulin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe orcs will disappear from the continent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Aren\u2019t there monsters among the orcs?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They are monsters, but their opponents are gods. All the gods are hostile to the orcs. Who can survive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It can\u2019t be helped, even if the fallen god is behind them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>According to Mogsulin, the power of the fallen god was felt strongly from Crockta when he fought the empire, making the gods take this action.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m glad you are here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Mogsulin had touched the Pinnacle and was linked to the gods. He overheard the stories of the gods and told Christian.\u00a0</span><span>Without Mogsulin, he wouldn\u2019t have known all of this.\u00a0</span><span>Mogsulin smiled and bowed at Christian\u2019s praise.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut what will happen if that Crockta wins? He has succeeded in doing things that seem impossible. He is an orc but I admire him. No matter how great the gods are, I can\u2019t help feeling uneasy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This time, even he\u2019s unable to do anything. He might be the best fighter who defeated Adandator, but the gods aren\u2019t existences that can be killed with swords.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Those who can\u2019t be killed by swords...how reliable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Christian laughed.\u00a0</span><span>People all over the continent were following the divine message.\u00a0</span><span>This was a great opportunity for those like Christian.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The rain didn\u2019t stop falling in Geherad.\u00a0</span><span>Nevertheless, the flames around the temple didn\u2019t go out. People tried to approach the temple but couldn\u2019t enter due to the heat. An extraordinary event was going on.</span></p><br/><p><span>In addition, the banging sound continued to ring through Geherad.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\"Zakiro, is he alive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe can still hear the sound...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHas he eaten <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat a great guy, <em>dot</em>. If I was him, I would die from hunger. Ohh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>According to the priest and Rastad, Zakiro was currently making a weapon with the last fire. A type of divine power had descended.\u00a0</span><span>However, Crockta, Tiyo, and Anor focused on eating as the crazy blacksmith hammered on the iron.</span></p><br/><p><span>The interior was very hot so Zakiro might already be burned.\u00a0</span><span>Fortunately, the knocking sound continued but it was unknown if he was perfectly safe. This was a problem that continued all day.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBy the way, my father said he was going north <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said the priest as he drank his beer.</span></p><br/><p><span>Due to the burning temple, the priest lost his home and stayed with Crockta\u2019s group at the inn for a while.\u00a0</span><span>There was no rule against priests drinking alcohol. The excited priest drank the beer. He maintained good manners but he was still a dwarf.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI remember him saying it in passing. He is seeking a person who knows the myths in the north.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy dad really is a wanderer <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They pursued him from the north to the south, then the west and now they were heading north again.\u00a0</span><span>It was traveling all around the continent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut this time, the north...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo looked at Crockta and asked, \"Won\u2019t the land of the orcs appear <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed,\u201d Crockta nodded in agreement.\u00a0</span><span>If they headed north from Geherad, Orcrox and Basque Village would appear.\u00a0</span><span>Their destination was there, as if someone was intentionally leading them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt has been a really long time since I\u2019ve returned home.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The place where everything began, Orcrox.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was filled with a burning desire to go back there.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"By the way, when will Zakiro finish the sword? I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMe too <em>dot</em>. Crockta is great, isn\u2019t this like a divine sword?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you think it might be a legendary sword?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They looked at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>All of this was happening due to Crockta\u2019s Ogre Slayer. What type of weapon would be created?\u00a0</span><span>Crockta scratched his head and said, \"Uhh...well...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He wasn\u2019t sure.\u00a0</span><span>He expected a great weapon, but it became somewhat burdensome due to the burning temple, steam and knocking sound.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, a dwarf sitting in the next chair asked, \"Hey, can you hear that sound anymore?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The sound of iron being hammered had stopped.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was quiet.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone got up in excitement.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPerhaps!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let\u2019s go <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The group left the inn.\u00a0</span><span>It was still raining.\u00a0</span><span>In the rain, the temple lost the fire and steam, gradually returning to its original appearance. The flames around the temple that surprised Geherad faded.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s group ran towards the temple. As they approached, they saw a man appear at the door of the temple.\u00a0</span><span>It was Zakiro. His body was covered in soot but his eyes were shining. He found Crockta and started to walk over, his steps filled with exhaustion.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was holding a greatsword in his hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta approached and faced him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Good work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro stopped, looked up at Crockta, and laughed.\u00a0</span><span>Words weren\u2019t necessary.\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro, a blacksmith of the Golden Anvil Clan, a genius who received the title of \u2018Slayer Maker\u2019 at a young age.\u00a0</span><span>He handed over the weapon that he poured everything into.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta realized it the moment he received the new sword.\u00a0</span><span>This wasn\u2019t a normal greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>He knew it.\u00a0</span><span>It was more than a weapon.\u00a0</span><span>The standards that he knew about swords were all broken, and he felt like he could cause a miracle just holding this sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>The perfect gift for a warrior.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta wielded it before looking at Zakiro with a shiver.\u00a0</span><span>How should he show his appreciation to the blacksmith who created this?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cZakiro...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta opened his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>His mouth opened and closed.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was speechless as he suppressed his emotions.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGeez, something like this...\u201d</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

Was it because he didn\u2019t know the meaning of regular? Or was it because it was a negotiation psychology? Or maybe the person looked like someone who couldn\u2019t say \u2018no?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta felt like that at this moment.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Love Mode is currently locked. Do you want to activate Love Mode?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Was this question even necessary?\u00a0</span><span>Wasn\u2019t it the same as asking, \u2018Are you human?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>What a frustrating question!\u00a0</span><span>Crockta answered decisively.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Eileen headed to Quantes Academy.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a huge facility located in the center of Quantes and was the home of magical engineering research. All different types of works were being developed here. The Asura Thousand Wave Artillery, the core of the Quantes garrison, was created here.</span></p><br/><p><span>The first person they visited was a creature specialist.\u00a0</span><span>Due to Quantes being right next to the north, the gnomes often encountered many creatures, which was why creature research was actively carried out in Quantes.</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnome creatures specialist fixed his glasses and asked, \"You\u2019re going to the north?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I want to visit the Temple of the Fallen God.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe Fallen God, hrmm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Doctor Gnome swept back the white hair on his head.\u00a0</span><span>His body was small, but the wrinkles around his eyes made him seem like a twilight gnome that had lived for a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe Fallen God... It has been a long time since I\u2019ve heard that name.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you know it?\" Crockta asked. </span></p><br/><p><span>The Temple of the Fallen God was known to a certain extent, but no one was able to correctly answer what it was.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don't know exactly what it is, I\u2019ve only heard the name.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The Doctor Gnome buried himself deeply in his chair.\u00a0</span><span>\"Please sit down. My neck will hurt from just looking up at you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This was the laboratory of Doctor Gnome, a creatures specialist. Crockta and Eileen sat down on the chairs in front of Doctor Gnome\u2019s desk.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"For the Fallen God, the theological professors would know better than me, so you should ask them instead. I just know creatures.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. What type of species live in the north?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Doctor Gnome laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\"Orcs like you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOrcs live beyond the forest that separates the north and the rest of the continent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The reason why the northern territory was an object of fear was due to the Forest of Creatures. Few people survived when they entered the forest, but not much was known beyond that fact.\u00a0</span><span>It was the first time he had heard that orcs lived beyond the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Orcs and dark elves. There are also many species that don\u2019t exist on the continent.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But right now, you should be more worried about what is in the forest than what is beyond it. That forest... Ogres are considered just ordinary monsters in there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Doctor Gnome opened a thick book on his desk.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"In particular, it has become strange recently. It is unprecedented for them to charge at Quantes like they have been these days... Those guys are too violent. Thus, it is far more dangerous right now. This is a book that I wrote, so look at the chapter on the north.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta took the book. The table of contents allowed him to roughly learn about the north.\u00a0</span><span>Ogres, trolls, wyverns, great worms, hydras, undead and other evil beings were listed in the index.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta frowned. It was too diverse.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat is a lot. Umm...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta handed the book back, but the doctor refused.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t need it right now, so you can take it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is a reward for protecting Quantes, Ogre Slayer Crockta.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Doctor Gnome laughed. The news that Crockta had repelled the ogres with the gnome garrison had already spread.\u00a0</span><span>\"Captain Tiyo told me. A great orc warrior.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is undeserved praise.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Once upon a time, orcs and gnomes had a good relationship. The big and strong orc, and the small, but clever, gnomes. They helped each other, but that changed over time. That\u2019s why this is good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Doctor Gnome smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Be careful when you venture into the north, as the creatures there are strong. I hope that you arrive safely at the Temple of the Fallen God, and that you find what you wish. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking for there.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you want to know about the Fallen God, then please visit this gnome.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Doctor Gnome wrote something with a feather pen and handed the paper to Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>It contained the name of a theology professor, Doctor Eyona. On it was her address and a simple signature from Doctor Gnome.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"She is enjoying a sabbatical right now, so please visit her. If you say that I sent you, she will be quite happy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta asked Doctor Gnome a few more questions about the north. The most striking story that he heard in return was about the origin of the forest. According to legend, it was originally an ordinary forest; however, an evil spirit died there, causing the evil aura to gradually grow bigger until the forest separated the north from the rest of the continent.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded his head.\u00a0</span><span>\"Thank you for the help.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'm really honored to have helped a famous warrior.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shook hands with Doctor Gnome. Eileen smiled as she watched them.\u00a0</span><span>It was around lunchtime when they left Doctor Gnome\u2019s laboratory. \u00a0</span><span>Eileen asked, \"Crockta, do you want to go see the Demon\u2019s Mouth that I told you about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCan I see it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\"A friend of mine works there, so he can give us a tour. How about it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOkay. I\u2019m also curious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This might be the last chance. I don\u2019t know when it will be permanently sealed.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnomes who gave up on a topic of research would permanently seal it.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Eileen walked away from the laboratory.\u00a0</span><span>The gnomes at the academy were surprised to pass by the unusual combination of an orc and elf.\u00a0</span><span>In some cases, the gnomes would gossip about Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That orc, is he Crockta?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is a big sword. I heard that he suddenly came and slaughtered the ogres with the guards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He looks different from what I expected.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is that his girlfriend?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe best warrior has an elf girlfriend.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The appearance of the orc warrior Crockta and the beautiful elf Eileen stood out among the small gnomes.\u00a0</span><span>They received a lot of attention as they headed to a special facility on the campus of the Quantes Academy.</span></p><br/><p><span>There were guards present at the entrance of the special facility in order to control access.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStop! Stop!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Reveal your identities!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The soldiers restrained them before Eileen took out a pass.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am Eileen from Ariel Academy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, a researcher dispatched to this city. Then, the orc next to you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy guest. I will take responsibility for him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. Pass!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Quantes garrison soldiers were there to defend against theft. They opened the way.\u00a0</span><span>A gnome greeted them as they entered the special institute.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhh! Eileen! You came!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Deco!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a male gnome. His eyes widened as he discovered Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cExcuse me, that orc...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am giving him a tour. I will be thankful for any minute you can spare.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta extended his hand.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI am alive. I am called Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, hello. I am Deco.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Deco was smiling, but he didn\u2019t seem that happy. Deco threw a strange glance towards Crockta, who inwardly laughed.\u00a0</span><span>Eileen said to Deco, \"The Demon's Mouth, can you show it to us?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo outsiders. It is okay with just you, but both of you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He refused with a sullen expression.\u00a0</span><span>Eileen approached and placed a hand on Deco\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m asking you Deco. Yes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ohhh...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Can\u2019t we see it for a second?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cU...Understood. But hold on a second.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Eileen smiled sweetly. Deco turned his head away.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta chuckled lowly as he watched the man and woman before him.</span></p><br/><p><span>They walked down the corridor and arrived at a firmly closed door. Warnings signs were drawn all over, as well as the words stating that entry was forbidden for those without permission.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Place this around your neck.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a necklace with divine power contained in it. Each of them received one. There was an unknown refreshing feeling coming from the necklace.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is this much necessary?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is quiet right now, but you never know.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Deco grabbed the knocker.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cNow, we will enter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The door opened.</span></p><br/><p><span>A seemingly ordinary belt made of steel was lying in the middle of the lab with various experimental instruments lined up around it. Crockta\u2019s eyes were caught by the darkness surrounding the belt. It felt like he made eye contact with something.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He seemed to hear an unknown whisper in the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe Demon's Mouth.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Deco walked.\u00a0</span><span>The belt had a transparent wall blocking access to it. There were bright lights that shone and got rid of the darkness in the room.\u00a0</span><span>Nevertheless, Crockta felt an extreme darkness from the belt.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That...it eats.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Eats?\u201d Eileen asked. </span></p><br/><p><span>Deco squirmed and said, \"Literally. It eats.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEats what?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnything alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Eileen\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>In the middle of the belt were strong steel points that looked like teeth, giving it the name of \u2018Demon\u2019s Mouth.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe center of the belt opens and eats things. A gnome has already been eaten.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oh my god...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>If so, this wasn\u2019t an artifact, but an evil creature.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The identity of it...is unknown. That is why we were studying it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at the Demon\u2019s Mouth and started thinking. What would happen if he wore that thing? Would it turn its master into a demon that desired blood?\u00a0</span><span>He got a chill and formed a fist at the words.</span></p><br/><p><span>The door behind them opened.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Eh?\"\u00a0</span><span>It was a female gnome researcher.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThis is a restricted area...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Deco gathered both hands together and laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I just wanted to quickly show it to my friends. Please overlook it this once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The female gnome alternated looking between Crockta and Eileen before giving a strange smile.\u00a0</span><span>\"I understand. I\u2019ll overlook it this time. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s time for an inspection now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Inspection time?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Deco tilted his head.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI understand. Eileen, let\u2019s leave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Deco bowed to the female gnome and directed Eileen and Crockta outside.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was about to leave the laboratory by following Deco.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Something whispered to Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta turned around.\u00a0</span><span>The Demon\u2019s Mouth was still enduring the light pouring on it.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta confirmed the appearance of the gnome researcher walking towards the Demon\u2019s Mouth. Her gait was slightly strange and somehow familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Crockta stopped.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Crockta?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Eileen called him from the doorway.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked at the female gnome without answering. He grabbed the handle of his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Call the guards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRight now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shouted loudly.\u00a0</span><span>At the same time, the head of the female gnome turned around 180\u00b0.</span></p><br/><p><span>Grotesque movements, and a mocking smile on her face.\u00a0</span><span>Doppelganger.\u00a0</span><span>The female gnome smiled before turning her head back to the front and starting to run.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta also rushed towards the doppelganger.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is a doppelganger!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Eileen and Deco panicked. It was at that moment that an alarm started to sound in the laboratory.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEverybody evacuate! Evacuate!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Someone shouted from the end of the corridor. It was the voice of the guards.\u00a0</span><span>\"A wyvern has appeared and the academy is being attacked by monsters! Run away. Evacuate! This is an emergency situation! We must evacuate now!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Eileen called out to Crockta, \u201cCrockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta didn\u2019t look back. Deco tugged at the hem of her clothes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Eileen! We have to run away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But Crockta...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She could see Crockta aiming his greatsword towards the doppelganger. The doppelganger was stuck to the transparent wall like it was being drawn towards the Demon\u2019s Mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The door of the laboratory closed.\u00a0</span><span>The inside of the laboratory couldn\u2019t be seen anymore. Eileen was dragged out by Deco.\u00a0</span><span>Her mouth gaped open as the scenery of the academy was revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh my god!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Unbelievable...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Eileen and Deco moaned at the same time.\u00a0</span><span>There were monsters were walking around the academy campus, trolls chasing after the gnomes, and ogres aiming their clubs at their surroundings.</span></p><br/><p><em><span>Kuuong!</span></em></p><br/><p><span>A troll dropped from the sky.\u00a0</span><span>They raised their heads.\u00a0</span><span>Wyverns were flying around in the sky. Wyverns were flying from far away and dropping monsters on the academy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh my...</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is impossible.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a sight they were seeing for the first time.\u00a0</span><span>After they finished transporting the goods, the wyverns descended to the ground to look for their prey. They captured gnomes and flew them up into the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSteady yourself!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The guards led Eileen and Deco to a safe place, but they were soon blocked by creatures.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>A troll carrying a stone axe drooled at them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We need to get through! Shoot!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The defenders lifted their magic guns and fired, but that firepower wasn\u2019t enough to kill the troll.\u00a0</span><span>As the troll stalled them, an ogre was drawn by the sound of the gunshots.\u00a0</span><span>The ogre lifted the broken debris of a building, a massive piece of rock, and took a position to throw it at the group.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Despair filled Eileen and Deco\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span>A ray of light struck the ogre in the back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuweeeh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogre fell down with the rock falling on it.\u00a0</span><span>Eileen looked back and saw a small gnome pointing a long gun from a distance.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That will sting you!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Captain Tiyo, the symbol of the Quantes\u2019 Gnomes Garrison.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!

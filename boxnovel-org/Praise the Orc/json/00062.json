Gradually, his footsteps became heavy and the darkness that couldn\u2019t be repulsed swallowed his whole body. Moans were heard inside the darkness. An abyss.</span></p><br/><p><span>His flesh would be erased.\u00a0</span><span>Only his spirit moved in the darkness. He couldn\u2019t tell if he was seeing darkness, or if his vision was so broken that he couldn\u2019t recognize anything. He felt drowsy.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then someone said.</span></p><br/><p><span>'The world is a parabola.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>A single ray of light emerged in the darkness.\u00a0</span><span>It was small and slender, like a firefly, as it moved in a gentle curve.</span></p><br/><p><span>'Everything that rises will eventually sink.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The light fell down.\u00a0</span><span>There were no traces of it left.\u00a0</span><span>It became dark again like there had been nothing there from the beginning.</span></p><br/><p><span>'It is small.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>'It blows away like dust in a void.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was standing now. He raised his gaze.\u00a0</span><span>It was a battlefield.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018That is the world.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The sky was red. The ground was black. In this place where the boundary between heaven and earth were broken, many people were killed. Orcs and humans rushed towards each other in a confrontation. It was a strange war filled with the living and the dead.</span></p><br/><p><span>A human screamed in pain.\u00a0</span><span>His head flew through the air.\u00a0</span><span>The orc who cut at him roared.\u00a0</span><span>Then a sword was stuck in the back of his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>Blades crossed.\u00a0</span><span>There was a rain of blood.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gradually, it started moving further away. The terrible battlefield moved further towards the horizon. The continent was seen on the horizon and then the sea was seen. The outline of a round planet appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the view of a star that didn\u2019t care about the cries of small beings.\u00a0</span><span>But the view kept on endlessly expanding.</span></p><br/><p><span>The galaxy.\u00a0</span><span>The endless darkness and dust of the galaxy appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span>The universe.\u00a0</span><span>Everything faded for a while.\u00a0</span><span>Even that just became a dot.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018The world is just an empty place.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Life and death were just fleeting moments.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s soul rattled as the darkness and void enveloped his mind. Depression, emptiness, and resignation pulled him towards hell.\u00a0</span><span>He kept falling.\u00a0</span><span>Even this rise and fall was pointless.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, someone called out to him, \"Oppa, what are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jung Ian shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Huh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jung Ian looked around.\u00a0</span><span>This was Caf\u00e9 Reason.\u00a0</span><span>Ah, that's right. After finishing school, Jung Yiyu had come to the caf\u00e9 to play and asked him for a latte. For a moment, he had a different thought.\u00a0</span><span>Jung Yiyu narrowed her eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What were you thinking?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUhh...nothing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You should focus, Boss,\u201d Jung Yiyu said with a smile. Ian laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then her face melted and her flesh dripped down her chin. As Jung Ian looked at her, she became a skeleton.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Jung Ian freaked out and retreated.</span></p><br/><p><span>'When it comes to life, everything sinks eventually.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The skeletal Jung Yiyu cocked her head. Jung Ian staggered as he could no longer control his body.\u00a0</span><span>Suddenly, a voice was heard from next to him, \"Boss, what are you doing now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Han Yeori\u2019s voice. Jung Ian stuttered as he grabbed her arm.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yeori, you see, now, Yiyu...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His fingers touched something cold.\u00a0</span><span>His head became blank as a collection of white bones smiled at him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018I see life and I laugh death and I cry. Life is truly a fleeting moment while death is an eternity.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Jung Ian froze as the world came tumbling down.\u00a0</span><span>In the infinite time, he sank into eternal darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span>Life.</span></p><br/><p><span>An unlimited void caught up.\u00a0</span><span>He held onto his hair as he shook his head and stared into the core of darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Look.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>'This is the world.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>The boundaries were crumbling.\u00a0</span><span>Once again, Crockta stood in the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Demon\u2019s Mouth was smiling at his waist.\u00a0</span><span>A perverted consciousness that melted in with the darkness. He had to overcome it. No, winning or losing was pointless at this moment, as any thoughts fled into the emptiness of the void.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta dropped his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>The \u2018it\u2019 on his waist constantly whispered to him about the notion of emptiness.\u00a0</span><span>The malice and emptiness mixed up in his head. It felt like his body was going to burst. His blood vessels enlarged and he vomited.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s soul screamed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018The world is a void.\u2019</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo ran towards the bunker with the defenders.</span></p><br/><p><span>All of a sudden, the ogres had become silent. The wyverns stopped. The creatures stood still and looked somewhere.\u00a0</span><span>Despite his confusion, Tiyo quickly led the guards. The defenders moved in unison under his leadership.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The creatures have become silent all of a sudden! This is an opportunity </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Evacuate!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnomes ran.\u00a0</span><span>They were approaching the building where the bunker was located when the ground shook.</span></p><br/><p><em><span>Kuuong!</span></em></p><br/><p><span>The running gnomes lost their balance and fell. Only Tiyo barely managed to keep his balance as he encouraged the soldiers.\u00a0</span><span>He looked behind him.\u00a0</span><span>Something was walking towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span>The person was big but smaller than an ogre. He looked familiar but also strange. Green skin, a tough face, and tough body. He was holding a greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>It was Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>But Tiyo instinctively recoiled. It was Crockta\u2019s shape but he looked different. An unknown dark aura was coming from him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes were tinged red.\u00a0</span><span>Creatures like ogres and trolls were walking behind him. The wyverns hovered over Crockta\u2019s head and made a bizarre sound.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta pointed towards Tiyo and the gnome garrison.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the creatures started to rush at them. The ground shook as the ogres rushed towards them.\u00a0</span><span>The gnomes couldn\u2019t regroup so they failed to resist.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo also dropped the muzzle of General.\u00a0</span><span>Resistance was futile.</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogres surrounded the gnomes. They opened a path. Crockta was walking over from the distance. As if he was the ruler, the creatures moved according to his gestures.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo discovered the belt around Crockta\u2019s waist.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Everything made sense.\u00a0</span><span>That was the problem. It was due to the cursed artifact that all the monsters became wild and invaded the city.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta discovered it first and tried to fight against the Demon\u2019s Mouth for Quantes, but he was eaten by it.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo gritted his teeth as he grasped General. The muzzle flashed before the ogres could react.\u00a0</span><span>However, Crockta instantly swung the greatsword and blocked the magic bullet. The bullets were deflected.</span></p><br/><p><span>An ogre waved its hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ack!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo\u2019s small body flew through the air at the ogre\u2019s punch.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t let the queasiness stop him from raising his head.\u00a0</span><span>The orc was looking down at him. Crockta\u2019s red eyes weren\u2019t those of the honorable warrior Crockta that he knew.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGrrrr...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He had been devoured by the evil of the artifact.\u00a0</span><span>He raised his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo closed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment that the greatsword was about to fall,</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe are orcs... The mighty orcs...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The greatsword hesitated.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo kept singing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe great warriors have appeared...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the orc sound that Crockta had drunkenly sung for Tiyo and the Quantes garrison.\u00a0</span><span>It was beyond ridiculous.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Humans get lost, elves get lost, dwarves get lost... Gnomes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s greatsword trembled. Tiyo opened his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s distorted face was visible.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo laughed, \"What are you doing Crockta?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t you have to go somewhere?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The greatsword paused in the air and didn\u2019t move. It shook like he was fighting something invisible.\u00a0</span><span>Soon, the steel teeth on the belt at Crockta\u2019s waist started moving.</span></p><br/><p><span>The teeth slowly opened.\u00a0</span><span>Since there was a crisis, the belt was trying to swallow the foolish gnome that shook its host.</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment that the steel teeth moved to cover the gnome.\u00a0</span><span>The greatsword moved.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta groaned from within the abyss.</span></p><br/><p><span>The demon within the Demon\u2019s mouth constantly whispered to him. Everything he deemed important was collapsing.\u00a0</span><span>The demon fed on his despair and dominated his body. He was faintly aware that he was trying to kill Tiyo with his greatsword. But Crockta thought that it might be better.</span></p><br/><p><span>People would just die anyway.\u00a0</span><span>However, Crockta temporarily regained control of his body as the greatsword moved towards Tiyo\u2019s body. He resisted the demon but it continued to whisper things to Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>His soul was suffering.\u00a0</span><span>Physical pain was nothing compared to the pain of the soul.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta's spirit was broken. The demon at his waist opened and was trying to swallow Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta moaned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Strength.\"\u00a0</span><span>Crockta kept repeating it.\u00a0</span><span>\"Don\u2019t give in.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Whoever, please give me strength.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, a brilliant light burst out. It was a radiance that seemed to blind him. Crockta closed his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Then he opened them again.\u00a0</span><span>There was a familiar face standing in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hey, it\u2019s been a while, Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was him, the hawk of the north.\u00a0</span><span>The blue guardian of the sunrise. The pale blue standard bearer who guided the shamans. The orc shaman mentor.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was Tashaquil.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You\u2019ve been doing great things. Kulkulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil waved his staff.\u00a0</span><span>The world became still. It was the same for the Demon\u2019s Mouth and the fallen Tiyo before him.\u00a0</span><span>It was like looking at a stalled scene from the perspective of a third party.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTashaquil, how are you here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t be surprised. I\u2019m not Tashaquil. It is like a residual piece he left behind... In reality, I am probably at Orcrox or Basque Village.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He laughed as he touched the Demon\u2019s Mouth with his staff.\u00a0</span><span>\"Have you forgotten? I gave you a power the day you left Orcrox.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The memory of that day was revived.\u00a0</span><span>Tashaquil had cast a spell when Crockta was saying goodbye to him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Tashaquil has granted you an unknown power.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018The unidentified power will settle within your body.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018One day it will help you.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Now he remembered.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta asked, \"Tashaquil, what should I do now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let\u2019s see...I don\u2019t know.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil laughed, \"Actually, it was a lie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is no power in this spell to help you Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil waved his staff and smiled.\u00a0</span><span>\"Just when the time comes, I am supposed to tell you what you want to hear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tell me what I want to hear?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta still had no idea.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What do you want me to say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you want to be comfortable, you can relax your mind.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He pointed to the Demon\u2019s Mouth and said.\u00a0</span><span>\"That is too strong. You have done your best so you can rest comfortably. What about this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He seemed to be laughing. \u00a0</span><span>Crockta frowned and asked, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oh, that wasn\u2019t it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tashaquil swung his staff and hit Crockta\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ouch!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then I can say only one thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat is it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It\u2019s the same if I were any other orc. There is only one word I can give you now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Didn\u2019t he already know it? Tashaquil laughed.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta raised his gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Listen carefully.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI'll only say it once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta listened closely.\u00a0</span><span>Then Tashaquil spoke.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Just like it was alive, the demon\u2019s teeth protruded from the steel belt and prepared to bite Tiyo\u2019s throat.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s greatsword struck it.</span></p><br/><p><em><span>Kakang!</span></em></p><br/><p><span>The Demon\u2019s Mouth twisted. Then the steel teeth twisted and gave a strange shout.\u00a0</span><span>It was a terrible cry that sounded like it came from purgatory.\u00a0</span><span>Then the belt twisted like a snake and aimed at Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stretched out and grabbed it. The steel teeth chewed in vain in front of Crockta\u2019s face.\u00a0</span><span>Furious noises kept coming from it.\u00a0</span><span>But Crockta just smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you afraid of the void?\u201d Crockta asked.\u00a0</span><span>The Demon\u2019s Mouth made a strange sound and tried to bite Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\"Are you afraid of the death that you will meet someday?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><em><span>Kaaaaaaah!</span></em></p><br/><p><span>\"Is that why you tease people like this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Demon\u2019s Mouth bit Crockta\u2019s arm.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta groaned but didn\u2019t let it go. Crockta swallowed back the pain and said.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will give you the answer that you want to hear.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Darkness emerged from the Demon\u2019s Mouth and covered Crockta. His vision became dark.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta faced the darkness once again.\u00a0</span><span>The darkness vibrated and threatened Crockta, but Crockta didn\u2019t waver.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he said, \"The world isn\u2019t a void.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It stopped.\u00a0</span><span>The darkness became thinner.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta continued speaking, \"Even if the world will end someday, life isn\u2019t meaningless.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The darkness shouted, \u2018What do you mean?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t this the answer that you wanted to hear?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stared at the other side of the darkness.\u00a0</span><span>Now he could see it clearly.\u00a0</span><span>It hid in the darkness and yelled, but it was actually crouching down from fear.\u00a0</span><span>It witnessed the end of the world, the darkness of the universe, and became frightened by it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will tell you again. Death isn\u2019t the end.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It turned to face Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>It said, \u2018Prove it.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018You tell me!\u2019\u00a0</span><span>It stood up and shouted at Crockta, like a young child of the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you want to know?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It didn't answer.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta said, \u201cThen follow me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018What?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you follow me, then I will prove it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018......\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta spoke firmly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"My life.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It tilted its head.\u00a0</span><span>A fine movement.

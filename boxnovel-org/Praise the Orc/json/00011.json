Lenox nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I sent him to Hoyt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hoyt... I haven\u2019t heard that name in a long time. Has he been doing well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He\u2019s gone away this time because he became friends with a human.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuman...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The shaman touched his chin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It isn\u2019t good to become entangled with them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I hope the human he called friend is a man of honor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A few warriors greeted the shaman.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTashaquil! Are you alive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oh, I\u2019m alive. Bul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tashaquil!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil smiled and nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hey, everyone\u2019s alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Just like Lenox was the instructor for the warriors in Orcrox Fortress, Tashaquil was the teacher for the shamans.</span></p><br/><p><span>Beginner orcs often met with either Lenox or Tashaquil. The system determined the user\u2019s alignment and suggested the way best suited for them. They were the two NPCs that could be called the starting point of the hell species.</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox stared at a collapsed warrior who jumped to his feet and started moving again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see you\u2019re still strict.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m treating them as warriors.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox laughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGrant sent me a letter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Grant? Didn\u2019t he become a farmer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe did.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I was expecting him to give up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe selected that life for himself.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At the time the Mutant Hunt quest was received, the system said that the compensation would depend on their performance.\u00a0</span><span>Ian and Grom didn\u2019t know it, but the letter Grant wrote to Lenox resulted in a far bigger reward.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil waved his staff and a blessing covered the orcs practicing at the training grounds. The warriors shouted their gratitude to Tashaquil.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That blunt person wrote a letter. What does it say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He gave me his regards and talked about the rookie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He met the rookie?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. I told them to help the orc farmers as a whole, but they ended up meeting Grant instead.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat\u2019d he say?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That he\u2019ll be a good warrior.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA good warrior...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil started thinking.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I have seen many warriors. Good warriors as well. But not all good warriors go the same way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil smiled and nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"So you sent him to Hoyt?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hoyt is an honorable man.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It\u2019s enough as long as the rookie doesn\u2019t forget the path of honor.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That is your answer, Lenox.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>At that time, an orc appeared in front of Lenox\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span>With a lousy rushing gait, it was Grom. Lenox laughed bitterly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There\u2019s another rookie.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis one?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He isn\u2019t reliable, but he\u2019s coming along well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox called out to Grom.\u00a0</span><span>Grom jumped. He became tense as he discovered Tashaquil, who had a fierce atmosphere similar to Lenox, standing on Lenox\u2019s other side. Tashaquil waved his staff.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am alive. I am Tashaquil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am alive! Are you the shaman instructor?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You know me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom initially worried about whether he should become a warrior or a shaman.\u00a0</span><span>In fact, the system had proposed becoming a shaman, and told him to go to Basque Village to find the shaman Tashaquil.\u00a0</span><span>However, Grom himself chose to become a warrior.</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox told Grom, \"The mission to help Grant turned out well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But I'm still not satisfied. Are you satisfied?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, no!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. Never be satisfied with the present. I will give you a mission.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Alone...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom had learned through a whisper that Ian was on a solo quest.\u00a0</span><span>This would be the first quest that he proceeded on alone without Ian. In fact, it was thanks to Ian that Grom had made most of his progress as an orc. If it wasn\u2019t for Ian, then he would\u2019ve already quit.</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc really was a hell species!\u00a0</span><span>What quest would he have to do alone? Grom gulped.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"These days, a group of goblins are threatening the orcs. Go with the warriors to clean them up. Fight together.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUh, when?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNow!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox pointed behind Grom.\u00a0</span><span>There were a series of warriors holding weapons. They grinned as they gestured to him. It was a fearsome sight to behold.\u00a0</span><span>Grom seemed like he was about to cry.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand... Uhh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tashaquil laughed as he watched Grom walking away.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat guy\u2019s going to be a warrior?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anyone can become a warrior.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul. Indeed...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tashaquil, a warrior isn\u2019t born, but made.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are still a romantic.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I just believe.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I believe in the possibilities of all orcs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian walked around Anail.</span></p><br/><p><span>Once he became recognized as an orc warrior someday, he would leave Orcrox Fortress and meet various other species.\u00a0</span><span>Just like he admired Orcrox\u2019s scenery, Anail was overflowing with NPCs with their own intelligence and personality.</span></p><br/><p><span>In addition to the merchants at the market welcoming customers, he also saw the mercenaries of Elder Lord who would do anything for money.\u00a0</span><span>Orcs were rare in Anail, so Ian gladly bumped fists with them every time he met one.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hey, are you alive?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m alive!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is the first time I\u2019ve seen you. A warrior?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m still an apprentice. Shaman?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, no, no. I am the much cooler warlock compared to a shaman.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOhh... This is the first time I\u2019ve seen an orc warlock.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t reduce the honor of the warlocks. I am a warlock.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul. I\u2019ll be careful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is nice to meet you, Warrior. Warriors can be called the pride of the orcs. Become a warrior who knows honor, young man.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand. Bul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The citizens glanced over at the two big orcs saying goodbye on the street.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s childhood memories returned as he wandered around the market.\u00a0</span><span>It was fun to follow his parents around at the market when they were alive. When they saw the young Ian, the adults at the market would give him something to eat.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Purchase radish! Selling radish! Purchase radish! Purcha....eh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A woman screaming while holding a radish in both hands noticed Ian and her eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at her as well.\u00a0</span><span>There was a white star in the middle of her forehead.\u00a0</span><span>A user.\u00a0</span><span>It was the first user he met apart from Grom.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA user?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Whoa, this is the first time I\u2019ve seen an orc user. Wah, wah.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She examined Ian with amazement.\u00a0</span><span>As she reached out to touch Ian, she realized that she was holding radishes in both hands and stopped.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you want to buy a radish?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul. It\u2019s okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She laid down the radishes with regret-filled eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is really the first time I\u2019ve seen an orc user. \u00a0Have you been playing for a long time?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Not that long. I\u2019m a beginner.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see. You should try a different race. I have friends who tried being an orc, and they all ended up quitting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are like a real orc.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A woman was selling a variety of vegetables on her own, with a sign saying \u2018Anail Branch of the Blacksmith Company\u2019 in front of her.\u00a0</span><span>Her eyes widened as she noticed where Ian was paying attention.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ahem, I am the successful applicant for the intern position at Blacksmith Company.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIntern?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t ignore the interns. The Blacksmith Company is a large business in Elder Lord.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Even in games, the preference for large companies remained.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m going to become a legend of the business world and appear in [Elder Lord Times].\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Elder Lord Times] was a program that talked about news in Elder Lord, as well as the rankers. Ian had watched videos of Elder Lord through this program before starting Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Orc, what is your profession?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA warrior, although I am still an apprentice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Truly an orc. How tough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The woman sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s good that I don\u2019t have to worry about fighting. But I have to sell all of this today...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She glanced at Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you busy?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not busy but...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Now was his free time. Hoyt told Ian to explore the city.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen please help me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>[Stella has suggested a quest.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[The pay will be according to the results. There is a base salary of 5 silver and you will receive 30% of Stella\u2019s dividends, depending on the sales performance.]</span></p><br/><p><span>Stella\u2019s quest!\u00a0</span><span>This was the first time he discovered that users could grant a quest. Ian looked at the woman, Stella, who was gazing at him earnestly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m an intern. If my performance isn\u2019t good then I can\u2019t switch to being a full-time employee!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the sad reality.\u00a0</span><span>Anyway, it seemed fun so Ian nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Did you see my name in the quest window? I am Stella. Orc, what is your name?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am Ian.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That isn\u2019t an orc-like name.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, Ian started to help Stella with her business.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Purchase radish! Buy carrots! Selling cucumbers!\u201d Stella yelled loudly. Unbecoming of her slim figure, she yelled like an amazon, but nobody looked back.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian watched Stella.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Excuse me, Mister! Do you need a radish? This is a radish, a delicious radish! You can boil it, cook it, or even sell it! Buy it!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m not buying, not buying.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The aunty over there! Carrots! It\u2019s great for your body! Good for your eyes, and rich in beta-carotene. Even children like them! Carrots are great, Aunty!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"My kids hate carrots.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The pretty sister over there! Elf sister! Sister, do you like green peppers? Sister, how about a basket of green peppers?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...Step aside.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian shook his head. Stella looked over at Ian with tearful eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat? You\u2019re just watching and not helping. Do you think you\u2019ll be better than me at this job?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t it just selling?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, I went to a private school in order to pass the interview to enter the Blacksmith Company.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"School?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There are many special schools for Elder Lord.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>If there were private schools for games, it would surely be in South Korea.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m broke because I used my salary to pay for the private school\u2019s fees...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was reminded of Yiyu when he saw Stella. </span><span>Ian sighed and said, \u201cOkay. I will lend you my strength.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Bah, will Ian\u2019s strength make a difference? Will it turn carrots into beef? You would be a wealthy merchant.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Desperate words poured out of Stella\u2019s mouth as she started talking. Ian placed a dirt-covered carrot in her mouth.\u00a0</span><span>She tried to speak while spitting it ot.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Wha for?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Stella, please remember this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian puffed up his chest. He was a dignified and honourable orc.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you want to grab the mind of a person, be aware that 70% of communication is through non-verbal behaviour, not words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian moved Stella out of the way and sat down.\u00a0</span><span>The people passing by looked at the orc sitting in front of a vegetable shop like he was a spectacle. Ian didn't say anything.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, he caught the eyes of a passerby.\u00a0</span><span>The man flinched at Ian\u2019s intense gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span>Green skin, grim expression, protruding fangs, and the huge size. It was a scary appearance. The man became nervous as Ian paid strong attention to him.\u00a0</span><span>An orc acting as a substitute in the market, what the hell was this? The moment that they locked eyes, the terrible orc started to lift something up.</span></p><br/><p><span>Dagger?\u00a0</span><span>Axe?\u00a0</span><span>Hammer?\u00a0</span><span>Was he staring because he was going to do some act of violence? The man swallowed his saliva. Should he run?</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc lifted something up.\u00a0</span><span>It was nothing other than a radish.\u00a0</span><span>An orc holding a radish, it was an unusual sight. Was he an orc who would throw everything around him if he got upset? Would the radish fly over right now?</span></p><br/><p><span>His eyes looked down.\u00a0</span><span>As the man tried to bow his head, something unbelievable happened.</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc placed the radish near his face and gently smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the orc spoke in a loud voice, \"Radish.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you need one?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Did he need a radish?\u00a0</span><span>The man didn\u2019t understand. However, he felt a type of strange trust from that short question. A pride that didn\u2019t need long, flowery words! The warmth that spread from a gentle smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man nodded like he was spellbound.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI need...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was nothing more to say. The man paid the money and the orc handed over the radish.\u00a0</span><span>One radish was sold.\u00a0</span><span>Stella couldn\u2019t understand why the man bought the radish and what this whole thing meant for her.</span></p><br/><p><span>After the man bought the radish from the orc, people started to show interest.\u00a0</span><span>Another man walked up to the orc and said, \"This is the first time that I am seeing an orc vegetable dealer. Orc, how much is this onion?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at the man with blank eyes.\u00a0</span><span>It was a deep look.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...What will you do with the onion?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man rolled his eyes at the sudden question.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh? That...I don\u2019t know. My wife will take care of it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a patriarchal man who knew nothing about cooking.\u00a0</span><span>Ian shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I won\u2019t sell you the onion.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A declaration of refusal!\u00a0</span><span>The eyes of everyone watching grew bigger. What merchant would refuse to sell an item? Had the orc applied a quota to the onions?\u00a0</span><span>He was a mysterious orc vegetable seller.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Each ingredient has a value. An onion is the ultimate vegetable that can be used for all dishes. It can be used in stir-fry, steamed soup, soup, fried dishes, or as a nutritional or taste supplement. It is the guardian of the home.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cT-Then why...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will only sell it to those who understand the value of this ingredient.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The pride of the seller who would judge the buyer\u2019s qualifications!\u00a0</span><span>It was a first for the market.\u00a0</span><span>The orc vegetable seller folded his arms and didn\u2019t say anything more.</span></p><br/><p><span>The rejected man looked between the orc and the onion with devastated eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cT-Then...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A woman came forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm, he doesn\u2019t know the value of the onion at that age because he depends on his wife instead of cooking for himself. It\u2019s shameful!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She was a middle-aged woman wearing a headband. </span><span>She lifted a potato and said, \"Orc, I want to buy a basket of potatoes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What do you think I will make with this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A basket of potatoes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc vegetable seller touched his chin with a troubled expression,\u00a0</span><span>\"Hrmm...potatoes... Thinking about the health of the family...how about a boiled potato salad...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The middle-aged woman waved her fingers and said with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWrong.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then what...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The dish I will create...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She said firmly.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone was surprised by her answer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Fried potatoes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Fried...? Frying...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crispy potatoes fried in oil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Fried... Oil... Isn\u2019t this the enemy of health that causes hypertension, myocardial infarction, or obesity...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Didn\u2019t their parents and elders always tell them to boil instead of frying?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, Mister is correct. That is possible, but they are just words.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The middle-aged woman laughed at the orc vegetable seller\u2019s puzzled expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t it good to risk your health if you can know the taste of fried potatoes?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I would rather live today freely than tomorrow in caution. That is the value of the potatoes to me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was big.\u00a0</span><span>This woman...big.\u00a0</span><span>Her thoughts were bigger than his.\u00a0</span><span>She was someone who walked the path of a gourmet without any prejudice or self-righteousness.</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc vegetable seller stood up in amazement.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Rather, I have learned something from you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The world is wide, Mister Orc.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"To you...I will sell three baskets instead of just one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll willingly accept.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Thus, the middle-aged woman left with three baskets of potatoes.\u00a0</span><span>The people who witnessed the encounter came up to the orc seller and started conveying their beliefs.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will make a soup with the carrots. The color will hide the identity for my children who don\u2019t like carrots. It is my small consideration for the dark knight at the table.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Give me an onion.

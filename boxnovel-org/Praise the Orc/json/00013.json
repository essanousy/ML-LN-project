He swallowed back the pain and bandaged the wounds with the clothes of the user hunters.\u00a0</span><span>He scanned the equipment and found nothing special. They were the ordinary clothes and weapons sold at the blacksmiths. All of them had the Common rating.</span></p><br/><p><span>He grabbed the spear, the swords, and the staff, since they could be sold. Ian and raised his head and saw an empty, vacant lot.

Brown. Eri. They were user hunters active in the Anail area, and were known to attack anyone, regardless of whether they were beginners or not.\u00a0</span><span>They used a friendly approach to get close to the user, only to stab them in the back and gain their items and achievement points.\u00a0</span><span>They aimed solely at users that weren\u2019t familiar with combat. Therefore, there were complaints about the trio of killers.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, they hit an orc NPC by accident and suffered.</span></p><br/><p><span>The battle scene was amazing.\u00a0</span><span>A boldness that the users couldn\u2019t follow!

The scenes of them ambushing a user, only to be killed, would be an explosive hit.\u00a0</span><span>She didn\u2019t know why, but it seemed like they had mistaken the NPC for a user.</span></p><br/><p><span>She nodded as she checked the video that she recorded.\u00a0</span><span>People would go crazy over it. The sight of wicked people forgetting themselves and falling into the pit of hell.\u00a0</span><span>There was even a nice soliloquy of justice!</span></p><br/><p><span>She glanced around as she ended the connection.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Jungtae smiled as he heard Yiyu\u2019s voice next to him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey, Park Jungtae.

After their economics lecture ended, they decided to spend some time together.\u00a0</span><span>As the two of them were talking, someone called out Yiyu\u2019s name.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, Yiyu! Jung Yiyu!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Park Jungtae as well?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A group of girls rushed over and sat at their table.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are the two of you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIsn\u2019t this strange? Perhaps? Jungtae, wow~ Park Jungtae, not bad~.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu laughed, \"If you are just here to talk nonsense, then leave.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t that too harsh? Do you want me to keep calling you Rabbit? Didn\u2019t a rabbit give you a hard time?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, noisy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After Yiyu died from a rabbit in Elder Lord, her friends kept on calling her Rabbit.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBy the way, have you seen it?\u201d Her friend asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Youvidser Laney\u2019s video.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Youvidser.

Of course, even in Youvids, most of the mainstream content was related to Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>Laney was a star who emerged after reporting on various types of wicked players, filming their wickedness in gruesome detail.\u00a0</span><span>Rumor has it that the users captured on video weren\u2019t even aware of Laney\u2019s existence because she was such a high level assassin.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSeen what?\u201d Yiyu asked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Look look, it is a bit hit.

That is incorrect! An NPC!]</span></p><br/><p><span>It became a 2 vs 1 fight.\u00a0</span><span>The user hunters were familiar with fighting, so they attacked the orc pretty well. The orc went on the defensive.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t the orc losing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is coming soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that time, the woman stabbed the orc with a short sword.\u00a0</span><span>The orc was waiting for that moment and cut the female hunter\u2019s torso.\u00a0</span><span>The user hunter\u2019s body was split in half.</span></p><br/><p><span>Yiyu flinched as she watched the brutal scene.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI can see the flesh and bones.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Jungtae admired the sight.\u00a0</span><span>The woman\u2019s body was broken and the lone spearman soon fell down.

Rather, the user hunters were superior in power. However, the skill and the boldness of the orc overwhelmed them.\u00a0</span><span>It was truly a fierce battle!</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is why you shouldn\u2019t touch NPCs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The corpses of the users turned white and disappeared.\u00a0</span><span>The orc grabbed their weapons and stood still.\u00a0</span><span>The video didn\u2019t end there.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...There\u2019s more?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Listen carefully.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc stood there, looking into the air.\u00a0</span><span>Then the orc opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>-Today, I met three wicked people and killed them, implementing justice.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The orc formed a fist.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>-Where are the people who know honor?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>It was a loud voice.\u00a0</span><span>The orc disappeared into the darkness of the city after speaking.</span></p><br/><p><span>Park Jungtae and Yiyu\u2019s mouths dropped open.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Amazing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...Really cool.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>An unknown spirit was blazing from him!\u00a0</span><span>There was an explosion of comments.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2514 Elder Lord\u2019s Path: I\u2019m going to become an orc.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u00a0 \u2514 Arigato: 222222. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u00a0 \u2514 I am the Best: 222222. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u00a0 \u2514 Cooking Fondant: 222222. </span></p><br/><p><span>\u00a0 \u00a0\u2514Woo In-sung\u2019s Secret: 2222\u3160\u315c</span></p><br/><p><span>\u00a0 \u2514 (View more)</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2514 My name is Yoda: We are going crazy;;;; Protect honor;;</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2514 Assassination King: I have to reevaluate hunting orc users.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2514 Dragon Bra: It\u2019s just a staged scene \u3139\u3147</span></p><br/><p><span>\u00a0 \u2514 Ninano: He really seems like a NPC ;;; An orc who clears houses.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2514 Orc Hunter: An orc is a mob.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u00a0 \u2514 Number 1 Orc User Maguchwi: Dirty humans!!

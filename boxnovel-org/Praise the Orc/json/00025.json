It seems that the \u2018r\u2019 ending has been omitted, and has now become the present form, Bul\u2019ta.</span></p><br/><p><span>The ancient orc word Bul\u2019tar has both the most complex and subtle meanings. In universal terms, it refers to survival and life; however, in contextual terms, it sometimes symbolizes the most important thing or something of high value that the orc must fulfill in life.</span></p><br/><p><span>It isn\u2019t easy to interpret this word in the continent\u2019s language, because it has a variety of meanings. In the case of the former, it is possible to replace the word with \u2018life\u2019 and \u2018survival\u2019. However, the problem becomes more complicated in the latter meaning. This is because there is no word to describe it in the official language of the continent.</span></p><br/><p><span>It is a word that collectively refers to life, morality, goals, dreams, and the most important things in life. Understand this word is the most critical and difficult task when studying the culture and philosophy of the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>I have met countless orcs. As I moved among them, I could feel the true meaning of Bul\u2019tar.\u00a0</span><span>Despite the gap between the two different languages, if there is a way to express it in our current language, then I would like to do so.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the ancient orc language, Bul\u2019tar is life.\u00a0</span><span>Life is \u2018honor\u2019 to the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>For them, life is the process of realizing honor, and honor is the sum of the most important values of their lives. This orc belief is solemn and religious. Therefore, Bul\u2019tar is life, and is separate from the will of survival.</span></p><br/><p><span>-Elliot De Pontian (The Cultural Philosophy of Each Tribe\u2019s Ancient Language)</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs took the offensive against the death knights, Hoyt and Lenox dealing with one knight each.\u00a0</span><span>Only they could fight easily against the death knights. Lenox\u2019s axe split apart a death knight. Black smoke emerged from the death knight\u2019s body and healed the wound.</span></p><br/><p><span>The fight started up again.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian regained his spirit. He thought that he had sliced the death knight, but his sword just bounced off.</span></p><br/><p><span>They truly were death knights.\u00a0</span><span>If so, how strong was the master of the dungeon, the one who controlled them?</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox laughed in delight.\u00a0</span><span>It was a thunderous sound. At that moment, Lenox\u2019s body blazed with a white glow as his body moved at an unseen pace.</span></p><br/><p><span>The death knight was also covered by a black energy, becoming a dark figure.\u00a0</span><span>The two exchanged invisible attacks with only the spectacular flashes of light and the metallic clang as the two weapons collided a few dozen times in a few minutes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s mouth dropped open. The darkness started to become diluted with light under Lenox\u2019s glorious axe. Every time his attack hit, a scream emerged from the mouth of the death knight.</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt also slammed his hammer down and the head of the death knight that he was facing was smashed apart. Darkness flowed from the wound, but it couldn\u2019t endure against the torrent of attacks. Hoyt\u2019s hammer slammed against the death knight\u2019s body several times.</span></p><br/><p><span>The remaining death knight collapsed under the attacks of all of the orc warriors and their attacks that were blessed by the shamans. Kinjur shouted as he waved his staff, Lightning striking the fallen death knight.</span></p><br/><p><span>The death knight got up for a final hurrah., rushing towards the orcs in a broken state. It was a threatening attack.\u00a0</span><span>The battle continued again, but in the end, it was the orcs\u2019 victory.</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs took deep breaths.\u00a0</span><span>Another battle was imminent. Lenox had minor injuries while Hoyt sprinkled potions in his wounds. Other orcs moaned from their injuries.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gulda approached and placed a hand on Ian\u2019s shoulder. His breathing was rough. However, he laughed excitedly as he panted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuhahahal! Apprentice! Good fight!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But he wasn\u2019t as wild as usual. Ian turned to him.\u00a0</span><span>Blood was flowing from a deep stab wound in Gulda\u2019s chest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it Apprentice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBut...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t enough to stop Gulda. Kuhahal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gulda\u2019s eyes turned towards the huge door.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe dirty undead bastards won\u2019t be able to stop me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox organized the troops.\u00a0</span><span>Once again, a large number of orcs were unable to fight.\u00a0</span><span>For the first time, a few deaths occurred.\u00a0</span><span>The fight against the death knights was the most intense one. One of the death knights had even infiltrated the shamans and slaughtered them.</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs closed their eyes at the bodies of the dead orcs. There was a short moment of silence. Another fight was imminent. After the battle, they would hold proper funerals for the honorable warriors.</span></p><br/><p><span>The wounded left, carrying their comrade\u2019s corpses on their backs.\u00a0</span><span>Now there were only a small number of orcs left.</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox looked around.\u00a0</span><span>The warriors and shamans, including Ian and Grom, nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the final stage.\u00a0</span><span>Lenox pushed open the door.</span></p><br/><p><span>The huge door slowly opened with a strange sound. The door opened and revealed the shadow of a person.\u00a0</span><span>A magician with his back to them.</span></p><br/><p><span>He slowly turned around.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Under his hood was the bizarre appearance of a \u00a0rotting face that seemed to be holding on by force. Bones and rotten flesh could be seen through his robe.</span></p><br/><p><span>He discovered the orcs.\u00a0</span><span>Mocking laughter filled the air.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuhuhuhu. In the end you came here, foolish orcs...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Lich, don\u2019t interfere with the rest of the dead.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Lenox stepped forward and lifted his axe.\u00a0</span><span>\"The person who goes against providence will be quickly taken care of.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You really don\u2019t know anything...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The lich walked out.</span></p><br/><p><span>His appearance was fully revealed under the blazing torches.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You orcs... You are naive...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The lich wasn\u2019t in a normal state.\u00a0</span><span>A blue glowing dagger was stabbed in his chest.\u00a0</span><span>The life vessel inside the heart was pierced and had a black glow around it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anyway, I also... I... Just being used...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What does that mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They will come soon.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The lich laughed again.\u00a0</span><span>It was at that moment.</span></p><br/><p><em><span>Step.</span></em><em><span>Step.</span></em><em><span>Step.</span></em><em><span>Step.</span></em></p><br/><p><span>Footsteps were heard.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn't the sound of one or two footsteps.\u00a0</span><span>It was the sound of many troops marching in unison.\u00a0</span><span>The orcs looked behind them.\u00a0</span><span>From the invisible end of the tunnel, fully armed human soldiers were moving towards them. It was an infantry unit wearing iron armor. They came through the front door.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou were right,\u201d a human male who led the unit said.\u00a0</span><span>He wore a helmet with blue eyes shining from within it.\u00a0</span><span>\"It is easy to get the captain of the disgusting orcs here with a bait.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man burst out laughing. His laugh rang throughout the dungeon.\u00a0</span><span>The magician standing next to the man nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I told you, everything would go the way I planned.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The magician looked at the orcs with pleased eyes and slowly took off the hood attached to the robe.\u00a0</span><span>He shook his sweaty hair off his face.\u00a0</span><span>A white star was revealed on his forehead.\u00a0</span><span>A magician user.</span></p><br/><p><span>The magician asked, \u201cHow about it, isn\u2019t it like I said?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is accurate.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is a link between those who have been cursed by the stars. Communicating with the hidden spy is the easiest thing to do.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWonderful. I will remember this merit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you. Hahahaha!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>What were they talking about?</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s eyes widened.\u00a0</span><span>It was a story that he didn\u2019t want to believe, but Ian clearly saw it.\u00a0</span><span>Grom was slowly moving towards them.</span></p><br/><p><span>The magician called out, \"Hey, Hyunchul! Come here!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Good work buddy. Now I will push you forward.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Grom ran and stood beside the humans.\u00a0</span><span>He looked down and avoided the gaze of the orcs. The magician user struck his shoulder.\u00a0</span><span>\"You were dependable as an orc. Are you still going to reset?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see. Good decision. I will raise you up in the clan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian couldn't believe the sight in front of him.\u00a0</span><span>Grom had betrayed them.\u00a0</span><span>No, from the very beginning, his mission had been to infiltrate the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Earl, I did as I promised.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will reward your group. Is the quest complete?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Catching those guys will resolve it. In particular, it would be a huge achievement if we catch him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The magician\u2019s finger pointed towards Lenox.</span></p><br/><p><span>Quest.\u00a0</span><span>The instructor of the orc warriors at Orcrox Fortress.\u00a0</span><span>The great warrior Lenox.\u00a0</span><span>He was their goal.\u00a0</span><span>Defeat the orcs and kill Lenox. It was their quest, and Grom was the spy prepared for this quest. He became a warrior to gain Lenox\u2019s trust.\u00a0</span><span>The lich was just bait.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hey Lich. You can go.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuhuuuok...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The magician user chanted a spell and the blue dagger fell out of the life vessel. The lich sat on the floor and recovered his breathing.\u00a0</span><span>The lich started to run.\u00a0</span><span>There was a small door near the lich. It opened the door and ran out.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian\u2019s eyes shook.\u00a0</span><span>There was an escape route.\u00a0</span><span>They could run over there.</span></p><br/><p><span>Maybe he could buy some time.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian went to Lenox.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLenox! Over there...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But Lenox was looking elsewhere.\u00a0</span><span>Ian's eyes followed Lenox\u2019s gaze. There were familiar faces among the humans.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ahh.\u00a0</span><span>He had forgotten. \u00a0</span><span>The wounded orcs. They were already beaten and had been dragged here. They were collapsed like corpses, except they were breathing. Bleeding marks showed the path that they were pulled.</span></p><br/><p><span>The earl kicked the face of the orc that was brought to the front.\u00a0</span><span>The orc\u2019s tusks flew through the air.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDirty orc scum.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kilkilkil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Scumbags.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His kicking continued.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDie! Die!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian turned back to Lenox.\u00a0</span><span>Lenox\u2019s eyes had sunk into his sockets.\u00a0</span><span>Ian was furious, but he opened his mouth to suggest that they flee.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cApprentice,\u201d Lenox opened his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Run that way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There might be troops waiting there, but I believe in you. Survive until the end and let Orcrox know what happened.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLenox...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We will remain.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox raised his axe.\u00a0</span><span>The orc warriors simultaneously lifted their weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was ridiculous.\u00a0</span><span>The warriors were tired and wounded. The blood covering them didn\u2019t only belong to the enemy, and the difference in numbers was ridiculously huge. It was a battle between an egg and a rock.\u00a0</span><span>The orcs were about to collapse after the sheer number of battles.\u00a0</span><span>And the enemy was an army that was completely armed and hadn\u2019t lost any troops.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLenox...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian gritted his teeth. They were different from Ian, they wouldn\u2019t rise again after dying. Their deaths were a complete end.\u00a0</span><span>But he could see that Lenox wouldn\u2019t listen to his words.\u00a0</span><span>As long as there were orc warriors among the humans, nobody would turn to flee.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen I will fight.\u201d Ian declared.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will fight with you...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Lenox pushed Ian.\u00a0</span><span>Ian rolled across the ground. He sat down and shook his head. Why...?</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDon\u2019t make me laugh, Apprentice. This isn\u2019t a fight that you can take part in,\u201d Lenox said.</span></p><br/><p><span>Gulda nodded from where he was standing.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYes. Are you stupid? Don\u2019t get in the way Apprentice! Kuhahahal!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He removed his hand from his bleeding chest. That wasn\u2019t the end.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt would be a waste to use my spells on you, Apprentice.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>It was Kinjur.</span></p><br/><p><span>The other orc warriors started to open their mouths.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It seems like you\u2019are mistaken because we fought together a little bit, but you will just be an obstacle in the main fight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"In fact, we couldn\u2019t fight properly before because of you. Go right now. Flee. Kulkulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don\u2019t look too unsightly as you run away.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStop bothering Lenox and do as he says. Kulkulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Run quickly and don\u2019t get caught. I want to fight, so go right away!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tears filled Ian\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span>They might be able to live if everyone would just run away. No matter how many died, maybe some would be able to live.\u00a0</span><span>But they would stay and fight until the end.</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian shouted towards Hoyt, \u201cHoyt! What did you say? The most important thing is survival, life is the most important!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he looked at Lenox.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLenox! You must live first! Isn\u2019t our slogan Bul\u2019tar?!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He appealed to all the orcs.\u00a0</span><span>The orcs stared at Ian blankly. Then they looked at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuk...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKukuk...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The shoulders of one or two orcs started to shake.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPuhahaha! Kuahahaha!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuhahahal!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKulkulkulkul! Kulkulkulkul!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They all burst out laughing.\u00a0</span><span>The laughter of the orcs echoed throughout the dungeon.\u00a0</span><span>They laughed for a long time.\u00a0</span><span>Then the laughter stopped.</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox stared at Ian with a smile on his face.\u00a0</span><span>Then he opened his mouth, \u201cApprentice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"According to you, life is the most important thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then I'm going to ask.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox said, \u201cAre you alive right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian looked at him blankly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you living?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He couldn\u2019t understand what Lenox was talking about.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAre you alive right now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am alive.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox asked, \"Why?\"\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why are you alive? Is it because you are breathing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKeep this in mind Apprentice.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox smiled.\u00a0</span><span>All the orc warriors smiled at Ian.</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox pointed his axe at Ian.\u00a0</span><span>In Ian\u2019s eyes, Lenox\u2019s laughing face overlapped with his axe.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox shouted, \u201cKeep this in mind! Apprentice!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was just like Lenox was at the training grounds.\u00a0</span><span>\"Only this! You are breathing! But that doesn\u2019t mean you are living!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It felt like his final teachings.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cJust because you aren\u2019t dead! That doesn\u2019t mean you are living!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Ian finally realized it.\u00a0</span><span>The orc\u2019s greeting about whether a person was alive or not didn\u2019t ask sbout one\u2019s survival.\u00a0</span><span>Bul\u2019tar wasn\u2019t just a cry for life.</span></p><br/><p><span>Lenox turned around.\u00a0</span><span>The orc warriors aimed their weapons at the humans with wide smiles on their faces.\u00a0</span><span>Lenox said, \"You don\u2019t understand this, making you not qualified to fight with us. So...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, the warriors among the humans shouted and jumped up. It was a last hurrah. The ranks were disturbed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Get out now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Those were Lenox\u2019s last words.\u00a0</span><span>The orc warriors rushed in unison.\u00a0</span><span>Ian couldn\u2019t bear to look anymore.

He lied.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Ian: I live in Busan, Busan. Hahaha! Ay, come visit Busan! We have donuts and gukbap! Gukbap! Kelkelkelkel!] </span></p><br/><p><span>(TL: Ian fakes a Busan accent during this.)</span></p><br/><p><span>[Stella: Ah...I see. I thought I would ask since I know someone with the same name. How are you doing?]</span></p><br/><p><span>The messages to Stella would display the name of the caller.\u00a0</span><span>As he acted like a man who lived in Busan, Crockta hurriedly ended the conversation.\u00a0</span><span>Jung Yunji was becoming dangerous.\u00a0</span><span>He wanted to hide his identity as much as possible.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why are you so dazed? Let\u2019s go Crockta </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! The North! The unknown!\u201d Tiyo cried out as he bounced around. </span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed. He was a cute friend.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I, Tiyo, am going! Kiyoooooh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo started running ahead into a vast plain. If they looked beyond that horizon, they could see the forbidden area they were going towards.\u00a0</span><span>A roar emerged from Crockta\u2019s chest, \u201cI, Crockta, am goingggggg! Bul\u2019tarrrr!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta rushed forward as well.\u00a0</span><span>An orc and a gnome started running towards the north.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Hunting was a calm, peaceful task.</span></p><br/><p><span>He moved within the darkness of the forest.\u00a0</span><span>He was the shadow, an entity the enemy couldn\u2019t notice, moving between the trees, aiming to cut off the enemy\u2019s breath.</span></p><br/><p><span>The game that he was staring at was rare.\u00a0</span><span>A twin head ogre.\u00a0</span><span>A mutation like this didn\u2019t just appear. If a legitimate evil spirit polluted an ogre, then it became this ugly monster.</span></p><br/><p><span>Therefore, what he needed to penetrate wasn\u2019t the mutant twin head ogre, but the core of darkness infecting it.\u00a0</span><span>He had aimed for the darkness a long time ago.\u00a0</span><span>It was his old cherished wish, but he had missed the chance.</span></p><br/><p><span>As winter passed and the buds of spring spread across the land, the smell of that darkness started to flare up again. The decaying mutant ogre proved this phenomenon. </span></p><br/><p><span>His mouth distorted.\u00a0</span><span>He had been waiting, and he wouldn\u2019t miss it this time.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now.\u00a0</span><span>It came again.</span></p><br/><p><span>Hunting season.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta touched the gnome\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tiyo?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Going, I\u2019m going, really.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo looked at the black forest and gulped.\u00a0</span><span>There was a thick spread of black trees that was so dense that they could only barely see inside. It felt like they were faintly moving when seen with the naked eye.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, system messages popped up.</span></p><br/><p><span>[You have arrived at the Forest of Creatures.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Wow! You have great courage to come here.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[If you pass through the Forest of Creatures, there will be a reward for arriving first.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[How do you like this quest after not receiving one for a long time?]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Special achievement points will be awarded as you pass through the Forest of Creatures. If you can achieve a hidden clear condition, you will earn tremendous rewards and a title.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Good luck!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta confirmed the message windows. Before, he thought they were just set messages, but these days, it was obvious that an artificial intelligence was controlling the messages. The words were somewhat hateful.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo asked, \"C-Crockta, are we really going? We are going right?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta burst out laughing.\u00a0</span><span>\"Tiyo, are you going to continue like this? Are you really from the Quantes Gnome Garrison?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat! I\u2019m not an indecisive person!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo jumped.\u00a0</span><span>\"Good </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! I\u2019ll show you! Starting from now </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he leaped eagerly towards the forest.\u00a0</span><span>The small gnome couldn\u2019t be seen after he entered the shadows of the dark forest.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was about to walk after him when...</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUwaaaaaaaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo came running back out of the forest and rolling across the ground before getting back up and running again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What\u2019s going on?\" Crockta drew his greatsword and shouted. </span><span>There was a large shadow in the place where Tiyo had run out. It was about to come out of the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was nervous.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The identity of that shadow\u2026 \u00a0was a huge spotted cow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...M-Monster! A monster has appeared </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d Tiyo shouted as he grabbed Crockta\u2019s pants.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta gazed at Tiyo with cold eyes. Tiyo felt a chill as he gazed into Crockta\u2019s eyes and looked away.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Moo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The cow cried out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was just a cow.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo got up from his seat without speaking and rubbed at his clothes, \u201cHum hum, hum! Now, shall we go Crockta? Don\u2019t hesitate</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he started walking again.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta shook his head and followed behind Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo snooped around the cow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBy the way, why is there a cow here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI was thinking that too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta examined the cow. It wasn't just a wild cow. There was evidence that someone was looking after it. It stood still as they approached it and stared at them with simple eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta stroked the head of the cow and it cried out again. It was a calm cry.</span></p><br/><p><em><span>Mooooo....</span></em></p><br/><p><span>It calmed the hearts of the listeners. This place now felt like a leisurely pasture, not a forest full of creatures.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs someone inside?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are there people in this forest?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The Forest of Creatures had long been regarded as a forbidden area that couldn\u2019t be accessed by people. Usually, people would fall prey to creatures as soon as they entered.\u00a0</span><span>But now there were traces of a human\u2019s touch on the cow.\u00a0</span><span>What was this?</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Crockta stared at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Go.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Now it really was the time to enter the Forest of Creatures. \u00a0</span><span>Tiyo climbed onto the cow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, lead us well.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The cow\u2019s tail waved.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta led the cow and Tiyo and entered the Forest of Creatures.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was cold as soon as they entered.</span></p><br/><p><span>The temperature was lowered as the dense foliage covered the sky and blocked the sun, causing everything below it to be in steady shade. The damp ground was trampled underfoo as moss flourished at the base of the trees and unknown sticky things got caught on their feet.</span></p><br/><p><span>It felt like a bad place.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Cow, where is your house?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo whispered to the cow. Then the cow started to walk in a certain direction. Tiyo and Crockta followed the cow as they gradually headed deeper into the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>They had no way of knowing what would appear beyond the darkness. Just like mountains were often described as strange, he felt a creepy sensation as the direction seemed to keep shifting. It was a strange feeling that he had never experienced before.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, they sensed something moving.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Tiyo flinched. Crockta placed his hand on the handle of his greatsword while Tiyo prepared General.</span></p><br/><p><span>The moving object approached.\u00a0</span><span>A troll.\u00a0</span><span>It was a forest where trolls were common.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grinned. This truly was the Forest of Creatures. Monsters like goblins or werewolves wouldn\u2019t be able to stay here.</span></p><br/><p><span>The minimum requirement was a troll!\u00a0</span><span>Weak creatures wouldn\u2019t survive here.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo shouted, \u201cGo! Crockta!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As Crockta rushed out, Tiyo fired \u2018General\u2019.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a formation similar to how they defeated the ogres at Quantes. Tiyo would block the enemy in the back with his magic weapon while Crockta faced it directly.\u00a0</span><span>The troll was hit by General\u2019s intense light and fell to the ground like it was paralyzed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKiek!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo\u2019s General didn\u2019t have the destructive power to kill the enemy, but it was excellent support. The troll groaned at Tiyo\u2019s bombardment. Crockta plunged in.\u00a0</span><span>The famous \u2018Ogre Slayer\u2019 cut the troll\u2019s neck.</span></p><br/><p><span>The troll\u2019s head and body were separated.\u00a0</span><span>But it was a troll. Even after the head and body were separated, both sides wriggled and moved. Bubbles bloomed at the cut surface, indicating the troll\u2019s unique regeneration. If the troll\u2019s head and body joined back together, it could move again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow great.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Creepy </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s recovery skill had reached \u2018Troll's Regenerative Power (Essence)\u2019, but it seemed lacking compared to a real troll.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Tiyo exchanged glances.\u00a0</span><span>It was a truly great collaboration. This Forest of Creatures might not be that tough.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta held out his hand and the gnome hit his palm in a high five.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMoooooo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The cow gave a long cry in delight.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo once again got on the cow\u2019s back with General.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Cow, where do you live?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The cow\u2019s tail waved and it started moving again. It was heading deeper into the forest. Crockta followed it.</span></p><br/><p><span>The cow seemed to be familiar with the Forest of Creatures and they passed by a variety of strange things. If the cow suddenly sniffed the ground, delicious mushrooms would emerge. Once it began to cry towards the sky, there were sweet fruits.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo bit a red fruit. The cow also nibbled at the fragrant mushroom.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It seems very familiar with this place dot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It really seems to live here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As they continued walking with the cow, the shape of a house started to appear.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta lowered his body.\u00a0</span><span>The cow was tame but there was no law saying that the owner of the house would be. Besides, the person was strong enough to live in the Forest of Creatures.</span></p><br/><p><span>The house was surrounded by a moat and a sharp fence. Their bodies would be pierced by a sharp barricade if they approached without thinking.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo said.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA magic circle </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMagic circle?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLooking at the design, they don\u2019t seem to be lacking in intelligence. It looks like this place is protected with magical artifacts. Indeed, this is how they managed to live in the Forest of Creatures.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo analyzed. As a gnome, he easily recognized the magical engineering design. As he listened to Tiyo\u2019s words, a faint presence could be felt in the area.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMoo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The cow moved around the moat and suddenly stopped at one point. It walked through a shallow part of the moat.\u00a0</span><span>After crossing the moat, the cow crouched and passed through a hole in the dirt beneath the fence. It was a small passage. Despite the cow\u2019s big mass, it went through like a mollusk.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then it cried out again from beyond the fence.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMooooo....\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo looked at each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Can we go in?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am curious.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But it is another person\u2019s house.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We can\u2019t ignore the cow. The cow is also a member of that household! In other words, the member of the family invited us </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUm...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He had a point.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo used the shallow part of the moat and passed through the hole like the cow.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo entered easily but Crockta\u2019s skin was scratched by a piece of fence and he barely passed through it.</span></p><br/><p><span>The inside was an entirely different world.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUmm.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a peaceful scenery that couldn\u2019t be imagined inside the Forest of Creatures.\u00a0</span><span>First of all, there were two more cows. The cow that Tiyo and Crockta brought here cried out leisurely.\u00a0</span><span>On one side, chickens were pecking at the ground.\u00a0</span><span>Vegetables were growing in the garden.\u00a0</span><span>In the center, a solid house made of logs was standing firm. There were axes, pickaxes, and farming equipment lying around. It felt like someone had lived here for a long time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"How great.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Crockta found something among the tools.\u00a0</span><span>They were handmade arrows and arrowheads.\u00a0</span><span>Since this was a forest...a hunter.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Look! Crockta! This is definitely the artifact that is protecting this place dot!\u201d Tiyo shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta approached and saw a magic staff next to the log cabin. There was a crystal ball at the end and a blue aura flowed from it and spread out in a circle.\u00a0</span><span>It seemed to create a dim shield that concealed this area.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The magic power runs down here and...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo explained. Below the place where the staff was inserted, there were round shapes and patterns.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is a great technology </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo\u2019s eyes shone. As Tiyo was looking around, he accidentally nudged the staff.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment.</span></p><br/><p><em><span>Piiing!</span></em></p><br/><p><em><span>Piyok!</span></em></p><br/><p><span>There was a sound and the magic staff lost its light.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEh...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo stiffened.\u00a0</span><span>The blue energy flowing from the staff suddenly disappeared. Then faint film covering this area also disappeared.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Ah, no.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The shield protecting this place had disappeared.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo retreated.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked up at the sky.\u00a0</span><span>Wyverns were passing above them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment that the barrier disappeared, a wyvern glanced down. Crockta\u2019s hands became sweaty.\u00a0</span><span>Just keep flying.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, the wyverns started circling around. </span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo stuttered, \"I, I, I, just...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Calm down Tiyo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>One of the biggest rules of the battlefield: don\u2019t dwell on the past.\u00a0</span><span>It already happened, so it was meaningless to argue. They could analyze the operation or fighting techniques after it was over, but they should concentrate on the enemy when it was in front of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>The wyverns started to flap their wings.\u00a0</span><span>It was the precursor to gliding.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked around.\u00a0</span><span>There were two objects of prey that the wyverns could aim for.\u00a0</span><span>Them or the cows.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTiyo, there are two choices.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...What does that mean?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>More wyverns started appearing. The group of wyverns had flocked at the sudden appearance of easy food.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo raised General.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe only have one choice </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkul, well said.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>One Wyvern started to dive towards the cows, followed by three other wyverns.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo aimed the muzzle of \u2018General\u2019.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>His new ally wasn\u2019t just cute.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"As a reliable guard, I never run away from a fight </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was a real man.</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment that the Wyvern's sharp claws were about to grab a cow,\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s roar resounded through the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tarrrrrrrr\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the Essence ranked skill, Army Crushing Roar!\u00a0</span><span>It went beyond a mere battle cry and actually affected the enemies with physical force.</span></p><br/><p><span>The dense vegetation shook.\u00a0</span><span>The wyverns were shocked and stopped their descent. The cows figured out the situation and turned to flee from the wyverns.\u00a0</span><span>The wyverns regained their spirits and tried to catch the cows again, but Crockta blocked them.</span></p><br/><p><span>The greatsword tore at the wyverns\u2019 wings. One wyvern fell to the ground while the ones following scattered to the left and right.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo attacked the wyverns with General.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ahhhhhhh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The wyverns spread out and soared up to the sky again.\u00a0</span><span>The wyverns were fast and avoided the attack. Tiyo\u2019s bullets just hit the air.</span></p><br/><p><span>The confrontation continued with no progress.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s expression hardened.\u00a0</span><span>They couldn\u2019t overpower the wyverns who dominated the sky. But more wyverns would come flocking soon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo bit his lip.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment...</span></p><br/><p><em><span>Susususuk.</span></em></p><br/><p><span>A strange bolt flew through the air.</span></p><br/><p><em><span>Pasasak.</span></em></p><br/><p><span>One wyvern crashed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Tiyo\u2019s eyes shone.</span></p><br/><p><em><span>Susususuk.</span></em></p><br/><p><span>Once again, a bolt of light passed through the sky and another wyvern fell.\u00a0</span><span>The wyverns continued to plummet. Now there were no more wyverns threatening them as they all became corpses. The party couldn\u2019t tell where the attack came from.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at the arrows lodged in the bodies of the wyverns.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta approached to verify it.</span></p><br/><p><span><em>Sususuk</em>, an arrow flew right in front of Crockta\u2019s nose.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then another arrow struck in front of Crockta\u2019s foot, an obvious warning not to move from this spot.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Tiyo looked in the direction that the arrows came from.</span></p><br/><p><span>Someone was walking towards them.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!

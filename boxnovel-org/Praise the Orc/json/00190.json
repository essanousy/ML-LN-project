Crockta\u2019s group followed him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is this the right direction <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don't know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus ran without looking back.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta gauged the direction.\u00a0</span><span>The ogres were traveling straight after the thunderbird, while Zankus was moving in a semicircle.\u00a0</span><span>Looking at Zankus\u2019s trajectory, he had already guessed where the thunderbird\u2019s nest was.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cJust follow Zankus.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, one ogre appeared. It seemed to be a straggler from the group.\u00a0</span><span>Their eyes met as the ogre showed its teeth. \u00a0</span><span>Crockta pulled out God Slayer. The ogre\u2019s head \u00a0suddenly exploded as an arrow had passed over Crockta\u2019s head and penetrated the ogre\u2019s skull.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus. Zankus, who was in the lead, turned and shot an arrow with the huge bow.\u00a0</span><span>The arrow was also big and looked like a spear.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo stopped and looked around after the arrow hit. For Tiyo, it was really oversized.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCoarse arrow <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The arrow turned round and round.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am also skilled in spear techniques!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus smiled and turned around. Crockta\u2019s group watched him before following again.\u00a0</span><span>They continued through the great forest.\u00a0</span><span>Then a mountain rose in the distance. It was a steep slope, as if someone had artificially created it.\u00a0</span><span>Ogres were climbing the bottom of this mountain</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus loaded an arrow and watched the movements of the thunderbird.\u00a0</span><span>He seemed to be thinking about something.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They are approaching.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogres climbed the mountain like ants. It was an amazing sight.\u00a0</span><span>Just a few ogres could cause a disaster in a city, but dozens of ogres had gathered to catch the thunderbird.\u00a0</span><span>A few cities would be destroyed if this group was released onto the continent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThunderbird.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The thunderbird felt the crisis and flew warily around its nest. Gusts of wind blew when it flapped its wings, causing a few ogres to topple over.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuwaaaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The angry ogre wizard roared.\u00a0</span><span>The thunderbird hurriedly flew higher but was hit by an unknown force. The thunderbird staggered as its feathers scattered every which way.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They are nearing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus and Crockta\u2019s group approached the mountain while watching the battle.\u00a0</span><span>Suddenly, one ogre climbed to a flat area. The moment it was going to put its feet on the flat ground...</span></p><br/><p><span>The thunderbird attacked the ogre. The ogre wielded a club. The huge bird and ogre tangled together.\u00a0</span><span>The thunderbird\u2019s claws shredded the ogre\u2019s body. However, the bloody ogre resisted until the end.\u00a0</span><span>The ogre wizard\u2019s magic tied up the thunderbird once again, allowing the ogre\u2019s club to hit it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe thunderbird is in danger <em>dot</em>!\u201d Tiyo shouted while watching.\u00a0</span><span>Meanwhile, other ogres were on their way. Another ogre grabbed the tail feathers of the thunderbird. The thunderbird struggled wildly. The ogres fell down again.</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogres persistently clung to the thunderbird. Like a swarm of ants, the ogres climbed onto the thunderbird\u2019s body. The ogres used their nails and teeth to harass the thunderbird.\u00a0</span><span>The ogres kept attacking.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t know why it is fighting the ogres...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Thunderbirds were legendary because of their huge size, beautiful appearance and great speed, not for their strength in fighting.\u00a0</span><span>The thunderbird that he knew would\u2019ve flown around snatching the one at a time, instead of tangling together like this.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ll try to drop some.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus aimed his arrow. His arm muscles swelled up. The giant spear was pulled back to the fullest.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus\u2019 archery was different from Shakan\u2019s.\u00a0</span><span>He was like a cannon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Bul\u2019tarrrr!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus pulled the bowstring back all the way and let go.\u00a0</span><span>The arrow burst out with a roar. It just the mountain just below where the thunderbird was struggling.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kuaaaaaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The whole mountain shook like there was an earthquake. The ogres barely clinging to the mountain fell at once.\u00a0</span><span>The rear collapsed and the bodies of the ogres poured down in layers. The ogres on the bottom were crushed and died.\u00a0</span><span>Most of the ogres approaching the thunderbird were washed away.</span></p><br/><p><span>The thunderbird didn\u2019t miss this opportunity and moved. The ogres clinging to it fell off. Once its wings were free, the thunderbird grabbed two ogres and flew into the sky.\u00a0</span><span>It rose to a high altitude and dropped the two ogres.\u00a0</span><span>The ogres crashed. Their bodies couldn\u2019t withstand the shock of the fall and smashed to pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span>The terrible shriek of the thunderbird echoed through the great forest. But the ogres didn\u2019t give up and climbed the mountain again.\u00a0</span><span>The ogre wizard was screaming in anger while constantly sending magic towards the thunderbird.\u00a0</span><span>As lightning flashed, the thunderbird moved its wings and avoided the attacks. The two of them stared at each other and moved.</span></p><br/><p><span>Despite the ogres\u2019 persistent attack, the thunderbird flew around its nest without escaping.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus watched it and said, \"We must approach first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he rushed quickly without listening to Crockta\u2019s reply, who followed with Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUhhhh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, Anor didn\u2019t have the strength to move anymore.\u00a0</span><span>The exhausted Anor stopped and caught his breath. He bowed his head and panted for a while.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cExcuse me...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But the group had already gone too far.\u00a0</span><span>Anor became despondent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMore than this...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor used his magic power as the power of a necromancer unfolded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, this is?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He stopped when he found what he was looking for. He put his hands together and concentrated his strength.\u00a0</span><span>The earth was disturbed and a bony wing popped out.\u00a0</span><span>Anor used the power of a necromancer to revive an animal that died not long ago, in order to ride it.</span></p><br/><p><span>The shape was soon revealed.\u00a0</span><span>The owner of the wings that let out an eerie cry!</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Chirppppp....chirpppp....\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>An undead sparrow. The sparrow flew and sat on Anor\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Chirpppppppp....\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor dropped his arms.\u00a0</span><span>The cry was eerier, but it was a cute bone sparrow.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh, I don't know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor just sat down.\u00a0</span><span>The sparrow kept on chirping on Anor\u2019s head.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus approached the rear of the thunderbird\u2019s nest. Some of the ogres exploded because of his arrow.\u00a0</span><span>His bow was destructive.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus retried the arrows and carried them on his back again. Rather than an archer carrying arrows, he looked like a warrior with multiple spears.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Go this way.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The thunderbird was distracted by the ogres and wasn\u2019t paying attention to this side.\u00a0</span><span>\"I will go up my own way. If you are confident, you can imitate me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus threw his huge arrow and stuck it in the rock wall.\u00a0</span><span>Then he jumped up. The arrow bent and he used the recoil to fly up into the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOuh!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He used the tremendous jump and quickly reached a high place. He placed his hand in a rough niche and grabbed on.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Amazing.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He climbed up the cliff wall like a spider. He measured his position and where he wanted to go, then immediately jumped up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOkay, me too!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo jumped on top of the arrow after Zankus. Tiyo bent down and jumped upwards.\u00a0</span><span>His body was light, so he could fly much higher than Zankus. His body was small but he climbed quickly.\u00a0</span><span>It was a curious sight.\u00a0</span><span>The figures of Zankus and Tiyo became smaller.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Now it is my turn.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta wiped his nose and jumped on the arrow.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kwajijik!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>But due to the shock that piled up, the part of the rock that the arrow was stabbed in fell down. Crockta also fell.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCough!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His body hit the ground and clouds of dust flew into the air.\u00a0</span><span>After a while, the dirt covered Crockta rose.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kyahahahahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo\u2019s mocking laugh rang out from above.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKulkul, kulkulkulkul.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta laughed and said,\u00a0</span><span>\"I'm angry.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta glared at the rock.\u00a0</span><span>The angry Crockta didn\u2019t use any tricks.\u00a0</span><span>He faced the opponent head on.\u00a0</span><span>He stuck to the wall like a cicada. Then he started to climb up using his hands and legs. The angry Crockta\u2019s grip was tight as he found corners to support him.\u00a0</span><span>It was an unstoppable climb, like there was something sticky on his hands.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus and Tiyo felt an unknown crisis as Crockta climbed the rock like crazy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ohhhhhh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Slow down, s-scary <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ohhhhhh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The rock is shaking <em>dot</em>!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Zankus moved faster as they felt like a monster was chasing them from behind.\u00a0</span><span>They soon reached the slope.\u00a0</span><span>The torn flesh of the ogres was scattered all over the place.\u00a0</span><span>If they kept climbing up, they would reach the thunderbird\u2019s nest. However, the field of view was so clear that they couldn\u2019t avoid being seen by the thunderbird.</span></p><br/><p><span>The thunderbird already noticed their presence, but it only glanced at Zankus and Tiyo while facing the ogres.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Weren\u2019t you going to hunt it? It looks okay now.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stepped on the slope and asked.\u00a0</span><span>It was the perfect timing. The thunderbird wasn\u2019t paying attention to Zankus because it was fighting the ogres. If he aimed for a gap, the thunderbird wouldn\u2019t be able to avoid it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ll put it off for the moment.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zankus looked up. He was looking at the thunderbird\u2019s nest on top of the steep mountain.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThere is something I want to check.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Zankus once again loaded his arrow.\u00a0</span><span>If Crockta\u2019s God Slayer was a greatsword, his bow was a ballista.\u00a0</span><span>He fired the arrow.\u00a0</span><span>The goal wasn\u2019t the thunderbird.\u00a0</span><span>Ogre wizard.\u00a0</span><span>The huge arrow hit the ogre wizard\u2019s shoulder.\u00a0</span><span>In the aftermath, the ogre wizard collapsed to the ground. Blood flowed from the wounded area. The ogre wizard roared angrily.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuwaaaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogre wizard became crazy and started to attack the thunderbird with all its power. The ogre wizard wanted to kill everyone on this mountain.\u00a0</span><span>It aimed a spell towards the thunderbird. The thunderbird rose and then plummeted towards the ogre wizard.</span></p><br/><p><span>The ogres clung to the thunderbird. The ogre wizard\u2019s magic power burned the target, not distinguishing between ogres and the thunderbird.\u00a0</span><span>The ogres were torn apart by the thunderbird\u2019s claws and wings. Blood splashed and lightning flashed.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a melee.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let's go up.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus distracted the thunderbird and started climbing again.\u00a0</span><span>His speed increased.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The summit of the mountain.\u00a0</span><span>They reached the place where the thunderbird\u2019s nest was located.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHere <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo pointed to a cave.

Kulkulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>What cute people.\u00a0</span><span>They had accidentally captured him, and yet they were confident that they could execute him?\u00a0</span><span>Their actions were too hasty.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEdgar. Do you only have this much?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta remembered drinking with Edgar, the one who imprisoned him.\u00a0</span><span>Edgar might\u2019ve forgotten it, but Crockta remembered the stories that were shared.\u00a0</span><span>He was a decent man.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta appreciated the fact that he noticed Crockta\u2019s identity and quickly imprisoned him, as well as Edgar\u2019s cold and rational behavior in front of his men.</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar did what he had to do.\u00a0</span><span>Their positions were different. As the leader of a group, he was a man who knew exactly what he had to do.\u00a0</span><span>Kill the symbol of the enemy. The more that morale fell, the less the enemies would be able to fight back.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, the opponent was Crockta. Edgar was too impatient.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You said that a leader should be a castle,\u201d Crockta muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar had drunkenly told Crockta, </span></p><br/><p><span>'I\u2019m the leader. The leader, a castle. Who would want a castle who shakes when the wind blows? I must be an unshakable castle. Cool and hard. Sometimes it is hard, but it is part of being a man. Brother!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Who was Crockta to judge a man acting like a solid castle?</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well, put in front of a bit person like me, he will just get hurt.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded.\u00a0</span><span>It was unfortunate.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta had decided on war on the Heaven and Earth clan. Therefore, if they wanted to execute him, Crockta would come to them directly.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta approached a user on the street.\u00a0</span><span>He had hidden himself as soon as Crockta appeared and kept looking at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>He was one of the clan members who had been standing next to Edgar.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>He thought that he had hidden himself well, but Crockta easily found him.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta grinned in a relaxed manner. The other person turned pale.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Did you think you would stop me with steel bars?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Tell this to Edgar. I never run away.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta touched the handle of Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou guys have nominated the place so let\u2019s play properly. If you win, it will be a wonderful execution like you planned.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you are scared then you can back out. The Heaven and Earth clan is only this much. Kulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The user stared blankly at the laughing Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>They were eyes filled with faith.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHey, Orc. You have no clue about the Heaven and Earth Clan. Okay, then I\u2019ll see you later. Let\u2019s see how your smug face becomes distorted.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hoh. That seems good.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta also laughed and then raised a fist as he hitthe user\u2019s forehead.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAack!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>It was very painful because his knuckles were solid.\u00a0</span><span>The user grabbed his forehead with a yelp.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you have any complaints?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don't be cocky.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The chance was good, but the user was annoying, so Crockta had used violence.\u00a0</span><span>This was Elder Lord, a world where the fist was similar to the\u00a0</span>law.\u00a0<span>The user shook because he didn\u2019t dare go against Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou, I\u2019ll see you later!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He snapped at Crockta and ran away. Crockta gazed after him and laughed.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The plains outside Maillard.\u00a0</span><span>There was a group of humans.\u00a0</span><span>The lead warrior was Edgar. As he waved the flag of the Heaven and Earth Clan, the users following him shouted.\u00a0</span><span>It was a sign of fear to anyone playing Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>This flag had flown on devastated battlefields. The name \u2018Heaven and Earth\u2019, the strongest clan in Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo matter how skilled or powerful Crockta is, he can\u2019t deal with all of us.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Someone next to Edgar said. Edgar nodded. His expression was still cool and sober.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The hastily collected mercenaries can disturb our rhythm.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Not all of them were the Heaven and Earth members, as he gathered people to participate in the battle using money.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Nevertheless, there is still a lot of room.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Deal with Crockta. And...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He looked around.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t feel anyone approaching.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThese rehabilitation people who will come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They announced that they would publicly execute Crockta. It was to stimulate the Rehabilitation Brothers.\u00a0</span><span>The Rehabilitation Brothers, whose power started in Maillard, weren\u2019t large in number. However, they stuck together and obstructed the Heaven and Earth Clan.\u00a0</span><span>The mission of the Heaven and Earth branch in Mallard was to mainly keep them in check.</span></p><br/><p><span>This time, if possible, he would put an end to them as well as Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>For the sake of today, Edgar had harshly trained his clan members and helped them level up.\u00a0</span><span>The Heaven and Earth\u2019s leadership trusted him and appointed him in charge of Maillard, so he would do what was necessary to get results.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe isn\u2019t coming.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt seems like it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Time passed by Crockta didn\u2019t show. The sun was slowly moving above their head. The clan members started murmuring.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Everyone, don\u2019t be shaken.\"\u00a0</span><span>Edgar calmed everyone.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is he imitating Miyamoto Musashi?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...Crockta doesn\u2019t know Musashi, but he is a warrior who has gone through many battles. He might instinctively be aiming for a similar effect.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Japan's swordsman Miyamoto Musashi deliberately arrived late for his duel with Sasaki Kojiro, messing with Kojiro\u2019s composure. This allowed Musashi to gain a psychological advantage in the ensuing duel.\u00a0</span><span>It was uncertain if this story was true, but based on the situation with Crockta, it seemed to be effective.</span></p><br/><p><span>Some members were nervous and others were too excited.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWill he really come?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar was silent.\u00a0</span><span>He had a point.\u00a0</span><span>Edgar might be deceived by the title of Righteous Orc, the honorable warrior. If he lured them here and went elsewhere...</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar looked up at the sky again and saw that the sun was started to descend. The appointed time had already passed.\u00a0</span><span>His back started tingling. Right now, he had gathered all of the clan members. In other words, there was a minimum number of people at their facilities in Maillard.</span></p><br/><p><span>The number was too small to fight against Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>It would be a big loss if those facilities were destroyed.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta had escaped from the prison by luring Lee Jungmin. He wasn\u2019t merely a strong warrior. He was a fighter who didn\u2019t hesitate to use sneaky plots.</span></p><br/><p><span>He was known as a righteous orc, but inside he was more cunning.</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar snapped at his members.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cLeave...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, he couldn\u2019t say anything else.\u00a0</span><span>There was a group coming from far away.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Ching.</span></i><i><span>Ching.</span></i><i><span>Ching.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>It was the sound of steel armor. Edgar sighed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They have come.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were waving a flag with the letters \u2018Rehabilitation\u2019 on it!\u00a0</span><span>There was no one in Maillard who didn\u2019t know the \u2018Rehabilitation\u2019 flag. The members of Rehabilitation Brothers.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is a joke when I look at it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Unlike the Heaven and Earth\u2019s uniform, the Rehabilitation Brothers members were all dressed freely.\u00a0</span><span>The Heaven and Earth gazed at them fiercely, and the Rehabilitation Brothers responded with bloody gazes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"All this tension.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The members of the Rehabilitation Brothers stood before them.\u00a0</span><span>Since they were non-clan users, their equipment and combat power was less than the Heaven and Earth Clan.\u00a0</span><span>But they were armed with a strong will and never retreated in the face of the Heaven and Earth Clan.</span></p><br/><p><span>The one who led the Maillard branch of the Rehabilitation Brothers was the hunter class \u2018Robina\u2019, who was rumored to be a national representative in archery.\u00a0</span><span>She came forward and spoke to Edgar.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is it hard to see my face?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Robina grinned.</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar didn\u2019t smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Where is Crockta? I heard there was an orc wandering around and that he is called Crockta. You do have him right?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>She looked around.\u00a0</span><span>\"Where is he?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNot here.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you talking about?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He escaped.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>She narrowed her eyes, but once Edgar\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, she burst out laughing.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHahahahat, I knew it. How would you be able to catch Crockta?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow dull.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>She shrugged.\u00a0</span><span>\"Then and now, you are always disappointing me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar's face twitched.\u00a0</span><span>He closed his eyes so that his face wouldn\u2019t twist.\u00a0</span><span>He settled his emotions and thought about a cool lake to sink his head into. An unshakable and serene water surface with no ripples.\u00a0</span><span>His emotions faded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cRobina. They don\u2019t have Crockta so can\u2019t we fight? Just looking at the traitor\u2019s face makes my stomach hurt,\u201d said the man standing next to Robina.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, the Heaven and Earth members simultaneously raised their weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Shut up. If you talk to Edgar like that, we will kill you without mercy.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ll kill him right away and stop his stomach from hurting.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Edgar, let\u2019s kill them.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar opened his eyes. </span></p><br/><p><span>Robina\u2019s face was clear.\u00a0</span><span>At one time, they were together.\u00a0</span><span>Edgar was once a member of Rehabilitation Brothers.</span></p><br/><p><span>He said, \"I wanted to get rid of you along with Crockta anyway.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs that so?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is the last offer. Take everything you own and leave Maillard.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a proposal that couldn\u2019t be accepted.</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar\u2019s Heaven and Earth members were ready to fight as their blades shone under the sun.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you really have to do this?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Robina said while stepping back.\u00a0</span><span>Her fingers moved to her quiver. Her strong point was her continuous fire. An arrow would leave the bow as soon as there was the slightest movement.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI never thought you were a man like this. Ah, there is a lot of disappointment.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>She said with a smile</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Disappointment...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Edgar repeated her words and then began to laugh.\u00a0</span><span>However, his lungs and diaphragm were cramping and he didn\u2019t know if it was really laughter. He just smiled as emotions clashed inside him.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, how can we understand others?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Edgar pulled out his sword.\u00a0</span><span>The momentum of the clan members was pushing at his back.\u00a0</span><span>It was the feeling of being uplifted. But he couldn\u2019t get too excited. \u00a0The fact that there were trustworthy allies calmed him down.</span></p><br/><p><span>He looked at the Rehabilitation Brothers. At one time, he was with them.\u00a0</span><span>Now they were Edgar\u2019s enemies.\u00a0</span><span>He turned towards Robina in the front.\u00a0</span><span>She was still beautiful.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Heaven and Earth!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At one time, they had been lovers.\u00a0</span><span>She was a special existence to him.\u00a0</span><span>Once he fell into hell, he was so caught up in his own problems that he couldn\u2019t look around and she left him.\u00a0</span><span>After losing the special figure in his life, he felt like he had lost the whole world.</span></p><br/><p><span>But now it was different.\u00a0</span><span>He was more special than her.\u00a0</span><span>He would climb to the top. He would climb until she could no longer be seen.\u00a0</span><span>So he didn\u2019t feel regret anymore.\u00a0</span><span>He was just a little sad.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"War!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In the future, his exciting adventure would continue to unfold and she couldn\u2019t accompany him.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHah, so those two were dating each other</span><i><span> dot</span></i><span>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It isn\u2019t obvious based on their conversation, but he confessed all sorts of things to me while drunk. Kulkulkul! Things like \u2018I love her more than life.\u2019 Aigoo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It sounds like a play. Their relationship, that is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was chewing on fried corn with Tiyo and Anor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Who will win?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I guess the Heaven and Earth Clan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Rehabilitation </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! The rehabilitation group will win! Look at the strong eyes of that girl </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>! It is like frost covering the sea </span><i><span>dot</span></i><span>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They hid behind a rock and watched the battle between the Heaven and Earth Clan and the Rehabilitation Brothers.\u00a0</span><span>The two groups failed to notice as the fierce fight began. In its own way, it was a battle between two clans in Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>But it seemed dull compared to the great battles they fought in the north.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t like the small number of people </span><i><span>dot.</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The scale was much smaller than the desperate battle between the dark elves and orcs of the Great Clan.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Don't say that. War isn\u2019t a game.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor started arguing with Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI-I\u2019m just saying <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Just saying what?

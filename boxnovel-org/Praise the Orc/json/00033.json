The TV stopped at one channel.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>-Hello. I am Giuseppe, a reporter from [Surprise! What happened in Elder Lord?].</span></i><i><span>I am now in the elven city, Arnin.</span></i><i><span>There is a strange thing occurring here!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Behind her were the high walls of Arnin. The camera illuminated Arnin\u2019s landscape before focusing on Giuseppe again.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Arnin is famous for its beautiful elf mayor, but there is something more mysterious than her beauty occurring here.</span></i><i><span>It isn\u2019t here in Arnin, but in the Northern Arnin Plains, the place where triters are hunted to build up reputation.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>She ran northwards towards the plains. The angle shook like the cameraman was chasing after her.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>What is going on here?</span></i><i><span>This Giuseppe will go and check it out!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>She discovered users walking out of the plains. Their faces were covered in mosaics.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>-Hello.</span></i><i><span>Did you just come from the Arnin Plains? </span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>So what?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>People are saying that a miracle is happening at Arnin Plains, is that true?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Ahh...</span></i></p><br/><p><span>A dwarf male nodded.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>-That\u2019s right.</span></i><i><span>It is a very curious thing.</span></i><i><span>I was pleasantly surprised.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>What is it?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>You will know if you go there.</span></i><i><span>If you go now, then you will be able to meet him.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Subtitles appeared and there was a narrator.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>-Who can she meet?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>This time, Giuseppe asked the elf standing beside the dwarf. His face was also covered in a mosaic.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Have you met him personally?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Of course.</span></i><i><span>We drank and ate together all night.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Drank?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>That\u2019s right.</span></i><i><span>At first there was a misunderstanding, but he is a very kind and nice person.</span></i><i><span>My eyes were opened.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Wow, is he really that great?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>He is truly...a true </span></i><span>\u25cb\u25cb.</span></p><br/><p><span>The last part referring to the character was beeped out.\u00a0</span><span>The camera cut to another scene. Giuseppe stood at the entrance of the plains as she stared into the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Now, shall I go and see the rumored person?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Then Giuseppe entered the plains.\u00a0</span><span>The spacious plains were filled with people struggling against the huge triters. Giuseppe lowered her voice and said,</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Now...let\u2019s find out who the rumoured figure is.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Then she ran. She ran across the plains and found a user who had just killed a triter. Giuseppe moved cautiously.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Here...</span></i><i><span>Hello?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Eh, what?</span></i><i><span>Ah, Giuseppe!</span></i><i><span>Aren\u2019t you Giuseppe?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Haha, do you recognize me?</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>-I\u2019m a fan.</span></i><i><span>A big fan of \u2018What happened in Elder Lord?\u2019.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Thank you.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>But what are you doing...</span></i><i><span>Ah!</span></i><i><span>You came because of him.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The user nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Ah!</span></i><i><span>Do you know who he is?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Yes. </span></i><i><span>I know very well.</span></i><i><span>I thanked him for his help a few times.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Thanked him for his help?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Anyone who doesn\u2019t know him here is a spy, a spy.</span></i><i><span>One spy was frightened off by him.</span></i><i><span>Hahaha.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Giuseppe looked at the screen with a coy look.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Then...what type of person is he?</span></i><i><span>I\u2019m really curious.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>She asked the user again.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Where can I meet him?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Hrmm...</span></i><i><span>He...because he is so busy...</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The user stroked his chin and pointed in one direction.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Do you see that rock over there?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>That big rock?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Yes.</span></i><i><span>Wait over there.</span></i><i><span>It is the place where his legend began.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Legend?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Giuseppe trembled and made a big fuss.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Legend!</span></i><i><span>Truly?</span></i><i><span>What legend?</span></i><i><span>And he might be waiting for us!</span></i><i><span>My heart's already pounding!</span></i><i><span>I\u2019m looking forward to it.</span></i><i><span>Would the viewers like to come along as well?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Then she bowed to the user and ran towards the rock.\u00a0</span><span>It was an automatic shot that didn\u2019t require a heavy camera, but the screen waved once again like someone was chasing after her.</span></p><br/><p><span>They arrived in front of the rock. It was a big rock. But as they approached it, they saw something engraved in the rock.\u00a0</span><span>Subtitles popped up.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Do you want to know what is written on here...?]</span></p><br/><p><span>Giuseppe breathed out and placed her hands on the rock and took a step back in amazement.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>There is something engraved here.</span></i><i><span>This...?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, the focus blurred. The letters engraved on the rock couldn\u2019t be seen. Subtitles popped up.</span></p><br/><p><span>[It will continue in a moment!]</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the screen switched to some ads.\u00a0</span><span>The customers watching idly in the restaurant started to complain as the advertisements appeared.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Isn\u2019t dragging it on like this annoying?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That\u2019s right. That reporter, I don\u2019t like her pretending to be so pretty either.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But what is it about? I\u2019ve never been there before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I have. I feel like puking every time I see a triter now. It was a few days of hard work. I even died once.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Idiot. You died to those cows?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"They aren\u2019t cows. You would turn out the same if you made a mistake.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The customers in the restaurants started to tell their own stories about Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>For some time, the latest capsule and electronic devices from the Myeongsong Group were advertised on the TV. The advertising model was a prominent ranker in Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>After the ads were over, Giuseppe appeared on the screen again. The eyes of the customers turned back to the television again.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Carved here...what is it...?</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>It is coarse writing, like it was made with a blade!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The screen was close up so the full sentence didn\u2019t appear at first. Giuseppe touched each of the letters by hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Warrior...</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The screen got further away and the sentence on the rock appeared.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>-A warrior doesn\u2019t...attack unarmed people?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Giuseppe was confused.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Who carved this?</span></i><i><span>Warrior?</span></i><i><span>Somehow, I can feel the spirit of chivalry.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>It was at that moment.\u00a0</span><span>Giuseppe suddenly turned her head. Her face turned pale.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Uhh...?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The screen convulsed. There was a loud sound, like something had bumped into the camera.\u00a0</span><span>A triter.\u00a0</span><span>Giuseppe wasn\u2019t a strong user so she ran away. The person recording her also ran. The screen kept on shaking.</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment that the triter was about to reach Giuseppe.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Kyaaaaah!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The screen was overturned.\u00a0</span><span>The blue sky of Elder Lord appeared on the screen.\u00a0</span><span>The silence continued.</span></p><br/><p><span>The customers watching the video were confused.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...Isn\u2019t this a broadcasting accident?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"But that isn\u2019t a live broadcast.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is she dead? Why would they broadcast a death? To show that it\u2019s real?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The customers in the restaurant murmured.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, something appeared on the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a big hand.\u00a0</span><span>Thick fingers were seen first. The customers thought it was a dwarf, but the skin was green.\u00a0</span><span>The rough hands filled with calluses filled the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Heook...</span></i></p><br/><p><span>A groan emerged from Giuseppe.\u00a0</span><span>The thick hand grabbed what was assumed to be the video recorder\u2019s hand. Her body was pulled up and the screen shook again. </span><span>The sight revealed before them was an orc.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOrc...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc had an unusual appearance.\u00a0</span><span>First, the black bandana on his head. It was old and faded, like it had been used for a long time. The mark of the Blacksmith Company was engraved on the corner.</span></p><br/><p><span>Below it was the face of an orc. Intense eyes that glared at them! A big nose, thick lips, and protruding tusks.\u00a0</span><span>Fierce tattoos spanned his entire body and there was a huge greatsword on his back.\u00a0</span><span>But the most unusual thing was the orc\u2019s outfit.\u00a0</span><span>There was a red cloth vest over leather armor. In the middle of the vest, a clear cross was drawn with a word embroidered underneath it.</span></p><br/><p><span>[R.E.S.C.U.E!]</span></p><br/><p><span>What did \u2018rescue\u2019 mean?\u00a0</span><span>Giuseppe couldn\u2019t speak and just looked at the orc. The orc looked at her and the person shooting.\u00a0</span><span>Then the orc raised a hand.</span></p><br/><p><span>.....!</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc raised his thumb and turned around.\u00a0</span>The back also contained a white cross with words underneath it.</p><br/><p><span>[L.I.F.E.G.U.A.R.D!] </span></p><br/><p><span>The orc disappeared into the triter hunting grounds.\u00a0</span><span>What did they just see?</span></p><br/><p><span>Rescue, lifeguard.\u00a0</span><span>It was like the deep valley rivers, the beach at summer, and the snow-covered ski slopes.</span></p><br/><p><span>Giuseppe muttered blankly.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>J-Just now, an orc saved us.</span></i><i><span>What is this?</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The odd situation where an orc that was treated as a monster saved them!\u00a0</span><span>But this wasn\u2019t the end.</span></p><br/><p><span>A user hunting a triter appeared on the screen. The user flew through the air. The moment that the triter was about to trample on the user, the triter suddenly bounced away, like it was hit by a strong impact.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then a black figure jumped towards it. The triter that had just been trying to stand up fell back down as blood emerged.\u00a0</span><span>It was a perfect hunt.</span></p><br/><p><span>The mysterious orc, who saved them previously, was standing in front of the triter with the giant sword.\u00a0</span><span>The sight of him holding the greatsword in the middle of the broken triter was magnificent.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then the orc raised his thumb towards the user.</span></p><br/><p><span>.....!</span></p><br/><p><span>It was the coolest thumbs up that they had ever seen.\u00a0</span><span>The user bowed and also did a thumbs up. The orc turned around like nothing had happened and sat down on the ground. He watched the people hunting.</span></p><br/><p><span>Giuseppe hurriedly approached the user who had just been saved.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>-Hello User!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Uh...?</span></i><i><span>Ah, hello?</span></i></p><br/><p><i><span>-I am Giuseppe, a reporter from [Surprise!

Although it was sloppy, he somewhat resembled the orc.\u00a0</span><span>As soon as he was about to enter a castle, an elf actor appeared and stood in front of him.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>You can\u2019t access.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Is it because I am an orc?\u2019 The orc asked through gestures.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>An orc isn\u2019t allowed to enter here!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>-.......!</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc made a despairing pose.\u00a0</span><span>The narrator explained.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>He was shocked to hear that he couldn\u2019t enter because he was an orc.</span></i><i><span>However, he found out that there was another way to enter Arnin...</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The orc actor formed a fist and nodded. He headed to the Arnin Plains with a hopeful expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>It is nothing other than hunting monsters on the Arnin Plains.</span></i><i><span>But what he saw was many people suffering while hunting the monsters.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The orc actor looked sad.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>He couldn\u2019t speak, but he was still a tough orc warrior.</span></i><i><span>He made a decision...</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The orc actor decided something with a firm expression.

All the humans called for the orc to kill his opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kill! Kill! Kill!</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>But after all that, he made a difficult decision.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The orc shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>The other actors were shocked by his decision. \u2018Why?\u2019 They protested. The orc looked distressed as he wasn\u2019t able to speak.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Instead of answering with words, the orc inscribed his will on the rock with his sword.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The orc actor aimed the knife at a rock.\u00a0</span><span>Then the screen changed and illuminated the giant rock that actually existed on the Arnin Plains.</span></p><br/><p><span>[A warrior doesn\u2019t attack unarmed people.]</span></p><br/><p><i><span>-It was this.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>For a moment, it shone. \u2018Ohhh\u2019. The sound of an audience cheering was produced as an audio effect.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>This is all true.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>It changed to an interview screen.

What happened in Elder Lord?] production team couldn\u2019t get an interview with him. </span><span>Giuseppe was forced to finish the program in front of the rock carved by the orc.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Unfortunately, I was unable to interview him.</span></i><i><span>It is a shame, but the sentence that he left behind tells us who he is on its own.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The sentence shone again on the screen.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018A warrior doesn\u2019t attack unarmed people.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Many things were implied with the sentence.</span></p><br/><p><span>-</span><i><span>Although he is a NPC, it seems that we have a lot to learn from him.</span></i><i><span>Especially at this time, when many ethical problems are being raised about Elder Lord.</span></i><i><span>I hope you have enjoyed this wonderful, delightful and warm Elder Lord life.</span></i><i><span>This was Giuseppe, a reporter from [Surprise!

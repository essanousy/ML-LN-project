Did you just wake up <em>dot</em>?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta is a sleepyhead.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They had created a griddle and were cooking an unidentified meat on the campfire while laughing.\u00a0</span><span>The sun was bright.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They were supposed to march along the path of the Great Clan once morning came, but morning had already arrived a long time ago.\u00a0</span><span>Caska walked forward with a smile.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy are you looking like that? I was being considerate towards you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDid you delay it on purpose?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe Great Clan...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The great chieftain is wounded. He won\u2019t overdo it for a day or two so you can relax.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>She deliberately delayed the march for Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe faster we are, the better.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He looked around. The dark elves were sitting around and enjoying their meals.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s face stiffened.\u00a0</span><span>\"Caska.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhy? Are you impressed?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta realized as he saw her smile.\u00a0</span><span>They didn\u2019t know war.\u00a0</span><span>They experienced combat, but never war.\u00a0</span><span>They didn\u2019t know how important half a day really was. They didn\u2019t know that one hour could determine defeat or victory in a war.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a bit hard and their bodies might be tired, but they had never experienced the result of delaying the schedule for a while.\u00a0</span><span>A knife was sufficient to kill a person. War was the process of sweeping p people with huge weapons.\u00a0</span><span>The wielded blade would never wait for them.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Have you detected the Great Clan\u2019s movements?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe scouts will be coming back soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You have failed to grasp it yet. We have to start.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Caska sighed, \"We aren\u2019t the only troops. Even without us, there is a force in every city and the cities are working closely together. Try not to do it alone.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Her words weren\u2019t wrong.\u00a0</span><span>But even so, Crockta\u2019s instincts were telling him that they should move now.</span></p><br/><p><span>Last night, he had seen the great chieftain\u2019s red eyes.\u00a0</span><span>There was no compromise or mercy in them. He didn\u2019t even see justification or ambition. There was just a strong desire to fight, blood lust and extreme aggression.\u00a0</span><span>Common sense shouldn\u2019t be applied to him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta spoke again.\u00a0</span><span>\"We have to start as soon as possible.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Caska nodded at Crockta\u2019s determined gaze.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Okay, okay. But you should eat first.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Despite her bad mood, she turned Crockta around and prompted him.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta felt hungry after hearing Caska\u2019s words. He should eat something as she said, then hopefully it wouldn\u2019t be too late when they started moving.</span></p><br/><p><span>The anxiety that he felt might just be his overestimation of Calmahart.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Behind the tent, Tiyo and Anor were giggling while cooking the meat. Crockta walked up to them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo went alert.\u00a0</span><span>\"Those eyes seem like they desire meat <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor chimed in, \"If you don\u2019t work then you don\u2019t get to eat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I won\u2019t give it to the slacker who slept until noon <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo shook some plants.\u00a0</span><span>\"Well, how about this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Tiyo grabbed his body and laughed, Anor laughing along with him. The two of them were well suited for each other.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo said with a smiling face, \"It is a joke dot, a joke. Now, take this. We can\u2019t be inhospitable to Crockta <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he picked up a small piece of meat. It was so small that it didn\u2019t need to be bitten. Tiyo smiled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, diet <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he glanced at Anor and they started giggling again.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhahahat. How funny! Crockta on a diet\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019m just worried about the health of my companion <em>dot</em>! Kahahahahat!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was like the main character of a movie being annoyed by Extras 1 and 2.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked at Tiyo and Anor in turn.\u00a0</span><span>They were still giggling as they made skewers from branches and barely managed to turn the meat.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kilkil, ah hot! The branch is short <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBe careful. We are running out of twigs.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There is meat but no tool...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo laughed again, \"Well, there is a poor man over there who doesn\u2019t even have meat <em>dot</em>... Huhuhu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That isn\u2019t a good attitude when trying to comfort someone. Hihit.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then why are you laughing <em>dot</em>? Kuk...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat about Tiyo? Huhut...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The weather is so good that I\u2019m laughing <em>dot</em>! Kuhihihihit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I am just laughing because of the wind. Hihihihit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta closed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>How sad was this?\u00a0</span><span>The young man Anor followed them because he trusted the warrior Crockta, only to be tainted by an opportunist called Tiyo.\u00a0</span><span>The recently odd man out, who only knew how to swear, was now trying to bully him!</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword, its long shadow covering their heads.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo and Anor flinched.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cD-Don\u2019t tell me...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hey, we were just teasing a bit...haha...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s eyes were sharp like needles.\u00a0</span><span>He shouted and swung the greatsword without hesitation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Ah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The tip of the blade headed towards them.\u00a0</span><span>A piece of meat was on top of it.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta started using Ogre Slayer as a griddle to cook the meat.\u00a0</span><span>The masterpiece of the Golden Anvil Clan seemed greasy as the meat didn\u2019t stick to it, sliding smoothly with every flick of Crockta\u2019s wrist.</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Anor watched as he scattered salt on the meat. He wanted a moderate amount of time before turning the meat over.\u00a0</span><span>The surface was smooth and the insides lightly cooked. The concentrated juices were caught in the meat.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Anor looked down at their branches.\u00a0</span><span>The roasted meat was burnt and some leaves were clinging to it, making it look completely unappetizing. However, if they used smaller branches, then the wood would keep breaking.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta cut it with the blade.\u00a0</span><span>The perfect steak was shining right in front of them.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo and Anor watched Crockta\u2019s grilling and stared at his meat without realizing that their own cuts were burning.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta's hand moved slowly.\u00a0</span><span>The perfect steak was entering his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>The red juices would flow out when he bit it.\u00a0</span><span>The meat entering Crockta\u2019s mouth wasn\u2019t a simple meal, but a feast of flavor!</span></p><br/><p><span>For Tiyo and Anor, who hadn\u2019t enjoyed proper food due to the long camping, it was a delicacy.\u00a0</span><span>The first one to figure out the situation was Tiyo.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m sorry <em>dot</em>...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo bowed humbly.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at Anor.\u00a0</span><span>Anor noticed it and succumbed to Crockta\u2019s skills.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cEuh...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He flopped down.\u00a0</span><span>\"I want to eat steak...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stared at the two of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the hopes that they wouldn\u2019t fall prey to this evil path again, Crockta cried out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Say my name.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Who am I?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Anor raised their heads. Crockta was flashing a benevolent smile at them, like the face of a god in an old mural.\u00a0</span><span>They muttered blankly like they realized something, \u201cCrockta...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>'Yes, I am Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stood up and got the meat from Tiyo and Anor\u2019s side.\u00a0</span><span>Three big pieces were placed on Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>The greatsword was placed on the fire.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A very gracious warrior.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Anor repented over their behavior as they saw the sizzling meat.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We really arrived,\u201d muttered Warrior Surka.</span></p><br/><p><span>The great chieftain\u2019s harsh march eventually ended.\u00a0</span><span>They grabbed their weapons as they looked at the far-away fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span>Emeranian.\u00a0</span><span>A dark elf city.\u00a0</span><span>It was one of the most prosperous places on the outskirts of the dark elf territory.\u00a0</span><span>If they broke it down, they could immediately go to key cities like Nameragon and Lorgarch.\u00a0</span><span>Beyond them was the world tree.</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment they set fire to it, their victory would be confirmed.\u00a0</span><span>The north would fall and lay the foundations for the continent invasion. The great chieftain would make the whole north a tool for war and directly destroy the areas below them.</span></p><br/><p><span>What would the world be like after the conquest was over?</span></p><br/><p><span>Surka tried to let go of the thought.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is a city of weak people, garbage, made to be our slaves.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The great chieftain rose from the sedan.\u00a0</span><span>His rough voice rang out.\u00a0</span><span>The shaman made a gesture with his hand. </span></p><br/><p><span>The voice of the great chieftain rang out even further, \"Take that place. I will allow you to do whatever you want. Make that place yours. I am giving it all to you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His eyes were red.\u00a0</span><span>He looked around at the orcs.\u00a0</span><span>The orc soldiers were tired but they started to feel excited again.</span></p><br/><p><span>Surka also felt something unknown burn in his chest.\u00a0</span><span>His heart started beating wildly. It was the feeling just before the battle begun. He wanted to feel the weight of the axe in his hand and listen to the weapon.\u00a0</span><span>He felt a sense of liberation whenever wielding the axe. He wanted to split the enemy\u2019s head apart.</span></p><br/><p><span>Fight and win.\u00a0</span><span>These two thoughts dominated his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The operation is against those weak bastards.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The great chieftain descended from the sedan.\u00a0</span><span>It staggered for a moment. The slaves flinched but the great chieftain showed no signs of caring.\u00a0</span><span>He just calmly wielded the axe.\u00a0</span><span>Some of the slaves holding the sedan chair died, the center of gravity collapsed and the rest were crushed by the chair.</span></p><br/><p><span>The great chieftain jumped up immediately. He placed the weight of his whole body on the sedan. There was a snapping sound as bones were broken.\u00a0</span><span>The crushed slaves screamed.\u00a0</span><span>Blood flowed from beneath the sedan.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We can obtain many slaves there.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He laughed, \"I will run and break the gate.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The great chieftain stretched out his hand.\u00a0</span><span>A huge gate. It was a solid gate that wouldn\u2019t collapse even when shot several times with a siege weapon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will push them out.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Then he lifted his axe.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cFollow me. Slay! This operation will begin.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs raised their weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span>The warriors shouted, \"The Great Clan\u2019s victory!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The orc soldiers shouted along, \"Victory!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Surka was swept away by the voice of the great chieftain and the atmosphere here.\u00a0</span><span>He shouted along with the warriors, \"Death to the enemies of the Great Clan!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The orcs replied like they had been waiting, \u201cDeath!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a signal.\u00a0</span><span>The great chieftain started running.\u00a0</span><span>The orcs followed him.\u00a0</span><span>The harsh march obviously depleted their stamina but the orcs went on a rampage.\u00a0</span><span>Everybody ran without a fuss. There was a rain of arrows trying to stop them but they didn\u2019t care.</span></p><br/><p><span>The great chieftain.\u00a0</span><span>They could only see him running.\u00a0</span><span>The giant rushed towards the fortress.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuaaaaaaaaaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The great chieftain\u2019s body swelled.\u00a0</span><span>A red aura surrounded him.\u00a0</span><span>It was the speed of a beast.\u00a0</span><span>The ground rang as he ran towards the fortress. His goal was the gate.</span></p><br/><p><span>He raised the axe on his shoulder.\u00a0</span><span>It collided with the gate.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kuaaaaaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>One of them was broken.\u00a0</span><span>Dust rose.\u00a0</span><span>It was broken.\u00a0</span><span>Not the great chieftain but the gate.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThese garbage! Kill!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The great chieftain shouted as he entered. He swung his axe. The severed bodies of the dark elves flew.\u00a0</span><span>The great chieftain alone broke the line of defense inside the gate. Like a swarm of ants, the orcs surged inside.</span></p><br/><p><span>The slaughter began.\u00a0</span><span>No one could imagine the explosive and harsh march.\u00a0</span><span>In addition, the terrifying breakthrough.</span></p><br/><p><span>A massacre.\u00a0</span><span>That day, Emeranian was eliminated.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The news about the fall of Emeranian was conveyed to Caska.\u00a0</span><span>The whole unit was amazed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe need to go to Nameragon,\u201d she spoke curtly.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta didn\u2019t say anything. Her hometown was wiped out.\u00a0</span><span>Caska held herself accountable for the delayed march.</span></p><br/><p><span>Therefore, Caska\u2019s troops turned towards Nameragon instead of their home.\u00a0</span><span>Just yesterday, they had been on their way home. But now everything was gone.</span></p><br/><p><span>They left their hometown and walked towards Nameragon.\u00a0</span><span>She lost everything but her troops lowered their heads and grabbed each other\u2019s shoulders because they lost the same thing.</span></p><br/><p><span>When the emotions rose, they dropped their heads and cried.\u00a0</span><span>They couldn\u2019t stop. They continued to walk. They tried to suppress the cries of the heart with physical pain.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a harsh march.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0<strong>Next Patreon goal has been reached!!

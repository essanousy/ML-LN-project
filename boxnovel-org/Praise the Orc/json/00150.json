He was the king who would soon stand at the top.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It's a good day. I will cleanly accept the result today. In the name of the gods.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. I will as well. I hope Your Highness keeps the words you said beforehand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The king\u2019s eyes narrowed. Earl Alaste\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>The king asked, \u201cYou seem to have confidence. How is Galadin?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He\u2019s as upright as always. Do you want to see him?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It is enough to see you instead of that old man\u2019s face.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Both of them didn\u2019t avoid the other\u2019s eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c...Okay.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The king\u2019s lips twisted before he smiled and said, \"Once the sun comes up to the middle, the duel will start. I\u2019ll tell Adandator to control his strength in consideration for Galadin\u2019s old age.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Thank you for your words. Just...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Just?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGaladin won\u2019t be fighting today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What?\"\u00a0</span><span>The king gazed at the lord with a suspicious expression.\u00a0</span><span>\"Then who will come out?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You will see when the sun rises to the middle.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The king\u2019s face twisted at the lord\u2019s relaxed attitude.\u00a0</span><span>He was dissatisfied with the lord\u2019s relaxed attitude and confused about the unknown warrior.\u00a0</span><span>He spat out in a rough voice, \u201cYes, I\u2019ll see soon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They turned around and returned to their camps.\u00a0</span><span>Lord Alaste immediately sought out Crockta who was in a tent at the rear of the camp. His face was stiff with tension.\u00a0</span><span>However, he couldn\u2019t help smiling at the sight within the tent.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta was lying on a bed and humming, while Vigo was sitting next to the bed and fanning Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Are you cool?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHarder.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHiyah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do it properly. You will be responsible if my condition isn\u2019t good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo! Brother!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A knight should have a better wrist snap.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t seem like a warrior who had the fate of the city on his shoulders. That made him seem more reliable.\u00a0</span><span>This was none other than Northern Conqueror Crockta. He would clearly be able to cope with Adandator.</span></p><br/><p><span>Even Galadin acknowledged that Crockta was stronger than him. The lord decided to give up worrying.\u00a0</span><span>It had already left his hands. He had dealt the best hand he could.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cVigo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, Lord!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cFan him properly. The future of Alaste hangs on your fan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Cough! Yes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Anor came together and weren\u2019t worried at all. They were dozing in a corner of the tent. They had drunk alcohol all night.\u00a0</span><span>They were friends who had no tension at all.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, I want to thank you once again. Thank you for your willingness to go to such a dangerous place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul. There is no need for thanks, I am just doing the work of a warrior.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta leisurely stretched while enjoying the breeze from the fan.\u00a0</span><span>\"So when is the duel?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNoon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at the sky through the open gap in the tent.\u00a0</span><span>It was pretty soon.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Trumpets sounded.\u00a0</span><span>Both sides were nervous.\u00a0</span><span>The sun had risen above their heads. Now the duel would begin.\u00a0</span><span>It was a fight to determine the future of each side. So many things were involved.</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator appeared first.\u00a0</span><span>The king placed a hand on his shoulder and spoke to him. Adandator answered in a short manner.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is lively.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator was a beautiful young man. His body was well balanced.\u00a0</span><span>He was still young, but he was a seasoned knight who had gone through many battles.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then it was time for Alaste\u2019s representative to come out.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta walked forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The kingdom\u2019s side was shaken and murmurs gradually spread.\u00a0</span><span>They all expected the warrior for Alaste to be Galadin.\u00a0</span><span>It was common knowledge that the best knight in Alaste was Galadin, and there was no stronger knight.\u00a0</span><span>The kingdom was convinced of their victory because Galadin was too old compared to Adandator.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, a surprising figure appeared.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>An orc.\u00a0</span><span>A warrior with a heinous face and tattoos all over his body.\u00a0</span><span>His enormous mass and greatsword could be seen clearly from afar.</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator looked at him curiously.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t a tense face. He thought it would be a tragic comedy.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI am Adandator Paklinche. Who are you?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He was curious about the orc standing in front of him.\u00a0</span><span>\"Are you really the representative of Alaste?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded.\u00a0</span><span>The plains gradually became quiet.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta smiled and looked at Adandator.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cMy name is Crockta. I came from Orcrox and stand here to guard Alaste.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>He knew that name.\u00a0</span><span>It was the unidentified orc who killed the great chieftain and blocked them before the call for the northern war began in earnest.\u00a0</span><span>On that day, all the gods whispered to his name.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Alaste has prepared a hidden card.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His expression recovered and he lifted his sword.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator didn\u2019t use a greatsword like Crockta. It was a thin and long sword that looked elegant.\u00a0</span><span>Both of them used Paklinche\u2019s swordsmanship, but they had different attitudes and atmosphere.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta asked, \u201cDo you know Leyteno Paklinche?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHoh?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Adandator laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\"The traitor Leyteno. Orcs should know him. Yes, I know Leyteno. He is a coward on the side of the orcs. The traitor who turned his sword against us. That is why he is a blot to the rest of the Paklinche family. In the end, he died miserably.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA coward. A traitor. A blot.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta laughed out loud.</span></p><br/><p><span>The Leyteno that Crockta heard about was absolutely not a coward.\u00a0</span><span>He wasn\u2019t a traitor or a blot, but a shining star.\u00a0</span><span>The hero who followed the path of his sword.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone would\u2019ve blamed him. If Leyteno just closed his eyes and aimed his sword at the orcs, he could gain wealth and honor.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, he gritted his teeth and did what he believed was right.\u00a0</span><span>He wasn\u2019t a slave but his own master.\u00a0</span><span>If he followed the same direction that all the other fingers were pointing, he was just a slave.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, Leyteno shook his head and pointed to the other side alone.\u00a0</span><span>He straightened up, pointed to his own beliefs and moved.\u00a0</span><span>That was why he would stand forever in the Hall of Fame.\u00a0</span><span>Leyteno Paklinche would never die.\u00a0</span><span>None of the warriors in the Hall of Fame would die.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Right now, I will connect to Leyteno Paklinche\u2019s will.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta raised his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>As Crockta reached a higher ground, he had gone beyond Leyteno\u2019s swordsmanship but it was still alive in Ogre Slayer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Feel it yourself. Paklinche.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Show me your blade, Orc.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Adandator grinned.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou are ignorant. I can see an echo of the traitor. Okay, just once...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At this moment, everyone on the plains was watching Crockta and Adandator.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Let's do it!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator plunged in first.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta watched him.\u00a0</span><span>The world slowed.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator\u2019s handsome face was shining with a mixture of arrogance and self-confidence. Crockta\u2019s greatsword swung towards his shining face.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kaaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Adandator was a genius and was waiting for Crockta in the realm of the Pinnacle.\u00a0</span><span>The two blades met several times.\u00a0</span><span>It was a battle that ordinary eyes couldn\u2019t follow.\u00a0</span><span>They exchanged blows for a long time. As explosive sounds were heard from both sounds, small wounds appeared on their bodies.</span></p><br/><p><span>Blood splattered on both their faces.</span></p><br/><p><span>There would be cheers from both sides whenever dust rose as a result of the collision between swords.\u00a0</span><span>It was a fight of absolute power that could rarely be seen!</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Crockta\u2019s battle cry shook the plains.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tarrrrrrrrrr\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was like an earthquake occurred as the audience member\u2019s legs shook from the roar.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator, who faced it directly, felt like his heart was going to stop.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta's overwhelming presence was pouring toward him.\u00a0</span><span>As his eyes flicked, the trajectory of the greatsword flying towards him changed in a subtle way.</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator tried to block it but was thrown back by a huge power.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuheeok!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment of the attack, Crockta\u2019s fist struck Adandator\u2019s abdomen.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator flew through the air and landed on the ground.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta's powerful blow!</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Waaaaaaaaaaaah!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Alaste\u2019s side cheered. On the other hand, the side of the kingdom became completely quiet.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator stood up.\u00a0</span><span>He shuddered from the impact as blood poured from his nose.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed and raised his finger, signalling his opponent to quickly come at him.\u00a0</span><span>\"Kulkul, are you okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You aren\u2019t a mere child. I understand...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator laughed. He spat out the blood in his mouth. Then he took a serious posture with his sword.\u00a0</span><span>His body started to enter the Pinnacle. Over and over, he once again reached a high ground.\u00a0</span><span>The world was still.</span></p><br/><p><span>He jumped and brandished his sword at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta blocked it with Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>However, his skin was torn and blood poured out. Crockta hurriedly stepped back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>This time, it was the kingdom\u2019s side that cheered.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator smiled and repeated Crockta\u2019s words, \"Are you okay?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta responded with a smile, \"You also aren\u2019t a mere child.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKilkilkil.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta calmly raised Ogre Slayer.</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator was a genius.\u00a0</span><span>He could believe that.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator had surpassed the realm of the Pinnacle. It was the realm of the Hero that Crockta had learned while crossing life and death.\u00a0</span><span>If so, Crockta should do the same thing.</span></p><br/><p><span>The cheers and boos became mixed together. The sun was shining above their heads. Sweat was pouring down their cheeks as they recognized the weight of the weapons they held.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>A formidable opponent.\u00a0</span><span>A high level of swordsmanship where anyone could win was implemented.\u00a0</span><span>An interesting opponent.</span></p><br/><p><span>They moved their bodies while thinking the same thing.\u00a0</span><span>The strands of causality started to converge on both of them.\u00a0</span><span>The strands of causality stretched out like tentacles towards each other.\u00a0</span><span>One step, one stroke, a stepping motion, every time the blades moved, they aimed to create a life or death injury.</span></p><br/><p><span>Indeed, Paklinche\u2019s blood was very deep.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I never thought you would follow this far...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator was inwardly impatient.\u00a0</span><span>He was convinced that he could win without fail if Galadin was his opponent.\u00a0</span><span>But then this orc appeared instead of Galadin.\u00a0</span><span>His instincts sent a warning. They were both on the same ground.\u00a0</span><span>This orc had also surpassed the Pinnacle.</span></p><br/><p><span>Maybe he would die today.\u00a0</span><span>The chains of causality stretching from Crockta sought to swallow Adandator.</span></p><br/><p><span>The sun was blazing above his head.\u00a0</span><span>It was hot.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator\u2019s eyes were dazzled. If he was careless, the orc would cause him to die under this sun.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the infinitely slow world, Crockta and Adandator met each other. Sweat trickled down Adandator\u2019s face. But he never looked away.\u00a0</span><span>Now the plains were still.\u00a0</span><span>They felt that the fight had reached a realm that they didn\u2019t dare to evaluate.</span></p><br/><p><span>The first one to move was Adandator.\u00a0</span><span>He exploded his power in order to win the battle before it lengthened even further.\u00a0</span><span>Pressure rose from his body.\u00a0</span><span>His power reversed causation and rushed towards Crockta\u2019s death.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was like a tsunami was heading towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Numerous blades were aiming at his neck.\u00a0</span><span>Causality sped towards Crockta\u2019s death. Crockta aimed for Adandator\u2019s death and canceled out the attack.</span></p><br/><p><span>Blood poured from wounds on his limbs.\u00a0</span><span>The blades from Adandator inevitably fell towards Crockta from all angles.\u00a0</span><span>They pierced his shoulders, sides, and thighs at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta fell down.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWaaaaaaack!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Adandator didn\u2019t miss this gap and rushed forward. He wanted to finish this in one blow.</span></p><br/><p><span>A huge wave pushed towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Death seemed unstoppable.\u00a0</span><span>The handful of wind, bubbles, nail-sized mass and every other trivial thing could cause death.\u00a0</span><span>Compared to that, the tool called a sword, which was made to kill others, was like a large army advancing towards death.</span></p><br/><p><span>Dozens then hundreds of swords poured towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>The probability of survival and probability of death were reversed.\u00a0</span><span>Life itself led to death.\u00a0</span><span>However.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta whispered.\u00a0</span><span>As Adandator\u2019s tsunami of death flew towards him, he started weaving together the causation of the world.\u00a0</span><span>It was risky.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was the first time Crockta thought about death since the battle against the great chieftain.\u00a0</span><span>He needed to risk everything to overcome Adandator\u2019s blow. Crockta held Ogre Slayer. He would fight back with his life on the line.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, at that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta suddenly saw something.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018I am alive.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He didn\u2019t know what it was.\u00a0</span><span>However, Crockta instinctively leaned towards the line that was passing through the world.\u00a0</span><span>It was a color that was hard to describe.\u00a0</span><span>It was a color that didn\u2019t exist in the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>That line penetrated both the visible world that people could see, the world of the Pinnacle and the world of the Hero that reversed causality.\u00a0</span><span>Even death couldn\u2019t bear it.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Honor.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>What was that line?\u00a0</span><span>In addition, the color as well.\u00a0</span><span>Why was it so radiant?\u00a0</span><span>The moment that his body touched that line.\u00a0</span><span>The whole world pushed Crockta\u2019s back.\u00a0</span><span>It was a helping hand to raise all the sinking things.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta rushed towards the infinitely unfolding tsunami of death. He flew towards the infinite expanse of the abyss.</span></p><br/><p><span>Bul\u2019tarrrrrrrrrr\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!</span></p><br/><p><span>There was light.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a long fight.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta and Adandator gradually entered a state of fighting that couldn\u2019t be understood.\u00a0</span><span>Only a few senior ranking knights could feel the level.\u00a0</span><span>The two repeated the gains and losses as they kept attacking each other. Blood sporadically splattered but they didn\u2019t back down.</span></p><br/><p><span>The king stared blankly and inadvertently dropped his wine glass.\u00a0</span><span>However, the king and his knights were conscious of the pieces of glass.\u00a0</span><span>It might be a fight that they could never see again in their lives.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI can\u2019t believe it...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Adandator rushed like crazy.\u00a0</span><span>It was an attack on everything.\u00a0</span><span>As if a storm was taking place around his body, countless attacks were launched.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta blocked with his greatsword but fell down to one knee.</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator didn\u2019t miss this and chased him.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone sensed that it was the final blow.\u00a0</span><span>There was a black wave.</span></p><br/><p><span>In that instance, the kingdom was convinced that Adandator had won.\u00a0</span><span>It was a blow containing everything.\u00a0</span><span>No one could survive that hit.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then...</span></p><br/><p><span>A bolt of light.\u00a0</span><span>It was a very short moment.\u00a0</span><span>Light enveloped the plains.\u00a0</span><span>It was a color that had never been seen before. They didn\u2019t know what color it was. It destroyed Adandator\u2019s black wave.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The light disappeared and dust rose up.\u00a0</span><span>They could only see that Adandator\u2019s sword was broken and Crockta\u2019s Ogre Slayer was pointed at his neck.\u00a0</span><span>Silence fell over the plains.\u00a0</span><span>The winner and loser didn\u2019t move. There was silence. The clouds moving through the sky stopped.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then a gnome standing on Alaste\u2019s side broke the silence.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKahahahat! Victory <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was no tension in the voice.\u00a0</span><span>Then Alaste\u2019s side understood the situation and started cheering. They threw their weapons and helmets and yelled.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone embraced each other as they shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWaaaaaaah!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe won!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHooray Alaste!

Only a red blood stain remained where the snake was.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s group gazed at the place where the snake disappeared and then looked at each other. It was a humid place that gave off an eerie feeling.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cShould we continue <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Where else should we go?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Call back the thunderbird...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Chirpppppppp...!\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta cleared his throat and stepped forward first.\u00a0</span><span>He realized it when he took the first step. His boots sank down a little bit. It was slippery mud, but not enough to stop them from walking.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We can walk.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He stepped into the forest with all his weight.\u00a0</span><span>\"It feels bad.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The air was humid. It felt like poisonous insects would appear out of nowhere.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta walked a few steps and waved his hand.\u00a0</span><span>He watched the place where the snake was hiding. The serpent\u2019s blood remained and the bark and vegetation that it touched was being corroded away.\u00a0</span><span>It was an awful poison.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe serpent.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta looked back at the party and said, \"Let\u2019s pass through it quickly. Be careful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, their expressions weren\u2019t bright. Rather, they seemed surprised. Tiyo pointed to Crockta with his mouth open.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta shrugged and said, \u201cWhat? Is everybody scared? Only this much...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Dduk.</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, something fell on his shoulders.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta raised his head.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Shaaaah-!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>A giant snake\u2019s mouth was wide up open towards Crockta. Venom was dripping from the sharp fangs. \u00a0</span><span>Crockta was so surprised that he couldn\u2019t make a sound. The snake gradually approached. Poison dripped from its fangs.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta couldn\u2019t express his surprise but instinctively swung his sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Waaahhhhhhhh!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment he wielded God Slayer,</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Shaaaah!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The snake was frightened and twisted its head but it ended up slashed in half.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta hurriedly avoided it, but it was inevitable that some blood touched his body. Pain radiated from where the poisonous blood had hit.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta hurriedly rushed away from the radius of the dying snake.\u00a0</span><span>He touched his shoulder. The skin was melted due to the poisonous liquid. The poison continued to cause pain. His face distorted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuk, this snake bastard...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Pain and anger jumbled together. He lifted God Slayer and slashed the snake again and again.\u00a0</span><span>The snake was eventually cut into dozens of pieces.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPant, pant.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta took deep breaths.\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo carefully approached and asked, \"A-are you okay <em>dot</em>...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThe place where the poison touched it a little painful.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPoison? I have no knowledge about poison <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus spoke, \u201cShow me your shoulders.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>A hunter probably knew about different types of serpents. He looked at both the snake\u2019s body and Crockta\u2019s shoulder before pulling something out.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oh, is there an antidote <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It isn\u2019t an antidote but any experienced hunter would know...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a potion.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cPotions are the best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus sprinkled the potion on Crockta\u2019s shoulder. Then the pain began. Potions were truly the best against poison.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed, potions are the best.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is a good idea to buy a lot when there is a discount.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will remember that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta sprinkled potions on every painful spot on his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Anyway, it isn\u2019t easy.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zankus looked at the forest and said.\u00a0</span><span>There were two huge snakes from the beginning. In addition, they had terrible poison. It would be dangerous.\u00a0</span><span>However, nobody said to go back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBreak through the front. That is our way <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo lifted General in a ready stance and moved forward.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta, Zankus, and Anor followed.\u00a0</span><span>After entering the swamp, the ecology had completely changed.\u00a0</span><span>The animals and creatures had disappeared, leaving only strange insects and plants that they saw for the first time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is a more dangerous place than the ogres\u2019 habitat in the great forest.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The dangers in this swamp went beyond the level of being threatened by ogres.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t a physical threat, but the insects and unknown ecology weren\u2019t something Crockta\u2019s group had experienced before.\u00a0</span><span>A snake biting them out of nowhere was scarier than a dozen ogres.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Be careful...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Crockta took the lead, Anor was in the middle and Zankus followed in the rear.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta gazed at the shaded forest and walked carefully. The mud of the swamp grabbed at their feet with every step.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta, to the right!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>All of a sudden, Zankus shouted.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta immediately pulled out his greatsword and swung it to the right.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuaaaang!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This time, it was a leopard. Patterns covered its entire body. Once the surprise attack failed, the leopard landed on the ground and gazed at Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A leopard is attacking me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta laughed.\u00a0</span><span>He was a friend of the great tiger Simba, the king of the forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Get lost. Then I will spare your life.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Perhaps it felt the terrible pressure coming from Crockta, but the leopard started to flee.\u00a0</span><span>It was at that moment.\u00a0</span><span>On the floor where nothing seemed to be present, something bit the leopard. The long and fat body entwined around the leopard in a flash.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a snake.\u00a0</span><span>The leopard was unable to resist and became the snake\u2019s prey. The snake bit the leopard and then looked at Crockta\u2019s group. </span><span>Crockta\u2019s mouth twisted as he lifted God Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>The snake realized it couldn\u2019t afford to go against them and turned away. The leopard\u2019s dead body disappeared somewhere along with the snake.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is a really dangerous place.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A place where camouflaged enemies awaited their prey.\u00a0</span><span>That was this place, the swamp.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Wait a minute.\"\u00a0</span><span>Anor said, telling them to shut up.\u00a0</span><span>\"From the snake who just left...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Before Anor could finish speaking, the sparrow on his head flew to a certain place.\u00a0</span><span>It was the direction that the snake had disappeared in.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What <em>dot</em>? Did you send it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. It is moving at will.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well, I can feel something from the direction that the snake left in.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Anor looked in that direction with a determined face.\u00a0</span><span>\"There is something there. I don\u2019t know exactly what.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is something related to a necromancer, perhaps a dungeon or artifact.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus nodded. Tiyo shouted.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Okay, then we should go there <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I wonder what will happen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul, it is a new adventure.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Anor was baffled,\u00a0</span><span>\"No, I mean, it will be dangerous...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAnor! Let\u2019s go dot! Lead the way!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI was saying be careful and don\u2019t go...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Guide us <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>They went through the swamp for a while.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus examined the tracks on the ground; his hunter\u2019s eyes found signs of snakes in many places.\u00a0</span><span>The snakes were heading in the direction that Anor felt the power.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWhat will it be <em>dot</em>? Perhaps you are just imagining it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo. There is definitely something.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked around.\u00a0</span><span>In fact, he also felt something.\u00a0</span><span>The Demon\u2019s Mouth around his waist was rattling.\u00a0</span><span>It hadn\u2019t woken up in a while. The guy inside was still asleep, but the belt was dragging him in the same direction as Anor\u2019s feeling. It felt like he was being pulled.\u00a0</span><span>There was a feeling that something might be on the other end.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>And there really was something.</span></p><br/><p><span>A stone pyramid greeted them. It was covered with moss and bushes, but it was definitely a pyramid. The scale was greater than they imagined.\u00a0</span><span>The snake they pursued was also near the pyramid. In addition to that, there were several snakes crawling around the pyramid.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"There must be something in that pyramid.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zankus was already giving an interested smiled.\u00a0</span><span>\"The entrance is there. Is it locked?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a doorway under the pyramid, but it was firmly closed.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s companions exchanged glances and approached.\u00a0</span><span>The snakes realized there were intruders and raised their heads. Their forked tongues hissed at Crockta\u2019s group.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta pulled out God Slayer. The snakes\u2019 heads reared back.\u00a0</span><span>As Crockta pointed the big sword at them, the snakes couldn\u2019t get closer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cSmart guys.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The serpents stared at them as they stood at the entrance.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus grabbed the door handle and pulled.\u00a0</span><span>It was firmly locked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It won't open.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo and Anor also pulled once, but it didn\u2019t open. Zankus examined the door. It was built firmly and no gaps could be seen.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta went forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I\u2019ll open it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Tiyo shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is a locked door. You can\u2019t open this...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Sururung!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Crockta moved his hand and the door opened with a grinding sound.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone was surprised when it opened so easily.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHow...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus nodded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The door seems to have magic that judges people based on whether they are qualified or not.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cQualified?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It might be a place for Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They all looked at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>His companions always forgot, but Crockta was a fearsome warrior who won against the great chieftain in the north and defeated the empire\u2019s large army alone. He wasn\u2019t an ordinary orc.\u00a0</span><span>The pyramid acknowledged Crockta.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta coughed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hmm, let\u2019s enter.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The admiration of the party continued.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Truly Crockta...my companion <em>dot</em>!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAmazing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkul, this child has become like this...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta ignored them, moving forward while muttering,\u00a0</span><span>\"If pulling doesn\u2019t work, push the door...\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The pyramid was in the center of a humid swamp, but the interior was completely dry. It was rather dry.\u00a0</span><span>What was this place?\u00a0</span><span>The snakes had hovered around, as if they were guarding the pyramid. They had to be guarding something.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you still feel it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta asked Anor.\u00a0</span><span>Anor nodded. He looked around the pyramid, as if he were trying to pick up that energy.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta also felt the Demon\u2019s Mouth responding at his waist.\u00a0</span><span>Something existed here that had to do with both necromancy and the Demon\u2019s Mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThere doesn\u2019t seem to be anything dangerous.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta placed God Slayer back on his back. \u00a0</span><span>There were no snakes or insects inside the pyramid. The monsters guarding dungeons couldn\u2019t be seen. They kept moving forward.</span></p><br/><p><span>Suddenly, Zankus said,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cStrange.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"What are you saying <em>dot</em>?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We\u2019ve been walking for a long time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Was the pyramid that big?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>They had walked in a straight line from the entrance.\u00a0</span><span>The pyramid wasn\u2019t small, but they shouldn\u2019t have been walking so long.\u00a0</span><span>However, they had already been walking for a long time.\u00a0</span><span>Zankus placed the light he was holding on to the ground and measured something.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is it going downhill?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta asked?\u00a0</span><span>As he said, the ground was at a slight slope that was leading underground. If so, it was possible for them to walk that long.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zankus shook his head.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Something is going on.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked at the end of the passage. The Demon\u2019s Mouth at his waist kept pulling him.\u00a0</span><span>There was something at the end of this path.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Keep going. What will be in here?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGo dot!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>They kept walking.\u00a0</span><span>At the end of the passage, a large space appeared. The ceiling was high and something unknown was emitting a light.\u00a0</span><span>However, the glow wasn\u2019t blinding.\u00a0</span><span>The light source illuminated the inside of the space so that they could see clearly, but it was calm enough that they could open their eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWho are you?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s group turned towards the voice.\u00a0</span><span>A man was looking at them. The man was impeccably dressed and didn\u2019t seem to suit the pyramid.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAn orc and gnome. A dark elf...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>But Crockta could see it.\u00a0</span><span>There was a tail coming from the back of the man\u2019s suit.\u00a0</span><span>The tail resembled a scorpion\u2019s and the tip was sharp.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I will start the introductions.

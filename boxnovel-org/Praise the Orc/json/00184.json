I came on my own.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see.\u00a0</span><span>Any young blacksmith will come here at least once. And the Slayer Maker is qualified enough.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou're overpraising me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve seen the Wizard Slayer that you created.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kang!</span></i><i><span>Kang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Rastad looked at the place where the sound came from.\u00a0</span><span>In one corner, a dwarf was hammering on iron. The heated piece of iron was struck by the hammer and slowly changed shaped. Then the hammering sped up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is a quick and fast sword.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cA big weapon isn\u2019t needed to kill a magician.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat's right. It was excellent. Who is using the sword now?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou truly resemble Solardo.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Rastad smiled bitterly.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWizard Slayer is now in the hands of a lunatic who hates magicians. Numerous innocent magicians have died at his hand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro shrugged.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cIt has nothing to do with me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou truly are Solardo\u2019s clan member.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Rastad laughed out loud.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYes, Slayer Maker. What monster will you make at the last forge here? This time, will it be an ogre slayer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI already created that.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh, I see. It is a weapon against ogres, but the owner will surely suffer.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro shrugged at Rastad\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span>He\u2019d met the orc warrior who used Ogre Slayer and seen him kill an ogre easily. The greatsword was too big, but when it entered the orc\u2019s hands, it felt like it had been made for him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro smiled,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cSince you\u2019ve completed Ogre Slayer, is it now a dragon slayer?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDragon Slayer...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Dragons were an invisible and forgotten species. At one time, they flew over mountains and valleys regularly, but now people never saw them.\u00a0</span><span>Some said that they were all dead, while others said they were hidden somewhere. \u00a0However, one thing was certain, which was that the dragons wouldn\u2019t regain their former glory.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMy sword would lose if I make such a thing.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed, it is impossible to use a sword to fight against a dragon. Then what about a second version of Ogre Slayer? There is trouble with ogres in this area.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro\u2019s face darkened.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI will think about it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He had left the Golden Anvil Clan because of this.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro surpassed the level of young craftsmen. At a young age, he had already become a top blacksmith, and his Slayer series were masterpieces which everyone wanted. Many warriors and knights had asked him to make weapons for them.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, now, he didn\u2019t have a blueprint for the next piece.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t have an image which made him want to work the metal enthusiastically.\u00a0</span><span>In the old days, the true face hidden in the iron had been visible.\u00a0</span><span>But there was nothing now. He had broken several attempts and beat the iron only to melt it again. So, his slump had become prolonged.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou are young.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Rastad tapped his shoulder.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cDon\u2019t be in a rush. Stay and think slowly. You can stay in the blacksmith\u2019s quarters.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is the last forge, a place where you can beat iron as long as the sun shines. Hahaha. I guess I should look at that person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Rastad approached the blacksmith who was hammering the iron.\u00a0</span><span>The blacksmith was a dwarf younger than Zakiro. He didn\u2019t have the skills, but he had a passion for hammering iron.\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro watched them for a while before leaving the last forge.</span></p><br/><p><span>The dwarf who was the sun god\u2019s priest saw him and bowed. Zakiro greeted him politely as well.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>By the time he left the temple of the sun god, it was dark.\u00a0</span><span>Geherad was quiet. There were occasional raucous sounds from the pubs, but most of the buildings had turned off their lights.\u00a0</span><span>It was a land of the temple of the sun god. They slept early and looked forward to the sunrise, rather than staying up at night.</span></p><br/><p><span>At that moment...</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Chaeng!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro heard a noise.\u00a0</span><span>He turned around.\u00a0</span><span>As a blacksmith, it was a sound which was impossible for him not to know.\u00a0</span><span>It was the sound of weapons hitting each other. A battle was occurring somewhere, and the sound of the metal was strangely familiar.</span></p><br/><p><span>He had heard that sound many times over the past few days.\u00a0</span><span>It was the sound of Ogre Slayer smashing monsters.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was fighting.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro started running.\u00a0</span><span>The sound was coming from a corner of Geherad, where people rarely went. It was dark, but he ran using the light of the moon and the sound.\u00a0</span><span>As Zakiro approached, iron flashed in the darkness.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A group of people was surrounding Crockta and a man. The two of them were exchanging blows.\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro moved closer and saw Tiyo and Anor, who spotted him and waved.</span></p><br/><p><span>He stood next to them.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWhat is this...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cStrange guys picked a fight with us <em>dot</em>.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo explained,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cThey said we would be punished according to a divine message\u2026 Strange guys <em>dot</em>.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro knew about the divine message. All the gods wanted Crockta and the orcs to die.\u00a0</span><span>These people were probably fanatical followers of the gods. To them, the commands of the gods were absolute.</span></p><br/><p><span>Indeed, the group of hooded men holding weapons was watching Crockta and the man fight, as if it was a sacred ceremony.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cGreat <em>dot</em>. Being able to fight against Crockta...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Tiyo muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, Zakiro couldn\u2019t tell. His vision had adapted to the darkness to some extent, but their swords were moving too quickly for him to see.\u00a0</span><span>Every time a light flashed, someone received damage and stepped back.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta, the person who conquered the north and obstructed the empire... He had killed the crazy chieftain in the north and defeated the empire\u2019s genius, Adandator.\u00a0</span><span>However, a nameless fanatic was matching him in the fight.</span></p><br/><p><span>The two chose to catch their breath for a moment.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta stared at the man, and suspicions about the opponent filled his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>It was an expression which showed the fight wasn\u2019t going according to his will.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro followed Crockta\u2019s gaze towards the opponent. The hood was torn, so the opponent\u2019s face was revealed. It was a middle-aged man. He looked at Crockta with a calm expression.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he declared,\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou can\u2019t resist the power of the gods. Accept your fate, Crockta.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was at this moment that Zakiro realized something.\u00a0</span><span>There was a faint light coming from the man\u2019s sword.\u00a0</span><span>Magic swords were able to exert such power. However, Zakiro saw that it wasn\u2019t a magic sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>God\u2019s soldier...</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s opponent wasn\u2019t a warrior who was good at the sword.\u00a0</span><span>However, he had the power of a god itself.\u00a0</span><span>A god\u2019s power was coming down to the man through that sword. It wasn\u2019t the god\u2019s full power as there were constraints about using divine power against mortals. However, this was enough to aim at Crockta\u2019s neck.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man wielded his sword again.\u00a0</span><span>A light flashed.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Crockta blocked the sword with Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>Then he stepped back.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUgh.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIn the name of the gods!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro could see it.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta's sword, Ogre Slayer, was shaking.\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro was a blacksmith, a master who heard the voice of the iron and the sword.\u00a0</span><span>Just like how a warrior saw the paths through the opponent\u2019s gap in order to kill them, Zakiro had an eye for seeing through metals and weapons.</span></p><br/><p><span>In his eyes, Ogre Slayer looked like a boxer who barely blocked the punch.</span></p><br/><p><span>It had won many fights but hadn\u2019t healed properly, causing the wounds to accumulate. Its broken bones set wrong, and its wounds filled with pus. A punch to the head caused damage which would make the hands shake.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, nevertheless, Ogre Slayer still looked straight at the opponent.\u00a0</span><span>This was a fight, and the opponent was still in the ring.\u00a0</span><span>A fighter who wouldn\u2019t collapse when weak...\u00a0</span><span>That was Ogre Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>And Zakiro was the father who had made Ogre Slayer.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBul\u2019tar\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s roar shook Geherad...</span></p><br/><p><span>And Crockta\u2019s speed increased.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man stepped back from Crockta\u2019s power.\u00a0</span><span>An unknown swordsmanship was being used with Zakiro\u2019s sword as Ogre Slayer implemented an unknown power.\u00a0</span><span>The man\u2019s sword bounced off, and Ogre Slayer aimed towards the gap.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, it was blocked.\u00a0</span><span>This was the god\u2019s power.\u00a0</span><span>Opportunities were equally given to both sides.\u00a0</span><span>The enemy\u2019s attack flew when Crockta\u2019s blow was deflected towards the ground. The sword had a white haze around it.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Crockta raised Ogre Slayer.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kaaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>At that moment, Zakiro thought that Ogre Slayer would break.\u00a0</span><span>However, it managed to hold on.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta blocked the attack and kicked the man\u2019s elbow. The sword was momentarily lowered. Then Crockta turned and swung his greatsword at the man.</span></p><br/><p><span>It seemed like this fight was over.\u00a0</span><span>However, the man\u2019s sword swung around in the air, as if a thread was tied to it. Then it moved into a position to stop Crockta\u2019s sword.\u00a0</span><span>The man grabbed his sword and inserted strength into his legs.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kwaaaaang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>Once again, the two swords collided.\u00a0</span><span>The man was pushed back.\u00a0</span><span>It was a power struggle.\u00a0</span><span>The dim light from the man\u2019s sword enlarged to cover his body, and his eyes shone white. The god\u2019s power was encroaching on his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>His sword became faster. It aimed at Crockta from every direction. Thanks to the gods, the man\u2019s attacks were swift and powerful.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, Crockta\u2019s Ogre Slayer defended against all attacks. It endured, and the reaction was marvelous.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta was really one with the sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIs that really my sword...?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro muttered.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was beautiful swordsmanship.\u00a0</span><span>However, it wasn\u2019t beautiful due to smooth movements or gentle curves...\u00a0</span><span>But because the sword and owner were one.\u00a0</span><span>All types of movements were completed with the big greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro couldn\u2019t tell if Crockta was leading the sword, or if the sword was leading him. The sword was connected to Crockta, and they moved as one.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Crockta hit his opponent\u2019s abdomen.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c</span><i><span>Cough!</span></i><span>\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta immediately swung the greatsword at his opponent.</span></p><br/><p><i><span>Kakang!</span></i></p><br/><p><span>The enemy\u2019s sword flew through the air. It rolled across the ground and stopped at Zakiro\u2019s feet.\u00a0</span><span>The dim light faded, and it became dark.\u00a0</span><span>The god left.\u00a0</span><span>Zakiro picked up the sword. It wasn\u2019t a bad sword, but it wasn\u2019t superb craftsmanship. It was just a fairly decent sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>He raised his head and looked at Crockta and the man.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s greatsword was pointed at the man\u2019s neck. The man slowly opened his eyes. He saw Crockta and the sword pointed at his neck. He didn\u2019t know what to do.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTell me about the divine message.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta demanded.</span></p><br/><p><span>The man mumbled something.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro felt something strange while watching the scene.\u00a0</span><span>The man wasn\u2019t a great warrior... He was just a fanatic. His sword wasn\u2019t exceptional... It was just a decent sword.\u00a0</span><span>He was like a grain of sand compared to Crockta, a orc \u00a0with a proper sword.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, when the man used the power of the gods, he could fight against the \u2018Northern Conqueror.\u2019\u00a0</span><span>This was the power of the gods.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta won now, but he would eventually fall. All the gods wanted his death.</span></p><br/><p><span>What if this power was used on a stronger person with a better sword?</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Ogre Slayer...\u00a0</span><span>The beautiful dance of the two would end soon.\u00a0</span><span>It was inevitable.\u00a0</span><span>After all, it wasn\u2019t an ogre they were facing.\u00a0</span><span>The gods...\u00a0</span><span>No matter how good Ogre Slayer was, it couldn\u2019t kill a god.\u00a0</span><span>However...</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI want to keep watching.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>As long as the sun still blazed, the last forge wouldn\u2019t turn off.\u00a0</span><span>Likewise, Zakiro hoped that the beautiful combination of Crockta and Ogre Slayer wouldn\u2019t end.\u00a0</span><span>The sword he made was more than a sword, and the harmony with its owner was a miracle he wanted to last forever.</span></p><br/><p><span>Zakiro wanted to do it.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis is also destiny.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A warrior had to fight.\u00a0</span><span>For a warrior to survive, he must kill without dying...\u00a0</span><span>And in order to kill, he needed a weapon that could kill.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

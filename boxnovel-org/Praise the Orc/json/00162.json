Haha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator was a named NPC. He was called the strongest knight in the south, a land with the largest number of human users.\u00a0</span><span>Another named NPC, Northern Conqueror Crockta had beaten Adandator in a duel.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta and Adandator were now sitting in front of them. This was the best place as a user of Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I guess you grew up with a spoon in \u00a0your mouth,\u201d Crockta suddenly said.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLook at you abandoning your country because your sword is blocked. You are a noble, yet you grew up into such a selfish person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The members of \u2018He\u2019s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy\u2019 looked at Adandator after Crockta\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span>Adandator sat there pretending to be unconcerned, but his hands were shaking.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Besides, aren\u2019t I stronger because I work hard and have talent? Then this prideful guy appeared.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYou bastard!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Adandator couldn\u2019t bear it anymore and jumped up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cDo you want to play again?\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta laughed while tapping his greatsword.</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator took deep breaths and closed his eyes, before slowing sinking back into his seat.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well done.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta explained to the \u2018He\u2019s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy\u2019 members.\u00a0</span><span>\"This is what I call re-socialization. The process of regaining anger control and sociability...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Not true!\"\u00a0</span><span>Adandator pulled out his sword and pointed it at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>\"Let\u2019s do it again!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta shrugged and said, \"You still need some lessons in socialization.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta got up from his spot.\u00a0</span><span>It didn\u2019t take long this time.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta dragged Adandator, who was now limp, and placed him next to the pot.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Kulkulkul.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Adandator raised his head as he slowly regained his spirit.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuoong...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He held his head and groaned as if it were in pain.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt smells good.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta didn\u2019t care and examined the contents of the pot.\u00a0</span><span>The stew meat that Crockta had hunted and the forest\u2019s spices and herbs. The meat wasn\u2019t spared and rose to the surface, revealing all of the fat.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It might be hard later so enjoy this meal.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The \u2018He\u2019s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy\u2019 members grew nervous at Crockta\u2019s words.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta\u2019s letters had brought the emperor\u2019s wrath upon them, and now the empire\u2019s great army would come.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta made his enemies come to him, meaning that while the other areas would be safe, they were in a more deadly crisis.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You can escape at any time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo,\u201d they replied.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta nodded.\u00a0</span><span>The Heaven and Earth Clan was among the enemies. There were only a few \u2018He\u2019s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy\u2019 users here, but they would try their best.\u00a0</span><span>They followed Crockta despite knowing this risk.</span></p><br/><p><span>The silent Adandator suddenly asked, \u201cDo you really believe you can win?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He knew the empire well. Then he told Crockta what he knew.\u00a0</span><span>The empire was too big to break down with this power.\u00a0</span><span>Apart from the well-trained troops, the abundant crops were endlessly harvested. Furthermore, the knights and magicians were trained with an organized system.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta might be strong but he couldn\u2019t deal with all those people. It might be possible with that flash of light, but it wasn\u2019t enough because Crockta couldn\u2019t fully use it yet.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Winning or losing isn\u2019t important.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta grinned.\u00a0</span><span>He hit the shoulder of Adandator, a knight who still hadn\u2019t learned anything.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'm a warrior. A warrior pays back any favor or vengeance.\u201d</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The troops gathered.</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel looked at them and smiled. It was the greatest number of soldiers he had ever commanded.\u00a0</span><span>The well-trained soldiers, knights and the Heaven and Earth members who always moved like his limbs, they were all in his grasp.</span></p><br/><p><span>He rode his horse to the forefront of the formation. The rider flying the flag of the empire was close behind him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes spoke up from next to him, \"Rommel.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Did you receive the quest?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cNow is the real start.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes\u2019 face was excited.\u00a0</span><span>As soon as the emperor gave them a command, a quest had been received. It was a large-scale linked quest that had never appeared in Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>[This is a large-scale linked quest on the continent.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Raise the fires of the species war!]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Deal with the rebels in the south and remove all impure molecules.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[The completion conditions are as follows.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Get rid of the empire\u2019s public enemy, Crockta.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Occupy Espada, which has rejected the empire.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Unite the south under the name of the empire.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[There are three conditions.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Adequate compensation will be given upon completion. Good luck.]</span></p><br/><p><span>All members of the Heaven and Earth Clan received the quest.\u00a0</span><span>It was the largest scale ever, so all the clan members were excited.\u00a0</span><span>Looking at the momentum of the empire, it was enough to complete the quest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe will resolve it in order,\u201d said Rommel. \u00a0</span><span>He was staring at the quest window in the air.\u00a0</span><span>\"Get rid of Crockta and then go to Espada. After that, the south will be one.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hrmm...\"\u00a0</span><span>Keynes smiled and asked, \"Should we really do that?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He is trying to bring us into his domain, so we should show him how silly that idea is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel thought about it and nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\"I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We will let that cocky orc bastard know the gap between us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Will the NPCs follow?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We have this.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>It was an edict delegating full authority to them.\u00a0</span><span>\"If he wants to draw aggro, we should draw the aggro back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After listening to Keynes, Rommel raised his hand and the rider raised the flag. A horn sound was transmitted towards all the troops.\u00a0</span><span>Rommel and Keynes starting moving.\u00a0</span><span>The army was one step behind them. The troops began to move forward. The knights escorted the formation in the wings, while the soldiers walked towards the battlefield with their spears.\u00a0</span><span>The scouts moved ahead of the procession. The army was spread out in rows and columns.</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel asked as he looked at the backs of the scouts, \"Will he come?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHe will come.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Keynes smiled.\u00a0</span><span>\"It is obvious when looking at his track record. We don't need to go looking for him.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel and Keynes turned.\u00a0</span><span>The army followed them.\u00a0</span><span>They headed towards the other side of Nataliya Forest.</span></p><br/><p><span>One of the knights from the White Lion Knights approached them.\u00a0</span><span>He was the deputy leader who led the knights, as Adandator was currently ill. He was an experienced knight.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNataliya Forest isn\u2019t in this direction.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Keynes replied with a smile, \"We aren\u2019t going to Nataliya.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Crockta is at Nataliya.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Sir Betring doesn\u2019t know him well: Crockta isn\u2019t a normal person. He is a shameless guy, so we can\u2019t allow things to go as he wants.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is a lesson I taught before. Don\u2019t go into the enemy\u2019s trap; lure the enemy into your own.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I remember.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is the same thing. Crockta tried to lure us, but we won\u2019t fall for it. Instead, we will bring him to us.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Betring nodded at the words. His face was convinced.\u00a0</span><span>\"I understand what you want to do. But are you sure he will come?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The direction they were heading wasn\u2019t towards Nataliya.\u00a0</span><span>It was Espada.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Of course. He is a righteous person.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hah...\"\u00a0</span><span>Betring looked up at the sky.\u00a0</span><span>\"If he was born a human, he would\u2019ve been a knight. It is a pity.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Instead, we have you and Sir Adandator.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I still can\u2019t be compared to Sir Adandator.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\"I do like those words. Anyway, I understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Betring returned to the White Lion Knights.\u00a0</span><span>Keynes looked at his back and chuckled.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Disgusting.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"We know that we are bad guys, but they are just deluding themselves. They aren\u2019t knights, just iron-clad contractors.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Your words are correct.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Rommel thought about Crockta and declared,\u00a0</span><span>\"Crockta is the best knight.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, that's right.\"\u00a0</span><span>Keynes shrugged.\u00a0</span><span>\"An orc is the one who acts more like a knight than anyone else. How funny. That is how he became the empire\u2019s public enemy and our stumbling block. This is why life is funny.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>A public enemy was closer to a knight than the actual knights.\u00a0</span><span>Those knights were now under Keynes and Rommel\u2019s leadership, who were villains.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It means there is no god.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Rommel turned and waved his hand. It was towards a member of the Heaven and Earth Clan.\u00a0</span><span>Other than Rommel, he was the most well-known member of Heaven and Earth.</span></p><br/><p><span>The one responsible for Heaven and Earth\u2019s public relations.\u00a0</span><span>BJ Heaven and Earth.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Hey, BJ.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Start the broadcast.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A large-scale quest is in progress and the goal is to unite the south.

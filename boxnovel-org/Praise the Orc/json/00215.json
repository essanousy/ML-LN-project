From there, white snowflakes started to fall.\u00a0</span><span>No, instead of snow, it was white ash.\u00a0</span><span>Simultaneously, a huge pillar of light fell from the hole towards the temple. The magnificent sight of ash and light filled his vision.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then Paimon\u2019s mouth dropped open.\u00a0</span><span>He stretched out his arms towards the sky, and tears flowed from his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAhhhhh...!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Paimon fell to his knees.\u00a0</span><span>Then he shouted towards the sky.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI knew you would come back!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He grabbed his head.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cI knew you would come back!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The gigantic pillar of light dimmed and became a white circle.\u00a0</span><span>Someone was descending in the middle.\u00a0</span><span>With a woman\u2019s appearance...\u00a0</span><span>She was the mother of the dead, who touched all of the dead with her white hair.\u00a0</span><span>The grey god...\u00a0</span><span>It was her.\u00a0</span><span>She slowly descended towards Paimon.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Her hands touched Paimon.\u00a0</span><span>He was the one who had endured for a long time after the grey god had fallen and the demons had been destroyed. Paimon\u2019s tired spirit fully recovered through her touch today.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now, the power of the grey god flowed in his body.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting for you! I believed all this time that you would come back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIt is nothing. It was a pleasure for me to wait.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYour words make me laugh.\u201d The grey god smiled. \u201cPaimon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes, Mother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI want to finish the work that I didn\u2019t finish long ago.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Paimon raised his head.\u00a0</span><span>Above his head, the grey god was laughing. It was a bright and beautiful smile.\u00a0</span><span>As the ash fluttered and the light flowed down, the expression in the grey god\u2019s eyes remained unchanged.</span></p><br/><p><span>She wanted to end this world to save it.\u00a0</span><span>The demons, who had witnessed the end of the world with her, decided to help her.\u00a0</span><span>All the gods had struck back.\u00a0</span><span>They had been defeated.\u00a0</span><span>The grey god had fallen to another dimension because of the gods.\u00a0</span><span>The demons had been devastated.\u00a0</span><span>Then a long time passed, and they were forgotten.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, Paimon had never once felt doubtful.\u00a0</span><span>The grey god\u2019s infinite compassion towards the world and her sublime will...\u00a0</span><span>Her sincerity to save the world had caused her to fall into the void.</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god asked Paimon, \u201cWill you help me?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He replied without any hesitation, \u201cYes.\u201d Paimon nodded. \u201cI will.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d </span></p><br/><p><span>Then the grey god waved her hands again.\u00a0</span><span>A huge chain of light started to form around the light pillar.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI crashed into an unknown dimension due to the other gods, and a new world was present. It is a world completely different from this one. The universe there is so young and beautiful. The longer I stayed there, the less I found myself able to endure our pitiful world.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The divine power caused an earth earthquake, and the ground shook.\u00a0</span><span>Now, the mighty beings of the world could feel her appearance. It was a force huge enough to swallow the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019m back. I\u2019m sorry for the humans of the world I used, but there is no other way.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will follow Mother.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI won\u2019t fail this time.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Her white power emerged into the air.\u00a0</span><span>The purely white sphere...</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a lump of power.\u00a0</span><span>The sphere floated in the middle of the light pillar. Simultaneously, the stem of light, which stretched out from the grey god, embraced the Temple of the Fallen God.\u00a0</span><span>The area was now a space controlled by the grey god.</span></p><br/><p><span>She declared, \u201cSorry, World. It isn\u2019t the fault of anyone born in this age. The procession of life and death is just like this.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The white sphere started to rise into the sky. Then it gradually expanded. It doubled, tripled, and eventually became huge.\u00a0</span><span>Over time, it would cover the sky of Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThis isn\u2019t an eternal end, but a new beginning.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The countdown to the destruction of the world began.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a great power that couldn\u2019t be ignored.\u00a0</span><span>So much had changed since the war ended.</span></p><br/><p><span>As the timer ended, Crockta could feel himself belonging to this world. He felt it accurately through his whole body.\u00a0</span><span>He already had the highest assimilation rate, but the landscape changed again once he belonged to this world.\u00a0</span><span>It was as if he took off uncomfortable glasses and saw the world clearly with his naked eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta,\u201d the war god called out.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s face was stiff. </span></p><br/><p><span>The war god continued, \u201cJust now...\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCorrect.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta didn\u2019t know what had happened. However, one thing was clear.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cShe is back.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The grey god had returned.\u00a0</span><span>All the gods could feel it.\u00a0</span><span>A strong energy could be felt coming from the north. The grey god\u2019s unique strength was like a mountain. It continued to multiply and expand.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cTearing a gap between dimensions and returning here...\u201d The war god formed a fist.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta stared into the war god\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span>The two men who had just risked their lives, they exchanged a unanimous unspoken consent.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIf you\u2019re really serious about what you said...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI will stop her.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The moment that Crockta responded, a new message appeared.\u00a0</span><span>It was for the users still under the influence of the grey god.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Do you want to go back?]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Defeat the grey god.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[The last quest has started.]</span></p><br/><p><span>That was it.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta felt like it was a message from the grey god to himself.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he recalled the grey god.\u00a0</span><span>He had never felt anything bad from her. She had expressed compassion for the destiny of the world and the inevitable destruction.\u00a0</span><span>The \u2018vision of the grey god\u2019 which she always saw was gruesome enough to eat away at Crockta\u2019s spirit during the short time he\u2019d had it.</span></p><br/><p><span>She called out to him, \u2018Defeat me.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>He walked towards the war god and said, \u201cI will surely stop her.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta had been able to get a brief glimpse of her mind.\u00a0</span><span>She wanted to destroy this world out of compassion. In her mind, the world was entering an irreversible death, and the people here were just enjoying a finite life.</span></p><br/><p><span>Eventually, it became his mission to save the world again.\u00a0</span><span>He would confront her with all of his strength...\u00a0</span><span>And accept the result.\u00a0</span><span>This was a gamble with the fate of the world on the line.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta looked around.</span></p><br/><p><span>The expressions of the gods were serious, the expedition members were pleased without knowing anything, and the orcs were bewildered. The strong people who had reached the peak of the world realized that something was wrong in the world, causing them to stare at Crockta and the war god.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the meantime, a man walked towards Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>It was a robed man.\u00a0</span><span>He slowly took off his hood to reveal a familiar face.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta called out his name, \u201cGordon.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Gordon smiled.\u00a0</span><span>However, there were mixed emotions in that smile.\u00a0</span><span>It was a sad smile.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo, this is ridiculous, how...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Laney was hiding using stealth in order to relay the war.\u00a0</span><span>All of the talented BJs had been killed, so the situation at the end of the war was only being relayed by a professional videographer of the Undergames Channel and Laney.</span></p><br/><p><span>She had a hunch that the best jackpot was when Crockta had shown mercy to the war god. Laney had formed a fist as she stared at Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>However, after that...</span></p><br/><p><span>A strange system message popped up saying the game was over, then a timer appeared.\u00a0</span><span>Nothing happened after the timer ended. So, she just shrugged and continued to film the video.\u00a0</span><span>However, strange words appeared in the Youvids chat room where she was relaying in real time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u300cSad and Slow: I went to the chat room of another BJ, and he is freaking out because he can\u2019t leave Elder Lord. The logout button has disappeared. Laney should check it \u315c\u315c\u315c\u315c\u315c</span></p><br/><p><span>You and You Me and Me: \u00a0Does that make any sense?</span></p><br/><p><span>Sad and Slow: It is real. The person is BJ Jaylee who was doing a quest. He is crying now, so check it out.\u300d</span></p><br/><p><span>Elder Lord was a virtual reality game, but there had never been any problems with its stability. Furthermore, it didn\u2019t make sense that they couldn\u2019t logout.\u00a0</span><span>Even if the user was forcibly pulled out of the capsule, there wouldn\u2019t be any big problems, with only slight aftereffects.</span></p><br/><p><span>Laney snorted and called for the logout window.\u00a0</span><span>However, it didn\u2019t appear.\u00a0</span><span>The logout window wouldn\u2019t respond, no matter how she called.\u00a0</span><span>Feeling anxious, she stopped moving.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t a problem to call her status window or quest window. However, the logout window didn\u2019t appear.\u00a0</span><span>A cold chill went down her spine.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWell, it isn\u2019t a big deal. It seems like the server is unstable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>She tried to get rid of any ominous thoughts. Then she continued her work of filming Crockta, the gods, the orcs, and the expedition forces.\u00a0</span><span>Then at that moment...</span></p><br/><p><span>[Do you want to go back?]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Defeat the grey god.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[The last quest has started.]</span></p><br/><p><span>The message windows shone.\u00a0</span><span>At that moment, she realized that something was wrong.\u00a0</span><span>From then on, she focused on logging out instead of her broadcast. All of her attention was stuck on the logout window.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was still no reaction.\u00a0</span><span>Gradually, ominous stories started to appear in the chat room.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u300cBreaking News Man: \u2605\u2605Breaking News\u2605\u2605 People have died in the Elder Lord capsules \u2605\u2605Breaking News \u2605\u2605 Check the news.</span></p><br/><p><span>I\u2019m a Coward: \u3137\u3137\u3137\u3137 What is really going on?</span></p><br/><p><span>Breaking News Man: \u2605\u2605Breaking News \u2605\u2605 More people all over the world are dying in the Elder Lord capsules \u2605\u2605Breaking News \u2605\u2605 </span></p><br/><p><span>Sad and Slow: This is real \u315c \u3160 \u315c Laney, be careful.\u300d</span></p><br/><p><span>People pulled from the capsules were brain dead, and the number of those dying from Elder Lord was on the rise.\u00a0</span><span>Laney didn\u2019t show it outwardly, but she felt like crying. She continued trying to make the logout window appear, but it didn\u2019t.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then at that moment... </span></p><br/><p><span>\u300cThe chat window has been paused.\u300d</span></p><br/><p><span>This message appeared, and the chat window became quiet.\u00a0</span><span>Then another message popped up.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u300cAdministrator: Laney, calm down and listen to the end. Evacuate to a safe place and follow our instructions. This is a real-life situation. Once again, it is an actual situation. At present, there is a serious problem. The user\u2019s safety is at risk. Please move to a safe place. \u300d</span></p><br/><p><span>Laney realized this was a real problem.\u00a0</span><span>Her hands began to tremble. In Elder Lord, she was an assassin class, a heroine who covered all sorts of crimes. However, in reality, she was just an ordinary person.\u00a0</span><span>Until the chat window was stopped, scary information had been circulating.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo way...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Laney left the battlefield hurriedly and started running towards a safe city.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>The Elder Lord incident emerged.

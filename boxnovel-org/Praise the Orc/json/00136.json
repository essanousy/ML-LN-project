Contrary to his manly body, his face showed the traces of time.\u00a0</span><span>\"I don\u2019t know what it is, but it seems like you are worried about something.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He placed a big beer glass in front of Kenzo. It seemed bigger in comparison to the average gnome\u2019s size.\u00a0</span><span>In the hands of the muscular gnome, the beer looked even bigger.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I'll buy you a glass.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"...Thank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>This was Quantes Bar.\u00a0</span><span>It was located near the inns, but it was a place where men drank forlornly under the dim lighting.\u00a0</span><span>They both drank the beer at the same time.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Yes, what is worrying you? Is it okay if I listen once?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo looked at the man, studying his wrinkled face and his deep eyes. He looked like a senior in his past life.</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a strange mood.</span></p><br/><p><span>In reality, he had no such experiences. At most, there were salary men who got drunk and old men whispering about the past. They didn\u2019t care of other drunk people.\u00a0</span><span>It was a bleak period where people became suspicious of any young person who entered a bar.</span></p><br/><p><span>But because he watched a lot of dramas and movies, Kenzo felt like he could get something from this man.\u00a0</span><span>In movies, weren\u2019t there always advisers who gave answers when protagonists lost their way?\u00a0</span><span>This gnome\u2019s appearance seemed to suggest that.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"My problem...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo opened his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>It was just an artificial intelligence anyway. He could confess his problem without any hesitation.\u00a0</span><span>\"I am learning under someone right now. He asked me to do one thing, but I will be in a difficult position if I do it. So, should I do this or not...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo was troubled.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>They might be moneylenders, but they were still users.\u00a0</span><span>It was their play style to attack NPCs.\u00a0</span><span>They didn\u2019t consider it a crime to act against NPCs. If Kenzo attacked them, he could be stigmatized as someone who attacked fellow users.</span></p><br/><p><span>That was the source of his troubles.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I don\u2019t know the details, but you seem to be in a rough spot.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnome touched his chin and ordered something from the bartender.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Bartender. Please do what I asked before.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The bartender approached with something.\u00a0</span><span>The gnome laughed and shook the contents of the bottle.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is Mukarasanebo.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Mukarasanebo...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a very precious wine in Elder Lord.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. Did your teacher make you do that while knowing your position is difficult?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"That's not it. He doesn\u2019t know about my position.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>He couldn\u2019t explain to Crockta about the relationship between users.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"He doesn\u2019t know?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cYes. He won\u2019t understand.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI see. Huhuhu.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The man laughed and poured Mukarasanebo into their cups.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo quietly stared without drinking.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This precious thing...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It\u2019s okay. Drink.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThank you.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo and the gnome drank the Mukarasanebo. He could feel the unique aroma and taste; it was indeed worthy to be a product called the nobility of wine.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Do you know why your teacher did it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Well, that...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta hadn\u2019t mentioned why he wanted Kenzo to get rid of the moneylenders.\u00a0</span><span>Maybe it was to get rid of the bad guys harming the city or there was a hidden element that Kenzo didn\u2019t know.</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnome laughed.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYou don\u2019t know anything about each other.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then is your mentor a trustworthy person?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo thought about it. Was Crockta trustworthy?\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t know much about Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Unlike the image of his species, he was very gentlemanly until he turned into an unmatched warrior in battle.\u00a0</span><span>But Crockta had saved him from the creatures in the forest. When Kenzo asked to be taught and said that it was to help people, he nodded with a satisfied expression.\u00a0</span><span>It was a short time, but Kenzo could feel what he was like as a person.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cYes. He is.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnome smiled and said, \"Then trust him.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHuh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I could tell the answer just by looking at your face.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The gnome shook the Mukarasanebo. There wasn\u2019t much left. He gave Kenzo the last cup.\u00a0</span><span>\"It is a precious drink but you can have the last cup.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo looked at the cup and shook his head.</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnome said, \"I'll tell you my story. I have lived my whole life in Quantes, but I am leaving today.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Today?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"As you can see from the Mukarasanebo, I had a lot of money. I was a successful businessman, but thanks to a little mistake, I\u2019ve lost everything. All I have now is my body, so I am going to another city to work.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnome\u2019s expression was so serene that Kenzo couldn\u2019t imagine such a story.\u00a0</span><span>The gnome continued speaking, \u201cIt is because of a loan.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo\u2019s eyes widened.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"A friend who was my most reliable adviser told me not to trust them, but I believed I could control everything. They used a crafty method to cause me to pay a tremendous amount of money. I shouldn\u2019t have believed in the foreigners who suddenly appeared...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He laughed bitterly, \"I lost everything.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo couldn\u2019t say anything. The weight of his life felt like it was pushing down on his shoulders.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Somehow, I feel like I caused your mood to become worse.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah, no.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Either way, everything is your choice. But if someone you trust is giving you advice, you should listen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnome rose from his spot.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo tried to catch him, but the gnome had already stepped back.\u00a0</span><span>\"I was lonely but I\u2019m glad I got to meet you at the end. This is the last of the Mukarasanebo, the last cup. Please enjoy it slowly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He handed money over to the bartender.\u00a0</span><span>They briefly exchanged glances. The gnome must have a long relationship with the bartender here.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Be well.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You too.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnome left the bar, walking in a regal manner under the moonlight.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo looked at the clear liquid in the cup. Mukarasanebo, the wine that was called nobility due to its flavor.\u00a0</span><span>He raised the last cup to his mouth.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was bitter.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo moved through the darkness.\u00a0</span><span>It wasn\u2019t difficult to find the users in Quantes. He tracked those who showed suspicious tendencies.\u00a0</span><span>They were careful, but he had imitated a ninja and learned tracking and stealth skills.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the process, he learned how they tightened the noose.\u00a0</span><span>They lent money to people. They used tricks to increase the interest rates, harassing those who couldn\u2019t pay it off.\u00a0</span><span>By the way, a lot of gnomes were deceived. The inhabitants of Elder Lord were familiar with these tricky methods, so they had no choice but to believe.</span></p><br/><p><span>In addition, there were users who bribed the officials of Quantes. The gnomes who appealed to the officials were dismissed.</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnome who gave Kenzo the Mukarasanebo had also been hit like this.\u00a0</span><span>The users were reproducing the scams of reality in the game.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Why aren\u2019t you giving me the money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cMoney, I don\u2019t have it. I just borrowed 100 silver but the interest rate...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"It is written! Didn\u2019t you see the contract?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I tried to pay it back but you weren\u2019t there...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then try to find us! It can\u2019t just be given to you! Do whatever it takes! Am I wrong? You should be familiar with all the people here.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>They were no different from the gangsters, or Yakuza, in reality.\u00a0</span><span>\"If you don\u2019t have the money, there is this. Your house. Sell your house. Then all the money will be paid back. Eh?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This house has been in my family for generations...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then give us the money!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHiik!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>There was a disturbance as the furniture in the house started to be smashed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cP-Please stop!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The money?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNothing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"The rate is too...we no longer...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Then get out of this house! Foreclosure!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Users armed with weapons and armor entered the house and threatened the gnomes.\u00a0</span><span>The guards of Quantes arrived after being informed of the turmoil. The users immediately changed their attitude, showing their papers and letters.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh! You worked hard! We're a little noisy, so we\u2019re sorry. Do you see these papers here? We are doing legitimate work. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The guards faced the users and saw that there were no problems with the documentation. They looked at each other and nodded.\u00a0</span><span>\"Please be careful of making a lot of noise. A report was received.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cAh. I\u2019m sorry. Hahaha.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cThen.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>After the guards left, it was a repetition of the previous situation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Typical NPCs. Kukuk. Hey guys, shake this house. What is going to happen?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cBrother. Is this little one yours?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It happened when they tried to touch the family of the victim.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo felt something inside him break.\u00a0</span><span>A memory from his past.\u00a0</span><span>Whenever he was bullied, he could endure anything about himself; however, he couldn\u2019t stand any insults to his family. However, he didn\u2019t have the power to resist.\u00a0</span><span>The wounds from that period time still hadn\u2019t healed, and felt like it had festered over with gangrene.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was why he wanted to become like a hero in cartoons and help people.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Don\u2019t be stupid.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo revealed his body and entered the house.\u00a0</span><span>The people inside were bewildered at the emergence of another user and called out, \"Who is it?\"</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo replied with his sword instead of words.\u00a0</span><span>He was a high-level user, and in recent days, he had gone through Pinnacle training with Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>The overall level of the users had increased a lot, but he could nonetheless slaughter these types of people.</span></p><br/><p><span>His claymore slashed at the users.\u00a0</span><span>They turned into white particles in an instant. The only gnome NPC working with the moneylenders was trembling.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo grabbed his collar and demanded.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"If you don\u2019t want to die, tell me where all the people in your organization are.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnome started thinking.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo swung his greatsword. A few pieces of hair from the gnome fell down. If it was a little more angled, the gnome would\u2019ve died instantly.\u00a0</span><span>The gnome shook.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"This is your last chance. One. Two...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The gnome came clean before he finished speaking.\u00a0</span><span>He told Kenzo all the important points, including the number of people in their group and the position of the leader.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo gained the information and brandished his sword. The gnome\u2019s head was hit and he fainted.</span></p><br/><p><span>The night wasn\u2019t over yet.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo began to move. The moneylenders were spread all over the place, but their core force was together.\u00a0</span><span>Kenzo dealt with the remnants. He repeated this work until it was daytime.</span></p><br/><p><span>As the users got in contact with each other, he soon became surrounded by a lot of them.</span></p><br/><p><span>Strong.\u00a0</span><span>A few were on a level similar to Kenzo.\u00a0</span><span>This made it more annoying.\u00a0</span><span>The level of the users was good enough not to bother anyone this way. Nevertheless, they gave out loans and bullied anyone who couldn\u2019t pay.</span></p><br/><p><span>It didn\u2019t matter that they were committing evil against NPCs.\u00a0</span><span>Just...he remembered the deep eyes of the gnome who bought him the Mukarasanebo.\u00a0</span><span>There was also the face of the child who looked up at the users surrounding him with fear.\u00a0</span><span>The family begging for the child not to become hurt.\u00a0</span><span>The mother\u2019s tears as she embraced her children.</span></p><br/><p><span>All of this meant he couldn\u2019t hold back his irritation.\u00a0</span><span>He couldn\u2019t bear these feelings and wielded his blade.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"You are a user like us. What are you trying to do?\u201d They asked him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo ignored them and rushed in.\u00a0</span><span>It was an unfavorable fight.\u00a0</span><span>There wasn\u2019t much difference in level and they outnumbered him. Maybe some of them were superior to Kenzo. He was alone.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, it didn\u2019t feel like that.\u00a0</span><span>He grasped his claymore and recalled the time with Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Swords were flying towards him.\u00a0</span><span>There were many of them. A fast speed.\u00a0</span><span>He shouldn\u2019t have been able to avoid them.</span></p><br/><p><span>However, Kenzo didn\u2019t die.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Your assimilation rate has risen.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Your assimilation rate has risen.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Your assimilation rate has risen.]</span></p><br/><p><span>[Your assimilation rate has risen...]</span></p><br/><p><span>Unity with the world.\u00a0</span><span>The world of Elder Lord was pushing at his back.</span></p><br/><p><span>Kenzo gripped his claymore and plunged into the encirclement.</span></p><br/><p><span>Then.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>The world slowed.</span></p><br/><p>Glossary of Common Korean Terms.</p><br/><p>Praise the Orc:\u00a0Glossary Link.\u00a0</p><br/><p>Current schedule:\u00a0There will now be 14 chapters a week, meaning two chapters every day.</p><br/><p>I have also updated my\u00a0Patreon\u00a0to reflect my new novels.

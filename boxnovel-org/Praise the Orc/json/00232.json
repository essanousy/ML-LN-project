They were relieved to avoid the direct battle. At the same time, they doubted whether Raven could deal with such a monster. They felt anxiety about what would happen if he was crushed.\u00a0</span><span>Jung Ian walked forward with more pressure on his shoulders than any of them.\u00a0</span><span>He shook his shoulders to get rid of the tension.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u201cSigh.\u201d</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Ian looked up at Parthenon while holding his greatsword.\u00a0</span><span>He felt gazes fixed on his back.\u00a0</span><span>It was always like this.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone was watching him. \u00a0</span><span>At first, it was his little sister and later his fellow comrades.

It gazed down at him.\u00a0</span><span>The yellow eyes were aimed at Ian.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u201cI don\u2019t like those eyes.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Ian placed the greatsword on his shoulders. The monster\u2019s eyes alone were bigger than his body.\u00a0</span><span>He had never met such a big monster but it was obvious where to start attacking.\u00a0</span><span>He didn\u2019t need to think about it.\u00a0</span><span>Thus, he slashed at the eyes.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u00a0\u201cKuwaaaaaah!\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>It was a surprise attack. Ian leapt in an instant and slashed at Parthenon\u2019s eyes.\u00a0</span><span>It had red blood.\u00a0</span><span>Ian landed and moved to the side to avoid the scattered blood.\u00a0</span><span>Parthenon leapt to a great height. Ian attacked in this gap.</span><span>\u00a0He gradually accelerated.\u00a0</span><span>The experience he had in Elder Road passed through his mind.\u00a0</span><span>The monster\u2019s blind attacks couldn\u2019t harm him. Ian occupied the enemy\u2019s blind spot. He jumped onto Parthenon\u2019s body and reached the end of its shoulders.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u00a0\u201cKuwoooook!\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Parthenon opened its mouth and something poured out.\u00a0</span><span>It was liquid. Ian instinctively avoided it. The liquid that spilled on the ground melted the earth.\u00a0</span><span>It was a terrible substance.\u00a0</span><span>It made a deep hole.\u00a0</span><span>Ian climbed Parthenon\u2019s back while confirming the strength of the fluid. Parthenon turned its head and sprayed liquid on Ian again.\u00a0</span><span>It was aiming to intercept him with the liquid.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Ian felt disgusted at the sight. Rather than backing away, he ran forward.\u00a0</span><span>The black stream of liquid narrowly passed over his head.\u00a0</span><span>God Slayer burned.\u00a0</span><span>It moved horizontally across the neck.\u00a0</span><span>The mucus covering the neck didn\u2019t break.\u00a0</span><span>Then fire emerged from Ian\u2019s sword, God Slayer. The moment it touched, the flames burned the layer of mucus. Then it sliced through Parthenon. The flesh was cut and blood poured out.\u00a0</span><span>Ian was covered with blood. The blood was warm. He hurriedly shook it off to secure his vision and hit Parthenon\u2019s teeth that were aiming for him.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u201cKuoooooh.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Parthenon started to struggle. Ian jumped up and balanced his body.\u00a0</span><span>Parthenon was unable to shake off the presence of the person on its back. They rolled down together.\u00a0</span><span>The tunnels collapsed and the ruined city was destroyed. Parthenon\u2019s back rubbed against the ground. The horrible liquid scattered everywhere.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u00a0\u201cKuock!\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Ian escaped from Parthenon before he got involved in its struggle.\u00a0</span><span>The monster didn\u2019t realize Ian\u2019s position and kept rolling.\u00a0</span><span>Ian looked at its condition. Its left ankle was tattered and it was in pain every time it walked. It seemed to have hit it somewhere. The skin was also irritated, as if it had been damaged by the body fluids.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Parthenon stared down at Ian.</span><span>\u00a0Ian smiled and raised his body. The sun was once again covered, casting a shadow.\u00a0</span><span>Parthenon stomped down towards Parthenon.\u00a0</span><span>Ian quickly rolled to the side to evade. The speed of Parthenon gradually accelerated. Ian\u2019s body also accelerated into the world of Pinnacle.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>The monster wriggled and Ian cut at its ankle.\u00a0</span><span>In the aftermath, mucus was scattered instead of dust. Ian shook his head to get rid of the substance blocking his eyes.\u00a0</span><span>Parthenon\u2019s speed was getting faster. It became difficult to shake off, even in the world of Pinnacle. Ian moved his legs and headed to Parthenon\u2019s back again.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Then Parthenon spat out a black liquid.\u00a0</span><span>It deliberately aimed for him. Ian gave up on climbing and jumped away. He rolled on the ground to minimize the impact.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Parthenon\u2019s liquid chased him.</span><span>\u00a0It scattered like a net, rather than a targeted stream. Ian moved to the side.\u00a0</span><span>His ankle was throbbing and he couldn\u2019t completely escape.\u00a0</span><span>He avoided a fatal injury. But a part of the black liquid touched his calf. Smoke rose as the skin melted. Ian gritted his teeth and poured a potion on it.\u00a0</span><span>He was able to wash off the liquid but the skin was still damaged.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Ian\u2019s face distorted.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u00a0\u201cYou bastard...\u201d</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>He swung his greatsword. His tattoos flashed. His body shook as a fearful aura emerged. Causality reversed and the atmosphere erupted.\u00a0</span><span>Ian moved forward again. Parthenon was waiting for him.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Ian laughed wildly.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; text-align: center\"><br/></p><p></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm; text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><br/></p><p></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>The fallen Parthenon squeezed out all its power to raise its head.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>An enemy stood on its belly.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>A little guy that it had battled for hours with. The result was its defeat. It was difficult to believe. How could this dimension have someone so strong? Nothing could penetrate Parthenon\u2019s skin and when it stomped its feet, the enemies were crushed and died instantly.\u00a0</span><span>But one person. A ghastly aura spewed from this small body and hacked at Parthenon\u2019s flesh. As the fight continued, its wounds increased.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Its confidence faded as fear grew.\u00a0</span><span>It was afraid of its opponent.\u00a0</span><span>Parthenon couldn\u2019t accept this emotion.\u00a0</span><span>Then its body no longer moved.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u201cKuwooooooh...\u201d</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Suddenly, flames aimed towards the centre of its belly.\u00a0</span><span>The tiny being grinned at it.\u00a0</span><span>It was a ridiculing smile.\u00a0</span><span>The first thing Parthenon felt was anger. However, that anger turned to fear again. Parthenon saw the streak of flames aiming at its belly.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>The blade penetrated its belly.\u00a0</span><span>The pain began with a light tingling became flames that spread out all over its belly.</span><span>\u00a0Parthenon moved its eyes and started to scream. It caused an earthquake. Blood and black liquid spilled from its abdomen, spraying everywhere.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Parthenon\u2019s body shook like it was having a seizure but the blade of flames penetrating its centre didn\u2019t shake. It just dug deeper. The energy of the sword bit inside it. Parthenon stopped its seizures.\u00a0</span><span>It looked at the small existence through blurred eyes.\u00a0</span><span>He watched Parthenon from beginning to end.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u201cIt isn\u2019t enough yet?\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>The moment he drew the sword to stab it again.\u00a0</span><span>Parthenon\u2019s head fell.</span><span>\u00a0Ian sighed and sat down on the monster\u2019s belly.</span><span>\u00a0The monster didn\u2019t move anymore.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u00a0\u201cParthenon has been killed.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>He radioed headquarters and lay down.\u00a0</span><span>It was difficult to lift his heavy blade. His entire body was screaming. For the time being, he needed to rest. In particular, his left ankle was overwhelmingly swollen.\u00a0</span><span>In the distant sky, helicopters and fighter jets were flying. They would send ground troops into the city and would burn the remnants of another dimension.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Benghazo was recaptured.\u00a0</span><span>This was the land of humanity again.\u00a0</span><span>The hunters came running to him.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u201cYou have gone to a lot of trouble.\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u201cIt was a great battle!\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u201cCrockta right?

It was mixed in all different types of languages but the machine in his ear translated the language. \u00a0</span><span>Ian smiled and waved her hand. The people cheered. The combat support group thanked Ian through the radio.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>At this moment, Ian shouted,\u00a0</span><span>\"Retreat!\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>The hunters flinched at the sudden shout.\u00a0</span><span>Something popped out to the side of the collapsed Parthenon.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u00a0\u201cWhat?\u201d\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u201cWahhhhh!\u201d</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>The hunters stepped back.\u00a0</span><span>It was an unidentified creature. It spread its wings. The membranes covered with mucus spread wide open.\u00a0</span><span>Apart from the wings, the monster was a little bit bigger than humans.\u00a0</span><span>However, Ian\u2019s nerves remained cool.\u00a0</span><span>Ian looked for God Slayer. It was immediately after he released his tension so he didn\u2019t have enough strength.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>The unidentified monster flapped its wings and flew in front of Ian.\u00a0</span><span>It stared at Ian in the air.\u00a0</span><span>It had a human shape with arms and legs. On the insect-like face, the distinctive mucus started oozing from the skin. Its red eyes stared at Ian.\u00a0\u00a0</span><span>Ian was just about to stand up when it shook its head.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Now wasn\u2019t the time.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Ian knew the monsters had a type of intelligence but this was the first time there was something close to communication. Ian\u2019s instincts told him to get rid of it immediately.\u00a0</span><span>It was a strong enemy.\u00a0</span><span>If he didn\u2019t kill it, the monster would become a bigger enemy later.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>The unidentified monster pointed in one direction, saying nothing.\u00a0</span><span>Ian stared at it blankly. There was nothing in the southeast direction.</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>\u201cWhat...?\u201d</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Then it fled without saying anything else. It flew in the southeast direction it pointed to.\u00a0</span><span>It was a tremendous speed.\u00a0</span><span>Ian sat down and sighed.\u00a0</span><span>He already had no power left in his body after the battle with Parthenon. It might be fortunate that the unidentified monster disappeared like this.\u00a0</span></p><p style=\"margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm\"><span>Ian waved his hand.

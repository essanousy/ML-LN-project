But he had the most necessary qualification for a warrior.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta heard about the circumstances between Hoyt and Thompson and raised his fist without any hesitation.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018So young orc, will you help me?\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Yes. I will do my best to help.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt had a hunch that night. So he told Crockta the most important knowledge he knew.\u00a0</span><span>Endless repetition would cause one to be the best in battle. Wielding a perfect strike that couldn\u2019t be reached with dazzling attacks.</span></p><br/><p><span>A strike that only a warrior who struggled could achieve.\u00a0</span><span>A miracle created by tens of thousands, tens of millions of repetition.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u2018Go towards the pinnacle. And beyond me.\u2019</span></p><br/><p><span>Today, Crockta responded to that question.\u00a0</span><span>Beyond the Pinnacle, beyond the Hero, to a realm that nobody reached, Crockta\u2019s greatsword swept towards the war god in a beautiful curve.\u00a0</span><span>It was a dazzling trajectory.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Beautiful.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>The fire of the war god was raging, but Hoyt smiled.\u00a0</span><span>Everyone died in the end.\u00a0</span><span>In the end, everything born would sink into death.\u00a0</span><span>That was why warriors risked their lives and jumped into death. Great warriors would never be erased.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Imperishable.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Hoyt could see it.\u00a0</span><span>On Crockta\u2019s back, he could see the great warriors that he knew.</span></p><br/><p><span>That wasn\u2019t all. The images of many warriors were superimposed on Crockta. Crockta\u2019s weapon was a greatsword, an axe, and a halberd. Their willpower, which had never disappeared, was now manifested through Crockta\u2019s hands.</span></p><br/><p><span>The trajectory broke through the flames.\u00a0</span><span>The flames of the war god were destroyed, and the things he constructed with his power diminished.\u00a0</span><span>The call of war, which never went out, was separated.</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta\u2019s blow continued without stopping.\u00a0</span><span>The gigantic body of the war god fell to the ground.\u00a0</span><span>It was split in two.\u00a0</span><span>The war god sank down.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah...!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Oh my god...!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cNo way!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The gods cried out. The expedition members dropped their weapons.\u00a0</span><span>They watched carefully.\u00a0</span><span>The war god\u2019s upper and lower bodies separated, falling to the ground.\u00a0</span><span>The massive body slumped to the ground. The power of the Colosseum disappeared. The power of the war god, which could burn the world, faded away.</span></p><br/><p><span>The body gradually shrank and became the same size as a human.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKuwaaah...\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The war god returned to the shape of Aklan with serious damage. He tried to repair the wound, but the divine power in God Slayer was biting him.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cKeheok...this is ridiculous...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Even the war god didn\u2019t know what had happened.\u00a0</span><span>He had pulled the power he used to support the world and tried to destroy Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>It was a blow to the heart.\u00a0</span><span>However, he was defeated by Crockta\u2019s blow. The wounds on his chest would affect the body that lived in Olympus. His divinity was cracked.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cHah, heok...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The war god raised his upper body.\u00a0</span><span>He sat up and stared at Crockta. Crockta was looking down at the war god from the position of a winner.\u00a0</span><span>The war god, who controlled war and struggle, was defeated by a mortal.\u00a0</span><span>It was a humiliation that wouldn\u2019t be forgotten until the world was destroyed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Congratulations, Crockta.\"</span></p><br/><p><span>However, he spoke graciously.\u00a0</span><span>He was the war god and knew the honor involved in a duel. The loser needed to maintain his honor.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cKill me now.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>The war god threw away his weapon. He held out his neck.\u00a0</span><span>\"I have lost the duel, so finish me.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He had never once experienced defeat. He had worked to stop the grey god, but now he lost the duel.\u00a0</span><span>Therefore, it was much more painful.\u00a0</span><span>He strained his eyes to remember his opponent\u2019s face.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWar God.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta opened his mouth.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta also wasn\u2019t in a perfect condition. His whole body was in tatters due to injuries. He staggered over to the war god.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cWar God. Admit your defeat.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI admit it.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Crockta slowly lifted God Slayer.\u00a0</span><span>If Crockta dealt the final blow with God Slayer, the war god would take a long time to restore the divinity. Some might even be lost forever.\u00a0</span><span>The war god closed his eyes.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201c......\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However.\u00a0</span></p><br/><p><span>Nothing happened.\u00a0</span><span>The war god soon opened his eyes again.\u00a0</span><span>God Slayer was placed on Crockta\u2019s shoulder.</span></p><br/><p><span>The war god asked,\u00a0</span><span>\"What are you doing?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cLet me tell you one thing.\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta replied with a smile.\u00a0</span><span>His voice rang out through the battlefield.\u00a0</span><span>\"A warrior doesn\u2019t attack unarmed people.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>An unprecedented, massive war was triggered by the divine message. It was a racial war where the expedition and the gods aimed to destroy the orcs.</span></p><br/><p><span>Now.</span></p><br/><p><span>It was stopped by Crockta.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>Elder Lord\u2019s community user, with the nickname \u2018Evening Game.\u2019\u00a0</span><span>He previously made a post claiming that Crockta was a user.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Definitely suspicious...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He was still trying to prove his theory. It was a type of sixth sense. Crockta was obviously a user.\u00a0</span><span>So he watched closely when Crockta\u2019s steel helmet was damaged during the battle. However, it was only half broken and his forehead wasn\u2019t revealed.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Ah...that...how?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The war god\u2019s final blow.\u00a0</span><span>He appeared as a giant and his flaming sword descended towards Crockta, like a great king about to destroy the world.\u00a0</span><span>Evening Game believed that Crockta would die and that his body would scatter into white particles, revealing himself as a user to the world.</span></p><br/><p><span>By the way, Crockta won.\u00a0</span><span>The war god was blown apart.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"......!\"</span></p><br/><p><span>It was such a dazzling scene that he couldn\u2019t open his mouth for a while.\u00a0</span><span>It was a simple swing towards the flames, but the sequence of movements was more beautiful than anything he had seen before.</span></p><br/><p><span>In these simple movements, Crockta showed everything that a warrior needed.\u00a0</span><span>Looking at the scene, even a person who knew nothing about Elder Lord would know what type of warrior Crockta was.\u00a0</span><span>It was a great blow.</span></p><br/><p><span>He muttered,\u00a0</span><span>\"Nothing...he is the real thing...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He grabbed his head.\u00a0</span><span>He might be a persistent conspiracy theorist but even he couldn\u2019t claim that Crockta was a user after seeing this scene.\u00a0</span><span>No human could do it.</span></p><br/><p><span>In the video, Crockta declared to the fallen god.</span></p><br/><p><span>[A warrior doesn\u2019t attack unarmed people.]</span></p><br/><p><span>A real hero.\u00a0</span><span>It was the figure of a warrior who showed mercy to the one who wanted to exterminate him.\u00a0</span><span>Who was the god and who was the mortal?</span></p><br/><p><span>On the screen, the orcs raised their weapons and roared.\u00a0</span><span>The orc army, who appeared in the latter half of the battle, bent to one knee and bowed to Crockta.\u00a0</span><span>Even the gods and expedition members saluted him.</span></p><br/><p><span>Evening Game stopped watching for a while and shook his head,\u00a0</span><span>\"Now I need to stop...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment that he thought so.</span></p><br/><p><span>His phone screen shook.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUh...?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>In order to confirm the information of the ranker \u2018Mystery\u2019, who he presumed to be Crockta, he turned on the Elder Saga information window provided by the company.\u00a0</span><span>After the fall of the Heaven and Earth Clan, Choi Hansung\u2019s momentum fell and Mystery became ranked number one.</span></p><br/><p><span>At one point, Mystery\u2019s level was marked as \u2018MAX\u2019 and didn\u2019t rise any more, with only the incredible amount of achievement points being renewed.</span></p><br/><p><span>The moment that Crockta\u2019s victory over the war god was confirmed, the achievement points of \u2018Mystery\u2019 rose at an incredible rate. Eventually, it rose to an amount larger than that of the achievements points he accumulated so far. </span></p><br/><p><span>Double, triple, several times the number, until the achievement points reached MAX.</span></p><br/><p><span>A private user. Level: MAX. Achievement Points: Max.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cUh...uhhh...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>It was a phenomenon he had never seen before.\u00a0</span><span>He formed a fist.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cIndeed...Crockta...!\u201d\u00a0</span><span>Crockta defeated the war god. This compensation was natural if Crockta really was Mystery.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cCrockta is clearly Mystery. Soon, people will...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He wondered what he should do.\u00a0</span><span>Should he post it on the community boards or sell it to Undergames Channel?\u00a0</span><span>He was thrilled by the scene he witnessed and his anxieties about the future.\u00a0</span><span>The sum total of achievement points displayed at the top of the ranker information window also became MAX.</span></p><br/><p><span>This was the sum total of achievement points that the users gained since the launch of Elder Lord. There were users who questioned why this was displayed, but no one knew the answer.\u00a0</span><span>Right now, it was at its highest.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cOh my god. This...!\"\u00a0</span><span>The moment he tried to take a screenshot, the ranker information window was turned off.\u00a0</span><span>\u201cUh...what is going on?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He manipulated the phone.\u00a0</span><span>The phone connection wasn\u2019t a problem. Everything else was fine. Only the ranker information window was messed up.\u00a0</span><span>Then he discovered that the homepage of the Elder Lord statistics provided by Elder Saga Corporation was down. He tried a few times but the site didn\u2019t refresh.</span></p><br/><p><span>He burst out, </span><span>\u201cWhat is happening all of a sudden? Shit!\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>However, the result was the same when he tried again.\u00a0</span><span>Despite the huge number of users, the server management ability of Elder Saga Corporation had never been limited.\u00a0</span><span>He stared at it for a while before looking at the Elder Lord connection capsule installed in the corner of the room.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cCrockta...\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>Then he looked at the screen showing the broadcast again.\u00a0</span><span>Crockta, who brought an end to the war, was talking about something in front of the war god.</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I should connect.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>His character was near Orcrox. He placed his character there because he thought that he would find evidence that Crockta was a user.\u00a0</span><span>HIs character wasn\u2019t strong so he would be in danger if he entered the war. However, now would be fine.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cI\u2019ll go and ask directly.\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>He couldn\u2019t be killed.</span></p><br/><p><span>His body entered the Elder Lord capsule.\u00a0</span><span>So, he made a decision he would end up regretting.</span></p><br/><p></p><p style=\"text-align: center\"><span>***</span></p><br/><p><span>After the battle of the war god and Crockta ended, the war was concluded.\u00a0</span><span>There were others who watched the ensuing post-war relay, but the users impressed by the battle hastily entered their capsules.</span></p><br/><p><span>From the Orc Users Brotherhood to the He\u2019s an Orc, yet still Praiseworthy members, those who participated in the battle and those who didn\u2019t, the users connected to Elder Lord to celebrate this victory.</span></p><br/><p><span>Those who disconnected to watch the war entered Elder Lord again to continue their quests.\u00a0</span><span>Those who weren\u2019t interested in the war from the beginning also continued to play Elder Lord.\u00a0</span><span>All those who connected to Elder Lord in different circumstances suddenly faced a system message.</span></p><br/><p><span>[Everyone has suffered a lot.]</span></p><br/><p><span>A free city in the center of the continent, Appalachia.\u00a0</span><span>There was a place where users gathered to exchange information and trade goods, called the user market.\u00a0</span><span>Many users enjoyed Elder Lord for its variety of possible gameplay, whether it was selling equipment, partying together to hunt monsters, or simply relaxing.</span></p><br/><p><span>And all of them faced the same system message.</span></p><br/><p><span>\u201cWe suffered? Am I the only one seeing it?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"I see it as well. What is this?\u201d</span></p><br/><p><span>\"Is this a user-wide notice?
